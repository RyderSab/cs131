In 60 translated articles(10 by other translators) she gives a good overview of the concepts behind Taoism. Everything from history, doctrine to practices are covered. <br />However there are some faults with it. The first one is that Prof. Kohn relies strictly on ancient translated texts for her formulation of Taoism and in addition many of these texts come from different schools of Taoism.  Consequently they can give the reader a confused view of what Taoism is, since the context of these texts are lacking.  As some represent different schools thought that may be at odds with others in either doctrine to practices. In addition some the texts need explanation by living Taoists in order to be understood, especially the alchemical texts.<br />As to why Kohn relied strictly translated texts and ignored the living practitioners of Taoism to formulate her view of Taoism is a mystery to me. Since it could have only enriched this book and made it a worthwhile having instead of a also-ran.  Because of this such I cannot recommend this book to people new to Taoism or seeking to further their knowledge, because some particulars are decidedly lacking. It is though thoroughly fit for those pursing a scholatistic/theoretical view of Taoism. <br />For people wanting to learn more about Taoism  in general I'd recommend:<BR>Taoist Body by Kristofpher Schipper<BR>Master Chuang by Michael Saso<BR>The Gold Pavillion by Michael Saso<BR>Taoism by Eva Wong<br />Both Schipper and Saso are ordained Taoist priests and give a real world perspective on the practice of Taoism vs. that of scholars like Kohn. And lastly they are also much more accessible for ordinary people who want to learn more about Taoism.	2003-11-15

The initial view given of the world and man is a essentially a positive one. <br />The book then proceeds through  various topics  such as:  The World and Man, Misuse of the World , Right use of the World and lastly The Transfiguration of the World in Christ.<br />However  I noticed the Orthodox view of the world and man, which was so positive in the beginning was slowly transformed in the later chapters into the same Augustinian pessimism that permeates western Christianity, replete with Original Sin though the author includes it without directly mentioning it.  Despite being about the works of St. Symeon, I felt at times I was reading excerpts from Augustine's Confessions for all intents and purpose.  <br />The picture which emerged  from my reading, especially when I got to the last chapter was that the World is a corrupt, demon infested place because of Adam and his fall. And that the only good place in the world was the Church and everything outside of it was bad.  With the role of the Church to  redeem God's corrupt creation and all the creatures contained therein from their innate state of sin.   All in all the author paints a legalistic, baneful and manichean view of man and creation.  Its all spelled out in the last chapter.<br />By the end of the book I felt as if I read two different books. One that extolled splendor and goodness of Creation and the other one which condemned Creation and man as corrupt and in a state of sin.<br />Needless to say this book is hardly one that can be used by  Christians to refute Lynn White's claim that Christianity is the cause of ecological destruction of the Earth. In fact the book inadvertently supports White's claim.	2003-08-28

Most readers will come away with a firm understanding of what Sufism is and is not, plus what it has to offer us moderns.<br />What makes this book so special among the plethora of books on sufism is this: Unlike many authors, Shaykh Rasool is a Sufi and teacher with a real lineage, so he writes from first hand experience and knowledge. Which is quite rare when one examines many of the books, where the authors are either academics or new age purveyors.<br />One cannot but help when reading this book, that one is in the presence of a true spiritual guide. Someone who lives what he teaches. As one other reviewer put it, I'm grateful that such teachers still exist in our time. It renews ones faith to say the least.<br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand what Sufism is and is a joy to read. It makes a perfect gift to religous students and others who are curious about other spiritual traditions.	2003-08-17

He covers everything from Tantra yoga, Karma yoga to Sri Aurobindo and everything in between.<br />Does he do a good job at presenting this vast subject?<BR>Yes and no. Yes he covers the various topics in some detail. Though his coverage is spotty. On some topics he does a good job and on others he glosses over. He also suffers though from accepting every guru and school as valid. As such he includes several well known cults and bogus teachers as legitimate. <br />He also does not cover the problems with gurus in the yoga tradition. A good many of them have sexually or emotionally abused their student and had to leave the schools they founded. The kundalini teachers are especially notorious in this regards.<br />Also does not adequately cover the so-called 'crazy wisdom' teaching and how it is abused.<br />Two cases of his intellectual sloppiness stand out:<BR>Adi Da(franklin Jones)- a brutal authoritarian with a god complex, Fuerstein gives a glowing review of his teachings and him as a authentic guru. Da's group is considered a cult by all cult-watch organizations. BTW Fuerstein was/is a student of Da.<br />Yogi Bhahan. This man is teaching a mish-mash system of yoga with no lineage. The Sikh's don't even do yoga in India. It is also considered a cult. Yet georg includes his teaching as valid. <br />His inclusion of these two groups makes me wonder if he really does investigate and research the various schools of yoga or accepts what they say on face value. <br />As such this work is marred by dubious scholarship. Ken Wilber's glowing comments not withstanding.<br />Despite this it is still worth purchasing. But don't accept it on his say so alone, do some research.	2003-06-25

However there is no translation of St. Maximous works to be found here, rather a interpretation of his works by Prof. Thunberg. <br />Its a long and tedious read at best and unless the reader knows the early church fathers and thinkers like Evagrius of Pontus, a lot of what is written will be 'greek' to the reader.<br />As such it should appeal to religous scholars interested in St. Maximous's theology. Others should steer clear of it.<br />Its sad that such a fine intellect like St. Maximous still lacks a decent translator. So far the only accessible translation of some of his works is the Philokalia Vol 2.<br />The reason I'm only giving it two stars is that Lungberg did not include a translation of St. Maximous and being a excessive tedious and dry read.	2003-05-27

He not only knows the subject well, but he also can convey it in a readable and lucid manner. He clears away many of the misconceptions that have risen around Tantra since the New Age movement has appropriated it. Its not about \\"sex\\" as many purveyors would want you to believe. Most westerners think that the 'Left hand Tantra' is all there is. Wrong. It is a authentic and very real path of spritual realization that is very comprehensive in its practice.<br />After Frawley dispels the misconceptions he proceeds to define aspects of Tantra and the various paths within it. Then the bulk of the book deals with the Ten Mahavidyas or wisdom goddesses. Now some of them are really hideous or nightmarish visually. Be forwarned!<br />5 of the goddesses comprise each an aspect of the divine as I understand it. The other 5 deal with personal transformation. He gives instructions on how to worship each one, along with mantras and yantras, with visualizations of each goddess.<br />Later chapters deal with the chakras, pranas, tejas and ojas.<br />Overall a fine introduction to Tantra.<br />I have only a few quips.<br />1) It is not a instruction manual per se. Yes he lists the various mantras - however its nearly impossible to learn a mantra from a book. A audio CD would be a fine complement for the next edition. Get Harish 'Tools for Tantra' for the practice methods.<br />2) The Yantras and drawings of the goddess should be done in color.<br />If you're interested in knowing more about real Tantra get this book. You won't be disapointed.	2003-04-13

But it is a good introduction to Celtic Art and patterns, plus he covers its history and shows you how to even difficult patterns. Drawing Celtic Artwork is not easy, a gifted artist and craftsman Bain makes it look easy but its not. Howeverf if you practice the basic patterns you can get pretty good at it in a reasonable period of time. I have several of Aidan Meehan's books and this one is by far the best for beginners imho. Use Meehans works when you can replicate a good many of the patterns found here.<br />It is also a fine resource for the more elaborate patterns which are not covered very well in other works. Many of these patterns can be transferred to leather, clay etc, you name it.<br />Overall if you only get one book on Celtic Art get this one and with a bit of practice your effort will be rewarded.	2003-02-09

Cohen steps the beginner through theory and then the various qigong exercises. This includes color and organ meditation, healing sounds, Big Dipper, External practices, diet, etc. He also includues some moving meditation such as the Eight brocades and Five Animals frolics.<br />Pluses:<BR>      * Covers a lot of material.<BR>      * Well footnoted and indexed.<BR>      * Has suggested routines for a student to practice.<BR>      * Gives adviced on the dangers of wrong qi practice. Which is quite important but neglected in some texts.<br />Minuses:<BR>      * No illustrations for meridians or acpuncture points. These would help explain and guide a student. Especially with the excerises like Microcosmic orbit. I found it odd that a Qigong expert like Cohen would neglect to include this.<BR>      * The moving meditations are done by drawings - I found them impossible to follow. Photos would have been much better.<BR>      * Some of the qigong exercises listed are watered down and much simplified for instance the color light meditation. It's still somewhat useful but only about a third of the exercise is <BR>there and you don't get the full effect. I don't know why Cohen <BR>does not tell the reader why he watered some qigong methods down.<br />Overall a decent introduction, as most of the material is very basic. This makes it good for the beginner but be prepared to buy other books if you want to do other methods like Microcosmic <BR>orbit or learn about meridians and acupuncture points. This also goes for trying to learn the moving meditations from this book - a beginner with no experience with this material will be lost. It will keep a dedicated beginner busy for two years or so. Once beyond that the reader is advised to seek out formal instruction or check out other texts that do include more intermediate methods. <br />If you want to do moving qigong work look elsewhere, this is not a stong point of this text. Books like Wen Mei Yu's WIld Goose Qigong or Meridian Qigong.<br />Other books that would complement this one include:<BR>Qigong Empowerment by Liang Shou-yu<BR>Meridian Qigong by Li Ding - hard to get but some online stores specializing in Qigong carry it.<BR>Wild Goose Qigong by Wen Mei Yu	2003-02-03

Only about 1/3 of the book deals with Taoism directly. BR>The other portions deals with non-Taoist concepts like Sufism's Universal Man and the Cult of the Emperor in China which he mistakes as part of Taoism and polemics agianst the western mind.<br />The book also suffers from Guenon's hyper intellectualism and syncretism. His style of writing is about as interesting as reading algrebra or a science journal - strictly third person.  The reader will not get the impression that the writer ever really practiced Taoism but read about it instead. Guenon refused to ever state his lineage in Taoism nor which school and teacher did he study under. As a result I do not take him very serious.<br />One aspect of Taoism he writes about Taoist Alchemy he is forced to used strictly western/Sufi terminology. Nor does he seem to understand the relation of the Five Elements to Taoism and to alchemical transformation practices. Later in Taoist symbolism he perpetually uses western(Masonic and Sufic) symbol interpretation.<br />Overall this book would only be of use to die hard worshippers of Guenon. I made the mistake of it being one of my first books on Taoism and I thought that Taoism was warmed over oriental masonry. If Taoism was as Guenon understood we could all forget about it as a viable religion and path. As a tract on Taoism it is no better than most new age works.	2003-01-22

So you should not get this book until you complete Vol 1, otherwise the book won't do you any good. That said, there are problems with this book, though he deals with moving qigong it is inadequately illustrated. His inner disolving process seems to be overly complex and seems to have roots in Chan Buddhism and guided imagery not Taoism, you can get the same results with loving kindness meditation as his Inner Disolving. In my mind this inclusion does not warrent the book. The book gives me the impression that Frantzis ran out material and had to toss in a lot of other stuff.<br /> The real bugger is his inclusion of supposedly Taoist sex techniques. Now this is not part of Taoism and is condemned by Orthodox Taoists as it serves no purpose outside of increasing the practitioners ego, it's been refuted since 4th Century AD Taoists. Why is he included this non-sense is beyond me unless he is trying to attract the same audience that Mantak Chia and Yudelove have. No supposed Taoist would teach this garbage. Unless Frantzis was taught by Redhats and that would not be Liu Hung Chieh. It would be someone else.<br />Overall not bad, but Shinzen Young has covered the same material in his audio tapes. But if you have completed the first book you can skip it and move on to other works whether Tantric, Buddhist or something else.	2003-01-11
US	53058474	R1WRJKOA24QPAO	0941532399	28854042	Every Branch in Me: Essays on the Meaning of Man (The Perennial Philosophy)	Books	2	8	17	N	Y	Good but marred by fanaticism	This book is a collection of articles that have been previously published in other magazines. Ostensibly about the Meaning of Man, it's real thrust is about the need to return to a traditional religious culture. The authors include Prof. Hossein Nasr, Schuon, Burkhardt, Huston Smith, Brian Keeble, Joseph Brown, Grey Henry, Marco Pallis, James Cutsinger, just to name a few. If you are already familiar with these authors and their writings you could probably skip this book.<br />The articles cover a wide variety of topics from dress, art, holy fools(a good article), modern psychology, Christianity in and its relation to Perennialism, education. <br />Brian Keeble has a fine piece on 'Work and the Sacred' the same with Thomas Yellowtail's work entitled 'Loss of Our Traditional Values'. Both are short but powerful. <br />Some of the most poignant for me were written by Grey Henry and Lilian Staveley as both wrote from the heart so to speak. Both pieces are quite moving.<br />Some are a bit outdated though. For example Titus Burckhardt rails against modern psychology which was defined in his time as Freud and Jung. However truthful neither Freud nor Jung theories mainstream anymore, western psychology has started to realize its limitations and now admits mankind's spiritual aspects with Transpersonal Psychology. Its not perfect but what is in this world?<br />Though I have some major qualms about of the articles and writers.<br />One is James Cutsinger's piece, which is a eye glazing head nodding attempt to show that one can be a Christian and still support Perenialism. He does this by invoking the obtuse Trinitarian dogma and using the works of Schuon. Whom is not recognized by any Christian doctor as a authority on Christianity.<br />The fact is unless one reduces Christian theology to the consistency of chewing gum as Cutsinger does, you cannot say that all religions are valid. A Christian if he is to be honest must state that only his religion is the only valid pathand only his way will lead to salvation. Orthodox Christianity may always be the exception to the rule of Perenialist thought.<BR>I'll take the works of Anthony Bloom or Philip Sherrard over Cutsinger anyday.<br />Now some of the writers like Linbolm and Mark Perry come off as polemical or shrill. Tage Linbom who is in essence a spiritual brother to Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson. He seems to yearn for the good old days when the Church and tyrants were the ruling authority in Europe and democracy is abolished. Simply put everything post Reformation is bad and has the mark of the Devil on it. He has nothing good to say about anything in western society. Overall his critique of modernity is shallow in comparison to Lewis Mumford's , Ellul, or Theodore Roszak. Metropolitan Anthony Bloom or Bishop Ware would have been a much better and saner representative for the classical Christian point of view than Linbom.<br />Mark Perry seems to combine both polemics and contempt, he delights in showing how brilliant he his by using Buddhist, Hindu, neo-Platonic and even Christian terms in a single sentence or paragraph. His prose is generally obscure and meanders through a variety of subjects giving each one only scant attention, each of which deserves a chapter of their own. Like Linbolm he too has a intense dislike not only of everything western but is also contemptuous of many religious practitioners in the west ranging from Buddhists, Christians, and Hindus. His implication is that they don't have a clue about their practices and since they are not practiced in a sacred culture they have no effect. Prelest anyone?<br />I've generally been a avid reader of Traditionalists like Hossein Nasr, A.Coomaraswamy, Smith and Schuon. But these newer authors like Perry and Linbom are a whole nother kettle of fish. They lack the heart and intellect that I found so attractive in Prof. Nasr's and Schuon's works.<br />As a result Perenialists, especially in the wake of 9/11 are taking a serious risk of alienating the very people they intend to reach with the inclusion of perennial fundamentalists like Perry and Linbolm and will be written off as a bunch of contemptuous, cranky religous elitists. <br />Who would benefit from this book? If you already familiar with many of perennial authors , this book won't add anything you don't already know. If you're new to the perennial idea, this is a advanced tract and not meant for a non-scholar type, unless you're comfortable switching between Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist and Christian terminologies. Stick with Huston Smith's \\"Why Religion matters\\", \\"Forgotten Truth\\" or E.F. Schumachers \\"A Guide for the Perplexed\\". Then get Hossein Nasrs \\"Knowledge and the Sacred\\". Read Schuon last, he's a difficult read and suffers from bad translations from French.	2003-01-02

Since he is anti-organization, anti-teacher he dimisses all the mystics and spiritual teachers who ever lived. They don't know but since I'm free of all that dogma and rigid teachings I know best sums up Krisnamurti's thought on god. This borders on egomania. Sadly by lowering the topic to such a low level of discourse he makes himself no better than any new age kook. Since he had no method per se and dismisses any sort development of higher level perceptions he puts himself in a box all alone. It's too bad his experience with Theosophy ruined his opinion of teachers and organizations. <br />This book could perhaps stand as signpost as too how far rational thinking can take a person. Get the book if you're interested and then get Underhill's \\"Mysticism\\" and Helminski's \\"Living Presence\\". Compare them and see who has a better understanding of spirituality and God.	2002-11-28

Gurdjieff. Though this book is guaranteed to infuriate followers of Palmer, Ichazo, Burton's cultists, Amiss etc. <br />First he takes on the Ennegram popularizes like Ichazo, Naranjo and the voluminous Helen Palmer who dared to claim instruction by a noted 4th Way teacher and turned out to never have met the man. Patterson also exposes her as a shallow new-age type of thinker with a penchant for self-promotion through her own words.<BR>She has no real lineage nor even formal instruction in the 4th way nor any real tradition for that matter. Of course the shadowy showman Ichazo(much like Castenada) is put in for good measure. He systematically goes about deconstructing Ichazo premises on the ennegram and his mythical and oft changing spiritual pedigree.<br />Patterson then goes after The Fellowship of Friends or people of the Bookmark(as known here in Calif - as his followers used to stuff burton's calling cards in 4th Way books.) A 4th way cult based on Burton's strong persona. Patterson show's Burton to be a posuer and con-artist without real instruction or lineage. Burton main claim to fame is his ability to milk money out of followers and make himself wealthy. F of F is also a considered a outright cult. Check out Steve Hassans web site for info. <br />Another target is Robin Amiss(...) and his long dead predecessor Boris Mouravieff who concocted the notion that Gurdjieff's teachings were fundamentally derived from Eastern Christianity. Amiss is shown to be a clever fabricator of facts in his book \\"A Different Christianity\\" and distorter of truths. Patterson does a fine job exposing Mouravieff motivations for doing what he did.<br />Amiss is taken to task in a systematic manner in which he compared G's teachings to Eastern Orthodox material. Replete with references he demolishes Amiss's claims. BTW all anyone needs to do is get a copy of O's \\"In Search of the Mircaluous\\" a copy of the Philokalia or Theophans works and compare them. You'l see that there is no place for a householder in serious myticism. It's for monks only. St. Theophan was a hermit and monk - hardly someone who understood the way of the householder. <BR>Also there is no mention of 'self-observation' or 'self-remembering'. Anyone whose ever practiced the Jesus Prayer and done any sort of 'self-observation' knows they are not the same.<BR>Amiss's hidden teachers are also shown to be fabrications without reality.  <br />You'll also learn how Mouravieff played a in the split between Ouspensky and G. And how he conned O into delaying publication of \\"Tales of the Miraculous\\"<br />Overall a fine book demonstrating how self-taught self-promoters can [copy] teachings and convince people they have the real thing. So much so that their followers can longer know the real deal from the fake. If Patterson comes off shrill or a purist perhaps it's because so many people have stolen from G and peddled garbage under his name. <br />Overall a fine book on that belongs estoricist reader's bookshelf.	2002-11-28

Schumacher's \\"Guide for the Perplexed\\" he does a somewhat scathing but justified attack on western secular culture. But he does it specifically from a Orthodox perspective.<BR>He also He covers a multitude of topics from Monasticism, martyrdom, chastity, women, divorce, marriage, children. Though with latter two he conveys that it is better to be celibate and single than to marry and have children. He decries what modern man has done to himself and the world - dehumanization. And goes into detail how this occurred. Overall well and good.<br />But he ignored some vital things such as the popularity of oriental spirituality like Sufism, Buddhism, Tantra, etc. That has a strong attraction on the intellectual class of the west. Instead he dimisses them as merely \\"occult\\", he seems frightened of things like acupuncture because it's not Christian. <br />I find this evasion odd as Christianity has to compete on a rather even playing field for converts. Especially in light when the Dalai Lama works often times end up on the NYT best seller list. But ironically the Dalai Lama often writes about the subjects like compassion, ethics and love. Things which Christians ought to be writing about but don't. Guess the Sermon on Mount doesn't count for much in Church teachings nowadays. <br />Though he critiques secularism he fails to acknowledge that it put an end to religous persecutions that were so frequent in the west until the enlightenment and democracy. Or provided the basis of individual freedom and rights. No church ever fought for the rights of the common man.<br />Overall the critique is good but shallow at times when the opposite is required. His style of writing is different and takes a while to get used to. <br />He also quotes various european and Russian intellectuals which most Americans would not know about or provide a list of references of their books.  <br />So who would enjoy it? If you are a Orthodox Christian you'll like it. If you are just curious about what a Christian point of view on various topics get your hands on the works of Philip Sherrard like \\"The Rape of Man and Nature\\" and \\"Human Image - World Image\\". They are hard to get but worth it. Sherrard was both a theologian and poet and writes beautifully and intelligently about many things the Clement just glosses over.  Otherwise stick with Schumacher's \\"Guide for the Perplexed\\" or Hossein Nasr's \\"Knowledge of the Sacred\\".	2002-11-02

The book stands alone, it does not require the reader to read anything else of his - unlike his latter works. <br />Ken's basic premise is that one can use the empirical science model of evaluation to spiritual domains of knowledge. Unlike Traditionalists - who are epistemological pluralists and relegate the sciences to lowest level of existence ie; matter.<BR>Where Ken is trying to do opposite that modern western science is a partner to spiritual progres by showing that it works all the way up - in theory. Which so far no major scientist has endorsed and won't happen for obvious reasons.<br />Along the way to this point Ken shows the 4 quadrandt model,holons, etc. Takes on flatland science (current mentality of viewing everything in the world as inconnected 'its' and destruction of quality and the interior domains of knowledge). His dissection of post-modernism is the best I've ever read. He exposes the contradictions within it and put's it down like a mad dog.  He also deals with the mythic aspect of religion quite well, but I'll the previous reviewers speak on this.<br />Ken, tries quite hard to make modern western science into something more than it or could be accepted by most scientists.<BR>That it can be of use in spiritual matters - which of course provokes howls of outrage by those in science. Because they already know that the interior domains can't be quantified nor measured, hence in their minds don't exist. As Ken said 'Love is reduced to serotonin levels\\" or \\"mind reduced to binary bits\\".<br />He also states that all paths end up in the same place. Though I doubt a Zennist or Christian/Sufi mystic would agree since both have diametrically opposing views on many subjects. One believes we have a soul and the other does not, the Zennists believe we don't even exist nor does the world - it's all an illusion. While the monotheisits state otherwise. How Ken can both are the sameis stretching too far.<br />His other mistake is that stating spiritual progress is a cooperative method. It is not, especially in the spiritual traditions he talks about. Whether Zen or Tibetan Buddhism or Vedanta. These are all authoritarian structures some brutual and abusive. You either play the guru's game and accept what they say or hit the highway. You don't approach your Roshi and say \\"I've accomplished 'x' or that I disagree with you're statement that I did not experience satori\\" Obedience and acceptance are hallmarks of the far eastern paths.<BR>His use of Adi Da and Chogyam Trungpa as realized teachers under scores is ignorance of his thesis. Both Da and Trungpa were/are notorius abusers of students, scam artists and took to even beating and have sex with the students and in many ways were amoral lechers of the worst kind. Yet Ken thinks these men are spiriutal adepts.  <br />Because of his blinders Ken, I believe has refused to include the ethical/moral domains in his models.  How else can one explain his admiration of Da and Trungpa.<br />In closing Ken shows himself to be broad ranging thinker and theorist but flawed in the spiritual and ethical realms. He writes about spiritual topics that only a few in any century have experienced - he most assuredly has not. Why do you think that only Deepak Chorpa endorsed this book? Not Huston Smith or any big name in spirituality - they know him.  <br />His attempt to join spirit and science won't work, both sides have too much invested in their power structures and ideas. Not to mention being incompatible on many respects. But it is a good intro to Ken, if you like this work, you'll like his other works.	2002-10-05

Another tome!<br />If you are a diehard Wilberian you'll eat it up. Lots of theoretical speculations with lots of transpersonal wording.<br />If you are new to Wilber check out The Marriage of Sense and Soul, or The Brief History of Everything. In this work Wilber throws so much new concepts, labels, categories,etc. He makes Foucault read like Cliff Notes. In short this is not a book you read but study. Earth calling Ken.<br />Now to the observations.<br />- The characters are as others said carboard cutouts. They basically serve to voice Ken's thoughts. Otherwise they are terrible, in real life nobody sane would talk like this as you'd drive people away be sheer boorishness or get pummeled. <br />Nor is there a coherent narrative of any sort. The characters are props and no real plot. It reads like a rush job.<br />- The Boomers have written about at length by others. All Ken is doing is mapping out their flaws to his theoretical system. For all their flaws the Boomers are easy pickings. They are the end product of society driven by consumerism and materialism. Although they seek out spiritual paths they end up corrupting them because they refuse adopt themselves to it. So they turn it a anemic joke. Look at Buddhism in the U.S. or what they did to Yoga or Sufism. Also they become prey to every fake guru around like Osho or Adi Da who fleece them like sheep since they never developed any ability discern the real ones from the fakes.<BR>Heck most of Ken's friends fit the boomer/newagers profile if you read One Taste. He could have written from first hand experience.<BR>  <BR>Bland, biege, self-absorbed and hypocritical defines this class well.<br />Get Lasch's The Revolt of the Elites, or Affluenza if you want understand Boomers and what drives them. Or Erich Fromms The Sane Society for an overview.<br />- Will it set you free? Nope. Ken ought to know better than that, none of his works will help in that. This is something you do on you own. Otherwise you fall into the same trap the New Agers always fall into. Reading = personal transformation.<br />- Ken seems to have gotten progressive more complicated in his writings. Works like The Atman Project, A Brief History of Everything, and Marriage of Sense and Soul. Were succinct and did not really require to read his other books to understand. <BR>At heart Ken is a syncretist and theoretician not a mystic in any way. But more along the lines of Lord Whitehead than a Rumi. Eckhart, or Milrepa. As such he's lover of ideas and thoughts.<BR>His works are growing more complex, detailed and repetitive. <BR>Hence becomming useless to spiritual seekers and only fit for map makers and intellectuals lost in thoughts.<br />Rating:<br />-3 stars for lack of narrative, too many psychobabble words and writing about a topic done much better by other authors.<br />+2 stars for content	2002-10-03

A most excellent and throught provoking book guaranteed to enrage the reader. Rampton and Stauber detail the history and mechanics of PR(or spindoctoring) with plenty of examples. There is also a good history of the father of propaganda - Edward Bernay. Whose work inspired Joseph Goebbels among others.<br />They detail the rise of Junk Science - corporate funded scientists and hacks like John Stossel or Lomborg who do hatchet jobs on people/topics that may impinge on corporate profits. And how Junk Science has terribly confused people on what's real and not. <br />The examples they use are well documented and are not afraid to name those who pretend to be experts but are nothing but PR hacks for hire. Many of those they name are \\"experts\\" that corporate conservatives(like Prager, Limbuagh, etc) call on to spin doctor tobacco, asbestos, global warming and pollution as harmless or overblown.  <br />Some reviewers consider the authors leftist - but only to those who believe that corporations know what's best for us. But IMO it's non-political for the most part(I'm a social conservative). It seemingly picks on conservative only in that they use more PR hacks than other group. Or could it be that these so-called conservative spokesmen are corporate PR hacks themselves?<br />The book's only weak point is the chapter on what to do about it. It does not really give the detail on how to defend yourself against well done spin. Nor how to protect our children against it.<br />Be that as it may, it's the best book out there on it. After reading it, you'll definityly question pundits and so-called experts who magically appear everytime there is a public protest against something or the news in general. Also you may find yourself both depressed and angry at the extent of PR in our society and how it coopts grass roots movements and trends. <BR>They manage our tastes in clothes, cars, politicians, mindless fads, etc. It's really quite enraging when you realize that a entire industry(340 billion a year) has sprung up to manipulate the ordinary American for greed and political gain, irregardless of the moral, ethical and environmental consequences. <br />Another book I highly recommend that deals with the mechanics of propaganda and how to defend yourself against it. Is Langauge in Thought and Action by S.I. Hayakawa.	2002-09-14

In it they discuss both science, religion and spirituality(mostly Echart and Hildegard) and how they intersect at points as I understand it.<br />Do they do a good job? yes and no. Yes in that both are sincere in their efforts. Sheldrake stands out as the better of the two intellectually. No in that Fox falls down in several areas.<br />1. He commits a serious epistemological error by confusings metaphysical levels of the spirit and soul with material levels of existence. For Fox A = C this is a big no no. Angels are not atomic paritcles and the soul is not the body.  Reification is plain wrong.<br />2. He bases the bulk of his newly created theology on selected portions of Eckhart, Hildegard and Rumi. This is dangerous, since these were mystics of a high order their writings were never meant to be read as one reads a newspaper or literally as Fox wants to do. Also none the people he mentioned were rebels like himself. These mystics worked within the religous framework of the time. To try to create an exoteric framework from esoteric writings which is what Fox has done is fraught with problems, especially when you are not their equal.<br />This is my biggest problem with Fox. Instead of trying to show the reader the differences between science and religion he's trying to peddle his new religion of creation spirituality. Which is gnosis without gnosis in disguise.<br />3. As for Fox's understanding of Catholic or Christian religion in general, he has blinders on.  Especially when he comments on the great Cathedrals of Europe. He fails to understand or evem see their symbolism, instead he find's solace in their crypts of all places - this is neurotic. This man loves being in the dark and would like to see all new churchs built underground. His attitude is positively Manichean in nature.<br />Sheldrake also confuses the readers with his understanding of science in general. Science deal with the quantitative and measurable aspects of materialism. It cannot deal with qualities nor with metaphysics. To use science to justify religion is sloppy thinking and equivalent to building a house on shifting sands.<br />So my rating is:<br />** stars<br /> -1 star for lack of a index and specific sources for the quotes Fox used.<br /> -1 star for sloppy epistemology and for Fox trying peddle his new religion instead.<br /> -1 star for using on the back cover &quot;institutionalized science and mechanistic religion&quot; it should mechanistic science and institutionalized religion. Religion may be dull at times but never a machine<br /><br />The book fails in trying to bring together the strands of science, religion or spirituality. Which nobody has ever really done well.

And how it turned Christianity into a religion of guilt and fear among other things. His assumption is correct in that most Churches would collaspe without the twin pillars of guilt and fear supporting them. Modern day churches have reduced Jesus to a afterlife fire insurance salesman and malignant thug to the unbelievers. How God became a burden to man not a joy and repsite under Augustine's theology.<br />Now St. Augustine's(Too bad the Catholics went with him instead of St. Maximos the Confessor - there would have been no guilt culture) manichean pessimism is fair game. Had Fox stayed with this as his main topic he'd been alright. I mean look at the popularity of that ugly \\"Left Behind series\\" that rejoices in people suffering.  Fox could have had a field day dealing anti-life, nature desecration theology and general social deviancy of many protestant denominations. <br />Instead he uses this as a launching point for his new religion called creation spirituality which is loosely based on the Christian mysticism of Master Eckhart and many new age concepts plus a dose of political correctness. Essentially it's a movement based on a syncretic mysticism - with no real experiential basis in fact. <br />Does it work - doubtful.  It won't outlive Fox. As a student of Eckhart he ought to remember what happened to Eckharts contemporaries like the Brethern of the Free Spirit or Suso. Mysticism without a rigourous and moral outerlife usually ends badly. There are legit reasons why the Church frowned upon it.<br />Though I am no fan of Fox I cannot give Fox only one star. He's seems sincere but a bad theologian and is no mystic. But compared with much of the baneful teachings and pap put out by most Christian sects it is at least positive and does not threaten you with the \\"bad place\\" as Twain would put it, nor slap you around with guilt.  So use it as launching point and remeber St. John of the ladder's saying.<br />\\"Do not be surprised that you fall every day; do not give up, but stand your ground courageously.<BR>And assuredly, the angel who guards you will honour your patience. --St John Klimakos \\"<br />After reading this examine Underhill's Mysticism and Fruits of the Spirit. Read E.F. Schumachers \\"Guide for the Perplexed.\\"<br />Charles Tart \\"living the Mindful life\\" most of Tart's work is good for an experiential base, Anthony bloom \\"Beginning to Pray\\" - traditional but very good.

Often not for the better in many respects.<br />We live in a society that does not use machines but is more and more used by them. It shapes our world view. Postman attempts to trace it's effect on us from the beginning. Overall he does a fine a job. Although a easy read many of the topics require closer scrutiny and thinking. Which is good, he wants you to think about whats happening not just accept what he has to say.<br />In one chapter he roasts the medical industry's infatuation with new technology while the doctors neglect their patients. Patients invariably are reduced to slabs of meat on a assembly line. He makes the salient point that information is not understanding, which is usually ignored by most promoters of technopoly.<br />Another chapter deals with 'scientism' which is science distorted into a intolerant fundamentalist belief system and its effects on our society. This chapter is his most humorous as he disects some the masters of the obvious(Dilbert like scientists who think they have discovered something profound but what most people on the street already know)Like people are afraid of death and that open minded people tend to be open minded. That's right Ph.d's have done studies to prove these notions! Perhaps a better title for this chapter would have been \\"the marching morons of science.\\"<br />The last chapter deals on how to resist technology in our daily lives. Which he sums ups in several points(not all of them are listed in this review). Though it's not enough in my opinion, considering technolopy's corrosive influence on people and cultures throughout the world. Things need to be addressed at the nation policy level if anything is to be really changed.<br />* who do not regard the aged as irrelevant<br />* who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest form of human  achievement.<br />*  who are at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding.<br />* who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical power of numbers, do not regard calculations as an adequate substitute for judgement or as synonym for truth.<br />The book is a good starting point to informing oneself on the minuses of technology. Though dated much of his observations are still relevant and a good antidote to high tech mavens like Kelly, Moravec and their ilk. Another good book is David Ehrenfeld's \\"Beginning Again\\" written from a profession biologist POV. Or better yet, get Wendell Berry's tract \\"Life is a miracle\\" which a rather thorough disection of technolopy's epistemology and what lies beneath it's pretty public facade.s need to be addressed at the nation policy level if anything is to be really changed.<br />* who do not regard the aged as irrelevant<br />* who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest form of human  achievement.<br />*  who are at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding.<br />* who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical power of numbers, do not regard calculations as an adequate substitute for judgement or as synonym for truth.<br />The book is a good starting point to informing oneself on the minuses of technology.

That the methods that teach us the \\"how to\\" have been lost or replaced with emotional indulgance pretending to be spirituality. As Needleman says \\"all real religions produce results.\\" The inability for mainstream Chrisitian chruches to do that and even keep members is a sobering reminder that something has gone wrong within western Christianity.<br />So professor Needleman turns to the more intact Eastern Orthodox Church and does this by using several contemporary Christian thinkers and some of the Orthodox Saints like St. Symeon the New Theologian and St. Gregory Palamas, Thomas Merton, Metropolitan Anthony Bloom, Gurdjieff, and Father Sylvan (it is debateble if Father Sylvan was real, but if he was, I sure hope Prof. Needleman publishes this man's manuscript, hint hint). To illustrate modern Christianity's plight.<br />Though I have a problem with his inclusion of Gurdjieff. Gurdjieff teachings were not necessarily Christian per se. Gurdjieff advocated the path of the householder not the monk nor the priest. Christianity has no path for the householder who wishes to pursue theosis.<br />He's right in my opinion, if you examine the Philokalia, though comments from St. Maximus the Confessor, or St. Symeon the New Theologian supports Needleman's assertion that methods once existed for transformation. Though not couched in our modern day verbage, but it's there if you can see. BTW Needlman illustrates this via St. Symeon's understanding on how to fulfill the Sermon on the Mount show just how far away we are from being Christians.<br />But as Needleman implies it is not a continuous or living tradition like Sufism or Buddhism where the teachings can be passed on from teacher to student. Instead it is lost and sometimes someone is able to reconstitute \\"lost Christianity\\" though it dies again with the teacher. This is still the crux of the matter.<br />He does'nt offer a solution to this though. He essentially puts the onus on the seeker.<br />This is no \\"new age\\" tract by any means nor a how-to book. It is more along the lines of a question and search. Prof. Needleman does a fine job footnoting, and referencing writings for his argument. Not to mention being a fine writer to boot. But this book is a slow read because he covers concepts that quite unfamiliar to most. If you want easy to read get Chopra.<br />I'd recommend this book to any Christian who's curious as to what happened to spiritual component in Christianity. He does not try to steer you to another religion as some suggested. But to re-examine it in a new light.<br />Sadly like so many books of this kind it is out of print and instead we get Chorpa, Redfield and the Prayer of Jabez (sigh).<br />I'd also recommend<br />Man and Nature by Hossein Nasr for overview of what's happened to the west and modern Christianity.<br />Waking Up by transpersonal psychologist Charles Tart on the pychology and mechanics of human perception, understanding, and waking up.lution to this though.

Like many modern academics and a deconstructionist, he supposes that that the early inhabitants of the Levant and Palestine had short attention spans or bad memories like Crossan and other academics. From this supposition Crossan works to disect, redact and strip away any flesh or meaning from the Gospels (including the Gospel of Thomas). <br />The problem for Crossan, is that ancient people had far better memories than he'll ever know. When you consider bards in the Central Caucus region could recite the Epic of Gilgamesh from memory, or the bards of Serbia who could do like wise with similar tales. This phenomena is documented, but yet Crossan and the Jesus Seminar people, impose their limtations on those in the past. This is shoddy anthropology and smacks of promoting a point of view with selective research. The methodology overall is flawed and tells me more about Crossan than it does Jesus.<br />Sadly when all is said and done, what's left of the Gospels is very short uninspired prose that reads like newsprint. It is very doubtful such prose could have ever been uttered by Jesus considering how tepid and banal the translations turned out to be. Let alone inspire anyone to follow it. It makes Jesus out to be a boor and second rate rabble rouser and the Apostles a group of nincompoops by following him.<br />The book should appeal to reformists or the New Age type Christians like Spong and others of his ilk. If you are of Orthodox, Catholic or a more traditional Protestant denomination there is nothing here for you. <br />In closing, it won't get you nearer to the truth of what Jesus did or did not say. Though it will tell you much about Crossan's<BR>agenda driven research.	2002-07-18

Don't feel sorry about making lots of dough, even if it's a immoral occupation - you deserve it was the main message I got. Ok, I know there's more to it than that. <br />But when the author in Chap 20 says money can buy you everything even love, I was vexed. Or that ethics and morality can be bought and sold like a pair of sneakers.  And that unless we buy them, we cannot understand the things we can't buy! So if you're middle class forget understanding higher concepts, you don't got the bucks to buy enlightenment. Hmmm sounds like Sam Walton meets Eckhart meets The Fellowship of Friends. Everything is reduced to transactionalism. No meanings or values only cost. <BR>Your teacher is the Benjamin Franklin in your wallet.<br />It's odd that Needleman promotes a idea which would condemed by any authentic spiritual tradition in the world.<br />Overall Prof. Needleman did a good job, but just barely, his style of writing is as usual, excellent. But content wise it is not up to par with his earlier works on philosophy or religion. <BR>The target audience which again seems to be well off folks with guilt trips, yuppies, dot commies, etc. Ought to love it. But start at chapter 20 cause that's where it gets interesting.<br />If you work hard at a blue collar job skip it, this book is not meant for you. Only wealthy types with spiritual pretensions need apply, since this book is partly derived from seminars he gives around the country based on similar topics for corporate clients. <br />He also skipped on the psychopathology of wealth and money obsession. Why are so many of the new wealthy class, anti-charity and greedy to the point of amoral? Witness the fraud on Wall Street, how money corrupted our democracy, Dot com swindles or the S&L scandals. He's seems to ignore the corrosive effect money has on people also or why it's worshipped so much in our society. Money counts not character or essence. <br />...	2002-07-16

Gore Vidal exposes the hypocrisy and the blatant amorality of the federal government and it's foreign and domestic policies.<br />Unlike many rah rah conservative writers who don't question or look too deeply into government policies, Gore does. What he finds is not pretty nor does he let idealogy blind him to what has and is occuring in this country.<br />This book should be required reading for anyone who feels something is wrong in the way the country is headed. Unlike some ultra-liberal gas  bags whose writings are ponderous or certain conservative talking heads whose lack of intellect is shown in their writings, Gore is a delight to read, he has a terrific acerbic wit and is not afraid to use it. In short a modern day Twain.<br />In my opinion the best part is his dialog with McVeigh. This is worth the price of the book alone. All I can say is read it! It will suprise, anger, and inform you.<br />The only fault is the chronological layout of the book. The pub. should have corrected this.

It is an distillation of ancient spiritual psychologies as applied to todays world and needs. Helminski draws deeply from the Gurdjieff 4th Way traditon, Zen and Sufism. But mostly the 4th Way - if you've read In Search of the Miraculous, Views from the Real World you'll see the parallels.<br />The insights into the human condition and what needs to be done about it are excellent and is a very good primer into spiritual psychologies. They apply across religous boundries and would be of great use to anyone who is contemplating pursuing an spiritual path. Especially the western religious traditons were the concept of an spiritual psychology is all but lost or not understood.<br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it is an primer and not an how to book. Though any decent book on Vipassana style meditation will help here - which really forms the foundation for what Helminski is talking about in the book.	2002-02-28

As stated by Huston Smith in the intro in the book is political/polemical in nature. It is not a text on awakening, being or dealing with spiritual psychology per se. Nor does it have anything really to do with following in the footsteps of Emerson or Thoreau. Perry merely quotes them because of name recognition. Emerson and Thoreau would have been aghast to be associated with such an antedeluvian like Perry.<br /> What Perry attempts to cover he does well and flows from one topic to another smoothly. Style wise at times his writing reminds me of Schuon's - he has a penchant for being a obscurantist. In essence this work is a political meta-commentary on spirituality as found in Hinduism, Buddhism with a smattering of Islam and Neo-Platonic Christianity(as defined by Erigena not as understood by either the Catholic or Eastern Churches) and Taoism thrown in for good measure. He also tries to find common ground between them all and make the case that they are all talking about the same thing. In addition he tackles modernity and societal issues and lays out the problems as he sees it.<br />Problems:<br />Being a Perennialist Perry considers Judaism and Christianity as inferior spiritual paths and promotes Hinduism and Budhhism as superior ones. (Perennialists are generally followers of Sufism and Hinduism or Buddhism as Perennialism implicitly repudiates strict monotheism as understood by Jews and Christians). So if you are a Christian you will be offended by this book.<br />The book is also marred by Perry's fundamentalist beliefs about society . Perry attacks democracy, human rights as being untraditional and degenerate, churches for being active on social issues and especially Vatican II.(Vatican II is a favorite bugbear of Traditionalists along with Jung). Essentially anything post-reformation is bad. Engaging in historical revisionism and elitism he defends and even supports aristocracy and the divine right of kings as the best form of government! He claims that it is divinely ordained and uses scripture from various wisdom traditions to justify it. He even justifies Attila the Hun and Ghengis Khan as the wrath of god.<br />There is more than a bit of Manichean world hating stream of thought in his work. For him there is only the via negativa, the path of dealing with the pain of existence in order to gain release from life. There is no via positiva, the path of celebration and thanksgiving, no via creativa, the path of human creativity, no via transformativa, the path of creation renewed and mended. A truly hateful view life and creation to say the least.<br />His criticism of modernity is third rate(as he is Muslim living in Egypt). Writers like Lewis Mumford, Ellul, Theodore Roszak and Philip Sherrard have penned far better and thought out works than this one. <br />In Closing:<br />This book may have value for you if believe that inquistions, reducing women to chattel, theological fanaticism and priest kings are good for the world. Otherwise skip it as it is one of the most odious books written since Ayn Rands Atlas Shrugged or Mein Kampf. <br />Skip it and get Hossein Nasr's Knowledge of the Sacred. Nasr actually knows what he writes about and neither does he insult the reader.	2001-09-18

Overall Bair does a fine job at describing how to practice heart beat meditation(HBM), the book is well layed out and gives a step by step sequence. The method is flexible enough that you can adapt it for you own needs. Play with it and take the parts which suit you best. In my case it help me flesh out the Hesychastic Prayer of the Heart as found in the Orthodox Church. You can even go to his web site (do a google search)and download the fundamentals of HBM to try it out before buying the book. <br />However I do have some gripes, the first being that Bair pushes HBM as a psychological panacea and hence comes off as some New Age Tony Robbins with all the testimonials. He also makes curative claims that are not substantiated by any research. Personally I find this a turn off as there are psychological problems that need a psychotherapist not a meditation practice to correct. But thats just me.<br />The other gripe the breathing sequence in HBM involves prolonged breath retention -- a powerful but potentially dangerous yogic practice which is usually taught to yoga students who have practiced for some years. It generally has a energizing effect so if you are excitable or want to relax you may wish to alter the sequence. So please be careful with this aspect.<br />Overall it's a fine addition to any meditators bookshelf. Puran is not overly preachy or other worldly. He's down to earth in his presentation. I don't think you can go wrong with it.<br />Other books worth I believe complement it are:<BR>The Knowing Heart by Kabir Helminski<BR>Heart Self and Soul by Robert Frager	2001-09-16

Eruigena was deeply influenced by Neoplatonic thought and it shows in this work. Bamford does a fine job of translating it and does Eruigena's homliy justice. His prose is first rate and is a joy to read.<br />The book can be divided into roughly two sections. The Homily itself which constitutes about 50 pages and the rest is Bamford's take of it, which is roughly 250 pages. Bamford's hermenutics of the Homily can be skipped - it really tells the reader more about Bamford's thinking than anything else.<br />I must take issue with Bamford's misleading advertising he used to market his book. Like the previous reviewer I am in agreement that this work has nothing to do with Celtic Christianity unless one would equate it Greek thought. Rest assured they are not the same thing. In a sense Bamford does an injustice to both neoplatonism and Celtic Chrisitanity by doing this.<br />Ratings wise it gets 3 Stars.  5 stars for the Homily itself.  -2 stars for misleading advertising and marketing Neoplatonic writings as a work of Celtic Christianity.	2001-07-14

He shows how the west via the divorce of science from spirit has wrecked havoc on our planet. And also how the Christian faith helped accelerate this process when it removed elements of its metaphysical doctrines that kept nature as a part of the divine. In addition he elucidates how some of the philosophical schools of thought help widen the schism between man, nature and the divine. He closes with a chapter what can be done to correct the problem via the resacralization of nature as a reflection of the Creator. <br />Seyyed Nasr main thrust in correcting Christianity's loss of sapiential wisdom or gnosis is to turn to the eastern traditions like Tantra or Taoist alchemy. However considering the animosity that mainstream churches have towards the other spiritual traditions this is not likely to occur for a number of reasons.<BR>1) The Christians who've adopted other methods are considered marginal at best, heretics at worst. Just try promoting yoga at your local highschool and see what happens. A current example would be Thomas Merton. He came closet to what Seyyed Nasr is asking. Still to many Christians he is considered an apostate.<BR>2) Christianity in many instances has been reduced to down to after life fire insurance policy and God being a banker and greengrocer to the elect. Just get 'saved' and thats it.<BR>3) Christian intellectual tradition is so bad nowadays as to be non-existent. So bad it took a devout Moslem to write about what should have been obvious to any Christian leader with a functioning brain.<BR>4)To recreate a gnosis within Christianity it would take man whose a \\"finished student\\" of say Tantra and had the intellectual capacity and church authority to integrate these teachings in a seemless manner. Plus establish a living transimission. No small task. <br />What I even more amazing is that this book was first written in 1967 and is better than most of the recent writings on this problem including: Ken Wilbers Sense and Soul and Robert Ornstein's 'The AxeMakers Gift\\".<br />Overall it is a very informative and a easy read that one can keep comming back to and learning something new. <br />If you like E.F. Schumacher, Huston Smith, Gregory Bateson, Jacob Needleman, you will enjoy this book. I would also include anyone who is concerned about what is happening in the world via the loss of faith, runaway technology and destruction of the planet we live upon. <br />BTW the references section is a excellent starting point for further research.	2000-04-07

The book is a brief but decent historical overview of technology and its negative effect on the world. They don't really state anything new in this area that has not been covered in more detail by other writers.<br />If you  are new to this topic the book is a fine place to start. However if you  have been keeping up with whats going on and the possible solutions you  won't find anything new or useful here. Also if you are looking for what  you can do locally in your community or society as a whole there is nothing  for you.<br />The only problem I have with the book is their solution to the  problem which is even more technology! Like most tech enthusiats they are  incapable of seeing the side-effects of implementing new technology on  society. Evidently they have fogotten Eistein's famous quote on this:  &quot;You cannot solve a problem with the same thinking that created the  problem to begin with.&quot;<br />Also their coverage of the internet and  computers is pretty simplistic at best.

He also does a decent job on explaining the psychological aspects of mysticism, something that is usually missing from most works in Christian mysticism. However if you are looking for a how-to book this is not it. Though I must quibble with the way he defines metaonia ie., \\"change of mind\\" as something else.<br />*One big gripe though* I would have given it 5 stars if the author was not so insistant in reminding the reader Gurdjieff's teaching were from taken from the Greek Orthodox tradition. They weren't. Get \\"In Search of the Miraculous\\" and a volume of the Philokalia and compare them. The differences are obvious in aim, method and teaching. It is well documented that the bulk of Gurdjieff's teachings derived from his time spent with the Sufis, along with the Buddhists and yogis. He reformulated them to reach Europeans who were soaked in existenialism like Ouspensky and Nicoll. In fact the the mystical teachings of the Orthodox Church are aimed at monks not householders or married folks. Just read the Philokalia or the writings of St. Theophan the Recluse that Amis uses to support his this. The  writings of St. Theophan are not aimed at laity, in fact if a modern person followed them they'd lose their sanity. Gurdjeiff even on his death bed advised his students to travel to the far east not Mt. Athos. Even though Amis claims otherwise he presents no proof of it. Though one can truthfully state that G. was well schooled on Orthodox theology he never claimed that it presented a complete spiritual path. An example would be G's concept of us as a \\"three brained being\\" is clearly Sufic not Christian.<br />Amis also raises the idea that a secret brotherhood in Eastern Christianity kept alive esoteric teachings is betrayed by the fact that he has no evidence for them nor does the Orthodox condone it.<br />To me Amis does a disservice to himself and to the reader by making up a fake history to support his claim that the Fourth Way is inner Christianity. The Church would consider G's teaching a heresy at the very least. Though it can be used as such as it would form the \\"how to\\" part of Christianity. The Orthodox maintain that Eastern Christianity is perfect and needs no occult practices.<br />I'd also recommend the following books which can help with the how-to aspects of what Amis is writing about.<br />The Mystical Theology of the Orthodox Church - Vladimir Lossky<br />Living the Mindful life - by Charles Tart<br />Living Presence - Edmund Helminskinor does the Orthodox condone it.<br />To me Amis does a disservice to himself and to the reader by making up a fake history to support his claim that the Fourth Way is inner Christianity.

However Scott's fails in the attempt to make the case.<br />It's easy  to see and create patterns which connect supposedly diverse ideas and  actions. It's another thing to prove that there is a legitimate connection.  And therein lies the problem with this book.<br />Scott's fault lies in his  approach of relying extensively on literary works of dubious merit such as  &quot;The Dawn of Magic&quot; whose authors mix delusions with theosopy. Of  making connections where there are none and lastly of not checking his  assertions with other sources.<br />One example is the claim the Judo was  'leaked' by the ascended masters of India to the common populace. Which is  complete non-sense to anyone who has studied martial-art history.<br />Another is the claim that William Blake was deeply influenced by the  Kabbalah. Which is wrong, it was Swendenborg among others.<br />In other  cases he asserts links where there are none and offers no references to  back them up.  Especially when it comes to the history of Sufism to prove  it predated Islam. Like Shah, Scott fails to tell the readership there is  no documented history of Sufism before the comming of Islam. Though he  makes one up by asserting the certain people like Plato, Solon and the  ancient Egyptian priests were Sufis! Historical revisionism at its  best.<br />In the last portion he runs out of things to write and fills up the  remainder of the book with a commentary on &quot;The Canitcle of  Liebowitz&quot; a sci-fi story and tries somehow to tie it in with Shahs  Sufism.<br />Save your money. If you must read it borrow it from the library  or something.	2000-03-01

This book provides a dated and suspicously incomplete overview of some so-called secret societies. One howler is that he considers the Tibetan Buddhists a secret  society! - they never were but until the earlier 1900's certainly  inaccessible to most foreigners. I guess Shah thought that his audience was  too stupid to figure this one out. Another is the so-called Illuminati he  makes a connection with Bayazid Ansari's atheistic cult of libertines and  bandits with Adam Weishaupt group. However he provides no references to  back up this claim.<br />Overall this book is a ok place to start with secret  societies - but PLEASE take what the author says with a grain of salt. Shah  has a history of playing it fast and loose with facts in order to support  his many claims like being the Grand Shiekh of all Sufis and which is not  recognized by any Sufi orders - Naqshbandi, Mevlevi, etc,	2000-02-17

But does it live up to it's name? No. It is a  complete fabrication whose main goal is to lure 4th Way students away from  various 'groups' and into Shah's version of Sufism. It comes across at  times as commericial for Shah and does not really deal with G or his  teachings in informative manner.  In fact most of what is written about G  in this book contradicts publicly availible information on him and his  teachings.<br /> Remember this book was originally written during the period  when Shah was recruiting 4th Way people during the mid 1960's.<br />On the  plus side though the story does contain information on the pitfalls of  approaching so-called 'esoteric teachings' with your everyday kind of  thinking.  How we in the west end up treating a SpiritualTeacher like some  esoteric vending machine because of our consumeristic mentality. Of  confusing your wants with what you need and mistaking the container with  the content. Though it does not outweigh the negatives and such information  can be found in his other books like &quot;Learning how to Learn.&quot;<br />  Shah had a great opportunity to clear away the mystique surrounding the  origins of G's teachings and instead under a pen name writes a self-serving  piece to recruit students. As such I cannot recommend this book.<br />Kathleen  Speath's book &quot;The Gurdjieff Work' has IMO a much more honest  appraisal and informative  of the man and his legacy and would appeal to  anyone interested in the subject.<br />Like the last reviewer I too have read  many of Shah's books but after reading this one I no longer have much  respect for the man.	2000-02-11

Evidently the authors were too lazy to rewrite it for a general audience. The contents is even worse the author had decided to mix a little  christianity, pop-psychology, A Course in Miracles, Buddhism and Taoism  together. The mix is a disaster. The so-called exercises range from 'lets  stare into each other eyes meaningfully' to so some bizarre two person  exercises that don't have anything to do with spirituality or for that  matter anything else. But considering that the author has no background or  training in any spiritual path it does not come as suprise.<br />What he did  was to read some books on the subject and then offer seminars on  spirituality. <br />There's a lot words I would call a man who writes garbage  like this but they are not suitable for family viewing. Suffice to say that  he gives spirituality a bad name.<br />If you like Shirely McClaines work or  the Mutant Message Downunder you might like this book.<br />Much better books  writter by people who actually practice what they teach would  be:<br />Essential Spirituality - Roger Walsh<br />Awakening the Buddha Within -  Lama Surya Das<br />Creating Spirituality from Scratch - by the above	1999-12-27
