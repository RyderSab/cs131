The authors purport to write about what the existence of zoos means about humans. That would be a wonderful and important thing for them to write about, but they are so narcissistic and so anthropocentric that most of the book is meaningless at best, and more to the point promotes the sort of mindset that inevitably leads to the imprisonment and extirpation of nonhuman animals. The authors actually argue AGAINST giving these caged animals larger cages (while not, unfortunately, arguing against caging them at all), by saying that because the creatures generally stay in one part of the cage, they don't NEED a larger territory, and, incredibly, cite that if you lock someone in an office over a weekend with lots of pencils and books that they might not get bored. I'm sure you can see the fallacies: these creatures are not locked in zoos for the weekend, and I dare say that just because the authors spend most of their time in their little offices that they would not want to be locked in there forever. Their argument against this? That we must not \\"project\\" onto (nonhuman) animals the dissatisfaction we would feel if we were so caged. But the authors miss the point entirely: we don't need to \\"project\\" this dissatisfaction: we can merely observe that zoos drive animals insane. But the authors are more interested in their own theories and in maintaining their own perception of humans as separate from and superior to other beings than they are in recognizing the independent and willful existence of these others, or indeed, recognizing that they exist at all. <br />I could cite dozens of examples, but I'll just do one more, which is even more obscene. The authors ask why wildlife should be preserved, and then answer their own question in a way that makes their arrogance and stupidity especially clear: \\"Our answer is that the human world would be impoverished, for animals are preserved solely for human benefit, because human beings have decided they want them to exist for human pleasure. The notion that they are preserved for their sakes is a peculiar one, for it implies that animals might wish a certain condition to endure. It is, however, nonsensical for humans to imagine that animals might want to continue the existence of their species.\\" <br />This book is a prime example of the narcissismm, stupidity, and arrogance that is causing industrial civilization to kill the planet. It's a horrid, horrid book.	2004-11-03

It is I think Fromms best and most important book. This is the book that first let me know that the violence of the dominant culture is not biological in its origin. <br />The book is centered around the question, obviously, of why humans commit atrocities. Fromm begins this book by exploring many of the theories, such as the notion that we are biologically overdetermined to be so violent. But he conclusively shows that cannot be the case. He then gives examples of nonviolent cultures, and explores why these cultures are the way they are. He then concludes with a powerful and detailed exploration of Hitler, showing how Hitler manifests the essence of this awful civilization that is killing the planet. A powerful book that helped form the foundations of my thinking.	2003-09-02

It's an overview of the bees of the world, with good no nonsense information about miners, masons, carpenters, and so on as well as the more social bees. I especially loved their effective use of diagrams for the shapes of various bees' nests.<br />The thing I didn't like was their intrusive and oftentimes nonsensical (and certainly slavish) adherence to the nonsensical notion that the natural world is based on strict competition. They bend over backwards to try to show that the activities of all bees are based on competition, and they strain to use crazy metaphors to support this view. Instead of perceiving bees and flowers as a wonderful example of the way that different members of natural communities work together for the benefit of the larger community, they actually resort to citing Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations as bee/plant interactions being a form of selfish capitalism!!![.] It's nonsense. <br />One other problem, and this is one reason I hate science. I'll just give a quote. Speaking of a bee being driven to extinction by logging, they say, \\"Recent reports of forestry activities on Bacan give rise to concern that the bee might become extinct before yielding up the secrets of its biology.\\" If the authors weren't \\"free market scientists\\" they would be ashamed of this statement. It implies: Who cares if the creature goes extinct for its own sake? We just need to mine the knowledge before it does.<br />Once again, all this said, the book does provide some good information.	2003-06-29

The authors thoroughly and rigorously examine the scientific evidence showing that traumatic memories are indeed often forgotten. They also show, at great length, the many logical holes in the arguments of many of the proponents of the so-called &quot;false memory&quot; position. <br />Yet the book's great strength--its thoroughness--is also its weakness. Presumably because so much of this so-called debate so clearly disregards scientific evidence, the authors go to exhaustive lengths to show the scientific evidence for amnesia of these memories. That's a wonderful and important thing to do. But it also doesn't always make for the most exciting reading. Thus the one-star reduction: in their desire to make sure that every angle is covered from any possible attack, the authors end up repeating themselves a fair amount. The book (weighing in at more than 650 pages of text) could probably have been cut to about 450 pages without losing anything. Then it would certainly have been a five star book.	2003-03-17

I can't believe only two people have reviewed this extraordinary and extraordinarily beautiful book. It is one of the most important books I've ever read. Using the words of scientific philosophers themselves (but putting them into a beautifully-written, poetic context) Susan Griffin brilliantly shows how the logic of science is fundamentally anti-life, and anti-woman.

It has the best first sentence of any book I've ever read: \\"Civilization originates in conquest abroad and repression at home.\\" And the book takes off from there. It is an extraordinary exploration of the indigenous peoples with whom Diamond worked, and explores the differences between, for example, indigenous and civilized moralities. Here is what he wrote about morality in a civilized world: Our moral syntax has no predicate.  Hence we speak of doing good, good for its own sake, or evil.   We convert each to a pure substantive, beyond experience, abstract.  That is what [anthropologist] Paul Radin meant when he observed that the subject (or object) to which love, remorse, sorrow, may be directed is regarded as secondary in our civilization.  All have the rank of virtues as such: they are manifestations of Gods if not of Mans way.  But among primitives . . . the converse holds.  Morality is behavior, values are not detached, not substantives; the good, the true, the beautiful or rather, the ideas of these things, do not exist.  Therefore, one does not fall in love, one loves another; and that is an intricately learned experience, as hate, in a certain sense, also is.<br />The whole book is that good. Fabulous. Fabulous.	2002-12-30

But I got something else from this book as well. I read this that Forbes is saying that one of the reasons civilization is killing the planet is because of a spiritual illness with a physical vector. If I get the flu and then cough all over you, you might then get the flu, with all of its symptoms. If I have the cannibal sickness and I cough (or somehow otherwise transfer the disease to you) you will have to consume the souls of others in order to survive. You will become a vampire. Or to putthis another way, you will become a conquistador, a pornographer, a slaver, a businessman. I read this not only as a metaphor, but as a possible description of how things really are. And he makes a very convincing case. Wonderful and important book by a very wise man.	2002-12-11

But I found myself routinely cursing at the author's hypocrisy. When the United States, England, France, or any other empire invades some country to make certain that American or European oil transnationals have access to that nation's oil, the actions of these empires are seen as rational, normal, expected. These empires are seen as acting in their national interest. Yet if any country attempts to keep them out, they are seen as \\"greedy,\\" \\"rapacious,\\" and their leaders are seen as silly or foolish or dangerous (many of Yergin's characterizations of third world leaders are shockingly racist). When the US wants to use any and all means to gain access to oil from the Middle East, well, that's \\"defending\\" national interest.  When the Soviet Union wanted to do the same, well, that was \\"Soviet aggression.\\" (And I'm not suggesting that Soviet aggression would have been any better than US aggression, but merely pointing out the obvious double standard.) He consistently trivializes those of the third world who oppose the despoliation of their land and the theft of their resources. He also consistently trivializes or ignores the massive environmental destruction and social dislocation caused by the oil economy. In search of an informative history, I found a propaganda tract for the oil industry and for the nations that provide the muscle for them.	2002-10-19

I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.  But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry.  The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded.  What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough.	2002-10-19

Quinn continues to amaze me with the quality of his thought and his continual creativity at coming at the problem of the destructiveness of civilization in new ways.  In this book, time is running backwards, and so the air is becoming cleaner as factories convert pollution back into natural materials, oil is pumped back into the ground, and so on.  On a personal scale, characters live backwards, too, growing young and eventually rejoining with their mothers.  All relationships run backwards.  It's an extraordinary way to get us to look at our relationships to each other, and to the planet.  And it's a damn good book.  I cared deeply about the characters, and kept turning pages to find out what happened to them.  Then when I finished the book, I immediately went back to the beginning.

The fundamental question is: is violence ever an acceptable tool to help bring about social change?  This is probably the most important question of our time, yet so often discussions around it fall into cliche and magical thinking: that somehow if we are merely good enough and nice enough people the state will stop using its violence to exploit us all.  In this book the authors go through all of the arguments used by pacifists, and shoot them down, using tremendous scholarship and logic.  Gandhi is often given as an example of a pacifist achieving his goal, but Gandhi's success comes at the end of a hundred year struggle--often violent--for independence by the Indians.  How far could Martin Luther King Jr have gone were it not for the African-Americans taking to the streets?  The authors don't, of course, argue for blind, unthinking violence, they merely argue against blind, unthinking nonviolence.  A desperately important book	2001-07-31

His writing is elegant, his language precise.  And the distinctions he makes throughout the book, differentiating between types of violence, for example, are vital and sharp.  There is much that I loved about this book. The two crucial flaws I see, and these are all the worse considering his precision elsewhere, are a very dangerous anthropocentrism and a just as dangerous ethnocentrism.  So far as the former, he consistently speaks of the Jews and others in the camps being treated as &quot;animals.&quot;  He doesn't see the irony of having been labeled a subhuman, and thus one who may be (according to the master race) slaughtered, and then using &quot;animals&quot; as a pejorative.  Given that our culture is killing the planet because we perceive all nonhumans as &quot;subhumans,&quot; this blindness on his part is dangerous.  I probably could have forgiven him this had it been alone, but his ethnocentrism was really appalling.  He consistently paints the Holocaust as Unique with a capital U, somehow underplaying the at least one hundred million Africans killed in the slave trade, the tens of millions of indigenous peoples killed in North America, the indigenous peoples being killed today because they're in the way of the &quot;lebensraum&quot; our culture wants, in fact the genocide that characterizes industrial civlization (for a thorough exploration of this, see anything by Ward Churchill, Lewis Mumford's Myth of the Machine, or Zygmunt Bauman's Modernity and the Holocaust).  He mentions these other genocides, and seems to give them their due, but then a page later will somehow elevate the Holocaust above them.  The ethnocentricity manifests in other ways, too.  For example, he talks about how shameful it was to be stripped naked when they first arrived at the camps.  He paints this picture vividly and horrifyingly.  He should have stopped there, because in his analysis he says things like &quot;Anyone who doesnot have [clothes] no longer perceives himself as a human being but rather as a worm: naked, slow, ignoble, prone on the ground.&quot;  Well, no.  Many cultures of indigenous peoples have had traditions where clothes meant little.  His categorization would seem to include these indigenous peoples as &quot;worms,&quot; or, once again, subhumans.  If you can overlook these deep flaws, you can still learn much from this beautifully-written book.	2001-07-27

His line-by-line writing is powerful, clear, and compelling.  He knows when to start a scene, and when to drop it to move to another.  His characters are interesting.  And he draws powerful pictures of a dystopian future of corporate control of the world, people more interested in virtual reality than the increasingly-devastated world that surrounds them, and a deep alienation and sorrow.  BUT, and this is a huge but, his plots always seem flat to me.  This has been true of the other books of his I've read, and it's certainly true of this one. There never seems enough at stake for the main characters, emotionally, philosophically, or physically.  His words suck me in, and his plots spit me back out.

But Todorov's thinking is fuzzy in the extreme, moving from cliche to nonsense.  There are many extremely good books that cover the same material.  The Nazi Doctors, by Robert Jay Lifton is infinitely better, as are The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness by Erich Fromm, Treblinka by Jean-Francois Steiner, and Modernity and the Holocaust by Zygmunt Bauman.  The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is that the original quotes by concentration camp survivors that he sprinkles liberally throughout the text are extremely interesting.  The quotes themselves give insight.  Too bad the analysis doesn't match the subject.	2001-07-07

She describes clearly and compellingly how the dominant culture destroys the hearts of other cultures while cannibalizing them aesthetically.  Thus we kill indigenous cultures and hang dream catchers from our rear view mirrors.  Thus we consider ourselves sophisticated because we eat at ethnic restaurants and at the same time we do not seem to mind that the real cultures of Ethiopia, India, Mexico, are destroyed, turned into cheap imitations of mainstream capitalism.  She details this process.  It is an extraordinary book.	2001-07-04

Stauber and Rampton lay bare, in clear, easily-readable prose, the ways that corporations destroy democracy by hiring scientists and other experts to promote &quot;research&quot; that has as its function confusing the public.  The book is meticulously footnoted.  Following back some of these sources reveals that the scholarship is as great as the analysis.  Their writing style is engaging, and at times even humorous.  I highly recommend this book.  If we are ever to reclaim our democracy from corporations, it will be in great measure because of books like this one.	2001-07-03

It is easy to become cynical when we are lied to so often.  Cigarettes aren't bad for us, we're told.  Global warming isn't happening, timber companies don't deforest.  But in this clearsighted and important book, Stauber and Rampton show readers how to spot even the more subtle corporate manipulations.  This book is essential reading if we are ever to gain anything resembling democracy in this country, that is, if the citizens are ever to demand a government that cares more for the rights of living human beings than it does for the rights of corporations.  Thank you, Stauber and Rampton.	2001-06-26

And this is Quinn's best book.  I read it in one sitting, and for the last thirty pages I couldn't stop crying, even though I was on a crowded airplane.  It's an extraordinary, and extraordinarily moving, book.	2001-01-29

Lori Berenson, in Peru because she cares about the poor, was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.  If Lori were a CEO wanted because she had poisoned the landscape, the United States government would have shielded her from this fate.  Witness Warren Anderson, CEO of Union Carbide, sentenced to death in absentia in India for his role in the Bhopal disaster that killed tens of thousands: the United States shields him.  But Lori's fate, heartwrenchingly described in this fastreading book, has been vastly different, as has the response of the US government.  We can only hope that this book will help to improve Lori's conditions, or even set her free.  If any book can do that, this one can.	2001-01-17

The best history I've ever read	Eduardo Galeano may be the world's best living writer and thinker, and Century of the Wind may be his best book.  I've not yet read his newest.  But this is an extraordinary history of the western hemisphere in the 20th century, told vignette by vignette.  Each paragraph is a story of its own, but they form into a moving collage that will change forever how you view the world around you.	2000-12-12

In my late twenties I thought I was going insane because so much around me made so little sense: we're destroying the planet  yet people continue with their lives as though nothing is wrong.  And then  I read The Natural Alien, and I realized that it's the culture that is  crazy, not me.  This book helped me to see how the insane and destructive  actions of our culture spring from how we perceive the world, and revealed  the hidden assumptions that guide the destructiveness.  I will be forever  in debt to Neil Evernden for writing this extraordinary book.	2000-05-07

He lays bare the presumptions that are guiding our culture to destroy the planet, with beautiful writing that is  clear when it needs to be and obscure when that best serves.  A truly  remarkable book.  My own perception of the ending was different than one  other reviewer who thought it was the weakest point of the book:  for me it  was the strongest.  I read it lying on the grass in the middle of a public  park so crowded people were stepping over the top of me, yet I was so moved  I could not stop crying.  Amazing book.	2000-05-07
