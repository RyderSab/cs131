US	33993847	R31ASDTZD51LSW	0312332068	32293710	Evan Blessed	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Very enjoyable.	Evan is a well-drawn character who has a good relationship with his superior.  He follows the clues and his instincts, while realizing the impact of crime on the victim, those around them and the perpetrator.  This is a very enjoyable series that has, particularly with this book, gone from being cozy to traditional mystery.  There is still humor and light moments, but the mystery has more focus and is more interesting. I enjoyed book, and liked the ending.	2005-10-13

As much as I enjoyed Arsenault's first book \\"Spked!,\\"  this was even better as there wasn't a slow spot in it.  Eddie is a wonderful protagonist, realistic, and introspective. He loves his coffee and cat, General VonKatz.  There are interesting secondary characters in Detective Orr, brother Henry and his wife Bobbie.  The book's sense of place, dialogue, suspense and pacing all contribute to capturing and keeping the reader turning the pages.  If you've not yet read Arsenault, do.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.	2005-10-09

I am a huge fan of Ms. Roberts work and applaud her moving more into stories where the emphasis is more on the mystery than the romance.  This was a well-crafted story, beginning when Reena is young and traveling through experiences in her life to present day.  The excellent characters, relationships, dialogue and sense of place, along with the romance and intimate scenes that are the hallmark of Robert's writing are all here.  The only problem I had was that you know the villain from the beginning, so it does diminish the element of suspense.  Still, it is understandable that Reena doesn't put it together until the end and the final scenes bring the suspense into the story.  There is graphic violence and profanity, but it's realistic and clear that Roberts did her research on fires.  Roberts is an excellent writer who has a permanent place on my \\"must buy\\" list.	2005-10-08

Pawel is an excellent writer and has created an interesting, intelligent and complex character in Tejada.  On one hand, he will use force if he feels it is \\"necessary,\\" and yet he is a good man caught in a time of political loyalties.  They story is not as gripping as \\"Death of a Nationalist,\\" which I highly recommend and would read first, but is more of a mystery and suspense set during a time of political turmoil.  I was completely caught up by the story and found it a straight-through, four-hour read.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-03

Mac is one of my favorite characters; he's likable, loyal, ethical, and conscious of the price of violence, and there is violence.  The story is tight, suspenseful, has great dialogue and grabs you from page one.  Simply put, Housewright is a excellent writer who has created a great series.  Start at the beginning and enjoy.	2005-10-03

The plot would have done better with fewer characters and less mixing of Ike's past and present; hopefully, we'll have moved past that in the next book.  Ike is an interesting character, if a tad too perfect, but that's being picky.  Ruth, the president of the local college is very well drawn.  The story doesn't quite know whether it's focus is the art theft or spies, which dilutes the effectiveness of both.  Still, it is interesting, suspenseful, and progresses well.  I can't say it was great, but it was good enough that I'll read the next.	2005-10-02

I discovered Templeton with her current book \\"Cold in the Earth\\" and promptly ordered as much of her backlist as I could find.  It was so worth it!  She is a wonderfully atmospheric writer.  In this, you feel the inclusiveness of the village and the frustration of Helena.  But it's the way in which this story is told I particularly liked.  The first \\"book\\" is Helena returning from prison and trying to adjust.  The second \\"book\\" takes us back to her first marriage; moving to the village and up through her trial.  The final \\"book\\" is the solving of the crimes.  I was so engrossed in the story; I didn't suspect the villain until late.  I highly recommend this book and this author.	2005-10-02

The book moved quickly and sense of place was excellent.  However, I never really had a sense of Eve's character and even less for the supporting characters.  She's tough, she's capable of taking care of herself, lots of people die around her, but I wasn't involved enough to really care.  So, while I thought it was good, it was far from great.	2005-10-01

I particularly liked that McRae wasn't an angst-ridden, alcohol-driven character--although McRae did his fair share of imbibing-whose relationship to his fellow officers and superiors is realistic.  The subject matter is difficult; anytime children are involved, it's hard to read.  The story was well plotted, with interesting twists and turns and good suspense.  I even enjoyed the bit of a nod to Ian Rankin.  Altogether, I enjoyed it and look forward to the next MacBride.	2005-10-01

The character of Brunetti, his friends and family, and even some of the suspects were the strength of this novel.<br /><br />Along with this was Venetian Brunetti's view of his Venice, which I appreciated.  The mystery itself was interesting, although without suspense.  The outcome was certainly a bit different, but worked for me.  I very much enjoyed this book and will read more of the series.	2005-09-29

Knight creates a picture of 12th century England and explaining the system of justice without bogging down the story.  I found myself caught up in the characters of Sir John, his uncomfortable relationship with his wife and brother-in-law, loyal bodyguard and somewhat weak, but dogged, clerk.  These are characters I should like to follow further.  Happily, there are more books to this series for me to enjoy.  I certainly recommend this those who like to combine their history and mystery.	2005-09-26

Where this book fell short was it's predictability-it was too easy to tell where it was gong before it got there.  Still it kept me turning the pages and, at the very last page, wondering what's going to happen to Jack and Herb next.  Even through it wasn't as good as the first book, Whiskey Sour, I shall definitely read the next one.	2005-09-25

The first of this series, \\"Full Dark House,\\" was very good and this was even better.  My only two regrets are that (1) the characters are of an age where you wonder how long they can be around and (2) I wish there were more books already there for me to read.  But I know the next book is due out soon, so I'll take heart.  The relationship and dialogue between the two detectives is priceless, and there are great supporting characters.  The writing is wonderful-it's funny, suspenseful and educational, and, as with fine wine, should be savored but thoroughly enjoyed.  Very highly recommended.	2005-09-17

The plot was good and there were enough suspects to keep me going, but the motive was a little weak.  What I really liked about the book was the characters.  There are a lot of them, but each was unique and interesting in their own right and I really liked the relationships between the characters.  I can only hope this is the beginning of a series as I should really like to see how these characters develop over time.	2005-09-14

The cover blurb by Donna Andrews describes the book as \\"a modern day Nick and Nora Charles,\\" and I'd say she's not far off.  The characters are part of the upscale, San Francisco, theatre, cocktail set, but it's the self-deprecating, first person voice that gives the story balance and humor.  All of the supporting characters are wonderful, particularly Flank.  It's a quick, fun read that is cozy with a bit of romance, but also an entertaining break for those of us who usually prefer something darker.  I'll be looking forward to Charley and Jack's next adventure.	2005-09-12

Whenever I need a break from mystery, I go to fantasy and this is a series I love.  The gang is back; Holly Short, Foaly the centaur, and Mulch Duggums.  The writing is clever as is the story, and I loved the ending.  It doesn't matter whether you're 7 or 70, if you enjoy fantasy, you'll enjoy Artemis; but do start with the first book.

It was a little slow and I became bored with Ophelia until the end, and more time was spent on her angst and the rather annoying attention of Richard, than the mystery.  Abby and Darci, the assistant librarian, were the more interesting characters, but they were in a supporting role.  I was disappointed with the use of magic in the conclusion.  It's a quick read, but I would hope for much more from the next book.	2005-09-11

Allyn is a wonderful writer who knows how to create interesting characters you'd like to know, a sense of place you'd like to visit, dialogue you can hear and a plot in which you become involved.  I particularly appreciate that he doesn't fall into the stereotypical small-town police chief, and included a well-done twist at the end.  I will admit that this book was not quite as good as \\"Icewater Mansions,\\" the first in the Mitch Mitchell series, but that's being really picky.	2005-09-09

The only thing that makes this book, and the first one, work and at all readable is the skill of the writer, and that's saying a lot.  Dexter is a fascinating character, although I do get a bit tired of being continually reminded that he's not normal.  There were some humorous scenes, which are skillfully included to make the other portions less horrific.  However, this book was not as well done as the first; there were serious flaws with the plot and the ending was too predictable.  Still, while I hope Mr. Lindsay's editor takes a stronger hand with his next book, I shall be waiting for it with a degree of guilt and morbid curiosity.	2005-09-08

She has created a wonderful character in \\"Paddy,\\" who, in spite of her repressive upbringing and poor self-image, is smart, ambitious and determined.  The story does have good suspense, but not until late in the story.  The story of the real Paddy was interesting but I think the book would have been tighter and better without it.  The book is good, but could have been much better.	2005-09-06

The premise seemed less \\"Di Vinci Code\\" and more \\"The Eight,\\" but this book was no where near either. The hook of the artifacts was never realized in the story, and I found myself skimming huge sections trying to find out the point of it all.  Unfortunately, there never really was one.  Worst of all, not only did the protagonist not grow with the story, but he regressed.  I basically couldn't wait for the book to end, even with it's very disappointing ending, so I could get on to something else.  I'd say to give this one a miss.	2005-09-05

I loved the writing and that the story is told from the perspective of the different characters.  The characters are well done and even have personal lives.  The case unfolds in layers, each increasing my interest and involvement.  I didn't identify the killer--although looking back, I should have-but loved the final resolution.  I really enjoyed this book.	2005-09-03

Marsh takes her reader along not letting one know the \\"how\\" and \\"who\\" under the last few pages.  It's the beginning of a wonderful friendship between Alleyn and journalist Nigel Bathgate.  The series definitely improves over time, but I always like to begin at the beginning.  Personally, I prefer Marsh to Christie; maybe because I'm a procedurals fan.  Whatever your preference, there are interesting characters, effective red herrings, the classic reveal all of which result in a very satisfying read.	2005-09-03

Horn definitely has a past for which he is still paying.  He is also very human, feeling guilt for his own past, knowing he is not the hero cowboy, and often leaping to the wrong conclusion.  But he also has that sense of right that keeps driving him forward.  The books are well plotted and the supporting characters are as interesting as John.  Wright puts the reader in post WII Los Angeles when the studio system was still in existence, everyone smoked and men wore hats.  I have very much enjoyed both books in this series and look forward to reading the next.	2005-09-01

However, the third time was a charm and by page 53, I was hooked and stayed up way too late to finish it.  I'm not a lawyer, and I think some of the legal detail is what slowed me down.  I really liked the character of Cinda.  I did have to remind myself the story is set in 1990/1991 and being very liberal, one of the major plot points seemed a non-issue to me, but I know that not true even today.  The story builds well and the ending is effective, even though I guessed it.  Overall, I though it was good and will read the next, because it's already on my shelf, but I'm not certain I'd have sought it out otherwise.  Think I'll stick to Grisham.	2005-08-31

Sarah is an excellent character; smart and gutsy, with an interesting family and a begrudging helper.  The depiction of San Francisco and the issues of the time are well done without overwhelming the basic story.  I learned new things and was kept in suspense at the same time.  The plot is tight, the mystery expends and the story progresses.  I am delighted to know I have the second in the series waiting on my shelf.	2005-08-28

The story is told by Llywelyn, which gives it a humanity and personal view as he talks about his fears and insecurities.  Barker is an enigmatic, but we learn about him as does Llywelyn.  I very much enjoy developing relationship between the two characters.  The author has clearly done his research of the time and includes a literary figure as a secondary character. The writing is excellent with some of the best first lines, in the prologue and first chapter, I've read in a long time. I would read the series in order but this was a very good read in, what looks to be, a wonderful new historical mystery series.	2005-08-27

He is tall, lean, attractive, smart, an excellent shot and at hand-to-hand combat, well liked by his superior and subordinates, and has a perfect wife and baby. He easily gets the cooperation of other police agencies and bad guys tell him everything.  It all gets to be a bit much.  So why do I keep reading the series?  Because under all that is a decent procedural with just enough suspense to keep me going.  It's a quick, okay read.	2005-08-21

These are traditional mysteries; not cozy but not dark, and they always touch on series issues.  Ms. Greenwood has clearly done extensive research about the time and I always learn something when I read these books.  Poisoned Pen is releasing the series in hardcover with the delightful illustrated covers.  Unfortunately, they started in the middle of the series, so it's not easy to find the early book.

The characters are marvelous, the dialogue is crisp and funny, and yet the killer is creepy and terrifying.

This review is for \\"Cold in the Earth.\\"  Even though I suspected the killer, it didn't diminish my enjoyment in the reading. The characters are dimensional and so well drawn.  The dialogue is excellent, even with the Scottish terms I didn't quite understand.  She descriptions paint visual pictures of the people and the area which build tension and suspense in the plot.

Many of the characters are known by more than one name, which was confusing, and I didn't feel I got to really know any of the characters well. Moreover, there were points I wasn't certain I cared.  There were opportunities for the story to really draw the reader in, but they just weren't realized.  Finally, you learned the true importance of the icon in the last quarter of the story but it was a long time getting there.

But that's not why I rated it \\"poor.\\"  It's because I figured out, almost from the beginning, who was behind it all and after that, I really didn't care.  There were red herrings trying to divert suspicion, chapters that took you into the killer's mind, a massive government conspiracy, a romance for the protagonist, and I still didn't care.  In fact, I ended up skimming through most of the book.  I've enjoyed other books by Hecht, but just can't recommend this one.	2005-08-11

The interesting characters, particularly Brody, the investigating policeman, Irving, O'Connor's neighbor upstairs, and Dashiell, Rachael's dog, kept me going.  The story picked up in the second half picked up considerably and it became an interesting story of family secrets and guilt.  At the end, I did quite enjoy it, but more for the characters than the plot.	2005-08-09

I had read the first in this series, \\"The Fractal Murders,\\" which I enjoyed, but this was even better.  His style reminds me of the very best of Robert Parker--sense of place, great characters and dialogue-without the things which have begun to bother me.  I very much enjoy the relationship Keane has with his friends, family, and even with the witness. There's no pretentiousness, or annoying girlfriend, but there is humor although people keep telling Keane he's not as funny as he thinks he is, good action and suspense.  It was an exciting, enjoyable read.	2005-08-07
US	33993847	R2UWC0HOM78T	0312336810	2318179	The Rogues' Game	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Absolutely wonderful!	This is a mystery about an elaborate grift set in Post WWII Texas at the start of the oil boom.  All the characters are so well done and not stereotypical; Della, the beautiful blonde is also very business smart; Manlow Rhodes, the Presbyterian banker, \\"Chicken\\" Little, an old ex-con and breeder of gamecocks; Det. Ollie Marne, the cop on the take \\"would like to be a better man than his job and the circumstances in this town will allow him to be.\\", and many others including the protagonist who tells the story in retrospect.  The plotting, sense of time and place, dialogue and tension are first-rate.  There is a second standalone and a series on the way by Burton and you can bet I'm going to read them.	2005-08-07

It is an unusual and intriguing story that involved me at the first page and I read straight through.  It wasn't as suspenseful as I'd have hoped in that the deceit unraveled fairly quickly.  But it was very well written in the first person with humor and introspection from interesting and fully dimensional protagonist.	2005-08-06

Strengths:  a wonderful protagonist who serves as the eye in the middle of a tornado of delightful, quirky characters who are wonderfully drawn by the author; and a wonderful style of writing with some funny lines and lyric phrases.  Weaknesses:  The relationships are so complex I had trouble keeping track; and although you are told Annie has three daughters, you only meet and told the name of one of them.  But the strengths definitely overcome the weaknesses and combine to make for a delightful debut.  The next book is already on my shelf.	2005-08-05

Delaney has created great characters from Spook and Thomas, to Thomas' family and other characters, good and bad. I want to know how one gets a house boggart. The back of the book states \\"Warning: Not to be Read After Dark.\\" It's not quite that bad for adults but may make children cautious of mirrors.

While not a great work of literature, Ford has written another very exciting, suspenseful  story.  However, I wish there had more character development building of Frank, who seemed almost secondary in this book, and was put off by a credential attributed to the reporter.  There were some relevant social statements made but, overall, it was a story high action and a real page-turner, but without much to stay with you at the end of the story.	2005-08-01

Jance has given Beaumont two, distinct cases to be solved and it's done cleanly and without confusion.  Favorite characters from the past are there and I particularly like the way Jance handles the passage of time in their lives.  The cases are interesting with good suspense and twists along the way.  I would like the dialogue to have been a bit more crisp, but that's a small complaint.  I've missed J.P. and am glad to see him back.  If you've not read the series, definitely start with the first.  If, as I am, you're a fan, you'll definitely enjoy this new entry.	2005-07-31

Buchanan, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, has woven the past and the present into multi-layered story with interesting characters, excellent dialogue and very good suspense.  I was involved from the first sentence and didn't put it down until I'd read the last.  Buchanan is an author who deserves much more attention than she receives.  Her books aren't bloody, brutal or depressing; they are human, captivating and always worth reading.	2005-07-30

With a smashing beginning, literally, Emerson has written a very effective tale of a young man whose passivity costs others their lives and nearly destroys his own.  At the same time, he is caring and heroic and what he lacks in decisiveness, he makes up for in convection.  Jason is a fully drawn, very human character, and it's interesting watching his growth.  A diverse supporting cast, and good dialogue and suspense enhance the story, which is also a study of the power of greed.  I stopped reading Emerson for a while, as I wanted him to give me more from his writing.  This definitively puts him back on my author list.	2005-07-28

I like the character of Cadfael, who has come to the order later in life with a full history of experience behind him.

Fowler brings to life 1940s London during the Blitz offset by the Millennium Eye; the chaos of the streets during the Blitz and the insularity of a theatre; traditional police procedure versus use of a medium; a difficult, quirky detective offset by a personable classic investigator.  I felt the plot was overly complex and the story slow at times, but I was held in the story by the strong writing, humor, and the relationship between the two protagonists.  I look forward to reading the next book in this series.	2005-07-23

The plot is completely implausible with holes large enough to fly the shuttle through.

There are wonderful relationships, humor, great dialogue, a well-done sense of time and place, a bit of passion and excellent suspense.

This is a book probably most enjoyable to those who publish, write, sell or collect books.  Even so, there are delightful, realistically quirky characters, and a unique style of telling the story.

It's clear this is the beginning of a new series, and the element that indicated that was the one thing I found more annoying than intriguing about this book.  It felt too contrived.  However, the basic plot of this book was good.  I liked the characters, the dialogue, sense of place and all the elements that are important to me in a book.  Will I read the next in the series?

Once one gets past the huge coincidence and ignore that Reacher's response to any question is to shrug, you find an exciting, suspenseful, rather brutal read with some good characters and very good dialogue.  Jack is a loner but not above having a relationship.  There is non-stop action, a couple very good twists and some very interesting information about the U.S. currency system.  I'd place this in my airplane or beach book category, but I did enjoy it and plan to read more in the series.	2005-06-30

Spiegelman clearly knows whereof he speaks and actually makes the world of banking interesting.  He has created an interesting protagonist in John March, including a history revealed throughout the story.  The story does start out slowly and one has to get through the information about the banking industry, money laundering and data security, which s interesting and relevant but not exciting.  After that, the story definitely takes off and suspense builds to an exciting ending.  I very much enjoyed this debut book and am looking forward to his next.	2005-06-29

It's nice to see Connelly back writing a very good police procedural, and to have Harry back on the Force.  The story deals with the technical side of post-9/11 police work as well as the emotional side of the impact of a crime on the survivors.  Add to that Connelly's well-done dialogue, sense of place, ability to create believable relationships, and good twists, and one is treated to a very good book.	2005-06-28

Thomas has created a marvelous cast of characters with Llewelyn, Barker, the manservant Mac, French chef Dummolard, and even the feisty Pekinese Harm. The sense of time and place of Victorian England, taking us from elegant drawing room to the Jewish ghetto and the back alleys of London add richness to the story.  Because the story is told from Thomas' point of view, you share a bit of his frustration from being kept in the dark by Barker.  This does make the ending seem rather abrupt.  But that's a minor point when weighed against a very well written, enjoyable story.  I eagerly await the next case.	2005-06-26

Clemens has created a fully dimensional, very believable character in Stella and surrounded her with an excellent supporting cast.  She paints a realistic picture of farm life and has structured a solid mystery around it.  My only hesitation is that, to me, it seems a bit too structured and a bit predictable.

There is humor, sorrow, love, suspense, friendship, tragedy, brutality, revenge, fabulous sense of time and place and a fountain pen that connects the story together through time.  The language is flowery, and the pace sometimes slow but I never wanted to put it down.  There was a twist I didn't expect yet all the ends are neatly tied into a perfect circle at the end.

Chaucer was, in fact, a diplomat as well as poet.  The story is more political suspense, than a traditional mystery.  There is a very effective sense of threat and danger that runs as a top note through the story, as well as an excellent twist at the end.  There are stories within the story and a wonderful feel of time and place.  I think it does help to know the actual history.  For history lovers who don't need high action, I highly recommend it.	2005-06-14

I very much felt that which this series.  I appreciated the descriptions of the city, and the intricacy of the plot and having it unfold to me as it did the characters.  But I also found it hard to relate to the characters and felt the story was very slow.  It was easy for me to put the book down and hard to pick it back up.

Interesting characters, and excellent dialogue and sense of place hallmark Pronzini's writing.  It is understandable, as \\"Nameless\\" gets older, that he can't do as he once did and that Pronzini bring other characters into the agency, but it does dilute the focus.  But by taking away the mystique of \\"Nameless\\" and telling the various stories of each of the partners, this latest entry doesn't have the same introspection or tension of previous books.  That's not to say it's not a good book.  It's fast paced and each sub-story is interesting in it's own right.  It's not Pronzini at his best, but it's still better than good.	2005-05-31

The information on music boxes is fascinating and doesn't slow down the story.  My criticisms are small; for a wealthy doctor he never seems to practice, and I'm a little tired of couples who love each other but can't live together.

I made the mistake of starting this on a Tuesday morning, read until I had to leave for work, read at lunch, and stayed up way too late to finish it.  As always with Coben, it was suspenseful, exciting and full of twists and turns.  But one of the things I like best about his work is that he never loses the dimensionality and strength of his characters in the action.  You know who they are and what motivates them, which gives the book a bit more depth than your basic thriller.  The story includes the themes of love, trust, loyalty, friendship, forgiveness, commitment and family.  In the U.S. edition, you even receive a special treat in the form of a Myron/Win short story at the end of the book.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-27

It draws you in quickly, keeps you reading non-stop, and has interesting characters and excellent suspense.  But it also has some holes in the plot and a killer and motive I spotted fairly early on.  That didn't make it any less enjoyable, but does take it out of the \\"excellent\\" category into \\"very good.\\"	2005-04-24

While I found the plot a little weak, I very much enjoyed the character of Romilia, a rookie detective and Latina living with her son and mother.  She's smart, interesting and fully dimensional.  The writing is solid and I enjoyed the aspects of Latin culture incorporated into the characters and the story.  All in all, it's a good first effort.	2005-04-21

I had a bit of trouble caring about the supposed motive behind the murders and found it overly complicated.  But I did care about the character of Matthew.  He is well drawn, interesting and a character I would follow through a series.  For me, though, the most interesting aspect was Matt's trying to deal with the plague and its impact, which was beyond imagination.  It was a good first book; enough so that I shall read more of the series.	2005-04-20

The characters are realistic; Lisa who is trying to be a photographer but is working as a temp in the meantime; Debbie who is sweet, somewhat naïve, wanting to believe in romance and the best in people; and the arrogant businessman who feels wealth and position are the most important things of all.  Sense of place is well done, as is dialogue.  But what impressed me most of all is that it is not Lisa running around investigating clues, but the police who investigate and solve the crime.  And Ms. Nichols makes it all work, and ties it all together with a suspenseful ending and an absolutely delightful book.  I don't often gush, but this book deserves it.  Brava!	2005-04-15

I like the character of Zoe, she's smart, tough, independent and has been through a rough time.  Unfortunately, she's the only really developed character is the book.  She's also supposed to be in her mid-40's, but seemed about 10 years younger than that.  The story itself is good, but I had two major problems.  First, it's not hard to figure out who's behind the crimes and, second, the author way overuses the \\"had I but known\\" device at the end of chapters.  But it's the first book of the series, so I'll hope the subsequent books are better.  Still, it's a decent first book.<br /><br />Correction (4/2010):  Apparently, I was wrong on her age and she is in her 20s.  That is certainly more in keeping with the character and her actions.  I have, therefore, upgraded my rating from 2.5 to 3 stars.  Thanks to those who caught my error, the the site won't let me change the stars at the top.	2005-04-14

He's a tough ex-cop who knows how do to long stakeouts, understands judges and knows when a crime scene investigation has been bungled.  He also knows books, finding, valuing and selling them.  It's a combination that leads to a fully dimensional, and very interesting, character.  He also knows how to build an excellent supporting cast, create a sense of place and build tension.  If I wish his dialogue were better, that's a small criticism.  For those of us who love books and tough-but-tender investigators, this is a very enjoyable series.	2005-04-11

Todd is particularly skilled at providing us a very good sense of place, well done dialogue and an interesting, developed cast of characters, each with their own secrets and motives.  We feel Rutledge's frustration as he tries to uncover the truth and not be influenced by the emotions and accusations of those around him.  This is another very good entry to a well done series.	2005-04-11

Although clearly fantasy, I always think of these as mystery as there are always cases for John to solve but with clients and enemies beyond the norm.  I do wish Green would do more with the supporting characters and the endings were not quite as abrupt-maybe the books need to be a bit longer, which would be fine by me.  But he does manage to include ideas that make me stop and think a bit.  These books are not for the weak of stomach, but it's a series I very much enjoy this series, and this is another good addition.	2005-04-11

Not as much a mystery as a character study, it vacillates between multiple characters and two time periods, which I found tiring and a bit confusing.  Rozen's depiction of 9/11 and its aftermath are remarkable and sad, and the characters are a reflection of that.  However, I found the end very unsatisfying.  Parts of the book are very well done and, as Ms. Rosen is a resident of NYC, I certainly understand its impetus.  But personally, I'll admit I am anxious for the return of Bill and Lydia.	2005-04-10

Grace and the gang from the first book, MONKEEWRENCH do appear, so you might want to read it first.  But it's the Detectives who are the major players here, and we certainly benefit from them.  There is an excellent sense of place, wonderful dialogue, humor, suspense and a couple very well done twists along the way.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book	2005-04-10

At points Kincade really did seem TSTL and Mel, for someone losing his sight, seemed to see very well when the occasion called for it.  Other parts worked very well-very good suspense on the final visit to the island.  I also did feel I was missing a bit not having read other books in the series.  Overall, I enjoyed it.	2005-04-10

Unfortunately, I found the human characters flat and uninvolving.  There is good dialogue and suspense, but also massive coincidences and dangling threads left at the end.  I was sadly disappointed in this book.	2005-04-10

Although labeled as YA, the \\"adults\\" among us who love fantasy will also enjoy this book.  Told in first person by Bartimaeus and third person by Nathaniel, it's wonderfully done.  Bartimaeus, being 5,000 years old, is sharp, sarcastic, funny and engaging, while Nathaniel really reads as the lesser character who is certainly no Harry Potter, so it will be interesting to see how the series develops.  But, if you are looking for a break from mysteries, this is a delightful interlude.	2005-04-10

There are some significant holes in the plot and the characters could have been more developed but, for me, that was offset by the richness of the descriptions and the wonderful dialogue.  It is not a classic time-travel romance, although that is an element, but it made me think and taught me some things about art, science and music.  I very much enjoyed this book, find myself still thinking about it and hoping he writes another book.	2005-04-10

Mallory is a fascinating character and we learn even more about her past.  But this is not at all the usual mystery.  Mallory is almost a secondary player to other strange and, in their own ways, haunted characters.  My reaction reminds me a bit of the way I felt about Lehane's \\"Shelter Island,\\" in that I'm not certain I can say I loved the story, but I absolutely love her writing.	2005-04-10

It raised my anger at mankind throughout centuries whose actions have resulted in war and atrocities  However, it is a very well written story with duo views of Tejada the Nationalist and Gonzalo Llorente the Republican; as well as within Tejada himself when he realizes the woman he killed had been innocent.  The descriptions are brutal but the book is excellent and well deserved having received an Edgar.	2005-04-10
US	33993847	R2N8WGQ0CU9TS	1569473307	121676715	Maisie Dobbs	Books	3	6	7	N	N	Only okay.	This is primarily a background novel about Maisie who is, by the way, precognitive.  She is also very taken with herself and, to me, cruel to one she says she loves.  The far more interesting character is Billy, who plays a secondary role.  The story of the men who fought in WWI is, by far, the strongest and most poignant part of the story.  The actual mystery is almost incidental to the story and relies on information you are unaware she obtained, Billy's willingness to be the legman, and Maisie's intuitive powers.  Although there were part of the book by which I was moved, I was disappointed overall.  I've ordered the next book but It will need to be significantly stronger for me to continue with this series.	2005-04-10

This was an interesting Spenser as there was must less violence and much more investigation.

Maybe I've just hit my limit of the anti-hero, and I freely state that I need to feel an affinity to the characters to really like a book.  I know others have really liked this book, but I found myself reading to get to the end, particularly as you know, fairly early on, who is the killer.  In fact, I felt more emphasis was spent building his characters than the protagonist.  On the plus, it is well written and suspenseful, but I'm going back to books where there are protagonists I like and maybe even have qualities I can admire.	2005-04-10

No so here!  The characters are so well drawn and interesting, each stands clearly on it's own, yet they weave together to form a very good story.  It also provides and interesting, and timely, backstage look at the running of a presidential campaign.  I've always felt Weir is a much-overlooked writer who deserves more notice.  I highly recommend this series.	2005-04-10

The relationship between Monk and Hester has deepened and Ms. Perry enables the reader to feel that relationship.  There is a sense of place that makes part of Victorian London, excellent plotting and wonderful characters including strong secondary characters.  But most of all, you feel the threat and courage of the characters when placed in an overwhelming situation.  I've been a fan of Ms. Perry since her first book but had to warm up to the Monk series.  This book not only convinced me about the series but I believe this is the best book she's written to date.	2005-04-10

I'd not read Tapply prior to this but didn't feel lost in the series.  I very much enjoyed the characters, the fact that Coyne is ethical, and the fact that we didn't spend any time in the courtroom.  The sense of place and dialogue were excellent.  I knew who the killers were very early into the story but not the motive behind it all, and there was a good twist at the end.

One of the strengths of this series is that McCone is a character who changes and grows over time.  I liked that this book had her looking back to realize those changes. She's not so independent that she hasn't built relationships nor so tough that she has trouble dealing with her diabetic cat.  There are good supporting characters, a tight plot and plenty of suspense.  This may not be her very best book, but it's a solid installment to an excellent series.	2005-04-10

With the story set in my own San Francisco Bay Area, I very much enjoyed the locations and appreciate manner in which he presented the problems of the Dept. of Fish and Game.  I would never have guessed abalone smuggling could be more profitable than drugs.  However, even with all the bodies and climatic encounter with Kline, I never felt the suspense of this book or a real involvement with the characters.

It saddened me as the character of Michael is young and highly intelligent, yet seemingly unwilling to leave the violent life he's living.  It is brutal, filled with profanity and violence, but wonderfully written.  If you can deal with the first two, it's worth reading for the writing alone.	2005-04-10

I didn't feel this was the strongest book of the series and found the story a bit less suspenseful than others in the past. It's interesting that as Munch becomes more \\"mainstream,\\" which is great for the growth of the character, she is less edgy and interesting.  It's still a very good series with a wonderful, strong, female character, but I'm going to be interested to see where it goes from here.	2005-04-10

However, if you love Gothics, as do I having started Victoria Holt and the early books of Mary Stewart, you will be delighted.

This is the second year Ms. Perry has taken one of the secondary characters from her main series and given them their own Christmas mystery novella, which is wonderful.  It's a tradition I hope she continues.  There is no one who creates a sense of time and place, as does she.  The story contains a message of the true spirit of Christmas, wrapped in a very good mystery.  If you're either a Perry fan or one who loves period mystery, I highly recommend it.	2005-04-10

Sansom creates a superb sense of time and place providing incredible detail of daily life in the 16th century, an interesting cast of characters, a decent mystery and an exciting black-and-white movie ending.  I particularly liked the character of Shardlake and felt for him when he realizes the cause and a person in whom he believed, isn't motived by pure purpose, but by self-preservation and greed.  For fans of English history, this is an excellent historical mystery.	2005-04-10

You know Trevor is being set up as a patsy, but are fascinated to see the result.  Although I was, occasionally, annoyed by Trevor's seeming spinelessness, his youth, relationship with his parents, and background allowed me to accept him.  The relationship between the government, tobacco industry and legal system was fascinating.  If you're looking for a book in which to lose yourself for a few hours, or the perfect airplane book, I recommend giving this a try.	2005-04-10

The negatives - it didn't seem that this would have been considered a 1st degree homicide, particularly with special circumstances and I felt the ending was very weak.  The positives - I love the characters of Mike and Rosie, I enjoy his humor, and he certainly knows San Francisco.  I'll definitely keep reading Siegel, but his wasn't his best.	2005-04-10

Yes, there's still Roark, but he is less involved with the case than he once was.  I love the cast of characters, the crisp, witty dialogue, and Eve's constant battle with her cars and the chocolate thief.  But there were also scenes that brought tears to my eyes and others that made me catch my breath in suspense.  The books in this series are always good reads.	2005-04-10

There are layers upon layers in this story of a house, a family, relationships and greed.  I have loved the Mallory series from the start and this is one of the best.  You learn more about Mallory's partner Riker and vulnerability of Charles, Mallory's friend and business partner, is a wonderful contrast to the character of Mallory.  I would not recommend starting the series with this book, but it is a definitely an excellent addition to the series.	2005-04-10

One thing I like, and which makes Siegel's books stand out for the normal legal thriller, is now little time is spent in the courtroom.  Siegel, a practicing attorney himself, focuses on the characters involved and the investigation prior to the case going to court.  And, living across the Bay from San Francisco, I always appreciate his very accurate descriptions of the City.  While not terribly suspenseful, this is a very well done, enjoyable series and one I continue to follow and recommend.	2005-04-10

Russell has the incredible ability to teach me a lot-the hospitality industry, West Point and the military, personal history of presidents, dueling, and more-while telling great story.  Travis was a wonderful character.  His descriptions of the Washington D.C. area are excellent.  Even though it definitely bogged down at the end, I started in early in the morning, read it at lunch and finished it when I came home from work.  I really enjoyed this book.	2005-04-10

I read this on plane home for Christmas and laughed myself halfway across the country.  I may now have a problem reading Gift of the Magi, eating lasagne or shopping at Ikea.

Although the plot seems overly complex and the pace a bit slow, Rankin is a remarkable writer who paints a picture of the problems of open immigration and how those people can be abused.  Rebus is a marvelous character and it's wonderful to see Siobhan coming into her own.  While perhaps not his best, one can never go wrong with one of Rankin's books.	2005-04-10

The characters are not well-developed and the plot is somewhat predictable, but it was entertaining and took me to the end to see whether my guess as to who was The Owl was correct - it was.

Having lately bemoaned the lack of strong, ethical-but-not-perfect protagonists, I've found one in McKenzie.  When an embezzler offers him half the money, he chooses to quit the Force, turn the crook in and collect the reward money; he becomes angry at his best friend thinking of having an affair, and he berates himself in alphabetic order \\"Ass. Bastard. Creep...\\" This is a fast-moving book with excellent descriptions and dialogue, although a little weak on the secondary characters.  But I was late for work because of not being able to put it down.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and have ordered all this other books.	2005-04-09

The fun of this book is the main characters of Rep and Melissa and the itinerary references.  The weakness is and that, at times, the literary references occasionally seem forced and get in the way of the story, and the complete implausibility of the plot.  But it's worth a look if you're in the mood for something light that will test your memory of literature.	2005-04-09

The main reason this did not rate more highly was my constant irritation of the author referring to previous cases and history yet knowing this is the first book in the series.  However, the character of Mornay is interesting; dimensional and imperfect, along with his partner Constable Claire Gillespie.  Even though I did suspect the identity of the killer fairly soon, there was enough going on to make me turn the pages and keep me involved.  I shall probably follow this series to the next book, more for the characters than the plot.	2005-04-09

The information on the history relating to books was interesting, I'm not the least involved in computer games so that was lost on me,  and the story rather plodded along without real suspense, without a murder, and with a horribly-done ending.  I definitely wouldn't compare it to Di Vinci Code in terms of a page-turning read but if you've nothing else on the shelf or are stuck at the airport, it's okay.	2005-04-09

I'll admit I love Gothics and so was delighted to find a new author who writes them.  I learned a bit about English history, architecture, and music.  While not horribly scary, which was fine by me, there was excellent sense of place, a bit of pathos in the story of the ghosts, and a very enjoyable read.	2005-04-09

Boyle does a wonderful job with setting, providing a real picture of the cities and towns of Maine yet the solitude, which exists immediately outside them, and the cold of winter.  You also feel Jack's reluctance to become involved with Rocky yet his inability to walk away.  There is a strong element of pathos to this story, but it's still suspenseful and a page-turner.	2005-04-09

I have loved Tami Hoag's books since her early romantic/suspense novels and she has only gotten better.  There are wonderful characters, great suspense, fast-paced action, and a twist at the end I didn't see coming.  I picked this book up thinking I'd read a few pages and didn't put it down until I'd finished it.	2005-04-09

As always, there is Bruen's precise, spare writing, which remind me just a bit of McBain, which lets you get to know the characters without excessive description.  He characters are not particularly likable, but always interesting.  Not as dark as his Jack Taylor books but still very well done.	2005-04-09

While I always learn new things in reading Ms. Connor's books, I also find myself wishing she'd get on with the story.  After being told, way too many times, that the character is an expert in knots and likes caving, I did a lot of skipping through the story.  The dialogue is wooden and awkward, and, for my taste, the plot could have been edited down to a tighter, faster-moving story.  It's an okay book	2005-04-09

The plot was suspenseful-man against man, man against nature--had excellent dialogue and lots of disreputable characters.  The only likable character was the protagonist, and it just seemed off balance to me.  The problem was the only part of the story in which I really became engrossed was the ship in the hurricane.  The rest I found myself skimming through.  Those who like macho good guy stories, although without any likable or interesting side kicks, might enjoy this, but for me, it was strictly an okay read.	2005-04-09

The characters were flat and overdone,  the story not as suspenseful as it could have been and, what should have come across as an overwhelming moral dilemma, just didn't come through.  It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't great.	2005-04-09

The characters, particularly Tal, June and Henry had some interesting points but could have been much stronger.  A major weakness was that I figured out the killer relatively early on.  But, I didn't figure out the motive, so a definite point there.  Overall, it was a good first book but I'll hope to see great improvement with the second book.	2005-04-09

You truly get to know Terry and his friends as you join them in their day and work.  There's very good dialogue and light humor.  It's heavy on profanity, but not inappropriate for the characters.  I read the first in the series and will probably keep following Terry and the gang.  This is a fun, quick read.	2005-04-09

It does takes one back to a time before computers and cell phones when detectives worked occasionally on bribes and intimidation, but also on instinct and legwork.  However, many of the conclusions reached by Lam are a bit hard to believe, and most of the characters are over the top.  However, it is a detective story in the classic sense, and a black-and-white movie fun read.	2005-04-09

But for that, I never had a real sense of the character.  The plot is interesting, but so focused on character that it is way too slow at times and I found myself skimming, and when the killer is exposed I had to go back to figure out when he'd been introduced to the story. I have to admit being disappointed.  It was an okay read, but nothing extraordinary.	2005-04-09

I found myself thinking of this as a very \\"Irish\\" book, in that pace and mood seemed to reflect the Irish bogs.  There are numerous characters lives are as intertwined as a Celtic knot.  I found myself a bit annoyed at Nora at times, but not so much that it detracted from the story.  While perhaps not as good as her first book, it still a very good read.	2005-04-09

John Harvey won the first-ever Sherlock Award for the best detective created by a British author, and deservedly so.  I was sorry when Harvey retired his Charlie Resnick series, although Charlie makes a very brief appearance here, but Harvey certainly didn't retire his writing skills.  He knows how to draw you into the story and keep you there to the very end.  Well-developed characters, good dialogue, tension, a very literate style; these are all hallmarks of Harvey's writing.	2005-04-09

It felt very slow at times and had a number of things left unexplained.  I don't mind the element of mysticism but it didn't feel complete.  Joe, his family and friends are great characters, the story definitely had me turning the pages and completing it in a day but it wasn't quite as strong as his previous books.  Don't misunderstand; this is still a very good read and a series I shall continue to follow, but I hope the next entry will have a bit more suspense to it.	2005-04-09

His sense of place is excellent; when he describes a blizzard, you're reaching for a blanket even if it's 80 outside.  And his plots have wonderful twists and turns along the way that I never see coming.  I think this is a much under-recognized whose books, to me, rank right there with Connolly, Connelly, Lehane and Rankin.  The series doesn't have to be read in order, but I'd recommend it.  And don't forget his standalone.	2005-04-09

Let me start by saying I read books for character; if I don't like the characters, it's a good bet I won't like the book.  For me, this book didn't have a single character about whom I could care.  There's the lawyer who is cheating on his wife and family, there is the protagonist lawyer who is having an affair with his \\"best friend's\\" mistress.  That alone was enough to make me stop reading.  If that doesn't bother you, the plot was decent enough, although slow and, at points very repetitive.  The only reason I ranked this higher than NR was because, to be fair, others in our Mystery Group rated this book Good to Very Good.  While they agreed they didn't like any of the characters and found some things improbable, they felt the characters and plot were well done.  But for me, I kept thinking how many other, better books with more interesting characters I had waiting to be read.	2005-04-09

With shades of the 87th Precinct, the Cold Case Squad has a wonderful cast of characters with diverse pasts and lives yet working well together as a team.  There is excellent dialogue, humor and descriptions of Miami, but balanced with interesting procedure and good suspense.  While it helps to have read \\"The Ice Maiden,\\" it's not completely necessary as this is a wonderful book on it's own and I hope to see a lot more of the Cold Case Squad.	2005-04-09

Oz Blackstone is the lighter of Jardine's two series, the other being police procedurals featuring Bob Skinner. Still, the character admits he's finally growing up and getting his life in order.

Gabaldon presented a different side of 18th century English society which kept me reading.  She is excellent at providing sense of place and creating interesting characters.

Although it helps to have read the first two books in the series to understand Joe, the other characters are interesting and well developed.

Coleman is an excellent writer and Moe is a wonderful, fully-dimensional character who, while a tough ex-cop, is human with a family he loves and secrets he carries.

I am so pleased Poisoned Pen published Mr. Anderson's 3rd book and have reprinted the first two books.  I'd waited a long time for this book and was not disappointed.

I kept feeling that Connelly was so upset with the way Blood Work had been handled as a film he killed off the main character and derided it in nearly every chapter of this book.  The characters were flat, Harry was almost unappealing as a character, and there was very little suspense until the end.

And there were a couple other very good characters in the policeman Hart and reporter Sexton.  The pace is tense and fast and keeps you turning the pages late into the night.  Although I was disappointed with the very end of the book, I shall certainly be first in line for his next one.	2005-04-09

Set in Maine and Boston, Gerry Boyle does excellent sense of place, interesting characters, particularly his friend Clair, involving plots and good red herrings.  I've always enjoyed this series and this is one of the best.	2005-04-09

Although I found the plot a bit slow and meandering at times, the picture it provided of the social structure and mores of the Edwardian period  was  fascinating.  The book is classic M.C. Beaton in that the diversity of characters is the strength of the story, rather than the plot.  In all, this is a light bit of stuff.	2005-04-09

I would recommend reading the series in order.  If you're looking for a quick, light read, these fill the bill.	2005-04-09

I was delighted that The Bard is a secondary character rather than the investigator, and that one does not need a great knowledge of Shakespeare or his plays to enjoy the book.  It is a classic mystery with clues and suspense along the way.  I loved the character of Nick Revill and didn't feel hampered by having started the series late into it.  This was the first I've read in this series, but have already ordered all the others.	2005-04-09

By a Canadian author, it was nice to read a book set somewhere new to me; Ottawa.  This is a solid police procedural with fully-developed characters, interesting forensic information, clues tracked down one-by-one, and enough suspense to keep me going. I shall definitely read the other two books, so far, in this series.	2005-04-09

Skinner is the antithesis of Rebus-tall, lean, no discernable bad habits, a close relationship with his superiors, officers, daughter and girl friend.  Takes a bit of getting used to. I found this a very good police procedural with twists along the way, well done atmosphere and quite good suspense.  I've already ordered the next two books in the series, and would definitely recommend giving these a try.	2005-04-09

The writing was good but seemed very deliberate and rather overblown, irritating with name dropping, unnecessarily heavy on sex scenes, and an incredibly weak ending.  I found myself nearly quitting several times thinking of all the other really good books waiting on my shelves.  Instead it was one I could have not started and not missed.	2005-04-09

I learned a lot about Tourette's, which I found interesting, but be aware the author crosses from the book being a neurological thriller into psychological horror toward the end.  There was one scene toward the end I would prefer to have seen done differently, but overall felt this was a very good book with some very interesting characters.  I shall definitely read more by Mr. Hecht.	2005-04-09

I was fascinated by the different spiritualists, the ways Martin devised to expose them, and felt his quandary over Mina (my mother's name).  This was one of those books once started, I couldn't put down.  This is a wonderful, well-written book-and a mystery, of sorts, without a murder.	2005-04-09

It did neither.  It did remind me to pay attention to the impact people have on our lives, and we on theirs, every single day.  I loved what this little book had to say.	2005-04-09

Gardner has written a wonderful story with excellent characters.  She has exposed a period of seeming elegance to have very little grace at all.  The character Lacey is intriguing and fully dimensional.  The story is full of twists and revelations, but intriguingly, not irritatingly, so.  I shall definitely follow this series and highly recommend it for those who love historical mysteries.	2005-04-09
US	33993847	R1C2JZ6UD6ECDV	0425199436	871994600	The Glass House	Books	4	7	7	N	N	A great series.	Gardner does an excellent job of portraying Regency England.  His character is the essence of honor, yet is by no means perfect and I find myself wanting to know more about him.  There are excellent secondary characters who provide a strong sense of the period.  The plot held me from beginning to end.  This is a series which has improved with each book, and I find myself anxious to read the next installment.	2005-04-09

That said, it doesn't lack for suspense or things that go bump--for me, parts were better read during the day-but it doesn't cross the line into horror.  Cree is a well-drawn, well-rounded character with strength, but not lacking in fear, and internal ghosts of her own with which she is trying to deal.  The secondary characters are well drawn and you understand their motivations.  An additional character is New Orleans itself, which is very well and accurately depicted.  Mr. Hecht has created a great story.	2005-04-09

Being this was the first Hill I've read, I definitely felt the lack of history with the characters.  I found myself wanting to know them better.  But they were the best part of the story.  Except for particular bits, I found the plot not over interesting and the book way over long.	2005-04-09

The characters are great, although they might make a bit more sense if you've read the \\"Blood\\" series,  the writing and dialogue have all the humor I've come to expect from Huff. \\"Summon the Keeper\\" by her was one of the funniest books I've read. Unfortunately, what's missing here is a really good plot.  Still, it's fun, light, camp and a great airplane book or diversion from mysteries.	2005-04-09

Maron's first book \\"Booklegger's Daughter\\" is still a standout for me, and I'd moved away from this series. But, while lighter than I usually read, although not really a cozy, I very much enjoyed this book.  The character Deborah is a wonderful blend of southern gentility, contemporary independence and backwoods strength and survival that make this book well worth reading.	2005-04-09

Although the dialogue is weak in points and the plot fairly light, it is definitely the characters that drive this book.  I am definitely going to follow Sam and the crew to see where their adventures take them as this looks to be a very enjoyable new series.	2005-04-09

And the dialogue is weak in the extreme.  It is extremely rare when a television series is better than the books but the BBC series of Hamish Macbeth is. This is a very light series anyway, but this story was one of the weakest.	2005-04-09
US	33993847	R1VWBIC2UGDBWA	1400031575	342108579	Faceless Killers	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Highly recommended.	Although the translation into English made the dialogue a bit awkward at times, it did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.  Wallander is fully dimensional, very fallible-yet-determined, and surrounded by strong supporting characters.  Although told in third person, the writing has a first person feel in the way you know what's going on inside Wallander's thoughts.  There's plenty of action and suspense, and even a red herring that leaves you feeling the frustration of Wallander trying to solve his case.  It also introduced me to the problems in a country about which I hadn't previously known.  I recommend the book and know I'll be looking for others by the author.	2005-04-09

Doug is a wonderful naïve-but-not protagonist, fabulous sense of place, great characters, wonderful dialogue that at time had me laughing aloud, and an ending that definitely makes you want to go along with Doug on his next adventure.  A contender for my annual top 10 list, I loved this book!	2005-04-09
US	33993847	R3DR1QOOWOUQKD	0061032212	411648778	Sleepyhead	Books	3	0	1	N	N	3.5 stars - Good+	Billingham has created some very interesting characters; Thorne, a relentless investigator who empathizes with the victims but is certainly not supercop; Dr. Anne Cobert, Alison's doctor who becomes Thorne's lover; and Alison herself.  The dialogue is quite good as is the level of suspense-not over the top but done well in the right places.  I already have Billingham's next two books and am looking forward to reading them.	2005-04-09

One of the things I find most interesting about Ms. Fradkin's writing is that the pace of the writing very much reflects the character of the protagonist - steady and dogged in his investigation.  This is not a bad thing.  If anything, her character has a more realistic tone than some.  You feel his frustration with his job, the problems he has balancing it and his life with his new family.  These are not tires squealing, guns blazing books, but very well written police procedurals.  I enjoyed it very much.	2005-04-09

The character of Lizzie is an interesting one; a social worker, she suffers the aftershock of a violent incident with one of her patients.  Yet, dealing with her own internal demons, she feels obligated to Phillip.  The story focuses primarily on Lizzie's internal thoughts while carrying out her task.  It's very well written but rather gloomy.	2005-04-09
US	33993847	R1JXTRE2N22IPV	0743435486	519289007	Lord Darcy	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Great fun!	In the 1960's of an alternative universe and with elements of Nero Wolfe, Sherlock Holmes and The Man from U.N.C.L.E., you have a delightful combination of fantasy and who-done-it.  The stories - The Eyes Have It, A Case of Identity, The Muddle of the Woad, and Too Many Magicians - made me laugh, and think and marvel at the talent and imagination of Randall Garrett.  I shouldn't read them back-to-back as they can get to be a bit much.  If you enjoy Jasper Fforde, you might enjoy Lord Darcy as well.	2005-04-09

Taylor's world is not a place one would ever want to visit:  a part of London called Nightside where it is always 3 a.m.  But, except for the monsters, has the feel and elements of a classic detective novel.  If you enjoy Jim Butcher or Charlaine Harris, you might give these a try.  I'd recommend starting at the beginning of the series but do feel this is the best so far.  I shall be eagerly awaiting book four and the next visit to Nightside.	2005-04-09

Tess Gerritsen knows how to write suspense; and this is definitely suspense and much less a medical thriller than most of her books.  Although the opening is a bit clich&eacute;, what follows is engrossing and disturbing.  There is suspense, twists aplenty, and a climax I definitely didn't see coming.  It's a fast read because you don't want to put it down.	2005-04-09

The story felt less dated and the tone was lighter but not silly.  If there were a couple people who've not read this series, this book would even read as a stand-alone.  I had nearly given up on this series a few books ago, but am very glad I stayed with it.  This book was great fun to read.	2005-04-09

Even if you've not read others in the series, you have a sense of who the characters are.  You feel Lewis' pain of losing his friend and how that friend has impacted Lewis' life.  But there's good suspense as well and a well-done twist at the end.  I have always enjoyed this series, and this is certainly one of his best.	2005-04-09

If you've not read Da Vinci code and always wanted to know the history of Friday the 13th or what happened to the Knights Templar, this book will tell you.  But under the historical information and setting, is a well-done look at life during that period, interesting characters and relationships, and a pretty decent mystery. I definitely enjoyed this and shall definitely keep following Simon and Sir Baldwin.	2005-04-09

This is a superb series filled with action, intrigue, humor, tragedy, war, romance and, yes, a bit of mystery.  Dunnett's research into the period was unparallel.  This, the first book, is a bit difficult to get into, which is why I obtained the unabridged audiobook from my library and listened to it while commuting, but well worth the effort.  She does use a lot of foreign phrases, which can make the reader a bit frustrated, but one can either pass over them and not lose the effect of the story, join the Game of Kings group on Yahoo, or look them up either themselves or in Elpeth Morrison's \\"Companion\\" books.  If you're looking for a break from mysteries and love history, this is a marvelous alternative.	2005-04-09

The plot is pretty thin and it's not the best of the series, but the delightful characters and laugh-out-loud humor are what keep me coming back.  It's astounding that Stephanie gets away with what she does, but I think Ranger says best the reason I so enjoy these books \\"this is a high-stress business, and you're comedy relief.....\\"  These are stressful times in which we live and I, for one, can certainly use comedy relief.	2005-04-09

Although I don't feel this is one of his best, it still a fun ride.	2005-04-09

Pepper is intelligent and fully dimensional, a man still on the search for who he is.  There are wonderful relationships between him and his family and friends, and well as some good humor.  I even learned something about fractal geometry and philosophy along with way without it miring the plot.  There's not a lot of suspense, but it's the characters that drive the story and the killer is a complete surprise.  I also enjoyed the inclusion of small towns and cities settings; Nederland and Boulder, Colorado; Lincoln, Nebraska and Walla Walla, Washington.  I really enjoyed this book and will be interested to see where the series goes from here.	2005-04-09

Cozies are not my preferred genre, but I read this, as it was one of our Mystery Group's selections.  While the pace and the abundance of daily-live detail is something to which I am not accustomed, I found the plot to be quite good and definitely appreciated the idea of people not being as they seem.  Mrs. Malory is not cloying or a busybody. For cozy fans, I recommend it.	2005-04-09

The profanity, violence and pace are unrelenting.  But Hank loves his parents and does everything he can to protect Bud and it's those bits of humanity that balance the rest.  I am not a Tarantino fan, or I'm certain I'd have rated it higher, but found I couldn't but this book down.	2005-04-09

I did feel I'd have been better having read the previous books in the series to understand the characters better, but it was still fast paced and had a couple good twists.  While not exceptional, it's a good page-turning read.	2005-04-09

What this book may have lacked in suspense and plot twists, it more than made up for interesting, fully-developed characters and providing a picture of the period and, being a huge fan of Dick Francis, the racing world turning that time.  I've always thought of his books as somewhat elegant reads.  I do highly recommend this series for those who love elegant writing and period history.	2005-04-09

There seems to be a rise of the anti-hero but at least Dexter knows exactly what he is, and you are so told almost too many times.  Dexter is a fascinating character-I kept thinking of Harlan's Cobin's Win.  Unfortunately he's the only really well drawn character in the book; the others seem flat and stereotypical.  The ending was a bit unsatisfactory but the story was tight and well plotted.  There is a book two in the works and I'm certain I'll see where the series goes from here.	2005-04-09

Ms. Hamilton, who is currently writing the 4th book in the series but is quite ill so there is no knowing when it may be done, does a masterful job portraying the period and the conflicting roles religion and magic played in people's lives.  There is humor and suspense in a fast-moving story.  This is a marvelous book in an excellent series.  (Later note:  Ms. Hamilton passed away in February 2005.

Slightly edgier, which I liked, than the previous two entries, Terry and his friends are blue collar, realistically written and fun to be among.  L.T.

I did appreciate his including a character list in this one and I found it a bit slower getting into than previous books, but I still laughed, know I missed some of the jokes, and marveled at this author's talent and imagination.  I definitely recommend reading the series in order.  Remarkable books.	2005-04-09

Sylvian Hamilton writes some of the best opening lines ever:  'In the crypt of the abbey church at Hallowdene, the monks were boiling their bishop...' She certainly doesn't whitewash the life of that period, but tells a wonderful, captivating story with strong characters.  Although I felt this book a bit less strong the book three, The Gleemaiden-forgiven as it is the first book after all, it was still wonderful.  I have become a huge fan of Ms. Hamilton, can't wait to read the second and for her to write the fourth.  This series has become a definite favorite of mine.

In some ways, I liked Alex better than Stephanie, as she's smarter and more self-reliant, whereas Hooker, the NASCAR guy, annoyed me.

He hears a woman's screams and rescues her son who'd fallen in an old well. But he also discovers the remains of a woman, Rachel Hayes, who had died in a firestorm in the 1870's. But once her remains are found, fires and deaths begin.<br /><br />Allyn starts us off with a dramatic prologue which clearly has a purpose and makes us want to know more.  It establishes themes which run through the entire story.<br /><br />The author has a wonderful voice and writes great dialogue...\\"One last question,\\" she said,\\" a medial one. Are you a good vet?\\"  \\"I try to be.  I was tops in my class at State.  My patients bark at me sometimes, but they never write nasty letters.\\"  \\"You have a strange sense of humor.\\"  \\"Thank you.\\"<br /><br />The characters are fully-dimensional.  Each has a past they are trying to overcome and with objectives for their futures.  They are real; they are alive and you feel their pain.  You find yourself empathizing with Westbrook.  You want to pull him back when he's about to do something stupid and are very relieved when he doesn't.<br /><br />Even the four-legged creatures become very real to us.  Allyn's descriptions and understanding of the animals is wonderful.  I shall caution that there are animals harmed in this book, but it was relevant to the plot and done with a purpose.  The protagonist is a vet and a rescuer.  It helps to keep that in mind.<br /><br />\\"The Burning of Rachel Hayes\\" is a gripping read with an underlying element of the Gothic and a bit of \\"something wicked this way comes\\" feel.  It is not a typical ghost story.  There is a paranormal element but one leaving you wondering whether it's truly paranormal or corporal.  It is filled with strong, diverse and interesting characters, both human and animal. I found myself caught up in the story. Parts of it stayed with me long after finishing the book. Although Mr. Allyn has written other books, he now concentrates on short stories, including the David Westbrook collection of \\"All Creatures Dark and Dangerous.\\"<br /><br />THE BURNING OF RACHEL HAYES (Myst-Dr. David Westbrook-Michigan-Contemp) - VG+<br />Allyn, Doug<br />Five Star, 2004ght up in the story.

While there is a mystery here, it is really the study of Jack that is the focus.

Wolstencroft, the writer of MI-5 shown on A&E, clearly has a well-developed sense of the absurd, creates more twists than a corkscrew factory, and leaves more bodies behind than Agatha Christie.

Pronzini is masterful at setting a scene, whether it be driving through the fog or building suspense.  His characters are real, and his dialogue is excellent.  In this book, he has taken a plot device which can destroy credibility in other books, and brilliantly made it part of solution.  This is a true detective novel in the very best sense and an excellent read.	2005-04-06

It begins in first person, moves to third person, and ends in first person.  Real people from the 60's are included in the story for no real purpose other than setting.  You're not certain whether it's a mystery or a family epic or both, but it so bogs down in the middle, I didn't particularly care.  Parker does a very good job conveying a segment of life during the 60's.  He is, in general, an excellent writer.  Unfortunately, this book is just not up to par for me.	2005-04-06

In spite of the length of the book, it did read quickly, probably because I did a lot of skimming.  Kerr's detail of the period is fascinating and well researched, but the characters of Ellis and Newton seemed a parody of Watson and Holmes and lacked any real depth.  Even though you were aware the author was trying to make the dialogue appropriate to the period, it came off stilted and awkward.  There were descriptive sex scenes which seemed gratuitous.  As one who enjoys historical mysteries, there are many better choices than this.	2005-04-06

Michael Koryta admits he is a huge fan of Dennis Lehane, which does show in his writing. Koryta is 22 years old, which does not show.  The difference is, rather than the psychopathic sidekick, this is a pair of ex-cops, one young who was fired, and his mentor partner who retired.  They are a great team.

However, none of that potential is realized.  Instead, it is badly written, filled with graphic sex and descriptions of the wealth Voort and his well-to-do partner. I found myself not caring about any of the characters.  There's a twist in the middle that makes reading the rest of the book almost irrelevant.

I wasn't certain, in the beginning, that I liked this book as it started off very slowly and I didn't particularly care for Amy.  But once Hardy was introduced, as well as Abe Glitsky, the pace picked up and the story became much more interesting.

While Scudder seems to have taken on a fairly routine, non-threatening case, you know there is another level much more threatening and suspenseful.  I did like that Scudder realizes he's not as young or quick, now that he's in his 60's, and that all my favorite characters were there.

There is excellent sense of place and dialogue and the emotions are well done.  Even though I figured out the killer, I didn't mind as I so enjoyed the journey along the way.  If you've not yet tried Housewright, do.  He is a pleasure to read.	2005-04-06

We learn a bit of Hawk and his background, and have the usual rehash of Spencer's relationship with Susan.  The usual cast of characters is there, as well as the Grey Man, and the dialogue is as well-done as always.  But, overall, there's just not much here.	2005-04-06

Johnson does a wonderful job of providing sense of place, including mysticism into the story without overwhelming it, and writing excellent dialogue with wry humor.  But mostly, it's the interesting characters about I want to know more.  I'm only sorry this is the first book as it means I have to wait another year for his next book.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-06

It's interesting to see Higgins move from spy thrillers to police procedurals, but gadgets and strong, clever good guys haven't been left behind.  This is a fun, quick read, perfect for a Sunday afternoon.	2005-04-06

The period felt more like the 50's than present day, and the only really dimensional character was Tony.  But this is a fun, quick, rather light read with a couple very good twists.	2005-04-06

Perhaps because I actually read \\"The Burning of Rachel Hayes\\" just before reading this book, and because of the continuity of protagonist through, these read more as chapters.  Although it was a bit disconcerting that one sub-story here was told differently in \\"Rachel Hayes,\\" I very much enjoyed this book and read it straight through in one evening.	2005-04-06

The plot is good, the dialogue excellent, the chapters' advance the action, and sense of place is very well done.  The only slight problem is that the character of Skinner, the antithesis of Ian Rankin's Rebus, is so perfect it's almost irritating.  Even so, the series is well done and exciting, and one I recommend.	2005-04-06

Amato is a wonderful, realistic character, surrounded by the cast of the opera and his family.  But we are also shown the dark and unpleasant side of this period and city and it's people.  The story seems to start with a fairly simple mystery and lots of suspects, but soon turns into something much darker and more complex.  This is a wonderful mix of music, mystery and history.	2005-04-06

The character of Max is interesting, but unrelentingly depressed and not as fleshed out as I'd have liked.  However, King does a wonderful job describing the Everglades and creating a sense of suspense.  I would possibly read more of this series.  This was a good read, perfect for an airplane or a Sunday afternoon.	2005-04-06

The very accurate portrayal of Berkeley and the Bay Area, adds an atmosphere that greatly enhances the story.  In general, I am not a fan of glorifying those who have broken the law, and I do feel the premise of Warren's becoming involved was a bit weak.  What really makes the story work is the characters, good suspense and, at the end, Warren's acknowledgement of what his life and actions has cost him.  I ended up caring about Warren and want to see where his life goes from here.  I know I'll be back for the next book.  This is a very good debut.	2005-03-27

Pronzini has truly captured the feel of New Orleans in this dark, creepy, scary book with a really poor ending.  However, he is a master at first person and bringing you into the thoughts and fears of his protagonist.  While definitely not his best book, he kept me turning the pages way past my bedtime.	2004-08-05

I found the plot of this fragmented and although loosely based on an actual incident, improbable.  The red herrings, rather than being effective, made the protagonist seem naïve.  The only thing that saved this book, for me, was the history, but that's not enough for me to recommend it as a mystery.	2004-08-05

This edition is particularly enjoyable as it includes an introduction by the author talking about introducing Hawes to the series.  Reading the 87th precinct books is always a delight; tight plots, crisp dialogue, well-drawn characters, good humor and excellent sense of place and time; all in fewer than 200 pages.  McBain's books are truly a master class in detective fiction.	2004-08-05

The descriptions of the inmates and life within the hospital are wonderfully done, but never with a sense of pity or condescension, nor are the administrators and doctors stereotypical \\"bad guys.\\"  Francis is a hero unlike any other in an environment where \\"normal\\" does not apply.  This is, to me, Katzenbach's best yet.	2004-08-05
US	33993847	RHSR85O3HWOG5	052594821X	89678523	The Hundredth Man	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A good first effort.	The character of Ryder and his history is intriguing if a bit familiar. I really enjoyed his experienced partner Harry.  The crimes are suitably unusual enough you really want to know who and why, and really don't know until the end.  But the secondary characters were, for the most part, easy stereotypes and their issues much to easily overcome.  All-in-all, it's a good first effort, but I'll hope for more from his next book.	2004-08-05

The season and locale also play an important role; I loved Jury's delight in an unbroken field of snow.  This was a delightful book with wonderful humor.  I enjoyed it very much.	2004-08-05
