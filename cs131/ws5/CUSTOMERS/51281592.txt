US	51281592	R3PUMDE3R2Q2QM	0142003808	28976631	Drop City	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Enjoyable and absorbing	I read this book after reading a (favorable) review in the newspaper. I actually expected it to be much more...subversive, might be the word I want, as if the author himself were a hippie thumbing his nose at society and doing something strange and exotic with characters and the plot. Instead, it was a conventional novel, which I found very welcome. In the story, it was unexpected to find a 1970s group of hippies (originally living in a commune called Drop City north of San Francisco) moving up to Alaska to try to continue their community up there.   (Not what you think of when you think &quot;hippie story.&quot;) They come in contact with non-hippies (&quot;straights&quot;) trying to live self-sufficiently there in the wild. It was great to get a feel for the differences and similarities between the two types, and to ultimately find out that there are some things we all (even straights) are after. I also liked the author's theme that there's really no place you can go to escape clashes and conflicts with other humans. Even if you have one neighbor, he or she could be the wrong one.<br />The only thing I found puzzling was Pamela, who marries a trapper living in a remote cabin in the wilds of Alaska. She does this because she's afraid of what's happening to society, with all the hippies and drop-outs. But when they move to a cabin near hers, she becomes friends with them right away. I just thought it would've taken her much longer to even think of getting to know them. Otherwise I found the book well-written, often funny, and enjoyable.	2004-07-03

I liked the second one. This one? The book company must've made the author write a third one. It sounded like she ran out of steam, and her characters had become little more than stereotypes: the sassy African-American, the wry disabled woman (I was ready to strangle Phoebe with her loud-mouth remarks by the end of this book), the Southern belle who becomes nothing more than a lacquered Barbie doll in this offering (and Nance was so wonderful and realistic in the first). The author seemed to just throw in plot points: well, Beryl's relationship doesn't work out, it might be nice to bring in a Native American for a while, Phoebe should get a disabled boyfriend, how about one of the women gets sick, now? I was disappointed that a story of women's friendship that was so enjoyable at first ended on such a flat note, and I was tired of the author using her characters to push Christianity and vegetarianism. In this book it seemed that every second sentence had Ness or Nance talking about God or a vegetarian reminding someone else that Nance had given up meat. It's a shame that four such realistic, diverse characters ended up sounding like the same uninteresting woman.	2004-06-17

I appreciate any book that can inspire a reader to do that; the author has a very funny, succinct writing style. I also appreciate books about people who are other than \\"mainstream,\\" so I mostly enjoyed this one. However, as a heterosexual female, I didn't appreciate the writer's graphic descriptions of just what he likes (or liked as a teenager) to do with his male partners. When readers are trying to broaden their minds by choosing books about people not exactly like themselves, that kind of detail isn't what they're normally after. If this author has a second book, hopefully he's gotten that type of thing out of his system.	2004-05-15

It was surprising to discover that she was so innocent and sheltered when she started out in Hollywood, and to an extent continued to be once she became Humphrey Bogart's wife. I actually didn't expect so many pages about their privileged life full of upper crust friends (I got a bit tired of the name dropping). The description of Bogart's decline and death from cancer was harrowing. Bacall describes her work on Broadway in an interesting way. She was certainly less sure of herself, even into her 30s and 40s, than I ever expected. The book is certainly humanizing, and I admire the fact that she didn't mind that.	2004-02-07

She actually rehashes a lot of what she wrote in that book: her work on Broadway, people in her life, etc. I didn't necessarily mind that - I read this one directly after the other so it complemented it. I would've found it very slight by itself, though. In this one she also talks about putting together her dream home and finding it lacking, and about her grown kids and their lives, some other topics too.	2004-02-07
US	51281592	RWTTIW4EHKIG6	015101020X	133567778	The Fox's Walk	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Interesting and subtle	I enjoyed this book about the decline of Anglo-Irish society in Ireland during World War I although there was little dialogue and the author has a fondness for long run-on sentences using semicolons and dashes. These long sentences sometimes made the original thought hard to follow. I liked the main character, a little girl named Alice (narrating as a grown-up) who's left in the care of her genteel grandmother and great-aunt. Unsure of why she's been left, lonely, isolated, and given to sleep-walking, she still has a strong, observant character and develops a love for her new home. She worries about her future. It's made known that little Alice eventually marries a wild and rebellious local boy. I liked how that part of the story foreshadows Ireland's eventual revolution. After reading this book, I'd like to go on and read a history book about Ireland.	2004-01-10

It's the only book I've read about her so far, and I felt I received not only a satisfying glimpse of her personality but enough background to get a handle on the important moments of her career and private life (such as her relationships with Howard Hughes and Spencer Tracy). There were also fascinating glimpses of Michael Jackson (who has dinner with her, in one anecdote) and the monumentally egotistical Warren Beatty (who has the author convince her to appear in &quot;Love Affair&quot;). The only thing I found a bit strange about this book is that the author wrote a biography of an editor and mentions publishing and editing quite a bit - and this book has more than a few spelling and punctuation errors. I don't think it was a good idea to rush it to market. Otherwise, it's great. It was a refreshing and pleasant read.	2003-12-26

It's not just this reviewer who finds this character trying - question #9 in the readers' discussion guide in the back of the book starts: &quot;Some people find Winnie Rudge to be downright unlikable.&quot;<br />Some readers might like the challenge of figuring out Winnie and looking for her good side, but I didn't. I love Gregory Maguire's books for being unique and strange. This one was not strange in a good way. If you read it first of all his works, you'll probably never go on to the others. Still, I can't pan it completely. I kept returning to the book; you definitely wonder what's going to happen and how the story will end. Ultimately, there just wasn't enough of anything in the story - for example, you expect it to be a retelling of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; but that story is really barely mentioned. Also, you really have to suspend disbelief to buy into the ending and that just didn't seem to fit by the time you've read that far. Start with another of the author's works and you'll be much happier.	2003-12-14

He's very informative about Fleetwood Mac, the band with such a long history. Mick has a good sense of humor about himself and his weaknesses; he discusses bankruptcy, other legal problems, drinking and drug use, affairs, and all kinds of rowdiness with humor and (seemingly) nothing to hide. Admittedly I read this book because I'm more of a Stevie Nicks fan than a Fleetwood Mac muscial group fan - there's some good stuff about her, too, once the Mac is reinventing itself in California. Thumbs up for this book.	2003-12-14

It covers her life from childhood to death and discusses everything that seems important: her years starting out in modeling and show business in New York, moving to Los Angeles, meeting Desi, starting the show that became so famous, Desilu studios, the breakup with Desi, her later years. I would've liked to read more about her kids and her relationship with them, but it's her biography, not theirs, and maybe that kind of information isn't forthcoming to a biographer. I would've liked more photos, too. But I shut the book feeling that I've gotten a good solid basis for my Lucille Ball education. This seems like a good book from which to go on to others.	2003-12-01

Large color photos of Steve, Terri, their young daughter, some other family members and zoo crew, and many animals, of course. Chapters alternate between being written by Steve and Terri with the last chapter written by Wes Mannion, Australia zoo director and (as those who watch the shows know) Steve's best friend. It was nice to read about Steve's start with animals, also Terri's. Fans don't know a lot about her so it was interesting to hear about her background and read her anecdotes.<br />The problem is that this book is really quite short (written in large print) and there isn't that much here that you don't already know if you watch the shows. They repeat a lot of what you see and hear on the shows, but at the same time, they seem to assume that you watch them. That strange combination made for a slightly unsatisfying book. On TV and in print, Steve and Terri seem so perfect, matched perfectly, so good on camera, zoo managers without compare - it's like they're manufactured characters instead of real people. I was hoping this book would humanize them - I'd still love them if they showed their flaws and I'm sure so would their other fans. The book is good but it didn't let me feel that I cracked the Irwin facade. I guess we have to wait for a biography rather than autobiography for that.	2003-12-01
US	51281592	R2FSKXN7QH6NOO	006039384X	776351801	Mirror Mirror: A Novel	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Unique entertainment puzzling at times	I read all of this author's books and I saw the musical version of &quot;Wicked&quot; in San Francisco when it had its trial run. I enjoy his sly, witty and clever retellings of classic tales. This male author writes women quite well - he has a lot of female characters to deal with because woman are usually the ones having something done to them in fairy tales. I thought this book was very good; I looked forward to returning to it each day. I loved how he made &quot;the wicked stepmother&quot; Lucrezia Borgia (and not the stepmother at all). She doesn't just have things done to her but she DOES.<br />That being said, I was puzzled by the inclusion of the mysterious holy relic, the Apples of Eden. I understand he included this because in that period of history certain people were very interested in obtaining these types of relics, but what these Apples were doing to the dwarves and others who ate of them, and what exactly they did to Bianca (Snow White) - I didn't quite follow. I didn't quite follow what the dwarves were supposed to be like, either. At first they seem to be little more than stones; later they become more like humans. It's just a little puzzling that the author is making it a point to cast classic tales in a historical, believable light for adult readers, obviously researching the time period in detail and including real historical characters - then he puts in elements that aren't believable anyway. You're not sure how you're supposed to take what you're reading. At one point one of the dwarves is described as a headless stone dog and even Lucrezia Borgia doesn't blink an eye at his/its appearance. A bit puzzling. Still, better than the average read. I'll be back for the next one.	2003-11-19

He told me that it expressed what he felt when he paid his old home a visit a few years ago. I appreciated the author's words regarding the returning Czech immigrants in the book. They return home to a country that is much changed from what they remember. At least one of them realizes that he's been missing a country that no longer exists. Even his native language has come to sound strange to his ears. The reactions of other people in the book were interesting too - no one in the home country asks their returning friends or relatives about their lives in their adopted countries. I remember that same kind of strange silence when I visited Hungary with my family. The author's words ring extremely true. This isn't the type of book I normally read and I appreciated learning from the author's point of view. I had trouble distinguishing between his characters, though. They are not fleshed out, and the plot is slight. It's a book more about the feelings and observations of an emigrant/immigrant. That's very valuable, but I suspect the audience for the work is small. I definitely recommend the book.	2003-11-10

Maybe you have to read the other books to truly enjoy them. Poppy is supposed to be so admirable, being a spunky and independent disabled woman, but I would've enjoyed her more if it weren't made clear that her parents or mother had built her a specialized house and bought her a specialized van. How many other disabled people have these kinds of advantages? And her occupation is working the phone lines. It's made clear that people in her small town call her all the time to talk. To me, it sounds like she's a professional gossip. And her boyfriend Griffin is supposed to be so loving and accepting. Then why is such a big deal made about her putting on crutches and re-learning to walk? It ends up sounding like she had to seem more like a &quot;normal&quot; woman to truly be accepted, not just by him, but by the author and the readers. I think this is offensive to any disabled woman reading the story who doesn't have the option of walking using crutches.<br />And the part about Lisa/Heather and her silence about her past? I wanted to shout: just start talking for crying out loud! And her boyfriend at home, agonizing about opening her backpack, the one link to her past? Just open the darn thing!! These small town characters truly frustrated me. At the end of the book, I was glad to leave this stifling small town atmosphere. I always thought things would be better in a small town. If you end up meeting people like these, I'm not so darn sure.	2003-10-30

The president's daughter, Ashley, is supposed to be in her early twenties, a college student. At the beginning of the story, she's with her friends, and the way they talk to each other is extremely fake. What 20-something says things like, &quot;I have a hunch he would be all burnished muscle and sinewy strength.&quot; This girl had better be a straight-A English major (the author doesn't go into details on the friends). Ashley herself says things like, &quot;Oh, Nick, am I ever glad to see you!&quot; What is she, a damsel in distress from a silent film? And I hope that young people aren't reading this book to get ideas about sexual encounters, because when Nick, the Secret Service agent assigned to Ashley, sleeps with her and realizes that he forgot to use a condom, he hustles her into the shower with him. Oh, taking a shower after going to bed with someone prevents pregnancy? In what universe? And having Nick single-handedly rescue the entire First Family from terrorists - um, I need to read some non-fiction after this. I may never recover.	2003-09-28

There's also a section on baking. It's very straightforward and I understood more from the exceptionally realistic drawings describing step by step how to (for example) dice an onion than I did from the actual photographs in &quot;The Professional Chef&quot; which says a lot right there. Definitely buy this book.	2003-09-18

The widowed First Lady (Nealy), who continues to serve as the First Lady for the man who takes over for her dead husband, decides to escape the White House for an adventure. She ends up traveling across several states with a grouchy ex-journalist (Mat), a bratty teenager and a baby (the teen's little sister). I liked how the author switched perspective occasionally, so that in addition to getting the story from Nealy, you'd get it from the teen sometimes, sometimes from Mat. She switched to sounding like a teen or an adult male very well. I liked how she gave Mat a whole group of little sisters to explain his fear of commitment (he felt he'd had enough female influence in his life after raising his sisters). That was at least a unique explanation. There was just enough realism in the background (with the Secret Service agents, Nealy calling real-life First Ladies to check in, etc.) to make this story believable, as long as you read in the spirit of fun. The ending was fanciful, but enjoyable. I hope that we do see a female leader like Nealy someday. I wouldn't mind going on to read more by this author.	2003-09-15

Her books are strangely similar, with the Chinese mother, the Chinese-American (first generation) daughter, the San Francisco Bay Area settings, the complex relationship between the mother and daughter and the influence of the past (and sometimes past lives). It works, though - it's what I keep coming back for. It works because it almost seems like the same mother and daughter are being shown in different lives (her books often have such spiritual, mystical aspects that include past lives).<br />This book seemed the most touching, with some of the loveliest passages. Reading it, I got tears in my eyes several times. There was also some really good dark humor, such as when Ruth (the daughter) recalls trying to kill herself in various ways at the age of eleven when she thinks she's pregnant (while never having been with a man). It's wonderful how as an adult she learns about her mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. In learning her mother's story, she learns her own. Tan's books are wonderful even if you don't have an Asian background (you basically just need to have a mother). I always wished I could mention to this author that my own mother is from Hungary, and she is extremely similar to the Chinese mothers she writes about, and my relationship with her (because I'm a first generation American too) is similar. There isn't this spiritual, mystical, ghost and past life influence in Hungarian culture, but there is definitely the constant criticism from Mom, the high expectations, the complex relationship, the misunderstandings, the anger, the resentments - everything she writes about. Tan writes for all mothers and daughters. As many times as she writes these types of characters and this type of setting, I'll be there.	2003-09-06

I have to figure out where to buy the ingredients for several, though. The well-traveled author apparently loves to shop in gourmet import stores. I shop at the local supermarket so I'm sure I'm disadvantaged from her point of view. I enjoyed her introduction where someone finally put to print the fact that just because you live alone, it doesn't mean that you're not interested in cooking or eating well. Living alone doesn't mean that you don't DESERVE to eat well. There is a large population of people (27% percent of Americans as stated in the book) who live alone - it's time that cookbooks and other types of books addressed this fact (gosh I'm tired of cookbooks full of recipes for huge family portions). This is a lovely cookbook that finally addresses singles. My only problem is that it addresses the wealthy, upscale single. The author comes off sounding snobbish at times. But I'll go ahead and take that over another family cookbook or college dorm singles cookbook anytime.	2003-09-04

The pictures are lovely and the recipes printed in an attractive and easy to read format. None of them seem to be too complicated, and I have confidence that with practice, I'll be able to put these lovely egg-based foods on the table with great satisfaction. I want to read over the introductory sections which explain how to fold ingredients into an omelette and how to do the egg whites in a souffle correctly. Frittatas were new to me and I enjoyed learning how you brown the tops. This is a great book and I want to look for more by this author.	2003-09-04

At first Kwan, the older sister from China, embarrasses Olivia, who was born in the U.S. and is half-Chinese. When Kwan says she has &quot;yin eyes&quot; and can see ghosts, Olivia tells her mother and gets Kwan sent to a mental hospital for a time. Kwan never blames Olivia for this or for anything else - she loves her sister unconditionally. Because Kwan continues to be rather odd, it takes Olivia a long time to appreciate her love and attention. She even starts to come around to Kwan's belief in past lives, ones that continue to affect us in our present lives. A story that seems to be a fantasy of Kwan's takes on new meaning (both to Olivia and to the reader). I really enjoyed Olivia's acceptance of the past life story. It reinforces the fact that not everything in life can be explained away by reason and practicality. Our &quot;secret senses&quot; (what Westerners might call intuition) open us to other realities and other realms if we're willing to listen and believe. What a lovely novel.	2003-09-01

I was very excited to have a new book by her to read. I did enjoy this new story - she didn't disappoint with her interesting suspects, unusual locale (Guernsey), and attention-catching backstory of the siblings who lost everything in the Holocaust. I looked forward to getting back to the book each day and was actually sorry it was over. I thought her sort of circular storytelling was a good variation for her, something a little different in a mystery.<br />The thing was, I was sorry that her usual lead characters of Barbara Havers (whom I ADORE and who doesn't appear) and Inspector Lynley (who appears extremely briefly as Acting Superintendent) were not in the lead in this one. I try so hard to be interested in Deborah and Simon but I find them lukewarm characters. In this book it kept seeming like something fairly major was going to come of the discussion of Simon's disability and the age difference between the two, but nothing really did. Simon had a revelation about the way he treats Deborah (since he remembers her as a child and young adult whom he had to look out for) but..? That wasn't a very satisfying revelation. I enjoyed this book and there's much worse out there when it comes to what you can pick up to read, but I hope the next book will star Barbara again and be deeper and more tightly woven. Of all her mysteries I don't think the author has topped \\"Playing for the Ashes\\" yet and that's from years ago now.	2003-08-26

They seem satisfying and are done in enough of a gourmet style that you'll be proud of yourself at the next dinner party, but the recipes are not intimidating or difficult to make because of ingredients that seem impossible to find. I like that very much. I also like the bonus section which gives wonderful recipes (many quick and easy) for more traditional cooking (stovetop and oven). My concern is that I have a 3 quart slow cooker. The recipes list the size of slow cooker needed for each recipe (that's very clever) and the smallest listed is always 3 1/2 quart. Most recipes in this book are meant for much bigger slow cookers. So now I'll have to take my chances with my cooker, or scale down the recipes. Readers should just be aware that the authors had families in mind, not single people with small slow cookers. That's a bit irritating, I must say.	2003-08-21

I like the author's down-home, friendly style. The only problem is, her recipes are very down-home too - they almost seem outdated, as if they were created back in the slow cooker's original heyday, the 1970s or so (actually I think people ate more healthy than this in the 70s). Obviously the author and her family have no weight problems and can eat what they want. The recipes are hearty and easy, but be prepared for lots of full-fat ingredients and everything we're always renovating our recipes for nowadays. I flagged a lot of recipes in this book to make, but only as special treats. I couldn't use this book for daily meals.	2003-08-21

Even within the confines of these necessarily short romance books, authors can create good, memorable characters and write realistic, witty dialogue and good plots. This story, about a princess in a fictional country who runs away to avoid marrying an undesirable man whom she has to prove is a traitor to her country, had none of these positive things. I thought her bodyguard came off all right, but the princess herself sounded fake and stiff whenever she talked. I didn't particularly like her and that's not good when she's the lead character. It was kind of nice that she and her bodyguard got married for convenience and then fell in love for real (I like romance like that) but the whole story seemed like a fake prop for something (what, the rather explicit and not very romantic love scenes)? Just because I'm reading a formula romance doesn't mean I don't want a good story and good characters. I'll be donating this one to the library instead of keeping it.	2003-08-21

I did end up finding some of the early history of Mick Fleetwood/John McVie's band interesting and amusing (I didn't know Mick had worked as an interior decorator). There is some good information on Stevie Nicks once she and Lindsey Buckingham enter the picture, but it just whets your appetite. You groan because you want to know more, much more about the events described. You want the DISH and there's just a sort of genial, breezy narrative here.<br />I did like the British author's writing style (he was assocatied with the Mac in their earliest blues career). He has a good sense of humor, an amusing vocabulary (at one point he describes a friend of Stevie's being &quot;winched in&quot; to help with one of her albums) and doesn't take himself too seriously. That's refreshing because I'm sure that when the members of the Mac write their own stories, they will. I liked this book but I'm sure hard core fans, the ones I feel I'm constantly trying to catch up to, knew all this stuff ages ago.	2003-08-06
US	51281592	R20W3T6L7IVIAM	0671877216	683362821	One Foot in the Grave	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Great book with a curious ending	I also bought this book because of the new twist, &quot;Dracula Meets the Godfather&quot; (written on the cover). It truly was a pleasurable read. The main character, Chris, is very droll, wry, witty, sometimes sarcastic - everything I like in a lead. For quite a while it's kept a mystery a) what's wrong with him and then b) what happened to start him on the way to becoming a vampire. It's a refreshing twist that he isn't just turned into one and then goes on neck-biting power trip like in other stories I can think of. The theory explaining vampirism that's put forth in the book is also an original twist (you practically want to believe it).<br />I enjoyed that for most of the book, Chris is weirded out and skeptical of the people around him and of the changes in his body as a real person would be. At the same time, he keeps his sense of humor in a great way. The author keeps everything very rooted in the real world, very modern, with references to horror movies we've all seen, Anne Rice - even my favorite, &quot;Air Dracula&quot; (in reference to a running leap made by one of the vampires who's pivotal in the plot). Very funny stuff. <br />The only problem was, this refreshing rooted-in-reality aspect was lost toward the end. Suddenly there weren't just vampires and werewolves (that the author established very well by then - you practically expect them to be living next door) but zombies and a long dead creepy dating back to ancient Egypt. It was like the book suddenly took a turn into the campy horror that it was making fun of all along. I thought that was a curious way to end a book that was extremely well-written and refreshing otherwise.	2003-07-22

I'm enjoying the way Harry is developing and changing. In this book he often seems alone and confused, quite angry and proud. Who doesn't remember these feelings from the teen years. Of course, he's a teen born to fight evil. He has just a BIT more to handle than a common teen. This massive war between good and evil that the author is setting up is depressing, but it definitely keeps you wondering and guessing. Often you can't tell where she's going with a character, like Luna (in this book) who seems to be there to be laughed at - hopefully she'll come into her own like Neville. I really enjoy the way Neville is becoming important in the story. I enjoy Ron, too - I can picture him as a real person, and not because I've seen an actor play him in the movies. I like the way the author slips in someone new and interesting just when a character like that seems to be needed, like the sly Phineas Nigellus in this book. I love her complex adult characters like Snape, who's actually Harry's ally but an extremely unlikeable individual. Her truly unlikeable characters like Umbridge in this book truly make you suffer along with the kids. Rowling so often reminds us that adults can be truly cruel. Harry faces a lot of turmoil and continued loss, and we know that in the upcoming books he'll have to find even more reserves of strength. Life is definitely not easy in the Harry Potter books. I'll definitely be there for every part of Harry's story. I think I speak for many when I say I've really come to care about him. Bravo for another long but ultimately rich, thought-provoking segment of the story.	2003-07-18

Well, I didn't find anything witty or sly about it - nothing particularly original, either. The author took her wishful re-write dead seriously. What we find out is that slaves were secretly behind everything, running everything, killing people when they thought it was necessary, and in fact they are related to all the rich whites and all the rich whites are related to them. That's the big original idea that called for a re-write? Everyone is sleeping with everyone else and the lead character survives by being a rich man's mistress (guess which man). This is the big revelation? You don't know what a relief it was to reach the end of this distasteful story. It was small consolation that the lead character finally, at the very end, decides to stand on her own two feet and do something that isn't directly related to the white people in her life (although the money she uses is still theirs, indirectly). The big revelation of this novel is that the black people were obsessed with what the white people around them had, and would do anything they could to get it and control it? And by the way, it was never clear why the lead character's voice is so eloquent at times and full of slang at others. I'm going back to watching the original overblown melodrama. It'll be a relief after this.	2003-07-18

I doubt you can find more detailed background data about Lucille Ball's work (from the beginning of her career to the end, from stage to the big and small screens) and her (lesser known) co-stars and co-workers anywhere else. The problem is, I'm a new fan to Lucy and I wanted to read about her life in a more conventional way (where she was born, raised, her influences, her marriage, children, etc). Those types of books got such mixed reviews from fans that I thought I'd start with this one, which had only positive reviews. There is some basic bio in this book, but it assumes you know that type of information about Lucy. So I would just say: make sure you don't start with this book if you're a new fan. It's like getting to know her backwards (everyone around her instead of the star herself). This is definitely a book for seasoned fans who want to know &quot;more.&quot;	2003-06-25

It was atmospheric and I felt I had had an adventure when finished. The story stays with you. But I also felt like I'd read the Cliff Notes to the book. I felt like I was ready to move on to the &quot;real&quot; story. With many of the characters, I wondered who these people were and why they were doing what they were doing. Yes, the story is from a child's point of view, but having characters drift in and out, be troubled and do strange things without explanation was curious and unsatisfying. Perhaps you need to know the author's background to fully enjoy the sparsely filled-out story. I didn't know, and I was left a little dissatisfied because of this.	2003-06-15

I'm biased because my father is from Hungary and is of the exact same generation; he even had experiences similar to Mr. Grove's, going to preparatory high school, university, getting caught up in the Hungarian Revolution and escaping in the middle of the night to Austria. How wonderful to have some of the history and experiences of the times described in such an accessible way. The story is clear and straightforward and yet extremely moving, almost haunting. I loved how the title becomes clear when you read the book (an allusion to swimming across the lake of life and how not everyone makes it to the other side). How glad I am that Mr. Grove made it (across the Atlantic, at any rate) and wrote such a lovely book. It means a lot to at least one daughter of a Hungarian immigrant.	2003-06-15

Accountant Frederick Stone (even the well-chosen name makes him sound stuffy) has the life that he takes for granted come tumbling down around him when his free-spirited wife walks out on him. Suddenly he's receiving his first traffic ticket, falling from a roof when he's trying to spy on his soon-to-be-ex wife, beating up an &quot;intruder&quot; who turns out to be a relative, and having his bare rump photographed by a private detective when a local rich woman throws herself on him. In between these capers, he's learning about himself and about growing older, about dreams that don't come true, about adjustments we all have to make as we get older, about many, many insightful and touching things. This is a wonderfully written book, a true pleasure, and I recommend it to readers of all ages.	2003-06-08

I enjoyed reading the summaries of each episode and the specials, since I'm not at the level of fandom where I've seen every one. I also enjoyed reading about the museum, which I hope to visit one day. The only drawbacks are that I would've liked to have more included about the cast (the glimpses of them as they were when they were hired was the best part of the beginning of the book). I wished there were more quotes from the actors (there are some accompanying the episode summaries). I wished there could've been photos of them today (when the book was published) and more about their lives post-&quot;Waltons.&quot; Also, it upsets me that you can't look up the shows by title in the index. If you're watching one in syndication on TV and you try to look it up, you have to page through the episodes section (and there were nine seasons)! This is a lovely book but it feels like it was put together a little hastily. Improvements could've been made.	2003-06-08

I read this book because I like &quot;bodyguard&quot; stories (usually I read them from the romance section). I enjoyed the deteriorating high tech world (and solar system) that this author created. It sounded suspiciously familiar, as if it's truly just around the corner for Earth in real life. And the bodyguard, Max, was a pleasant surprise. As a &quot;chrome dome&quot; who'd undergone brain surgery that he doesn't remember, suffering brain damage of unknown origin, he was surprisingly self-effacing and humorous. The book is a real page-turner because you're so willing to follow Max wherever he goes. And I enjoyed the little twist in the story concerning the young woman he's guarding, a protectee who's curiously able to defend herself. I hope this author has this turned into a movie soon!	2003-05-21

I was surprised when death entered the plot and stayed there. I felt a bit fooled by the dust jacket, actually. But the story was lovely. The author's writing style is so gentle and flowing. She makes me want to live in a small town in Maine in the worst way. This story is told by a man, Sam, working as a vet in his small home town. His first love, a free spirit named Dee Dee, unexpectedly returns to town with her young son. She and her son become an integral part of Sam's life again, and the life of his wife. Dee Dee makes candles for a living - I loved this aspect. This book tells a melancholy but sweet story. After being initially surprised by it, I would definitely recommend it. I went on to buy more by this author once I started it.	2003-05-16

The exams are full of mathematics (even if the job has nothing to do with that subject). I needed a math refresher course in the worst way when I realized that I'd forgotten my long division and multiplication, the more difficult stretches of the multiplication table, percentages, and anything to do with fractions. This book teaches you these things (and much more) in a very nice, courteous, non-intimidating, non-condescending manner. I really appreciate it. I don't want to become a mathematician. I just want to recall enough to get by. Thank goodness this book helps you do that. I definitely recommend it. I bought it together with a similar refresher math book and found out that this one is the only one you really need.	2003-05-16

Mary Meigs Atwater was the Dean of American Handweaving so Interweave Press reprinted her only published novel (it has nothing to do with weaving, though). While often sounding quite dated (including the sexist references to women despite the female author), the book actually seems quite modern in some aspects. There is a sly, wicked tone describing how the murder (or disappearance because the body is never found) of a small town man changes the town. People descend on the town, money is spent, people who would never have otherwise come in contact meet each other, a love affair is renewed, etc. In addition, \\"modern\\" aspects of living such as abortion are included (while the word is never actually used). I enjoyed the author's descriptions of a very, very hot summer, the corn growing all around this small town in the heat. You really had a sense of oppression and of things baking in this heat, coming to a head. This mystery features a twist that isn't really my cup of tea - the murderer is never revealed directly. You have to make your best guest using what clues there are throughout the book and at the end. While I wouldn't keep this book in my collection to read over again, I would still describe it as an enjoyable read. Pick it up if you want something different for your mystery reading.	2003-05-15

It reminds us that we deserve to be fully alive even as we get older, even when we think we have to be held back because we are role models to younger people, to our children. I enjoyed the story and I'm not in that age range (I'm much younger). While the author sometimes stopped me with her writing style (I would've been marked down in college for using some of the grammar and punctuation that she did), her overall style is gentle, flowing. It makes for a sweet story, a relaxing read. I've already sought out other books by her.	2003-05-01

It was nice to listen to the witty and sometimes biting &quot;voice&quot; of an author close to my own age, and meet a character who represents the non-size-zero single career woman. On the whole the book was a completely pleasant read, one I welcomed returning to each day. That being said, I thought some parts of the storyline were too fanciful, and at the same time, didn't get the full attention that the reader expected. For example (trying to avoid spoilers) what happened with the screenplay and how neatly everything was wrapped up for Cannie (the lead character) by the end. I was happy for the character, but I didn't believe in what happened. Still, I look forward to reading this author's second book.	2003-04-11

While I normally would've been anything but interested in a woman who spent so many years in beauty pageants, I've always liked this actress. She was talented and hilarious on &quot;Designing Women,&quot; and there was always something about her that let you know she was interesting, quirky, good-hearted, and  strong. (She herself says she always knew pageants were a means to an end.) I was one of the people who sent her a letter of support when that ridiculous obession with her weight gain began. (And she sent back a lovely card of thanks.) Delta sort of had to go through it for all of us full-figured women first - through her experience, the media and U.S. as a whole seemed to realize for the first time that most women in this country are not a Hollywood size 0 (duh). I appreciate how she stuck out the difficult times and has stayed a beautiful person. Her book was a great mix of autobiography and style, makeup and clothing tips. I read it just after reading Carnie Wilson's homage to getting drastic surgery as a way to slim down, and while I realize that Delta was never as dangerously heavy as Carnie, it's such a relief to read about a full-figured woman who accepts herself as she is and is helping others do the same. Go Delta!	2003-03-17

It was written in a very accessible style, and I enjoyed the author's sense of humor. The book was well-divided into sections: games and humor; trade and barter; deception; mind reading and mental chess; cooperation in work, conflict and healing; tools and intelligence; escapes; empathy and heroism; and a place where humans are the novelty. I would've liked to have read more about the last section, about animals who have no fear of humans in a virtually untouched jungle in Africa. The only thing that puzzled me about the book was the rather apologetic tone regarding animal intelligence. The tone tries to pacify scientists and other people who aren't convinced that animals possess intelligence. I have never doubted that they do. I'm sure most people who have pets or work around animals feel the same way. It's too bad that we have to be apologetic about believing that the important life forms that share our planet have the capacity to think and feel. As the author points out in the last chapter, based on what we're doing to the planet, it's sometimes questionable which species is really the one without intelligence.	2003-03-13

She sets down a lot of truth about why people overeat and how it feels to be overweight. If you're an overweight person, you can really relate, even if you don't share her background. It bothers me a little that she became such an advocate for weight loss surgery, though. I am currently on my weight loss journey through a program, not through surgery. As she herself points out, even after gastric bypass surgery, people have to learn to eat in a healthy way and in moderation. It's good that she's a very open person, very truthful, and her use of profanity didn't bother me like it did some other reviewers - she should communicate in a book like she communicates in real life, and she obviously isn't a person who holds back. I'm glad she found such happiness with her husband (she talks a lot about meeting him and being with him), but at times I was wondering why I was reading this book about a famous singer's daughter who mostly became famous through her weight trials (I didn't listen to Wilson Phillips and I didn't watch Carnie's talk show, but I sure saw her all over the media because of her weight). I guess someone had to be the &quot;face&quot; of gastric bypass. It's a good thing someone as open and bold and truthful and full of personality as she was the one - I think.	2003-03-11

I enjoyed how they marry for convenience and safety and their love develops later. The mystery in the background of the story, which provides the tension and keeps Tessa in danger, was interesting, and a different twist for a romance. It wasn't clear to me if this book was part of a series or an independent title, but it stood well on its own. I will definitely be looking for more by this author.

There certainly are a lot of riddles in here, and the index is very helpful so you can find ones on certain topics, but many of the riddles sound old-fashioned, like they were from the 1960s or so. I assume kids are the ones using this book the most, and I can't imagine that they relate to many of these riddles. Also, many of the riddles are only lukewarm (not that witty or funny).

It was a wonderful, quick way to learn about the young royal who would become Queen Elizabeth I. It becomes so much easier to remember her relations to other royals and what happened in her life when they appear as characters and situations in a fast-moving story. Her sister Queen Mary really comes to life, for example. The historical setting was brought to life beautifully as well - for example, the way the royals had to keep moving from one household to another because the houses would become too filthy to keep living in. It's easy for us to forget in modern times what life was like so long ago, even for a princess. It's one thing if a textbook tells you; it's another when it's part of a fiction setting.

That was a nice twist. This is actually one of a series, but I understood the story without having read the others. I liked the back story of the bodyguard, why she chose that line of work and why she's so afraid to commit in a relationship. She's brought back together with the baron because he has amnesia and wants to re-create their romance in order to spark his memory. What a nice idea - re-creating all the high points of a relationship that didn't originally last, having a chance to make things right. This was a unique romance book plot to me. I really appreciated it. I definitely recommend this one.	2002-12-27

I tried very hard to like this book; the author seems so knowledgeable and pleasant, and I love the idea of this series, one book for each sabbat. But this is the first book I can remember that has both not enough information and too much. The author assumes one knows traditional pagan mythology such as the defeat of the holly king, so she doesn't retell the tale. It would've been nice to have a beautiful retelling and a section about this myth. At the same time, she goes on and on with craft projects, as if what the modern pagan is missing from her life is another way to create a wreath. When she writes charms, her rhymes seem painfully forced to me. And it doesn't do me much good to have an author say: this is what I do with my family to celebrate the holiday - do whatever you want. I finished this book with a feeling of dissatisfaction and vague confusion. I expected better than this.	2002-12-16

It's been several years since I read this book, but I wanted to add my positive review to the others because it just can't be praised enough. I also picked up this book just by browsing in the romance section of a bookstore. It's magic when you pick one up almost by accident and it starts you on an incredible journey. This story about a woman who goes back in time to a dangerous period in Scotland and not only falls in love but has her own adventure - it was so absorbing and so well-written, with characters who felt so absolutely real, it made me feel like I was there. I didn't want to put the book down. I found myself going out at night to a bookstore open late so I could pick up the sequel. I ended up missing an appointment reading, because I couldn't put the books down. I do have to say I thought the series started to run out of steam by the fourth book, but that doesn't take away the magic of the first. Read it. You won't be disappointed. It'll be one of the few books in life that you'll retain almost scene by scene.	2002-12-09

I liked the format, each chapter beginning with a myth starring a heroine Goddess and then continuing with complementary activities and explanations that let the reader explore her spirituality and empower herself, either working by herself or with other young women. The book concludes with a description of the Maiden/Mother MoonCircle, an example of a mother/daughter circle that readers can use to create their own circles. Imagine mothers and daughters, or teen girls, working together to explore their spirituality, creativity, divinity, and empowerment. The world will be a better place. I'm so happy that books like this are coming out for young women today. You can't go wrong with Patricia Monaghan.	2002-12-03

She includes many useful and meaningful meditations, working with Goddesses, as well as introductions to numerology and astrology. She also has  information about herbs and color magick. I especially enjoyed her chapter called \\"Woman's Magic in Spirals and Cycles.\\" I liked how she articulated her belief about life and evolving consciousness moving and growing in a spiral fashion. She is a very good writer, and it was interesting to get a Brit's view of women's magic as a change from American writers' views. Her chapters are: woman's magic in sexuality, at home, in the garden,  concerning special occassions, in spirals and cycles, concerning the goddess, and concerning the sisterhood. This book doesn't really go in depth about these important concepts, but it is definitely a terrific introduction. Don't miss it.	2002-11-19

The four stories are enjoyable, although I personally found \\"Sinfully Scottish,\\" about a devilish  and manipulative millionaire, much too fake and saccharine for my taste. My favorite was \\"Lassie, Go Home,\\" which had a fun and spunky heroine. All of the stories have an American woman visiting Scotland, meeting a sexy Scot, and deciding to stay. It's a fantasy a lot of us enjoy, and who can beat the settings that always involve a castle? I don't think I'll be rereading these stories, but they were definitely a nice diversion, like a dip in a cool stream on a hot day.	2002-11-14

Do that. Do it like this. It was so completely refreshing to find a book that isn't a \\"how to,\\" but simply the story of an intelligent, professional woman's journey to the Goddess. In the book, the author is a big-time New York City lawyer in the music business, running the rat race as fast as she can and enduring the daily battle of sex discrimination. She begins her journey, joining a women's circle and learning about Wicca starting with the very basics. She doesn't hold her experience up as an example to follow; she simply explains who she is (was), what happened to her, and what she discovered, and she explains it beautifully. She addresses a lot of the questions and reservations a thinking person has when starting on the pagan path. I recommend this book for anyone starting the path, for anyone in your life wondering why you've chosen it, or anyone else, for that matter. It's a truly lovely, sensitive, intelligent, and refreshing read.	2002-10-24

It did have a style that seemed old-fashioned, with long descriptions of places and little dialogue, but I don't think that's surprising from an author who was an academic who specialized in history. As a Californian, I wasn't taught anything about Australia - I have to find the information myself, and this book was a beautiful beginning, taking me from the Outback to the city. The author does include a great deal about her mother (her mother's deterioration) and her own reaction to it. She eventually leaves for the U.S. for good (largely) because of her. Why should it be unusual for her to include this? This is not just a story about Australia, but about a daughter's relationship with her mother. She spoke her truth; more power to her. I'm also female - I have a complex relationship with my own difficult mother, and I saw myself in this story, even though it's from another place and a different generation. You can't write a memoir without discussing your family; they help shape who you are. Much of the time, our greatest courage comes from reacting to the expectations of our parents. Jill Ker Conway's reaction is a pleasure, a truly enlightening read.	2002-10-21

This is truly a lovely kit containing mini incense sticks, a Goddess figurine (which can hold the incense), a workable altar, and a petite book which lists a Goddess and an inspirational paragraph relating to her and to using her energies in your life for each day of the year. I love day-by-day Goddess books; because I'd gone through my other ones, I was so happy to find a new one. I find the figurine and the meditations in the book truly beautiful, calming and inspirational. The kit is definitely worth five stars, but I do have a complaint: I find it too messy to actually use the incense with the Goddess figurine. She &quot;holds&quot; it upright, and although she has a little bowl to catch the ashes, it's so small that in reality the ashes scatter everywhere. Buyers of this kit might want to have a separate mini-incense burner to use, like I do (or just use incense of regular length separately).	2002-10-14

Marie Browning is my personal soap-making Goddess. Her books are easy to follow, enjoyable, and full of wonderful soap pictures and recipes. This lovely book, good enough to browse as a soap art book if you don't want to make your own, features these sections: introduction, soap-making supplies, basic technique, designer techniques, the recipes, and metric conversion. There are several recipes to a page and the soaps are illustrated in color. What more could a crafter ask for? There are soaps for every level, and she explains what base to use, how many drops of  which fragrances, how many drops of which colorants, what molds to use, and any additional supplies. I look forward to trying each and every one of her designs! (Her dip-dot painted soaps are a special treat!)	2002-09-26

This is a great book providing an introduction to Dianic Wicca. It definitely deserved to remain in print. The author is a very knowledgeable, intelligent writer. Sections are: Dianic theology, ethics, magic, the cauldron and the tools, forming a group, ritual construction, and the rituals. This book is basically all you need to form a new group of Dianic practitioners. Even if you don't want to do this, perhaps simply learn more about the Goddess (as I did), it is still very valuable. You could adapt the rituals for Solitary use. I especially liked her ritual for Beltaine (The Red Ritual) which I will adapt for celebrating the beginning of my monthly cycle, each month.<br />My only complaint about the book is that the author is awfully earnest, to the point of needing a sense of humor sometimes. So much earnestness comes across as bossiness sometimes. And for many of the rituals, I couldn't picture myself actually doing those actions. You would need to be a very close-knit, trusting, and open group of women to do some of the performance art (my description) described in some of the rituals. But better performance art than something vague and boring. Definitely buy this book to add to your Wicca library.	2002-09-22

The author turned me off this book in the first few pages, when the lead character, Lili, reacts to the stress of an attempted kidnapping by coming on to her brand new bodyguard, rubbing her body against his to see if he'll react. Excuse me? All I could think was: what kind of promiscuous idiot does that? Throughout the rest of the book, I couldn't shake the feeling of being sorry for the bodyguard, Matt, for ending up with her. I don't think this author writes women well. Her character Matt was okay, but Lili? Even after this beginning, when things could only get better, you never really get a feel for her. And even when the author writes from a woman's point of view, she sounds like a man. Hint: when writing a romance, don't describe the blunt physicality of making love. This book was vaguely interesting because of the bit of mystery involving gangsters and a collectible pair of shoes (that's unique) but the romance? 373 pages and I'm sure glad it's over.	2002-09-12

I didn't know anything about this story or author when I picked up this book; I just wanted to read it because I grew up in Sunnyvale (and still live in the Bay Area). I found that the story moves along quietly and rather gently while describing serious subject matter: a family is broken apart by divorce. Meanwhile, the vast promise of the Silicon Valley is the background. It was a very honest portrayal of life and troubles in this area, very authentic to me: my father was an immigrant, drawn to California and the Bay Area as the promised land, and he was very much like the men in this book, wanting success, to make something of himself, expecting the best from his children, pressuring them to succeed because how can you possibly fail when you live in an Eichler home in a place called Sunnyvale in the place that created the technological revolution? Like the author himself, I was not the least bit drawn to the computer industry, wanting instead to be artistic and creative. Therefore, I never belonging here. I've been trying to get out of this area for years; in the book, the lead character/author moves to New York. I never realized that those of us who grew up in Sunnyvale could have similar life experiences despite differences in ethnicity, family background, etc. Your hometown influences you and your family and every part of your life. How nice to read a book that illustrates this so effectively.	2002-09-09

I admire the author for writing this story about a girl (later young woman) who is doing the best she can to cope with a mentally ill family member (her older sister) and the parents who are exhausted and preoccupied with taking care of her. I also have a mentally ill sister, and you don't know what a relief it was to me to realize that my response to the situation was shared by someone else: dreaming up a vivid fantasy life, becoming very creative as an outlet to explore my feelings & who I am (Lorna acts & writes poetry - I had dreams of acting & I write short stories). This was also the first time I heard anyone articulate how I've felt about drugs & alcohol (what her friends experiment with in the novel). When you grow up with so much imbalance in your life, dealing with a mentally ill person, the last thing you need is to do something that unbalances your mind. Few people understand that. Also, when Lorna goes to college, she has a sort of breakdown - the same thing happened to me. With the stress of college, other pressures come to a head. It was so nice to find an author who set all this down on paper. However, I couldn't give the book five stars because I did think some plot points went on and on (such as Lorna's obsession with her first boyfriend after he went away & stopped communicating with her). Also, some things are not explained well or you're not sure how to take them (as other reviewers point out). I found Lorna's visit with the lawyer/psychiatrist (?) disturbing, for example. I found the plotting flawed, but the book to be overall an excellent effort from someone who's been there.	2002-08-27

In this book, a petite, likeable, spirited heiress ends up on an adventure with a dark, sometimes cynical bodyguard. An interesting twist is that he IS her bodyguard, but she doesn't know that (he was hired by her brother to watch her surreptitiously). Then, she ends up HIRING him as her bodyguard. That's a cute twist. I like romances, but I find it hard to actually get through most of them because I studied English literature so my curse is to be able to recognize bad writing when I read it. This romance was a surprising pleasure: well-written with genuine originality and humor. The author's real enjoyment of writing and of her characters comes through in every page. I can't say it enough: it was a real pleasure. Don't miss this one.	2002-08-18

Yes, it's true that it might not have been entirely realistic for a middle class journalist to go \\"undercover\\" as a minimum wage worker (waitress, cleaner,...), with a wealthy life to fall back on, but the author never pretends that her experience is Genuine with a capital G. She wanted to show others of her class and those above it what life is like for the people they normally do not think about. She didn't fail at this. At my job sitting at a desk, I face boredom, weight gain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and getting chilled by too much air conditioning. If I find myself in dire financial trouble, it'll likely be through overspending on my credit cards. The women in this book faced homelessness, malnutrition, and illness because of lack of health care. Suddenly, my life and job looked like paradise to be appreciated. If a book made me take a look at what I had and made me really think about what other women didn't, it was worthwhile.	2002-08-09

This book is excellent for a look at the time of Henry VIII through the eyes of his daughter, Mary Tudor, when she is a girl and a teen. It is also a story that illustrates the horror of being a woman in a time of deep-seated, full-blown patriarchy. Mary is a princess, seemingly with all the advantages of life, but in reality she has nothing: no power to feed or clothe herself, find a place to live, find an occupation, or find love without the approval of her father the king, or another powerful man.<br />One of her high-born ladies-in-waiting says, \\"Have you not wondered why so many women are happy to shut themselves up in a convent? It is because they are safe there from the demands of cruel fathers and husbands.\\" This same woman's father later screams at her, \\"Do you not understand that I have the power of life and death over you?\\" The women themselves are not immune to the poisoned thinking of patriarchy: everyone believes that Anne Boleyn is a witch, a sorceress who has \\"bewitched\\" the king into ruining his first family and overspending and other crazy behaviors. Perhaps she wasn't a woman of admirable character, but it's as if the king had no free will of his own to begin behaving in this way.<br />This book will let all young ladies be deeply grateful that they weren't born in the 16th century. The life of a princess was nothing to be desired. This was an engrossing read but I was glad to put the book down at the end of the story and leave Mary's world.	2002-08-04

I also read this book because of the Stevie Nicks, \\"Rhiannon\\" connection, but fans like me might continue to enjoy the song more without reading this book, which certainly uses a dark interpretation of Goddesses in Celtic mythology. I believe Ms. Nicks focused on a very small part of the story, a love aspect, when she wrote the song. The book seems to suffer from a 1970s vogue for the idea of demonic possession (in fact, my yellowed copy says \\"For the millions of readers who enjoyed 'The Exorcist!'\\") That's not to say it isn't an engrossing read, and quite chilling in parts, and well-written. You won't like it if you expect a happy ending, but the ending is definitely thought-provoking. The jumping off place for the plot is: what's happening to this woman (Branwen)? (Who had a part in the death of her cousin Rhiannon when both were children.) Does she have multiple personalities, or is she mentally ill, or is she possessed by a ghost? The author does keep you guessing. Still, ultimately I would say that this book belongs back in the era in which it was written: the 1970s. \\"Rhiannon\\" the song has outlasted it by decades, for a reason!	2002-07-27

The story is about a young mermaid, Sirena, who wants to find a love that is true, not one that is formed because of her mesmerizing, enchanting singing. It was sort of deceptively simply written - very clear, very easy to read, but by no means simplistic. The straightforward style was so unexpected and refreshing when the tale was so much in the realm of fantasy and classical mythology. The result was that the world of gods, goddesses, mystical creatures and heroes was entirely believable. The hero she falls in love with, Philoctetes, was warm, humorous and down-to-earth, and you really felt for the lovely, melancholy, intelligent Sirena and understood how she was feeling.<br />Ultimately I thought this story was about finding love even if you are \\"different.\\" Sirena is afraid that her mermaid's tail will repulse Philoctetes, but she ultimately finds out otherwise. What a lovely message about acceptance of yourself and others, and of hope. Don't miss this one.	2002-07-24

I was under the impression this book was going to be hilarious, but I actually found it to be quite dark and depressing. That's because to me, the still-single 30-something (and then 40-something) character with the hyper-critical, absolutely unhelpful parents is all too familiar to me. The author really set down a realistic picture of a woman's single life. I especially liked the &quot;dumb girl&quot; inside the lead character, that little voice that keeps egging on an otherwise smart and successful woman to find a man, to date men she's not attracted to, to make the best of a bad relationship because of this idea that we're all supposed to be with someone - anyone. Because maybe the &quot;illusion of progress is as good as progress&quot; (a concept introduced by the character's mother). And the birthdays - it was a relief to find an author who understands the strength a person needs to keep smiling when she's in her 30s and spending her birthdays with two clueless parents who wonder why you're not married while they're sitting there arguing and being completely loveless. Yikes. This book gave me the chills! Single women - it's not that funny, but that's the beauty of it.	2002-07-07

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and also found it educational. I live in California, but I didn't know what was going on in the northern part, with the logging. The author introduced me to this problem in a warm, honest, educated way. She has a lovely style for someone so young, and an admirable sense of herself. I admire her tenacity, courage, and her willingness to take on the responsibility of becoming a public spokesperson. She didn't know what she would have to take on when she started her tree-sit. I loved how her book showed that sometimes you don't plan your life - your role in life finds you. It's your choice to accept what it offers.

I found this story about a college student, Nanny, working part-time (almost full-time because of her self-centered rich employer) as a nanny (what else?) refreshing and witty...and positively chilling when the rich employer, Mrs. X, behaves like Nanny is a used Kleenex worthy only of discarding, giving no thought to her (Mrs. X's own) four-year-old son, depriving Nanny of proper pay, treating her with coldness, derision and cruelty - why? Because she can. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area where there are plenty of &quot;exclusive&quot; communities and you encounter the &quot;I own the world&quot; attitudes of the wealthy on a daily basis (especially on the roads when they're in their Mercedes SUVs and other road toys). I fully believe this type of thing is going on in the homes of the wealthy here, too - you don't have to be in New York. Woe to the kids - they really need to be &quot;rooted for&quot; (as in the book). Bravo to the authors for exposing this type of situation in a readable and digestible way.

I read this book at 32, after seeing an ad for the series in a magazine for school library professionals, and I really enjoyed it. The author treated the high school scene (which hasn't changed much since my day except for the odd henna tattoo and body piercing) with knowledge, realism, and sensitivity. I liked her mix of characters who come together to learn about Wicca. Her lead male character, Cal, who is a witch, is sweet, smart, and believable, and I related to her lead female character, Morgan, who learns to recognize her inner power. I felt Wicca was portrayed positively and realistically, and so was the family scene (with Morgan having a lesbian aunt). The teen books from MY teens years seemed to ignore facts of life like that one. The author picked up on the similarity between realizing you're a witch and realizing you're gay. They don't call it \\"coming out of the broom closet\\" for nothing. We're not all the same, people, made from the same mold and destined to follow the same path, and enlightened teens who understand this will appreciate this book. Bravo to a great author.

I found the writer's style to be lovely, almost poetic at times. I appreciated the fact that the main character had some problems in her life (like her absent mother) but she had people to care for her, and she works through problems and comes out all right. The ghost story aspect was never used solely for scares or horror. It's a great read and at the same time, a story that stays with you. That's not something that can be said about all \\"ghost\\" books. Thank you, Ms. Conrad.	2002-05-22

It never occured to me that someone would write a book like this, going in-depth on a certain movie, until I just happened to see it on a &quot;new releases&quot; table at the bookstore. I had to buy it to read about one of my favorite movies, and I wasn't disappointed. I greatly enjoyed the author's funny, witty, intelligent writing. I found the book to be a real page-turner, even in sections where I didn't have a great deal of prior interest in the celebrity he was talking about.<br />The only place I disagreed with the author was when he asserted that Petula Clark didn't make a good Norma Desmond (in the musical). I came to the movie backwards - first, I heard about the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and wanted to see it. The only version available in San Francisco was the one with Ms. Clark. I thought she was wonderful - her voice has a little girl quality that really made you believe that Norma was stuck in the past, in her younger years when she was &quot;big&quot; in pictures. When I later heard Glenn Close play Norma and saw her in clips, I thought she sounded way too assertive, like a real ball-breaker. You had less  sympathy for her. So, consider, Mr. Staggs - if I'd never seen Petula Clark play Norma, I would never have bought the video and watched the original movie! I would never have enjoyed it enough to want to buy an in-depth book about it!<br />At any rate - great book. It's the entire back story (and forward story) of the movie, from conception to public response and the effect the movie had on the stars and director (and others). I especially enjoyed the interviews with the stars who are still with us, and the sections discussing the musical. It was refreshing to read a book written by someone who obviously cares deeply for the movie. I really enjoyed the fact that the writing style was chatty (yet intelligent) and not dry and scholarly.	2002-05-08

The illustrations were great. The basics of soap crafting were presented. What I liked most of all was the author's love for this particular craft coming through clearly. With some other soapmaking books, I learned but I didn't really start to think about creating new soap designs. I felt this author was sharing her works and encouraging me to try my own. She was positively infectious. I really appreciated that. I wrote down ideas for no less than five new soap designs while I was reading the last part of her book. I say, thanks Ms. Westerman! This is just the type of book we need.	2002-04-28

This is just the type of soap I want to make - I get exhausted by the &quot;lye people,&quot; the &quot;cold process&quot; people who often write negative reviews for books like these. Hasn't it ever occured to them that some of us live in apartments without a yard to work with lye, a hazardous ingredient? I purchase my soap base and melt it, and I can be just as creative as other soapmakers with the finished product. This book taught me about basics and about color, scent, special ingredients, and the final presentation. It was fun and informative, written by a creative author who obviously enjoys her own melt &amp; pour soapmaking. Hurray!	2002-04-24

I'd read anything she saw fit to put Barbara Havers in. I thought this one was a great read, not too long for me - I read it in a couple of days. But I guessed the culprit early on, and since I rarely guess (or particularly want to), I was slightly disappointed because of that! I both loved and hated the ambiguous ending, as well. Very clever to keep us guessing!	2002-03-25
US	51281592	RXHG0JFUGHWFP	0380790947	986179021	The Passion	Books	2	8	10	N	N	A disappointment.	I tried very hard to like this book, and even tried some of the sequel, but every time the plot started to go somewhere, the author would interrupt with long passages about how stupid, inferior, smelly, etc. humans are (to the oh so superior werewolves, of course). Does she expect werewolves to be reading this book? Or human haters? It was extremely tiring. Plus I feel she should've researched Anne Rice a little less before starting her books. She could've at least set her story in a different time period and location (Paris, always Paris). She does move the story to Alaska, finally, and the book really picks up when a werewolf and a human are thrown into an ordeal together. It was such a relief to finally get out of Paris and to have a real story begin, instead of narrative about how awful humans are.	2001-12-24

US	51281592	R5X93CV1K8DJL	0553502565	997866733	Winter Solstice	Books	4	3	3	N	N	So comfortable.	Listening to the audiotape of this Rosamunde Pilcher book is like sitting down by the fire for a comforting hot cup of tea. And that's saying a lot because I listened to it over several weeks in my car during my commute. Her descriptions really give you a sense of place, and you really come to know her characters. Her world becomes so familiar, you're happy to be able to visit again and again, even if you're on the freeway in California and she's describing rainy Scotland. The only drawback of this audiotape for me was the narrator. She can have an awfully assertive style sometimes. I really don't think the characters were being as assertive as she was, half the time. But that doesn't take away from the story. Little could.	2001-10-02

I never wanted the story to end, and to this day, almost ten years after my first reading, I still picture so many of the scenes. It is an awesome story driven by brilliant female characters, a beautiful saga filled with spirituality. Just thinking about this book brings back that wonderful, contented feeling I had while I was reading it. Marion Zimmer Bradley, wherever you are now, blessed be.	2001-07-24

I thought I would be getting a book filled with full color photographs of the embroidery and a great deal of text. But there's little text and every single picture is done in artwork. This would be very nice, except the artwork is not photo-realistic so I feel I'm missing out on some of the fine details of the embroidery. It is a nice book and the author did a great deal of research and artwork...but still. It was a little disappointing.	2001-05-29

I bought this book to get me started in bread baking. It's wonderful - just enough introduction, non-intimidating recipes, delicious Old World breads. Even a trouble-shooting section.

US	51281592	R10MSMHFIEV4BB	0553572512	228304751	Playing for the Ashes	Books	5	3	5	N	N	The best Elizabeth George mystery.	I love this author's mysteries. This is the first one I read, which made me go to the store and buy all her other books. I find this was the best one. The plotting is flawless and the characters are completely intriguing. I found that in this book she had many levels to the story, many nuances - and that was not necessarily so in her other mysteries (not to say the others aren't excellent). It's just that even after reading all her other works, this one stands out in my mind as the very best &amp; I remember the plot more clearly than her others. By the way Barbara Havers is one of my all-time female characters. I find her to be extremely likeable and realistic. Go Barbara - go Ms. George!	2000-11-21

This author's books are compared to Edward Gorey's; Gorey has an adult following. I realize these books are printed for the (children's) story rather than the artwork (unlike Gorey's books), but I believe the author tries to appeal to adult collectors as well as to young readers. As an adult hoping for an amusing and tame but macabre read, I was disappointed in his series. The author enjoys his own sense of humor very much; I can't say the same for the reader. My question is, how many times will he keep rehashing the same plot, with the same unfunny villain? Even the kids are going to catch on and grow tired of the same mediocre story appearing over and over. This is not an author who crosses over into the world of adult reading, much as he tries.	2000-11-15
