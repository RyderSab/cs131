I admit that his concept of mimesis is fascinating.  I even referred to his theory in my own general book on violence and culture (titled, aptly enough, \\"Violence and Culture\\" (Wadsworth, 2005).<br />However, as an anthropologist who has done subsequent research on religion and violence, I have discovered that he is profoundly wrong about his interpretation of violence and the sacred.  For one thing, he equates violence with sacrifice.  However, sacrifice is not even the earliest or most universal form of religious violence.  Hunting and gathering societies--which, you would think, would suffer from the most mimetic desire since there is so little differentiation in those groups--do not practice sacrifice.  Rather, as Jonathan Z. Smith has noted, sacrifice almost always involves domesticated species, which could not exist in the earliest (foraging) societies.<br />Further, religious violence takes many other forms, and an exclusive focus on sacrifice is more than wrong but downright misleading and counterproductive.  What about self-mortification, martyrdom, ethno-religious conflict, persecution, as well as the hackneyed topics of terrorism and holy war?<br />Second, his analysis of sacrifice is incorrect.  As a non-anthropologist, perhaps he could not know this.  But then, if he does not know the cross-cultural facts, he should not be writing on the subject.  As mentioned, sacrifice is NOT the universal religious practice that he thinks it is.  For another, most sacrifice has nothing to do with scape-goating; that is one--and a particularly Judeo-Christian--version of it.  To impose one religion's conceptions on all religions, or generalize it as characteristic of religion, is ethnocentric and falsifying.<br />Happily, Girard another specific prediction, in addition to his (false) claim of the universality of sacrifice.  He predicts that societies with legal systems to control violence should not engage in sacrifice.  This turns out to be completely wrong.  The most extensive cases of sacrifice have been associated with complex politically centralized societies, like the Greeks and Romans, the Aztec, the Hawaiians, the Dahomey, and of course the Hebrews.  Indeed, sacrifice is often the political act par excellence, the leader's exercise of life and death.<br />It is very dangerous and unfortunate that this book has been accepted so uncritically.  It has set the cross-cultural study of sacrifice, and religious violence in general, back by two or three decades.  People think that the definitive analysis of sacrifice has been made, when Girard has described one local version of one small part of religious violence and elevated it to the very essence of both religion and violence.  We will look back on this detour with regret.	2005-10-06

It is a very compact but comprehensive study of five American mission situations, from Spanish California to Puritan New England to American Midwest.  It shows just what the missionary project was in relation to Indian peoples, which can be and has been shown in other world areas as well (for instance, the Comaroffs on colonialism and missionaries in Africa).  This will be an unpleasant read for people who are unfamiliar with the history of white/Indian contact or with the history of missionaries. I know that many people--Christians mostly--see missionaries as good and helpful people, and no doubt many are.  However, the missionary project as such is ethnocentric and hegemonic, and in the days when missionaries had more power to compel their beliefs and practices on other societies, they used all of it. The only thing that restrains them today is a lack of power and a surplus of world attention.	2005-07-14

And it is unique that it does not bash or even particularly focus on religion--it is really more about political movements like Nazism and Communism.  However, his main point is well taken: mass movements and the people who join them have a lot in common. <br />Admittedly, Hoffer's psychology and sociology are a bit dated and simplistic: I doubt that every movement member is a self-disgusted misfit.  Some peope have genuine--if misplaced--hopes for a better future.  However, there is a great difference between a reformer and a revolutionary, and there is no reason to say we do not need both a little bit.   <br />His discussions of hatred, belief, and leadership are probably the scariest and truest parts of his account.  People seem to need something to hate, to demonize, in order to solidify their own movement, and honestly we see this as clearly in the anti-terrorist campaign as in the terrorist one.  That people are willing to kill and die for vague and even false ideals and symbols is only too true. And that a movement leader need not be so much intelligent as forceful and certain and cunning should make all of us, 21st century Americans too, shudder.   <br />Overall, perhaps the most chilling thing is his awareness that certainty makes all other considerations disappear.  Beware of the person who is too certain of his own and his cause's truth and goodness.  When you start hearing leaders speak of evil, watch out.	2005-07-08

This book, written by a serious historian and First Amendment scholar, is an incredible resource for the history of blasphemy and heresy laws in Western civilization.  It is not anti-Christian, unless exposing Christianity's true history is anti-Christian (which I suppose it could be, to a Christian!).  It goes back to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews and gives a very objective account of the laws and attitudes.  Particularly valuable are the sections about early American blasphemy laws, which prove once and for all that the U.S. was not created by or for religious freedom; each group had its own \\"true belief,\\" and anything else was not only false but punishable by law.<br /><br />If Christians cannot take their own history straight up, perhaps they should think about that, especially when they get to uppity about instituting their beliefs into law today.  Otherwise, this is a brave and important book, full of valuable information and worth the read of anyone who is interested in religion and law--and how dangerous it is to mix the two.	2005-07-08

This is by far the best anthology, especially for the price. Some are up to $100, which is an awful lot to ask an undergrad to spend.  Even compared to those, which can be large and dense, this one stands out for a particular reason.<br /><br />Most of its competitors present their offerings in a kind of mechanical and sequential way: \\"here is a section on myth, here is a section on ritual, etc.\\"  After using Lambek's text for the second time, I really began to appreciate how his book has a trajectory.  It is really \\"up to something.\\"  Unlike the others, he is subtly developing a perspective, and the selections contribute almost universally to that perspective.  I think even the students began to realize what he was trying to accomplish and approved of it.<br /><br />The book is not perfect.  It is heavy on ritual and short on some other topics.  It does little or nothing with specialists, and nothing at all with altered states of consciousness/hallucinogens.  Some of the selections are probably too hard for undergrads, and the piece by Wittgenstein, while he is important, does not convey enough of his thinking to be particularly helpful.<br /><br />I understand a new edition is forthcoming.  I know that I will be using it and encourage others to do so as well.	2005-06-30

I actually did neither: I learned some things from it and also found it exasperating at times. <br />Hillman makes a very good point that war is not purely instrumental or rational but is also \\"mythological.\\"  However, I found his musing on classical philosophy and mythology futile and self-important; it was one of those exercises in the writer's erudition rather than in anything that really advances the cause. <br />His comments about American lack of aesthetics were well taken.  This is one place where his idiosyncratic opinion-making actually made some headway. <br />In his later discussion of religion versus mythology, he asserts things that are simply false from an empirical and cross-cultural perspective.  For instance, when he says on p.179 that mythical gods and religious gods are different, he is talking sheer nonsense; the only difference is a god you believe in versus one you do not.  He also says that myths are for amusement and religion for belief.  That is stupid, since people believe their myths to be true--at least Christians do.  When he says that \\"myth never insists its gods are 'real,'\\" he shows an utter lack of awareness of cross-cultural religion. <br />So, take away what you will from this book, but read it carefully. Do not go on his flights of fancy with him, and do not seriously entertain his distinction between religion and myth.  Myth is just somebody else' religion.  To them, your religion is myth.	2005-06-30

It is a little overlooked in the field, but it contains some valuable information and makes some provocative points.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about this case is that the Mayotte conception of spirits so totally contradicts the conventional understanding of them.  That is, their spirits are not particularly \\"spiritual\\"!  They think of spirits as a \\"race\\" or another kind of being, not entirely different from humans.  People who are thinking seriously about spirits and spiritual matters, especially about the cultural relativity of spirits and spirituality, need to take a serious look at this society.<br /><br />Also, his discussion of spirit possession is interesting and worth consideration.  The next time I teach the course, I will mention this book to the students, and I have included references to it in my own anthropology of religion manuscript.	2005-06-30

It is organized well chronologically and includes enough orienting discussion to suggest why the ideas are important and how they are related.  I find myself referring to this collection often, as I think and write about reason and religion and philosophy and science. <br />It is astounding to consider how \\"modern\\" and naturalistic these thinkers were.  Not that they were modern-day scientists by any means, and their ideas are still confounded with the religion and metaphysics of their time.  Still, they were struggling to be clear and consistent, and that is an amazing thing to think about for over 2500 years ago.  One wonders what these researches would have led to if not for the \\"Platonic\\" turn in philosophy and the subsequent collapse of philosophy and reason altogether for a thousand years.	2005-06-30

The introduction claims that gods and spirits are distinguishable along a continuum, but the facts here, and elsewhere, suggest otherwise.  There is no dividing line, or even dividing spectrum, between gods and spirits.  The very concepts may be culture-bound Western ones.  Sometimes what they call \\"gods\\" are highly personal, sometimes not. Sometimes they are moral, sometimes not.  In the end, there is nothing that distinguishes them except the Western/Christian meanings of the terms.   <br />That said, the case studies are very well done and interesting. They raise many valuable points about belief, history, and cultural integration.  If only this or a similar compilation went beyond the Pacific and looked at spirit/god beliefs in a truly global perspective.	2005-06-30

If anyone still is not aware of the dimensions of religious conflict in the modern world, they really need to be. <br />On the other hand, it is a little too easy to take shots at religion as the source of all the evil in the world. The simple but complex truth is that religion motivates people...to do good or to do harm, as their beliefs lead.  Religion is neither all good nor all bad. It is probably all false (!), but a more serious and in-depth analysis of what violence is, what religion is, and how the two are related is necessary, rather than gleeful sticks poked in the eye of religion.  God (!) knows, people have done great violence for non-religious reasons too. The point is to understand how religion can contribute to violence, not just to point an accusatory finger at religion. <br />I deal some with religion and violence in my new books, \\"Natural Atheism\\" and \\"Violence and Culture: A Cross-Cultural and Interdisciplinary Approach.\\"	2005-06-28

He makes many insightful observations and phrases things in quotable ways.  Anyone who is new to, or even fairly familiar with, postmodern and popular culture would benefit from this book.

Much if not most of this book is extended excerpts of original documents from 2 centuries ago.  Some people might not like reading all of this old and stiff prose, but it gives us the most authentic picture possible of what was going on at the time.   <br />The inclusion of the deaf-mute discussion, while not everyone's cup of tea, illustrates two important points.  First, questions of \\"human nature\\" were being approached from a number of directions simultaneously even 200 years ago, and some of these insights actually bore some fruit.  Some of them were silly and even insulting, but people did not yet know what was what, so they had to try a lot of things.  Second, out of the study of children like the wild boy, and deaf-mute children, some really innovative and important teaching methods emerged.  Again, people had no idea how to explain or intervene with these cases until recently, and a few brave and thoughtful individuals began to find humane and effective treatments and training methods that we all benefit from today.   <br />Everyone interested in human nature or the early days of social science should grapple with this book.	2005-06-28

It does not accurately depict how Aboriginals talk or act.  It is a get-rich attempt to cash in on the \\"Celestine Prophecy\\" type \\"the primitives must be smarter than us\\" gravy train.  It is the worst kind of \\"noble savage\\" tripe.  At least if she had offered it as fiction, it would have been just juvenile. But to offer it as fact is simply dishonest.  Obviously she was trying to start a cult following and become a celebrity.  As a professional anthropologist, I deeply resent this kind of lying, and all of her readers should resent being lied to.

However, he has compromised this contribution by making the specious distinction between \\"authentic\\" religion and \\"corrupted\\" religion.  An \\"authentic\\" religion is one that only does nice, happy things for everybody?  That never judges or condemns anyone?  That never does any harm to anyone?  Such a religion has never existed.  Well, maybe Jainism, since it believes that all beings--human and otherwise--have senses and feel pain and can cause the harm-doer some spiritual consequences.   <br />What Kimball fails to appreciate is that all of the five warning signs he highlights are inherent features of virtually all religions!  \\"Absolute truth claims\\"?  Doesn't Christianity say that it is the one absolute truth?  Doesn't it say that all non-believers--even of other religions--will go to hell?  And \\"holy war\\"--what does he think a \\"crusade\\" is?  No, by his own criteria, all religions are \\"corrupted\\" and therefore dangerous...and they are. <br />Selengut's book is more sensible when he says that all religion is powerful and dangerous and that it is dangerous because it is powerful.  Kimball's book is an attempt to whitewash religion--or the religion he likes--by distancing it from its own nature.  That is impossible. <br />Groothius' review below, which is also critical of Kimball, makes an allied mistake.  One cannot talk of \\"moral errors\\" in a religion.  First of all, who can say what a \\"moral error\\" is at all?  What standard do you compare it to?  If the Bible says to kill your disobedient sons--if Abraham was ordered to kill his son--is that a \\"moral error\\"?  I don't know; if the authority of all morality says to do it, I guess it is moral.  Second, since every religion provides its own moral context, how do youjudge the morality of its morality?  Is Christian morality moral?  To Christians, yes.  To others, maybe not.  This just proves that morality is relativeand that all of us--Christians and non-Christians--have a morality that is higher than religion, by which we can judge religion.  Kimball does it, Groothius does it, I do it, and you do it.  But if religion is not the absolute ground of morality, nor the absolute ground of empirical fact, what good is it?  Apparently, pretty good at making believers think they are right enough to impose it on the rest of us, even by force.	2005-06-26

What Smith does is compile a very eclectic set of martyr stories, illustrating the facts that (1) not all martyrs are religiously motivated and (2) not all martyrs are nice people.  Some ARE blood-thirsty killers.  And it is not the cause that makes someone a martyr.  It is two important things: absolute certainty that the martyr is right and everyone else is wrong, and a belief that martyrdom somehow makes the cause more noble.  Both of these facts are scary. <br />As Smith states more than once, the martyr is the ultimate egotist: he/she is right, the world is wrong, and he/she is showing the world something with his/her self-sacrifice.  But that cannot be true: there have been lots of martyrs for lots of causes--in fact, even diametrically opposed causes.  The Allies who died in World War II could call themselves martyrs for freedom, and the Nazis who died could call themselves martyrs for Nazism or Germany.  Who decides who is a martyr...and what cause is noble?   <br />The martyr is in the additional tricky position of wanting and needing to die without APPEARING to want to die.  That is just suicide.  The martyr must think that death is perhaps avoidable, and also that death will mean a greater success than life could have accomplished.  It is a fine line to walk, one that ultimately not only fails but is contradictory.   <br />People who respect martyrs, or who want to be martyrs, should read this book.  Also, read my new \\"Violence and Culture\\" (Wadsworth 2005), that puts martyrdom and other forms of ideological violence in perspective.   <br />And remember, terrorists often think of themselves as martyrs, and martyrs often think of the ones who kill them as terrorists.	2005-06-26

It is smart, organized, and engaging. Students really enjoy it for its analytical clarity and its rich descriptions.  It is an important read for anyone interested in the human roots of violence. <br />As he points out, the \\"myth of pure evil\\" asserts that \\"evil\\" is a force or entity apart from us, rather than behavior that we engage in.  WE are always good and innocent, but THEY are always evil and solely responsible for the bad in our life.  That is just silly. <br />Baumeister's analyses of the group effect, the root causes of violence (we should stop using the term \\"evil\\" altogether, since one person's evil is another person's noble truth), the escalating factors, and more are valuable to anyone who is seriously interested in why we normal regular humans perform violence sometimes and even feel good about it...or feel nothing at all.   <br />I integrated insights from this book, as well as many other sources, including Zimbardo's work, Kreisberg's work, and many cross-cultural studies into my own recent book, \\"Violence and Culture\\" (Wadsworth 2005).  If we want to do anything about violence, we must understand it realistically, not just attribute it to some irrational, foreign, and sadistic force or being that could never just be us.  As Stanley Milgram's obedience experiments illustrated, it could be and has been us.	2005-06-26

Scientists call it \\"reductionism\\" when you try to explain a complex phenomenon in terms of one simple concept or theme.  To reduce atheism to childhood experience is reductionist, and it is false and silly.  For example, I am an atheist, and I had a very happy and normal childhood--didn't hate my father, didn't have an absentee father.  The argument, furthermore, is irrelevant, since it is at best an ad hominem argument--that is, attacking the person rather than the position. Even it were true, it would not prove the falseness of atheism; you cannot judge a position by the people who hold it. <br />Finally, the argument could just as easily be made right back at the theist: since Christianity offers a perfect father-figure, perhaps it is the theist who is trying to fix some flaw in his or her own upbringing.  In a sense, theism is perpetual childhood.	2005-05-26

That is how all anthropologists will feel about this book.  Anthropology is not for anybody's \\"witness.\\"  It is to witness the diversity of culture and religion itself.  Anthropology is not designed or intended to impose one culture or religion on another.  In fact, that is the very opposite and antithesis of anthropology. Anthropology is a science and a method for understanding and valuing other cultures on their own terms, not \\"witnessing\\" your own culture to them. And that is what one's own culture or religion is--just one more culture or religion in the pageant of human cultural and religious diversity.

That is NOT the message of anthropology.  As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly.  Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms.  The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own \\"truths\\" on others.  If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book.  But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction.

It has a very approachable style: it is written from her own experience, and it is not disrespectful of believers nor mean-spirited in its humor, unlike so many other such pieces of work.  She comes herself from a believing perspective and gives the reasons why she came to see through it.<br /><br />Beyond that, I share many of her key assessments of atheism: it is not a religion or a belief system; it is the rational conclusion to the question of gods; morality is relative and socially constructed; theists do (and have a vested interested in doing so) misrepresent us and misunderstand us.<br /><br />For my own thoughts on these issues, see my \\"Natural Atheism\\" or visit [...]<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like so many atheist books, it focuses exclusively on Christianity, rather than taking the big picture that Christianity is just one of many religions.  There is no need to argue about the Bible, since it is just one of many \\"sacred books.\\"  We should emphasize the point that Christianity is not the only theism and that theism is not the only religion.

I am thrilled because someone has had the insight and courage to say that our human characteristics are not all that unique in the world and that culture is not all-or-nothing.  I am saddened because it was made painfully clear just how much our own values and beliefs affect what we see...or even what we WILL see.  Western society with its insistence that humans are utterly distinct and even \\"unnatural\\" and its refusal to look at certain issues like sexuality means that we are constantly blinding ourselves to the facts.  If there was ever a treatise that showed just how much cultural affects perceptions--including the perceptions of what and where is culture!--this is it.  I agree that the flow of the book is a little jumpy, going from discussions of personalities like Konrad Lorenz to discussions of ethological observations, but here too we get to see human blinders in action.  Too many people looked at Lorenz--and still look at Darwin--through their own political (and \\"other\\") agendas and do not judge the work itself and the facts it is based on.  Maybe if we were a little LESS personal in our evaluations of the world around us and took it on its own terms, we would understand more and argue less.	2005-05-17

Oh sure, it could have done more--what book couldn't?--but for its range and accessbility, it is a fine piece of work.  It makes the point, that other books like those of George Ritzer have been making, that consumption is a serious cultural issue that has been neglected by social scientists.  When I look, for example, at cultural anthropology textbooks, there is usually no mention, or at best a few words, about consumption at all.  It is as if production and distribution are important and mysterious but consumption is trivial and obvious.  I welcome the new direction that emphasizes consumption, especially because, as he and Ritzer suggest, we are in a post-production society where supply is not our problem any more.  Rather, demand and how our demands are shaped are the main issue.  This book is a great lauching point: from here, people can dig more deeply into the aspects of the subject that interest them.  But if this is as far as they go, they will have had a pleasant and informative journey.	2005-05-17

They also tell us about a family, a neighborhood, a society, or an era.  Bahze's book does all of these.  Not only is it a well-told--painfully well-told--tale of his passage through childhood to adulthood, but it is an account of the culture of the Balkans (specifically Macedonia), the end of Yugoslavia, and the social attitudes toward and (therefore) problems of gay men in that culture and many others.  Bazhe has just the right narrative voice to tell a story that is full of humanity and passion, but also of pain--much of it very unnecessary pain.  People who are not sensitive to gay rights issues should perhaps not read this book...but then again, perhaps they are exactly the ones who SHOULD read it.  Also, people who are squeamish about violence and sex should not read it...but then again, perhaps they are exactly the ones who should read it.  Bazhe, throughout and maybe because of his experiences, is a gay Macedonian man of a certain time and place, but above all he is the one thing that we all are--a human being.  We all have our damages, and we all have our healings.  Maybe Bazhe's book will help us a little with both.	2005-05-09

Boyer and others suggest, rather, that religion is actually a epi-phenomenon of other more mundane interests, tendencies, and capabilities that evolved in humans for quite non-religious reasons. <br />Boyer discusses and supports with empirical field research a variety of these foundations, both cognitive and social.

It is great when atheists, independent spirits that we are, can agree and aid one another.  I am happy to have read this book. [...] Mills' book has a very different project from my own.  His is a straight-forward and fun approach to the issue of the existence of god, in particular the Christian god.  People who do not already know the literature on atheism will learn a lot here, and people who know all the arguments will enjoy the tone and clarity of this presentation.  There are two small things I object to in Mills' work.  One is his use of the capital \\"He\\" or \\"Him\\" when talking about the Christian god and his purported son.  That is what Christians do, but for those of us who do not believe there is a god or that he ever had a son, I see no reason to conform to their style. [...]The other is his use of the word \\"belief\\" when no belief is at issue at all.  Atheists do not \\"believe\\" there is no god; they conclude so from good evidence.  Scientists do not \\"believe\\" in evolution; evolution is a good conclusion from solid evidence.  Nor does a person \\"believe\\" that their foot is at the end of their leg nor that liver tastes bad.  Those are not matters of \\"belief\\" at all.  I think it is really important for us to separate belief from knowledge and all the other things that are not belief in any way.  What is left for belief is claims that are either based on no evidence or actually fly in the fact of contradictory evidence.  [...]	2005-01-17

He presents the arguments for/against god(s) very convincingly, and all atheists--and all theists, quite honestly--should be familiar with his work.  After they have read it and thought about it rationally, of course all theists should atheists!  However, Smith ONLY focuses on the arguments for/against god(s) to the exclusion of other important contemporary issues, including church/state separation, the debate between science and religion, and the worldwide phenomenon of fundamentalism.  Also, he continues to make certain non-rational assumptions and claims, particularly the one that there are rational and irrational beliefs.  However, even by his own measure, if we look at belief itself more closely, we see that all beliefs are irrational by definition.  They might not all be WRONG, but then some guesses are right too.  The question is whether one arrives at one's positions by reason (evidence and logic) or by some other process.  If one arrives by evidence and logic, then one has knowledge, not belief.  If one does not arrive by reason, they one has belief, not knowledge.  So, all beliefs--even the (accidentally) correct ones--are nonetheless irrational.  And why would you want to hold an irrational position that might equally well be false or true?  [...]	2004-12-22

That person would probably want to get in and out very quickly with the general idea.  For that, it achieves its purpose.  However, that person would also come away with some troubling ideas.  It is either the lack of length or of the lack of reason that leads Baggini to make confused statements about faith and belief.  He still subscribes to the notion that belief is a rational thing, akin to knowledge.  It is not.  He also distinguishes between faith and belief, when they are exactly the same thing.  One holds a belief on faith because there is no other basis to hold it on.  If it were rational (that is, based on evidence and logic), it would not be a belief but knowlege.  He even virtually insinuates that atheism is a religion, which is silly.  If atheism is a religion, then not collecting stamps is a hobby.  [...]	2004-12-21

As an atheist and a rationalist, I was happy to see the success of this book.  However, as I read it I became more and more frustrated.  The knock against religion for its violence is an old and cliche one, made before by James Haught, Karen Armstrong, Mark Juergensmeyer, and many others.  The long chapter on Islam is overdone and makes it look like it is worse than other monotheistic religions, while the real difference is the OTHER aspects of culture that dilute the intolerance and destructiveness of, for example, Christianity.  Without Enlightenment European culture Christianity would be just as bad--and was. <br />The last few chapters, about morality and spirituality, totally run off the rails.  They show that Harris does not really know what reason is, nor what evidence is, nor what relativism is.  He is either short-sighted or completely wrong about his entire discussion on these subjects.  Logic and reason are not \\"intuitive\\" at all, spirituality/mysticism is not rational (if it were, all mystics would arrive at the same conclusions--see John Horgan's \\"Rational Mysticism\\"), and morality is both more and less than happiness.  Christians are happy that the world will end in an apocalypse, and \\"moral values\\" voters are happy to deprive others of their rights.  The last few chapters should be chopped off the book. <br />A much better book on belief, reason, and atheism is \\"Natural Atheism\\" (visit [...] which not only defines and explains reason, but also discusses the social and historical circumstances of toleration, church/state separation, science, and atheist activism much better and more consistently.  It also explains what relativism really is and why there is no such thing as a \\"rational belief\\" or a \\"rational religion.\\"  It, finally, settles the debates about spirituality, agnosticism, and belief vs. knowledge.	2004-11-24
