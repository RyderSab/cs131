The one but significant drawback is that the authors offered no investment advice at all, other than his suggestion of the trade of the decade (buying gold and squaring all stock positions in 2000), as manifested by the last sentence of this book, that 'As Paul Volcker put it, \\"It will all have to be adjusted someday.\\" Why not enjoy it?' I think readers like me who have already read tens of investment or trading book would still appreciate this book, in particular the authors good, humorous and sometimes sarcastic writing skill. For those who just buy it with the purpose of \\"Surviving the Soft Depresson of the 21st Century\\", they are very likely to be disappointed.<br /><br />p.s. If it were not for this book, I never realized that the famous quote from Einstein that \\"God does not play dice\\" was a response to Heisenberg's Indeterminacy Principle which led to the naming, if not success, of Soros' Quantum Fund.	2005-10-03

Despite some reviewers' complaint against the lack of structured action plans and networking strategies, I am satisfied with the many tactics or methods discussed vividly thru the author's own personal stories. Those sections of \\"Connectors' Hall of Fame\\" profiling Bill Clinton, Dalai Lama, Dale Carnegie and so on are informative and motivating. However, as per my title for this review, I doubt how many readers can have the passion and the \\"sincerity\\" of the author to develop relatively deep, if not close relationships with all his targets, which is the key stratgy of the author himself. Also, as per the chapter \\"Balance is BS\\", the author had manifested his committment on a daily schedule starting 0400 and no indication of when he could go to bed after all those fully scheduled night events. FYI, the author got divorced at least once. I knew so because he had told a story of breaking the ice (and for excusing his getting distracted) through discussing it openly.<br /><br />In case you are very committed to networking, this book may motivate you and offer you some new tactics. If you just want to read for leisure about somebody successful in networking, it's okay though I think \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" is a better choice. However, for the majority of sales practitioners not of those direct marketing type who thrive primarily on personal relationships, you may think that the effort required is too overwhelming, time and money wise.	2005-10-03

This can be a good textbook for undergrads, but far from satisfying veteran marketers who fought hard daily on the front line for new means to satisfy the ever increasingly demanding customers, or readers who had finished more than five marketing books, probably with over half of them by Kotler himself.<br /><br />Instead of buying this book, I strongly suggest you to read the review by Donald Mitchell who had written a very good summary of it. Perhaps you can simply read de Bono's Lateral Thinking, a move that will give you higher returns on both time and book cost.	2005-10-03

I think most readers, like me, already know the importance to make a product remarkable, innovative and outstanding (a purple cow in a group of brown) so as to differentiate it from the sea of competitors. What we want is the means to do it. It's disappointing that the author focused on the \\"why\\"s with many not so \\"accurate\\" or \\"relevant\\" examples and counter-examples, but failed to deliver the \\"how\\"s as promised on the book title: to transform and to be remarkable. He kept on criticizing the common 4Ps and the TV ad push type marketing, but couldnt bring out something new, systematic and practical for managers to follow, especially those who work in big corps where red tape had choked most of the innovation process. I am sorry to say this book simply lacks substance but is full of cliche. Unless marketing, customer-orientation and differentiation is something new to you, I am quite sure you will get the same opinion as mine if you can finish reading it.	2005-09-20

For example, he had covered in the 28 page first chapter, psychology theories (with source reference, and simple background/statistics info/support) including over-confidence, over-optimissim, cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, conservatism bias, anchoring, representativeness heuristic, availability bias, ambiguity aversion, frame dependence/mental accounting, utility theory (dynamic) prospect theory etc. Do you get what I mean?<br /><br />IMHO, this book can serve as a recap for advanced traders who understand well basic financial concepts including Efficient Market Hypothesis and it's offsprings like CAPM, and can read statistics and essays with ease. For novices, \\"Beyond Greed and Fear: Understanding Behavioral Finance and the Psychology of Investing\\" by Hersh Shefrin and \\"The psychology of Finance by Lars Tvede\\" should be better choices.<br /><br />p.s. The conclusions in the end of each chapter are well written, I must add. However, I cant say there are significant correlation between individual chapters.	2005-09-07

I got one right and one wrong. He told me that the puzzles came out of a book named \\"How would you move Mount Fuji?\\" \\"What an interesting puzzle book!\\" I thought to myself and urged him to lend it to me. So I read it and am now writing this review.<br /><br />Unexpectedly, this book is more than only puzzles, but recruitment process and strategies of Microsoft which used puzzles extensively in job interviews. However, puzzle fans need not be disappointed because answers to puzzles or actually \\"means to reply interview questions logically\\" still occupy page 147-244 of this 244 page content book.<br /><br />Though I am not a true enthusiast of puzzles, I still think this book is quite an interesting read if you have the leisure, or the desire to prepare yourself for a job interview in Microsoft or equivalent.

The convergence of the above flatterners, made possible under circumstances like dotcom bubble, change in ideology in China, Y2K etc resulted the creation of a global, web-enabled playing field that allows for multiple forms of collaboration - the sharing of knowledge and work - in real time, without regard to geography, distance, or, in the near future, even language....This is what the author says the world has been flattened. pg 177 The above briefly tells what the first half of the book is about. The second half is primarily the author's argument for free trade, the reasons behind the difference in growth of various developing countries like why China outruns Mexico and Egypt, the need for reform retail as well as reform wholesale to make the transformation truly successful, how US faces this new global challenge and even how Al-Quada benefits under this globalization 3.0 process.<br /><br />In short, a must read for all global villagers in case you dont wanna lag behind. It's eye-opening, knowledgeable, insightful and helpful! Dont miss it.<br /><br />Below please find an Africa proverb on the book which may tell the main theme the author wants his readers to hear.<br /><br />Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up.

With much struggle, I felt that I am obliged to warn potential readers/buyers of something they need to know.<br /><br />As a trader and trading book lover, I expected this book to be something like \\"The Misbehaviour of Markets\\", or a slightly more serious/academic version of \\"Liar's Poker\\", \\"Fiasco\\", \\"Wall Street Meat\\" and so on. It turned out to be a \\"very\\" serious and in fact quite boring autobiography of the author himself, or at most a history of the growth of physicists (especially in the 80's when there's no professional named \\"programmer\\" in the market. Surprisingly you got to carry on till page 126 (out of 270) to get the first scent of a trading/investment book triggered by the name \\"Goldman\\" which headhunted the author to take up his first job in Wall Street.

However, I think the editor or co-author of the book had done a great job. The \\"Stream of the Desert\\" diary format, with a headline/key point at the top, 150-200 words of elaboration in the middle, and an action point at the bottom of each page/day really serves the purpose of providing readers with insight and motivation for getting things done in an effective and efficient manner. In short, an invaluable asset to be placed near any manager's working desk.<br /><br />Below please find some of the sayings I like the most:-<br /><br />- Above all management is about producing results.<br />- Only a society in dynamic disequilibrium has stability and cohesion<br />- The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create it<br />- Decision makers need to factor into their present decisions the future that has already happened.<br />- It can be said that there are no underdeveloped countries. There are only undermanaged ones.<br />- In an ecology, the whole has to be seen and understood and the parts exist only in contemplation of the whole.<br />- No organization can do better than the people it has.<br />- The management of people is a marketing job<br />- The challenge to executives is to coordinate efforts of all categories of workers.<br />- Make systematic improvement a priority.<br />- In cost control an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br />- Start with what is right rather than what is acceptable.<br />- By far the most common mistake is to treat a generic situation as if it were a series of unique events.<br />- The right answer to the wrong problem is very difficult to fix.<br />- The problem is not with technology. It is with mentality.<br />- The executive and the knowledge worker have only one tool - information.	2005-08-09

You simply can tell so by your frequent encounter in one single page of more than ten quotations from figureheads of large banks or federal agencies to support just one minor argument, and the large number of big names the author needed to thank and quote on his book) Somebody may credit that as evidence of serious work but to me it's just so tedious and exhausting. I must say that the points raised by the author are definitely valid. However, a better balance should be struck that the interest and ability of the mass public readers/investors should be taken care of, if it's packaged and marketed as an investment book like what it's. \\"Devil take the hindmost by Edward Chancellor\\" is an excellent example of such, though it hadnt covered the Internet Bubble. However, for learning and avoiding \\"bubbles\\", the later is a much better choice. At least, you wont feel get drown in a sea of data (both qualitative and quantitative wise).	2005-07-29

Perhaps the author's method is so simple and straightforeward that the book is really short, despite the addition of his autobiography and interesting personal experience, say, his encounter with two persons who quitted their job for full time trading before the burst of 2000 Internet Bubble.<br /><br />I am obligated to comment it as an interesting read. However, the captioned method is not so practical to common investors who lack the patience/scale to carry on such mode of operation, unless they restrict their scope of monitoring to a limited number of stock, thus drastically reduced the number of opportunities available. So I gave the title of my review as it is. If you have already read many trading books before, you can take it as a supplement. Otherwise, you may spend your $16 more productively on some other investment or trading books.<br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />With the addition of over 100% of material (from 87 of Book 1 to 212 pages of this) and selling for 41% less (from $13.56 to $7.98), I see no point why I shouldnt rate this a 5 stars, based on its much extended coverage on TA and effort to make its contrarian applications small investor friendly.<br /><br />Below please find a copy and paste from Appendix A For Short Sellers (Handle with Caution) that I want to show you some juice of this book. Hope it can help.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most stocks tha are clearly overvalued and popular shorts among hedge funds are usually in strong up trends. I have seen many short side managers forced to cover because the stocks kept getting more overvalued, only to collapse after they had bought the shares back......My advice is simple. Look for stocks that are in well-established downtrends, especially those that have stopped going down and are moving sideways. Then check Yahoo!'s Finance section and click on the Insider link or go to the Washington Service. Look to see if insiders sold at higher price levels and are now selling at lower levels, especially if they had not sold for a few months while the stock was moving sideways. If they start selling again at lower levels, that usually means whatever problems they are having that caused the stock to drop are still occuring. The first price drop loses the momentum investors. The second drop, after additional bad news, will lose value investors. With no one left to support it, the stock will drop suddenly and continue to drift lower. Pg 175-6ng up trends.

It preached viable solutions that Bush had not adopted. To name a few: \\"Frankly, I hope Saddam disappears tomorrow. But even if he does, that's not going to solve our problem. Saddam is a conventional threat who can be eliminated by conventional means. He inspires no one. The idea people who inspired the hijackers are religious leaders, pseudo-intellectuals, pundits and educators, primiarily in Eygpt and in Saudia Arabia, which continues to use its vast oil wealth to spread its austere and intolerant brand of Islam,  Wahabism.

FYI, I like the following the most.<br /><br />John Gottman's pioneering research suggests that there is a magic ratio of 5 to 1 in terms of our balance of positive to negative interactions for marriages to significantly more likely to succeed....Workgroups with ratios greater than 3 to 1 are significantly more productive than teams do not reach this ratio. However, the upper limit is 13 to 1. Pg 55-57<br /><br />In short, a good read. If it can be less expensive, even better.	2005-07-05

In other words, those who are already preparing their own daily trading journals or have somebody else to complete the job will definitely benefit from the advice of this book. However, if you wont bother to do even the minimal daily book keeping job, not to say those relatively complicated analysis made easy by software readily available in the market, please give this book a pass.	2005-06-13

Though I dont go to gym nor attend any martial art class, as a movie fan of Bruce, I still find it very interesting and informative, in particular those very high quality b/w photos that fully show  his incredible charm and power. The author claims that he possesses unique inside information that distinguishes his book from others. In this respect, I believe the author is authentic because he gets a foreword by Bruce's wife who told the very story about the birth of the JKD philosophy. Morever, there are many handwritings and drawings by Bruce, in addition to those training manuals, diet menus and time tables blah blah blah.<br /><br />In case you just wanna know more about Bruce Lee regarding things I mentioned above, I think this book will satisfy you well.	2005-05-28

Not only the author's writing skill is substandard as reflected by the very jumpy and disorganised style of telling by and large similar stories of financial bubbles in the past, one can hardly tell the key points of individual chapters (and I still cant figure out why they are in such a non-chronological nor theme related arrangement), not to say remember them. Highlighted \\"Insana Insights\\" here and there in each chapter are fine, but cant save the book. On the other hand, dont know whether the author wanted to return favor to his guests or to keep himself politically correct, he seldom criticized \\"survivors\\" at all and his very positive comment on Abby Cohen and some star analysts, considering their nimble advice near the burst of the Internet Bubble, can be but anything close to the reality.<br /><br />In a word, not worth the time. It wont help you at all not to be fooled by the next invesment fad, mania or bubble. Please pick those books I mentioned above instead.	2005-05-13

Luckily enough, this collection of 33 speeches was by all means a right choice.

In case you got the same objective as mine, or you wanna improve your English by studying works of a Nobel laureate, it should suit you well. If you just want to learn his outstanding quotations only, \\"The wicked wit and wisdom of Winston Churchill by Dominique Enright\\" should be a better and easier choice.	2005-05-10

They are brilliant, I must say. However, the absence of the full context did deprive me some interest of reading it. That's my problem, I admit.

Too neutral and safe	Despite the negative reviews here on Amazon, for somebody who really wanna know the life and style of Julian Robertson, I have no choice but picked this only book (I still cant believe it) on Amazon about Wall Street's infamous Tiger.<br /><br />After reading it, I am obliged to concur with many reviewers here that this book resembled much a copy and paste of info on limited sources primarily printed material on Business Week and Robertson's private letters to his investors. You would never learn how the Tiger had thrived in the land of bulls and bears as promised on the book cover. Dont know whether the author had tried too hard to keep himself as neutral as possible or to avoid lawsuits in the magnitude of multi-millions as in Robertson vs Business Week, little personal insight was available. What's worse, little had been told on big events, say, the yen/Russian bond trade in 1998, that might be considered a turning point to the destiny of the Tiger.<br /><br />In short, unless you are so desperate to read something about Julian Robertson and that this book is your only choice as far as you know, please give it a pass.	2005-03-14

Well, if I wear the hat of a pro, this book is far from compleat. However, for those who have less than a year's experience in trading or investment, and would like to know enough not to go broke, this book suits them well with trading psychology, strategies (futures and options, though I doubt whether beginners should trade options at all), TA (waves, moving averages and trendlines), some fundamental info about different types of commodities, and common things that a novice needs to know in a well written, easily apprehensible Rule 1/2/3...

Therefore, my comment might look more positive than other reviewers who had read the authors' other books. In fact, when I bought it, I took it as a book of communications. Of course I was wrong and it is a book about \\"leadership\\". As a middle aged mid-tier manager who had read many books about leadership, I am obliged to say that this is not outstanding. However, I must give my praise to the part devoted to the importance and practice of \\"listening\\". The author gave interesting messages about it and presented even more interesting sayings, such as:-<br /><br />\\"\\"<br />No man would listen to you talk if he didn't know it was his next turn. - Edgar Watson Howe<br /><br />You aint learning nothing when you're doing all the talking. - Lyndon Johnson<br /><br />Big people monopolize the listening. Small people monopolize the talking. - David Schwartz<br /><br />After watching the novice take several swings at the tennis ball, the pro stopped him and suggested ways he could improve his stroke. But each time he did, the student interrupted him and gave his opinion of the problem,...and the coach began to nod his head in agreement. When the lesson ended, a woman who had been watching said to the pro, \\"why did you go along with that arrogant man's stupid suggestions?\\" The pro smiled and replied, \\"I learned a long time ago that it's a waste of time to try to sell real answers to anyone who just wants to buy echoes.\\"<br /><br />Beware of putting yourself into a position where you think you know all the answers. Anytime you do, you'll be putting yourself in danger. It's almost impossible to think of yourself as \\"the expert\\" and continue growing and learning at the same time. All great learners are great listeners.<br /><br />A funny thing happens when you don't make a practice of listening to people. They find others who will. Sometimes the consequences can be disastrous.<br /><br />The friends who listen to us are the ones we move towards, and we want to sit in their radius. - Karl Menninger<br />\\"\\"<br /><br />To me, the 20 pages in Chapter 4 \\"Listens to people\\" already pays back the price of the book. Of course, if you deem the above copy and paste \\"uninteresting\\", you'd better get another book.

As a trading book fan and a Chinese who know Zen and Tao well, I do like the first part of it as food for thought, and definitely not as reading material to sharpen my trading edge. I doubt whether the very vague Zen or Tao approach taken by the author can be well understood and practised by western traders. Furthermore, I agree with a previous reviewer that the \\"trade with the trend/flow\\" concept preached by the author contradict a little bit with his own quasi-countertrend system presented in the second part. So, I suggest those who dont have access to Metastock nor Omega Tradestation facilities should give it a pass. It's definitely not a smart way of investing if one puts money on something that does you little good.	2005-02-21

If so, what is the magnitude of the profits? What kinds of risks does a mimicking strategy impose on outside investors? Given the risks, is it still worth it?\\"<br /><br />By and large, the author did provide answers to the above. Profit for the mimicking is still available, after report delays, transaction costs and the need to mimic over 50 multiple transaction to lower risk. For a 12 mth holding period, the strategy outperforms the market by 2% for buying but underperforms by 3.3% for selling.<br /><br />You can tell the conclusion is simple, but the author did use a lot of set up, with lengthly coverage of legal issues, before summing it up in the very last 14th chapter of this 341 content page book. As per title of this review, it is well researched, informative but too academic and long.<br /><br />p.s. One minor complaint: The author should give more details on parameter setting and provide an optimal (profit maximization) strategy on the mimicking. Perhaps he did, but he didnt show it in the book.	2005-02-05

About 1/5 of the book is dedicated to high maths about probability. In case you find the book too difficult, (as in my case), it shows that you (and me) dont belong to there, and we can never be pro gamblers who can win consistently in the long run against the unfavorable odds set by the casinos.

The lesson is old, simple and taught by every kindergartenteacher: Share with others. It applies to stocks and commodities as much as it does to crayons and toys. pg 24<br /><br />It is a world of make believe, where money grows on trees, dreams become reality, a Disneyland for adults. Almost everyone I meet wants to know how they can get into the business and make a fortune. When I discourage them from doing so, they only become more convinced, thinking that I am just trying to preserve a greater portion of the pot of gold for myself.

Unless you really wanna study academic theories about FX like different kinds of exchange rate regime or exchange rate model (which seldom held themselves), or get reasons to hedge your exposure \\"completely\\" for your company's or your own investment portfolio, please give this book a pass.	2005-01-26

Good for rookies	The author is definitely an avante garde in the field of intermarket analysis, considering the first version of this book was published in 1991. However, with the advance in IT, the sophistication of today's market, and that traders can easily \\"cross\\" and \\"correlate\\" whatever they want on a \\"trade station\\" PC platform, the material provided in this second version becomes much less helpful than what it's predecessor then offered to its readers over a decade ago. Though much had been updated, I am afraid it still can't satisfy the savvy investors/traders of the day. As a pragmatic reader/trader, I must complain that the author had told little about the skills/techniques for identification of inflationary/deflationary cycles and the respective opportunities in sector rotation, thus asset allocation and trading/investment strategies. However, the author did show that history apparently didnt repeat itself in the relationships between bonds, commodities, stock, and currencies. You will simply go bankrupt if you bet on a strategy that worked perfectly in the past.<br /><br />In case you are still not aware of the significance of the correlations of different classes of investment vehicles, this book can be quite a good start for you. If you are a veteran, please give this a pass.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some stuff that I think may be helpful (with a relatively high chance of recurrence) for your future investment/trading decision.<br /><br />In the past, inverted yield curves have usually marked the end of economic expansions and the end of bull markets in stocks. pg 99<br /><br />During a business cycle from early expansion to late contraction, various sectors thrive in the following order:- Transportation, technology, services, capital goods, basic materials, energy, consumer staples, utilities, financials, consumer cyclicals. pg 110<br /><br />Martin Pring divides the business cycle into six stages:- Bonds up, stocks up, commodities up, bonds down, stocks down, commodities down. pg 183n, stocks down, commodities down. pg 183 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-25

A real pager turner	The author, an ex-analyst of Morgan Stanley, talked of his personal encounters with some of the fallen angels of Wall Street (Mary Meeker is still there), the change in the role of analysts from research/brokerage support to investment banking/IPO tool that effectively broke the firewall/Long Wall between the two functions within the same company at investors' expense, and the interference of regulatory bodies that did more harm than good.<br /><br />To me, this is the second most interesting book of its kind, after Fiasco and better than Liar's Poker. It wont help your trading or investment, if you already know the uselessness (or how intoxicating in the author's term) of \\"recommendations\\" of those analysts who are paid in proportion to the qty and quality of suckers. The many bits and pieces are so interesting. If you wanna read for fun, this must be it.<br /><br />p.s. In case the term \\"Morgan Stanley\\" still means something to you, listen to Barton Biggs only, and neglect all else, especially Bryon Wien and Mary Meeker, in the author's opinion.	2005-01-20

But academic & beyond the grasp of the mass	This book is the author's challenge to the old financial orthodoxy (Efficient Market Hypotheis and its offsprings like CAPM, Efficient Frontier, Black-Scholes Model etc etc). In the author's own words in pg 23: This book will not make you rich...If it fits any genre, it is that of popular science...using common English, with as few formulae and as little mathematical jargon as possible - or at least, with no jargon unexplained...because I aim to stimulate broader debate about financial market modeling....that has hitherto been confined to the rarefied circles of economics-minded mathematicians or of mathematically inclined economists.<br /><br />To be honest, despite my CFA, MBA qualification with High School knowledge of Physics and Applied Maths., I can understand at most 80% of the author's message (definitely not the fractal geometry part and mostly the historical/statistical sections). I dont wanna frighten potential buyers/readers off. I am sure this is an excellent book. However, one should really consider his own ability and very non-trading/investment characteristics of the book.<br /><br />No matter what, I do appreciate much the author's own Ten Heresies of Finance:-<br /><br />1. Markets are turbulent<br />2. Markets are very, very risky - more risky than the standard theories imagine.<br />3. Market timing matters greatly. Big gains and losses concentrate into small packages of time.<br />4. Prices often leap, not glide. That adds to the risk.<br />5. In markets, time is flexible.<br />6. Markets in all places and ages work alike.<br />7. Markets are inherently uncertain, and bubbles are inevitable.<br />8. Markets are deceptive.<br />9. Forecasting Prices may be perilous, but you can estimate the odds of future volatility.<br />10. In financial markets, the idea of \\"value\\" has limited value.<br /><br />p.s. Some strong evidence suggested by the author (on top of the very difficult fractal geometry stuff) and some other interesting points are:-<br /><br />The standard theories would estimate the odds of that final August 31, 1998 collapse at one in 20 million, an event that, if you traded daily for nearly 100,000 years, you would not expect to see even one. The odds of getting three of such declines in the same month were even more minute: about one in 500 billion. pg 4<br /><br />From 1916 to 2003, theory suggests that there should be 58 days/ 6 days/once in 300,000 years for DJI daily movement over 3.4%/4.5%/7%. In fact, there were 1001 days/366 days/48 days of such event. pg 13<br /><br />A Citigroup study in 2002 found unpleasantly sharp price swings in several currencies....the biggest fall was a heart stopping 7.92% or 10.7 sigma. The normal odds of that: Not if Citigroup had been trading dollars and yen every day since the Big Bang 15 billion years ago should it have happened, not once. pg 97<br /><br />Continuity is a common human assumption. If we see a man running at one moment here and a half hour later there, we assume he has run a line covering the ground in between....Financial prices certainly jump, skip and leap...the principal conceptual difference between economics and classical physics. pg 237<br /><br />(An illustration) The Alps? The Mountains of the Moon? ....There is no geophysics in this diagram, only suitable randomness and fractality. The point is the same as in fractal finance: Chance alone can produce deceptively convincing patterns. pg 2461, 1998 collapse at one in 20 million, an event that, if you traded daily for nearly 100,000 years, you would not expect to see even one.

I dont mean to undermine the author in whatever sense. However, I had read at least two whole books about each of the five gurus (except Nicholas Darvas, which I had read only one) that the impression of copy and paste is really strong. In fact, I had read six out of the 12 books marked in the Bibliography section and it's so hard for me not to get that uneasy feeling of plagiarism.<br /><br />In case you had not heard of those gurus before, this book will be a huge treasure to you. If you had heard the great names but read only bits and pieces of them, this book will do you much good. If you had read books including \\"Reminiscences of a stock operator\\" about Jesse Livermore, \\"My own story\\" by Baruch,  \\"The battle for investment survival\\" by Gerald Loeb, \\"How I made $2 million in the stock market\\" by Nicholas Darvas and any book by William O'Neil, your liking of this book will drop inproportionately.<br /><br />p.s. I strongly recommend readers to buy and read the titles I mentioned above. The return on the money and time invested will be over a hundred fold.	2005-01-07

Depends on what you expect	If you expect this book as the sequel to the author's highly acclaimed \\"100 ways to motivate yourself\\" (I rated that a five star), you would very likely be disappointed.<br /><br />To give you an idea of what the book's about and to save your time on checking the content page available here on Amazon, below please find the 17 lies/chapters for your quick reference:-<br /><br />L1. It's who you know<br />L2. There's something wrong with me<br />L3. I'm too old for that<br />L4. I cant because I'm afraid<br />L5. I'd love to do that, but I dont have the time<br />L6. There's nothing I can do<br />L7. I worry because I care<br />L8. I'm sadder now but wiser<br />L9. The longer I have a habit, the harder it is to break<br />L10. People really upset me<br />L11. Winning the lottery would solve everything<br />L12. They're too beautiful for this world<br />L13. You hurt my self esteem<br />L14. It's a shame we didnt capture that on video<br />L15. That's just the way I am<br />L16. What (alcohol and drugs) doesnt kill me make me stronger<br />L17. I am helpless<br /><br />If those lies happen to be your problems, you may find it helpful, though I deem the quoted examples in each chapter few and timid, which is the very reason I dont like this book much. Also, there are just too many blank pages.<br /><br />In short, much better alternatives are available in a bookstore, like the author's own \\"100 ways to motivate yourself\\".<br /><br />p.s. No matter what, I do like the following quotes in the book.<br /><br />Whatever we learn to do, we learn by actually doing it. People come to be builders, for instance, by building, and harp players by playing the harp. In the same way, by doing just acts we come to be just. By doing self-controlled acts, we come to be self-controlled, and by doing brave acts we become brave.<br />- Artistole pg 25<br /><br />The word enthusiasm comes from the Greek en theos, which means \\"the God within.\\" If that's what enthusiasm means, you can figure out what the opposite of enthusiasm is. pg 98<br /><br />The real truth is that the wiser you are, the happier you get. Because wisdom does that. If one is becoming sadder, it's not because one is becoming wiser, it is because one is quitting. One is giving up. She left me for another, so i quit. pg 100<br /><br />There are many ways to victimize people. One way is to convince them that they are victims.<br />- Karen Huang pg 135se wisdom does that. If one is becoming sadder, it's not because one is becoming wiser, it is because one is quitting. One is giving up. She left me for another, so i quit. pg 100    There are many ways to victimize people. One way is to convince them that they are victims.   - Karen Huang pg 135	2005-01-04

Essential for any christian's spiritual growth	The pastors serving my church always quote this book in their sermons. So, blame it on my pride and stupidity, I had neglected it for long. I had been very wrong. Though it's just about 200 pages, it is the most concentrated (think of Uranium 235) spiritual dose I had ever taken. With no nonsense, the 3 parts (Inward/Outward/Corporate Disciplines) of 12 topics including Meditation, Prayer, Fasting, Study, Simplicity, Solitude, Submission, Service, Confession, Worship, Guidance and Celebration, simply (in my opinion as a baptised Christian for over 2 decades and somebody who read tens of Christian books) give every Christian the essential armor or weaponry to fight their spiritual wars on earth. It's the best combination of simple words, great teachings and excellent writing skill. In short, a must read.	2004-12-11

I like it much. That's for sure. However, it's so strategic (On the other hand, the author's another book \\"What matters most? The power of living your values\\" is even more strategic or less tactical)that talks much about the importance and benefits of time and life management. For those who dont know so, you will definitely gain much if you start acting on them. However, for those who want to further improve themselves and sharpen their edge by learning more tactical advice, they might not be very satisfied. For your own judgement, below please find a copy and paste of the 10 Laws. Hope you find them helpful.<br /><br />Part I Managing your time:-<br /><br />L1: You control your life by controlling your time<br />L2: Your governing values are the foundation of personal success and fulfillment<br />L3: When your daily activities reflect your governing values, you experience inner peace.<br />L4: To reach any significant goal, you must leave your comfort zone.<br />L5: Consistent daily planning leverages time and increases focus.<br /><br />Part II Managing your life<br />L6: Your behavior is a reflection of what you truly believe.<br />L7: You satisfy needs when your beliefs are in line with reality.<br />L8: Negative behaviors are overcome by changing incorrect beliefs<br />L9: Your self-esteem must ultimately come from within.<br />L10: Give more and you'll have more.<br /><br />p.s. I like the chapter on Law 10 the most. It's the author's own story of how to give more and have more by being a servant leader in the army. Really enlightening.	2004-12-11

However, I still rate it a good book for common readers who just want to work better and make life easier. Below please find my views that counter the negative comment above:-<br /><br />Those who expect a 180 page book to teach \\"anybody\\" to do \\"anything\\" might just overexpect; The author admits the manipulative nature of his recommendations in page 54; It's natural for a book with 40 chapters to be relatively tactical than strategic. Otherwise, it will become sheer talk of little practical value; For fans and intellects of psychology, look elsewhere. In fact, please make sure you had completed the 18 volumes of Sigmund Freud before your complaint against others' lack of depth; If it works, it works. A patient goes to a doctor for recovery from illness, not medical knowledge with originality.<br /><br />In short, a good and interesting read, something that can be put on your desk for quick reference in a variety of situations that can save you a lot of trouble.	2004-12-07

Despite the title of my review, I didnt expect this book to give me solid answers to theological questions that only God Himself can reply. However, I couldnt stop myself from expecting much from the same author who gave me divine experience with his classics like  \\"The Bible Jesus read\\", \\"Finding God in unexpected places\\", \\"Where is God when it hurts?\\", \\"The Jesus I never knew\\", \\"Soul Survivor\\", and my all time favorite \\"What's so amazing about grace?\\".<br /><br />Some reviewers comment that this is a very deep and difficult book. However, I really think that the author has been improving himself so much over time that his recent works are much better than this one which is a collection of his essays first published on Christianity Today before 1989. In this respect, I should congratulate the author and thank God for using the author to preach His messages so well. However, as a consumer and a common christian, I am obligated to recommend the author's other books (like those mentioned above) instead of this one.	2004-11-16

Ironically, the author had reserved only 18 pages for his renowned \\"Laternal Thinking\\", that he had gone thru related methods of \\"Stepping Stone\\" (treat an idea of its movement value instead of just its judgement value), \\"Escape\\" (think of alternatives for things we take for granted) and \\"Random stimulation\\" (open ourselves to influence other than those we directly look for).<br /><br />What had been written so far might seem rather a collection of jargons than an organised passage with clear objectives. However, I assure you that you will get the same bad feeling from reading the book. Perhaps the author had published so many books that it became too hard for him to write a new one with original, flesh, and practical examples and ideas at all. In that case you really want to read something from de Bono, the \\"Six Thinking Hats\\" is a much better choice.	2004-11-15

The reason why \\"Good Luck\\" is so outstanding is that it tells the whole thing, how somebody can enjoy \\"good luck\\" consistently, in a very interesting and memorable story that one can hardly forget and can even reinforce itself through telling it to others. I think most people know the principles, and so a good reminder (two knights in a forest) will work very well. In fact, the style of this book is a close resemblance of \\"Who moved my cheese?\\", though I think \\"Good Luck\\" is even better, both content and story writing wise.<br /><br />For your information, I bought this book because I was told over 800k of the Japanese translation of this \\"Spanish\\" book had been sold. I believe it will be a worldwide bestseller in the forseeable future. If you dont wanna miss something great, get one and read it ASAP!	2004-11-13

Higher their ranks, more applicable the strategies/tactics can be.

Perhaps the author's method is so simple and straightforeward that the book is really short, despite the addition of his autobiography and interesting personal experience, say, his encounter with two persons who quitted their job for full time trading before the burst of 2000 Internet Bubble.<br /><br />I am obligated to comment it as an interesting read. However, the captioned method is not so practical to common investors who lack the patience/scale to carry on such mode of operation, unless they restrict their scope of monitoring to a limited number of stock, thus drastically reduced the number of opportunities available. So I gave the title of my review as it is. If you have already read many trading books before, you can take it as a supplement. Otherwise, you may spend your $16 more productively on some other investment or trading books.	2004-10-23

A good book, but not as outstanding as	the author's first book \\"The 10 natural laws of time and life management\\" which got a better balance of strategies and tactics.<br /><br />According to page 66, the primary objective of the book is to help readers close the gap between what they really value and what they are doing, which the author describe as the most excruciating kind of pain. Along such, the author \\"prescribed\\" : \\"Burn it into memory. Wake up each morning and ask yourself, \\"What am I going to do today to close the gap between what I am doing and what really matters most to me?\\"\\" In my opinion, the author had been very successful in achieving his goal. This is a very enjoyable book under the author's very good writing skill. I might have rated it a five star if I had not read \\"The 10 natural laws\\" before this.<br /><br />Below please find some passages I love for your reference. Hope you can have a better grasp of the strengths of this book.<br /><br />Page 64: Why New Year Resolutions don't work? Part of the problem is that we have the cart before the horse. We think that by simply setting out a few vague goals, behavior changes will miraculously happen. Setting goals is important and necessary, but it's not the place to begin. My suggestion is that you delay writing resolutions until you have identified your governing values, those things in life that matter most to you, those things without which you would find life meaningless or unfulfilling, those things that lie at heart of who you are and who you hope to become.<br /><br />Pg 150: The most effective tool I have discovered in whipping the demons is to have regular victories in my life every single day. When you do something right, take a moment and savor the feeling. Even a little victory does wonders for your confidence and motivation. Make a conscious effort to successfully complete some task each day related to something that really matters to you. That'll help keep the demons at bay.<br /><br />Pg 151: There are many types of diseases that afflict the human body, and we spend millions and perhaps billions of dollars trying to find cures.

In fact, this is by far the best I had come across on Convertible Arbitrage. It's so informative and well written that it should be a handbook for hedge fund professionals or finance professors. However, it's far beyond the comprehension of the investment public who would surely be confused by the vast amount of greek alphabets, financial equations and graphs. Of course, for those affluent readers (time- and money-wise) who want to learn, say, Bearish Tilt Gamma Convertible Hedge, Vega Hedge thru Volatility Swap etc. despite the technicalities and scale issues facing individual investors, it's definitely not a bad bet.	2004-10-13

The author suggests that by putting one hat/perspective at a time, thinking and thus problem solving will be much enhanced, both on an individual and on a group discussion setting when all participants are required to put on the same color of hats together sequentially.<br /><br />Of course the reality is more complicated and difficult than what the author paints as office politics always come into play. Nevertheless, this book reminds me of \\"Who Moved My Cheese? An Amazing Way to Deal with Change in Your Work and in Your Life by Spencer Johnson and Kenneth H. Blanchard\\" in that readers can easily recall the concept well. Anyway, it's an outstanding book not to be missed.	2004-10-13

However, the fundamental differences are insurmountable. Christians pray to Jesus and God for deliverance. Buddhists meditate to get solutions from within. Christians refer to the Bible for ultimate direction. Buddhists are not encouraged to stick to any \\"book\\" at all. Christians dont believe in reincarnation. Buddhists do. Jesus and the Holy Spirit \\"is\\" the one and only Creator. Buddhism talks vaguely little about the origin of life. In fact, what disturbed me most is the author's equating Buddha to Jesus and Mindfulness to the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />I am not advocating intolerance nor rivalry against Buddhists nor Buddhism. My wife is a quasi Buddhist (a lot of Hong Kong people regards themselves to be) and our marriage is quite against the teaching in the New Testament. In my opinion, Buddhism, in particular the Zen tradition, is a great lifestyle or philosophy to be seriously studied and followed, but not a religion of (before) life and death (after). Buddhists can be just the same lovely and lovable as any christian, and we shouldnt label or judge anyone by what one believes. Actions always talk louder than empty words.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a good book for thought, though I think it might be more suitable for Christians who have a solid understanding of their own religion, say, through study of the whole Bible several times. For interested christians who want to look into this area about living with both Christianity and Buddhism, I would strongly recommend the book \\"The Silence of Unknowing: The key to the Spiritual Life\\" by Terence Grant.k \\"The Silence of Unknowing: The key to the Spiritual Life\\" by Terence Grant.	2004-09-24

I supposed this book could tell me a lot how \\"successful\\" hedge funds operated and profited (I inferred so from the word \\"Giants\\" on the title of the book and the back cover which promised to explain the strategies and techniques they employ). However, all I could read was plenty of charts, tables and sales talks, very general in nature, the stuff one could get from any hedge fund sales brochure displayed inside a bank.<br /><br />If you wanna know why successful hedge funds profit so, you will be absolutely disappointed. If you wanna select a fund or two from the sea of choices nowadays which suit your investment objectives (profit making for sure) and risk appetite, you will be very disappointed as well. In the rare case you need to write a sales brochure for a hedge fund that you need to put everything positive but vague, it's for you.	2004-09-23

It could be a bible for anyone working in a bank or government institutions who need to monitor risk and legal issues concerning the very sophisticated hedge fund operations. This may be attributed to the very strong academic background of the author. However, it certainly goes far beyond the need and understanding of the general investment public or even professional traders like me whose primary objective may just be to profit, and profit. Therefore the value of it depends much on who the reader is and what he wants. No matter what, the quality of the book and the sincerity of the author can be much appreciated.	2004-09-23

Neverthless, I put it on my Listmania List for Traders for years. Today, after I finished the expanded edition, I removed it from my Listmania List. I admit that my expectation had been raised. I am not satisfied with histories/philosophies/tactics of highly successful trend followers. I already buy into the Trend Following Strategy so the tons of arguments from the author against \\"Buy and Hold\\" become meaningless to me. I want to look more into each, for something that I can readily copy and profit. In short, still a good (but over stretched) introduction to trend following. Readable with plenty of quotes from great traders, but definitely not on any aspiring trend followers/traders top priority list.	2004-09-23

I rated \\"How to make anyone fall in love with you\\" by the same author a four star. I think this book is even better, and certainly more applicable in general circumstances. Though I dont agree with the author's mildly negative comment on Dale Carnegie's classic \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" who wrote in the Introduction that Dale's book is not good enough for the much more complicated world nowadays, I would rather say Dale's book focused on mindset and strategies, whilst this one gave you many useful tactics. Both should be read seriously, if you want to be a successful warrier in the business jungle. Highly recommended!<br /><br /> <br /><br />p.s. The tactic I like most is called \\"The Tombstone Game\\" in page 226 Technique 59:- Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but dont mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say I appreciate you ro I love you, fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier.

With regard to this book, the good things are: The author did not promote his tool as something invincible. He talked about the limitations of and warned readers of the need for continuous revision. Very smooth writing and an easy read. The bad things are: BB is not really a sophisticated tool at all. So the author had \\"filled\\" it up with some stuff that seemed light or marginally helpful to readers who had read over five trading books. I am afraid that comprises of most of the potential buyers coz I think it's hard for novices to spend over thirty bucks for a book that talks only of one single TA tool. Furthermore, I really cant acquire extra knowledge of BB from this book that distinguishes it from other TA books I read before.<br /><br />Anyway, I still think this is a good read. Afterall, it costs less than one pip in some futures market and you can definitely save a lot more in case you can use BB to enhance your trading system as the author suggests.	2004-09-14

However, the book is not that repetitive and it's a fun read with the author's excellent writing skill. In case you just want a short and interesting book (the title is great) that focuses on procrastination with less coverage of time and life management, this is it. Nevertheless, a drawback may be that many ideas here had been presented in the author's previous books. (I had read three Tracy books before this) Anyway, wish you all tasty frog (things that you keep procrastinating) meals! Enjoy!	2004-09-09

Not common stuff practical for personal investors but for model fund managers with abundant technical and administrative support, right? No matter what, it's a good read to me as a professional trader, but not for long term investment public, for sure.<br /><br />p.s.

I respect Rubin as a very capable person who did great things in his term as the Secretary of Treasury. However, I really dont enjoy his book at all. I did expect him to tell many inside stories or insights about the Mexican crisis in 95, Asian Crisis in 97 and the Russian/LTCM Crisis in 98. So disappointed that his coverage of them is so impersonal, light and even dry. All you can read is Rubin's praise of Clinton, Greenspan and Summers. In fact, you can hardly find a passage where Rubin criticized strongly any person at all, except a Korean minister whose name had not been disclosed! Though he emphasized regularly the significance of his probabilistic way of decison making which he acquired through his trading and management life in Goldman, readers can learn little of his philosophy with his so diplomatic and restrained covering of simply anything in the book, even those long gone days in Goldman.<br /><br />In case you want to read a bio of an outstanding person who can carry his success from the private sector to the public one and \\"survived\\" with honor, this book is okay.

In my opinion, the author had delivered multi-dimensional arguments (of time, culture, history, politics from many respected academics) against the suspicions raised by Dan Brown's book, that Jesus had \\"lived\\" to marry Mary of Magdalene, Constantine had \\"overhauled\\" the Bible in A.D. 325 and so on. Of course, nobody can perfectly win the case unless we can travel in a time machine or Jesus suddenly shows up before us and tells it himself. However, I think this book can help christian readers to apply good probabilistic thinking to judge for themselves what \\"truths\\" we should really believe.<br /><br />I can understand that many readers dislike the book for the very strong or passionate poise the author took to defend his faith against the popularity of Dan Brown's book as an authentic history and not a fiction. As a non christian colleague of mine who borrowed it from me said, \\"The harder the author tries, the less trustworthy he seems.\\" What a pity that my colleague knows very little and has no interest at all about the conflicts amongst the early christians for the orthodox beliefs (well documented before A.D. 325), the unsolvable discrepancies between the \\"maintream\\" gospels and those gnostic gospels (It's impossible to accept different personalities of the disciples amongst different gospels), the cultural background and the history of Jews (Jews, the Middle East people, and the Romans in those days never cared nor respected the role of women like the way we do in the 21st century as opposed to what Dan Brown wrote), and most importantly, what Jesus' death and his subsequent rise to heaven means. Such knowledge will largely enhance his appreciation of the whole picture and that he may not judge the book primarily with the style of the author. (If his rise did not happen, he's not the one which the prophets in the Old Testaments told about the coming Messiah and Christianity is no more than a fiction).<br /><br />Perhaps if the author had not picked an over confident title, the receptance of the book could be much improved.

Enlightening, esp the part on love making	I had read a few books about courtship or heterogenous love, but not one solely on making love or having sex. I dont mean this book belongs to the later group. However, on top of the useful but common techniques (separate for hunter and hunteress), the last few chapters devoted to making love and having sex really makes it outstanding above the rest. The table which the author used to tell the contrast (and thus differences on what men and women think about good sex) between female porn and male porn is hilarious but true (to the detriment of my self esteem). However, the most important message for me rests on the author's suggestion to read romance novels published by Harlequin. The few pages 247-251 (that 5 pages worth the price of the whole book) of a partial story the author used to elaborate (in a choregraphy format) the perfect setup to turn on a woman and drive her crazy really brought me to a level far beyond my previous reach. I tried it the day after I completed this book and the effect was so amazing.<br /><br />In short, a must read. I am sure that this book will open a new horizon for many \\"common male\\" like me.<br /><br />p.s. In order to avoid any bad impression that I or the book is sheerly sex related, below please find some of my favorite techniques mentioned in the book.<br /><br />No. 33 Employ Empathizers: Dust your discussion with phrases like \\"I see what you mean.\\" \\"Yes, you were right.\\" \\"I can related to that,\\" and the all time favorite, \\"I understand.\\"<br /><br />No. 59 \\"How do you feel about that?\\": Whatever she is discussing, simply ask that.

There were discussing illustrious figures of the past when one suddenly asked, \\"Gentlemen, what would we do if Milton were to enter this room?\\" \\"We would give him such an ovation as might compensate...\\" \\"And if Shakespeare?\\" asked another. \\"We would arise and crown him master of song.\\" \\"And if Jesus Christ?\\" Charles Lamb amid an intense silence, \\"We would all fall upon our faces.\\"<br /><br />Pg 79: A certain minister seldom preached more than twenty minutes. When one of his faithful listeners requested that he make his sermons longer, the pastor replied, \\"If you practice all I preach, you will find them long enough.\\"	2004-08-24

It's so humorous, and even sacrastic. However, the objective of it seems to help you get laid and thus full of short term tactics, with no long term strategies at all to win a lady's heart. Not much had been said on the manipulation of emotions like jealousy, gratitude and admiration, which had been stressed both in the beginning and ending of the book. Furthermore, there's very weak association of Machiavelli's teachings with those of the author.<br /><br />In case you just want a leisure read, it's more than okay. If you wanna find a book that can help you to win somebody's love, go somewhere else.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find a copy and paste of some points on pg 112/3 of the topic \\"answers to common excuses\\". I think they are quite representative of the book's general style.<br /><br />F: I dont know you.<br />M: I dont know you very well, either. Do I let it bother me?<br />F: I'm having my period.<br />M: That's great! This is the one time of the month you dont need any protection.<br />F: I'm not in the mood.<br />M; Let me lick you for two minutes, then tell me you're not in the mood.<br />F: You're not just not my type.<br />M: Close your eyes and pretend it's someone else.<br />F: But it's our first date.<br />M: Dont think of it as our first date. Think of it as our last date.<br />F: We have such a beautiful friendship, I dont want to ruin it this way.<br />M: Are you kidding? This will make it deeper and more meaningful!<br />F: But I have a boyfriend.<br />M; Dont worry. I wasnt planning on telling him.<br />And the author even added, \\"There is almost no insurmountable excuse for withholding the booty.\\"	2004-08-20

Dont wanna write about the merits and content here coz those are well covered by other reviewers. Instead, wanna explain why I rate it a four star instead of a five.<br /><br />1. I was impressed, but not moved. That might be personal but I really think that more real life stories and prayer samples can be added to enhance my understanding of the author's messages and my ability to pray different kinds of prayer. The association of only one prayer in the end of individual chapter/category/aspect is insufficent, and sometimes inadequate (I admit that it might just be my ignorance)<br /><br />2. The writing is a bit dry and not well organised. Seeming overlap of supposedly different kind/aspect of prayers is frequent. I think the author could summarize his ideas in point or table form for better understanding by common christians like me. The inclusion of stories/quotes of spiritual leaders is great, but sometimes odd and incoherent in context.<br /><br />3. Though the author emphasized that \\"love\\" is central to various kinds of prayer in both the beginning and the end of the book, such linkage is transparent to me.<br /><br />Despite the above minor drawbacks, in case you wanna learn more about prayers, it is a superb choice. However, it might not be a good option for those who read to learn praying smoothly and fluently to suit different occasions and personal needs.<br /><br />p.s. I like the \\"Three Hermits\\", a story by Tolstoy in the book very much. In summary, on an island there lived three old hermits. The only prayer they used was: 'We are three; Thou art Three-have mercy on us!' The local bishop heard about that and decided to visit them in order to teach them the canonical invocations. On his return trip, he saw, following the ship, a radiant light. As it approached, he discerned the three hermits, who were holding hands and running upon the waves in an effort to overtake the vessel. 'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.' The awed bishop shook his head. 'Dear ones,' he replied humbly, 'continue to live with your old prayer!'ke the vessel. 'We have forgotten the prayers you taught us,' they cried as they reached the bishop, 'and have hastened to ask you to repeat them.' The awed bishop shook his head.

A must for any long term stock investor	The following two quotes always jumped into my mind when I was reading this book:- \\"No pain no gain\\" and \\"Talent is spelt W-O-R-K\\".<br /><br />Back to the book. It's a real page turner with plenty of  success stories that explained the phenomenal return of the fund managed by the author, a genuine value investing practitioner, who began the book with some investment basics like do your homework and never listen to tips, then followed by intensive description of spinoffs, partial spinsoffs, rights offerings, risk arbitrage, mergers, bankruptcy, restructuring, and various derivatives.<br /><br />Nothwithstanding the author's humour, this book is exceptionally insightful. I love the quick summaries for individual tools much because they are so concise and helpful. In case you are committed to do your homework (several weeks to study for just one single opportunity), and you are patient enough to invest only on around five opportunities in a year, this book is a must buy!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some summaries for your quick reference:-<br /><br />For spinoff<br />1. Spinoffs, in general, beat the market.<br />2. Picking your spots within the spinoff universe for even better result.<br />3.

Tracy and Robbins are the two best writers/speakers of the league, in my opinion. However, perhaps I am not flexible enough, I really could not connect myself to this travel log of Brian (the predominant style and content of the book) interwoven with his wise and encouraging messages.

As a shortcut to the best of Schuller's powerful, positive quotes (I copied the phrase from the backcover), this book is great. However, it's just so short with only 61 pages of messages (normally one message for each page in size 16 or 18 Times New Roman font) that you think you should get more with the size and price of it.<br /><br />In short, I think those \\"standard\\" books of Schuller will satisfy readers more with the usual contextual setup. If you had not read Schuller's books before, this may not work for you in case you wanna get solid encouragement in the midst of life's disappointments. If you are a fan of Schuller and wanna buy a small gift for your friend, \\"Success is never ending\\" can be a better choice, which contains all quotes in this book except those god related ones.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find those quotes I like most for your ref.:-<br /><br />- You will never win if you never begin. Starting is half the battle.<br />- When every other element is out of control, remember you can still manage your reaction.<br />- Trouble is not always trouble! It is often God's way of making us lie down, turn around, sit still, pray, work harder, or start over again.<br />- Talent is spelled W-O-R-K.<br />- You must take the leap of faith to experience God's saving strength!<br />- Happy are the believers, for they need never worry.<br />- There will never be another now, so I'll make the most of today.. there will never be another me, so I'll make the most of myself.<br />- Tough times never last, but tough people do!	2004-08-16

I never expected that an ex-president, supposed to be pragmatic and rational, can have written such a beautiful, sensational, clear and to the point spiritual book. Not a few messages, but fifty-two meaningful and insightful ones in this 241 page book. The format is traditional, with three to four pages of elaboration on a particular biblical verse. Nevertheless, the impact is great and you really feel your faith and spiritual strength being enhanced through reading it, of course with intermittent prayers in between for optimal effect. I dont want to comment it as a tool book, but it does serves its purpose really well.<br /><br />In short, a great read not to be missed! It's the best and the least difficult spiritual book I had read in months, after the intense round of five to six Philip Yancey books I read about half a year before, which I still deem them the very best amongst all christian books.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find two good passages for your reference:-<br /><br />Pg 74: The context for Jesus's stories about the Samaritans, ...For Samaritan, substitute black, Muslim, AIDS, Haitian - or perhaps roll them all into one! ... His acknowledging the gratitude of the healed leper and using a Samaritan's actions as epitomizing the Golden Rule are powerful lessons against prejudice.<br /><br />Pg 112: We argue incessantly about separation of church and state, the priesthood of believers, ordination of women, prayer in schools, gay rights, predestination ... and any number of other \\"crucial\\" issues. Perhaps worse than the Corinthians, we forget the solid, unquestionable, unifying foundation of our faith in in the gentle Jesus, full of grace and truth.

I wanted the 307 page full version but I had received this 3\\"x3.8\\" less than 50 pages gift book version. Nevertheless, I am not really disappointed at all because this one is really cute and portable, good for both personal use or for passing on.<br /><br />Let's get back to the book. Though very short and light, it's heavy in substance. All messages, normally one on each page, are based on the premise that \\"Success is never ending, failure is never final.\\" In fact, I think a book title of \\"Failure is never final\\" is more pertinent.<br /><br />Some messages which I like most include:-<br /><br />- A year from now you may wish you had started from today<br /><br />- Plan your day and work your plan<br /><br />- Everyone faces disappointments at one time or another, but the winners are the ones who refuse to let disappointments become discouragements.<br /><br />In short, a value for money purchase!<br /><br />Warning: Most, or simply all messages in this book are included in \\"The Little Book of Hope\\" by the same author. In you want to buy a book for yourself and you are a Christian, \\"The Little Book\\" is a better choice, though it's double in size (but not double the amount of messages) of this one.	2004-08-16

Wide but sufficiently deep	I had read over a hundred trading books by far and written many reviews here on Amazon. This is the first time I used the term \\"book of books\\" to tell how far an author had tried to incorporate the trading ideas/concepts/rules of other gurus into his book. I dont mean that this book is simply a product of copy and paste. I believe the author had the good intention of covering as many \\"classic\\" strategies as possible to deliver the promise of the book title to his readers. In my opinion, most of the essential trading psychology concepts had been there.<br /><br />This book is divided into three main parts. The first one tries to break popular trading misconceptions/errors with topics like no holy grail, myth of expert, marketitis (overtrading), tickeritis (too close to a quote screen), price-news drug effect (too easy access to prices, news and analyses), damage from tips or rumors, cult of guru, greener pastures effect (survival bias of industry funds), pride of opinion, specific difficulties facing successful businessmen and so on. The second part is about contrary opinion. Historical big crashes are discussed, as well as means to avoid or even profit from them.  The third part is primarily rules and regulations of legends like Warren Buffet, John Templeton, Paul Tudor Jones, Bernard Baruch, W.D. Gann etc, and those developed by the author himself.<br /><br />I agree with some reviewers that the author's writing is quite dry. To me, that's acceptable because it's not easy to elaborate with vivid words and stories, or the book will be far more than 265 pages. It would be eye opening for those who had read less than three trading psychology books. For serious trader readers, this book is still satisfying with the opportunities provided for the traders' own health check. Not a must, but certainly a valuable asset in one's own trading library.<br /><br />Warning: Though my comment above is quite positive, please take this as a reference book only before you completely understand yourself and your best trading style. Otherwise, the third part of the book may lead you to become a Jack of all trades and thus meat for your fellow traders/investors.and your best trading style.

And no matter how complex our schedule becomes, no matter how many pressures we feel, our life becomes easier because we continually look to God for direction. Every decision, every plan, can then be judged according to whether it fits into God's plan for our lives.\\" To elaborate the above, the author interrelated her experience of a walk around a lake in a summer morning with her reflections of biblical teachings and modern time management techniques. The availability of self help tests like \\"Lifestyle Inventory Test\\", \\"A Money Autobiography\\" and \\"Evaluate Your Activities\\" etc had much enhanced the book to an effective tool beyond the scope of a sheer spiritual reading.<br /><br />In short, it is a good tool for all practicing christians who dont want to lose their directions or minds in their fast paced business jungles.

Helpful for all walks of life	Before I read it, I took this as an ordinary time management book (see the clock-shaped &quot;O&quot; in the word DONE in the front cover) about prioritization, planning, procrastination, delegation with some tactics on phone calls, how to say no and so on, inexplicity targeting those with middle to upper management positions. However, I still picked it up for its enchanting tagline &quot;how to achieve stress-free productivity&quot;.<br /><br /> To my surprise, this book's quality is well beyond my expectation. Beside the usual stuff described above, there are plenty of productive tidbits on, say, filing, drawers, checklists, clips, paper notes etc etc., with Zen style messages and idioms furnishing those very practical and easy to use models for choosing actions in the moment, evaluating daily work and so on. The insertion of small dialogue boxes beside keypoint paragraphs certainly helps readers much to grasp important ideas. Backed by the author's good writing skill, readers can complete the whole book with ease and reward.<br /><br /> Seldom I rate a self help book 5 stars but this one really deserves the highest mark. In short, a must read!<br /><br /> p.s. One of its very productive tips can be found in page 131. &quot;If the next action can be done in two minutes or less, do it when you first pick the item up. Even if the item is not a high priority one, do it now if you're ever going to do it at all. The rationale for &quot;the two-minute rule&quot; is that that's more or less the point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal with it the first tiem it's in your hands - in other words, it's the efficiency cutoff.&quot;	2004-08-04

That's for sure. In fact, the author had been honest not to over promise with the humble title of his book. The scope of discussion is limited to chart patterns, trendlines, channels, moving averages, Fibonnaci numbers, MACD, Stochastics, RSI and a few others. As the author had emphasized his objective to make his book only an introduction to TA, I am not going to comment on the variety of TA tools covered. However, I still want to criticize on some of the weaknesses:<br />1) Number of real life examples/price charts are few.<br />2) The choice of parameters for MACD and Stochastics had not been discussed<br />3) False breakouts are so frequent in the author's graphs samples (that's a fact of life, I admit). However, the author made little attempt to teach readers how to avoid such traps with the use of multiple TA tools.<br />4) The relative weak Q&A sections that questions are focused on readers' understanding of the definition of jargons instead of the usage of TA tools.<br /><br />Though the price is affordable, I am hesitant to recommend it to any aspiring trader/investor who are serious to get an elementary but quality course on TA. It's not the cost of the book that matters, but the cost of time and potential trading loss for reading it.	2004-08-04

It's just so hard to give you a summary of a book that provides little substance at all. In short, the author used five chapters on economics/psychology/expectations/sentiment, two chapters on TA tools including Market Profile, Long Term Market Activity Chart, two chapters on merging the former paragraphs into the author's Coherent Market Theory and then Sentiment-Activity Model, and five chapters to illustrate the power of the Model on T-Bond, Sobbeans, DM and Crude Oil. Well, does that look like the thesis you and I did in colleges? It doesnt really matter if the ideas are useful and applicable. However, they are not. It's simply not practical at all for any genuine trader, not to mention the low possibility of any reader to understand the usage of Market Profile and LTMA Chart with the little coverage of them in the book. Besides, the writing of the author is really boring.<br /><br />  Very green trader reader may find the first few chapters interesting, but they will certainly get lost from chapter five onwards and can hardly move to chapter seven. In case you got plenty of time and money to waste, that's fine. If not, go for some book else.<br /><br />  p.s. I can hardly believe that the author is a FX trader, and had traded commodities and cash bond for Fortune 500 companies as well. I might prefer him to write books about his trading life instead of giving a long useless lecture on something useless.	2004-08-03

He had used 76 out of his 229 page book to elaborate the &quot;real failure stories&quot; of Gann, Larry Williams, Richard Dennis, and the absurdities of Elliot waves and Fibonacci numbers.<br /><br /> I am not going to judge this book by its controversial opinion which most TA traders would disagree (please refer to the spotlight review by trader75. It's excellent). I just want to warn all novice trader readers that in case you dont know well about your own trading style or trading edge, dont read this book. In my opinion, both TA and FA are simply tools for profit making, the choice of it depending much on the traders' own personalitites, strengths and weaknesses that nobody else can really tell. Unless you had been completely ripped off twice (the author's standard of a successful trader, if the trader can still persist), I am afraid that you might not truly understand what your true nature is and may get confused by the author's very sophisticated arguments. Afterall, reading is meant for profitable trading, isnt it?<br /><br /> To me, this book is quite a fun read with good coverage on money management and trading psychology (discipline/technical (not TA)/mechanical trading), a good reminder of the limit of TA and a mind cleansing tool for the unwanted residue of my unplesant trading life. If you enjoy reading something really skeptical, go for it. Otherwise, please give it a pass.	2004-08-03

Understandably the authors didnt want to indirectly encourage readers to diagnose and prognose for their own, instead of going to sleep disorder experts or physicians. Inevitably, the attractiveness and usefulness of the book had been much reduced.<br /><br /> On the other hand, the writing skill of the &quot;doctors&quot; was really bad. The use of long paragraphs, with the absence of summary, bullet points and tables really deter readers from getting the most from the book.<br /><br /> In short, if one just wanna learn more about sleep, this is certainly a good book to look at. For medical advice, one should go to a sleep disorders center directly.	2004-07-29

It's still selling okay on Amazon and you know it's really a classic.<br /><br /> The content is as ordinary as what you can expect from any time management book. However, you got to accept that it's the avante garde of its day and the regular revision of it allows it to stay fresh. Topics include: Time management is essentially life management. Prioritize. Plan. Tactics to fight off unexpected phone calls, drop in visitors, procrastination, delegation, learn to say no blah blah blah. In particular I like very much those sample spreadsheets (the author called them matrix) for contingency, priorization, contact log etc much. Appendixes in the last chapter that summarize tactics for various symptoms or traps are really helpful.<br /><br /> In short, a good read that's value for time and money!<br /><br /> p.s. I like the section of &quot;Misconceptions about time management&quot; on page 11 and 12 the most. Those very logical and intelligent Q&A simply worths over half of the price of the book to me. Some copy and paste for your reference are:-<br /><br /> Q: Time management takes away your freedom, and I'm a spontaneous sort of person. A: &quot;True freedom comes through discipline. Suppose you were suddenly offered an opportunity to stay at a friend's house....Are you organized enough to reschedule your work so you could go? That's freedom!&quot;<br /><br /> Q: Time management might be good for some kinds of work, but my job is very creative. I cant be tied to a routine. A: &quot;Time management is not fundamentally about routine; it's about self discipline....It gives you time to be creative. It frees your mind of the worry and tedious detail that stand in the way of creative thinking.&quot;<br /><br /> Q: The stuff they teach you in time management is a lot of work. I dont have time to do all that. A: &quot;You dont have time not to. Keepinga time log and writing a daily plan may be new to you...Once you learn how, a few minutes can save you hours.&quot;, a few minutes can save you hours.&quot;  <br />	2004-07-29

Buy strong stocks in strong sectors in an upward-trending market<br /><br /> R2. Short weak stocks in weak sectors in a downward-trending market<br /><br /> R3. Stay out of the market and in cash when there is no definable trend.<br /><br /> S1. Diagnose and prognose on corporate earnings news, flow of macroeconomic data, conduct of fiscal and monetary policy of govt, and exogenous shocks like wars and rain in Brazil, the so called four dynamic factors.<br /><br /> S2. Determine broad market and individual sector trends wrt business cycle, stock market cycle and interest rate cycle.<br /><br /> S3. Screen individual stock thru fundamental and technical analysis.<br /><br /> S4. Uses risk/money/trade management tools<br /><br /> The author said that this book is for all. As a professional trader, I believe that it is much more suitable for amateur long term stock investors who favors fundamental analysis. The coverage on S1 and S2 are brilliant, but not for S3 and S4. Serious investors should read some books else to compliment the inadequacies on TA and risk/money management.<br /><br /> In short, a good book. The Q&A and resource reference in the end of each chapter is very helpful. A value buy!	2004-07-25

The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.<br />I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. I just wanna say that there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a low cost reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA without the introduction of other tools like Fibonacci, Moving Average, MACD, Stochastics etc. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal.	2004-07-16

Curisoita - An insatiably curious approach to life and an unrelenting quest for continuous learning.<br />2. Dimostrazione - A committment to test knowledge through experience, persistence, and a willingness to learn from mistakes.<br />3. Sensazione - The continual refinement of the senses, especially sight, as the means to experience.<br />4. Sfumato - A willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty.<br />5. Arte/Scienza - The development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination. &quot;Whole-brain&quot; thinking.<br />6. Corporalita - The cultivation of grace, ambidexterity, fitness and poise.<br />7. Connessione - A recognition of and appreciation fro the interconnectedness of all things and phenomena. System thinking.<br />Familiar? Notwithstanding the brief introduction of da Vinci's life, abundant photos of his artpieces and sayings highlighted, this book is very similar to those in the sea of self help books with extensive use of mind maps and self assessment questions. For art lovers and with the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; storm, the Da Vinci label is for sure a plus. On the down side, I am afraid many self help book lovers and new quasi/psuedo Da Vinci fans may get disappointed by the remote and a little bit lukewarm Da Vinci substance the book carries, though the chapter &quot;The Beginner's Da Vinci Drawing Course&quot; is really unique.<br />So I give it a three star, that you can predetermine your love or hatred of it, which depends much on your experience with self help books and the temperature of your Da Vinci fever.<br />p.s.

A good reminder of easy tools to save time	Unlike most time management books going from chapter to chapter that lead readers to plan, set and prioritize their personal goals, treating time management problems essentially as life management problems, this book consists of 15 chapters of 96 short essays or tactics that you can easily apply to our daily lives. What a pity that Amazon does not post sample pages as it usually does which includes the Content pages so you can easily understand what kind of book this is, I take the pleasure to do it for you and hope it will help you grasp what the book tells.<br />Ch 1 Get a Handle on Your Time<br />The Myth of Free time<br />Give yourself a raise<br />Bill Yourself: A tactic that professionals use to become more efficient<br />Ch 2 Get Organized<br />Set your priorities<br />Write down your goals<br />Apply the 80/20 rule<br />Create a to do list that works and work your list<br />Ch 3 Increase your efficiency<br />Ch 4 Shortcuts<br />Ch 5 Find hidden time<br />Ch 6 Learn to focus<br />Ch 7 Pace Yourself<br />Ch 8 Avoid Procrastination<br />Ch 9 Avoid time wasting activities<br />Ch 10 Dont let others waste your time<br />Ch 11 Enlist others to save your time<br />Ch 12 Invest time to save time<br />Ch 13 Plan ahead<br />Ch 14 Use Technology that works<br />Ch 15 Balancing Work, family and social life<br />In short, this is a very useful and well written book (with abundant interesting and productive advice/examples of famous people and gurus) that one should buy and read at least twice a month as a cool reminder of one's own time management.

Though the title writes &quot;for sales and marketing&quot;, I am sure that it will be helpful for anyone who wants to strengthen his or her communication skills. In short, the author focuses on the concept of VAK [Visual (see/watch), Auditory (hear/sound) and Kinesthetic (feel/touch)], that we should pace and lead our target audience according to his/her own language preference. Of course, it's much more complicated than what the above describes, such as the usage of eye cues, embedding of action commands blah blah blah. Anyway, a must read!	2004-07-07

His three rules of the Tipping Point (threshold beyond which something will grow exponentially all of a sudden)- the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor and the Power of Context are really thought provoking. However, my interest to read on deteriorated real fast after the first 50 pages and I felt really hard to complete the 259 page book. (I admitted that I had jumped through many pages). The problem is that the author had lingered too long with the very few and not so popular examples to illustrate his Laws in separate contests. As some reviewers complained, he failed to use many lively examples which can explain his three laws once and for all.<br />In short, not an interesting book and definitely not something you will frequently refer to or re-read. Borrow it from your local library in case you really want to understand more about what Tipping Point is.	2004-06-25

For business and for fun	There are many business books and many self help books. Even the author had written many of the same kind himself. However, this one is truly outstanding and fascinating. The combination of war/battle histories with business/self development concepts bring life and glamour into the book. The ancedotes really help readers like me to better understand and bear in mind the twelve principles (in twelve chapters) the author elaborates. In short, a must buy for frequent business/self help book readers. I assure you that you can re-read it several times in the future with the same passionate interest.<br />p.s.

The first one is &quot;Victory! Applying the proven principles of military strategy to achieve greater success in your business and personal life&quot;. I love that coz it's clever use of real war stories did help me much to remember the lessons/principles Tracy wanna teach. Dont know whether that made me expect too much or what. Though this book also carries sound theories about how focusing or concentrating your mind and effort can improve myself in different arenas of life, I just forgot them real fast. I got to refer to it always, making use of the suggested steps or questions under various circumstances. You can say that's characteristic of a good &quot;how to&quot; book. I did expect more and better from the same brilliant speaker/author.<br />In short, a good book but there are better work from Tracy, like the one I mentioned above.<br />p.s. I like the following exercise in pg 128 very much.<br />Sit down with your loved ones and ask them these four questions.<br />1.

The rest are mostly individual chapters/stories/big deals elaborating what had been summarized in the first two chapters.<br />If this book is not so dated and highly focused on real estate deals, I would certainly give it a higher rating. Nevertheless, I enjoy reading it much.	2004-06-01

However, I had been very disappointed by this new one.<br />The authors are definitely gurus in trading and trading psychology. Nevertheless, their explanation of TA tools are extremely clumsy and disorganised, in particular the sections on Stochastics and MACD. That made me very frustrated because over half of the book was about TA from which I really could not get any significant benefit from reading it. Those regarding system trading, trading strategies etc are badly written as well. I just cannot recall and apply what I had read into my daily trading practice. There's not a holistic and organised picture about trading, and not to mention swing trading (a term you surprisingly scarce in a book with a title &quot;for swing trading&quot;) at all.<br />In a word, a sub-standard trading book not to be recommended.	2004-05-25

The same logic applies to those American readers who know that Bush had wronged seriously. For those Americans who still believe Bush is a good president who works for the goodness of your country and not for his families' and friends' financial benefits, dont waste your time and money.	2004-05-24

The first one pg 1-166 discusses 10 types of seductive characters, and the second one pg 167-429 goes through 24 steps of the seductive process, including:-<br /><br />1. Choose the right victim<br />2. Create a false sense of security - approach indirectly<br />3. Send mixed signals<br />4. Appear to be an object of desire - create triangles<br />5. Create a need - stir anxiety and discontent<br />6. Master the art of insinuation<br />7. Enter their spirit<br />8. Create temptation<br />9. Keep them in suspense - what comes next?<br />10. Use the demonic power of words to sow confusion<br />11. Pay attention to detail<br />12. Poetize your presence<br />13. Disarm through strategic weakness and vulnerability<br />14. Confuse desire and reality - the perfect illusion<br />15. Isolate the victim<br />16. Prove yourself<br />17. Effect a regression<br />18. Stir up the transgressive and taboo<br />19. Use spiritual lures<br />20. Mix Pleasure with pain<br />21. Give them space to fall - the pursuer is pursued<br />22. Use physical lures<br />23. Master the art of the bold move<br />24. Beware the aftereffects<br /><br />You may not agree with the effectiveness or morality of the moves above. However, as somebody physically and financially unattractive I assure you the ideas suggested really work. Without exaggeration, this is the best book I had ever read on this topic (You can check my other reviews to see how many book of the same type I had read before). Disregarding any moral concern, on top of the author's excellent writing and story telling skills (he did use a lot of historical stories to support his ideas), in case you want to read a book to seduce for result, this is it.

Leverage your emotions, dont exorcise them. (Understand how your idiosyncratic emotions undermine or enhance your investment decisions)<br />2. Dont just rely on the facts. (Understand also the deeper psychological forces that move Wall Street)<br />3. Know yourself. (Master an investing behavior in harmony with your own personality and lifestyle, your reaction to anxiety and pressure)<br />4. Understand the nuances of risk (Know how you feel when buying and selling)<br />5. Break the taboo (Understand your mistakes, and correct them)<br />6. Empathize with management<br />7. Recognise your investing anxieties<br />8. Be an interpersonal investor (expansion of perspective and protection against group think)<br />Very attractive, huh! So sorry that the author failed completely to write up to what he or his editors promised. Dont know whether the author's writing or story telling skill is so poor or what, the book appeared to be a boring pile of 291 dissociated pages that I find it very difficult to concentrate and read on. There are many real life cases and examples, but I can hardly draw from them any practical and memorable lessons.<br />In a word, dont waste your valuable time and hard earned money on this. Spend them elsewhere more productively.<br />p.s. How come the author gave no answer/suggestion/analysis for the 9 page &quot;investment personality questionnaire&quot; at the end of the book?? Should readers bring their answers to the author personally for advice???	2004-05-12

At least I become more aware of the uneasy gestures and &quot;freudian slip&quot; of those who wanna cheat me. I learnt tricks to test potential liars and to tap more information from people who wanna keep something in their mind from me. In particular I like the way the author put his theories into real life sample setting that readers like me can understand better how to apply different tactics under different circumstances. However, I have to say that there still exists significant ground for improvement. First, the priniciples are loosely linked in various chapters that one might have to read the book several times before one can really absorb the essence into his/her mind. Such a weakness is rarely found in books written by PhDs. Second, many more conditional applications can be added into the book. Third, there are just so many tactics for so diverse situations that one might easily forget them all. I am afraid I might have to read it over four times to bear at most 50% of the more useful tactics in my little mind.<br />In a word, a good read. Nevertheless, an enhanced version from the author is much anticipated.	2004-05-10

Though it is fluently written, it just resembles most of its competitors in any book store, except by an author coming from a big enterprise called &quot;Honeywell&quot; carrying an eye catching rare term named &quot;Execution&quot;.<br />Before I conclude my review, I would like to give you a brief summary of what this book is about.<br />To understand execution, readers have to keep three key points in their mind: 1) Execution is a discipline, and integral to strategy 2) Execution is the major job of the business leader 3)Execution must be a core element of an organisation's culture. The discipline of execution is based on a set of three building blocks that every leader must use to design, install and operate effectively the three core processes rigorously and consistently. The seven essential behavour of Building block I are: know your people and your business, insist on realism, set clear goals and priorities, follow through, reward the doers, expand people's capabilities and know yourself. Building block II is about creating the framework for cultural change whereas building block III is about having the right people in the right place. Meanwhile, the three core processes are those of making  links between people, strategy and operations.<br />Without prejudice, the above ideas are quite fundamental. However, I am not saying that this is a bad management book. After reading tens, if not over a hundred books of the same kind, I really cant agree that this book is exceptionally outstanding. Can be a leisure reading, but definitely not on the priority list.Can be a leisure reading, but definitely not on the priority list.	2004-05-10

The rest of the book is stuff that one can find in those better T.A. books, including divergence between stochastics vs price, trail day, Gann fan....<br />The problem with this book, besides the overly simple picture about swing trading which the author depicted, is that even the supposedly well selected graphic samples could not demonstrate how readers can apply and profit from what the author preached, as different people will have very different opinion on where to draw the action and reaction lines, making the tool practically useless.<br />In short, a waste of time and money. Dont buy this book. The five star ratings from readers anonymous and even a &quot;Crane&quot;, are purely promotional. Just read them and you may earn some laughs.	2004-04-10

The problem lies in &quot;how&quot; to incorporate this element into their daily business before they or their companies had been eaten by someone else. I am sorry that the author had not done a good job in this respect. He said a lot about the advantages of being speedy, but not practical methods of pushing it through bureaucracy, redtape, human resistance to change, the long term committment of top management......... Perhaps I had demanded too much from such a small book. However, I really believe the author is capable of giving us more, judged by his smooth and intelligent writing skills and choice of words.<br />Below please find some copy and paste for your reference.<br />Speed, merely for the sake of moving fast, without a destination inmind, is haste. Eventually, out of control, speed will land you in big trouble. But imagine how many  more races you would win if you had a big head start. Think about the advantage  you would have if you knew what the future was going to look like and were able to spot trends before the competition. Consider the power of being able to think about things quickly and accurately, tackling in minutes the same big issues and questions the competition would be processing for weeks. pg 9<br />Question everything...all the time. If you want to hone your anticipatory skills, accept nothing. Question everything. Ask how and why of everything that's presented to you. pg 19<br />A fund manager's best year will likely be his or her first.

However, perhaps Chesterton is not the Oscar Wilde, Bernard Shaw or even Winston Churchill type of person who frequently spoke intelligent words with a little scent of sarcasm, he is never a good choice for compiling a book of wise sayings. I am sorry to say that is by far the most boring book of its kind I had ever read. For those who want to know more about Chesterton and learn his wisdom in the right context, his autobiography is certainly a much better choice.<br />p.s.  I never expected that the book could be this very thin and small, and thus expensive, relatively speaking. (and even more expensive considering the quality of content)	2004-03-03
US	46348524	R1MC9BZRBFJWH5	0688128165	978667155	Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Excellent! Highly recommended.	This book is primarily about how marketers and sales professional manipulate our minds for their benefits. The topics covered are extensive, including contrast principle, mimic tricks of photuris/blenny, rule for reciprocation, reciprocal concessions (rejection then retreat technique), consistency (willingness to believe in the correctness of a difficult choice, once made), foot in the door technique, committing power of public/written statements, manipulation and exploitation of customers' self image, principle of social proof (draw of the crowd vs pluralistic ignorance when people feel most uncertain and unfamiliar), effect of repeated contact on liking (condition dependent), application of common goals for conflict solving, good cop/bad cop ploy, conditioning and association, the strength of authority pressure, scarcity principle (limited freedom to something makes it more desirable),  Romeo and Juliet effect, etc etc. What makes it so outstanding from it's kind is that 1) it's so well written with many vivid examples and few jargons that most readers with no or little psychology background can enjoy it much. 2)In the end of each chapter there's a section named &quot;how to say no&quot;, something you seldom find in other psychology book. That's certainly a plus coz knowledge without application amounts to nothing.<br />In a word, a page turner and a must read particulary for everything in the city jungle.<br />Remarks: I like the opening adages of some chapters much. To quote some:<br />Chapter 3 Committment and Consistency: It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end. Da Vinci<br /><br />Chapter 4 Influence: Where all think alike, no one thinks very much. Lippmann<br /><br />Chapter 5 Liking: The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client.

But they exist in the future and the past, beyond the pale of the sensory realm. Practice, the path of mastery, exists only in the present. You can see it, hear it, smell it, feel it. To love the plateau is to love the eternal now, to enjoy the inevitable spurts of progress and the fruits of accomplishment, then serenely to accept the new plateau that waits just beyond them. To love the plateau is to love what is most esssential and enduring in your life.\\" In other words, this book centers around patience, resilence, continuous learning and a little bit of zen, though the former three terms were not present inside the book at all.<br />Many reviewers gave five stars to this book and some even said that this is the unique self help book one might need. However, I really cant agree so because this book is so targeted to specific segments which the author described as the dabblers (the eternal kids) and the obsessive (the bottom line type), where the lack of patience or persistence appears to be their primal problem. Certainly there are other types of issues that deter \\"self helpers\\". Meanwhile, I must say that the passage devoted to homeostasis (internal resistance to change) is brilliant. In short, this book is worth a read.<br />p.s. I would like to quote two passages which I like the most for your reference.<br />1. In his book Zen Mind....Suzuki approaches the question of fast and slow learners in terms of horses. \\"In our scriptures, it is said that there are four kinds of horses:...The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the driver's will, before it sess the shadow of the whip; the second best...just before the whip reaches its skin; the third ....when it feels pain on its body; the fourth...after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones....When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse....But this is a mistake, Master Suzuki says.

How could I miss this one which Tom Wolfe described on the inside back cover as Lewis' grandest tour de force yet? However, being a Chinese trader who's ignorant about baseball, I could only complete the first two chapters (42 pages out of 288) and put it down. The large amount of baseball jargon and player name just stopped me from reading onwards. In fact, this review is written with the sole purpose to warn fellow Lewis' fans that this book, unlike his previous ones, require readers of certain knowledge and interest of baseball. If you're not a baseball fan, I strongly suggest you to give this book a pass.	2004-02-27

In short, this is a book about very long term market timing through 100+ years of &quot;statistical or historical analysis&quot; plus some &quot;trading philosophy&quot;. The essence of it came in the first 39 pages (or 3 chapters out of 13), which can be summarized as:-<br />1. Optimal buy points come in years ending in twos and threes, followed by the incredibly strong five years, then in the fall of any year ending in seven. Most major highs have come in years ending in nine and zero. pg 14<br />2. Every four years we expect a market bottom. Incidentally one should be looking for significant market bottoms in 2006, 2010, 2014.... pg 19/20<br />3. March buys in years ending in eights and September exits in years ending in nines gave spectacular results. pg 25<br />4. The Oct buy April sell % gain is significantly higher than the April buy Oct sell % gain. pg 33<br />5. Combining all the above, we should have a significant market rally in 2005 and another in 2006. pg 38<br />Up to this very day on Feb 2004 which is over nine months after it's publication, what the author said was by and large correct. There is no reason not to recommend this book to anybody who got the patience and the courage to place a high probability bet.<br />p.s. With respect to the trading philosophy part, I would like to quote something from the book for your reference. Hope you like them.<br />1. October.

However, I still failed to realize that the title of the book simply meant the Old Testament, and that I was very ignorant of the Old Testament.<br />Back to the book itself. The author had expressed that he would like modern christians to re-balance their interest between the Old and the New Testaments, when most of us had certainly put our time on the later one, if we had read it at all. Afterall, Jesus did read and always quote from it. In this respect, I doubt whether his objective can be served because I really think those who had read the Old Testament twice could appreciate the insights that the author had observed and the majority had neglected. The fact that the author had focused only on Job, Deuteronomy, Psalm, Ecclesiastes and the books of the prophets as a whole made it an ordinary Bible commentary instead of the other Yancey works with clear central themes. Nevertheless, this book is still up to the average but still outstanding Yancey standard, perhaps except the part on Deuteronomy, which some other reviewrs shared the same not so positive opinion with me. Anyway, I would strongly recommend this book to all Christians, preferably if one had read the relevant books in the Old Testament at least once.<br />As usual in all my reviews, I would like to copy and paste some messages for your reference. Hope they would help you to better understand the goodness of the book.<br />\\"\\"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\\" We usually interpret that commandment in a narrow sense of prohibiting swearing,\\" said Webber, who then proceed to expand its meaning to never live as though God does not exist. Or, stated positively, Always live in awareness of God's existence. ...Any key to living in such awareness must be found in the Old Testament. pg 29<br />The Old Testament gives clues into the kind of history God is writing. Exodus identifies by name the two Hebrew midwives who helped save Moses'life, but it does not bother to record the name of the Pharaoh rulng Egypt. First Kings grants a total of eight verses to King Omri, even though secular historians regard him as one of Israel's most powerful kings. In his own history, God does not seem impressed by size or power or wealth. Fiath is what he wants, and the heroes who emerge are heros of faith, not strength or wealth. pg 32<br />At root, Job faced a crisis of faith, not of suffering. ...At such times we focus too easily on circumstances - illness, our looks, poverty, bad luck as the enemy. We pray for God to change those circumstances.....When tragedy strikes, we too will be trapped in a limited point of view. Like Job, we will be tempted to blame God and see him as the enemy.... I hesitate to write this because it is a hard truth, one I do not want to acknowledge: Job convinces me that God cares more about our faith than our pleasure.....In a message to Ezekiel God includes Job in a list of three giants of righteousness. The other two mentioned, Noah and Daniel, learned faith in the midst of a massive flood and a den of lions. pg 63/64<br />God did not condemn Job's doubt and despair, only his ignorance. pg 70<br />Bear it up; keep smiling; suffering makes you strong, say some spirtual advisors - but not the psalmists. They do not rationalize anger away or give abstract advice about pain; rather, they express emotions vividly and loudly, directing their feelings primarily at God. pg 122<br />Many psalms convey this spirit of \\"Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,\\" a way of talking oneself into faith when emotions are wavering....For the Hebrew poets, God represented a reality more solid than their own whipsaw emotions or the checkered history of their people. They wrestled with God over every facet of their lives, and in the end it was the very act of wrestling that proved their faith. pg 123<br />The only wisdom we can hope to acquire is the wisdom of humility. Humility is endless. T.S. Eliot pg 154<br />Ecclesiastes insists that the stones we trip over are good things in themselves: \\"He has made everything beautiful in its time.\\" Yet by assuming a burden we were not mean to carry, we turn nudity into pornography, wine into alcoholism, food into gluttony, and human diversity into racism and prejudice. Despair descends as we abuse God's good gifts; they seem no longer gifts, and no longer good. pg 159<br />Unless we acknowledge our limits and subject ourselves to God's rule, unless we trust the Giver of all good gifts, we will end up in a state of despair. Ecclesiastes calls us to accept our status as creatures under the dominion of the Creator, something few of us do without a struggle. pg 160<br />Why read the prophets? There is one compelling reason: to get to know God. The prophets are the Bible's most forceful revelation of God's personality. pg 180wisdom we can hope to acquire is the wisdom of humility.

Unlike his other works with clearer central themes, this book is a collection of essays loosely bound by the notion that God exists nearly anywhere, anytime in the world history and our personal ones, from prisons, collapse of the communist regimes in Eastern Europe, non violence protests of Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., to the love of the anonymous who help other humans blah blah blah.<br />To those christians and even non christians who had not read any other Yancey book, this can be a comfortable start to know one of the most important christian writer of our time. However, for somebody like me who had tasted his heavenly fruit and become one of his fans, this book would seem a little bit repetitive of his more famous works like &quot;What's so amazing about grace&quot; and &quot;Where is God when it hurts&quot;, and thus unable to satisfy one's enhanced spiritual appetite.	2004-02-25

Books	5	12	14	N	N	With us, proved by the death of Christ, through our deeds	If I were not in one of the two most painful moment of my thirty seven year life, I certainly would have avoided this book though it's written by Philip Yancey, my favorite Christian author. I am still in great pain, but I must say that this book does help.<br />Even God Himself did not explain to Job why Job had suffered, so the author just focused his discussion on the &quot;meaning&quot; or &quot;to what end&quot; of suffering. He had covered many topics, like the clear distinction between pain and suffering, the biological necessity of pain, how well intended consolation or even gift cards of christians can do more harm than good, the importance of hope as a pain killer, the notion of &quot;the wounded healer&quot; first preached by Nouven that God enables christians to help others in future through their suffering, the death of Christ as evidence that God knows our suffering and cares, etc etc.<br />No matter what, as somebody who's suffering and strongly believe that my current experience will endow me with stronger capability to help others in the future, I can tell this is a very good book that helps. If I have only one complaint, it is that most of the examples quoted by the author were about disease and death. It would be better if he could talk more about those who suffer under divorce.........<br />p.s. As in all my recent reviews, below please find some copy and paste from the book for your reference.<br />-- If I spend my life searching for happiness through drugs, comfort and luxury, it will elude me. Happiness recedes from those who pursue her. Happiness will come upon me unexpectedly as a by product, a surprising bonus for something I have invested myself in. And, most likely, that investment will include pain. It is hard to imagine pleasure without it.<br />-- Until you know a little more about running the physical universe, Job, dont tell me how to run the moral universe.<br />-- Guilt is a pain message to the conscience, informing it that something is wrong and should be dealth with.<br />-- Paul had learned the lesson of the Beatitudes: poverty, affliction, sorrow, and weakness can actually be means of grace if we turn to God with a humble, dependent spirit. For when I am weak, then I am strong. Paul concluded. The weaker we feel, the harder we may lean.<br />-- At the instant of pain, it may seem impossible to imagine that good can come from tragedy. (It must have seemed so to Christ at Gethsemane. ) We never know in advance exactly how suffering can be transformed into a cause for celebration. But that is what we are asked to believe. Faith means believing in advance what will only make sense in reverse.<br />-- I have mentioned that no one offers the name of a philosopher when I asked the question, &quot;Who helped you most?&quot; Most often they answer by describing a quiet, unassuming person. Someone who was there whenever needed, who listened more than talked, who didnt keep glancing down at a watch, who hugged and touched, and cried, someone who was available, and came on the sufferer's terms not their own.ething is wrong and should be dealth with.<br />-- Paul had learned the lesson of the Beatitudes: poverty, affliction, sorrow, and weakness can actually be means of grace if we turn to God with a humble, dependent spirit.

The author discussed quite many ideas so as to lead readers to the key theme of the book which can be summarized by the following sentence in pg 201, &quot;Without seasons of prayerful waiting for fresh power (the fueling/filling of the Holy Spirit, if I got it right), we will see little or no divine assistance in doing God's work.&quot;<br />The author did elaborate with many scriptures, real life examples, strong and straight messages against the negligence and misunderstanding of some churches on Holy Spirit, love, prayer etc. However, the chapters just seem so dissociated that made me feel that I was just reading past records of weekly sermon. I am sorry that I still cant answer some questions like: Should I pray for it or should I pray to it? How can I know that I am filled or fueled by it? I know that there are many things about God that cant be fully understood until we were raised to heaven. But as the author stressed so much on it, I think he should give me a better answer. I really believe he could.<br />No matter what, bright and meaningful messages are plenty. So sorry that the book does not shine as a whole.  I would like to quote some below for your reference:-<br />For the New Testament without the coming of the Holy Spirit in power over self, sin and the devil is no better a help to heaven than the Old Testament without the coming of the Messiah. pg 25<br />What God calls us to do, he will also be faithful to equip us to do. pg 80<br />The acid test for a real Christian experience is our love for one another. pg 95<br />Most people plot and plan themselves into mediocrity, while now and again somebody forgets himself into greatness. pg 141<br />If the Master whom we follow was crucified, on what basis do we think we will escape all trouble? pg 177<br />Any voice that says, Clean up your act first and then come to Christ, has to be from Satan. pg 199<br />Lord, I am weak.

One can certainly learn more about Jesus	As promised by the book title, the author tried to deliver something \\"insightful\\" about Jesus to anybody, including those who might had already read the whole New Testament several times. IMHO, he did a superb job, no matter whether or not one agrees with his relatively liberal perspective manifest in his later and more well known book \\"What's so amazing about grace?\\". Though I think \\"What's\\" is even better, I do recommend this to any christian who wants to know more about Christ our Savior.<br /><br />Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference:-<br />The temptation in the desert reveals a profound difference between God's power and Satan's power. Satan has the power to coerce, to dazzle, to force obedience, to destroy....God's power, in contrast, is internal and noncoercive....As every parent and every lover knows, love can be rendered powerless if the beloved chooses to spurn it. pg76<br />Jesus did not mechanically follow a list of \\"Things I gotta do today,\\", and I doubt he would have appreciated our modern emphasis on punctuality and precise scheduling. He attended wedding feasts that lasted for days.

The recommendation or the content is very straightforward. As concluded by the author, they include 1) buy stocks that are receiving upward earnings estimate revisions and sell stocks that are receiving downward earnings estimate revisions owing to &quot;analyst creep&quot; and delayed price response. 2) buy companies that are reporting earnings better than expectations and avoid companies that are reporting earnings worse than expectations owing to post earnings announcement drift and &quot;cockroach effect&quot;. 3) subscribe the Zacks Rank, which somebody did the homework of the above for you with a fee 4) focus on changes in analysts' recommendations over time. The catch is: I doubt only a very small percentage of home investors have the time or resources to execute any one of the recommendations above for long and as a result they can only go to Zacks Investment Research for help, and thus bringing the whole book to something not far from a sales talk.<br />In short, if you are already aware of the innate problem with any analysts' recommendation and you are not going to subscribe to any fee based research, this book is not for you. However, if you are a green hand in the investment game, prepared to shop for a research report and pick the stocks yourself, this book may still worth a read.	2004-02-14

A great book of even greater souls	In short, this is a brief introduction of thirteen great souls who influenced Philip Yancey, one of the best Christian writers of our time. They include Martin Luther King, G.K. Chesterton, Dr. Paul Brand, Dr. Robert Coles, Leo Tolstoy, Feodor Dostoevsky, Gandhi, Dr. Everett Koop, John Donne, Annie Dillard, Frederick Buechner, Shusaku Endo and Henri Nouwen. No matter whether you know their names/works or not, your interest to know them more will be much increased after you read this book like I do. In fact, I had already ordered some books by Chesterton and Tolstoy immediately after I finished reading those chapters about them.<br />I believe that only very few readers who have not read Yancey's other books will have interest in this book. And if you are already a fan of Yancey,  this one definitely wont disappoint you but will bring your perspective to a new horizon.	2004-02-09

It really helps!<br />The author had covered most of the topics that should be included in a compleat guide of trading (trading psychology, uaage of TA, money management, trading system development....). Some of his key points are:-<br />1. Top traders are essentially pro gamblers who only bet when the odds are in their favor.<br />2. Trading must be dealt focusedly as an entrepreneurial business with loss (must be relatively smaller than profit) taken emotionlessly as regular business cost.<br />3. Good money management is the common denominator of all successful traders irrespective of their style.<br />4. TA is bascially a trend/fact finding process to be searched through multiple time frames, verified with different indicators, and that TA can be applied on indicators as well (trendline in MACD, and CD between price and MACD)<br />I personally like the no nonsense and humorous writing of the author much. The summary and point form \\"do's and dont's\\" in the end of every chapter did help me to memorise what I had studied for long. His clever use of graphs in the TA tools section is really outstanding. Believe me or not, his use of less than 10 pages on the explanation of MACD is a lot more powerful than many TA books that used up over 100 pages on this single topic.<br />In short, it's a must read for any player who wants to improve his/her edge over the ocean of competitors in the market. My salute to the author who writes me this excellent book.	2004-01-17

No FA, no TA, but ten chapters or the author's so called principles on trading psychology, which are<br />1. The market is always right.<br />2. It's all in your head.<br />3. You cant prepare enough.<br />4. Supply and demand rule the markets<br />5. Commit your thoughts to paper<br />6. Developing and perfecting your trading shtick<br />7. Enhancing your shtick<br />8. Discipline<br />9. Staying the course<br />10. On becoming the ideal trader<br />Though the above can be commonly found in most trading books, the author had done it relatively well by drawing many  uncommon analogies, stories, idiomatic phrases that put life into the book. In particular I like his description of successful traders as captains in the oceans, mice in the laboratories and actuaries in insurance companies.<br />In short, if you wanna read a good trading psychology book, this is it. If you want TA or FA knowledge, look somewhere else.<br />p.s. The seven cardinal sins of trading in the last chaper is a favorite of mine. They are:-<br />1. Pride, which challenges the first rule of trading: The market is always right.<br />2. Greed, holding onto trades hoping for more and more profits while all TA signals are telling you the party is over.<br />3. Envy, drains positive energy from their psyche, leaving them mean spirited and weak.<br />4. Anger, that when Greek gods decided to destroy a human, they got him angry and let him destroy himself.<br />5. Lust, equates to ignoring key defensive rules or self control. The unbridled gambler is the epitome of lust, doubling up after every loss.<br />6. Gluttony, a lack of focus. Trading becomes obsession They eat and sleep trading.<br />7. Sloth, that a lazy successful trader is an oxymoron. He or she just doesnt exist.	2004-01-01

Books	5	31	34	N	N	The best Christian book I ever read	I was attracted to this book by the long list of recommendation on the back cover and the stamp that said it's the 1996 book of the year by a publisher association. As a Chinese born and living in Hong Kong, I took them as sheer American style marketing gimmick. The fact is, I had been 100% wrong.<br /><br />I had read tens if not over a hundred Christian books and this is by far the best I ever picked. It had corrected many of my misunderstandings or ignorance about Jesus, His Grace and His teachings. Say, I can disagree with homosexuality, adultery, communism but I still have to love patients, victims and sinners as Jesus did. Non violent protest can still mean a lot as what Martin Luther King did. Legalism and perfectionism can do more harm than good in evangelistic sense coz humans tend to break rules innately, and rule-breaking will haunt somebody from church and God, and that of one hundred men one read the Bible and the ninty nine read Christians etc etc.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticized that the author had tried to preach  his own secular view instead of Jesus's teachings, to replace God's high grace with low human love and care, to win the approval of men at the expense of God's holiness blah blah blah. I assure you that all of these criticisms were wrong, and I sincerely hope that you can read the book through and judge yourself. You wont be disappointed and you may even be moved into tears on some chapters.<br /><br />Below please find some copy and paste for your reference. Hope you like them.<br />Nowadays legalism has changed its focus. In a thoroughly secular culture, the church is more likely to show ungrace through a spirit of moral superiority or a fierce attitude toward opponents in the culture wars. The church also communicates ungrace through its lack of unity. Mark Twain used to say he put a dog and a cat in a cage together ...a bird, pig and goat. They, too, got along fine after a few adjustments. Then he put in a Baptist, Presbyterian, and Catholics; soon there was not a living thing left. Pg 33<br />In one of his last acts before death, Jesus forgave a thief dangling on a cross, knowing full well the theif had converted out of plain fear. That theif would never study the Bibile, never attend synagogue or church, and never make amends to all those he had wronged. He simply said \\"Jesus, remember me,\\" and Jesus promised, \\"Today you will be with me in paradise.\\" It was another reminder that grace does not depend on what we have done for God but rather what God has done for us. Pg 54<br />Paul, the chief of sinners, he once called himself - knew beyond doubt that God loves people because who God is, not because of who we are. Pg67<br />Jesus declared that we should have one distinguishing mark: not political correctness or moral superiority, but love. Paul added that without love nothing will do - no miracle of faith, no theological brilliance, no flaming personal sacrifice - will avail.not a living thing left.

I like its variety of content (that the author introduced a lot sentiment indicators like CBOE Put/Call Parity + Volatility Index, RYDEX Mutual Fund Flows, Volume indicators for QQQ and S&amp;P 500 Depository Receipts), plus the author's writing style and integrity (the author did quoted frequently from other writers). Some technical tools like MACD, ADX were discussed, but only briefly.

Behavior is patterned.<br />2. Your trading patterns reflect your emotion patterns.<br />3. Change begins with self observation<br />4. Problem patterns tend to be anchored to particular states. (When you enter a particular state thru emotional, physical, or cognitive activity, you tend to activate the behavioral patterns associated with that state.)<br />5. Our normal states of mind, which define most of our daily experience, lie within a restricted range of our possibilities. (Your immersion in daily routine keeps you locked in routine mind states)<br />6. Most trading occurs in a limited range of states, trapping traders in problem patterns. (Traders tend to place greater emphasis on the data they process than on the ways in which they process those data.)<br />7. People in general, and traders specifically, enact solutions as well as problem patterns.<br />8. Eliminating emotions is not necessarily the secret to improving trading. (Traders can utilize positive emotional experiences to identify constructive solution patterns and to create an anchoring of new, positive patterns.)<br />9. Success in the markets often comes from doing what doesnt come naturally.<br />10. The intensity and the repetition of change efforts are directly responsible for their utlimate success.<br />11. Trading success is a function of possessing a statistical edge in the markets and being able to exploit this edge with regularity.<br /><br />In short, if you can appreciate or at least have a slight idea of what the above 11 themes try to preach, this book suits you well. Otherwise, please give it a pass.this edge with regularity.     In short, if you can appreciate or at least have a slight idea of what the above 11 themes try to preach, this book suits you well.

Outstanding from many books in the market of empty slogans, hallow jargons and weak propositions, the author discussed in simple but intelligent words, (and always in Q&amp;A, key point formats that help readers to grasp and remember), how to perform outstandingly in the workplace by adopting an integrated approach through personal improvement in time, stress, health and relationship management. Well backed by his M.D. expertise, he explained well in our daily language the important connection between our physical and mental conditions, and had smoothly put forward means of positively influencing our mental conditions through physiological activities, like actively controlling what you eat and how you sit and sleep.<br />In short, this is a highly valuable book that any person that strives for better career and life performance shouldnt miss.	2003-11-25

What, and simply all, he said are still true today. He's a genius and really deserves a Nobel prize. To me, he already is. I think it is more appropriate to quote the praise of a Nobel Laureatet from the back cover of &quot;The Accidential Theorist..&quot; than to write one myself because it's completely applicable and I just could not think of anything better to praise his new book.<br />&quot;When it comes to popularized economic wisdom, there are a lot of balloons of ignorance out there, many of them reinforced by self interest and self confidence.

The book cover with a hand holding two dices really matched many traders' perception of the market as a casino which long term success depends much on uncertainty, probability, money management....I had been quite disappointed because I really didnt get much useful information from this book that could help my bottom line. Seemingly the author had been so keen to put plenty of theories in mathematics, psychology and even his own trading experience in the book that most readers' primary purpose had not been met nor satisfied. It's just too jumpy and out of focus. Much had been covered, but it's just so hard to absorb and learn when the coverage is always shallow and light. Though some reviewers gave high praise to the author's use of language, I could hardly appreciate so. In fact, I really doubt how many readers of not so strong mathematics, psychology, or investment background could really understand the book. I am sorry to say that being a professional trader and a CFA charterholder, I couldnt.<br />For those who want to read something about the relationship between mathematics and trading/investment, &quot;Fooled by Randomness&quot; by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a much better choice.	2003-11-20

Both of them are outrageous. It's certainly great fun to read insider stories, which are interesting but fifthy, of how the supposedly honorable banks screwed their customers. Naturally I had very high expectation of this book before I started reading it. To my minor surprise, the author had adopted a completely different style writing this book, making it a very serious and exhaustive account of how big banks like Bankers' Trust, CSFB, LTCM, Morgan Stanley and gigantic conglomerates like Enron, Worldcom, Orange County made use of dubiously legal practice for their own profits or demise, but certainly at the expense of shareholders. This material is really qualified to be a testimony before the Congress, which the author really did.<br />I do appreciate the author's sincerity of warning the public about the legal and moral problems of the real financial world with the advance in technology and financial techniques. A reviewer here said that the author was living in an ivory tower. I feel so sorry for that critic and those who thought so. As a professional trader, I assure you that the real world is indeed more dangerous and fifthy. Anyway, I do recommend this book as an indispensable material for anyone, especially govt officials (though I doubt very much they will humbly read and take this book seriously) who want to look into this. For those who just want to read for fun, FIASCO might be a better choice.	2003-11-11

It's well written and is an easy read.<br />Meanwhile, many reviewers complain against it as too positive thinking, pagan/materialistic. out of context....In fact, the author did stress on the importance of praying, with relatively extensive coverage in this tiny book, for letting God do great, ministerial and god glorifying things through, and not by, us, (Hope you understand the difference), and that we should have high senstivity to know, and to act on what God wants us to do in so given divine opportunities.<br />However, I cant fully agree to the author's perspective because there seems to be some fundamental disagreement between his interpretation of Jabez's prayer and that of the Lord's prayer.

A must for all who study the man and the language	The title of my review had simply told what I wanna say. Churchill is such a famous person of wit and words. That's beyond argument. Therefore it's not a difficult job for the editor-author to pick and pack Churchill's words, with some short sentences telling the background of each, into a thin book. Anyway, he did it alright.<br />I would like to pick some of my favorite quotes for your reference. Hope you like them and can share my feelings of how brilliant Churchill. and also indirectly, this book is.<br />1. &quot;Trying to maintain good relations with a Communist is like wooing a crocodile. You do not know whether to tickle it under the chin or beat it over the head. When it opens its mouth, you cannot tell whether it is trying to smile or preparing to eat you up.&quot;<br />2. &quot;No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeeed, it has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&quot;<br />3. &quot;You will never get to the end of the journey if you stop to buy a stone at every dog that barks.&quot;<br />4. &quot;Virtuous motives, trammelled by inertia and timidity, are no match for armed and resolute wickedness.&quot;<br />5. &quot;What if I had said, instead of &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot;, &quot;Hostilities will be engaged with our adversary on the coastal perimeter?&quot;.<br />and......many other invaluable quotes.

Those were the sessions with relatively higher appeal and practical value. The rest of the book covered, in individual chapters, specifics of ten different sports (mountain biking, skiing, marathon, golf, volleyball.....), elaborated with quotes and short stories from top performers and their coaches.<br />For serious players, these sessions were too concise. Actually, I am an above average player in tennis, cycling and swimming. (These three were covered individually in the book). However, I dont find the chapters devoted to each of them really helpful to lift my performance up.<br />To those amateurs who know very little about mental training, this is an acceptably good start. For serious players, they should have known a lot more here and there from sports magazines, newspaper columns and even websites. Furthermore, I think that the book could be much enhanced if the author could shift the weight back more on general topics (he definitely has more material to write for more than 69 pages) instead of talking specifically but so little on individual sports.<br />To conclude, this book can be helpful, but only marginally and conditionally.	2003-10-20

Though it focused primarily on commodities, the principles are applicable to stock trading as well. Traders can definitely benefit from them.<br />For those who had read other Gann's books before, you may feel that this one is quite similar to his previous books (this is Gann's last book published). In fact, the rules set here are over 95% identical with those laid out in &quot;45 Years in Wall Street&quot; Gann published two years before this. However, as one reviewer wrote that the above average price ($49) of this highly valuable book is still lower than one single pip of a commodity futures contract, I think it should still be an essential item in any Gann friend's personal collection.	2003-10-13

Some reviewers argue that it's the good business environment of the 90's that allowed Rudy to perform the job well. I assure you that's absolutely false. Take the example of South East Asia whereas all countries including PRC enjoyed tremendous economic growth after the 97 financial crisis, Hong Kong had been getting worse year after year under an exceptionally bad government.<br />Back to the content of the book. Rudy had talked much about crisis management (and very little about his personal life except his cancer, but still job related), or actually, relentless anticipation and preparation, readiness to make timely decision and take responsibility, under promise and over deliver, staking with the right group of staff and communicating with them well, etc etc. One can always read them in management textbooks. What makes such a difference is that Rudy's ideas are well supported with real stories and that gives life and credibility to what he wants to preach.<br />In a word, a very good book and I wanna give Giuliani my salute.	2003-10-06

To me, this is more a personal management book which I learnt some new ideas and revisited some present ones, all in a highly comprehensible, interesting and easy reading manner. Some points for your reference are:-<br />1) The heart is not just an organ for pumping blood, but with the second largest amount of neuron (the same type of cell for the functioning in our brain). We do have a lot of it in our digestion system as well, a possible explanation to our heart and gut feelings.<br />2) Stress affects our production of hormones and drains our energy. Extended period of stress leads to maladaptation and thus premature aging and health problems. I like the author's refering to the fish in the highly contaminated Hudson River.<br />3) The analogy of the natural frequency in nature (ref the resonance for string instructment) to the need for dynamic balance inside a human and thus an organisation for optimal performance.<br />In short, though I dont believe the approach prescribed by this book can help much to improve the culture of many big corps, I do regard this as a very good book and I do recommend this to any business person who still has the heart for improvement.	2003-09-24

All reviewers before me rated this book with less than 3 stars. This book really belongs to the rare breed.<br />Though he author used a lot of charts, supported with Stochastics (he used that badly, too), to elaborate how to use Gann's ideas to trade for profit, he failed miserably. His charts and his analysis were simply beyond apprehension, even for a pro like me. You couldnt understand what &quot;pattern&quot; (that's what charts are for) the author was talking about. He should have employed some professionals to edit his original script. The addition of copy and paste ideas from the original Gann books just couldnt help at all. Dont waste your hard earned money on this mess.<br />p.s. I am sorry that the only points the author made it clear were:<br />1)The basic ratio of Gann Angles is 1:1 - one unit of price equalling one unit of time. A 2x1 Gann Angle indicates that prices are moving two units of price in one unit of time. (Perhaps the only clear thing on this book)<br />2)After an initial, sustained price move, either up or down, prices retrace ot 50% of their initial move. If the retracement exceeds 50%, prices should continue to the 62.5% (5/8) level, before a reaction occurs. (Gann used 1/8 as the base unit of his forecast) (Perhaps the only simplifed and clear thing on this book)	2003-09-21

I did have great expectation on this book. I had been quite disappointed. Instead of elaborating on the similarities for playing pro sports and trading, it's more like a business management book emphasizing on setting achievable, strategic, measurable, controllable, flexible and positive goals of daily, weekly, monthly and yearly time span. I am not kidding. The authors did put tables of the above goals for you to fill in te blank. Though the authors also had chapters on motivation, concentration, pressure handling, routine setting, loss handling stuff but the coverage of them, in my opinion as a veteran trader and frequent trading book lover, were far from sufficient and sophisticated to help traders to turn themselves into a pro athlete and win this highly competitive game. The analogy is brilliant, but is only limited to the title. The content is not. It's just like reading one of those common psychology or life management books.	2003-09-07

I had no idea of who's James Cramer before reading the book \\"Trading with the Enemy: Seduction and Betrayal on Jim Cramer's Wall Street\\" by Nicholas W. Maier, who described Cramer as nothing but a sucker, a monster, a maniac and a workaholic torturing and throwing whatever handy at his staff during a losing trade. Cramer really is, as he confessed in his own book about simply everything in his life, his quasi insider trading type of fund management style that gave him 14 consecutive years of positive return, his fund's proximity to drowning with LTCM in 1998 saved only by luck and his wife Karen who he respected as the trading goddess, his conflict and later reconciliation with his friend Marty the publisher of Republic, his involvement in Street.com, his retirement to become a full time writer and TV host blah blah blah.<br />I never expected the book could be that interesting, a real pager turner. He's really a good writer. No matter whether you like Cramer the person or not, you shouldnt miss this.<br />p.s. As a trader, I do envy Cramer for his luck in trading and getting such a beautiful, understanding and intelligent wife.

By all means what put forth by Gann as the 12 and the 24 rules are still valid today. In fact, his ideas are still being copied in simply all other trading books. Even the diary like section in Soros' Alchemy of Fianance did resembled the style of a majority part of this book. In short, a must read for any trader!<br />Remark: One might think that I am a crazy Gann friend. To justifiy the title I put for this review, I would like to summarize Gann's 12 and 24 rules for one's reference:-<br />The 12 rules:-<br />1. Determine the trend<br />2. Buy at single, double and triple bottoms<br />3. Buy and sell on percentages<br />4. Buy and sell on 3 weeks' advance or decline<br />5. Market moves in sections/waves<br />6. Buy or sell on 5 to 7 point moves<br />7. Study volume to determine change in trend<br />8. Study time factor and time periods to determine change in trend. (p.s. when a time period on a decline exceeds that of a previous decline, it indicates a change in trend)<br />9. Buy on higher tops and bottoms<br />10. A change in trend often occurs just before or after holidays. (p.s. when prices are at high levels there are usually several swings up and down, then when the market breaks the low of the last swing it indicates a reversal and change in trend)<br />11. Buy on a second reaction at a higher bottom. When it reacts only 2 days, it is in a very strong position.<br />12. Price gains in fast moves does not last very long.<br />The 24 rules:-<br />1. Never risk one tenth of capital in one trade.<br />2. Always use stop loss orders.<br />3. Never overtrade.<br />4. Never let a profit run into a loss.<br />5. Do not buck the trend.<br />6. When in doubt, get our or dont get in.<br />7. Trade only active stocks.<br />8. Equal distribution of risk in 4 or 5 stocks.<br />9. Trade market order.<br />10. Dont clsoe your trades without a good reason.<br />11. Accumulate a surplus<br />12. Never buy just to get a dividend.<br />13. Never average a loss.<br />14. Never get out/in of the market because of impatience or anxiety.<br />15. Avoid taking small profits and big losses.<br />16. Never cancel a stop loss order after you placed it.<br />17. Avoid getting in and out of the market too often.<br />18. Be just as willing to seel short as you are to buy. Let your object be to keep with the trend and make money.<br />19. Never buy/sell just because the price is low/high.<br />20. Wait till the stock is very active and has crossed resistance levels before pyramiding.<br />21. Select stocks with small volume of shares outstanding to pyramid on the buying side.<br />22. Never hedge one stock by another.<br />23. Trade with a plan and do not get out without a definite indication of a change in trend.<br />24. Avoid increasing trading size after a long period of success.arket because of impatience or anxiety.<BR>15. Avoid taking small profits and big losses.<BR>16.

Though the authors emphasized that the purpose of the book was to pursue what Munger of Bershire Hathaway preached about the &quot;lattice of models&quot; approach to investing that successful investors should read as much as he could on as many diverse subjects as possible, and that development in Quantum physics would bring 2/3 of the existing 30 DJI stocks out of their places in the index in less than 2 decades. this book was far too repetitive and clumsy in elaborating the same idea of the importance of Quantum Physics. The amateur knowledge and so so writing skill of the authors would drive nearly half of the readers to confusion because they would still have close to nothing clue about Quantum Physics, whilst those who know Quantum Physics would be bored to coma. Perhaps the best part of the book was the definition they quoted from Feynman, that it was the description of the behaviour of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Besides that, the whole book read like a product of copy and paste here and there from science journals more than anything else.<br />Despite the above, the authors were clever at choosing the right facts and figures. Some astounding items include:-<br />1. The only original DJI stock left behind after a century was General Electric.<br />2. In 1989, Intel launched i486, a chip that features 1.2 million transistors. In 2001, Intel launched P4 which contains 43 million transistors.<br />3. In 1997, IBM installed Deep Blue. It could evaluate 200 million chess positions per second, and defeated the world chess champion Gary Kasparov. In 2001, IBM installed ASCI White, which is 1000 times faster than Deep Blue.<br />In short, this book is far from what the title projects to say. Little is talked about investment at all. The authors could have written a much better book with much fewer words. To make it better, the authors should have written much more on how complexity theory, a branch in Quantum Physics could really help market and investment analysis.uantum Physics could really help market and investment analysis.	2003-08-16

I fully understand so because I did have negative feeling of it, which only improved gradually from page to page. In the beginning, the book really seems so complicated, full of jargons, candlestick charts elaborating on chart patterns with little reference to oscillator indicators like MACD, Stochastics, which I personally believe the alignment of several of them to be a prerequisite for any profitable trade. In the end, I realized that if I didnt put so much emphasis on the words \\"Swing Trading\\" and its virtual difference with \\"Momentum Trading\\" which the author criticized much, this book is not so bad when considered to be a general trading book with above average practical advice.<br />Amongst others, I found the following so called 7 Bells, tools to locate outstanding opportunities most interesting.<br />1. Dip Trip - Price that moves against a strong trend will rebound sharply<br />2. Coiled Spring - Constricted price gives way to directional movement<br />3. Finger Finder - Candles flag reversals in the next smaller time frame.<br />4. Hole in the wall - Gap downs after strong rallies signal a trend change<br />5. Power Spike - High volume events print the future diretion of price (Big volume kills a trend)<br />6. Bear Hug - Weak markets drop quickly after rallying into resistance<br />7. 3rd Watch - Breakouts through triple tops signal major uptrends<br />In a word, this book is quite a helpful tool of reference amidst the competitive life of trading which regular glance of its graphs do help much to refresh one's mind. Complex, time consuming but well worths the price.	2003-08-08

(He belongs to the rare breed that predicted a rise in the stock market in 2003). He is certainly talented with his critical mind, backed by his educational training as a genuine scholar in statistics. The problem is: Such qualities do not guarantee the output of an intersting and productive \\"trading\\" book.<br />Two years ago on Amazon, I put very harsh comment on his first book \\"The Art of speculation\\". I rated it one star because I felt cheated to pay for a trading book which had a 90% ego centric content, talking all the time about his father, hobbies and non trading side of life....This book, \\"Practical Speculation\\", is certainly much more relevant. However, as a trader and a trading book lover, I am so disappointed to find it not so practical. The only thing I can recall after reading it is that it stresses on the importance \\"to be on guard against the propaganda of analysts, media, news and have a scientific mind on everything, that everything should be tested and proved before you believe it, in particular against the many technical analysis tools and gurus.\\" However, isnt that a prerequisite for the survival of any trader preached in almost every other trading book and isnt that a failure in the authors' part in making it so boring and dull with 350+ pages?<br />p.s. The authors used the first 14 pages to recap how they, particularly Victor, had been ridiculed after his failure in 1997. That's the most interesting part of the whole book and you can tell Victor will certainly come back after you read that. I just feel sorry for those who have bought the book for going through that part in a book store, like my stupid self.	2003-08-07

I truly believe that Mark Fisher is a great trader and his ACD trading system is one of the best. Who am I to stand opposite to Paul Tudor Jones who wrote in the Foreword that besides the four Bibles of the business (Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Lefevre, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by McGee and Edwards, The Elliot Wave Theorist by Prechter and Market Wizards by Schwager), he was going to add this book to his list of must reads for beginning traders.<br /><br />The critical drawback is, unless you subscribe with a fee to the author's research material or become his client (MBF is the largest clearing firm in the Nymex), you dont know what those time, trading period and vehicle specific inputs for the ACD system are, and everything written in the book becomes sales talk alike.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with respect to Tudor Jones, I do agree with his compliment of Chapter 7 (The ACD version of Ripley's Believe it or Not) that it \\"presents incredible, real stories from the trading pit. Experienced traders will see themselves and their flaws in these stories, while novices can learn from these professional traders' mistakes\\".

Inevitably, I had great expectation of what the author would give after nine more years of the game.

However, though market psychology doesnt change, technology and the speed and means of information distribution do, leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends, inevitably attacking the weakest link of the Dow Theory which is that confirmation of the primary and long term trend almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.<br />I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. Nevertheless, considering the high price of the book and the long time to read it through, there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a very exhaustive reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA. The new appendix of MACD, Stochastics etc is adequate but far from sufficient. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal.	2003-07-19

This could be attributed to that the author could not get direct info from Soros or his associates at all. Without the burden of returning any favor, the author could quote whatever and whoever (some ex Soros partners) he liked, particularly criticisms, which were the most interesting parts of the book. Other parts, like how Soros broke the Bank of England, how he identified with his Hungarian Jewish identity, how he failed to become a philospher and turned into a trader, should be good enough to satisfy most readers' curiosity on the early part (on or before 1994) of Soro's life. For those traders who want to know the trading secrets, go somewhere else.<br />p.s. As a trader, I still would like to quote something from the book for my fellows' reference:-<br />1. Page 60: What Soros understood better than most were the cause and effect relationships in the world's economies. If A happened, that B must follow, then C after that.<br />2. Page 83: The stock market is always wrong, so that if you copy everybody else on Wall Street, you're doomed to do poorly.<br />3. Page 85: In 1979, Soros renamed his fund...Quantum Fund, in tribute to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. That principle asserts that it is impossible to predict the behavior of subatomic particples in quantum mechanics, an idea that meshed with Soros's conviction that markets were always in a state of uncertainty and flux that it was possible to make money by discounting the obvious, and betting on the unexpected.<br />4. Page 92: Soros always says that you shouldnt be in the market unless you are willing to take the pain.<br />5. Page 110: Short term volatility is greatest at turning points and diminishes as a trend becomes established.<br />6. Page 159: It is not whether you are right or wrong, but how much money you make when you are right and how much money you lose when you are wrong....If you have tremendous conviction on a trade you have to go for the jugular.It takes courage to be a pig.

First, one must get the facts of a situation or problem. Second, one must form a judgement as to what those facts portend. Third, one must act in time before it is too late.<br />2. Page 183: ...when money came into the hands of people too easily. Such money did not seem real. When men tossed around such huge sums in bets....they had lost all sense of value and of economics. No market in the hands of such people could be a stable or genuine one.....behind their bantering I sensed a feeling of insecurity, as if they were talking strong to cover up their own weaknesses.<br />3. Page 184: To enjoy the advantages of a free market one must have both buyers and sellers, both bulls and bears. A market without bears would be like a nation without a free press. There would be no one to criticise and restrain the false optimism that always leads to disaster.<br />4. Page 248: The true speculator is one who observes teh future and acts before it occurs.

Even worse, the cases just did not help at all.<br />In a word, a big disappointment for this one and I suggest those who would like to give the author a try to bet on his first book &quot;Trading Rules: Strategies for success&quot;.	2003-06-29

Based on his notion that performance outcome is influenced by seven sets of factors (determination, energy, perspective, courage, focus, poise, resilience), the author elaborates on how we can arm ourselves with mastery in the above seven areas to undertake challenge in any field. That's quite the normal setting in any self help book. However, I do like the author's clear, logical and straight to the point writing, without the excessive and tedious examples anonymous commonly found in most self help books. The five page Chapter Eight, so named a synthesis: putting it altogether, (the seven set of factors were grouped into seven individual chapters), simply tells how \\"to the point\\" the author had been. In a word, a very good read.<br />p.s. I like the saying in front of each chapter much.

I like his books and tapes much. They are very helpful during my trouble times and I am ready to recommend them, particulary the \\"Get the Edge\\" and \\"Personal Power\\" tapes, to anyone who wants to get motivated and take action. I like Tony' style of presenting things in a logical, rational and friendly manner, elaborating points clearly with great life examples that you can remember and apply them in your life. I particularly like his tapes because he is a great speaker who really can move your heart with his passionate tone and manner (you cant see it but you can feel him moving his arms, for sure).<br /><br />Back to this book. As it is written in a 365 day diary format with a short passage devoting to independent topics, the bondage between individual passages becomes a little bit weak. I agree with a reviewer that this can be a light and interesting reading on journeys. However, accustomed to taking Tony's works as living guides/tool books, I prefer to rate it a three star relatively to the normal five star in praise of Tony's many other great works.	2003-06-24

When I was reading this book, I kept on praying to God to forgive my pride and ignorance of overlooking the very deep and wide meaning Christ put into the Lord's Prayer. Now I agree with what Martin Luther said, as quoted by the author, that &quot;I am convinced that when a Christian rightly prays the Lord's Prayer at any time...their praying is more than adequate.&quot; and what Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, that &quot;The Lord's Prayer is the quintessence of prayer. A disciple's prayer is founded on and circumscribed by it.&quot;<br />In short, it is a book that no real Christian should miss. Actually, I nearly missed it. Thanks to God, I didnt, because I came across the following on the back cover:-<br />&quot;Lord, Teach Us to Pray is biblically sound, spiritually rich, and intellectually stimulating. Boers shows the &quot;Our Father&quot; as prayer that is as wide as it is deep: it embraces all humanity's yearnings and touches the inner depths of the human heart. &quot;<br /> - Henri Nouwen	2003-06-24

Adopting a step by step approach, he first outlined and explained a number of TA methods, and then reduced these methods to the four steps of trading success he promoted, which are:-<br />1. Determine the major trend of the day<br />2. Determine the minor trend of the day<br />3. Define an exact entry point<br />4. Determine an exit strategy<br />In my opinion, this book is really helpful and easy to understand. There is plenty of 1-min graphs elaborating the author’s ideas, primarily for stock day trading. Though the prinicples are quite applicable also for longer term trading, I hope that the author will write another book for those position traders like myself.	2003-06-24

I should have saved my time and money if I knew that the author had written another book \\"How to Have a No 1 Hit Single: (And What to Do If You Don't)\\". I later found that the author was a TV broadcaster and just took the advantage of the internet bubble to write something for the mass market.<br /><br />Anyway, the title and the editorial review in both the front and the back cover is quite misleading.

Quite to my surprise, this book really delivers what it's title promises, that it can really be taken as a \\"guide\\" to profit from news and other market-moving events.<br /><br />In fact, this is a book of fundamental/macro-economics analysis. Distinguishing itself from others, it is full of lively and vivid examples that readers can easily put the propositions into practice, with little modification, though the result is not guaranteed in this increasingly competitive market. Nevertheless, the if X, buy 1 and if Y, sell 2 approach can really speed up the learning curve of nearly all beginners.<br /><br />One drawback: Although the author did mention the many \\"traps\\" in the market, the tone of these warnings was too light compared to the rosy pictures painted by the author himself on the effectiveness of his approach. As I mentioned before, there are more and more traps nowadays with the increasing employment of derivatives by professional traders. I think that the author should elaborate more on this respect.<br /><br />Anyway, worth the price and the time.	2003-06-09

The author had just put the histories of all Islam related tribes, countries and empires into this single book. That's all. Very politically correct, resulting a very plain, and even  shallow description of a \\"seemingly\\" loosely related group of people labeled as \\"Muslims\\", talking little about their religious beliefs and the driving force behind the many historical and religious events.<br />In short, not recommended, unless you want to find a book that allows you to do some copy and paste for your secondary school history homework.	2003-06-02

Muhammed preached the supremancy of Koran and himself over Bible, other prophets and even Jesus (Muhammed actually denied resurrection of Jesus and Jesus's identity as the Son of God, and only took him as a prophet). Beside, the nature and the \\"personality\\" of the monotheistic God Muhammed described in Koran are so fundamentally different from those of the God described in Bible. The author had quoted from both Koran and Bible to elaborate on the above incompatibilities. Well, he really did a good job.<br /><br />The simple \\"No\\" above did not to me easily and directly. I had checked many books for the above three questions. However, many authors tried so hard to be politically correct and avoided direct discussion of the many discrepancies between Koran and Bible.<br /><br />In short, this is an excellent tool book for Christians who really want to understand more of who they believe and how to defend their religion when needed.	2003-06-02

The book began with the author's recall of the suicide of his bond trader friend who lost about US$60K in one single Friday in 1982. Quite a sad story, but it did tell how serious the author was about trading and his sincerity of writing a good book that attempted to help traders and those aspiring ones. In my opinion, he did a very good job.<br /><br />With fifty chapters of individual trading rules (one can refer to the sample page on Amazon.com), the author had discussed, with abundant real life samples, and without nonsense, most of the essential trading rules that I had read here and there in other trading books and had personally experienced, though not effectively put into practice. One might had already read a lot of trading books. I did. However, this one was so well written and organised that I would like to recommend it to anybody who wants to buy a book for easy reference to keep himself/herself well guarded against the ups and downs of trading life.	2003-05-16

The book is quite disorganised as a whole. Furthermore, there's little practical advice in behaviour finance and trading/investment psychology as suggested by the book title. Perhaps I might feel better with it after a second reading as suggested by another reviewer. However, the frustrating feeling deters me from doing so coz I really did not have such bad feeling in reading similar books, such as \\"Beyond Greed and Fear: Understanding Behavioral Finance and the Psychology of Investing by Hersh Shefrin\\" and \\"The Psychology of Finance by Lars Tvede\\". Put it straight, there are much better alternatives for readers interested in this topic.<br /><br />p.s.

The rest of the book is not.	Thanks to the reviewers of this book that I had borrowed rather than bought one, and am here to proudly tell you I had wasted twenty bucks less.<br /><br />In short, this is a trading book of the interview type. The problems are: 1) The interviewees are far less famous than those in &#34;Market Wizards I&II&#34;. 2) The author's fixation on &#34;identify trends, cut losses, maximize profit and manage risk&#34; (with questions like &#34;Do you think X (any one of the above four &#34;principles&#34;) is important?&#34; had limited the scope of replies and made it much less useful and interesting than it could be. Indeed, many interviewees simply replied with &#34;yes&#34; and &#34;no&#34;, and the author oddly didnt drill further. 3) The author's deliberate separation of it into the four main principles/chapters had made the whole book incohesive and hard to read. For example, the opinion of Jake Bernstein (a writer who wrote over 20 trading books) was placed here and there that a holistic view of his trading strategy can hardly be grasped at all.<br /><br />In short, just borrow one if you really want to read it.	2003-05-01

Content wise, it's incredible. It's full of real life stories, data, analyses, propositions of many so called market anomalies. However, I really find some of the chapters too long, especially those after chapter 5. The author had copied his style of thesis writing and actually many of his own theses (he's a renowed professor after all) into a book which has a big audience group of investors or traders who want quick fix or certain level of entertainment and personal improvement. In these respects, the \\"Psychology of Finance by Lars Tvede\\" and the \\"Devil take the hindmost by Edward Chancellor\\" are \\"easier\\" but not definitely better alternatives.<br /><br />Anway, this is one of the very few \\"serious\\" books about behavioural finance that is relatively practical. If you are abound of time, go for it. Otherwise, you may try the two books I mentioned above.<br /><br />p.s. I like the following the most: In April 1997 Financial Times ran a contest suggested by economist Richard Thaler. Readers were told to choose a whole number between 0 and 100. The winning entry would be the one closest to two thirds of the average entry. The winning choice is 13. The real point of this game is that playing sensibly requires you to have a sense of the magnitude of the other players' errors. Hope you got it right.	2003-04-29

Even the author himself pointed out that the success rate for the conversion of ex institutional traders to independent traders was very low owing to the much higher psychological load of trading one's own money than that of trading OPM.<br />Despite the over-promise of the book title and the second half  of it discussing mostly technical tools, the book is quite well written. There are plenty of bright ideas, some with originality that can be attributed to the author's M.D. and psychiatrist background.  In particular I like the following points much:-<br />- That trading is a minus sum game (considering commission and slippage) and the mass media or gurus or prevalent market view are almost always wrong.<br />- The analogy of the market as an ocean and a huge crowd of people, in either case an individual can have no control of but have to follow (or leave) emotionlessly for long term profit.<br />- The analogy of Alcoholic Anonymous with Loser Anonymous that requires the same treatment for true recovery, whereas accepting oneself as an alcoholic or a loser is the very first step of healing.<br />- The need for discipline and patience as individual traders' only weapon to against institutional traders advantages in faster information, better research reports, lower psychological burden for trading OPM, etc<br />- Price is a psychological event, a momentary balance of opinion between bulls and bears, its pattern reflects the mass psychology of the market.<br />- Last but not least, the opening prices are determined primarily by amateurs whilst the closing prices are determined by professionals.<br />In short, the book is well worth the price and I do recommend it to those who study continuously for self improvement in their trading. Remarks:- The author claimed that he personally did so, too.	2003-04-06

The exceptionally long 26 page foreword by the Chicago U Professor Robert Aliber also gives any green reader a good summary of the existing economic structure of Japan.<br />However, as a professional trader with heavy trading in dollar yen for nearly a decade, I dont find the book useful. The so claimed original hypotheses which link the periodic sharp upswings of the yen to poor economic performance and the arrogance of BOJ governors, are definitely nothing new. Contrary to what printed in the back cover, no practical advice had been offered to investors at all. The future of yen is still at the mercy of the BOJ governor, if not God, when no fundamental change of the existing bureaucracy is within sight.<br />In short, if you want a resource book, this is okay. If you want a trading or investment book, look somewhere else.	2003-03-25

Unless you get what you deserve or your system/style really works, what you earned is just what you borrowed, as concluded by the author of &quot;When Genius failed&quot;, an account of rise and fall of the Long Term Capital Management, the once biggest of all funds.<br />In this book, the author, with his time proved success in fund management, told the readers, in the format of newspaper columns, his failures, successes, thoughts and thus hard earned productive experience about how to survive in the markets. The stories are interesting, concise, and easy to understand. As a veteran trader, I can tell the book is so valuable in reminding me of, thus deserving a regular rereading of it, what I easily forgot in the so exhausting trading war field.<br />To end my review, I would like to copy a few words for anybody's reference:-<br />&quot;But it's the pigs who get slaughtered. It's the investor who loads up on a single position and crosses his fingers and waits for that big move that will carry him home. It's the investor who has a full position in a commodity, and the contract moves in his favor, and he responds by loading up past all reasonable and prudent risk. These are the pigs, and they are slaughtered with distressing regularity.<br />At the very least, set a stop loss that preserves some profit on a winner.

Before I read this book, I thought that I had quite an understanding of what happened to LTCM and the highly volatile market during Aug/Sept 1998. The book told me how ignorant I had been.<br />In that period, some hedge funds were raiding HK, or simply all the world's markets. I remember that on one Sunday Drunkenmiller, the arm of Soros, had made a public statement to all HK people that HK govt's intervention would eventually turn futile leaving everyone poorer the next morning. Of course, we now know what happened, though the argument whether the HK govt should have intervened at all and the genuine effect of such is still a mystery. Shamelessly the HK government just took all the credit without any attribution to the series of events brought about by the default of the Russian govt debt and the animous contraction of credit lines by banks to hedge funds which led to the exodus of even profitable positions of hedge funds to meet margin calls and the so claimed success of HK govt's intervention.<br />Anyway, the author did a good job of telling a story in a highly interesting manner. The charcters were vividly projected and the many causes that brought forward the whole debacle had been disclosed, amongst others, the relentless greed and pride of the LTCM partners, the indulgence and the uncontrolled urge for profit/ business from the banks, the neglience or perhaps ignorance of FED or specifically Greenspan on the destructive power of derviatives, the over reliance of the public on World Bank/IMF as a last resort, the frontrunning by some private bankers and traders, .....simply anything you can think of about Wall Street, a place where money is king, and moral and honor simply do not exist.<br />Actually I have been really sad after reading the book. Our financial system had just been so fragile, and the mistake/selfishness of a handful can easily sacrifice the interest of the countless mass.

I am deeply impressed by the author's critical thinking and his courage for challenging \\"popular\\" thoughts and gurus/academics/masters of universe who are more successful (in wealth and fame) than the author himself.<br />With vivid use of interesting stories and histories, the author points out that we, human beings, are probability blind (fooled by randomness). For \\"long term\\" investment and trading success, we have to fight hard against our natural instincts, that we should use mathematics as a means of thinking instead of computing; that we should be aware of the noise (non significant price fluctuations), randomness of pure conincidence in past incidents, survivorship bias etc before  drawing causalties; that of solon's warning of \\"it aint over until it's over\\"; that of the possibility of a quantum leap/jump (non linearity) instead of a gradual change of events .... and many other biases and misunderstandings.<br />In case you still dont have a clue of what I wrote above and just wanna know whether you really need this book or not, please give the following quiz (pg. 159) a try:-<br />A test of a disease presents a rate of 5% false positives. The disease strikes 1/1000 of the population. People are tested at random, regardless of whether they are suspected of having the disease. A patient's test is positive.

The answer is the conditional probability that the patient is sick and the test shows it - close to 2%. Less than one in five professionals got it right.<br />If you dont get the above right, I strongly recommend you to buy the book. It will give you a preventive shot against the faults and errors inherent in your journalists' investment reports.<br />p.s. (Ans: Out of 1000 patients who are administered the test, one will be expected to be afflicted. Therefore 999 are healthy but the test will identify about 50 with the disease (it is 95% accurate).

Of course, common sense, though not really common, tells us something otherwise.<br /><br />In this book, many historical examples had been quoted about how those genuine contrarians bought on panic and sold on eurphoria, and it's only when the market consensus was at its extreme that the contrarian play would pay. It makes no sense just to think that you are playing opposite to the crowd whilst you simply belong to one of them.<br /><br />In this respect, the authors had put forth a contrarian system for investors to follow, rules based on value/fundamental investing but with solid technical elements of when to enter a market and when to stop profit/loss. So called real life stories and testimonials to support the authors' theories and propositions are abundant everywhere. Psychology behind a trend is vividly elaborated.<br /><br />I think that the book is a good leisure reading for veterans and a good starter for beginners. Definitely you wont get bored. The lovely pigs on the front cover do tell something about how the authors would like it to be.<br /><br />p.s.

I don't personally know Jack, of course. However, for an outsider like me who just want to learn about how Jack had made GE that very successful, my objective had by and large been achieved. Not only successful stories, but also failures, had been covered with reviews by the decision maker himself. I forgot in which issue of Harvard Business Review this year that some scholars attributed the quality of the CEO to be the primary determinant of the fate of a corporation. This book, and the performance of Jack and GE, did give the aforesaid theory a big support.<br /><br />p.s. What Jack did in the past two decades had reminded me of a Chinese saying, &#34;The success of a general is built upon tens of thousands of dead bodies&#34; (skeletons, to be exact). Perhaps that's the cruelty of the business world.	2002-12-25

I first read this and its elder sister &#34;How to win friends and influence people&#34; near 1986. That was when I was trying to save myself from the very deep sorrow of losing my first love in life, a girl who I had been with for four unforgettable years since high school. Those two books helped me much, really much. In the past 15 years, during the ups and downs of my life, I always went back to them and got the comfort and advice I needed, besides the Bible. I hope that people who suffer much from worry and sorrow can get the same help from those books  as I do. In fact, I am confident that they will.	2002-11-10

However, I did expect a summary or two about the life, trading or investment methods of the people covered in it. The passage devoted to Bernard Baruch is a rare gem. A pity that it was mostly copy and paste from the works of other authors. Even worse, the content is not timely. For e.g., the article about Robertson was written nearly a decade before the Tiger Fund got drown in Russia. It would be much better if the author had written several volumes and covered more and timely of each guru.	2002-11-01

This book is essentially a collection of Krugman's short articles from various sources in 1996 and 1997. I read some of them online after the 97 Asian Crisis. Today is 24th Oct 2002. What, and simply all, he said are still true today. He's a genius and really deserves a Nobel prize. To me, he already has. I think it becomes more appropriate to quote the praise of  a Nobel Laureate from the back cover of the book than to write more myself:-(I checked that it's not on the editorial review here on Amazon)<br /><br />\\"When it comes to popularized economic wisdom, there are a lot of balloons of ignorance out there, many of them reinforced by self interest and self confidence.

It's the no nonsense, to the point content that drove me to recommend it to anybody who would like to know more about how to improve a company's bottomline through differentiation in service. Charts, graphs, adages, examples (of Disney, SKF bearing, McDonlad, UPS....) are abundant, telling how a company, particulary the top management whose involvement is necessary to make a real difference, should plan and execute a strategy in service. The seven chapters are well written with excellent elaboration, and I like the summary, and the do's and don'ts much in the end of each chapter very much. In a word, a good read!	2002-10-18

I expected to see something about how some investment bankers blinded by money, tons of money, had squeezed their clients through quasi-unethical practice. The authors did satisfy some of my wishes, say, on how they manipulated the valuation through creative use of \\"Comparable Multiples Analysis\\" and \\"Discounted Cash Flow Analysis\\", and the indiscreet \\"Due Diligence Practice\\". However, the majority of the book told the working life and sufferings of the two junior bankers (the authors themselves) and their ultimate self redemption.<br />I think most of the insiders and investment bankers can have fun reading a book that they can identify themselves with. However, for non bankers who want to gain more insight on the industry as a whole and read something more relevant (and more sacrastic and hilarious) to their investment interest, especially on what those bankers are selling you, Liar's Poker and Fiasco are certainly better alternatives.	2002-10-15

Not from hindsight (of the index level today), but sheerly by content, the book is full of flaws in nearly every topic it covers, especially those on Technical Analysis. Facts, and pure facts were abundant. However, trading system, strategy and insight were in short supply. The authors might have been so optimisstic and carried away by the beautiful picture they painted about trading in Nasdaq that money management and discipline had rarely been mentioned, and the &quot;real tactics for real profits anytime anywhere&quot; on the front cover were by and large absent.<br />p.s. This book contains the highest number of cartoon (eight) in those trading books I ever read. Sadly, most were drawn with one single theme, that &quot;Day Trading would annihilate the brokers&quot;. That should have implied something about the direction and quality of the book, which I had mistakenly ignored.	2002-10-15

However, the author might have been so used to his newsletter style, that the book is a little bit disorganised and one star is deducted.<br />Anyway, the book is well dosed with market anomalies, adages, technical methods and useful stuff. I dont mean that all the materials are useful. I do cast doubt on some of his program trading methods (which gave an ROE of over 10000%) which I think the calculation had been manipulated from hindsight. Nevertheless, what the author said is by and large applicable.<br />Emphasis was placed on 1)trading system, 2) money management, 3) patience + knowledge + focus as the essentials for successful trading. Not secrets, right? Most of the trading books in the market talked about these. It's just that the author had more credibility and better story telling skills. I believe most traders would enjoy reading it, especially those chapters telling the author's failures or copying his past newsletters.<br />p.s. I would like to quote two phrases here.<br />\\"I have developed a powerful and profitable belief system: I believe the current trade I am in will be a loser... a big loser at that.\\" (Stops are must)<br />\\"If you cant follow it, what good is a system or strategy?\\"	2002-10-03

I had read Douglas's Trading in the Zone before. I had a very high expectation on this one. However, I was very disappointed.<br />The author emphasized throughout the book the importance of entering the zone, a state of mind that you can neglect fear, greed, P/L, and just trade according to your feeling of the market, though he supplemented that with the need of analysis, hardwork, focus blah blah blah, and that different people have different means to enter the zone, illustrated with examples anonymous. Those might be true stories. However, the author just did not tell the readers how they could do it themselves without the assistance of a coach like the author's good self.<br />A reviewer of this book wrote that this should be read together with Douglas's Trading in the Zone and Mc Call's The Way of the Warrior Trader. One should read those two excellent books only, but definitely not this.	2002-09-24

Best for the veteran traders	You seldom find in the universe of trading books that a trader will use more passages to cover stories about his failure than success. This is just a rare breed. Perhaps Kroll was confident enough to do so with the backup of his outstanding trading record, and his determination to write a superb trading book.<br />To me, this is a modern day Reminiscences Of a Stock Operator ROSO. Of course, Kroll and his book are not as &quot;great&quot; as Livermore and ROSO. However, the tone/style of the books are not so distant, and so are their values. In fact, Kroll had voiced out his admiration for Livermore.<br />In short, cut loss short, keep profit run, plan your game well, focus on the major trend and buy on its minor retracement, keep absolutely calm and relaxed, see lights across the board and not just of what you trade, trade opposite to the news on mass media, mind the single/double day reversal, the sardine story (some commodities are for trading and not for eating), not to be worried about the beginning of a big trend coz it always lasts longer than most people expect, go along with the technical when it clearly shows something at variance with the psychology of the market, and much more wise words are present in this book.<br />As a value added service, I would like to quote one passage here for your reference.<br /><br />&quot;There's a great tendency to get carried away by the prevailing market psychology at that time and not doing any liquidating. But you've got to resist that tendency. When the market attains that major price objective, where you had projected closing out, say, half the position, do it. If you dont, you will probably regret it later.&quot;<br />In a word, a must read.<br />p.s. The only bad thing of this book is the exceptionally poor front cover design.	2002-09-22

What upsets me most is the author's poor market advice/application on every right page of a [strange] Sun Tzu's adage in the Art of War on every left page. First, there was always no relationship between the two.

The first one is &quot;Investment Quotient&quot; which I gave my highest rating. That does not lead to my negative comment on this one because of over expectation. It's just that the content and quality of this so named guide just cannot be described as compleat.<br />In one single book of only 200 pages, Jake tried to discuss many important elements of day trading, including history, mechanism, player characteristics, market structure and even sophisticated technical tools like Stochastics, MACD, Momentum, various forms of Moving Average and even AI. The problem is: he tried to cover so many things that the whole book becomes very shallow and far from what is needed for this highly risky game.<br />I dont understand why many reviewers gave this book such high ratings. I am afraid that many amateurs had already been lured to enter the game under the false illusion that they became  better, if not well equipped, after reading this book, and had already fallen prey to the market crocs.	2002-09-16

Can be a classic	If somebody reads one book, makes minor revision and prints it, that's plagiarism. If he/she reads ten, that's scholarship. If the number goes to a hundred, it is mastership, my appreciation of the author and his masterpiece.<br />There are countless books on either history of the investment market, or trading psychology, or technical analysis. This book is a rare breed that incorporates several dimensions into one. Chart reading, with elaboration of four basic market rules (1. market is ahead 2. market is irrational 3. environment is chaotic 4. charts are self fulfilling) interrelated with different schools of psychological theories (Behaviorist, Gestalt, Cognitive, Psychoanalysis), form the stem of this beautiful book with vivid &#34;green leaves&#34; of writings on momentum, sizing, turning points.....<br />One great strength of it is that one does not need to know much about psychology to understand what the author tries to tell, because tables of examples are abundant to let you know when you have made specific mistakes. He does not teach you how to correct them, but it does lead the way of self improvement and really help to enlighten your trading style.<br />It should be in any serious trader's bookshelf for fast recollection of some important trading principles, a regular dosage for cleansing mental dirt accumulated throughout his/her harsh trading life.	2002-09-15

Otherwise, I would have missed such an excellent read.<br />In a word, this short book is a concise but intelligent collection of what Buffett said about life, work, running a business, investing blah blah blah. It easily convinces me why Buffett is the most successful investor (he's the richest guy) nowadays. Things are always easier said than done, but Buffett proved that he had done what he said. I had read many books about Buffett and value investing. I think this is by far the best considering its high value/quality per page.

Whilst so much of it (about 35%) was written, in text and no data/graph, to validate value over price as the primary consideration of any investment, that made the part on the assessment of the true value of a stock too simple and short.<br />In a word, this is like the introduction or the first chapter of a 12 chapter book. I strongly suggest any aspired value investor to read the originals of Graham and Buffet for a full picture before they take up one of the most competitive and demanding jobs in the world.	2002-08-18

However, in a trader reader perspective, it is at least 2,000 pips (in yen/$ term, the range in 2002) below the quality level of \\"Reminiscences of a stock operator\\" and \\"Pit Bull\\".

(I keep on reading and I had even gone so far to get a CFA) I dont write this paragraph for self boasting. I just want to emphasize that the author really had delivered what is implied in the book title \\"Rules of the trade - indispensable ...\\".<br />Neatly structured, the book consists of 12 paragraphs, each of which about a specific topic, such as rules for the stock selection, rules for entering trades, rules for evaluating performances, rules for money and mind management, rules for this and rules for that...In the beginning of each chapter, related rules are listed.<br />In \\"the rules for exiting trades\\", to name a few: dont expect to squeeze all the juice from the orange; exit on reaction, not price; set mental stops; when in doubt, get out; know why you are in a trade, and where you will exit etc.<br />In the rules for active traders: size the trade; average winners, not losers; never let a winner turn into a loser; take profits often; never mix disciplines; dont fight the tape etc.<br />In the rules for the technician: day trade the range and swing trade the trends; always use indicators to confirm charts and patterns; dont make it rocket science, cause it aint; never ignore volume regardless of your trading style etc.<br />To me, this book is an easy read, well written but still can serve as a good reminder of things I know I need to remember but had somehow forgotten after intensive trading activities. Not a classic nor really insightful, but definitely good value for money!<br />p.s. The author had named 10 books of note in the Appendix. Four of them would be in my own list of top 10 recommendations. That might be the reason why I consider this book so readable.	2002-07-22

After I read thru it, I do agree with their praise, but not more.<br />This book is an extension and a modification of Mr. Ellis's ground breaking paper in 1975, a piece of the early groundwork of contemporary investment philosophy - The Portfolio Theory, that investors can never beat the market in the long run by market timing, and that return is always proportional to the amount of market risk one takes, (the Capital Asset Pricing Model stuff). Investors therefore should consider their own conditions well to determine the level of risk to be taken and to choose the right type/span of investment or investment fund or fund managers, blah blah blah, things you should have heard of if you are a frequent attendant in mutual/index fund sales events or investment seminars.<br />As a CFA charterholder, I have no problem in knowing what the core message is all about. (Mr. Ellis had chaired AIMR, the parent association of CFA. I found that on the bottom flip of the book cover) However, I doubt it very much whether a normal investor can appreciate that or not. The dilemma being that if you understand the book well (which I do), you might find the book a little bit boring (137 pages of one major message and mediocre writing skill). If you cant understand it that well, you will have little impetus to read on. In either case, you are playing the loser's game.	2002-07-06

However, I must state that in the early chapters, Tharp had given lively illustrations of how people try to search for the holy grail (an invincible trading system/formula) in the market, the destined futility of such, and the importance of market timing and selection. It's a pity that only the beginning part is in place. The interested readers got to find much of the content and the ending elsewhere.	2002-06-26

(I always have the opinion that for improvement in behavioral psychology, a systematic approach that guide the readers step by step and in great detail is a must).<br />To echo on my review, I would like to quote what's written on the first sentence of the conclusion chapter. -----&quot;Life would be a lot simpler if we could summarize the ideas presented in this book with a set of prescriptive nuggest - &quot;The top ten mental moneys secret&quot; or &quot;The seven habits of financially effective people.&quot; Unfortunately, there are no easy fixes for many of the issues we've touched upon.

Bascially this book is a collection of eleven chapters contributed by eleven authors, professors...but not serious fund managers or traders, with highly diversified investment and writing skills.<br />Personally I have no bias towards any profession. However, I have the perception accumulated from my past reading experience that non trader authors are quite inclined to put their emphasis on elaborating their theories to describe what happened, providing elegant data (weakly applicable here) to support their arguments, but doing little on solving nor advising on the problems, and thus failing to satisfy the primary objective of most readers in buying an investment or trading book. This book just reinforced my perception in this respect.<br />There are many much better trading psychology books in the market like Trader Vic I, Investment Quotient, Trading in the Zone blah blah blah.

Otherwise, please dont bother to do more harm than good to your existing investment means or methodology, if you have any.<br /><br />Basically, this is a trading psychology book about how to become a consistently successful trader, who, in the author's opinion, owns the primary characteristic of a pro gambler, a probabilistic mindset consisting of five fundamental truths, including 1) anything can happen 2) you dont need to know what is going to happen next in order to make money 3) there is a random distribution between wins and losses for any given set of variables that define an edge 4) an edge is nothing more than an indication of a higher probability of one thing happening over another 5) every moment in the market is unique.<br /><br />The author preaches that only traders, who have the pro gambler mindset suffer the least from selective perception, part of their innate mental defense mechanism, are more ready to react to what the market is offering at the moment, cut their loss with less pain and accumulate their profit with less fear. As a pro trader, I really buy into that.<br /><br />Easier said than done, right? The author knows what most of his readers think and so he devoted half of the book (about 100 pages) to the discussion of psychology to appeal to the readers' rational minds for the building into them new beliefs of the importance of that pro gambler mindset, whilst the other half of the book elaborating the means to develop that.<br /><br />As I wrote in the first paragraph, any reader who does not know the difference between trading and investing will not understand what the author is talking about, all the worse when the word gambling carries so strong a negative or evil sense with it. You can tell how few the number of people who are willing to regard themselves as gamblers, nor to think like one. That might be the reason why there are so many one star reviews claiming that it is just another Anthony Robbin book, and thus so few winners in the market.<br /><br />p.s. I had found it difficult to decide my rating of this book because the first three or four chapters had been quite boring to those who know fairly about psychology. No matter what, this is definitely an insightful book not to be missed.one.

I bought it because the title is so far the most attractive amongst its keens. \\"Get Better or Get Beaten\\" is certainly the norm in today's competitive world. Remarkably, the content is of the same quality as its title. It is so well written that I finished it in 1.5 day.<br /><br />In fact, the core concepts or the secrets are nothing new. Quality and Re-engineering gurus like Peter Drucker, Philip Crosby, Tom Peters etc had stressed the importance of quality, customer orientation, corporate culture, employee involvement blah blah blah for decades. It's just that Jack Welch had been so successful a real life practitioner and advocate that nobody can neglect. Think about the 6 sigma phenomenon and you know what I mean.<br /><br />In case you just want to know the secrets without the elaboration, or that you cannot afford one, go to the table of content (Thanks to Amazon) and have a look. All the secrets are already there. (Sorry, Mr. Slater).  However, I still think it is a good collectible for your personal library.<br /><br />p.s. I had worked in an acquired subsidiary of a Fortune 20 company. I am sorry that what happened there was far from what Mr. Welch preached.

It is the best part of the book, in my opinion.<br /><br />Second, talk about trading psychology. Ask readers whether they have goals, plans, strategies, the right motive (money should never be the first priority, they said) before any trade. Ask them to model themselves after successful traders to have edges in discipline, focus, knowledge...If you dont follow these and you dont know how to answer the questions, that's your fault.

Appeal to experts, for the name of Thomas Edison and President Lincoln, can heighten trustworthiness.<br /><br />Fifth, show charts and graphs, talk about technical analysis so that everything looks more scientific. 40 pages<br /><br />Sixth, conclude that if readers can cut loss short, let profit ride, discipline themselves then they will be winners. The authors had not told you how but they had done their part. If the reader fails, it's just that he/she does not follow the teachings or lessons good enough. 30 pages<br /><br />I am sorry to say so but I have to conclude that the authors just want cash in on their dubious trading knowledge (being in the trade is different from trading successfully), relation with institutions and the urge of market participants for trading advice.

I really think Krugman deserves a Nobel prize. He is a brilliant story teller, using a lot of interesting parables (I like very much his analogy of, as Krugman named it, the liquidity trap in Japan}, though he attributes that to his editors. One chapter after the other, Krugman presented a logical and sensational flow of his opinion on what \\"really\\" happened in Asia, before and after the 97 Asian Crisis, with good comparison to financial crisis in the 21st century including the Great Depression and the Tequilla Crisis. On the other hand, he had been humble enough to tell you that he did not know all the truth (Krugman even confessed that a Harvard professor had \\"seen\\" something Krugman himself had missed}. However, I can tell, as one of the hundreds of millions of Asian sufferers, and is still suffering under Tung Chee Wah's worse than stupid governance in Hong Kong, Krugman knew much more than those western economists sitting in glass houses (IMF) and the HK government, who had made the worst of everything.<br /><br />A must read for any true economists and philosophers, who acknowledges one's ignorance and would like to learn from the humble and talented.	2001-08-23

A self claimed successful trader and reviewer just gave only \\"one\\" star to the book because he found one of the interviewees a liar and that the author had failed to verify the history of his interviewees.<br /><br />Discounting the above, and taking in account that the book focused on the minds of options and futures traders (vs the all walks of life type in Market Wizards I&II), the primary objective had been delivered. In short, discipline, cut loss short, let profit run had been quoted in all the interviews, though in different styles and wordings. The book is well written by the ex barrister author, who intelligently and vividly merged his opinion with those of the interviewees, without going through the common Q&A format.<br /><br />You may like or dislike the book after reading it.

This is a good book. Concise, intelligent, and to the point:- no matter what skill/knowledge you have, all you need to do for long term success is to beat your ego, or in zen terms, forget and get rid of your own \\"self\\".<br /><br />I believe Mr. Toppel really knows zen. He quoted excellent zen sayings in his book. However, I really doubt how many westerners can understand the true meaning of \\"When I eat, I eat. When I walk, I walk. When I sleep, I sleep.\\" As subtly expressed in the suggested reading, this book needs to be read together with other zen readings for maxi impact.<br /><br />Finally, to justify my rating of this book, I would like to raise the following complaint: Mr. Toppel quoted six rules for all successful investors and traders. 1. Never add to a loser. 2. Add to a winner only. 3. Let profits run. 4. Cut losses fast. 5. Dont pick tops. 6. Dont pick bottoms.  And most important of all: 7. Let the market make the decisions, not your ego. However, one can find in no where Mr. Toppel had taught his readers how to spot the non-tops and non-bottoms.<br /><br />p.s.

Theoretically, if more people had known and read this book, much fewer would got \\"drown\\" in the internet bubble. However, when the Greater Fool theory was in full throttle, as prescribed by this book, that made no difference.<br /><br />Basically this book had covered all the financial catastrophes of the past 5 centuries: Tulipomania, South Sea Bubble, Fool's Gold, Railway mania, Great Depression, Japanese Bubble Economy blah blah blah. You name it. The most valuable thing being that the author had not just given an exhaustive account of what happened, but some reasoning why things repeated themselves, and how. Say, the government officials were corrupted, there came a so called technology innovation or a new market (the terms \\"New Era/Never coming back of the business cycle\\" were also there in 1929), the Greater Fool Theory in full gear, all the simple things you can tell from hindsight.<br /><br />As a CFA charterholder, I strongly recommend AIMR to put this book into the required reading list to warn its members of the limitation of the financial techniques/theories/calculations we try to preach.

When I saw \\"winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix?	2001-01-12

Definitely entertaining, but not impressive or insightful on any single topic that one may easily forget what he/she had just read a day or two before. However, it can be a good gift to your friend or colleague in case he/she just got a losing streak: Even the champion trader had taken nine years before he could make a living solely trading on his own.	2001-01-07

I simply bought it for its so &#34;affordable&#34; price. The fact is: I had been absolutely wrong. The author, a psychologist, really put something solid behind his propositions and recommendations. There are many books about why tips kill. The author really went into the very depth of our minds in layman psychology terms to explore why we kept on doing stupid things. As a pseudo intellect (ha ha), I bought his concept and that's the very beginning of my new professional trading life (avoiding any form of tipsters and tips). For those who are suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder on &#34;tips&#34;, it might help you a lot to stop your tips induced losing streak!	2001-01-07

Thanks to him, I got much insightful opinion of what went wrong in Asia starting summer 97 in Thailand which later smashed the entire Asia except perhaps PRC and Taiwan. As a professional spot and futures trader, I seldom trade derivatives. After reading the book, I become more skeptical of placing any bet on that, especially through Morgan Stanley, ha ha. Anyway, Fiasco is the kind of book you cannot miss, if you are a serious investor. BTW, I do feel very sorry for those who admire the big names (like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs) so much. They are doomed! I mean the investors, of course.	2001-01-07
US	46348524	RBSR6APL70CXM	0140143459	488185202	Liar's Poker: Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street	Books	5	8	10	N	N	First of its kind. Best of its kind. (for 8/90's and 21st .	You can neglect all the reviews and go straightly to any local bookstore to read the first chapter which describes the game \\"Liar's Poker\\". You will buy it then, I bet. It's not a trading book which I had expected, but a true story told by a bond salesman in Salomon Brothers about how bankers \\"stole\\" or sometimes \\"robbed\\" investors shamelessly. Though I still found two chapters quite boring, the rest are really interesting. Even you may not like the story, you will learn to be more careful when your private or personal banker calls you for a deal or two! Finally, I must agree with Management Today's comment that it \\"Should be made a legally required component of every MBA course\\".	2001-01-07

This book had answered some, but not all, questions you might ask whilst reading ROSO. Copied from Zweig, one must finish both before working/fighting with me.	2000-12-17

This book takes you to anywhere but successful investment and trading. I don't understand why some reviewers wrote it's a must read for traders or investors. Quite the opposite, as a professional trader, I would sell this book short.	2000-12-17
