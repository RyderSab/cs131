Bonnie Harris knows what you?re going through. You will recognize yourself here.<br />Here's the gist: By looking through your child's annoying behaviors to their underlying agendas and being aware of your own emotional hang-ups, you can avoid that ineffective state Harris calls \\"the road rage of parenting.\\" That's an extreme example of button-pushing, which is when your response is automatic, not well thought out, and usually regrettable. <BR> <BR>The book contains a wealth of suggestions for defusing your buttons (which could help you not just with your kids, but with everyone else in your life). There?s the Approval Button, the Fix-It Button, the Resentment Button?. Once you understand your baggage, you can stop taking your child?s antics personally. You still hold her accountable and set limits, but you also own up to your own emotional responses. Do not make your child responsible for YOUR feelings. (Even if this was done to you by your parents.)<br />Kids don't articulate their agendas, but they have them just like we do. You see a child playing with trains. What you don't realize is that the child is directing traffic and the toy milkman has to get the pretend milk delivered before lunchtime! So give him a couple minutes' warning before you make him leave the toys. Stop and think what your child is really up to in his own mind, rather than just what you see on the surface and what it does to YOU. Cut some slack when you can. When you can't, be nice about it.<br />It's about \\"finding a place in the middle, a balance where both you and your child are respected and understood.\\" (p. 226)<br />The book is not short and has lots of examples, only some of which will really resonate with you ? but it's worth a read to find those and for the general ideas. Including, \\"You are not perfect, nor should you be.\\"It's written clearly and organized well. (My only gripe is that the parents quoted in the workshops say things like \\"Oh! I think I'm beginning to see!\\" which I've never heard anyone really say. Don?t let that put you off.)<br />I have had been a calmer, cooler, more collected parent since reading it.<br />Book also contains worksheets and some really cool cartoons by Marty Kelly...	2003-07-19

Addiction is a problem that afflicts all kinds of people.<br />Looks at what drives each individual person to drink/gamble/whatever. Anger at unrealized helplessness is a key, but the specifics vary from person to person.<br />Each episode is a choice, but largely an unconscious choice, so in essence no choice.<br />Understanding what happens at that moment the person decides to go ahead with the addictive act is what allows him or her to develop other choices.	2002-04-28

Piglet is scared of Halloween so he builds himself a &quot;spookable,&quot; a mechanical monster, to test his own mettle.  He figures if he can handle he spookable he'll be able to handle whatever Halloween brings.  The spookable is a scary-looking contraption.

This is one book they like to look at -- they eagerly reach for the flap on each page and lift it, and help turn the  pages (it's a board book so that's easy).  It's not one of those books with  complex contraptions -- wheels to turn, tabs to pull and push and misguide.   Just simple flaps to lift up and put back down.  Strongly recommended as a  very first really-sit-down-and-read-it book.  Similar to &quot;Where's  Maisy?&quot; and that family of lift-the-flap books.  Good to read to kids  less than one year old.	2000-07-25

Then read  this if you want, but know that WAE is better.  WAE is an engaging and warm read; its sequel, Diller, is okay but a little  weaker and more forgettable.  <br />WAE centers on a lovable, interesting,  cozy old woman and her community; Diller centers on a lovable delinquent  young man and his community.  (The two characters are in both books.  Their  worlds intersect.)  WAE made more of an impression on me, but this one is  not a bad story to while away some hours with.	2000-06-16

Some are deeper, about things like father-daughter relationships. The sudden change from one flavor of essay to another can be jarring, but the essays don't suffer for that, just the book as a whole. Some are combinations, like \\"Music Lessons\\", about \\"lessons accidentally learned while pursuing music.\\" The pieces are probably best suited to radio, one at a time during a commute. In book form, they don't achieve full potential. You're not forced to read them in quick succession, but the book format pulls you to do so, and the points that make you laugh and nod are forgotten too quickly. A few of these essays (New Jersey, Chicago and Frank Sinatra) feel like too many words saying too little. But there are some gems of observation.	2000-06-05

Anything he liked has to be worth a look, I figure. Drabble has a Peanutsian tone, with simple, unoffensive gags. Had I not made the mental connection with Peanuts, I might have written Drabble off as corny and uninspiring. Once I realized it's not TRYING to be as edgy as most comics try to be, I liked it better for what it is. I suspect Drabble is most enjoyable in the newspaper, served up one strip a day. Somehow the simplicity of each gag works best that way. Note: The lettering style is sometimes hard to read.	2000-05-30

Moore nicely lays out diverse plot threads and brings them together. The reader's job is to stay focused until the threads merge. <br />I prefer Moore's \\"Love Nun\\" and \\"Lust Lizard.\\" They're more complex, with more depth to characters and landscape, and more fun. \\"Demonkeeping\\" is a decent lightweight read but don't go out of your way for it.	2000-05-30

The combination of high-tech futuristic sci-fi and historical period fiction grabbed me.   Halfway through the book I realized that the sci-fi had mostly given way to the historical part (though the  sci-fi premise is integral) and in fact for several chapters nothing much  happened...  and yet for some reason I  remained absorbed in the book.  It  reminds me of reading Agatha Christies, where the  storytelling engages you  and what differs from book to book is just the setting.	2000-05-29

You can leave it on your shelf or by your bed, and pick it up from  time to time, open it to somewhere, and find solace and wisdom.  No matter where you start  reading, you'll find you've read  half a chapter before you know it, even when you only meant  to look up one  specific little thing.  This woman writes like a charm.<br />I think it's a  bonus if you've heard her speak, because you can hear her speaking what's   written here, and her delivery is just wonderful.  Quite erudite and  thoroughly knowledgeable  but not even a molecule of pretense.  Reading  this book gives you the utmost respect for its  author, and makes you want  to invite her over for lunch as well.<br />You'll pick it up and read, and  then you'll go away from it and go about your busy life.  You'll  get lost  again in diapers or laundry or the ins and outs of your baby's psyche.   You'll get  worn, or angry.  At some point if you remember to dip into the  book again, Penelope will  remind you where the ground is and where your  center is, and you will go be a good parent  some more.<br />Penelope Leach is  a Ph.D. psychologist -- she knows her child development.  Throughout,  she  discusses WHY we should do X or Y as parents, and she explains the  capacities and  limitations of children at each age -- and their  experiences, as well as can be known.  This is  a book absolutely grounded  in the best of research.  It's really an education in child   development.<br />There are very few better, clearer, writers than Penelope  Leach, either.<br />I imagine there are a lot of parents out there who are at  least a little better than they would  have been, as parents, for reading  this book.<br />If you have the slightest chance, get it and read it.  If you  are even considering this as a gift to new parents, it'd be a terrific one.	2000-05-28

It would make a better  Conclusion -- too abstract to follow if you don't already have some factual underpinnings.<br />On to the rest of the book.   Chapter 2 is sort of an overview.  Remaining chapters cover  &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Careers&quot;, &quot;Distinctions&quot;  (about social status), &quot;Intimate Relations&quot;, &quot;Reform&quot;  (religious and moral), and &quot;A New National Identity&quot;.  The  material is undeniably interesting -- dueling newspaper editors (and  dueling everyone else), downtrodden young people finding their way,  cultural battles between north and south, Federalists vs. republicans, the  inception of careers and jobs that had not existed before... and did you  know that separate right and left shoes were an invention of this recent  time period?  Where Appleby stocks the book with primary material, it's  engaging.  Where she talks in generalities, there are way too many  sentences that have to be read several times to sink in.  &quot;The intense  politicization of public life from political and institutional  controversies accustomed Americans to public disclosure.&quot;  (p. 41)  Is  this circular, or what? I imagine the book is most difficult for those  unfamiliar with the material, a little easier for those who have some  background. <br />One other complaint:  The reader is often left to wonder how  things got to be as Appleby describes.  For instance:  &quot;Jefferson and  his supporters democratized American politics... by implementing  policies  that enabled people to work out the terms of their lives with minimal  interference  from family, church, or state.&quot;  What policies?  Not one  example is given; there's nothing for  the reader to grip.  I'm intrigued  by the statement but I'm left hanging.<br />On the whole, it's a worthwhile  bunch of material, and the style is sometimes engaging.  Just be prepared  to deal with the passages that are less engaging.	2000-05-22

Also be forewarned that it's written at maybe a sixth-grade reading level.  (Neither of these is necessarily a bad thing.) <br />It's a simplistic and lengthy testimonial.  There are some reconstructed dialogues that feel  artificial, some of the chronology is hard to follow, and people appear out of nowhere or disappear after being identified in detail.  <br />The first 82 pages are mainly football, with lots of numbers and stats. There's an entire chapter on his sausage business that reads like a promotional pamphlet:  \\"All of our meals are precooked and  specially sealed with a newly developed technology to keep them fresh. Customers only have to pop them into a microwave oven for three minutes before serving. These meals have become big sellers for us because they  are convenient and taste great\\" etc. (p. 153). And not only that, but \\"Today I feel as confident about my ability to make a great-tasting meat product as I used to feel about my ability to run with the football. I think both are God-given talents\\" (p. 153). There's nothing to tie this to the supposed theme of the book.<br />We get glimpses of Campbell's \\"pride\\" (anger at a doctor's suggestion that he try Prozac, sudden disgust with one who asks him to ingest caffeine as an experiment, lashing out at doctors who, attempting to arrive at a diagnosis, inquire whether he uses drugs), glimpses of his warm feelings, and mere hints at \\"fear of failure\\" and an \\"emotional man\\". Just when he starts to tell us something interesting, he quits and moves on.  <br />You get the feeling this guy wants to talk about it but he doesn't want to talk about it. <br />This is also hinted at by some contradictions. In one chapter he can't attend banquets because crowds bother him, but a few pages later he says \\"My panic disorder has no effect on my ability to function in the business world\\" (p. 149). If these are both true, some discussion would help. <br />Many panic sufferers would like to wave this book around as evidence that panic  does not equate with general wimpiness.  It's just disappointing that more substance isn't given here.	2000-05-14

Lerner has a remarkable facility for expressing the heart of the matter. Yes, maybe the typology of writers is overgeneralized. But the types in this book (The Ambivalent Writer, The Natural, The Wicked  Child, The Self-Promoter, The Neurotic, and the one Touching Fire) are caricatures, almost, based on large kernels of truth and delivered in frankness and good humor. Most writers and aspiring writers will fit parts of each category. It's a vehicle to provoke self-examination.	2000-05-02

There's a popular guy in school she pines for, who barely knows she exists. She gets along with her parents.

Sometimes the time spent on one plotline before switching to the other is too short. Some characters feel underdeveloped, the ending stretches on too long, and there are scattered typos that contribute to a feeling the book was rushed. Finally, there's some overuse of clever similes. In the span of a few pages we get \\"Snowy went and drank from the tiny pool with a noise like an inefficient suction pump trying to deal with an unlucky turtle\\", \\"When he awoke, it was to a sound very much like a donkey being sawn in half\\", \\"The sound was that of a straw investigating the suds of the biggest milkshake in the world\\", and then some. Too much of this takes the laugh out of it.<BR>But I still recommend the book for its humor and cleverness.   \\"'We're wizards, young man. Using magic is what wizarding is all about.'

It's incoherent.  <br />In one semester (sometimes two) a student is asked to absorb ... all of psychology.  Each chapter in a typical Intro Psych text  represents a course in itself.  And... it's incoherent.<br />There's no  *simple* way to divide psychology into manageable units.  You can  categorize it by topic -- some psychologists study mental disorders, some  study sensation and perception, some study conditioning, and so on -- or  you can divide it by theoretical allegiance -- some psychologists are  behaviorists, some adhere to a biological approach, some to a psychodynamic  approach, and so on.  <br />Whichever way you categorize, you have messy  boundaries.  Worse, the interaction between topic and theoretical approach  is blurry -- not a nice two-by-two table you could build.  Sometimes the  topic IS the theoretical approach.  Sometimes not.<br />Tavris and Wade have  contributed one of the few -- in fact the only one I've seen -- textbooks  to categorize material by theoretical perspective, not by topic of inquiry.   They've done a good job of it.  The advantage to organizing this way is  better flow between sections of the book. Tavris and Wade's writing also  flows nicely -- the book is fairly readable, as these things go, and feels  a little less technical than traditional books (though it really isn't).   This is a plus for many students.  If the organization by theoretical  perspective makes sense to you, this is your book.  It will appeal to  students who already are thinking this way, and it will be a good  introduction to higher levels of abstraction for students who are stuck in  concrete.<br />There's no perfect intro psych text yet.  This one is a good  choice.	2000-04-17

You'll appreciatethis strip for mirroring the ways in which your family makes you nuts, the ways in which your family makes you smile, and the ways in which your family and other people's families really make you wonder.<br />The specifics of the characters' bios matter less than their wit.  For instance: There's a toddler boy here named Max -- but his humor is for everyone, not just toddlers and parents.  We all have our inner toddler, and we all know people who act like toddlers, and these strips are just plain funny, no matter where you're coming from.  That holds for the other Stone Soup characters too.  <br />This is a strip that winds up passed around among friends, pasted on the fridge, and re-read many times.

This book is really skimpy.  I'm sorry, Joy, I do like your humor as it comes across on the tube, and I really like your style when it comes to discussing Hot Topics or whatever on The View.  I even admire some things  I've heard you say.  I was just disappointed in the book.<br />This sure feels  to me like the obligatory publish-it-while-you're-hot-and-scoop-a-few-bucks  &quot;humor&quot; book.  It's empty.  (I blame the author's agent or some  other advice-giver.)  It takes maybe an hour to read and at the end you  think, I kept reading waiting for the good stuff and now I've fallen off  the end of the book and never found the good stuff.  It sorta reads like  you dropped your index cards full of one-liners for standup, and they got  scrambled up, and you picked 'em up and started reciting them one after the  other anyway.  A lot of it's half-baked, not fleshed out enough.  Needs a  lot more editing and time put into it.  Get rid of some parts, flesh out  some others.<br />I found the biographical bits, the part about the grad  student husband and the parts about therapy, worth the read.  But not the  rest.  Joy is best at sarcasm, off-the-cuff wit, and comebacks -- stuff  which requires context, and live action, and just don't work in a book like  this.  Maybe she could write a good novel, but this kind of collection  falls flat, to me.  <br />It would be a shame for someone to read this book  and have that be their only impression of Joy Behar's humor.  She's much  better in motion.	2000-04-15

Someone below called this a feminist comic strip but I think that's misleading, especially given the current difficulties in just defining that word.  Yes, it happens to have several female characters, and yes it's not  a stereotypical mom-dad-dog-2.4-kids-wagon-picket-fence family, BUT: This  strip is about all of us, everyone of every sex and age and family style,  and it's enjoyable to (and enjoyed by) a wide range of people -- even  ordinary traditional people and even (gasp) men!  My husband loves it, my  60-something dad loves it, and so on.  I think the publisher's blurb on the  back of the second Stone Soup collection (&quot;You Can't Say Boobs On  Sunday&quot;) got it right:  &quot;Anyone who's ever had a family, been in  a family, or known a family seems to love Stone Soup. ... Readers see  themselves and their families in Stone Soup, and they love it.&quot;  That  goes for people who don't consider themselves family-oriented, and for  people who do.<br />Everyone I've known who's read any Stone Soup has enjoyed  it and wound up quoting or passing around some of the strips.<br />Recommended  reading for everyone except total grumps, I say.	2000-04-14

Not particularly thought-provoking. I found it tedious at times, pointlessly dark and depressing, and lacking in vividness -- I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who mentioned the dull writing style that doesn't give a good picture. If this book is gripping it's largely because of what the reader brings to it, which is fine, but not every reader will find it the greatest book ever written. <br />I bought it on the strength of the reviews and expected to like it. The first third was alright but eventually I gave in to my disappointment. It didn't contain a message I don't already know, and it didn't pack a punch.  <br />Maybe the reviewer who said \\"Will disappoint mature readers\\" had a point -- this is not an insult to those who loved it, but a comment on the age of those who didn't. Maybe the themes are fairly good ones that some of us have encountered elsewhere before. There are other books about too-smart kids, kids under pressure, individuals who feel isolated, etc. And there are other tremendously engaging or thoughtful sci-fi books. Asimov's Robots and Empire series, The Gods Themselves, David Brin's Earth, John Brunner's Shockwave Rider etc. Which ones you find engaging will depend partly on you.	2000-04-13

What sets this apart from other breastfeeding books is<br />1.  It has a readable, friendly presentation.<br />2.  It combines solid information with emotional support (lighthearted, not sappy).  There's more to breastfeeding (to DOING it) than you think, and it's explained here.<br />3.  It's short  enough not to overwhelm.  You're too busy/tired to read encyclopedias.   <br />4. It imparts technical facts AND practical advice from people who've  been there.  <br />My complaints with the book are outweighed by the good  things I got out of it, but here they are:<br />1.  Occasionally I picked up a  hint of near bashing of non-breastfeeders, as in  &quot;Breastfeeding  represents a style of parenting:  Right off the bat you're willing to  adjust your life to your baby's and give a lot of love.  You might save  your child a lot of time and money he'd have spent in therapy&quot; (p.  28).  Not only is this statement silly and of questionable purpose, it's a  backwards argument.  You don't breastfeed to prove you have a certain  parenting style.  You start with the style, and then you breastfeed.   Tamaro seems to be arguing that you should breastfeed because it will mean  you have a good parenting style.  I consider this complaint minor because  the rest of the book doesn't carry this tone.<br />2.  Too little info about  sources of some claims.  &quot;Did you know a study in Sweden showed  that...?&quot; is insufficient.  &quot;Breastfed babies have better  eyesight&quot; (p. 29) is insufficient.  I want a few details and a  citation .  I know I said above I was glad this book is NOT an  encyclopedia, but I'm talking about the addition of just a few words here.   Overall, though, the book seems credible.  Can't argue with the  personal-experience bits.<br />3.  The fact that the ingredients in baby  formula have long gibberish-like names does NOT imply they're bad.  The  chemical name for ANYTHING can sound bad.  And on the flip side:  the fact  that something's natural does not alone imply that it's good for you.   There are natural poisons.  So get rid of the part about the ucky-sounding  ingredients in formula and &quot;is THAT what you want to feed your  baby?&quot; I agree that formula is inferior to breast milk.  But the names  of the ingredients have nothing to do with it.<br />Conclusion:  I strongly  recommend this book to anyone considering breastfeeding and to anyone who's  already started.  You can read it quickly even while you're tired and  you'll learn some things.  You may want to read some others too, but start  with this one.	2000-04-11

I'm a particular Blandings Castle fan -- they're my favorite Wodehouse -- so I was a little disappointed in this  one.  But, hey, there ARE six fairly good Blandings Castle stories here.   Then again, I recommend the novels over the short stories; they're much  more fun and engaging.  The stories are like eating one M&amp;M and not  having any more in the bag.  Not enough THERE there.  The novels have more  time for P.G. to do what he's best at -- weaving tangled plot lines and  setting up slapstick.	2000-04-11

Shaffer is not intent on making an in-depth astronomer out of everyone (although if that's what you're bound for, this book will be a  fine first leg up).  His presentation is clear and friendly, good for  browsing, for reference, or for reading straight through.  Use it however  suits you.<br />The first three chapters cover basics -- longitude and  latitude and why they matter; how to read sky maps; paths of the sun, moon,  and planets; basic terms; how telescopes work; etc.  These might sound like  intimidating topics but they're covered in just enough depth and not a bit  more (e.g. &quot;A Very Short Primer on Light&quot;).<br />A nice feature is  on page two, a section titled &quot;If You're in a BIG Hurry, What to Read  First&quot; (i.e. what parts of this book).<br />After discussion of  telescopes, including how to choose one and what to do with it, there are  five chapters on sky-watching.  First there's the close stuff:  artificial  satellites, the moon... and then there's the farther away stuff:  planets,  stars, nebulas, groups of galaxies.<br />There's a sky map for each month; the  maps are easy to read.  Beginner that I was, with this book I was able to  identify a few stars I'd noticed several nights in a row -- turned out to  be one side of Orion.  The fact that what I saw in the sky was recognizable  on the map here is a big plus.<br />This is a book that will last you long  past the very-beginner stage.	2000-04-11

Rosenfeld talks  about what is known to work, what might work, and what probably won't work  even if you thought it would.  <br />Straightforward, not comprehensive, but  clear in what it does cover.

By looking through this book I learned that, as I hoped, I am perfectly capable of removing one  sink faucet and installing a new one.  And I knew nothing about it beforehand.  (Haven't done it yet, but I now know what's  involved.)  I know what tools I'll need (not too many) -- and now I know  the names of some tools I didn't used to know.  I know what the basic parts  of a faucet are and how they work together -- and it didn't take me more  than 10 minutes of reading and thinking to grasp it all.  <br />The diagrams  are excellent -- extremely clear, complete, well labeled.  Every so often  there's an &quot;Expert's Insight&quot; -- a little helpful hint, or trick  of the trade for making things easier.  For each task the book clearly  identifies how much time you should budget, what tools you'll need, and  what skill level you'll need to start with.  e.g., for fixing leaky toilet  tanks and bowls, &quot;No special skills, but be careful not to crack the  toilet.&quot;  How straightforward can you get?

I've seen others with more engaging artwork, and I'm not fond of the typeface used here -- it looks kind of like ordinary typewriter print pasted into a nice book.

It's disjointed and repetitive, thus boring. Where other TPs contain several story threads each entertaining in its own right, Interesting Times seems to have a few storylines whose relationship is muddled. The vividness of the other novels (distinctive names, smell and texture of The River Ankh, etc.) is lacking in this one. Interesting Times is just a political hammer over the reader's head. Not enough creativity here.<br />Interesting Times is not up to the standards of Wyrd Sisters, Lords and Ladies, Equal Rites, Feet of Clay, and others.	2000-04-08

It's a handy little volume, with a several-page introduction providing historical context, and a several-page  calendar of British and American poetry from 1750 to around 1850.  The  calendar doesn't just list poetry, it includes events like &quot;Watt's  steam engine patented&quot; and &quot;Lewis and Clark Expedition&quot; as  well as the publication of novels and music, so context is well  established.  At the back of the book is an index of poems by title and by  first line, and there's a set of biographical notes on the poets.<br />If you  want to know what romantic poetry's all about, take a look at this.  I  don't know how an English Lit Ph.D. would rate this book but I think it's a  nice collection.	2000-04-08

No one else's  novels in this genre are as readable or as real.  In fact, few novelists in any genre do such a good of engaging the  reader.  It's not flashy, it's not gimmicky, it's just good writing.  It's  you-are-there and you want to gobble it up.  And in the process you feed  your mind.  What a deal.<br />I recommend all Roberts' novels.  This one  concerns the Battle of Valcour and related events during the revolutionary  war -- told from a completely personal perspective.  By the time you're  done this book you'll not only understand the military maneuvers, you'll  empathize with the cold toes and fatigue (and more) of the people  maneuvering.  A highlight of Rabble in Arms is its presentation of more  about Benedict Arnold than most people know.  He's not just a caricature,  he's a real guy, and here is what's behind his scenes.<br />Buy it, read it!   Excellent book.	2000-04-08

But some of the pieces ARE funny -- with some gay-specific humor (which  isn't to say only gay people get it, just that it's topical) and some more  general humorous looks at life.  On balance I'd say it's about 50-50 funny  and not.  It's something you can skim through and get a few laughs out of  in the course of a day.

Here are the chapter titles, to give you a more specific idea: Guiding Themes in Human Development; The Infant; Connectedness; Establishing a Morality; The  Emotions; The Generation of Thought; The Role of the Family.<br />Kagan is  known for his work on temperamental shyness in infants.  In this highly  theoretical work (supported by evidence in many cases, but of course we  don't know what counterevidence is going unmentioned) he critiques several  generally accepted premises about psychological development. He argues that  there is NOT a strong connectedness between the qualities a person has at  early stages of development and the qualities he or she has at much later  stages.  He argues for the primacy of emotion over logic in our  development.  He notes in the preface that &quot;It is not what parents do  to children or siblings do to each other that matters, but rather the  intention the child imputes to those who act on and with him or  her.&quot;<br />Thought-provoking stuff even for us ordinary parents, not just  professionals and academics, although the writing style is at times a  little over the top.  If you can tease out the point Kagan makes within  each long paragraph, you'll find it worth discussing.	2000-04-04

I got excited by the subtitle (Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Mixed Anxiety-Depression) because the anxiety-depression connection  receives too little attention in the literature, but I was disappointed  that there wasn't more here.<br />When I see a chapter titled &quot;The  Biology of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Chronic Anxiety&quot;, I expect  ... well, whole books could be written on that.  Maybe the problem is in  the title.  The articles skim the surface and leave me frustrated.  Of what  good, really, is it to know only that  &quot;neurotransmitters of potential  significance in anxiety disorders include ... (NMDA) receptors and ...  (CRF).  Selective antagonists of the excitatory NMDA receptors have been  shown in animal models to have antiepileptic, muscle relasxant, and  anxiolytic properties [reference given]&quot; (p. 65).  And then, after  some detail on CRF, the chapter leaves off neurotransmitters and moves on  to metabolism.  The fact that it said neurotransmitters of interest  *include* these two implies there are others.  WHAT ARE THEY?  And the   single sentence covering NMDA is too little when a book is written  narrative-style like this.  Either leave it out or give me a little more  substance.  As it is, the chapter reads like it can't decide whether to be  a narrative or a list of things to memorize for an exam.<br />I found similar  difficulties with other chapters.<br />I don't mean that there's nothing of  value here, just that you'll wind up needing to go to other books and  articles anyway, so...?  You'd probably run into, for instance, the work on  NMDA elsewhere if you just did the literature review yourself.  This book  doesn't add anything to that.	2000-04-04

Some  leap to the conclusion that alcoholics and other &quot;addicts&quot; have  no personal control whatsoever over their behavior.  Some leap to the  conclusion that of course they do.  Peele mostly avoids leaping to  conclusions, but if he leaps it's toward the latter of those two.<br />Here's  what I think the truth is, and Peele would agree: When we say that someone  is addicted, we have not explained their behavior.  Many people in our  society think that the word &quot;addiction&quot; contains an explanation  for behavior. &quot;Addiction&quot; is a *description* of behavior.  It is  also -- and I'm not sure what Peele would say about this -- a description  of biological processes. What's important is how to get the behavior, and  any negative emotions along with it (depression, etc.), to change.  How can  we best do this? Peele argues that we cannot do it with medical treatment.  This may be true in many cases.  I think medical treatment can be of  assistance in some cases.   What I find missing from Peele is more about  what DOES work to help someone stop smoking, drinking, etc.  What  distinguishes those who quit from those who don't?  A circular answer here  won't cut it.  If you say &quot;in order to quit, you've gotta have  determination and willpower&quot;, then I'll say &quot;how do you know if  someone has determination and willpower?&quot;, and you'll say  &quot;because he quit smoking.&quot;  Thud.  Where does a person GET  willpower and determination?  Maybe not from medicine.  But not from  nowhere.  (?)  I agree that personal responsibility needs to be at the  forefront.  I agree that the addictive model is a little confused about  personal control.  But Peele doesn'thave all the answers, either. It's a  well written book, though, and worth reading just to provoke thought and  debate.	2000-04-04

I can handle complex.  Douglas Hofstadter talks about complex things, but I can understand him.  I can remember what he wrote.  And if I can understand Hofstadter, I must have SOME reading abilities.  But this  book of Calvin's I found forgettable, because his sentences and paragraphs  and topics wander too much.  And I like this stuff, the topic, that is.  I  eat this stuff up, books about consciousness and neuropsychology and  psychology in general.  But this... I read a few years ago, found it  slippery at the time, and can barely remember what I got out of it. Here's  a sample:  &quot;Consciousness is a very overused word, the same string of  syllables being used to designate a multitide of meanings.  It's much worse  than the multiple meanings of brain, which, besides denoting the three  pounds of nerve cells inside our heads, is also used as a verb (to club,  aiming at a head), as the opposite of brawn, as a surname in England, as a  term for a studious student or the chief planner of an enterprise, and more  recently to designate something as inanimate as a computer.  Being a  neurophsyiologist, I tend to avoid the nonneurological uses of the word  [WHICH ONE?], but I doubt that I'll convert the rest of the  Englsih-speaking world to my more restrictive usage&quot; (p.75).  <br />And  trust me, it gets worse in the next few sentences.  Redundant.  90% of that  first sentence above is tangent.  By the time I get to the end I don't  remember what the subject was.  This guy likes to hear himself talk.  I  don't mean that personally, maybe he's a great guy, I don't know, but I  think he needs some help with the writing style.  And it wouldn't be so bad  if he eventually got to some point about consciousness or psychology, but  sometimes I can't find why all that tangent was there.<br />I can't (or won't)  critique what the book is about; I think the writing style overrides it.   (The type it's set in didn't help, either.  Sounds like quibbling but it's  true.  Somehow it added to the muddiness.  Too squished, maybe.  I think  the quoted sentence reads more clearly as I've typed it here than when one  reads it on paper in the book.)	2000-04-03

Gazzaniga conducted some of the first research on split-brain phenomenon, from which popular culture got the whole left brain - right brain thing.  If you are interested in that and think you know what it's all about, take the time to read this short explanation of how the research was conducted  and what the author himself makes of it.  It's really worthwhile.  There  are a great many misconceptions and overgeneralizations out there about  left/right-brain issues.  Gazzaniga debunks some of those and offers his  own conclusions -- just as fascinating as the usual pop stuff, but better  grounded in reality.<br />Gazzaniga argues that our brain is a conglomerate  where several processes go on separately, and he then asks (and ventures an  answer) how we manage to perceive just a single unified experience for  ourselves.	2000-04-03

This collection of columns was published the year after she won a Pulitzer (in 1980).  Her material is family life, relationships, and some politics and general social commentary.  The columns here are grouped under headings like &quot;Women  in the Age of Transition&quot;, &quot;The Hard Questions&quot;, and  &quot;Our Daughters, Our Sons&quot;.  She's a fairly good writer, sometimes  a little repetitive and less incisive than I think she could be.  The  obvious feature of this book is that it's 20 years old, so its columns  about Kramer Vs. Kramer, John Lennon, Anita Bryant, passive smoking, and  dietary fads can't be read the same way you'd read current columns.  On the  other hand, a lot hasn't changed in the social arena since 1981 -- men and  women, communication, parents and children....  You can read this with  nostalgia or not.

You get a little  feeling this way for what the stories meant to him.  And, of course,  they're great stories.  Did he write any bad ones ever?  I don't think so.

Maybe he's right, but how do we know?  &quot;...in the deep unconscious system, once a person is a social acquaintance, he or she can *never* be a therapist to that individual.  A therapist who attempts to cross that boundary is universallly seen in the deep unconscious system as  incestuous&quot; (p. 82).  Maybe so.  But what's the evidence?  (And not  only that, but what qualifies as a &quot;social acquaintance&quot;?)  Just  exactly how did Langs identify with certainty the &quot;deep  unconscious&quot; system -- universally, no less? <br />The book is almost  three hundred pages like this, and my response is the same throughout.  I  like a lot of the ideas here.  Some I don't like so much.  Langs might  argue about why I don't like them, or what I &quot;really&quot; feel, or  which level of me wants what.  OK.  I'm willing to entertain some notions  about that, but what's the point of asserting things that are immune to  examination and refutation?  It kind of makes the whole thing just a  fantasy.<br />I don't think this book alone is enough to help someone really  rate his or her psychotherapist.  I do, however, recommend it above  superficial popular magazine rating scales.  And I think people in therapy  SHOULD think about these things.	2000-04-03

But that's not really saying much.<br />A student who's not math-phobic will enjoy it.   It's not one of those statistics texts that tries to give just the concepts and not the  underlying math.  This one goes for the math -- which is the foundation of  the concepts.  (Conceptual explanations in plain English are here too!  The  book is not pure math.  Anyway, statistics is equal parts numbers and  reasoning.)<br />The illustrations and diagrams are generally excellent.  Each  chapter ends with a large selection of questions and exercises (answers to  some of these are provided at the back of the book) and a bibliography for  further reading.  Yes, really useful further reading -- not just academic  texts, but popular science magazine articles, biographies of  mathematicians, etc.  <br />Notation and terms are boxed off within the text,  to be clearly noticeable upon review of the chapter.  Helpful for  studying.<br />Sample computer output is given frequently, which is a nice  bonus.  Sometimes the output of popular statistics software can seem  cryptic to the uninitiated.  This initiates people.  An appendix covers SAS  and SPSS usage for each topic in the textbook.<br />Of course it's up to the  reader (or instructor) to choose how much material to cover; you could  easily just ignore the last few chapters if you don't need the advanced  material.  But it's here, which makes this a nice book.  (You might want  the advanced material SOMEday...)<br />There are 17 chapters running from  &quot;Sampling and Measurement&quot;, &quot;Descriptive Statistics&quot;  and &quot;Probability Distributions&quot; through regression and  correlation, *multiple* regression and correlation, ANOVA, and on to  ANCOVA, &quot;Model Building with Multpile Regression&quot;, &quot;Logistic  Regression&quot;, and then a single chapter at the end which briefly talks  about the existence of factor analysis, structural equations, and other  &quot;Advanced Topics&quot;.<br />It's a well written and quite in-depth  textbook.

Here are *excerpts from* 50 fundamental articles in psychology -- from  Freud a century ago to researchers working a decade ago.  Any beginning  psychology student at the high school or undergraduate level would do well  to read them.  For that matter, any graduate student would do well to read  the ones that he or she isn't already familiar with -- the book covers the  gamut of specialties in psychology, pretty much following the topics that  are found in a standard intro psych textbook, and in the same order.  The  trouble is that too much editing -- that is, leaving out of things -- took  place here.  I realize this was done to make things accessible to  first-time readers who would be put off by statistics, methodological  discussions, or technical debates in journal articles.  Still I think these  excerpts could give students a false sense, or no sense, of what actual  research reports are like.  Better to give them the entire article and tell  them which sections to ignore.  Then they can see what (and how much)  they're missing.  They can handle it.	2000-04-02

The PDR family guide series is okay, but not the best.  <br />A set of color photographs of many prescription drugs is included, to help you identify what your pills ought to look like.<br />For each drug, the guide tells us the  brand name, generic name, reason for prescribing the drug, &quot;most  important fact about this drug&quot; (according to whom?), how it should be  taken, what side effects might occur, limitations and special warnings,  possible food and drug interactions, information about pregnancy and  breastfeeding, and recommended dosage.<br />One thing I think is lacking here  is an indication of which side effects we can safely ignore and which ones  we should monitor closely or report to a physician.<br />I'd also like some  indication of how likely each side effect is.  I've seen other books that  explain just what &quot;common&quot;, &quot;uncommon&quot;, etc. mean, in  statistical terms, and where the statistics came from.  That would be  helpful here.<br />In any case, this book is now outdated!  It's from 1993 and  not only are there plenty of new drugs since then (and maybe some that have  gone off the market?) but also the indications for some drugs have changed.   For instance, some antidepressants are now approved for the treatment of  problems other than depression; this book tells us that Zoloft is used to  treat depression and never mentions that Zoloft is used to treat  obsessive-compulsive disorders and other anxiety disorders.

The focus on resilience (&quot;protective factors&quot;) as well as risk is  a big plus.<br />Infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthood are all given  some attention here.  Topics taken up for analysis include depression,  divorce, maternal stress, and eating disorders.  It's a diverse collection  of articles all sharing one question:  when two people face the same  circumstances, why does this one develop psychopathology and this one not?   <br />Important reading.  A central book for those seriously interested in the  development of psychopathology.	2000-04-02

You can't do better than this to get an overview of S&amp;P. Good introductory or mid-level book. Starts with all the basics (how the ear works, how we see color) and winds up with complex topics like how we perceive music.<br />A good reference book, it's even fun for browsing, or for sharing with friends and saying &quot;This is so cool! Check this out!&quot; (regarding some of the perceptual illusions and demonstrations etc.) How many textbooks can you say that about?	2000-04-02

Pennebaker  -- preeminent scientist in the field -- provides an introductory overview.   Social (and other) psychologists will recognize the names of chapter  authors:  William B. Stiles (&quot;Is It Psychotherapeutic to  Disclose?&quot;), Daniel Wegner (&quot;From Secrecy to  Psychopathology&quot;), Thomos Borkovec (&quot;Disclosure and Worry&quot;),  and others.<br />This is a cutting-edge area in psychology and here is the  lowdown from the field.  Detailed descriptions of the experiments and  observational studies that have been done on the relationship between  self-disclosure (expressive writing, talking, etc.) and one's emotional and  physical health (as measured by self-report of symptoms, visits to health  clinic, cellular immune activity, etc.).  Here is what's really behind the  scenes of those superficial quotes you see in magazines these days that say  &quot;writing about your problems may make you healthier!&quot; <br />Highly  recommended.

Next comes Diagnosis, Motivation (the patient's), The  Therapist-Patient Relationship (focusing heavily on transference and  countertransference), and The Tools of Treatment (&quot;Listening&quot;,  &quot;Asking Questions&quot;, &quot;Interpretation&quot;, etc.).<br />It's  encouraging to see Weinberg's acknowledgement of &quot;The Therapist's  Personality&quot;.  (Ever met a therapist who wouldn't admit to having  one?)  <br />You may find it refreshing or you may find it disagreeable, but  Weinberg is one therapist-author who does not hesitate in the slightest to  state his own shoulds and should-nots.  He acknowledges that they're his  (&quot;I think...&quot;, &quot;...in my opinion&quot;), and that's what  this book is made of.  He does some surveying of common therapeutic  practice, but eventually states his own conclusions about how therapists  should behave. For instance:  &quot;An adult on his way from tennis should  not have to go all the way home to change if the therapist's office is near  the courts.  A shower ought to be enough, in my opinion&quot; (p. 28).   Once Weinberg gets past clothing and telephones and into things like  interpretation, advice-giving, and listening, we're on more typical ground  for books about therapy.  Still Weinberg presents his ways of doing things.   Agree or disagree; this might be an interesting book to provoke discussion  among therapists-in-training.  Or to provoke thought among therapy patients  -- whose own therapists might or might not agree with Weinberg's  assertions.  The book is most useful in those places where Weinberg  includes his rationale with his choices.	2000-04-01

This is a valuable thing for both  psychotherapists (in training or otherwise... and shouldn't  psychotherapists always be in training?) and their clients.<br />Havens  follows Freud and Sullivan but mentions them as much for their limitations  as for their accuracies.<br />The book provides intriguing insight into how  therapists think about therapy, how they go about creating a &quot;safe  psychological place&quot; for the people they work with.  Reads like a  novel (or series of stories) with thoughtful commentary interspersed.  The  reader comes away reassured that therapists are fallible, therapists have  questions, and therapists care.	2000-04-01
US	52920773	R3HTQWU0JAT9RY	0446353442	260809355	No More Fears	Books	1	11	13	N	N	Not credible	This is just a little weird. Some of what Hunt says is reputable and makes sense.  It's nice that he combines talking about psychological aspects of (and treatments for) anxiety with talking about drug- and food-related  aspects of (and treatments for) anxiety.  But he doesn't exactly interweave  them well.  A section about how to use behavioral techniques to conquer  shyness is followed, with no segue, by a list of vitamins and  gimmicky-sounding preparations to ingest.  It's not always clear whether  one is supposed to do the nutritional treatment first, the behavioral  treatment first, or both.  Since the nutritional treatment is often  supposed to completely cure the anxiety, why are the behavioral treatments  here?<br />Hunt's approach is just too glib, and quite vague.  There's almost  nothing here about WHY or HOW various vitamins and other  &quot;supplements&quot; fix one's anxiety.  Just take 'em because he says  so.  I'd like a little more discussion of why I should trust  this.<br />Mainly, I'm unnerved by his failure to explain how he arrived at  each particular combination of supplements for each particular disorder.   He does spend a little time discussing individual nutrients (calcium,  biotin, etc.) and what they seem to do in the body.<br />Hunt excoriates  modern anti-anxiety drugs except for short-term use because they can cause  side effects and be addictive.  So vitamins and herbs and whatnot never  have side effects?  Not to mention that Hunt does not address the possible  effects of taking all these things in combination (typically he prescribes  seven or eight different pills or powders for a given ailment).   <br />WHY is  the list of supplements for Fear of the Dentist different from the one for  Social Anxiety, which is yet different from the one for Stage Fright, and  so on?  Maybe there are good reasons, but why aren't they explained here?   The lack of explanation makes me suspicious.<br />I understand there is  probably research indicating that, say, biotin might help with anxiety in  some regard (I'm not sure how direct the evidence is).  Hunt provides an  impressive list of references in the back, of journal articles about these  supplements.  But he doesn't convince me that anyone has shown that this  particular combination of supplements is good for this particular type of  fear.  I don't believe it has been shown.<br />You'd be far better off to read  the original research articles yourself and form your own conclusions.	2000-04-01

It is about what counts as conclusive research and why. <br />The book comprises three parts:  Part A on Recent Philosophical  Developments (recent relatvie to 1987); Part B on Misunderstandings and  Misinferences; and Part C on the Evaluation of a Field of Theory and  Reseatch, in which Phillips takes his points from Parts A and B and applies  them to a particular field of social science -- people's cognitive  development -- for illustration.<br />Phillips describes his own theme as  &quot;a mild Popperianism and naturalism:  Knowledge progresses not by the  absolute establishment of conclusions, but by  the exposing of  conjectures... to criticism....  However, not even this process yields  certainty....  Progress follows a tentative and meandering course&quot; (p.  116).<br />He provides a good overview of main points in the philosophy of  science -- that is, &quot;the understanding of the nature of science&quot;  (p. 5) -- in the 20th century.  Researchers who are new to the idea of  &quot;philosophy of science&quot; and unfamiliar with the big names in the  field would do well to start here for a grasp.  If you're conducting  scientific resarch, it's a good idea to know why you're doing it the way  you're doing it, and what logical foundation your conclusions stand on.   They might not be what you assume.<br />Yes, this is abstract and advanced  writing.  Yes, it has sentences you could quote to make fun of how  philosophers seem not to have a life.  But if you take science very  seriously, then you need to think about some of these ideas, and you'd  rather read this book than lots of others.  The writing is clear.  The  volume is not overwhelming.  <br />My only real complaint is the particular  topic Phillips chose for his &quot;case study&quot; to illustrate how the  methodological principles and controversies apply to a particular area. He  chose as a research area the studyof people's cognitive development,  &quot;...what happens in the mind of a developing learner as he or she  tries to master some body of knowledge.&quot;  The topic is almost circular  with the philosophical material itself, and it becomes at times difficult  to untangle the statements about methodology and scientific principle from  statements about people's reasoning.  A different case study might have  been clearer, at least to me.  Then again, maybe any topic would have  similar difficulties.  On the plus side, anyone working in the area of  cognitive development will probably particularly appreciate this choice of  topics.<br />Overall, recommended for producers or direct consumers of social  science research.	2000-04-01

It covers how environment, psychodynamics, genes, and neurophysiology relate to  psychopathology.<br />Part C is Disorders and Treatments.  The focus is  heavily on adult psychopathology, with one chapter set aside for  &quot;child and adolescent psychopathologies&quot;.  <br />This book is far  from comprehensive -- for instance, in a discussion of major affective  disorders there is about half a page devoted to &quot;Biological  Treatments&quot; (three sentences for tricyclic drugs, one paragraph for  lithium, and one paragraph for ECT).  To be fair:  there is more on  biochemistry and tricyclics in a previous section on physiology, but the  organization is thus a little confusing, so that a reader encounters more  discussion of tricyclics under the &quot;physiology of depression&quot;  than under the &quot;treatment of depression&quot;.  <br />It's also not  exactly up-to-date; there's no mention of drugs newer than the tricyclics.   Prozac and its cousins are not here.  The book relies on DSM-III-R (the  official coding system which has since been revised to DSM-IV).<br />It's  still a reasonable choice for a beginning survey of adult psychopathology.   The fact that it's not comprehensive means it won't overwhelm you.  The  writing's fairly clear and you'll come away with a respectable starting  batch of information.  Just make sure you also find another source to cover  newer material.	2000-04-01

It means that it's all here  and that each topic is fully covered in the space of two pages.  Hence, by  just glancing down at the open book you will see an entire survey of, say,  &quot;Acute inflammation&quot;.  There are 41 such topics in all, grouped  into several categories:  natural immunity, adaptive immunity, potentially  useful immunity, undesirable effects of immunity, and altered immunity.   <br />The drawings are, as the author hints in the Preface, worth a million  words or so (apiece). Because any given immune activity involves so many  different cells, parts of cells, or molecules, the topic is far better  understood through sketches of how the parts interact than through words  alone.  The sketches here are EXCELLENT -- clear, complete, well labeled...  In short, just what any student wants.  The material is right there in  front of you for the pondering.<br />Each sketch is accompanied by a few  paragraphs of text and a list of terms defined.<br />Here is what the author  states in a section titled &quot;How to use this book&quot;:<br />&quot;Each  of the figures... represents a particular topic, corresponding roughly to a  45-minute lecture.  Newcomers to the subject may like first to read through  the text (left-hand pages) using the figures only as a guide....  Once the  general outline has been grasped, it is probably better to concentrate on  the figures one at a time&quot; (p.7).<br />A list of relevant textbooks,  which provided some source material for this book, is provided.<br />Very  highly recommended.	2000-03-29

He developed the Self-Monitoring Scale in 1972.  In  this book he describes the theory and his own and others' empirical  findings on self-monitoring.  He addresses questions of what exactly  self-monitoring is, how it varies from one person to the next, why we do  it, what consequences it has, and how people use it for benefit.   Differences between &quot;high self-monitors&quot; and &quot;low  self-monitors&quot; (i.e. self-monitoring is seen as a trait) are discussed  in depth.  An extensive reference list is included.  Pretty much everything  there is to know about the concept of self-monitoring up to 1987 is here --  which makes this a handy 200 pages for those who need or want to know this  stuff.<br />This book is quite technical -- but a reader could skip such  sections as &quot;Factor Analysis and the Class Model&quot;, which includes  sentences like, &quot;Accordingly, the self-monitoring class variable need  not appear as one of the axes in a factor solution involving rotation to  simple structure&quot; (p. 163), and still get a lot out of the book.<br />In  all it's a nice blend of theory and research and is worthwhile reading for  any student of personality or social psychology.	2000-03-29

The writing is clear and it provides solid coverage of how to define and categorize depression, how it's diagnosed, current knowledge of biological issues  (genetics and physiology of depression), and all the major psychological  theories and approaches to treatment (behavioral, cognitive, psychodynamic,  interpersonal).  Social and cultural aspects of depression are covered too.   There's a lot here; you could read just what interests you and skip any  sections that don't, or use the book as a reference.  I like the  comprehensiveness and the clear writing style. Definitely a good source for  learning about depression.   This is written for people interested in the  technical stuff, the research and theory of depression.	2000-03-29

Provides a different perspective than the typical textbook.  I bought this  when I was in high school and just looking to round out my understanding of  chemistry; I've kept it long past that because it's just plain a good book  to have around.

Which isn't to say the material here is wrong, just that it doesn't  include the very latest advances.<br />Still, ya gotta start somewhere, and  this book isn't a bad one to read along the way.<br />Gazzaniga tells stories  illustrating how fiddling with some specific part of the brain, or some  brain chemical, produces distinct effects on a person's behavior and  experience.  He also discusses how fiddling with someone's experiences  creates distinct effects on that person's brain, behavior, and other  experiences.  He covers Anxiety, Pain, Addictions, Love....<br />Gazzaniga  concludes with some words about what these research findings mean about how  we should live our lives.  He urges us to avoid oversimplifying, to avoid  thinking either that genes control everything or experience controls  everything.  He argues that the pattern is circular -- brain affects  experience and experience affects brain -- so that neither comes first, and  he talks about how change can happen (how to break into this cycle). For  that alone, it's worth the read.	2000-03-29

But I found the drawings too cute and flashy, even distracting.  They look like  an attempt to make the book appeal to the MTV crowd.  In this attempt I  think the book loses something.  The drawings take away from the text and  terms, and impede my understanding.  I don't appreciate a cartoon of a  monocyte as a shark and a macrophage as a bigger shark.  (Other cells are  depicted as elephant, octopus, beaver, whale....)  This only adds another  layer of work for the reader -- remembering which animal corresponds to  which cell.  And do I want my doctor, or a research biologist, thinking  &quot;Macrophage... macrophage... oh, yeah, that's Seymour the Shark in my  book.  Now I've got it&quot;? (To top it off, the cartoons aren't even  drawn that well, and they're surrounded by distracting blobs of color.  I  wasted time just trying to decipher what the cartoon was before I could get  around to trying to follow the story.)<br />A better choice is Playfair's  _Immunology at a Glance_.  It, too, uses pictures to convey the processes  and components of the immune system, but  with much more clarity and  directness (e.g. cells are just drawn to look like cells).	2000-03-29

If you're going to own a book about the history of this area, make sure you own this one.  It's a classic.   This book was  written in the late 1880s and describes in detail the settlement of various  communities along the lake (and interactions between Indian inhabitants and  French settlers), the building of military forts, and the pivotal battles  on and near the lake during the Revolution and the War of 1812.   The fact  that Lake Champlain was a crucial area in military history for this nation  means that a history of the lake will have a lot to say about military  engagements.  This one does. Each chapter begins with an overview, e.g.  &quot;1777-1783 -- Burgoyne invades the United States -- Evacuation of  Ticonderoga by General St. Clair -- Battle of Hubbardton -- Surprise and  Indignatio n of the People -- Vindication of St. Clair and Schuyler --  Lincoln's Expedition against Ticonderoga -- Surrender of Burgoyne --  Retreat to Canada -- Operations on Lake Champlain from 1778 to 1783.&quot;    The book includes an appendix with letters between Benedict Arnold and  other generals in the Battle of Valcour. This might not be the book to  start with if you're new to Lake Champlain and its history and you're not a  history buff.  But if you have any attachment to this geographical area or  if you are interested in the historical details of, say, the Battle of  Plattsburgh or Fort Ticonderoga, pick this one up.	2000-03-28

The only possible flaw in this book is that *a few* of the entries might be a little opaque to those who don't already know something about the given topic, but by far most of this book is extremely useful and  understandable.  <br />I bought this book as an undergraduate studying for the  GRE in Psychology (and yes, I think it did help) and have continued to use  it as a doctoral student.  It's been helpful at all levels.  I recommend it  to undergrads who are just interested in psychology, to anyone wanting to  brush up on any area of psychology, and to psychologists or  psychologists-in-training who want a handy reference to look up new or  unfamiliar terms.  It contains clear illustrations -- for example, of the  eye and of some optical illusions -- and includes a separate list of common  statistical formulas, a list of Greek symbols found in psychology, and a  list of abbreviations commonly found in psychology.  <br />It has entries for  everything from the most broad topics, e.g. &quot;behaviorism&quot;, which  gets a lengthy encyclopedic-like entry, to the most narrow, e.g.  &quot;phobophobia:  fear of fearing&quot;, &quot;bad trip&quot;, and  &quot;Barnum effect&quot;.  It includes biographical entries.  It includes  many entries concerning statistial analyses used in psychology -- factor  analysis, Latin square, rank order correlation, etc.  Every aspect of  psychology is included here -- the physiological, the psychoanalytic, the  behavioral, you name it.  All in a very small and concise package --  ordinary paperback size and probably less thick than the latest John  Grisham novel.<br />Each entry leaves you with a good grasp of the basics of  the term in question.<br />This is a good book for picking up and browsing if  you're just trying to edify yourself, and it's a good book to have handy if  you are surrounded by psychologists (or books) who occasionally hit you  with a term you aren't quite sure of or would like to know more  about.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-03-28

The tone is far less judgmental than that.  In fact,  Wile takes care to point out that he doesn't have one right answer or one  right interpretation of what goes on during the night in the life of this  couple.  He makes clear that he, as a therapist, is a human being like  anyone else and is subject to the same foibles as the couple illustrated  here.  We all are.  He simply has acquired some pretty good insights about  how these things work.  (He's a Ph.D. psychologist in private practice, or  was at the time of publication of this book anyway.)<br />Wile focuses (among  other things) on people's need to get their points across.  Reading this  book makes the reader feel understood, and then helps the reader see what  the other person in a fight might need to get across.  It's the kind of  book that makes you want to turn around and give it to significant others  in your life after you've finished reading it yourself and saying,  &quot;Yeah!  That's it!&quot; every other page.  I think it helps people  slow down, take a step back, and be less defensive (without even knowing  it, as Wile points out) in dealings with other people.<br />The book is an  extended, in-depth analysis of one single fight in one couple.  This focus  is a great way for us to see the practical realities of what Wile is  talking about -- as opposed to glib principles, which many books offer  alone.<br />If you're not already familiar with psychological lingo, don't  let some of the terminology in the introduction put you off.  The book as a  whole is extremely understandable, real, and useful. It's one of those  books you wish everyone would read, but, unlike many popular self-help or  psychology books, it's not a flash in the pan.  If you can read this and  take it to heart it can make a lasting difference in how you do things.  Not a quick fix, but a serious improvement.<br />I suppose if there's anything  I don't like about it it's some of the lingo (which is well explained) and  that it's a bit repetitive -- but that's easy to deal with because the  format of the book is such that it becomes easy to identify and just skim  some sections at the end which pretty much repeat things already covered  (if you want to).<br />I do strongly recommend this book.  And not just for  couples with major fighting problems.  For anyone -- we all have quibbles.

Whether you have quibbles (or major fights) with your spouse, your friend,  your coworker, your parent, your child, or your therapist, this book could  be enlightening.	2000-03-28

It is, as advertised, a handbook -- if you have a question about depression or mania, at least the beginnings of an answer can be found here.  Every topic related to affective disorders  -- defining the disorders, their course and treatment, etiology, social  aspects, biological aspects, psychodynamics, etc. -- is given some space.   42 chapters by a variety of British and U.S. authors cover lots of  ground.<br />This is not light reading but is about right for someone at or  beyond the advanced undergraduate level.  <br />It's quite broad and thus  somewhat cursory, some chapters more so than others.  You might want to  turn to a different book if you're looking for more fleshing out of any one  topic.  That's my complaint about this book.  In many areas it mentions  just one or two studies, described in one or two sentences, and that's the  total coverage of a topic, leaving the reader wondering what other (maybe  contradictory) research exists and how much stock to put in the studies  listed.  The conclusions of the studies are stated but the methodology is  not.  Here's an example from the &quot;Genetics&quot; chapter:   &quot;Cyclothymia.  This condition of repetitive high and low mood swings,  generally not requiring clinical attention, is probably genetically related  to bipolar disorder (Gershon et al 1982, Akiskal et al 1977).&quot;  That's  it! and then there's a new heading to introduce the next disorder.  I could  get this level of explanation in Good Housekeeping magazine (without the  citations, which, I admit, do make a difference).  I'm left wondering:  How  strongly related?  How probable?  Are these the only studies that exist on  that topic?<br />I presume this is a matter of trying to cover so much  material in so little space.  I'd rather learn about affective disorders by  reading separate books that go into more depth.  I suppose this book might  be good for an overview that directs you toward avenues offurther inquiry.  It might serve as a good refresher to have on the shelf after you've  mastered the subject in depth. But it's not very good for learning about  affective disorders for the first time, and it's not that good for brushing  up on details you don't recall.  It's not a BAD book, just not a  particularly GOOD one by itself.	2000-03-28

This book is FULL of wonderful photos, drawings, and maps ofeverything in Clinton County from the late 1600s to 1988.<br />Alongwith the photos and drawings is a narrative; the combination brings the history to life. There are photos of houses built in 1800, notable people from Lt. Thomas Macdonough to the 1986-87 SUNY Plattsburgh hockey team, every landmark you can think of and a whole lot you wouldn't have.  If you've lived in Clinton County, you'll see photos of the places you hang out -- as they looked in 1810 or 1910.  And you'll see (and read about) the people who used to hang out here.<br />It's a nice book for learning things, and it's a nice book for browsing through every so often.<br />This pictorial history really speaks for itself.  Anyone with ties to Clinton County should appreciate and enjoy it.  END	2000-03-28
US	52920773	R2XZGRYT86Q3U9	0898622239	60081616	White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control	Books	5	42	43	N	N	Easy to read, enlightening, offers different perspective	An excellent read for serious students of psychology AND for everybody else.  <br />The upshot of this book is that (according to Wegner's research, which is described in sufficient detail for the reader to make his or her  own judgments) the best way to get rid of an obsession is to stop trying  to.  Wegner's research has found that trying hard to squelch a thought is  likely to make it stick harder.<br />Wegner spends some time discussing how  this specifically might tie in to depression, in which a person gets stuck  in a rut of negative mood and thought and then is preoccupied with wishing  that negative mood weren't there.<br />You can also come up with areas in your  own life in which you've wanted to get rid of some thought and couldn't.    Wegner explains what to do when that happens.<br />&quot;Mental control&quot;  in the title refers to how we control our own thoughts -- using our  thoughts.  It's a bit of a puzzle and Wegner makes some good points about  it.<br />This book will give you a new perspective on this issue.  It's a slim  little book, not hard to read, but it is entirely serious and substantive.   No empty-headed pop psych here.  This is the real thing.	2000-03-28

It's certainly not pop-psychology style; this is scholarly stuff.  But if you're up for some scholarly stuff, this  is just what the title claims:  Essential Papers on Narcissism.  The  variety of viewpoints makes this a good collection to give you a broad  understanding of what's out there about narcissism.  You'll probably like  some of the articles more than others (the writing styles do vary), and  probably agree with some more than others, but the bottom line is that  there is worthwhile material here.  I found it thought-provoking and  edifying. But not a walk-in-the-park read.<br />The term  &quot;narcissism&quot; (like &quot;narcissist&quot;) seems to be used in  different ways, with somewhat different meanings, by different people these  days.  Reading these articles will help you get a grip on what the  important issues are, regardless of how you define the terms.  <br />Heavy on  theory (of course) and lingo that presupposes some background in  psychodynamic concepts and terminology.	2000-03-28

It contains some interesting points. One is that even very young children are affected by marital discord. Another is that exposure to discord is likely to make a child more, not less, sensitive to it.<br />The book has its drawbacks. It's repetitive and heavy on fluffy citations, like &quot;How couples handle differences is also important in marriages (Margolin, 1979; Markman &amp; Kraft, 1989).&quot; (p. 21). Do you really need someone else to back up an assertion that how couples handle differences is &quot;important&quot;?<br />Another example: &quot;Spousal disengagement and withdrawal are associated with current marital distress [three citations follow].&quot; If such statements of the vague and obvious were left out this book would be even slimmer than it is. These statements are the givens which made me want to read the book, to find out the why and how.	2000-03-28

No, it won't make you go buy Coke at the movie theater. So what WILL it make you do, and how do we measure it, and how do we know it occurs?  And is it good (or bad) for anything? This  book presents the state-of-the-art research on these questions.  Its  authors discuss how mood, memory, thought, and behavior might be affected  by subliminal perceptions and unconscious mental processes.<br />It's edited  by a clinical psychologist and a social psychologist and could be of  interest to people coming from either persuasion.  (The book has three  sections:  Cognitive, Clinical, Social.)<br />The book comprises eleven  chapters written by a slew of authors, most of whom have carried out their  own research on subliminal perception. Early research is covered as well as  the most recent efforts, and much attention is given to the surprisingly  puzzling question of how we can ever know subliminal perception has  occurred.<br />Worthwile reading for any serious student of research  psychology.  Not for those who don't like getting technical.	2000-03-28

I haven't looked at it in a few years but it sits on my bookshelf.  At first I thought I should go leaf through it before writing this review, but I  think my comments from memory will be more valuable.  After all, whatever  sticks with you several years after reading a book is telling.<br />The book  scared the pants off me, discouraged and depressed me somewhat (not that  that's the book's fault -- it's the facts' fault), and made a lasting  impression.  It presented daunting facts and figures -- how many billions  of tons of pollution we emit, how much trash there is that we don't know  what to do with, and so on.  It also presented things we can all do to help  -- from political activism to making better laundry choices.  I admit I  felt a little hopeless after reading it, because I would look at all the  suggestions and all the bad things we're doing and then look up from the  book and see people disregarding all of this, polluting wantonly, not  bothering to recycle, etc.  But once the edge wore off I think the book  left me with a higher awareness of the problem -- made it stick in my mind,  somewhat and served as a reminder to me.<br />It's got all the facts and  figures for anyone who wants them, and it's written in a simple, concise  format, sort of one issue per page, with issues gathered into categories.   It's probably just going to preach to the converted, but it does provide a  nice dose of inspiration and some handy facts and figures for them.	2000-03-28

I stumbled on this book at Amazon and bought it solely because of the customer reviews here.  The good reviews outnumbered and out-intensified the bad, and I was (am) intrigued by points of view that have gone  unconsidered.  My feeling was that you've just gotta like a book whose  subtitle is &quot;The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West&quot;.   Or at least ya gotta like the title....<br />It is one of the few books I  have decided to quit without finishing.  I gave it several extra chances  after initially contemplating quitting.  I've quit about a third of the way  through.  Maybe the remainder of the book redeems the problems that made me  quit.  I choose not to find out.  My comments are only about the first  third, then, and of course as always Maybe It's Just Me.  But my comments  still might be of value to potential readers, so here.<br />I found it darker  than I thought it needed to be Of course I'm not the arbiter of how dark it  needs to be, but it was darker than I wanted to read -- dark in a way that  felt not useful.  <br />I also found it required too much suspension of  disbelief.  I realize it's a fantasy, and I enjoy some fantasies, but I  just couldn't get past things like a goat who is able to speak quite clear  English (enough to be a university professor) yet who requires assistance  with writing because &quot;of course&quot; he can't use a pen and paper  with those hooves.  **But of course he can speak English with his lips and  tongue?**  If such incongruity made a good point, or were necessary to the  story, I would accept it, but.... it wasn't.  Or it was and I am  obtuse.<br />Some reviewers here said it gets off to a slow start.  Must be --  or it never gets going.  After reading the first quarter of the book I was  wondering when anything was going to HAPPEN that had anything to do with  the nature of evil.  I still hadn't seen anything thought-provoking.  The  witch was born and was discriminated against.  Some politics andreligion  happened, very superficially.  If there's more to the story, I was very  disappointed not to have found it yet.<br />Again:  Maybe it's just me.  Maybe  I'm not a sufficiently sophisticated reader.  (I think I am, but...)  But I  found this book not adding anything to my life.  I'd like to know what  other books the rave reviewers here have read, and what other sorts of  books they like.  I'm thinking they either just have different tastes than  mine or they have very low standards and don't know there's better out  there for provoking thought.	2000-01-03
