Pierce's characters remained believable and the plot continued to twist. <br />Although Pierce's writing style has not changed greatly from the way she wrote the other Tortall books, this one is much more depressing to read.  A child won't find most of the concepts hard to grasp, but even some adults may shy away from the stark descriptions of a bloody revolt by a people long oppressed.  That Aly, the books heroine, strives thoughout to minimize the bloodshed caused by her revolution does not help tame this element; rather, it forces the reader to endure the uglyness of war with still greater horrer and humanity. <br />Although the recomended reading age for this book is 12 and up, I believe the book is not suitable for all 12 year olds.  There are some emotionally trying deaths and a sex scene (which is very restrained, but still obviously sex).  Adults will also enjoy this book for the depth of its characters, setting, and plot.	2004-10-02
US	46090538	R2OATNGI5MPK9P	0895267152	594682043	Kokoro	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Beautiful but Slow	Kokoro is a classic of Japanese literature.  It follows the story of a young man who meets an elder one, who he calls Sensei (teacher, elder, master).  Sensei is at first very mysterious about his past, but the young man learns slowly of his deep loneliness and its causes.  Sensei had a life of betrayal and love turned sour. <br /> <br />The book is divided up into three sections: Sensei and I, My parents and I, and Sensei and his Testament.  The first chronicles the two men's meeting and their relationship.  The second describes the narrator going home to his parents only to find that he has changed so much that he no longer feels at home with them, and in fact honors Sensei above them.  The last is a letter written to the narrator by Sensei, telling of Sensei's past. <br /> <br />I must caution any prospective reader about two things.  First, the book is slow moving.  There are very few exciting scenes, but many pondorous ones.  This is due partly to the translation.  Having read the book first in Japanese, I think it is a bit faster paced in its native language.  Second, the author assumes that the reader knows some things about Japanese culture instinctivily.  Occasionally, you may find that a character's action which the author doesn't bother to explain seems puzzling.  I believe that any dedicated reader can, however, work through these obstacles and truly enjoy this book. <br /> <br />When the book is finished, readers often find themselves struggling with Sensei's character.  He has been through terrible things, but what of that?  People recover from worse things than he has passed through, and still seem cheerful enough.  Why must he be so weak willed? <br /> <br />The answer to these riddles lies in the book's title.  \\"Heart,\\" it might be, translated, or \\"center,\\" or \\"emotion.\\"  Sensei says of his own heart, \\"You see, loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egotistical selves.\\"	2004-09-02

It tells of Calwyn, who lived in Antaris where women learn the chantment Ice-call.  This magic is performed by singing, and is one of nine forms of chantment in the world.  She leaves the cloistered Antaris and goes on a voyage with the Sorceror Darrow, travelling to many places in order to defeat Samis, who is trying to take over the world by mastering each of the nine forms of chantment. <br /> <br />There were two major flaws in the book.  This first was that the minor characters lacked depth.  Even though a good part of the book centered on the death of a minor character, I did not feel attached to him or sad about his death.  This is common for first novels, and I expect it to improve in the sequel.  The second flaw was that the plot resolved itself fairly predictably.  Veteran fantasy readers will find no suprises in the last hundred pages.  However, I expect that as Constable gains confidence, this, too, will change in the second and third volumes. <br /> <br />Overall, the prose is enjoyable, and the main characters are likeable.  This book is recommended for light reading during down time.	2004-09-01

However, 'The People of Peace,' who led a non-violent movement against the great wars of Earth, were also sent to the planet be the government of a great nation.  When the novel begins, the people of the prison colony enjoy great comforts in town, disdaining the People of Peace, who do their farming.   <br /> <br />Those who live outside the city grow tired of this poor exchange, and want to go found a new city, with no oppression.  The novel explores the struggle to do this, as the non-violent people question their own ideals.   <br /> <br />This book has beautiful moments, and the characters are well-conceived.  However, it lacks the depth of some of Le Guin's other novels like The Dispossesd and The Left Hand of Darkness.  It is an enjoyable read, but in the end it is lighthearted rather than than deep and pondering.	2004-08-30

Unlike the others, the characters have great depth and the story is original.   <br /> <br />This book is a collection of three shorter novels, which are now almost completley unavailable.    The follow the story of Morgan of Hed, the ruler of a simple land of farmers, who finds that his fate leads him to leave his land.  He endures perils for reasons he does not understand, and finds friendship amoung the rulers of other lands.  Most of the books follow his journeys and the journeys of his lover, Raerderle. <br /> <br />One of the most memorable elements of the books is the concept of riddles.  These are stories of things that happened long ago which have acute meaning for the present time.  Morgan's plight is echoed in the riddles which appear throughout the book, and some of the riddles are truly beautiful in their own right. <br /> <br />Some have commented that this work is not entirely mature.  Although this is true to a limited extent (occasionally a line of dialogue sounds unnatural), it is not a large enough problem to distract readers from the beauty of the whole work.  It is appropriate for ages 12 and up, and wonderful for adults as well as children.	2004-08-28

However, the plot does not follow the typical progression for such a story.  At first Faris does not believe in magic, though she performs it herself.  Then, she begins to wonder if she is meant to overthrow her uncle and rule her duchy after all. <br />This book is extremely engrossing.  I bought it in the afternoon and did not go to bed until I finished it.  I believe this was partly due to the author's lovely writing style, and partly because her main character has more depth than is typical of children's books. <br />There are some major flaws in the book, but it should be noted that I did not stop to notice them until several hours after I finished it.  The largest is that the plot jumps around a bit too quickly.  The story Stevermer tells really deserves two volumes to be explained fully.  The second is that many of the characters- in fact, nearly all of the characters except the protagonist- have no depth, but are one-sided.   <br />Overall, this book is a very enjoyable read for both adults and children, but its technical execution could have been improved.	2004-08-26

Even if you're not willing to take as serious an approach to tea as Helen does, this book can teach you some great tips for making and appreciating tea. <br />My only complaint is that some of the recipes do not yield results quite as good as the author's description of them.

Keladry is a thoughtful, stoic heroine, but readers will find themselves attached to her nevertheless as she attempts to become the first female knight since Alanna, training openly as a woman. <br />As an added element of interest, Keladry spent her early life on the Yamani isles, which Pierce patterned after Japan.  This gives the reader an idea of the larger world around Tortall, and will be fascinating for fans familiar with Pierce's other works. <br />Keladry is an entertaining character, and her dedication and loyalty allow her to serve as a role model to readers.	2004-08-13

Each entry begins with a profile of the author, including his or her major works and a short biography, then has between 1 and 3 short stories.  Afterwards, many entries have an essay by the author about the work, or have extensive information about the historical context of the story.<BR>This book strives to be complete, with selections of different styles of writing, various themes, and non-western as well as Western authors.  It suceeds in this to a certain extant, but the majority of the stories are written by white American men.  However, many other stories are included.<BR>Because of the size of this tome, it may be difficult for the reader to discover the very good stories buried admist the mediocre.

It alternates between sections of the writer`s life and the stories told deep in the rainforest.  At first these seem incoherent and leave the reader groping for something left out, but the last section of storytelling is lyrical, the best piece I have read for quite a while, and we finally understand.<BR>The traslation is admirable, and the prose is descriptive and readable.

However, some are repetitive, and some just plain uninteresting.

However, Rhoda`s character dims slightly as she enters adulthood.  She gets married, divorces, and has sex; all for a couple hundred pages that aren`t particularly inspired.  The last two stories, however, make up for the lapse, as we see Rhoda finally matured.<BR>Overall, I reccomend this book.

I was dissapointed by Pierce's most recent books, especially the Circle Opens quartet.  However, in this book Pierce comes back, better than ever.  In the Song of the Lioness, Pierce wrote a beuatiful story of knighthood and triumph, but Pierce has aged, and has presented us with the story of her daughter, who is not a national hero but is nevertheless responsible for as much as her mother is.  The crowning scene of the book is the naming day of Diane's daughter, when Pierce finds words to express the idea that has run through every story she has ever written.  But I won't give any spoilers!<BR>The book also presents a good deal of political intrigue, mixed up relations with the gods, and romance.  I think it is 10 and up, but this should not stop high school students from reading it, because it is probably at its best in their hands.	2003-11-02

It is a book to be read slowly, thinking about each plane as it is presented.  The best part of the book is it's concluding story, which is something like a metaphor for Le Guin's life to this point, a blur of possibilities, imaginings, and outcomes.

The text is less filled with archaic or strictly philosophical phrases than most books in this field, giving it a comprehensibility that is too often lacking in the mind-body problem.  Searle is a brilliant rhetorician, and every one of his arguments is worded in a convincing way.

It is separated into short chapters, which are each akin to short bursts of thinking on the protagonist's part.  Crossley-Holland successfully portrays a maturing boy with concerns about his future, the class system of the time, and his tail bone, which he believes is growing.<br />As part of a trilogy, this book is promising.  However, it takes a while for the action to begin, and the seeing stone of the title is not employed until nearly half way through the book.  The book will be found more interesting by those who have a good knowledge of the original Arturinian legends, since they will be more able to see the parallels between his life and the Arthur of this series'.  <br />Overall, this book is enjoyable and the series is promising.	2002-09-02

Its joys and griefs are deeper than those of The Lord of the Rings, and its stories are more beautiful and haunting.<br />The price paid for this is the writing.  It is intensely descriptive, and does not read quickly.  A bit of patience is nessacery to start the Silmarillion, but any reader who gets a little ways into it will quickly forget the frustration of the first few pages.  <br />Among the highlights of the volume are the tale of Beren and Lutien, which speaks of a love born between the kindreds of elves and men which is haunted by the sorrow of the enemy; the tale of Turin Turambar, which is a haunting account of fate, courage, and the power of a desperate will against evil; and the tale of Earendil, which is Tolkien's message of enduring hope and an account of the end of the first age.  <br />This book is highly recommended.	2002-08-26

Le Guin's latest addition to the Earthsea Cycle is truly a triumph. In the third book in this series, The Farthest Shore, Ged the Archmage sets out on a quest that ends in the restoration of the balance between life and death, the living and the dead... or so it seems. In the Other Wind, Le Guin portrays an unrestful land, where the dead start reaching over the wall that seperates them from the living. We are able to meet the characters from the other Earthsea books again, who have all matured and changed. In fact, Ged and Tenar are leading restful, almost ordinary lives at home. Some readers may find it unsettling to find their hero's lives so changed, and the land of Earthsea quivering on its foundations, but the conclusion of the novel brings together everything good about the books. With this final novel, Earthsea seems to be bound together again, unshakingly, although not without a few seperations... The song of the woman of Kemay presides, hauntingly, over the plotline of the book.<br />Farther west than west,<br />Beyond the land,<br />My people are dancing<br />On the other wind.	2001-08-31
