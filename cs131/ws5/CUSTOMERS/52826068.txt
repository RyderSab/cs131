While some of the characters and plot directions are just excellent(Josh &amp; Doug, Emmeline &amp; Toby, Jackie) others seemed so completely superfluous (Marly, Ryan)that they barely intersected with the main narrative and seemed designed merely to pad out the book. Still, pleasant enough and worth reading.	2003-10-21

I picked this up because I loved the thought of the ex-teacher revealing the life of a former student through his memoirs and her memories.  Too bad that isn't really the book.  Elizabeth Stone uses Vincent as an excuse to write her own autobiography- and believe me, her story makes you long to hear Vincent's all the more.  Perhaps his diaries were very vague or his family reticent of having his life detailed - both understandable.  But, given that, there isnlt really a worthwhile project here.  I got so bored that I kept skipping pages looking to find Vincent's story and all I really kept finding was hers.  Ugh!  A vanity project all around.	2003-10-11

I have only given it three stars because the one thing that bothered me is that the added mystery - while enjoyable -- made me feel as if the author some how set up and then chickened out on the more adult, difficult aspects of the story - as if he was afraid that we would stop reading and just dismiss it as another coming out tale.  Regardless, there is a lot of good stuff here and it is much better than a lot of the gay novels floating around now.	2003-10-11

It is well written and has some wonderful characters.  The narrator is beautifully drawn and Malloy's writing really sucks you into his head so you experience all the joy, drama and heartache along with him.

I LOVED The Men from the Boys; it is one of my favorite newer gay novels, so I was very excited about this.  But, I have very mixed feelings here.<br />Pros: Mann makes some wonderful observations about the gay lifestyle in relation to AIDS in this era, the self destructiveness of certain behavior, etc.  But that's about it.<br />Cons: 1) Wow.  There is a \\"mystery\\" that runs almost to the very last page of the novel.  A mystery that any reader will solve a few pages into the setup.  I mean it is ridiculous to believe that ANY gay man wouldn't have thought out the angle to that story - never mind a character who is an educated, writer.  It becomes REALLY torturous as we keep waiting for him to figure it out.<br />2) The other main character has become almost too new-agey spritual.  To the point where some dialogue is really annoying and makes you almost cringe. 3) Eva.  Hello?  Really - yeah, we'd all put up with that. 4) I guess these two great characters now just seem ... dumb.<br />Flip side:  if you haven't read the first book, it does have it's fun moments and some good social observations.  But as a sequel it is a letdown.  It's like Mann wanted to write a sequel but didn't have a real story so he concocted this strange platform for the boys return.	2003-06-14

We were all very young and just coming out ourselves.  Within the pages of this book we found exactly what Larry Kramer did not intend for us to see: a sexy, partying, unfettered, glamorous gay New York.  Uh,huh.  The satire was lost on us. Rather, we all talked about partying our ....off and moving to New York. We lived in Boston- so we did the weekend thing instead.  Anyway, this is one trippy, weird and excessive novel. I really think all the excess undoes his intent and turns this into a Jackie Collins on hormones and mda extravagana.  Of course, that does not mean that it wasn't entertaining and the not-to-distant future ultimately proved Larry's point for him. Dance from the Dance does a much better job at tackling this theme.	2003-01-21

I think it's first printing was limited as it was even a little hard to get a first edition when it was published.  Anyway, this collection is both funny and heartbreaking.

His style is vivid yet dreamlike.  I read this book a couple of years after it first came out and I never forgot it.  Already the world was starting to change and yet that New York hedonsistic gay lifestyle had really spread to other gay urban areas.  I think most of us knew a Sutherland and a Malone.  Anyway, it is funny, moving and an amazing snapshot of what the gay lifestyle was like at the time.  To younger readers who dismiss this as the olden days, I say two words: Circuit Party.  Now, read the book the again.	2003-01-21

Very connected to the industry, he drifted, cashed in on his looks and lifestyle and became one the first real gay pornstars.  His stories about making these films are often funny and always interesting. (think body makeup and hot lights!)

The good points:  interesting characters, detailed motivations, and a generally captivating story.  The bad points: a very annoying almost voice-over type narration that creeps in occasionally, the author's constant desire to impress us with the books he's read and, after all the wordiness that comes before it, a very tidy, pat little ending.  However, this is not a bad book and there is stuff to enjoy.  Just don't feel badly when you want to skip a few pages or if you have the desire to roll your eyes at some of the conceit.	2002-11-09

I read this over several days while commuting to work, so that may have done it a disservice since there are MANY one dimensional characters here.  After a the first couple of days, it was hard to keep them straight. That being said, however, my commute reading was not inspiring me to keep reading it AFTER I got home either.  This story just kind of sits there.  The characters are either stereotypes or paper-thin; you really don't care about most of them.  Also, the aggressiveness of taking over this town almost had me routing for the residents.<br />Not much to keep you interested here.

Everything I saw or heard was pretty positive and it sounded like a good story to get lost in.  Well, I would be lieing if I said that it did not have SOME entertainment value - but this book is so over the top (and not in the good, fun way).

The detail of the narrator's childhood, his brother and parents is so real. All<br />the insecurities, love, childhood memories are captured beautifully.  I was very drawn to this family - the father in particular who was guilty maybe of being too loving, too much of a family man -- and I had a hard time dealing with the determined, headstrong way in which the children worked to separate themselves.<br />Also, as the narrator grows older and accepts his homosexuality in college - everything seems very rushed.  It is just one declaration of \\"this is me and I'm gay (*snap* sometimes)\\" after another. Not a lot of detail around his college life - it seems a little forced after so much examination of his childhood.  It just rang false for me.  One other annoying detail (and my time clock could be off)but some of the pop culture references<br />Bottom line - I think most people would be greatful for such a nurturing, loving upbringing.  The fight to get away pulled me into that whole \\" be yourself, realize yourself\\" kind of mentality.  I mena the parents embraced the kids differences, even separate amicably (if emotionally)...I guess in some ways the story just comes off as kind of selfish.<br />What is good here, though, is great.  And I highly reccommend this for what is good.  The other stuff ... maybe it's just me.	2002-08-26

Well, as a gay man I tend to find this type of fiction where all gay men act and speak more like teenage girls pretty offensive. However, if it was really funny, I guess I could make allowances.

In fact, it succeeds wildly in its genre of plain, entertaining gay novels.  It is a LOT better than most of them, but not for those who only embrace the real literary stuff. Think Jackie Collins or Judith Krantz for the gay set.  Characters are fun -- villains and heroes, both -- and all have detailed back histories (or baggage) to carry around.  Occasionally its has an uncomfortable Gordon Merrick moment, but it comes back again.  Highly recommended for a true entertaining read.	2002-05-08

I live in Boston and have spent a considerable time going back and forth to New York over the years.  I think I spent most weekends there in the mid-80's.  Anyway, I moved in a different crowd form Mel's Boston crew, but I knew some of them casually.  His appendix held a few surprises for me as to what happened to some of them.<br />The book is a great gay history of that period in New York.  It brought back many memories of both happy and sad times.  Earlier sections were before my \\"era\\", so I found them very interesting.  I felt like I knew many of the people Mel talks about and remember watching and listening as the club music scene grew.  There are many interesting stories about this phase of the music industry.<br />My only reservation:  Mel did do some great things, but Mel knows it.  So we know it.  A lot.  Just a tad too much back-patting.  Otherwise a great read about New York Gay life and the rise of club music.	2002-05-02

Davis prose is so captivating that I really felt as if I was there.  Actually, I wanted to be there.  I wanted to help these people and spend a sunny afternoon having cocktails on beach with them.

Never subtle, often over the top - but certainly exciting.  This book was reworked from a manuscript discovered after his death. Like Brassart mentions in the afterward, one can see the lack of orientation/tightness to the story and that is AFTER it has been edited and reworked. This one has a plot that travels all over the world, hits the media and celebrity between the eyes and never, ever stops.  A little too cartoonish and over the top. The bodycount is absolutely amazing.  Sadly, there is no real depth here to any of the characters and it's outlandishness, finally, does it in.

It is so strangely gay that it almost comes off as being homophobic.  For example: Matty (the detective) makes a point at the very begining of the book that he has never worn a dress ... yadda, yadda.  But, he calls everyone dearie and sweetie and thinks he looks &quot;scrumptious&quot; in purple.  Next thing you know he is bedding a woman (and suspect).  She apparently is a &quot;fall&quot; and he has problems with how she dresses ... oh well.  There is one section where he meets the father of the jailbait boy hooker he is living with that has to be read to be believed. Throughout it all he puts down other gay men for their age, weight, income, hang-outs .. whatever.  Honestly, I don't think I've ever read a book with such an annoying lead character.  Try the Nathan Aldyne mysteries instead for a good, humorous look at the gay 80's.	2002-01-15

I loved his first two novels (and could not be bothered to even read the &quot;boyfriend within&quot; thing).  Anyway, I was hoping for a lot more.  This is well witten, but just does not seem to go anywhere.	2002-01-15

It almost felt like looking at an old photo album before the world changed on us.	2002-01-15

I've re-read this one numerous times; it holds a permanent place in my library.  A great story representative of its era.  Sadly so much of Picano's other work is full of pretense.  This is, I think, his only book where all of his characters are just that - and likable as well.  A fun ride!	2002-01-15

Suffice it to say the narrator exists almost only to moon over the other main character, a horrific mess of a girl - most of my homosexual friends would have run from her fairly quickly.  Then again, with a narrator so underdeveloped perhaps his sole existence is to tell theAmity Stone story.  Anyway, I did very little laughing, groaning mostly.  Hope these two aren't based on real people!	2000-10-12

The  language gets so heavy handed -- how many similes and metaphors can you  take -- and  melodrama, boy! At times this book was like reading the worst  sections of Anne Rice's Violin over and over and over ...  Yeah, yeah,  yeah .. I got it already!  Move on.	1998-09-02
US	52826068	R33XUSTVRWW7O9	0525943358	727681212	The Men from the Boys	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Beautiful, Moving, and a little Scary	I cannot remember the last time I read a &quot;gay novel&quot; that I was so taken with the parrallels to my own life.  Growing up with Andrew Holleran and Felice Picano in the late 70s and early 80s, I've struggled to find anything since that actually told the story of what was happenening around me now.  This is the time I'm living: partnered, settled, in love, anxious, confused, questioning, and yes, a hint of that mid-life crisis kind of thing.  This novel really hit home and moved me deeply.	1998-07-16
