But I do know that these men are combat veterans, and that their service should be honored and their testimony considered.  The Kerry camp's effort to discredit these men by calling them liars, without a scintilla of substantiation, is fatuous and, worse, beneath contempt. <br /> <br />By the way, if you want to take a temporary break from this issue in particular and from politics in general (and who doesn't?), then I heartily recommend the newly published and very funny book, \\"Sense and Nonsensibility\\", by two \\"scholars\\", Alexander George and Lawrence Douglas.	2004-09-03

I'm grateful, therefore, to Joseph Pearce for this truly excellent biography (which, unlike his work on Belloc, actually contains photos!) <br />  <br /> But, with all respect and appreciation, I must mention some aspects that annoyed me. First, Mr. Pearce's prissy tut-tutting regarding Campbell's gloves-off attacks on his detractors (as well as his -- gasp! -- &quot;reactionary&quot; politics) is rather wearisome. Second, I was stunned to read [p. 161] &quot;When, three years later, Hart Crane committed suicide by throwing himself off the very same [Brooklyn] bridge....&quot; Come now, Mr. Pearce! Even the most elementary research would have informed you that Crane committed suicide by jumping from a ship in the Gulf of Mexico. Finally, Mr. Pearce's &quot;Postmortem&quot; is a bit weak, as he doesn't offer his assessment of Campbell's reputation as a poet some 50 years after his death. <br />  <br /> Well, I had to get that off my chest. None of the mentioned negatives, however, detract in any way from my hearty recommendation of this book.	2004-08-05

But avoid John Keel like the plague, particularly this book.  &quot;The Complete Guide to Mysterious Beings&quot; is anything but.  Rather, it is a tendentious polemic; a synopsis of Keel's own peculiar brand of existentialism and nihilism.<br />What to make of an &quot;investigator&quot; whose theories regarding strange phenomena are far weirder than the happenings themselves?  What to make of this self-annointed pedant who sneers at established belief systems, the most elementary tenets of which he can't even grasp?  On page 209, for example, Keel writes:  &quot;According to tradition, an angel named Gabriel impregnated Mary.&quot;  Indeed?  And what tradition might that be?  Keel's ignorant (or is it deliberate?) blasphemy regarding the Annunciation is mind-boggling.  As for the rest of the book, it's merely mind-numbing.	2003-09-15

His Excellency writes well, is knowledgeable and informative, and is highly successful in provoking thought and in engendering spiritual fervor.<br />Although not quite in the same league as Archbishop Sheen, Bishop Bruskewitz shares many of his attributes -- and some of his failings.  Both Archbishop Sheen and Bishop Bruskewitz are rather prone to redundancies and, by inevitable extension, in writing books that are somewhat longer than they need to be.<br />I should note that I was (albeit respectfully) somewhat taken aback by His Excellency's apparent enthusiasm for the Second Vatican Council, given that the Church's ghastly problems date back some 40 years -- i.e., to Vatican II.<br />A curiosity worth mentioning:  On page 189, Bishop Bruskewitz attributes the saying &quot;How odd of God to choose the Jews&quot; to Chesterton.  I had always thought that this little rhyme was one of Belloc's creations.  Belloc, apparently, denied ownership, and we must take him at his word.  But I have never before heard Chesterton's name mentioned as the father of this quotation.  Anyway, as I said, just a curiosity.<br />Bottom line (and, yes, a redundancy):  &quot;A Shepherd Speaks&quot; is a must-read.	2003-08-24

What could possibly be more important than the extremely persuasive scientific evidence offered by Mark Antonacci that the Shroud of Turin's image was produced by miraculous means -- i.e., by means that science cannot understand, explain, or replicate?  The question, of course, is rethorical.  It's abundantly clear, except to those who are willfully obtuse, that the Shroud is indeed the burial cloth of Our Lord Jesus Christ.  The implications of this inescapable conclusion are mind-boggling.  It is truly tragic that the vast majority of people are ignorant of the Shroud, indifferent to it, contemptuous of it, or transparently hostile.  Indeed, how many are even aware of the extensive scientific investigation of the Shroud and of the conclusions reached?<br />Antonacci does a good job articulating what science has to say about this incomparable relic.  He's only an adequate writer, however, and revels too much in scientific jargon.  Also, I would have liked him to address the views and teachings of Holy Mother Church as they pertain to this magnificent jewel in her crown.  Other criticisms can be leveled against the author, but they pale  when compared to the overall excellent job he has done in bringing this all-important and fascinating story to light.  I say bravo!

Highly recommended, but there is a caveat.  George Weigel occasionally \\"argues\\" by fiat.  For example (p. 104):  \\"No serious person doubts that psychology and psychiatry can be of help in handling problems of clerical sexual abuse.\\"  Implying what?  That only the frivolous would have the temerity to so doubt?  Weigel's assessment may very well be correct, but since when is dismissiveness an acceptable replacement for argumentation and reason (except of course for those who subscribe to Catholic Lite)?  This kind of \\"argumentation\\" is unworthy of Weigel, and is indicative and symptomatic of rushed aspects of the book, though his desire to get his prescriptions for reform out as soon as possible is understandable and laudable.  The bottom line is that \\"The Courage To Be Catholic\\" is extraordinarily cogent and inspiring.  I very much hope that Weigel has sent a copy to every bishop, archbishop and cardinal in the country.  And, certainly, this book is a must-read for every Catholic.	2002-10-09

Highly recommended, with only a few caveats.  First, Bruce Thornton's conclusion is a bit of a cop-out.  Second, he doesn't sufficiently address the coercive and potentially violent characteristics of anger-driven politically correct multiculturalists and their brainwashed and robotic followers.  Finally, contrary to Thornton's contention, suasion doesn't depend exclusively on scientific and empirical evidence.  Rational and reasoned discourse, particularly with an appeal to natural law, common sense and tradition, as well as to established and legitimate history -- on behalf of religious truth and morality, for example (see Robert George) -- has its place.

Hilaire Belloc was, in his day, an incomparable   Defender of the Faith; he continues, almost 50 years after his death, to instruct and inspire, and is worthy of emulation.<br />The book is well-written and well-researched.  It's occasionally a bit too much by-the-numbers, and declines somewhat toward the end, mirroring the decline of Belloc (one gets the impression that Joseph Pearce began to lose interest in Belloc as his subject's life entered its final and least interesting phase).<br />I think that, overall, Old Thunder would be pleased with \\"Old Thunder\\".	2002-09-27

Outside of a mere handful (including the Holy Father himself and Father George Rutler), no one today can be even remotely compared to Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen.  This is hardly surprising, given the number of politicians, managers, and blatant dissidents within the Church's current hierarchy.<br />I can't laud this orthodox book highly enough.  It's beautifully written, remarkably incisive, and provokes thought, while engendering spiritual fervor.  To be sure, the book is a bit long and occasionally redundant.  There are only two significant negatives, however, neither of which is Archbishop Sheen's fault or responsibility.  First, the cover art.  Of all the magnificent and inspiring artistic depictions of Christ Crucified, why the editors selected a flat and ugly painting by the empty Salvador Dali is quite a mystery.  Second, and more importantly, the biblical quotations are from &quot;The New English Bible&quot; (an awful and mundane translation).  I have no doubt that the original edition of this book contained quotes from THE Bible -- the Douay-Rheims.<br />The bottom line?  This is an outstanding book, which needs to be read today even more than when it first appeared.	2002-09-15

Ralph Sarchie's attempt to combine lurid entertainment value with apparent theological sophistication is a dismal failure.  In addition, Sarchie subscribes to New Age beliefs that are alien to Catholic teaching -- e.g., an acceptance of the reality of nature spirits.  Also, despite Sarchie's endless &quot;explanations&quot; (circomlocutions, actually), he never tells his readers what we're positively panting to know:  How did he obtain a relic of inestimable power -- a sliver from the True Cross?  Last, but certainly not least, tentative (and I stress the word) research seems to indicate that Sarchie's colleague in exorcism, Bishop Robert McKenna, is a sedevacantist -- i.e., he isn't in obedience to Pope John Paul II.  If this is in fact the case, Sarchie should seek out worthier allies.  Of course, Sarchie indicates (without being explicit) that he too is a sedevacantist -- i.e., [page 284] &quot;I was raised a Roman Catholic, but became a Traditionalist Catholic in July of 1999....  It took me a long time to realize that I wasn't comfortable with the modernization of Catholic liturgy that resulted from Vatican II.&quot;  Well, I'm no fan of Vatican II, which has been an unmitigated and inarguable disaster for the Church.  Nevertheless, I remain true to Rome.  And that fidelity is the difference between being a Catholic and a heretic.<br />Not recommended.	2002-07-30

Moreover, for a book first published 50 years ago, \\"The World's First Love\\" remains fresh and relevant.  To be sure, some aspects are a bit dated:  Communism is not the threat it was in 1952, and the same is true of atomic war.  Also, Archbishop Sheen has proven to be more optimistic than history has warranted.  He more or less predicts, for example, that within 30 years (that is, by the 1980s) the world would have pretty much seen the Light that is Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  Tragically, that wasn't true 20 years ago, and it's certainly not true today (if the sewage was up to our waist in 1982, it's up to armpits in 2002).<br />No matter.  This is a beautiful book on Mary, and I heartily recommend it (along with \\"A Woman Clothed with the Sun\\" as a delightful companion piece).	2002-07-19

A Catholic, by definition, must recognize the inarguable legitimacy of the Magisterium -- i.e., the teaching authority of the Church, which is invested in the Holy Father (usually with the bishops in conjunction with him; but with or without them...).  It is the Pope who teaches Catholics on all matters pertaining to faith and morals, and his teachings must be accepted by all of the faithful.  In rejecting this teaching authority, Garry Wills has spiritually separated himself from Holy Mother Church.  In seeking to Protestantize the Church, he's condemned himself as a schismatic and a heretic.  Despite the damage that he and others of his ilk have already inflicted, and will no doubt continue to inflict, Our Lord has promised that the gates of Hell will never prevail against His Church.  All good and true Catholics can take much comfort from that promise.	2002-07-14

There are problems, however.  For one thing, the book is too long and padded.  Moreover, it does not even remotely approach a top-flight mystery.  No, I couldn't figure out who did it (the use of deductive reasoning is pointless here, for there are really no clues with which to work).  But I did know who didn't do it.  Unlike Agatha Christie, for example, Michael Jecks doesn't know how to reveal the inner thoughts of his characters without revealing their innocence!  This, of course, is a major weakness for any mystery writer.<br />The bottom line?  This is an enjoyable read, as long as one doesn't expect too much from it.	2002-07-11

How can anyone answer Mr. Kimball's contention that our culture is awash in sewage; that the source of that sewage was the cultural revolution of the 1960s; and that Mailer and others of his ilk facilitated the toxic flow?  In my opinion, no one can -- at least not effectively or with honesty.<br />Erudite, and well-written, researched, reasoned, and argued, there is little with which to find fault.  I must say, though, that I don't fully agree with Mr. Kimball's contention that traditional values \\"are rooted deeply in a God-fearing Protestant ethic....\\"  Perhaps.  I would argue, however, that mainstream Protestantism has been absolutely corrupted by secularism, and that Christian Fundamentalism is intellectually and theologically hopeless.  It is, rather, the Catholic Church that has been the most standfast moral bastion, which is why she is perceived as the last formidable foe by the extreme Left.  <br />I congratulate Mr. Kimball on a worthy effort.

He renders a powerful (if not absolutely conclusive) argument that the perpetrator was a great white, rather than a bull, shark.  Moreover, he breathes new life into the old, and today largely discredited, theory of the rogue shark (and of rogue animals in general).  This theory appears to be out of favor today primarily because of politically correct -- i.e., intellectually bankrupt -- reasons.  And Mr. Capuzzo is clearly not one to be cowed by the intellectually bankrupt.<br />Mr. Capuzzo does an equally terrific job recreating the historical period in which the attacks took place, and the reader waxes nostalgic.

Granted, it may be partly the fault of the amateurish writing (or the translation), but the good Father comes across as, well, rather silly.  I'm sure he's not, but that's the impression with which I'm left.<br />Furthermore, Father Amorth is clearly an adherent of the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church.  In the interests of full disclosure, I must say that this movement is not at all my cup of tea; I consider it far more Protestant than Catholic.<br />Not recommended.	2002-03-07

Professor George is remarkably erudite and courageous (and always civil) as he stands toe-to-toe with his opponents on abortion and indeed the gamut of issues in which our moral and cultural health and fitness are so manifestly rooted.<br />There is one problem with \\"The Clash of Orthodoxies,\\" however.  No, it's not ideological (though I'm not in lock step agreement with the good professor); it's stylistic.  Professor George's writing is typical of academics: long and convoluted sentences, replete with recondite observations, parenthetical asides and qualifiers, and gratuitous adverbs, adjectives, and \\"big\\" words unknown to 98% of even the literate public.  I suggest that the professor take a gander at Father Rutler's \\"A Crisis of Saints.\\"  He addresses the same issues as Professor George, but in language that is both elegant and accessible.<br />Still, I heartily recommend \\"The Clash of Orthodoxies,\\" and hope that it will have a wide and profound influence.	2002-03-03

For one thing, this book was rushed into publication to take advantage of the recently released Richard Gere film (which has since disappeared).  This is evidenced by the weak writing and very poor editing, as well as by the shameless plugging.  In addition, the book has no real structure; it's a hodgepodge.  At one point, for example, Coleman engages in a defense against the criticisms of Darren Naish.  Ho-hum.  And the reader is subject to way too much pretentious and often incoherent theorizing.  This is especially true when Coleman rhapsodizes about his silly little \\"name game\\" concept -- e.g., [page 166] \\"In acknowledging the possible links between these named locations and Fortean events, the objective is not linear, that is to say, is not solely bound to the immediate and obvious events recorded, but may in fact be a part of a larger, symbolic ritual magnified by the power of the electronic media, for the purpose of processing in the subconscious.\\"  No doubt.

Books	3	9	16	N	N	Tendentious	Despite an erratic and often clumsy writing style, Ralph Martin manages to make some key points regarding the Church in crisis.  Indeed, giving credit where it's due, Mr. Martin is notably successful in getting many of these points across through the use of statistics -- no easy task.<br />My main probem with this book is Mr. Martin's true agenda.  His primary objective is to engage in charismatic apologetics.  The charismatic movement within the Catholic Church remains highly controversial -- and, in the interests of full disclosure, is not at all to my taste.<br />A much better book on the Church (and the West) in crisis is Father Rutler's &quot;A Crisis of Saints.&quot;	2002-02-12

Moral law is based on religion, and religion is based on belief in God.  Mr. Fairlie's refusal to fully accept this premise blunts the point he wishes to make:  Our culture is crumbling under the onslaught of the Seven Deadly Sins in ascendancy (and the situation has deteriorated considerably and visibly since this book first appeared).<br />Leaving aside his mystifying choice of Vint Lawrence as an illustrator, the only time Mr. Fairlie fails miserably (indeed, it almost cost him a star) is in his pompous and almost incoherent chapter, \\"The Paths of Love,\\" where he makes such risible statements as:  [page 209] \\"In nothing has our science made us more free than in the fearlessness of its search for truth and its willingness to confront it.\\"  Oh, please.<br />The bottom line?

Michael Jones is erudite, expresses himself elegantly, and makes a powerful case for &quot;Modernity as Rationalized Sexual Misbehavior&quot;.  Can modernity be boiled down to this, and only this, however?  I think not (which is not to imply that modernity possesses any saving graces; my contempt for this calamitous creed is at least as great as Mr. Jones').  The author's idee fixe is most explicit in his unpersuasive chapter on Picasso.  According to Mr. Jones [pp.142-143], &quot;Picasso's mutilations of the female body bespeak the modern version of human sacrifice; they presage simultaneously in a visual way the concentration camp, the abortion clinic, and the pornographic film, and may well have helped pave the way for all three.&quot;  Mr. Jones' contention that there is a direct cause-and-effect nexus between Picasso's more savage depictions (and rejections) of the human and, say, abortion clinics is manifest monomania.<br />The bottom line?

Mr. McInerny points the accusing finger (quite correctly) at dissenting -- indeed, heretical -- theologians who have demonstrated their intellectual, moral, and indeed theological bankruptcy by unconscionably rejecting the inarguable and absolute authority of the Magisterium, and setting themselves up as some sort of alternative authority -- an authority totally devoid of legitimacy.  The bottom line is that these theologians are apostates and secularists; men who have lost their faith and have become enemies of the Church.<br />Mr. McInerny also lays some of the blame (albeit obliquely and respectfully) at the feet of Paul VI and John Paul II.  He is understandably mystified and dismayed that there had been little vigorous action taken against heretical theologians until relatively recently; this, despite the fact that the heresy dates back more than 30 years.<br />Outside of the redundancies and the rather misleading title (as so many other reviewers have pointed out), my only criticism pertains to Mr. McInerny's suggestions for reversing the Church's decline.  He advises prayer and fasting -- essential activities, to be sure.  But there's much that can be done on the temporal plane -- e.g., becoming involved in traditional Catholic organizations.<br />I highly recommend this book, as well as the superb &quot;Trojan Horse in the City of God,&quot; by Dietrich von Hildebrand, as a companion piece.	2001-11-30

To be sure, Mr. Royal's heart is in the right place -- which is more than one can say for his writing skills. Is this book terribly written? By no means. Nevertheless, Mr. Royal has a rather pedestrian and awkward style. And there are some unbelievable errors: People are hanged, Mr. Royal, not hung. In addition, there are many passages that fizzle out, that never really go anywhere. And I had very little interest in the rather lenghty and tedious biographical information on several of the martyrs. Their martyrdom, the circumstances leading up to and surrounding it, and the ultimately beneficial results for the Church is where the focus should have been. Finally, Mr. Royal's selection of Marie-Michel Marcel Van surprised me -- &quot;At one point, Christ even asked Van to tell him some funny stories.&quot; Uh-huh. And the same is true of his selection of Archbishop Romero. Mr. Royal does not persuade that the Archbishop wasn't a Marxist wedded to Liberation Theology. The Archbishop was brutally murdered, to be sure. But was he also martyred? Did he die for the Faith or for a bankrupt ideology?<br />Despite these and other imperfections, I do indeed recommend this book -- it is something of a monument to those who paid the ultimate price or at least suffered greatly as witnesses to the Fullness of Truth.	2001-09-24

This is a must read for any and all interested in the men behind the executions; specifcally, in Albert Pierrepoint and England's other hangmen.  There are problems, however.  For example, Brian Bailey makes some egregious errors of fact, two of which are glaring:  First, Herman Goering's corpse was not hanged.  Second, Caryl Chessman died in San Quentin's gas chamber, not its (non-existent) electric chair.  Mr. Bailey's worst offense, however, is his self-righteous and drumbeat condemnations of the death penalty, and his condescending and nasty attitude toward those ignorant and barbaric enough to be proponents of the death penalty (a group of which I'm proud to be a member).  After all, Mr. Bailey's book is subtitled &quot;The History of Execution from Jack Ketch to Albert Pierrepoint,&quot; not &quot;The Death Penalty Has Been Repealed; How Smug I Am.&quot;  With these provisos in mind, the book is worth looking for, finding, and reading.	2001-07-07

I don't think this retreading, as it were, serves her or the reader particularly well.  Still, there's something to be said for Mrs. Cruz's vignette, rather than narrative, approach -- despite the redundancies, it makes for a read that is not only fast, easy, and enjoyable, but also informative.  <br />Recommended.	2001-07-02

The knee-jerk loathing of Joe McCarthy is so universal and deeply entrenched that it's not likely that Arthur Herman's effort to bring to book the intellectually dishonest and inform the historically ignorant will make much more than a dent -- hard-hitting and courageous though his effort is. <br />Mr. Herman has done an outstanding job of research and of articulating the results of his research for anyone open and curious enough to want to know the truth about Senator McCarthy and his times.  To be sure, the burly Wisconsin senator had his faults and made a lot more than one or two mistakes.  The true villains of the piece, however, were Soviet agents, home-bred Communist sympathizers, and addle-headed dupes.  Communism was a genuine and significant threat to the national security interests of the United States and to the American way of life.  Senator McCarthy and his allies made a significant contribution in bringing this threat to the attention of the American people and in battling it tooth and nail.  Those who denied the reality of Communist infiltration and subversion were fools or knaves; those who continue to deny that the Soviet Union and its American-born handmaidens ever constituted a danger must also be considered either fools or knaves.<br />I thank God for Senator Joe McCarthy, Francis Cardinal Spellman, and all those who fought the good fight.  If only we had men like that today, as our culture sinks ever deeper into a sewer of depravity.  I also thank God for Arthur Herman.  He has written an important book.  With a few insignificant caveats -- e.g., the editing leaves something to be desired -- I highly recommend it.	2001-06-22

First, the book is too long (by at least 150 pages, I would say) and becomes almost hopelessly bogged down toward the middle.  Indeed, although I'm glad I finished it, I was sorely tempted to chuck it all at around the halfway point.  There are too many characters, and too many secondary and tertiary events and encounters.  And the redundancies!  How many times must the reader slog his way through essentially the same meetings and discussions among amazingly articulate and evil cardinals and their secular allies?<br />As a staunch Catholic, I can say that while some of Malachi Martin's criticisms of the current state of the Church and of our beloved Holy Father, Pope John Paul II, are on target, he paints too bleak a picture.  Moreover, while the power of the Church is inarguable, I never bought into his contention that de-Catholicizing it would ensure absolute power to the New World Order.  Even if the Church could be rendered impotent (which I don't believe), what about the enormous and entrenched influence of Christian Fundamentalists and Muslims?  They're antithetical to the NWO, and yet Father Martin never addresses them. <br />As other reviewers have commented, the ending of &quot;Windswept House&quot; is distinctly ambivalent.  No criticism can be leveled here, as Father Martin died prior to his writing the planned sequel.  It says something about my attitude toward this book that I would have picked up the sequel -- but I would have braced myself before doing so.	2001-06-10

Second, in &quot;Mysterious America,&quot; Coleman devotes too much space to phantom felines and other cryptids.  I'm interested in cryptozoology, but there are already several books on the subject, including a decent one by Coleman and Clark, and an outstanding one by Karl Shuker.  Third, the lists at the end of the book are helpful, but excessive (arguably gratuitous).  Last, but not least, I'm sick and tired of Coleman's massive feelings of insecurity and inferiority, and the resultant overcompensating self-recognition and self-praise.

He certainly gives that impression as he meanders and whines his way through this bloated and panic-stricken attack on the Catholic Church.  It's open season on Catholics, and Carroll is the Elmer Fudd of Catholic-bashers.  For a former priest, his total lack of understanding and appreciation for the history of Roman Catholicism is amazing.  His suggestions for &quot;improving&quot; the Church are the equivalent of decatholicizing it; suggestions that are remarkable for their fatuity and destructiveness -- e.g., diminishing the importance of the Cross as a symbol of the Church, thereby ensuring that non-Catholics will breathe more easily around us.  Obscene and imbecilic!

Not Great, But Good	Brian Herne has done a an admirable job analyzing the excitement of big game hunting and the contributions white hunters and game wardens have made to the preservation of Africa's wildlife and their natural habitat.  I was also very impressed by his vivid, accurate and responsible depiction of the horrors of the Mau Mau uprising, a phenomenon that has been more or less whitewashed in recent years by politically correct pantywaists -- e.g., Edgerton.<br />I must say, however, that Mr. Herne's description of the hunt is not as lively as others I've read.  Ruark comes to mind, as does Capstick (whom Mr. Herne neglects to mention).  To be sure, Capstick can come across as a bit of a clown on occasion, but he's an adrenaline-pumping writer.  I wonder why Mr. Herne failed to mention him (and others -- e.g., Bull).  After all, virtually every white hunter there ever was is discussed in this book, which is arguably a mistake.  &quot;White Hunters&quot; is too long and so congested with characters that Mr. Herne loses sight of what should be the ultimate goal of such a book -- to get our adrenaline pumping.<br />I do recommend &quot;White Hunters,&quot; but I would have preferred a tighter, more focused and more exciting effort.	2000-11-26

My guess is that he wouldn't be overly surprised.<br />&quot;La-Bas&quot; is only nominally a novel.  After all, there's no progression toward a resolution.  This is hardly surprising, as there's no resolution.  Rather, &quot;La-Bas&quot; is an ongoing and in-depth discussion of Satanism that cleverly leads us to think deeply about the broader and deeper issue of man's brutish nature and the tawdry society stemming from that nature.  Indeed, the book should be retitled &quot;My Dinner with Carhaix.&quot;  I, for one, would have been delighted to have attended those dinners -- for both the scintillating conversation and the evocatively described suppers.

But Mr. Kellerman does not share his mentor's veritable genius for generating the extraordinary in terms of dialogue, introspection, and dynamics.  For example, Mr. Kellerman is obsessed with providing the most trivial and redundant descriptions of his characters' physical appearance, mannerisms, and dress.  And he seems to have an interior designer's fascination with color.  One character's jacket is the color of iced tea, and another's hand hairs the color of beer.<br />Most dismaying are the domestic scenes between Dr. Delaware and his wife, Robin, peppered throughout this preposterous (albeit reasonably entertaining) plot.  They are vomitable in their sugariness.

One, however, that never really goes anywhere, and  it's all pretty much ado about nothing.  The climax is anything but, and  the overall impression is as flaccid as one of Dali's timepieces.  There's  a lot more of &quot;gray&quot; than of &quot;noir&quot; about this novel.	2000-08-14
US	50788121	R2HVB7BLA9WKHL	0671017470	522231053	Rope: The Twisted Life and Crimes of Harvey Glatman	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Good Enough	Much better written, researched, and documented than most books of this type, Michael Newton does a very good job detailing the &quot;life and  crimes&quot; of the unappetizing Harvey Glatman.<br />As other reviewers have  pointed out, there are some redundancies.  And, yes, Glatman is only  moderately interesting (though let's not kid ourselves -- once you've read  about one of these weirdos, you've pretty much read about them all).  In  addition, there's way too much filler in this book.  There are numerous  examples, but I'll mention only a couple.<br />First:  At one point, Mr.  Newton describes the crimes of the exceptionally repulsive Melvin Rees.   Why?  What on earth does he have to do with Glatman?  Why not bring up  Penny Bjorkland while he's at it?  Carole Tregoff?  And let's not forget  good old Jack the Ripper.  <br />Second:  Many pages are devoted to the  history of Jewish immigration to the U.S.  This is an interesting topic,  nicely addressed by Mr. Newton, but it's completely irrelevant to the  Glatman case. <br />I'll add that I was a bit disappointed in not knowing what  happened to some of the key players -- Lorraine Vigil, for example.  And  when did Mrs. Glatman die?  And I was surprised that Mr. Newton didn't  quote, or even mention, Dr. David Abrahamsen, a forensic psychiatrist who  knew Glatman.<br />Despite all my belly-aching, this is the book to read if  you're interested in Glatman.  Why you should be (and why I was) is another  matter.<br />P.S.  Don't kid yourself that Glatman wasn't a sadist.  Sure he  was.  That's why he used a rope, instead of his gun.	2000-08-11

Second, Mr. Reynolds owes it to his  appreciative readers, as well as to himself, to provide  somewhat more  in-depth and revealing final thoughts than he has.  My final  &quot;gripe&quot; is admittedly extremely trivial.  It irritated me, though  -- in such a superbly researched endeavor, such a silly mistake should have  been easily avoided.  Hold on to your hats, ladies, because here it is:  At  one point, Mr. Reynolds mentions that Hemingway met Barbara Stanwyck and  her husband, Robert Montgomery.  Well, Robert Taylor, not Mr. Montgomery,  was Miss Stanwyck's husband.  A trivial mistake, to be sure, but why make  it?<br />Despite the mix-up with the Roberts (which can be easily made right  in future editions), this is an outstanding biography, which I heartily  recommend.	2000-08-03
US	50788121	R107HTZ5WCBENU	0880013850	188712994	On Boxing	Books	4	6	14	N	N	Of Champion Quality	Despite some pretentiousness, many redundancies, and an often poorly stitched together narrative, Joyce Carol Oates brings a scalpel-like insight to the incomparable phenomenon that is boxing.  She will deepen  your understanding -- and take your breath away.<br />I wonder what Miss Oates  thinks of the apparent growing popularity of female boxers (surely, the  oxymoron non pareil).  My guess is that she sees it  for precisely what it  is -- political correctness carried to its ultimate and inevitable fatuity.   A woman who boxes may be to drool over by lipstick lesbians, but she will  always be that absurd and grotesque anomaly -- a woman who boxes.  The one  thing she'll never be is a &quot;Boxer.&quot;<br />Perhaps another book will  be forthcoming from Miss Oates, one that will explore this perversion of  the &quot;Sweet Science.&quot;  My guess is not -- why waste time on the  ridiculous when, in &quot;On Boxing,&quot; she has spoken so well on what  is sublime.	2000-05-09
US	50788121	R3IQ2XUFHGOVDM	1561712884	904860469	Hollywood's Babylon Women	Books	1	20	24	N	Y	Garbage	Hollywood is arguably THE hotbed of sordid secrets, but this reality isn't enough to suit John Austin's bizarre and paranoid fantasies.  Most of his claims in this horrendously written and edited book are highly speculative and singularly devoid of documentation, unless one considers  a-source-who-can't-be-identified acceptable documentary evidence -- I do  not.  By the way, his chapter on Vicki Morgan is particularly  ludicrous.<br />In addition, Mr. Austin comes across as a pompous weirdo,  usually referring to himself as &quot;we&quot; and to Hollywood's power  structure as the &quot;oligarchy.&quot;  I'm also confused by his negative  attitude toward the Reagan Administration, while paradoxically ranting  about liberals.<br />Oh, avoid this book as though it were contaminated by  every communicable disease known to man.	2000-05-03

Do we really need to know that she perceived sex as  nothing more than an itch that just about anyone could scratch?  Is a root  cause of her singular unhappiness her inability to relate sex to love,  romance, or even true passion?<br />In addition, Mr. Clarke doesn't always  make a whole lot of sense in discussing Miss Garland's sex life.  He  states, for example, that she wasn't a lesbian or a &quot;bisexual&quot;  (whatever that is), but that she did have sex with women.  Well, what  better definition of lesbianism can one find than one woman having sex with  another? <br />It should also be noted that other students of Miss Garland's  life disagree with Mr. Clarke's interpretation of her attitude toward sex .   I've read that her interest in &quot;The Act&quot; was rather minimal,  that what there was was sapphic, and that she was a fruitfly -- i.e., what  little interest she showed in men was in homosexual men.<br />Who knows?   Nobody, really.  And that's the point.<br />On the plus side, this book is  chock-full of other, more interesting, and better documented aspects of  Miss Garland's life -- one both tragic and triumphant.	2000-04-06

To be sure, &quot;Crime Wave&quot; isn't in the same league as the L.A. quartet, but it's vastly superior to the singularly overrated &quot;American  Tabloid.&quot;<br />I'm curious:  Where on earth does Ellroy get his Kenneth  Anger-like information?  For instance, I've never heard that Lana Turner  and Ava Gardner &quot;liked to lez once in a soft sapphic moon&quot;  (though apparently not with each other).  Fact?  Fiction?  Fantasy?  What  tidbit will appear in Ellroy's next book?  Jayne Mansfield romancing a  Great Dane?	2000-03-22

(In addition to &quot;The Guns of Navarone,&quot; do read &quot;Ice-Station Zebra&quot; and  &quot;Night Without End,&quot; for example).  This undeniable talent makes  for a riveting and enjoyable read.  Indeed, these books can and should be  reread numerous times over the years.  This, despite the fact that MacLean  stinks in all other writing aspects.<br />His preposterous and one-dimensional  characters are easily interchangeable from book to book (by the way, the  same is true of his awful and tedious dialogue).  In particular, his  protagonists share the same characteristics, most of them unattractive,  regardless of which book you pick up.  To be sure, they are all courageous  and resourceful (and why shouldn't they be?), but they also are  self-righteous, sickeningly sentimental, and not very bright.  Worst of all  is their artifical (or at least badly portrayed, sledge hammer)  world-weariness.  Is this what MacLean was like?  Is that why he imprints  these undesirable traits on his characters?  I don't know.  What I do know  is that, despite it all, he's an irresistible read.	2000-03-22

Oh, to be sure, John Banville's language can be absurd and pretentious, and I found the occasional mundane vulgarity startling, jarring, and  gratuitous... but hardly ruinous.  I heartily recommend this book.	2000-03-06

This, despite an absurd and annoying writing style (at least in this book).  I  suspect that Dr. Shuker is trying to be amusing and clever, but his style  is only coy and distracting.  Too much alliteration, too much emphasis on  Latinate language, and a veritable obsession with the word  &quot;conversely.&quot;  Memo to Dr. Shuker:  You're the goods, so cut out  the pompous nonsense.	2000-03-03

Virginia Bell was singularly unattractive and has been justifiably forgotten; Cynthia Myers  was an overrated and depraved doxy, ideal for the usually vulgar Hugh  Hefner and the always vulgar Russ Meyers; Sabrina was, at best, a  third-tier entertainer; and I've never understood why Sheree North was  considered even remotely attractive.  The book is saved, at least to some  degree, by the chapters on more interesting women -- e.g., Yvette  Vickers.<br />Sullivan's criteria for his selection is a mystery.  To be sure,  there are glamorous women other than Monroe and Mansfield worth writing  about, and they can be from the second tier, such as Sue Ane Langdon.  But  why focus on what amounts to the bottom of the barrel?  A pity.	2000-02-28

Steve Sullivan introduces the reader to (or reminds him of) such legendary glamour girls as Clara Bow, Jean Harlow, Marilyn Monroe, and Jayne Mansfield.  In addition, Mr. Sullivan hasn't neglected  such less well-known lovelies as Barbara Nichols.<br />Now, for the bad news,  which outweighs the good.  There aren't 1,000 glamour girls -- one would be  hard pressed to find 100 truly worthy of the title.  Equally misguided is  Mr. Sullivan's gratuitous and hopelessly arbitrary attempt to rate these  women in descending order.  Why not just list them chronologically?  Last,  but not least, Mr. Sullivan's assessment of what glamour is leaves an  enormous amount to be desired.  For example, what on earth is Madonna, that  apotheosis of vulgarity, doing in a book about glamour girls?  And what's  with including porn stars, who are the very antithesis of glamour?<br />Too  bad, because it could have been so good.	2000-02-15

And this coming from someone who has a fair familiarity with and appreciation for Japanese literature.  Despite the book's short length, it took me several weeks to get through it -- my interest and intellectual  curiosity were never truly aroused.  I was particularly dismayed by the  stories' endings, which struck me as rather arbitrary and gratuitously  abrupt.  To be sure, it is nowhere written in stone that a story must  always provide some sort of resolution.  That doesn't mean, however, that  it should end more or less in mid-sentence -- and with a 'ho-hum' from the reader.	2000-02-14
US	50788121	R39XC60GBBQ747	0962653438	21305186	The Mothman Prophecies	Books	2	2	8	N	N	Disappointing	The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one.  Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to &quot;The Mothman Prophecies.&quot;  John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and  Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves.  I  was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black)  behaving badly.<br />I've given this singularly overrated book two stars,  rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near  enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years  ago.	2000-01-30

Despite its short length, it becomes quite silly and boring after a while.  And the inept, juvenile  redundancies!  How many times must the reader be subjected to descriptions  of whiskey being drunk, spilled or thrown across a room?  Who does Matheson  think he is, Charles Jackson?<br />Comparatively speaking, this book is  inferior to Matheson's very good &quot;Hell House,&quot; but superior to  his awful &quot;Now You See It.&quot;<br />As for the stories in &quot;I Am  Legend&quot; -- they are singularly amateurish and sophomoric, and I don't  know how I got through them.  If they constituted the book, without the  presence of the novella, my rating would fall to one star.<br />The bottom  line?  Younger readers will enjoy this book, but more sophisticated and  experienced ones will be less than thrilled.	1999-12-17

The good judge has sounded  a clarion call -- loud and clear.  Do we have the courage and wisdom to  heed it?  <br />Highly recommended.	1999-11-25
