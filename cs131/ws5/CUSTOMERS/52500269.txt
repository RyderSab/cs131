There are areas where radio reception is \\"take what you can get.\\" At one point, I pulled in a station that featured a syndicated show called &lt;I>Delilah&lt;/I>. With a perky voice, a laugh, and a few giggles, this lady takes calls from listeners who ask for a special song for a special somebody. It was quite uplifting.<br />Recently, in driving to and from Indianapolis with my wife we again pulled in a station playing &lt;I>Delilah&lt;/I>. My wife has become hooked on it and has found a station in Milwaukee (Light 97.3) that plays &lt;I>Delilah&lt;/I> every evening.<br />One day, while in the local bookstore that also sells used books, I came across this volume. I thought my wife would like it so I paid the few dollars they were asking for it and surprised her with this gift. She has enjoyed it.<br />Eventually I decided to read it. And it is a very interesting book.<br />The layout of chapters follows Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (if you don't know this particular passage, think The Byrds and their classic \\"Turn, Turn, Turn.\\" Delilah was also kind enough to include the passage at the front of her book).  She divides the chapters up for each \\"time,\\" beginning with \\"A Time to be Born.\\" The book is subtitled \\"Encouragement and Inspiration for the Times of Our Lives.\\"<br />But the book isn't autobiographical as it is an extension of her show. You won't get a chronology of her life her. In \\"A Time to be Born\\" she talks about her \\"Kissy Baby\\" she had as a child and her prayer that the doll become real. She then seques into giving birth to her own children and the different reactions she had to each conception and birth (my contention in being pro-life is that a woman who has had more than one child has different memories of each pregnancy and each child was different in the womb. If the \\"fetus\\" were just an extension of the mother's body, I don't believe these differences would exist).<br />She follows that with \\"A Time to Die,\\" just as Ecclesiastes does. It might seem strange in its order, but this book pulls it off wonderfully. The mourning of the loss of life stands in stark contrast to the giving of birth.<br />Not every \\"time\\" in Ecclesiastes is used. Delilah does not include \\"A time to kill, and a time to heal,\\" even though this could be personal growth. \\"A time for war and a time of peace\\" might not be politically correct, but is very relevant today. There are others not used-maybe Delilah will bless us with a follow-up volume?<br />Not to say that she can't. Delilah has used listener stories in her book as a connection between her, her audience, and her readers. She also concludes each chapter with an original poem to display her skills as a poetess. And in the last few months in this year 2003 many military families have called Delilah's show and shared their stories and hopes and fears. So, Delilah, can we see a completion of Ecclesiastes sometime soon?<br />I would recommend this book for Mothers' Day or as a gift for someone special. My wife has read it several times now.Die,\\" just as Ecclesiastes does. It might seem strange in its order, but this book pulls it off wonderfully.

It was noted the San Quentin Giants only played home games.<br />Leonard \\"Oakie\\" Brumm published this book in December 2001. Maybe he should attempt to collect from the above stated venues for stealing his idea and \\"only home games\\" line. Those pieces ran well after Oakie Brumm's book.<br />Leonard \\"Oakie\\" Brumm is a respected high school hockey coach in the Milwaukee area. My father-in-law claims to know him. It's possible, as both men come from Michigan's Upper Peninsula--an area where hockey is a major sport and the fanaticism of hockey fans exceeds even the fanaticism found in Minnesota.<br />But the book is about a job Oakie Brumm had for four years in Marquette, Michigan (a major UP city). The book details Oakie's tenure as Recreation Director for the Marquette State Prison, a maximum security facility. Oakie was hired a year after the Jackson State Prison riot in downstate Michigan. The Warden at Marquette wanted to prevent the same scenario to play out in Marquette. Thus, the hiring of Brumm as recreation director.<br />You might ask what would incite a sane individual to apply for such a job. The truth is, the job came looking for Brumm. Brumm had coached in Alaska and Wyoming previously, which the warden knew. Brumm had come back to Marquette to work in his family's construction business. And it was while doing road work that the warden would stop and ask Brumm to apply for the job; it was his for the taking.<br />Brumm was naturally hesitant to take the job. Who in their right mind wants to work inside a maximum security facility? But his wife urged him to take the job. Women love job security and financial security and working for the state in maximum security wasn't bad.<br />This was indeed a special job. Brumm reported only to the warden. He was told never to tattle on the prisoners to the guards (\\"screws\\"). Brumm needed to win the prisoners' trust if he was going to get them to co-operate. As the warden stated, \\"If the screws can't catch them, we'll get more screws.\\"<br />The job also was tailor-made for a \\"self-starter.\\" There was no job description and no agenda and no direction. The warden had never hired a recreation director before and had no idea where Brumm should start.<br />And certainly politics and bureaucracy come into play. Some activities, such as miniature golf, are viewed as turning the prison into a country club. And the deputy warden warns Oakie, \\"Just make sure no one kills someone with those clubs.\\" The bureaucratic irony comes when the assistant deputy warden tells Brumm, \\"Get some more clubs.\\" Seems miniature golf had become so popular that many complained they couldn't get time on the course. It is also ironic that baseball bats were already on the grounds, but bringing golf clubs into the prison was seen as dangerous.<br />Oakie Brumm writes with candor and honesty and openness. He doesn't sugar coat and he tells what life inside the prison was like, even the details of \\"prison love.\\" Brumm uses the language of the prison in his book. But don't fear about not knowing the language; Brumm includes a \\"Glossary of Marquette Prison Terms.\\" Read through the glossary before reading the book for a better understanding while reading the book. One caution I would make is that if you don't wish for your children to know about the harsh realities in life, or in prison life, you may want to monitor their reading of this book or at the very least be willing to discuss and concerns or questions they have while reading this book. Brumm is frank and forthright in his relaying not only the games played inside the prison with rules and regulations and scores kept, but also the games cons played in all areas of prison life. While such frankness may be shocking, it is an untainted portrait of life inside a wall where all games, competitive or not, intramural or inter-institutional, are all \\"home games.\\" This book is an education in the realities of life in prison and of those serving time in prison.<br />(Originally published on BookIdeas.com.)mes.\\" This book is an education in the realities of life in prison and of those serving time in prison. <br />(Originally published on BookIdeas.com.)	2002-07-18

Even as we work we set aside funds for retirement and pay premiums for life insurance (which is paid out when we die, after life has left our bodies). We take great pains to avoid situations that could result in an untimely death.<br />And in this scenario, we have certain expectations. A parent should not have to bury a dead child.<br />But it happens.<br />A challenge in reviewing a book of this nature is that it touches on a subject I am unfamiliar with-having to survive a child's death. If I pan the book, I'm heartless and cruel. Praise it effusively and I'm pandering.<br />What I can say is that the emotions are real. The grief is real. The reactions of parents, friends, family, and acquaintances is real. Ms. Tompkins pours her soul into this book. Perhaps this was her therapy, to write down how she felt, what she felt, the emotions as she first heard that her daughter was in a fatal car accident, then the funeral preparations and the funeral itself. But the grieving doesn't stop even if the mourners cease to come. The emptiness continues. Even when the family moves to a new home.<br />In the process we get a peak into Patricia's thoughts on the circumstances. There is her anger at the tree being cut down where her daughter died (not even a notification of the action so that survivors could retrieve mementos left behind by friends). Or the court case of the drunk driver driving the car in which Erinn was killed. Seems he had been drinking and smoking marijuana, with his parents' knowledge. Their penalty? By pleading \\"no contest\\" they received misdemeanor fines and no culpability for civil suits. As Ms. Tompkins puts it: \\"I could not believe that the circumstances under which these kids were killed were no more substantial then [sic] stealing rocks from state property, poisoning the neighbor's dog, using improper language in the presence of women or children, or possessing a fawn without a permit, just to mention a few.\\" And while awaiting trial, the driver was free from jail on bond, with a stipulation that he be given daily drug and sobriety tests and must be home at all times except between 9AM and 5PM. As Ms. Tompkins shares: \\"He walked the streets, and my daughter was dead.\\"<br />Patricia also grew during this experience. On first meeting with the mother of another victim (three teens died in the crash), she felt the other woman was loud and obnoxious. In their joint grief they became close friends.<br />Holidays are also especially trying to Ms. Tompkins-Christmas and other family times with a family member missing. Another trying challenge is the local paper and the letters to the editor column. That and the TV news getting Erinn's name wrong. But it is in the letters to the editor section that people vent and speak without knowing of which they speak. As you can imagine, the driver who was drunk and stoned was held by some to be the victim. And while he may be the victim of the memory of what he had done (no doubt trying to erase it with more alcohol and drugs), at least he's still seeing daylight and can still pursue dreams.<br />It was difficult to read this book. My wife grabbed it first when it first came and wouldn't let go until she was finished. This is important for this fact: my wife is not known as a reader! For her to be engrossed in a book says something about this book.<br />It was also hard to read because of the emotion. I hope I never have to endure what Ms. Tompkins endured. And if God calls my son home, I hope I have the same grace and dignity Ms. Tompkins possessed.<br />I thoroughly recommend reading this book not just once, but several times. If you have lost a child, you will empathize with the Tompkins family. And while those of us who have not lost children can never know what they are going through or feeling, we can at least get a glimpse of their suffering. &lt;P...waiting trial, the driver was free from jail on bond, with a stipulation that he be given daily drug and sobriety tests and must be home at all times except between 9AM and 5PM.

One of Cahill's strengths that I enjoy  is his method of weaving historical events together so that you know from  whence the main theme of his book arrived.<br />A weakness in Cahill's books,  however, is his reliance upon those in the historical-critical (liberal)  camp on matters of theology and belief. At times it would be preferable if  Cahill either stated what the various scholars believe concerning certain  beliefs, or just not comment on the religious aspects and focus solely on  history.	2000-06-29

There is a  numbing shock when these words are heard--thoughts fly wildly by, unable to  be caught or captured.<br />This book is a book of poems written by a young  man who was told, in his 30's, that he only had months to live. The results  take the reader through the grieving process of the person looking at his  own mortality. Emotions rang from anger to denial to acceptance. The words  are powerful; the emotions real.<br />Anyone who's experienced this firsthand  will no doubt relate to the words, feelings, and emotions of Matthew  Oickle. Anyone who knows someone with a terminal illness can begin to  understand what's happening through Matthew's experiences and words. Anyone  who's had to counsel both can use this for his/her own understanding and  maybe to help in the grieving process, to show that the feelings of fear,  anger, hatred, acceptance. love, etc., are normal to the process.<br />You  will not want to miss the exchange in the book between Matthew and his  niece. It is to be treasured for its simplicity and its eloquence and its  acceptance of what is happening and leaving it up to a higher power.<br />In  the short time I've known about this book, it has helped tremendously in  counseling people not only with terminal illness, but other suffering as  well.	2000-06-23

Whitney Von Lake Hopler has just released her first novel, a self-published effort entitled Wild Canvass. Overall, I enjoyed the book (and I'm not one to read novels). Ms. Von Lake Hopler has a style  reminiscent of Janette Oke, a Christian novelist who sets her novels on the  American and Canadian frontiers.<br />First, a few weaknesses. Chapter one had  a strong, vibrant start. It proceeds at a good pace and keeps the reader's  interest. But the beginning of chapter two bogged down. I feel this was  because of how Ms. Von Lake Hopler attempted to fill in background  information about the main character, Alison Reilly. Some of the detail  could have been eliminated; if Alison graduated from college and is an  artist, we don't really need to know it was a small college and she got her  liberal arts degree. That is usually a given. Sometimes the background  information could have been placed better. In a later chapter we learn that  Alison had traveled around the world, but she confides in her boyfriend  that moving to a strange locale isn't the same as visiting it. That could  have been brought forward to the beginning of the book and give us an  insight to Alison's challenge of moving from Pennsylvania to Montana. At  another place, she asks a family friend to help her get ready for an art  show. It is while planning that Alison learns her helper had been a member  of the art league in Dallas. Alison's character would have more meaning if  she had been pre-occupied with the show and she was offered the help  because the friend had been an art patron elsewhere.<br />This was the only  place where I felt the action slowed. The pace of the rest of the book was  well done!<br />But enough nit-picking. There are some shining moments in this  book. Chapter 10 starts: &quot;An intimate relationship without love is  nothing more than a form of exploitation by consent.&quot; In a sentence  employing a chiastic construction, Ms. Von Lake Hopler sums up the turmoil  involved in casual sex!<br />Later in the book, the contrast of Alison's  attack in the woods and her friend, Ginger's, battle to say no to her  married boyfriend's marriage proposal is superb. The action switches from  one incident to the other, giving the reader both the sense of the  simultaneous timing of the two events and the similar nature of them, one  being a concrete battle while the other is a more &quot;abstract&quot;  (though no less real) battle.<br />Alison's effort to find who she is, how her  talents in art will serve her, and her emotional turbulence with the two  men in the story are adeptly explored. Alison does not come across as a  saint, but she learns and grows. Ms. Von Lake Hopler has done a good job on  her first novel; I await future novels. I highly recommend it for children.  It's also a good read for adults.<br />The title is very apt for this book, as  it reflects not only the main character's love of painting, but the Great  Painter's brush strokes in each of our lives.in casual sex!<br />Later in the book, the contrast of Alison's  attack in the woods and her friend, Ginger's, battle to say no to her  married boyfriend's marriage proposal is superb.

US	52500269	R1T6IX8NAELYCW	0394709624	707032291	Wisconsin death trip	Books	5	22	23	N	N	Taking a look at an era not unlike our own	At the end of the nineteenth century and up through World War II, sociologists debated human behavior and intelligence. Are people born predisposed to genius or moronity? Are they born with a genetic ability to be or become wealthy and others are born to be poor? Can one's environment affect one's intelligence and one's station in life, or is it a genetic quality?<br /> Leading advocates of both positions certainly used a great deal of research to prove one point or another. Ironically, a leading advocate of the environmental influences of behavior eventually went into advertising, the greatest proof of environmental influences on individuals. And, in another bit of irony, Adolf Hitler influenced his audiences with propaganda to lead them to believe race and genetics determined who and what people were!<br /> Michael Lesy's scholarly work (it was originally a thesis for his degree) takes a practical look at this debate. In fact, Mr. Lesy addresses that debate in his conclusion, as he relates the debates raging in ivory towers, his book in the main related the reality of the world in the heartland. These men in academia might not have known of the individuals who are named in the news reports, but their debate sought to answer those question that arose from these actions.<br /> In reading these accounts, we realize that the only difference between &quot;the good ol' days&quot; and today is likely the speed of communications. Many of these articles were already several days, if not weeks, old when they printed; today they would be splashed on the front pages and people would debate what is happening to our society that it is eroding so. Attempts on others lives were frequent. Mental illness prevalent.<br /> The photographs also tell a story. Infant mortality. Newlyweds looking to a bright future. Vibrant businesses. Artistic photographs that seek to illuminate certain features of a photo. These glass plate photos were what originally inspired Mr. Lesy to do this project.<br /> Amazingly, these accounts are not from the large metropolitan areas, but from the rural areas of Wisconsin. At this same period, Wisconsin was the leader in Progressivism with Robert &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; LaFollette leading the state to lead the nation in enacting reforms such as Social Security, Worker's Compensation, and the minimum wage. So while the environment improved, the sad state of human affairs remained similar to the nation at large.<br /> This book also proves to be a conversation piece. After reading it, I started bringing it to family gatherings. My grandmother remembered similar stories from her youth. My mother read similar accounts as she did geneology. Others were amazed that news reports then are eerily similar to news reports today. Obviously, the human condition remains bizarely similar. The &quot;good ol' days&quot; it would appear weren't so good.ct.<br /> Amazingly, these accounts are not from the large metropolitan areas, but from the rural areas of Wisconsin.

US	52500269	RD08QRMMB5DZR	0806613106	466205659	The Hammer of God	Books	5	69	69	N	Y	Excellent Stories of Three Pastors	&quot;Hammer of God&quot; is set in Sweden, when the Swedish Lutheran Church was struggling for its identity. There were many who felt that the &quot;rigid/dead orthodoxy&quot; no longer served a purpose in people's lives. Naturally, nature abhors a vacuum. In place of orthodoxy came two schools of thought: rationalism (scientific thought) and pietism. This masterful volume follows three recent seminary graduates serving their first parishes. Obviously, their mentors are of the &quot;dead orthodoxy&quot; bent. The young pastors feel that the people should be more scientific or live more perfect lives. Needless to say, the new approaches do not work out. Touching is the old soldier, in the throes of senility, barking out fighting orders and using profanity. The young pastor soon realizes that it is by God's grace that we are saved, not in building a better life to become more perfect. This book was required reading at a small Lutheran seminary I attended in Mankato, MN (as was Walther's &quot;The Proper Distinction Between Law and Gospel.&quot;). I will forever be indebted to the professor who required us to read this book. It was very enlightening and graphically displayed Christian faith in action in everyday life.	1998-01-08

Col Wilmer McClean, seeking to escape the fighting after the First Battle at Bull Run, moved to Southern Virginia and settled in Appomattox. Little did he know the fighting would eventually follow him--and end with the meeting of Grant and Lee in his front parlor.  Minutiae and the smaller aspects of the Great War Between the States is all documented in this rather small volume. This is not a stale treatment of those lesser-known facts of the Civil War, but a lively telling of those incidents and thoughts on the Great American Schism. It is hard to put the book down once you start reading it. A must read.	1998-01-02

Many know of William Crapo Durant and his creation, the colossial General Motors Corporation. Romanced today are the stories of the Stanley brothers and their steamer and the Studebakers and their cars. But few know of the man who established the Chrysler Corporation from the ruins of the Maxwell-Chambers Auto Works, then bought out the much larger Dodge Brothers Motor Co. This book is a must-read for automotive enthusiasts. Walter Chrysler writes an anecdotal and easy-reading autobiography. He doesn't waste time defending himself against any rumors that may have persisted about him at the time of its writing. He doesn't needlessly spill ink on accusations of others. He merely tells his story about growing up, working on the railroads, turning around financially strapped American Locomotive, hired by Durant to turn Buick's fortunes around, then hired by the bancruptcy trustees to save Maxwell-Chambers. Soon, the cars this company put out bore Chrysler's own name and the rest is history. Chrysler writes about his belief that Research and Development are the vital elements to the success of any company (a section every corporate officer should read today). He also talks about the plans to build the Chrysler Building and, even, making his children work their way up in the company starting at the bottom--no doubt teaching his children that every job has a function and every individual has dignity and value. The best anecdote that Walter Chrysler tells is how he drove his first car--but I'll let you read that for yourself!	1997-12-08

But several key issues proved this wrong: America had already been making war material for Lend/Lease and the aircraft carriers the Japanese were hoping would be at Pearl Harbor were not at Pearl Harbor. Midway would be the turning point in the war and this book gives a chronology to the events leading up to the battle and the battle itself. This battle, more than any before it, would affirm the place of aviation in battle. The battleships in this battle never saw each other, much less fight each other. In the battle, America sustained damaged to its carrier fleet, while Japan took a huge hit upon its carrier forces. This would set the tone for the rest of the Pacific Theater, as the author succintly points out. The Japanese had to have islands to fly and refuel aircraft; the Americans still had their mobile, floating aircraft islands. A must read for anyone who wants to know the turning point in the Pacific Theatre in WWII.	1997-12-08

C.F.W. Walther, president of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and also president of Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, MO, presented a series of &quot;lectures&quot; on the proper distinction between Law and Gospel. This book is the compilation of those lectures. Walther never intended that these be published; however, his students felt that the contents of Walther's lectures was too good to be ignored. Gathering together their notes, they put together this volume which is still a primary resource for pastors today. It is worth your while to read this book and to look at the basics of the Christian faith.	1997-12-05

While Chicago would be the last place one would go to find a whale (outside captivity), there was a team by that name at the turn of the century. I enjoyed this book as both a baseball fan and a historian. One fault that I do find, however, is the absence of the Negro Leagues. Maybe this oversight can be corrected in a future edition or even in a separate compendium. Also, while mention is made of the original Milwaukee Brewers AL franchise in 1903 in the St. Louis Browns entry, there is no separate entry listed for that particular franchise. The 1903 Brewers had as colorful a year as the 1969 Seattle Pilots (which themselves became the modern day Milwaukee Brewers).	1997-12-05

Thus Robert Brent Toplin solicited and gathered responses from several historians, some who agree with Burns' methodology and some who disagree. What emerges is a portrait not only of a war that divided our nation over slavery in the 1860's, but a war that continues to divide us as we seek to define and explain that war. Of interest was the editor's thesis that each age looks at the Civil War through it's experiences and times: WWI era saw the Civil War as a silly regional conflict, much as they viewed WWI; WWII era saw the Civil War as a battle between good and evil and the start of civil rights. Today, we view war as a waste in the aftermath of Vietnam and that is reflected in our contemporary views of the 1860's conflict. That viewpoint is seen in Burns' epic.	1997-12-04

This book gives glimpses of the rumors coming backj to America about Hitler's Germany (this book was written in the 1930's; Ferber wrote a sequel autobiography after the war which displays great bitterness about the events in Central Europe during the 1940's). No doubt the title is taken from the Old Testament, when the Israelites are chosen to be &quot;a peculiar people.&quot; Ferber was indeed a peculiar treasure in the literary world, but an enjoyable treasure to read. In this book, Ferber recounts how she started as a reporter or the Appleton Post-Crescent (once even interviewing Harry Houdini, a fellow Appleton, WI, native ands fellow Jew). She also relates her trials as one of the first female reporters for the Milwaukee, WI, Journal and her rise as a novelist. For aspiring writers (like myself), Edna tells how she goes about writing and the regimen she maintained to write her books.	1997-12-04

Indeed, Davis does it with exquisite skill. Of course, by reading and quoting Lincoln, no doubt Mr. Davis realized, as Lincoln did, that some humor was needed to break the agony and tension surrounding this awful conflict. After reading this book, I went back to watch the Ken Burns' series on the Civil War--and noticed that this great work also used humor, especially those ironic or sardonic comments written by soldiers who were involved in the conflict firsthand.	1997-12-04

The man who led the Dolphins to this pinnacle? Don Shula, who was coach of the year numerous times in his seven year stint as Baltimore Colts' coach. This book is a personal look, as only an autobiography can be, of a coach who only desire was to be the best. Along the way there were hurdles--his mother's adamance against Shula playing football; heartaches--retirement as a player at age 27, the loss to the Jets in Super Bowl III and to the Cowboys in Super Bowl VI, the souring of his relationship with then-Colt owner Carroll Rosenbloom; and the highlights--making Paul Brown's Cleveland Brown squad as a rookie after Cleveland's World Championship season and the 1972 season. This book is a must read to learn about the coach who was the first to lead a team to the Super Bowl three straight seasons, the first to take two franchises to the Super Bowl, the only coach to appear in the Super Bowl in three different decades, has the most Super Bowl appearances of any coach, is the all-time winningest coach in professional football history, and the only coach who can say he coached a team during an undefeated season.	1997-12-04
