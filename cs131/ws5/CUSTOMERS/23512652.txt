Saying that Gerick had too many issues to just leave it at and working with them turned this series from great to incredible.  <br /> <br />For those who have come to love Berg's world-building, excellent plot twists, and outstanding characters, this book will not disappoint. D'Sanya is quite the enigmatic character, and watching her story unfold is absolutely relishing. Expect some heartbreak for some characters (but fans of Berg know that it doesn't always have to have a happy ending). And finally, Gerick has truly come full circle as a character, miles ahead from the snotty introverted brat he was when we first met him.  <br /> <br />For any fantasy fan, this series is a must-have. I promise that you can really go out and buy them all, knowing that these books end just as well as they start. Carol Berg is a superb author, and I am eagerly looking forward to her next series.	2005-09-19

Her books are filled with violence, irritating male characters, and various one-sided characters. But her stories and her wolds are absolutely incredible.  <br /> <br />Pilgrim is no exception. Every time one of the Wayfarer books comes out, I hope and pray that Axis will stop acting like a jerk. Still hasn't happened, and with only one book to go, I don't think it will. But to counteract him, we've got the awesome Faraday (fans- she plays a big part here, woohoo!) and the ever-suprising Drago. Zenith is shoved in the background, complaining about how prudish she is, and Wolfstar (thank god) grumbles while following people around and only contributing a small part in the events.  <br /> <br />Although I swear the violence got even worse in this book, if you've liked Douglass' books up til now you should enjoy \\"Pilgrim.\\" As usual, she leaves lots of cliffhangers for you to wring your hands at and tempt you to buy the Australian version. But just a warning- anything you didn't like that you'd hope Douglass would change, probably didn't.	2005-09-19

Based partially on Cinderella and other favorite fairy tales, this book shows what happens when some of these stories go awry.  <br /> <br />The story starts off well, but starts to slow down when Elena becomes an apprentice Godmother and is learning about The Tradition (the magic behind the fairy tales). Things are over-explained and confusing, not to mention mostly unnecessary. But about halfway the story picks up again and finishes well.  <br /> <br />There is no real serious drama in this book- nothing life-threatening for our main characters. Since this is based off od fairy tales, however, this seems completely appropriate and the plot is definetly enjoyable. The only thing I felt was a little fake was the prince's (Alexander) complete turnaround from being an insufferable jerk to pleasant and thoughtful man. Overall though the book is good, and great for a light read.	2005-08-25

Marillier weaves fact and fiction so well that she'd make Dan Brown shake in his boots. The description is vivid and lush, and the plot is exciting and moving.  <br /> <br />The best feature by far are the two main characters: Tuala and Bridei. Bridei at first may seem one sided, so devoted to his studies as well as stoic in his behavior. But he is well balanced with Tuala, who is more wild and ethereal. I found it perfectly reasonable that this pair were two halves of a whole.  <br /> <br />From the popularity of her previous books and the amazing manner this book was written in, I think its safe to assume that this whole series will captivate and entrance readers. But since there's a while til \\"Blade of Fortrui\\" will be released, I'll settle with everyone giving this first book a read.	2005-08-16

The first two were impeccable, in my opinion, and I expected no less from \\"Harshini.\\" Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed.  <br /> <br />R'Shiel continues to act like a spoiled brat (I was so hoping for more development there), and I can't understand any of the motivation behind anything she does. Tarja inexplicably does a three-sixty when he loses the spell of love thing cast on him. He doesn't even have any brotherly feelings for R'Shiel anymore, something I find hard to believe.  <br /> <br />The end was a little anticlimactic as well, and it seemed like Fallon was making an effort to make the end more realistic even though you know what is going to happen in the end. The only true redeeming part in this book was the antics of Damin and Adrina.  <br /> <br />Maybe this was a case of high expectations, but in any case I don't think that this book continued with the excellence of the previous two. Not bad by any means, just a disappointment to me.	2005-08-14

Its true that the \\"twists\\" weren't too difficult to figure out, but in my opinion the storytelling itself outshone all of that. There were a lot of characters presented, but it's obvious when reading that they are not important.  <br /> <br />In the beginning I was immediately reminded of the \\"Silmarillion,\\" but fortunately that stopped about two pages in. And as for teenage fiction, apparantly this book is classified as Young Adult (or, at least, her previous books were written for that age group). There's plenty of good YA fantasy out there, and I don't see it as a bad thing.  <br /> <br />In reality though, this book isn't for everyone. If you absolutely hate predictability, don't pick this up. But if you are looking for a good story, I think this book was wonderful. Baird's descriptions were vivid, and she did a good job intertwining her own imagination with other mythical elements.	2005-08-04

Either way, I got more than I bargained for in this book. Having read previous Luna books, I expected it to be more of a romance novel than a fantasy series. True, the romance is there, but nothing compared to other books I have read.<br /><br />Asaro's ideas of magic with shapes and colors seemed a little goofy at first (the obsession with both earlier in the novel wasn't explained, and made me wonder). I'm not sure I would call it groundbreaking, but interesting nonetheless. As pointed out before, the romance was also a little bit hard to believe between the two main characters. The other couple in the book was a little more realistic.<br /><br />The plot itself had little to do with the romance, but the usual \\"saving the kingdom from evil invaders,\\" with your token bad guy. It was well-executed though, and pleasantly paced. I was left thinking Asaro could have used a little bit more character development though (predictable actions, etc).<br /><br />If you're looking for a more light fantasy read, this book is very enjoyable. For those looking for more of a romance element, this book has only slightly more than your usual fantasy. And if you're waiting to read this when \\"Misted Cliffs\\" comes out in mass market paperback, don't worry- its only a sequel in the sense thats its the next generation (no waiting dying to find out what happens next).	2005-08-04

I don't read contemporary romance very often, but I just had to get this one since it had an archaeologist in it (my chosen career). Although it was a wee bit off in the Egyptology department, I didn't mind.  <br /> <br />The story is more of a Hollywood type of plot, with danger lurking around every corner kind of thing. But that was one of the things that made it so fun. The sexual tension between the two characters was great, too. I can't resist those geeky-yet-seductive male leads.  <br /> <br />At times the dialogue was a little campy, and the female lead (Cassie) was definetely on the goofy side. I loved the fact that the plot could hold its own outside of the romance, but I still got my romance craving. Definetly a worthwile read.	2005-08-04

Not bogged down in sexual exploits like most romantic novels, this book has a good fantasy plot with enough romance to satisfy your cravings.  <br /> <br />The story can be somewhat predictable, and a little cliche with the whole \\"thought I was a commoner but I'm actually a queen\\" thing, but that didn't really bother me, since I wasn't looking for a breakthrough epic fantasy story. The plot can be dramtic and exciting at times too, so I practically whizzed through this book.  <br /> <br />\\"Wizard's Ward\\" is a case of what you're looking for that will affect your opinion on it. If, like me, you were just looking for a nice fluffy romantic fantasy read, you should be pleasantly suprised. But if you're looking for anything more than that, look elsewhere.	2005-08-02

I expected the same from \\"Undomestic Goddess,\\" and I got what I was looking for.  <br /> <br />In the beginning, reading about a lawyer who's on the verge of having panic attacks almost gave me one. Kinsella can really make you feel what the character is feeling (and thats not the only time). The plot itself is rather unbelievable, but who cares? To me, that made the book even better.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a great fun read, or if you need some new chick lit to read, pick up this book (or any of them, really). Although if you're stressed out about work, you might just want to wait til you cool off.	2005-07-27

Patricia Briggs ends her latest duology spectacularly, with all that you expect to see from her. Mysteries posed in the first book are finally getting some attention, and Seraph also must deal with the dangers her family has been put in.  <br /> <br />As usual, Briggs puts in a lot of wit and charm in this book, mkaing her characters even more endearing. If you were worried that the romance was going to get to sappy in this book, have no fear- although the love is there, its far from nauseating. The story is adeptly paced, keeping you reading from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />If you read \\"Raven's Shadow\\" a while ago, I recommend rereading it before you pick this up, just to save any early confusion (you don't have to, but it'll take a while to remember everything). If you haven't read this series, or even any of Briggs' books, I highly recommend all of her books. She never seems to disappoint.	2005-07-26

I knew it had romantic elements in it after reading a praising review in Romantic Times Magazine.  <br /> <br />This really wasn't sci-fi, which was OK with me. The only thing that made it sci-fi was that they had guns and steam engines. People still ride around on horses, etc. The female dominated society could go either sf or fantasy.  <br /> <br />I felt like I was reading a male romance novel. What guy wouldn't want to be screwed by 30 women? The only difference with this and a normal romance novel was a love of guns and warfare. As a girl though, who am I to say no to a little romance? Ok maybe not a little.  <br /> <br />Just like a romance novel, the reader is supposed to assume its entirely possible for people to fall in love after 5 minutes. Even worse, 10 girls fall in love with the same man after hardly debating the issue. Lets face it- girls (me included) can hardly figure out what shirt to wear in the space of time it took for all these girls to swoon over the male lead.  <br /> <br />Considering I'm not adverse to reading your basic romance novel, I didn't mind all of this. It was enjoyable enough to pass the time with, but not an award-winner by any means. But for those of you looking for an exciting, action-filled sci-fi story, look elsewhere.  <br />	2005-07-07

There's a return of the original cast of characters, even though the story focuses on new ones. \\"Tower of Ravens\\" begins what looks to become a fabulous new series.     If you haven't read her previous series, read that first before you pick up this book. Not only would you be missing out, but you'll also be lost when reading this. Even I had a little bit of trouble since it has been so long since I read \\"Witches.\\" But by keeping the original characters seperate from the main plot, she can continue to forward their story without overdoing it like many authors out today.     Once again Forsyth puts forward an excellent plot and imaginative characters that the reader will completely devour. And it seems she's learned something- gone are the slow spots that occassionally slowed down her original series. This book is absolutely riveting and will keep you craving for more.	2005-06-30

But she Kritzer changed the history so much, it doesn't even feel like Greek history (which is a good thing).  <br /> <br />This has pretty much the same pacing as the first, \\"Freedom's Gate.\\" Lauria is a great character, with good character development (which is really the basis of the story). Tamar is like her anchor, but enough personality to hold her own (which is good, because the next book will change to have both of their viewpoints.  <br /> <br />This book, as well as the previous, deals with the issue of slavery on two levels: people and the djinni. Tamar wants to free slaves to help the world, and Lauria just wants to free those she has wronged. She also has the power to free the djinni, but as of right now will only really do it for selfish reasons (I feel even more development coming on). The one main problem I had with this book is that Kritzer often reexplains things. I felt like saying out loud, \\"I get it.\\" Maybe she underestimated her audience.  <br /> <br />Other than that, this book was very enjoyable. It didn't lose pace like many middle books, and the story moves along quickly.	2005-06-21

For the fans of the first book, this book has everything you loved about Medalon and more.  <br /> <br />Tension has reached a fever pitch in the northern borders of Medalon, and now the reader will see some real action. In the middle of the conflict, a new character is thrown in, Princess Adrina. At first glance she sounds like a snobby princess (well, she really is), but as the story goes on she becomes much more complex. Adrina is one of those ruthless politicians you'll absolutely love.  <br /> <br />R'shiel is growing too, learning to accept her destiny and gaining more of the calmer Harshini attributes as well. And naturally, the gods are still around and meddling so well they give the Greek gods a run for their money.  <br /> <br />The pace is once again well set, one of this series finest attributes. \\"Treason Keep\\" was utterly engaging, and now I can't wait to read \\"Harshini.\\" I'm sure it will be just as good as the last two.	2005-06-14

The pace was set perfectly, with the right amount of action and calm. Although some of her characters are slightly cliche, Fallon gives them a slightly new twist and adds other more unexpected characters into the mix, keeping it refreshing.  <br /> <br />One of my favorite things about this book is its play on religion. You've got the main group in the story, the Meladonians, who are fiercely athiest. Then there are the pagans, whose gods are actually real and behave (I say this fondly) like the Greek gods. The Harshini are basically demi-gods themselves, but naturally everyone thinks they're evil (except the pagans) when they aren't. And finally, there are the monotheists whose god actually exists as well, but he's not the only god. Associate each group with assorted countries, put it together and you've got some fascinating politics.  <br /> <br />This isn't a completely new world by any means, but by putting together many elements of fantasy it all becomes new again. \\"Medalon\\" is well written, in-depth, and incredibly enjoyable. I highly recommend it.	2005-06-13

The publisher let this out? And worse, she's been compared to Tolkien? No. Apparantly it wasn't just me either (man I wish I had checked out the reviews before getting this), except Harriet Klausner, but its not like she's reading any of these books anyway, and her opinion just cements that.     First of all, there are so many ridiculous lists of things that don't matter. I really don't care about all the fifty types of plants that come to the desert after the rains, sorry. And my lord, the decription. If I hear about how Lilith's lips are like petals one more time, I'll vomit. Some description is good, but geez, there's a thing called balance. I've never in my life seen someone go so overboard on description.     There was a glimmer of an interesting story underneath, which is a shame since it drowned underneath the descriptive swamp of this book. But apparantly the author wanted to have a \\"Shakespearean\\" twist to it. Darling, it doesn't work when you write in that style for the narrative, and no one will believe it when you're characters only stick to that style of speaking occasionally with no apparant pattern. Not to mention the fact that her two main characters could be gods for the lack of faults that they have (well, except the one goes nuts, but not for long), and their romance was so incredibly lame I was yearning for a Jennifer Lopez movie for something more realistic.     Please do not even bother. Maybe you can try it in paperback, but be warned, this book is really that bad.	2005-06-13

This book is incredible, on par with some of the best fantasy out there.  <br /> <br />The most intriguing element to me of this story is that it is centered around a city (Elantris). My imagination got some practice building this place in my mind, something it hasn't gotten to do in a long time. From start to finish, Elantris itself plays a key role in the story, a fact that I found, well, really cool.  <br /> <br />The action begins right at the beginning, unexpectedly, and in the first few chapters I got a little confused, thinking I had missed something. But as you keep reading, everything is revealed, so if you pick this book up (which you should), avoid the temptation to keep flicking back and forth to find answers.  <br /> <br />Interesting revelations are spread out through the book and will keep the reader on its edge until the very end. When the end comes its a little too fast-paced, but I can't think of any good way to change it. Not to mention all loose ties are cleaned up, a good thing considering this is a stand-alone. That might be my only real complaint, but so many authors push their books out too far. Even though I'd like to see the characters again, its not necessary and I'd hate to see the story ruined. This book easily in my top five fantasy, and I'm confident most would agree with me after reading it.	2005-06-13

I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Last Dragonlord,\\" so naturally I had to read this one. The same themes lie in the sequel: romance, political intrigue, and magic. Its also longer, and therein lies my main complaint about this book.  <br /> <br />There was a good amount of stuff that could be easily cut out of this book without affecting it.  It just felt like the plot was moving along too slowly. Even though there were other important things going on the same time, there's no need to switch over to another group that isn't doing anything at all. Also, at the end the point of view jumps around quite a bit, but the action is more intense.  <br /> <br />The non-main characters were interesting too. In the first one, they didn't change very much and you usually knew what side they were on. In this book, Bertin works on her characterization by giving more points of view. Even though you know that what a particular character's ideas are wrong, you understand them. I found Shei-Luin, the emperor's concubine, the most interesting. She's somewhat similar Sherrine in the previous book, but she's much more human and rounded out.  <br /> <br />So in some ways this book is better than the last, and in some ways it was worse. In the end, however, I'm glad I read this and I'll be picking up the next one. If you aren't sure whether this series is for you, check out my review for the last book and hopefully that will help. But if you did read and enjoy \\"The Last Dragonlord,\\" give this one a shot. I can't guarantee that you'll love it like I did, it just depends on your tolerance for certain things. I know I liked it, and I hope you do too.	2005-04-25

I still don't think I'd be able to justify spending $27 on the hardcover.  <br /> <br />First thing off the bat- the back cover is misleading. Here I am, thinking she's going to pop the baby out within the first few chapters. Or not. It wouldn't have been so bad to wait til almost the end, but since I was expecting sooner, I was getting furstrated. So take this as a warning.  <br /> <br />I considered this book as kind of a lull between greater things. She's mostly building up plots for the next story and tying up ends from the previous one. Don't think of this as a bad thing, its still a good story. Grunthor is mostly absent in this story, but when you read it you'll learn he's got his own project. Achmed, however, has a big role, mainly arguing with Rhapsody. I found these especially entertaining just because they do it so well.  <br /> <br />There are several other plots going on that I won't explain, but as I said before it seems she is building up to something. I'm not sure if Assassin King is the final in the set, but the way things seem to be heading, it would make sense.  I'm still slightly disappointed that I had to wait so long for this book to come out, and it ended out being short and lacking the grand plots as with the other ones. Yet I was still satisfied with this book, and I'm not so itchy to grab the next one.  <br /> <br />So if you've been following the series, pick this installment (I'd be shocked if you haven't already). If you're checking out all the books on here in order to decide whether to start reading them or not, I highly recommend it. I can see where some people might be disappointed with this book, but overall this series is rewarding, and I'm sure it will all come together in the Assassin King (otherwise I might have to break down Elizabeth Hadyon's door).	2005-04-21

It was lying on my shelf for a few months, and unfortunately it took me a while to pick it up because of some of the nasty reviews on here. I'm glad I did now, though, and I just picked up the sequel.  <br /> <br />I'm thinking that a majority of the negative reviews on here are from men. I can easily understand why they wouldn't like this book. It has a lot of romance, which makes me happy, and little to no violent action, which I don't miss. Some people even complained about the \\"un-hot\\" sex scenes. Pick up Penthouse letters if thats what you're specifically looking for. Although I don't mind some steamy stuff, I don't make it a requirement in my books.  <br /> <br />For those of you looking for a truly epic series, this isn't it. Lets face it people, there's not much of it out there anyway. However, I thought that Bertin did a fabulous job creating her world, especially since I normally don't like all that dragon stuff. I also really enjoyed the characters- they weren't too vapid or annoying, in my opinion (considering this is romance, thats suprising), with enough of a balance in characters.  <br /> <br />Most of the conflict in this book involves politics, with a wee bit of guesswork involved (but not too much, she usually reveals characters quickly enough). I did get a little irritated where she cuts off right before a plot would be fully revealed, which she does a lot, but it wasn't enough to ruin the book for me. I was happy that she didn't have one of those characters that you think is good, but is actually really bad. You'd expect that in this kind of story, but thank god it wasn't there- I'm getting really sick of that. She leaves the characters to deal with that, while the reader generally knows whats going on.  <br /> <br />All in all I found this book a delightful read. If you like romantic fantasy, you're good to go. Unless you're a guy, that is, and expect some wars or fighting or something. Sorry, you probably won't like this book.

The main character, Angarred, seemed flighty, the plot moved along haphazardly, and the other characters seemed bland or one-sided. I don't give up easily though, and my consternation turned to pleasure as the story progressed.     For fans of court intrigue, romantic fantasy, and magic, this book should hold your interest. It's not the best by any means, but it is a good read. I found it slightly refreshing- Glass' writing style is completely different than any other fantasy writers that I have read. For those who liked Canavan's Magician's Guild series, you might want to check this out.     I would consider this book a light read, not nearly as involved as others out there, but good nonetheless. I'll definetly be picking up the next book in the series when it is released in paperback (and for those of you who don't like to start a series before its all published, don't worry, this book ends with a lot of loose ends tied, so you should be able to hold out for the next one in patience). I found \\"Daughter of Exile\\" a worthy read.	2005-03-13

I assumed that this book would be centered on the three characters Veldan, Kaz, and Aethon, but boy was I wrong. The story starts off with them, sure, but then you are introduced to a slew of other characters, and the whole book follows each of their stories and how their paths cross.  <br /> <br />This sounds like a problem, but it really wasn't. I did find myself frustrated occasionally when I wanted to know what happened to another character but had to wait and read a boring story of another. But after the beginning you do get interested in all of them, so the frustration ends quickly. If you read her Aurian books, this is a little different. In those there were also many subplots, but you could easily distinguish the main characters. This book is like one huge subplot though, and even though Veldan and Kaz are on the cover, I still don't get the feeling they are the main characters. I'm hoping that'll change in the next book.  <br /> <br />This book moves very slowly time-wise. Everything occurs in about three days, and sometimes its difficult to line up what each character is doing in order. I'm sure thats on purpose though, and it definetly keeps you on your toes.  <br /> <br />The characters are very likeable in my opinion, especially Kazail the firedrake. I've noticed Furey is very good at characterization, not making a person completely bad or good, and gives them the ability to change. One thing I preferred about this book over her last series is less wimpy characters. For those of you who read the Artefacts series, you should know what I'm talking about (I can't stand whiners). I'm crossing my fingers that it'll stay that way.  <br /> <br />And for all you romance lovers, there isn't any in this book, although some future possibilities seem to be forming. Overall, I really did enjoy this book, even though it had a few flaws. I'm even more glad that I have the next two handy. If you did read her last series(and liked it), I would recommend you pick up all three. Otherwise, try the first one and see how you like it. I think all fantasy readers should give it a shot though.	2005-03-13

There were some flaws though that irritated me throughout the way, and I was very disappointed in Shinn's writing style (her Archangel series seems to be very popular, and although I haven't read it, from the way I've seen her work described I expected better).  <br /> <br />First off, it was very predictable. Not in the just-like-every-other-fantasy sense, although it wasn't anything terribly new, but I often found myself rolling my eyes since it would be obvious what happened next. I got the sense of just being strung along on a series of mediocre adventures with all obvious outcomes.  <br /> <br />It took me about halfway through the book to actually bond with some of the characters, and it was not even close to the bonds I've felt with characters from other books (maybe its a problem, but I can really grow attached to a character if they're written right). I'm sure your meant to, since there are situations meant for just a thing, but it just doesn't work. For example, Tayse (the hero) stops talking to Senneth (the heroine) for ridiculous reasons. I understood why, in a sense, but I felt like I was missing a whole lot to make me actually relate to him. I get the feeling that Shinn was grasping at straws to create conflict between her main characters.  <br /> <br />Despite all that, I was relatively happy closing this book. The loose ends were tied up fairly well considering this is the first book in the series, and I'll be able to wait patiently for the next book to come out. But maybe that isn't such a good thing, since some of the best books I've read keep me aching for the next chapter. I recommend this book as a light read, and if you go into it with few expectations I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It is definetly not a bad book, but it simply lacks what I want out of epic romantic fantasy. But who knows? This is just the beginning.	2005-03-08
US	23512652	R1KLXD6BEB8P29	0553565257	522494607	Aurian (First Book)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Fabulous!	I just started getting into fantasy a little over a year ago, and after voraciously reading everything that caught my interest, I had nothing else to read. My friend gave me this series, and after a few months I decided to pick it up. I finished Aurian, the first book in the Artefacts of Power series, within a day. The fast-paced actions kept me hanging on my seat, and although sometimes it was too much, it kept me completely enveloped in the story.  <br /> <br />I prefer not to give synopses in my reviews, since they are already available to you. But quickly, Aurian's world is one either ruled by chaos or peace. In this book, chaos is obviously prevailing, and Aurian is the one who will decide the balance. Although the balance will not be restored by the end of this book, she is partly to her goal.  <br /> <br />I only had a few problems with this book. Sometimes the action comes so quickly it is easy to get lost, but if you pace yourself it won't become too much of a problem. A map would have been nice, as well as a glossary, and naturally I didn't think to check the next book, which has both. So if you haven't read either yet, pick up both and maybe they will be helpful to you.  <br /> <br />Other than that, this book is filled with romance, drama, and action; all the things I look for in a fantasy book. To some of you that may be cliche, but Furey manages too keep the good parts of the cliches while dumping out the annoying parts (at least in my preference). I'd compare this book to another one, but none really comes to mind. But if you are a fan of epic romantic fantasy, pick this up. I'm just starting the second one, so I can't say if the series stays consistently good, but I know that reading the first book was definetly worth it, and I can't imagine that her series will go downhill drastically (you learn to pick this kind of stuff out). I highly recommend this book to all fantasy lovers.	2005-02-19
US	23512652	RB6V3DCLE5H4N	0756401690	313475018	Mage Of Clouds #2: (The Cloud Mages #2)	Books	3	7	8	N	N	Got old fast	The major problem that I had with this book is that Jenna's daughter Meriel, whose point of view makes up a majority of the book, parallels way too close to her mother. She rejects her future, runs around getting into misadventures, falls in love with a guy she isn't attracted to in the beginning, gets into battle, and then her title gets elevated. Sure, there are enough differences for the author to get away with this I guess, but the predictability just ruined it for me.     On the plus side, the action did keep me reading. Maybe there was a little part of me that thought I wouldn't be able to figure out what happened, but halfway through the book I realized that wasn't going to happen, and at that point I had to finish reading anyway. I got even more frustrated when Farrel turned Jenna into a flat character, putting all his effort into Jenna (which was pointless, considering they're very much alike). I just spent 500 pages in the previous book getting to know Jenna, and now she's just, well, blegh. Very disappointed.     The last few chapters are quick-moving considering the amount of action. However, I wouldn't say they were engrossing; they kept my interest up enough to turn the page. All in all I was pretty disappointed in this second book. Holder of Lightning wasn't superb, but I had wanted to continue reading the series. Unfortunately, it was just way too similar to the previous one for me to give a good rating, and I felt there was a lot of room for improvement.	2005-02-16

Its nothing to be ashamed of, the place is enormous. So I needed a good map of the place without blatantly looking like a tourist. I had tried a few others, and this one was definetly the best.  <br /> <br />There are two maps: one of all the streets and then a subway map. The map of the subways is easier than the ones provided at the subways, which is nice because since I refuse to step into a taxi. Then there's a basic map, with important places written directly on it.  <br /> <br />The second half of this has recommendations and locations on places to check out. Museums, food, shopping, etc. The food isn't really that helpful simply because there is soooo much to gorge on in NYC, and I recommend the Time Out NY Eating and drinking guide for that. Other than that, its nice to have all the big locations in one booklet.  <br /> <br />It also comes with a compass, which is fabulous (if you've ever been deposited off Canal st. and can't figure out which direction to go in, you'll understand). It has a pen too and a spot for notes, but I can't really comment on that since I bought mine sans pen. I'm sure its great though. Best thing of all, it'll fit in your clutch. None of those horrible maps you've got to unroll and unfold and turn this way and that, this one's a pop-up. Just be careful with it though, if you close it wrong it'll take you a half an hour to close it right again.  <br /> <br />I definetly recommend this to anyone who is new or semi-new to the city, and you want to check out all the great things the most fabulous city in the world has to offer.	2005-02-13

But his father's work in Avonar has kept him away from his son, so Karon decides to take Gerick over the Bridge and risk the eyes of the Lords of Zhev'Na so he can bond with his son for a night. Yet right after they return, the problems start coming.     Gerick is accused of being a traitor, people all over Leire are disappearing, and the mysterious people responsible are haunting Gerick's dreams. There is another world, the Bounded, and its people are convinced Gerick will rule them.    As with the last book, the point of view changes between characters, although a bulk of it will go to Gerick. He has stopped his incessant whining and temper tantrums and is acting more like an adult. Karon is losing himself to the more violent D'Natheil, the Prince's personality overwhelming Karon's in his rage. Seri must decide whether she believes her husband or her son, and must play mediator between the two. The character's changes as well as the fast-paced plot make this book come to life.     I absolutely loved this book. It outshone the previous two, and thats saying something. Berg plays with the reader's emotions and uses them to make an intense story that you can't put down. Definetly one of the best fantasy series I've ever read, and this book concludes it impeccably. I highly recommend it.    quick edit* Apparantly this is not the last book of the series. Apparantly Carol Berg decided to put one more book in so she could work with Gerick's issues. Sounds exciting, details are on her site. Its called \\"Daughter of Ancients\\" and should be out sometime in September.	2005-02-07

Finally we have an ending to the Black Jewels Trilogy (sorry if that killed it for those who haven't read it yet, but at least you won't have to wait as long as those who read it did to get a real ending). And what an ending it is! I loved it!    Ok, so this book is actually comprised of four stories. The first, in all honestly, I completely didn't understand. One of the things I disliked about the BJ Trilogy was that I totally didn't understand the whole threads and webs thing. But hey, thats just me, maybe you got it and you'll like this story. For those who didn't, well luckily its short and you don't need to understand it.     The next story is about how Lucivar met his wife. Ahhhhh what a beautiful story. Some parts are sad, some super happy, some anger, etc. I promise its not cheesy though (well, maybe not too much). There were some parts that made me laugh my butt off too, much more than most of Bishop's work (good stuff, I promise). You get to see more sides of Jaenelle as well; more of her human-like qualities are shown, but she's still a pretty fierce chick. After this story, Lucivar really grew on me, much more than in the trilogy.     The third story is basically what happens when you piss Saetan off. It goes back in time, previous to the whole trilogy (if this sounds like it'll throw you off, I promise it won't). You learn more about Saetan's character here, and it explains a few things you might have not understood before.     Last, but not least, is the addition to the ending of the BJ trilogy (I guess its technically not the ending, but feels more like an ending than the last one). Those questions you had when you finished the trilogy will all be answered, thank god. Definetly much more satisfying, as well as a great story in itself.     One thing I must point out- the cover art is so much better on this book. Its so lame, I know, but I really hated those covers. I'll even lookpast the fact that Jaenelle is blond, not a brunette, but oh well.     If you haven't read the Black Jewels Trilogy, you will not understand this book. It is specifically meant to add on to the original trilogy, so if you try to read it you will be sufficiently lost. But if you have read the trilogy, PICK THIS UP! Even if its been a while since you read them, do it. You can go ahead and re-read them, but its really not necessary. It had been a while since I read them, and I managed just fine. I found this book 50 times more engrossing than the trilogy, and I loved the triogy too. The stories flow better, the characters are more in depth, and finally you can rest easy in regards to what happens to everyone.	2005-02-04

I picked this up, however, with a lack of anything better to read. I'm definetly glad I did.  <br /> <br />For those of you who read the Rai-Kirah series, Berg has improved on the few things I considered negative in that series. Often, she presented information much too quickly, and it became confusing and unclear. Here, she explains things much better without sacrificing the fast-past setting in which things are revealed.  <br /> <br />As with her previous series, the characters are multi-faceted and easy to love (or some grow on you). There are mysteries to be solved in this trilogy, some the reader can guess and some they can't. I love this mixture- I feel like I'm super-smart because I figured it out, but I'm not smart enough to figure it all out (good thing too, otherwise this book would suck).  <br /> <br />And for the romantic fantasy readers- have no fear. Carol shows her more feminine side with this book, using a female as her main character (in her previous trilogy, it was a man). Seri has gone through some rough times in her life, making her strong, but she still has her weaknesses. I love this character- her problems and pain take us through the plot, bringing it alive.  <br /> <br />I definetly recommend this series, particularly because I know the next book in the series is just as good (and so far what I've read of the third as well). Carol Berg knows how to write a great story that will keep you asking for more.	2005-02-04

Sonea has really grown up in this book, acting more like an adult than a child. Out of all of the three books, this one has the most action. I got the feeling of an emotional rolercoaster when reading this book, but in a good way. I was totally involved, devouring one page after another.  <br /> <br />Sonea has to face her greatest fears, and she soon learns things aren't exactly what they seem. One thing this book has that the others don't- good old fahioned romance (always a favorite of mine). Now Sonea must face the problem outside of the Guild, and all the pain, death, and suffering that goes along with it. All of the other main characters have their own troubles to go through as well, from their own point of view. Everything culminates at the very end, and although all the issues are addressed and nothing is left hanging, I found myself yearning for more. So if I had a problem with this book, it is that I grew way too attached to the characters (plus a fair bit of crying at the end- damn you Trudi!).  <br /> <br />So if you're thinking about reading this series and want to make sure the quailty is sustained throughout the series, I assure you it is. I'd recommend this book to those who have already read the first two, but I'm sure most of you don't need the recommendation. Definetly a fabulous and engrossing read. Pick it up!	2005-02-04

I'm normally not a super-fan of celtic fantasy, but I enjoyed Kate Forsyth's series so I figured I'd be ok.  <br /> <br />The beginning starts out kind of slow, although you don't get to learn too much about Jenna before the action begins, which creates a problem (her personality changes quickly from an addiction, and even though its pointed out, you don't relate since you aren't even sure what Jenna's original personality was). I also had a problem with some of the characters- some are supposed to be those changing characters- you think they're something they're really not. This is common in fantasy, but Farrell is missing something. I think its the fact there are no hidden things that you realize after you learn the character's true self. Maybe not though.  <br /> <br />But honestly, if you're looking for some fantasy to read (I never thought it would happen, but I'm running out of books to read), this is a pretty good book. After the beginning, the plot moves fairly quickly, it's not confusing, there's romance as well as political intrigue, and there's a lot going on in the plot. The characters aren't top-notch and can be irritating at times, but it's still enjoyable. Definetly give it a shot and see what you think.	2005-02-04

After a devoured the first book, I picked this up right away, and to my dismay, it was written from different points of view. I was disheartened: most authors who do this screw it up royally. But I needed to know what happened, or I might have died on the spot, I swear.  <br /> <br />Luckily, Berg managed to pull it off. It was nice to understand the thoughts of the other characters along with Seri, and it definetly added a new dimension to the story. Occasionally I wanted to beat Gerick though, especially since I had to deal with his actions twice (once from his point of view, as well as another character's viewing it from their situation). But what else can you expect from a teenager? I'm sure my parents wanted to beat me too sometimes (joke, joke).  <br /> <br />Seri's relationship with Karon is put on hold- completely frustrating. I want to see my characters together and happy, but then I guess it wouldn't be as exciting. It lasts pretty much the whole book though, so I wasn't a happy camper. I'm sure others are much more tolerant about these things than I am, and it was still very enjoyable nonetheless (plus things are better in the third book, so no fretting).  <br /> <br />There are some dramatic plot twists just like in the last one, some you can guess and some you can't. There is action on a larger scale than the last one, and you're introduced to the Lords of Zhev'Na and their home. The book moves on a good pace most of the time, with very few lulls. I couldn't put it down. I definetly recommend this series to all fantasy readers.	2005-02-04

This is a must-have for anyone remotely interested in Ancient Greece, although this book is enjoyable even if you aren't.<br /><br />Hamilton hits on all the basics of Greek mythology, including theogony, heroic epics, and (my favorite) the love stories. Most books concerning Greek mythology only deal with certain things, or have less-than desirable synopses. Not to mention it's compiled in a small, cheap paperback (history books aren't cheap anymore, they're almost all published in hardcover and trade paperback).<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this book- if I'm bored, i can just flip to one of my favorite stories. ALthough the book is in a type of chronological order, most of the stories can be read without reading the previous ones (although I highly recommend it, since they're all really good stories).<br /><br />So if you've ever been interested in the historical version of The Trojan War (you aren't going to get it from the movies), if Pygmalion really fell in love with a statue, or all about Zeus' philandering and his wife's clever trickery to catch him in the act, buy this book :)	2004-12-16

Who knew that staples caused so many office accidents? Oh and did you know that holy water is actually bad for you?  <br /> <br />Of course, there are the staple things that everyone knows is harmful to your health- drugs, smoking, drinking. But even with those the author adds at least something you didn't know, plus his little quips make all that drug education pounded into your head in middle school actually funny.   <br /> <br />The book is in dictionary format- best idea ever. Get this book, then have all your friends shout out something and you look it up. I'm sure it could make an interesting drinking game too, I haven't tried though.  <br /> <br />If you're a parent and would like to annoy the hell out of your child, if you're a hypochondriac and you need something to blame, or maybe if you're just bored, this is a great book. But if you are paranoid, I wouldn't recommend it. This will definetly not make you feel good.	2004-12-16

For fans of the magazine, this is a compliation of the most popular stories out of the magazine, compiled with author's notes and great artwork.  <br /> <br />Although it doesn't have as much information as an issue of the magazine, the book has a wider span of topics, complete with articles and photos, as well as stories that weren't featured in the magazine.  <br /> <br />The price is great too, cheaper than most normal hardcovers. Plus there's an index, so if you're looking for something specific, it can be easily found (try doing that with the magazines).  <br /> <br />For those of you who haven't read the magazine, this book is all about what makes New Jersey weird: UFO's, ghosts, scary places, strange people, etc. The book mainly consists of reader's own experiences (also the basis for the magazine).

Then pick this book up. Usually I'm skeptical on reading books that \\"solve\\" history problems, but the book was on sale, and I needed something to read. Now I can't stop reading it. Far from being written like a textbook (god knows I have enough of those to deal with), this is much more light. It's in the format of a story, with you and the author as the detective. He poses the questions to you, as the reader, to come up with your own conclusions.  <br /> <br />I'm still not finished reading it, but I don't anticipate this book losing what I like best about it- the historical accuracy. In books like these, most authors will only show there view. Occasionally, for good measure, they'll stick in a comment from the opposing side (and usually in the process will belittle that person). Thats not the case here. The author actually made sure every step of the way his information was actually correct, and established that with assorted individuals with great credentials. Not only that, but he poses all plausible scenarios, with pros and cons for each. I might also add he's getting things right. I just took a few classes that can coincide with it, from some very conservative professors (not a bad thing for historians. I'm almost positive that if I handed them this book, they'd agree. Try doing that with a Graham Hancock book- you won't get far.  <br /> <br />This book doesn't rewrite history, it simply provides an argument on some of the greatest mysteries surrounding the Exodus. Where was Mount Sinai? What routes did the Israelites take? He uses different types of sciences (archaeology, geology, etc) to answer these questions, as well as linguistics and generally history.  <br /> <br />If you're concerned about the religious context, it can be taken either way. I'm not religious, but I love biblical archaeology.  For those of you who are, fear not- the author states in the beginning of the book that far from disproving anything, he proves that the events of the Exodus were even more miraculous.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to any history buff, whether professional or not. Even if you only have a slight interest in the topic matter, I'm sure this book will keep you reading.	2004-12-10

I picked it up, however, since it sounded intriguing. After a few months of sitting on my shelf, I finally began to read it, and had it finished within the next day.     What a nice break in the cliche fantasy out there. Of course there was romance (I wouldn't read it if it wasn't), but it had a different feel than other stories. The main character get married, even though they aren't really in love, and grow on each other. Usually in a situation like this, the two will spite each other, then fall in love. That's not the case here; they have an understanding with each other, almost a friendship. It makes the scenario almost plausible.    The characters have wonderful and believable personalities, once again making them more understandable. I love a fantasy book that relates to my emotions on a normal level, simply because they're so hard to find. The plot is exciting, with lulls in just the right places, and an ending that granted, makes me ask for more, but I could put it down and be happy with no sequel (I can't stand ambiguous endings). I really grew on the characters, so I was hoping that she'd continue with them, but that doesn't seem to be her style.     All in all, a great read for a fantasy lover, especially if you aren't ready to pick up a new series yet.     EDIT* Just found out there will be a sequel to this! I wasn't expecting this, so maybe thats why I'm so excited. It's called Raven's Strike, and it comes out July 26th, 2005 straight into paperback. Thought I'd let you know ;)	2004-12-10

Amazingly, I didn't feel like I was reading Penthouse Letters. Carey words these scenes in a very poetic way, but, well, they're still explicit.  <br /> <br />That aside, this isn't your usual fantasy novel. There's no dragons, or anything really magical (well, at least in the first book). It is filled with, however, political intrigue, romance, and even a smattering of biblical and European history.  <br /> <br />We follow Phedre from being really nothing to working her way up the societal latter. She's got the mark of Kushiel, which basically means she likes pain. Really likes it. As a courtesan, this makes her particularly special, and people pay a lot of money for someone who likes to be beaten. Thats the blunt way of describing it, but Carey makes this interesting trait sound much more romantic.  <br /> <br />I don't need to give you a synopsis, since those are already available to you, but I can give you my opinion. This trilogy is amazing. You will fall in love with the characters (in fact, a friend of mine would just love to name her first-born after Phedre's love interest, because he's simply that amazing), and the plot is filled with adventure. <br /> <br />I used to only recommend this book to girls, simply because of its explicit nature, but suprise, a lot of men enjoy this too. You don't have to be a fantasy fan to read this, honestly. Just try it- you won't be disappointed.	2004-12-10

After searching and searching for a good book on this subject, I happened upon this one. All the others taught you the occasional word, but mostly involved Egyptian history and traditions. This book was really about teaching you hieroglyphics.  <br /> <br />It first must be stated that Egyptian is tough. There are no vowels. One hieroglyph can mean a zillion things. A ton of hieroglyphs can mean the same exact thing. Its tough. If you are bad at learning languages, walk away now.  <br /> <br />That being said, if you're still interested in learning this language, this is the book to get. Its written in a workbook format, complete with exercises and a dictionary. I can't tell you exactly how accurate it is, although I'm sure it is, but I'll update when I actually take a class on this. In the meantime, this book is very thorough, starting with the basics and working its way to more involved deciphering.  <br /> <br />This is a must for any blossoming Egyptologist, especially since its tough to find a class on this (heck, its hard enough finding a school for archaeology). Its not bad for bragging rights either, so if you feel like learning a dead language to show it off, you might enjoy this as well.	2004-12-10

Any writer who makes me almost pee my pants every ten minutes always holds a special place in my heart. So when I saw he was coming out with a new book, I was totally excited.  <br /> <br />Although he doesn't disappoint when describing his extremely weird idiosyncracies, I found it wasn't as rolling on the floor funny as his previous books. There are moments though. My particular favorite is when he tries to stick his sister in the middle of the road to exact revenge on his mother. You just can't find stuff like this normally! <br /> <br />If you have read Sedaris before, definetely buy this (at least to support his smoking habit). If you haven't, then try picking up one of his other books first. Sedaris is borderline insane, and his bluntness is refreshing to say the least. And you thought your family was nuts...	2004-12-10

But hey, you should too. It's even more historically accurate than the Da Vinci Code (well, thats not saying much).  <br /> <br />I'm not going to give you a synopsis, you can just read the back of the book. I enjoyed the first book in this series enough to pick up this copy, and I'm glad I did. For those of you who were highly irritated with the character's maturity levels in Hades' Daughter, you can breathe freely now. Cornelia (Caela) and Brutus (William) have actually grown up in the past 1,000 years. But don't worry, Genvissa (Swanne) is still completely evil and rotten.  <br /> <br />There are, of course, those little idiosyncracies in the writing that are always a part of Sara Douglass' books. I swear, someone is always pregnant. But they don't overwhelm the book (like they did in the Axis trilogy), and her loyalty to being historically accurate is wonderful.  Granted, I'm sure there are some things wrong, but I can't pick them out. So if you know anything about the Norman Conquest in 1066, it will make the book that much more satisfying, I promise.	2004-12-09
US	23512652	RPOKYVJLANHHS	0395939461	619220705	The Silmarillion	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Beautiful Book!	I own this particular edition, which I purchased for its amazing illustrations. If you're a Tolkien fan at all, the paperbacks just shouldn't cut it. There are a multitude of amazing editions of the Trilogy and its companion books. I found Ted Nasmuth's illustrations to be simply amazing, and it was worth every penny I paid for it.  <br /> <br />For those who have not read the Silmarillion, let me say right off the bat- this can be a difficult read.  The best comparison I can come up with is the Bible. This book is about history, and it is written as a historical text. I highly recommend trying it though. If you have some trouble, David Day published an encyclopedia on Tolkien, and that can be a great help. Once you understand the characters and the histories, the tales Tolkien puts forth in this book are simply amazing. It's like the trilogy, multiplied by a hundred. All the action, the romance, the amazing places completely fill this book. My favorite story is the Tale of Luthien and Beren (naturally, I'm a total sap when it comes to romance). That story alone is worth the price of the book.  <br /> <br />If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy, pick this up! I'm sure you won't be disappointed.	2004-12-05
US	23512652	R1UYUEN6VZZZ50	0812570812	953091978	Rhapsody : Child of Blood	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Amazing!	At first I was drawn away from this book, simply because the back of the book made it sound completely cheesy. Finally, after some harrassment from my boss and a lack of nothing good to read, I finally picked it up.<br />Immediately I got suckered in. Rhapsody is my perfect heroine; she'll kick some butt, but doesn't forget her feminine side (although her total obliviousness of her beauty gets annoying). Achmed was completely different than any other character I had ever read (in a good way) and Grunthor is just great. I never got bogged down in the plot (although there were a few slow spots), I didn't get lost, which can happen with fantasy, and the only thing I can compain about is that I read them way too fast and now I'm stuck waiting for the fifth book.<br />This is a definite must-read for any fantasy lover!	2004-06-01

Trudi Canvan's storyline and writing style create an enthralling read. I couldn't put it down. The characters are well-formulated, and the world she creates is so easy to fall into and make it real.	2004-01-28
