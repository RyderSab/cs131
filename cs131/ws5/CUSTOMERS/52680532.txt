When I first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly.  Soon, though, I realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across.<br /><br />The story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins Tassie and Ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the Nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (Nollop, inventor of the sentence \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\\"--of note because it contains every letter of the English alphabet).<br /><br />The idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the English language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects.  First, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies.<br /><br />I found Ella Minnow Pea a very quick and enjoyable read.  It is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about.  If you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it.  It is rare that I come across a book that has a word in it with which I am not familiar; this book contained MANY words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, I think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters).<br /><br />I recommend this book--especially for those who, like I, are concerned about the direction OUR society is taking in terms of censorship.	2005-06-13

Loads of people in my book chat had told me that I needed to read this book--that it was LOL funny.  When I finally started it, I was having trouble getting into it...it just didn't grab me right away.  However, once I got into it, there was no letting go--it of me or me of it!<br /><br />For those like myself who were raised on parables from the Bible and Sunday School, you will have a familiarity with these characters that feels comfortable and homey.  If, also like me, you haven't really done a lot of study of the Bible outside of your childhood learning, you may learn a lot, too, and find yourself questioning some of your Biblical teachings and/or wanting to read more of/about the Bible yourself.<br /><br />Yes, it's an unusual & humorous fictional imagining of the story of Jesus' boyhood that will be thought sacriligeous by some, but I found it a very interesting and thought-provoking story.  Within days of my finishing it, I had a long conversation with a close friend of mine, who is one of the most spirital and religiously well-read people I know.  When I told him about the book and how the author had imagined Jesus spending his learning years, my friend said it sounded like the author had based its events on a lot of factual information.<br /><br />It's a very entertaining and funny book.  But, more importantly, it is a wonderful story of deep friendship and caring for humankind, of learning and teaching and of the ultimate sacrifice.  I am sad the story is over, but it will always be in my heart.	2005-05-23

Deaver has been my favorite mystery/thriller novel writer for several years so, when I saw this short story collection by him, I figured I had to give it a shot.  Glad I did!  He doesn't call this collection \\"Twisted\\" by accident.  Each story features a devious, crazy or grin-inducing twist and the book is a quick read.<br /><br />If I have any criticism of this book it is that, after a while, I started (often unconsciously) applying mental energy to trying to figure out what twist was coming in each new story instead of paying full attention to the story.  It bugged me, but not THAT much.  The stories are not all the same level of quality but most are very enjoyable.  I recall only one that I didn't think should have been in the book.  Being a special fan of Deaver's Rhyme character, I especially liked the story featuring Rhyme & Sachs.<br /><br />This would be a great beach read...quick and in short spurts and not as grisly or scary as his novels.	2005-05-20

I read Thin for Life, the book that this journal is based on, in the fall of 2003 when I was still new to healthy eating.  It remains the most powerful and helpful book I have ever read on weight loss and weight maintenance.  I bought myself the Thin for Life Daybook for Christmas 2003 so that I could start journalling January 1, 2004.  I used the Daybook the entire year and asked for another one for Christmas 2004 so that I could continue in 2005, which I've done.<br /><br />I love that the Daybook provides not only a place to journal your food, but that it has a weekly exercise planner where I plan out what my exercise will be each week.  Making this commitment to writing down my exercise plan each week has been instrumental in keeping me regular with exercise (I worked out 6 days a week for most of 2004 but have scaled back to 5 days a week since late 2004).  When my workout alarm goes off at 5-5:30 a.m., and I feel like turning it off and going back to sleep, I picture the exercise planner page in my Daybook and having to write a DASH next to it (my symbol for when I did not do my planned exercise), it motivates me to give more of an effort.  Does it ALWAYS get me out of bed when I don't feel like exercising?  Nope.  But it does help a lot!  I also love that the journal provides a place to log your goals for the week and to anticipate what obstacles you might face (Christmas party, etc.) and plan ahead on how to get through them.  The tips and mini worksheets at the beginning of each week are helpful to help you address areas where you may need to improve.<br /><br />What I don't love about the Daybook is that the space for what I call \\"feelings journalling\\" (i.e., jotting down how you felt this week, what your challenges were, what your victories were, etc.) is really inadequate.  I would LOVE to see more space.<br /><br />All in all, it is a GREAT journal and I highly recommend it.	2005-04-21
US	52680532	RV3AWGRVIBCZY	0765345889	310489756	I Love You Like a Tomato	Books	4	14	15	N	Y	One of the most endearing--& odd--main characters I've read!	I had just finished reading a VERY heavy novel and this one was recommended to me as being very funny so I thought it would be a perfect choice to cheer me up.  I mistook \\"funny\\" to mean that it was a light story--it's not.  It is a story full of sadness and misfortune.  However, it is made more palatable by a main character (a little girl named ChiChi) who is such a life force and a spitfire that she frames most things in a wry, if not outright funny, way.  She is a real corker!<br /><br />The writing of this book was very enjoyable...you can hear ChiChi's impertinent language and see her wacky behavior.  ChiChi believes to her core that SHE ALONE has responsibility for keeping horrible things from happening to her loved ones by praying, by use of The Evil Eye (taught to her by her beloved grandmother) on those who would threaten her family, and by a dizzying array of bizarre rituals she performs during troubled times (hopping on one foot, walking on the outsides of her feet, etc.).  Her absolute devotion to her family, but especially her sickly baby brother, Marco, is breath-taking (even though her devotion is so often shown in bizarre and sometimes self-destructive ways).<br /><br />The writing of the novel and the character of ChiChi were so superior that I was able to continue reading through the constant onslaught of misfortunes experienced by the family (even though I was thinking \\"SHEESH!  Enough already!\\").  I understand that the \\"bad stuff\\" is necessary to show the strength and will of the characters to survive...and how overcoming so much misfortune makes you bond with the characters even more...but I still say this could have been achieved with a little LESS \\"bad stuff.\\"<br /><br />Granted, going right from a really heavy book to this one didn't help matters.  Maybe if I'd have come from a lighter book to this one, it would have hit me differently.  For the record, though, this isn't a weepy book (at least not for me) so that was at least one break I got from the last one! :)I got from the last one! :)	2005-04-10
US	52680532	R33MIA9BMW5Q9U	0618485228	25220636	The Namesake: A Novel	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Did I read a different book?	Perhaps I had my expectations built up so high before I ever bought this book.  Several folks in my book chat room told me it was their favorite read of 2004.  These are people who read vast quantities of books every year--many more than I--so I figured this book must really be something.  Well, frankly, I was underwhelmed.  That's not to say it's a BAD book...not at all.  I just didn't find it that impressive.<br /><br />In January 2004, I started keeping a book journal.  In the journal, I not only write how I felt about a book (and give it a grade based on how well I liked it) but I also note some of my favorite passages.  To do this, I mark favorite passages with small tape tags as I read.  The last book I finished (Four Spirits by Sena Jeter Naslund) had probably close to two dozen tape tags when I finished.  Other books I enjoyed in 2004 like the Time Traveler's Wife, The Secret Life of Bees and Middlesex all had at least a handful of tape tags.  The Namesake had none.<br /><br />Perhaps it just wasn't the book for me.  Perhaps the story just didn't capture me.  Perhaps the writing wasn't the kind that catches my attention.  I can't really say WHY it didn't impress me.  At least, by the end of the book, I was much more impressed than I was in the first 20 pages (after reading the first 20 pages, I said \\"This CAN'T be the book people told me about--I must have bought the wrong book!\\").  I kind of miss Gogol and the family now that I'm done...so clearly, it DID have an impact on me.  Just not the one I was expecting.	2005-02-16

On the whole, I found this book helpful because it pointed out things to me that I hadn't seen framed that way before.  Ms. Kuffel's writing style really bugged me in the first third of the book...it seemed like she was working overtime to impress us with her vocabulary...but once I got pulled into her story, this element of her writing no longer jumped out at me.<br /><br />As much as I appreciated how difficult it had to be to be so honest and forthright about telling her story, the book had a rather schizophrenic and inconsistent property to it.  Some things are explored in tremendous detail and some are glossed over entirely.  There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but I am still appreciative of the issues that she DID explore.<br /><br />While I could not relate to the aspects of the book that dealt with Frances' binge eating issues, I could definitely relate to having a weight problem much of one's life and the way people discount you when you're fat.  Her concept of how people pigeon-hole you as \\"the fat one\\" and then don't know how to relate when you're no longer fat was really an eye-opener.<br /><br />I'm glad I read the book, but I wish it had been more consistent and left less things unsaid.	2005-01-15
US	52680532	R1VNM5XIP75KQJ	006093669X	815132259	Four Spirits	Books	4	21	21	N	N	Not like any reading experience I have ever had.	I just finished \\"Four Spirits\\" this weekend--after TWO MONTHS of reading.  In part, it took me this long because it is over 500 pages; in part, because I kept it at work and only read on my lunch break; and, in part, because the emotional weight of this story is so intense that it just isn't material that you breeze through...you have to absorb its impact if you are to reap the full benefits of the experience.<br /><br />Naslund brilliantly weaves real events (such as the bombing of a Birmingham church in which four little girls perished) and real people (Martin Luther King, Jr. and others in the civil rights movement) into a rich tapestry of fictional characters and events.  Through these fictional characters, we see and feel the impact of the horrific events of this shameful period in our history.<br /><br />In the beginning, I had a hard time with the format--each short chapter was about a different character, so it might be many chapters before the storyline you were most interested in would resume.  I understood that it was necessary to introduce the characters fully and deeply enough that I would care about them when the tragic events of this story start unfolding.  In that, Ms. Naslund was very successful.<br /><br />It must be said that this book is very difficult to read--not journalistically or linguistically, but emotionally.  That is not to say it is a story that should not be told or read.  I am deeply grateful that I have experienced it and yet, there were times when I said \\"I can't take any more\\" because the intensity of emotion and piling-on effect of tragic events was just too much (the irony that the people in Birmingham--and all across the South--in the 1960s may have been feeling the same way is not lost on me).<br /><br />I have read many sad books.  I have read many books that have made me weep, that have made my heart ache.  But this...this goes beyond that.  Reading \\"Four Spirits\\" is like going into battle...it is not a passive experience.  I am better for having read it, but it was not without a price.ence.

Rating this book was VERY difficult (for reasons which will be explained below).  I really did not feel it rated a 4 on its own merit but, because I have been such a huge fan of the series, I gave it a higher score.<br /><br />I have been a fan of the Stephanie Plum series from book #1 and have read 9 of the 10 (in order) and enjoyed them all to varying degrees.  But I must say that I think this series is starting to falter.  That's not to say it's not still funny.  In \\"To the Nines\\" in particular, Lula's \\"all meat\\" diet and especially the scene in Vegas at the Tom Jones show had me ROLLING.  However, a few funny scenes does not a story make.<br /><br />I'm getting really tired of Stephanie being the victim, screwing up over and OVER again (doesn't she learn ANYTHING from her mistakes?) and constantly needing a white knight (namely Morelli, Ranger or one of the Merry Men) to ride in and rescue her.  What kind of image is this for women???<br /><br />Maybe it's just me and I'm getting tired of the series, but I am just not finding the same level of \\"I HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK NOW!\\" excitement with #9 that I had earlier in the series.	2004-09-15
US	52680532	RQ2Q9IA1JAIET	015602943X	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	5	8	9	N	Y	Compelling, touching and heart-capturing!	This very unusual story introduces us to Clare, a young girl who meets an older man, Henry, many times during her childhood as he \\"appears\\" out of thin air in the meadow behind her house.  Henry has chrono-displacement, which causes him to spontaneously time travel, usually into the past.  Clare grows up adoring Henry, yet a little intimidated by his knowledge of her future and a little uneasy about how Henry's constant presence in her life is going to change her.<br /><br />Without a doubt, Henry's inability to control his time travelling (and the manner in which it happens) has shaped HIS life.  It has made him a very different person than he likely would have been without this \\"problem.\\"  Because only his physical body time travels (and not his clothing), he always ends up naked wherever--or should I say WHENever--he ends up.  As a result, he's had to become adept at thievery (one can't just walk around naked, can one?).  Further, he is comfortable with lying because, well, what are you going to tell people?  The truth...that you're a TIME TRAVELER?!?<br /><br />You can go into this book with pessimism (time travel, HA!) or you can release judgment and go into this book with your heart and mind open to wherever (and whenever) it takes you.  I absolutely FELL IN LOVE with this book.  It's a long book and, being that I don't spend great chunks of time reading, it usually takes me a good while to finish one.  That actually made this book better...because it gave me some time to process what I was reading--which was, at times, confusing.<br /><br />This is not a science fiction book, though it is about time travel.  This is not a romance book, though it includes a beautiful love story.  To categorize this rich and unique story as just one thing is to rob it of its spirit.  It is heart-breaking and joyful and thought-provoking and it impacted me in deep and wonderful ways.  How something that has so much sadness in it could make me feel so joyful is a wonder.<br /><br />If I could give one piece of advice to someone picking up this book for the first time, it would be the advice I was given before I started reading it--pay close attention to the chapter headings and to the MANY subheadings that indicate the year and the ages of Henry and Clare at each point in time.  It will help you keep track of the timeline and be less confused. :)r /> <br />If I could give one piece of advice to someone picking up this book for the first time, it would be the advice I was given before I started reading it--pay close attention to the chapter headings and to the MANY subheadings that indicate the year and the ages of Henry and Clare at each point in time.

Not being a reader of horror, I had never read a Stephen King book before this one.  However, I have really come to look forward to his brutally honest and often hilarious monthly column in Entertainment Weekly magazine.  So, when a book chat pal recommended \\"On Writing\\" and further recommended the audio version, my interest was piqued.  I had a 14-hour round trip car trip coming up and really needed a book on tape that would keep my interest.  I ordered \\"On Writing\\" and off I went on my road trip.  I found myself smiling and sometimes laughing at King's reminisces of his childhood and his early works of writing in the first half of the book.  Having been writing as a hobby for 4 decades, I found his guidance on the tools of the writing trade very interesting and helpful.<br /><br />Other than finding out, mid-trip while going 70 MPH on I-70, that disk 7 of 8 was missing from the Audio CD package I bought (awww, maaaan!), I enjoyed every minute of the road trip while listening to this book.  Highly recommend it both as a memoir and as a treatise on the art and craft of writing.  One thing you can guarantee--you will hear it exactly as King thinks about it.  This man does NOT mince words!  I love his honesty and guts and I can't imagine listening to ANYONE read those words but him (the audio CD is read by King himself).	2004-08-29

I'm the type of person who reads in short \\"spurts\\" and, therefore, it tends to take me close to a month to finish a book.  While The Secret Life of Bees was certainly a smaller book than some I've read this year, I don't think it was JUST its size that led me to WHOOOSH through it so quickly.  It grabbed my interest from page 1 (quite uncommon) and held it all the way to the last page.  It made me laugh out loud and cry and raise my hand to my mouth in surprise.  It is a rich and engaging story as warm as the honey that runs through its pages.  Its charactes are wonderful and colorful people...people you'd want to know if they really existed!<br /><br />I didn't lose my mother in the same way Lily did, but my mother did leave the family when I was about Lily's age.  I could so relate to the feeling that I was somehow responsible for my father's anger and sadness, and perhaps even deserving of his meanness toward me.  My heart ached for Lily in her longing for her mother.  My heart swelled for Lily when she found people who gave her the love she deserved and built her back up to believe in herself and her absolute right to be loved.<br /><br />There are those stories and those characters that you feel a whole in your heart for when the book ends.  This story and these characters certainly meet that definition.  I wish I had been fortunate enough to meet August when I was a child.	2004-08-28

When I came to amazon this spring to buy a cookbook by one of my favorite Food Network hosts, amazon pitched Diet Simple in one of its &quot;If you buy this, you can get this for only this much.&quot; promotions.  Being authored by a nutritionist, I figured it was worth a shot for a few bucks more.  Um, not really.<br />The book is a series of &quot;diet&quot; tips.  I found the format annoying and not easy to refer back to something I'd read.  Unless you are just about to start your very first diet, you won't likely come away with much new information.  Granted, I've been around the diet block a number of times and have read quite a lot of diet/nutrition-related books over the years, so it wasn't like I expected that anything in this little book of tips would be earth-shattering news to me.  Still, I didn't come away feeling like I'd gained much from reading the book.<br />Though stress eating is not a major problem for me, I know a lot of people who struggle with it.  I did feel that her chapter on stress eating was quite good and helpful.<br />If you are just starting a diet or launching a healthy eating for life journey, you may find the book helpful in that you may be able to focus on just those tips that will give you the most &quot;bang for your buck.&quot;<br />However if, like me, you've been around the diet block a few times, I would recommend &quot;Thin for Life&quot; by Anne Fletcher.	2004-06-04

As a frequent mystery reader of authors like Deaver, Sandford and Cornwell, the thing that has impressed me most about these three books (and Ms. Burke) is that they are not only all good, engaging stories, but they are NOT all alike!  It is SO common for mystery writers' books to start feeling like carbon copies of one another (to the point that you have trouble remembering if you've read a particular book), but I have not found this the case with Ms. Burke so far.<br />Hocus involves the kidnapping of Irene Kelly's husband, Frank.  This kidnapping isn't about ransome or making some political statement...it has a VERY personal reason.  As the kidnappers lead Irene in putting together the puzzle of her husband's capture, we learn more about the kidnappers themselves and how their history and Frank's are connected.  This sets up not only the obvious emotional connection of a wife trying to find her husband before the kidnappers carry out their threats but also the connection of the kidnappers to Frank.  As the sad layers of this mystery unfold, police negotiator Cassidy helps Irene understand the mind of the kidnappers.  Her sharp reporter's mind and his understanding of the kidnappers' psychology pull them closer to unearthing Frank's location...but will it be in time?<br />While, like most any mystery novel, there is a little eye-rolling and suspension of disbelief involved, I found this a taut and engaging story with some great characters (loved the Cassidy character).  Brought it home from work (where I was reading it on my lunch hour) when I got down to 50 pages since I couldn't wait until after the weekend to get to the end! :)	2004-06-01

After reading two highly recommended novels that I had to struggle to get through (though they were well written, I found them boring), I SO needed a book that I could be immediately drawn into and fully enjoy...Middlesex came along at the right time.  I was captured from page one through the last page, and found the writing to be deliciously descriptive.  In fact, I left several little sticky notes throughout the book as I read to mark passages that left a particular mark on me.<br />To give you an idea how good this book is and how much it kept my attention, this was what I call my \\"work book\\"--a book I take to work and leave there to read on my lunch hour.  A \\"work book\\" almost NEVER comes home until I've finished it, but Middlesex came home with me the past two weekends because I couldn't bear to leave Calliope and her family behind when I left the office on Friday afternoon.<br />Middlesex is a truly unique story that defies description (yes, it's about a hermaphrodite but it is about SO much more than that).  It is about history and self-exploration and family and genetics and being different...just to start.  Most definitely worth a read...I finished it 8 hours ago and I still have a glow inside and feel sad that it's over.	2004-03-06

I find myself conflicted...occupying the middle ground between the &quot;love it&quot; and &quot;hate it&quot; camps.<br />Yes, absolutely, it is schmaltzy.  I sometimes found myself getting annoyed at how hard Albom was working to make me care about Eddie...to be meaningful...or to play with my emotions.

I have now read 6 or 8 of the novels in the Prey series and I have to give it to John Sandford for consistently delivering satisfying and entertaining novels.  This one, in fact, has one of the more satisfying endings of any novel in recent memory (anti-climactic perhaps, but nonetheless satisfying).<br />Whereas most of the Prey series takes place in or near Minneapolis, Lucas Davenport's home base, and includes a predictable cast of characters (Weather, Marcy, Del, Anne Marie), this novel takes place mostly in and around St. Louis, where Lucas takes the FBI's offer to help track down the notorious contract killer, Clara Rinker.  Most of the usual characters play a very lowkey role in this book but that's okay, because there is a new and interesting cast to supplant them.<br />Deep within himself, Lucas respects how flawlessly Clara is able to pull off her jobs and still evade the authorities.  Like many of the law enforcement officials he works with on the case, he really wants to bring down Clara Rinker.  Unlike most of his colleagues, he sees her humanity.  He knows where she comes from...what kind of haunted life...and he can't help but feel sorry for the kind of childhood that led her to this.<br />This is a little different side of Lucas...more introspective...less of the ladie's man and the joker.  I really liked it...it was a nice change of pace.	2004-01-12

I have been heavy pretty much my whole life (I'm 51) and have dieted and gained countless times.  I've read MANY books about weight loss and have found some helpful, but I have never felt such a profound benefit as I have gained from Thin for Life.  This may not be the perfect book for someone who needs an extremely prescriptive plan...every step written out for you, every morsel of food planned and scripted.  But, if like me, you are mostly going it on your own and you are looking for tools and resources to help you, this is THE PERFECT BOOK.<br />What could be more motivational than a bunch of people who have not only lost weight but kept it off?  I don't agree with every single person's methods of either getting it off or keeping it off; however, COLLECTIVELY, their advice is gold.  SO helpful.  If you are looking for that elusive key to doing this RIGHT for once and for all, READ THIS BOOK.  If you just want validation that you're already on the right track, READ THIS BOOK!<br />Thank you to Ms. Fletcher and to all the &quot;masters&quot;...you have touched me, inspired me and shown me that thin for life does not have to be a fantasy.  And for that, I am forever grateful.	2004-01-09
US	52680532	R43GFA3X3RHDQ	044661193X	628573598	Basket Case	Books	4	1	2	N	N	One of Hiaasen's better novels.	The first Hiaasen I ever read was \\"Sick Puppy,\\" which I enjoyed immensely.  The problem with reading a really entertaining book as your first by an author is that the others have a harder time living up to the first.  Intentional or not, every Hiaasen novel I've read since (there have been many) has been measured against \\"Sick Puppy\\" and very few measure up.<br />\\"Basket Case\\" comes closer than most...I loved its main character Jack Tagger, a neurotic (about dying) but ballsy news guy who has been busted down to writing obits for...well, being ballsy.  He sinks his teeth into a bizarre mystery surrounding the death of a washed-up (literally) rock star who he once admired in the hopes of getting back onto page 1 of the newspaper.<br />The mystery is intriguing, there is a very sexy side story (Jack, you naughty boy!), and the way it all wraps up is QUITE satisfying!  I was very pleased to once again finish a Hiaasen novel and go \\"YES! Now that's what I'm talkin' about!\\"	2003-11-17

Cannie, the main character of &quot;Good in Bed,&quot; is a large woman.  She's also smart, witty, sensitive and loving.  But what Bruce, her ex-boyfriend, takes away from the relationship is how brave he was to have loved a &quot;larger woman,&quot; and this is what he writes about in his article in a Cosmo-like magazine.  Obviously, Cannie is not only humilitated but mad beyond words when she learns of this article.  But living well is the best revenge, and Cannie does her best to move her life beyond the hurt and embarassment that Bruce's article initially brings her.<br />There aren't many books that I can relate to as much as this one.  Yea, it's fluff...but it also has a message--we are about more than just our bodies.  When men, or anyone for that matter, define us by our weight, they miss out on SO much.<br />Cannie's story is both hilarious and heart-breaking...and my only criticism is that the first half of the book (which had me laughing out loud in bed) feels like a completely different book from the second half (which is mostly tragic and sad).  I certainly don't mind mixing comedy and drama, but usually they're inter-mixed versus a total gear-shift from one part of the book to the other.  Still, I gave the book 4 stars for its humor and positive message.	2003-08-11

At age 40, after a life of yo-yo dieting and gaining more and more weight, I ejected the word &quot;diet&quot; from my life.  I started making changes toward a healthier lifestyle...and I HAVE made changes, just not enough of them.  So KD's book (and support and guidance from the Cooking Thin discussion board) was really instrumental in helping me take that next step.<br />Kathleen has been there...she's been heavy, she's lost it, she's kept it off.  Is it easy for her?  No.  But she keeps at it.  Her philosophy is to change your life in baby steps, to eat foods in moderation instead of completely denying yourself the foods you love and, of course, making exercise a regular part of your life.  These things will increase your chances of making a PERMANENT shift to healthier eating and living.<br />I'm not much of a recipe person (I tend to make things up as I go along), but I have already learned a lot from her book.  Because I am a very picky eater, I usually look at most recipes and go &quot;Nah, I wouldn't ever cook that.&quot; or &quot;Well, MAYBE I could cook that but I'd leave out a lot of ingredients I don't like.&quot;  But when I paged through KD's book that first day...I was amazed to find that I would want to eat most of what was in there.  Now THAT surprised me.  Granted, it doesn't have nutrition information and that would have been helpful but, to me, this book is valuable enough to stand without it.	2003-06-20

Jeffery Deaver is probably my favorite fiction author of the mystery/thriller genre.  On the whole, I find his writing excellent, his characters well-drawn, and his mastery of suspense and plot twists superior.<br />The thing I found so interesting about Stone Monkey is that it has a unique subject that was new to me--human smuggling.  Specifically, the smuggling of Chinese immigrants (mostly dissidents) into America.  There is a whole new world to learn about in this book...on top of the good writing and suspense.  There is not only the world of human smuggling to learn about but Asian culture.  I'm sure Mr. Deaver used some dramatic license in relating some of these facts, but I was still quite impressed at the research he must have done to write this book.<br />The character of Sonny Li, a Chinese detective who comes to America undercover as an illegal immigrant to try to catch the notorious smuggler The Ghost, was a breath of fresh air.  He was funny and brash and smart, and I loved that he spoke his mind and didn't treat Rhyme as either a fragile flower or a god.  I came to really admire and care for this character.<br />I wouldn't say this is Deaver's best work, but it's still an excellent book and I think that the unique and interesting storyline really adds a lot to the reading experience.	2003-06-13
US	52680532	R2TFBALAERT9L1	0451202473	91466535	Bones	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A creepy good story with lots of twists and characters.	Being a fan of Jeffery Deaver and Patricia Cornwell, this book was recommended to me by a fellow reader.  I had read Burke's &quot;Flight&quot; last year and quite enjoyed it, but found &quot;Bones&quot; a very different kind of story.  &quot;Flight&quot; was more of a human interest story with a mystery thrown in, whereas &quot;Bones&quot; definitely enters Deaver &quot;grisly and creepy serial killer book&quot; territory.<br />Burke's ongoing character Irene Kelly, a feisty journalist, is part of a team of mostly cops and forensic specialists going on a mountain trek with a serial killer to find the body of a victim he says he buried there.  Thus begins a harrowing, tragic and creepy cat-and-mouse game that will keep you reading (and maybe even keep you awake) until the end.<br />I guess my only criticism would be that the book is packed with such an enormous cast of characters that it is sometimes difficult to keep them straight (this is more in the first half, though).  Fortunately, the later part of the story focuses most of its attention on 4 or 5 of them so it's easier to follow.<br />The book's villain is not one you're likely to forget soon!	2003-04-24

Let me say from the outset (because I have a feeling this review may ruffle some feathers) that I enjoyed this book (my first by Reichs) on the whole.  I thought the plot was well crafted, the tension was kept high, and the characters were, generally, interesting or colorful.<br />That said, if you're a writer (or even a nut about use of language), some elements of the writing may bug you as they did me (and also a friend of mine who was reading this at the same time I was).  For example, overuse of the main character berating herself with lines like &quot;Get a grip, Brennan!&quot; and overuse of similes and metaphors to the point of distraction.<br />Finally, though I am a long-time reader of books which include graphic violence from authors such as Cornwell, Deaver, Carr and others, I found this story more disturbing than most any I've read.  The victims are all women and the violence is very specifically directed toward women in a shocking way.  That's just a heads-up to those of you who may want to avoid that type of storyline.  She makes it real, that's one thing I'll give her!	2003-02-13
US	52680532	R106MAD4OE7OKI	0671024108	791325639	Speaking in Tongues	Books	2	2	3	N	N	A disappointment from one of my favorite authors.	Like one of the reviewers below, I began my love affair with Deaver by reading The Bone Collector.  Since then, I've read The Coffin Dancer, The Empty Chair, The Blue Nowhere and A Maiden's Grave and loved them all.  However, Speaking in Tongues felt to me like a book that was written when Deaver wasn't yet published and only got published because he is now a popular author.  The last 50-75 pages of this book are the only redeeming qualities in my opinion.<br />The story, about a fractured family and a troubled teen who gets kidnapped by a psycho shrink, had potential but the writing quality and characterizations were not up to Deaver standards.  Additionally, some of the things that happened in the story were ridiculously outlandish or way too convenient.<br />I certainly won't give up on Deaver because of one disappointing novel, but I do hope that this isn't the beginning of a downward spiral for Deaver as has happened with another of my favorite authors, Patricia Cornwell.	2002-12-20

This is an old book that was &quot;reworked&quot; and, IMHO, Ms. E should have let sleeping dogs lie.  The author appears to have done this reworking to give we Plum fans &quot;more of the same.&quot;  Sorry, but this is so NOT that.  I suppose if I was a fan of romance novels, this may have been a pleasant enough way to pass a few hours, but I'm not.  For a while, I wasn't even sure I was going to be able to finish it.  Granted, the last half isn't as bad as the first, but if this is what the author thinks readers of the Plum series want, I will be very wary of buying any more non-Plum Evanovich novels after having read this one.	2002-11-18

I think I may have been spoiled by the fact that the first Hiaasen I read was Sick Puppy.  That book made me laugh out loud.  Since then, I've read nearly a half dozen more books by Hiaasen and, while all were enjoyable, none have really reached the heights of enjoyment for me that Sick Puppy did.  Lucky You has the wacky characters and the environmentalist slant as usual but it just seemed to be working overtime to be wild and wacky...kind of a piling-on effect that became a bit obnoxious.  Not a BAD book, but a more mediocre one than I've come to expect from this author.	2002-11-18

I was just introduced to Hiaasen's books this year when I finally bought Sick Puppy after much prodding from several people.  I absolutely adored Sick Puppy and purchased Stormy Weather because I heard that the character of Skink also appeared in that book.  While I enjoyed the Stormy Weather, it didn't impress me on the same level as Sick Puppy and it took me much longer to finish this book--it just didn't grab me.  Skink is still one of the wackiest and coolest characters around and I hope to read more of his exploits some day.  But the other characters in Stormy Weather just weren't people I cared to read about.  Plus one of the things I loved about Sick Puppy is that it made me laugh out loud and I don't know that I laughed once during Stormy Weather (and perhaps it wasn't intended to be humorous).  I would still take a chance on other Hiassen books, but I probably won't do so without strong recommendations from people I know.	2001-06-21

I had no idea, when I found this book in a little beach bookstore recently, that it was written in 1955.  Had I known, it probably would have dissuaded me from buying it.  I now know how fortunate I am to have not known!<br />I believe that books, words and people come into our lives at the time they are most needed, and Gift from the Sea certainly fits that bill for me.  While small bits of it may be dated, most of it speaks as clearly and truly to modern day woman as it would have to 1950s women.  In fact, with so many women in search of their most authentic self these days, it may even be MORE relevant to today's woman!  It is a delicate and thoughtful essay on solitude, couplehood, inner peace and the wonder of nature.  I can't imagine anyone not being inspired and uplifted by reading it.

I'm so full of ideas and inspiration, thanks to Cheryl, that I now know which path to take...now it's up to me to stay on it.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/12/13: I read this book over 12 years ago and to this day, I not only remember it but I quote its concept of self care and offer its ideas to others. Cheryl's concept of the gift journal may be one of the things that has stayed with me the most. I kept 3 journals that year: 1 for my best friend, 1 for my assistant at work who was also a good friend, and 1 for myself. I gave the 2 gift journals for Christmas. The recipient of 1 journal was inspired to keep a journal for ME for the following year and gifted it to me the following Christmas. The recipient of the other journal wept when she received it, before she had ever read it. My own journal was important to me as well, since I was having a very tough year at work at that time and it helped me work out some emotions.<br /><br />I also used Cheryl's idea about making my work space more visually enjoyable and peaceful. As I said, I was going through a tough time at work then, so I put a lot of effort into making my cube as much of an oasis as I could. I had favorite photos of Hawaii enlarged and put them on my walls, I bought a small fountain and brought in a few items that meant a lot to me to bolster my spirit and I added plants. WOW.

It is rare that I finish reading a book and find myself conflicted on my opinion of it, but this is my dilemma with Timeline.  While more of a science fiction fan than a history fan, I enjoyed the medieval time travel element quite a bit.  It was engaging and had quite a lot of action to keep me interested.  The jumping back and forth between past and present kept the suspense at a relatively steady pace.  My disappointments were its over-reliance on technical information (which made for some dry reading at times), and its characters who, while not UNlikeable, just didn't make me care much what happened to them (except for Marek, who I really liked).  Having read almost every other book Crichton has written, I just didn't feel this was up to his usual standards.  However, if you are interested in the medieval period, Crichton's extensive bibliography alone would probably be worth the price of the paperback.	2000-12-23

It wasn't until I was two-third's of the way through (600 pages!!) that I really started to look forward to picking up the book at bedtime.  The last third of the book was fantastic and compelling.  I just resent having to slog through 600 pages (more than the size of the average book) to get to the good part.  I am glad that I persevered through my discouragement and finished the book.

It is amazing for 4 women in  one family to have so much in common and yet be such different people.  The  customs, traditions and folklore of this Haitian family were so primary as  to almost be characters in the story themselves.<br />I found this book to be  so charming and eloquent as to distract me from its flaws.  My only major  disappointment is that there couldn't have been a more positive way for  Sophie and her mother to escape the ghosts of their pasts.	1998-09-11

As a person who raved to her coworkers and friends relentlessly about  &quot;The Alienist&quot; being one of the best books of the past 5 years, I  was overwhelmingly disappointed by &quot;The Angel of Darkness.&quot;  The  story of Libby Hatch was intriguing, but the book plodded on and on until I  was begging for it to be over.  I normally would not even stay with a book  that slow, but knowing Carr's previous work, I assumed there HAD to be  something better coming.  Perhaps if &quot;Angel&quot; had been a tighter,  less rambling 350 pages or so instead of 750, it might have been enjoyable.	1998-09-09

While I was underwhelmed with this book at the beginning, it eventually reeled me in and got me involved with the characters and the mystery.  The climax of the book is quite tense and effective.  However, I was offended by some remarks made by the main character, psychologist Diane Cheung, during the final conflict.  I haven't quite decided whether these close-minded views are those of the character or the author himself.	1998-07-08

While I must admit a bit of disappointment with an ending that felt a little too pat and abrupt, I  really liked this book overall.  It reminded me a lot of &quot;The Alienist&quot; by Caleb Carr, which I thought was one of the best books of this genre that I've read.  As a forensics nut, I LOVED Deaver's attention to crime scene details, and that he reposted the latest list of clues every few chapters so that the reader could join right in with Rhyme, Sachs, and company in the hunt for the sadistic killer.  Bravo!	1998-05-22

When I bought Bob Green's book &quot;Make the Connection,&quot; I bought the companion journal as well.  The information in Bob's book, as well as Oprah's inspirational thoughts, was fantastic.  But it was the Journal that really made it real, made it personal to ME.  With Bob's help, I did something I never thought I'd do.  I started working out in the morning before work.  To supplement the exercise, I carried the Journal with me every day to work, documenting what I was eating, what my emotions were, how much water I drank, etc.  Words cannot express how important the Journal was to me.  It not only gave structure to my efforts, but it showed me patterns of stress eating and such that I could not have identified as clearly without the Journal.  Thank you!	1998-04-08

I am a regular reader of murder mystery novels, and the mystery element of this story sucked me right in.  The clever melding of the human and ant storylines kept me guessing as to how they would finally converge, and what the outcome would be.  If I have any criticism, it is that the human characters were not written as strongly as the ant characters.  I could not wait for lunch hour to come every day so I could see what dangers and adventures lie ahead for 357 and the other ant characters.  I wanted so much for them to survive and to succeed at uncovering the mysteries they were investigating.  I never thought I'd be shedding tears for ants, but this book made me care deeply for these noble characters and feel sad when one of them succumbed to life's ever-present dangers.  Don't waste energy comparing this book to &quot;Watership Down.&quot;  Just enjoy it for what it is.	1998-03-31
US	52680532	R19BPKHJPFSGWX	0684195984	103272092	From Potter's Field	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of the best of its kind!	This is only my second Cornwell novel, and I have already been won over.  From Potter's Field was even better than Body Farm, and it was nice to get to know the characters even better this time around.  My only criticism is that I'd like to see more likeable characters.  So many of them are hard-edged or not very warm, which is also true of Dr. Kay, though I do like that she is a strong, capable woman.  Unlike others, I don't see Kay's affair with Wesley as some moral affront.  While I don't say it's right, it is part of real life, and  it helps to show Kay's softer, more vulnerable side.  The buildup to the climax was nail-biting. More, more, more!  :)	1998-01-24

As a voracious reader, I find that many books disappear from my memory pretty quickly. This book really touched me--it made me think...care...feel ...cry.  I have passed it on to 5 of my coworkers so far, and it's still going.  Every single one of them loved it, and I love getting to talk to them about it after they finish.  Mr. Gaines, my thanks for a truly inspiring piece of work.	1998-01-15

It's been about a year since I read The Alienist, but I couldn't help but add my review.  This book gripped me and pulled me right in--it's as if I was sitting in front of the chalkboard and helping unearth clues with the rest of the team.  This book was intense and horrifyingly graphic, but I couldn't be put off from finishing it.  Because of this book, I am now an avid reader of serial killer novels.  I've read some very interesting books, but none have captivated and stayed with me like The Alienist.	1998-01-15
