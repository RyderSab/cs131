Vernon Halliday and Clive Linley are old buddies. After the funeral of a mutual friend, Molly Lane, who died after a debilitating disease, they promise each other to help the other commit euthanasia if they ever become incapacitated. And then their friendship starts to unravel: Vernon is the editor-in-chief of a good newspaper who, pressured by the ever decreasing sales of the last year, decides to publish pictures of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a compromising situation. Clive thinks this is very unethical. On the other hand there is Clive, a composer, who during a hiking trip in the Lake District, witnesses a crime, but refuses to go to the police. Vernon considers this unethical. In the end the two \\"friends\\" meet in Amsterdam. Apparently to become friends again, but they both have a surprise for the other... <br /> <br />Quite and entertaining read, but I am not sure that this is actually the level of a Booker Prize winner. Atonement by Ian McEwan was a much more complicated novel with more levels in it.	2005-10-13

As part of his rehabilitation he roams the streets of his neighbourhood, where one day he finds the Paper Palace, a stationary shop where he buys a blue Portuguese notebook from the Chinese owner. When he gets home he immediately starts to write a story about a man who one day walks out on his wife and disappears without a trace. But after a while he gets stuck and does not know how to continue. In the meantime he finds out that his wife is pregnant, his house is broken into, he endangers his marriage when he encounters the Chinese shopowner Mr  Chang again, his best friend, the renowned author John Trause, has health problems and the son of this best friend ends up in a rehab centre. And all that in the timespan of nine days. As Sidney tries to cope with all this he needs his blue notebook to make sense of all the developments. <br /> <br />This book gets mixed reviews on Amazon and I see the problems that some people have with the two relatively unfinished story lines. Paul Auster can definitely write: even though the story as such was not terribly interesting to me (except for the story within the story of the guy who disappears without a trace), the book is so well-written that I was simply forced to read on.	2005-10-10

At the start of the book she is busy digging up people after a dam has burst in Colorado. When she tries to take a good picture of the disaster area, she witnesses something she was not supposed to see and a full-fledged manhunt to kill her is set into motion. Luckily one of her friends is the wife of a billionaire, who (against her will) provides her with a bodyguard, one Judd Morgan. He is unfathomable and Alex is a real tough woman, so they fight tooth and nail about Alex' safety and freedom of movement. It quickly becomes clear that the dam burst in Colorado was only the first event in a series and that there is nowhere where they are safe: the CIA, FBI and national security service are all trying to get Alex, so they constantly have to be on the move. And meanwhile a pathological killer tries to get his hands on Judd. In short, all the ingredients are there for a thriller, including some romance, but this book is not really outstanding because the storylines are too artificial.	2005-10-06

And by doing this he can give a very good description of historically important events in the area. It worked very well for London, Sarum and The Forest, but I have to say it works less for Russka: at times the stories are long, making them slightly boring and the rivalries between the families are more important than the historical events. There are some interesting chapters, notably Forest and Steppe, Ivan (the Terrible), Peter (the Great) and Revolution, but I had to struggle through some of the other chapters. And then 945 pages is quite a lot...	2005-10-01

Only inventiveness and sheer luck prevent him from being shot as well. The Russian people have decided that they want to reinstate the Tsar and Lord is working for an American law firm that is helping one of the Romanov contenders for the throne. But apparently he has stumbled onto something important because the killers keep trying to murder him. He wants to get to the bottom of it all and he teams up with Akilina, a Russian acrobat. Together they are the Raven and the Eagle, who, according to one of Rasputin's prophecies, will reinstall the Romanov's on the Russian throne. In the end they succeed, but before that they travel halfway over the world and a lot of people are killed in the process. <br /> <br />The author has very obviously studied the style of Dan Brown, but I liked Brown better, even tohugh it is difficult to say why. A decent read while on holiday, even though the endless chases are tiring at times. I was also surprised by the fact that it takes Lord, who seems to be quite bright, such a long time to work out who the villain is behind it all. The historical background is actually quite adequate, which means that the reader can get a good insight into the end of the Romanovs and the beginning of the Communist rule.	2005-10-01

During the liberation struggle the old men are replaced by soldiers - both male and female- that take a rest here. But it becomes apparent in the book that a lot of these soldiers are quite deranged. One such soldier kills a girl, Thenjiwe, and mutilates her sister, Nonceba. After a long stay in the hospital, where she tries to regain her physical well-being and mental health, Nonceba follows the ex-lover Cephas of her dead sister to Bulawayo, where they live as brother and sister, two people forever wounded by the war of independence. <br /> <br />When written this way the book seems to hold a lot of promise for a very moving book. However, it took me nearly the whole book to get into the story. Yvonne Vera uses a lot of metaphors in which she couples different senses: she describes sounds in visual terms, tastes  she compares to sounds etc and the book is really packed with this. I really had problems understanding what was going on to a point that it actually got me very irritated. However, the end of the book (with the least metaphors) is a very loving description of two hurt people trying to make the most of their lives.	2005-09-05

Harry is Captain of the Quidditch team, Ron and Hermione are prefects, but life is not perfect: there is trouble with love, but the main problem is that the dark forces are getting stronger and stronger, so much so that they even threaten the students inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore helps Harry to get a better idea about the life and peculiarities of Lord Voldemort, but in the end Harry is left alone with his friends to fight off the evil forces. <br /> <br />Even though the Harry Potter books are less surprising than in the beginning (one cannot go on endlessly inviting new and exiting games and gadgets), it is still a very solid book with no loose ends left after the grand finale. Maybe the start of the book is a little bit slow, but I am sure that we will need all the information when Harry tries to defeat Lord Voldemort permanently in book 7. <br />	2005-08-15

After two introductory chapters, the core nine chapters describe the situation of public health on the various continents. The last chapters cover the newly emerging threat of bioterrorism, ethical issues and the future. The book gives a concise overview of the current state of global public health. I liked the chapter on ethical dilemmas: very down to earth discussion of a topic that can easily lead to emotional rather than rational discussions.  <br /> <br />One small criticism is that the authors of the nine core chapters apparently did not get clear instructions on what to cover in their respective chapters, which lead to chapters that diverse rather widely from very epidemiology-oriented chapters (China) to chapters that use more a health systems approach (North America). But all in all this book gives a good overview of current trends and issues, probably well known to public health specialists, but interesting enough for people with an interest in public health.	2005-08-10

But it is very difficult to track him down: a bank robber has taken him hostage and hides with him in the woods. Somehow Erkki and the bank robber get attached to each other until a freak accident happens...  <br /> <br />People around me really loved this book, but to me it was a little bit too much like Nicci French: the emphasis on the literary side and not enough suspense.	2005-08-10

In the meantime inspector Erlendur and his colleagues try to get a picture of what happened 50 to 70 years ago. Slowly but surely they find out the awful truth. In between the story line of the investigation, there is another storyline about a family consisting of a father, mother, 2 brothers and a handicapped sister. It soon becomes apparent that something horrible happened in the family and this is written down so vividly that I had to put down the book a few times because it nearly became too much. An in the meantime Erlendur's drugs-addicted daughter Eva Lind is in a coma and he finally finds the courage to tell her what he feels for her. In short, this is a wonderful, sensitive thriller with a lot of psychological insight, well-developed storylines and beautiful descriptions of the various characters.	2005-08-09

These meetings are used by the author to tell the readers about the backgrounds of the different characters and their interrelationships. The book is actually more about the present-day characters than about the books of Jane Austen and the observations are every now and then quite funny.  <br /> <br />It may be that Jane Austen adepts actually pick up a lot of points that may refer to Jane Austen novels, but I got this book as a present after stating that \\"I absolutely hate Jane Austen\\" (it was a compulsory read in highschool), so these clues would pass me by. All in all this book was enjoyable to read, but because 6 characters were discussed in the space of barely 250 pages, it remained kind of shallow. The last 50 pages of the book provide a lot of information on Jane Austen's books, but I have to admit that neither the abstracts of the books nor the discussions in the main body of the novel inspire me to take up Jane Austen again.	2005-07-25

Gerald Fedden, Toby's father, is a Tory MP whose star is rising and who is obsessed with Maggie Thatcher. Meanwhile Nick is chasing his own obsession: beautiful men. In the first part of the book, 1983, he has a secret relationship with Leo, a black council worker whose mother is extremely christian. In the second and third parts of the book (1986 and 1987) Nick has a relationship with a Wani, a Lebanese men whose filthy rich parents are not supposed to know either. While Gerald and the Fedden family are having their own problems, ultimately leading to the downfall of the family, Nick has to cope with secret sex, tons of cocaine and the ravage that AIDS causes in the gay community. <br /> <br />Alle these are ingredients for a very touching novel, but somehow \\"Line of beauty\\" never gripped me: everything stays at the surface. The only person causing some depth is actually Catherine, the manic-depressive daughter of the family, whose caustic remarks on the life and friends of her parents are hilarious and sad at the same time. Nick is the type of person who always wants to please other people by making non-commital remarks, hardly ever going against the flow or raising an objection to anything and Gerald Fedden is so superficial that he probably invented the word. If Alan Hollinghurst wants how people live and react in a very superficial world, he certainly succeeded in that, but you never get any insight into the feelings of the characters. For example, the AIDS item, which could have added a emotional dimension to the novel because the gay community was very scared in the eighties, was in my opinion not fully exploited. This winner of the Booker Prize 2004 seems to have everything in it to become a classic, but somehow I did not see it.	2005-07-17

For most of the book the question remains whether the three cases are interconnected, until everything is solved within 24 hours. Because of all the different cases the book is rather messy and it also takes until two-thirds of the book before the detective work starts to give any serious results.

His dream is to visit Africa. During the 1960's it was still normal that men were not present at the birth of their children, so when his wife is in labour, Bird roams through the city. Eventually he gets the message that the child is born, but the boy has a severely deformed head. Even before he has properly found out what the problem is Bird gets an enormous attack of self-pity, he visits a good (female) friend, starts a session of binge drinking, loses his job and sleeps with the girlfriend, all the while ignoring the needs of his wife and new-born son. He brings his son (who he has not even given a name yet) to the university clinic where, together with the doctor, he decides to let the baby starve to death. Only days later, after a lot of self-pity, sleeping sessions with his girl-friend and because the baby more or less refuses to die Bird finally takes his responsibility. <br /> <br />This is a very well-written book, but the behaviour of Bird is very irritating, childish and egocentric, seen from the perspective of a western woman in 2005. It is difficult to decide whether Bird's behaviour is determined by time (the book is 40 years old and the [Japanese] viewpoint on certain matters may have changed), culture (the Japanese may look differently on handicapped children and the role of men taking care of babies) or person (Bird is just a childish, egocentric jerk).	2005-05-15

The difference with most children is that she has never known her father and mother and that the grown ups around her know that she is destined to do something important. And then children start to disappear from Oxford: the rumour goes that they are abducted by Gobblers. After a spell with the seemingly nice but demanding Mrs Coulter, Lyra is intent to free the abducted children, a quest that takes her to the North Pole. <br /> <br />So far everything seems pretty normal, but Lyra's universe is only partially like ours: every human being has a daemon: an animal that stays near to you and represents your soul. Without such a daemon a person loses his personality and may ultimately die. And witches, armoured polar bears and ferocious Tartans inhabit Lyra's world. She also has an alethiometer, a kind of clock that can answer any question one has. With the help of the alethiometer, gyptians, witches, an exiled polar bear and a lot of inventiveness she is capable of freeing the children, but her quest takes her still further until she reaches the end of the world where she has to make a very difficult decision. <br /> <br />This book is the first of the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, a series often compared to the Harry Potter books. There is a lot to enjoy: action, suspense and this book is less childish, but I like the Harry Potter books better as the events in the Harry Potter books are more archetypical: more black and white, good and evil, which for this type of books is good. Also the end of Northern Lights is so open that it practically forces the reader to buy the second book of the series.	2005-03-02

It is inhabited by Christians, Muslims, Armenians and Jews, like most villages in what will once become Turkey. The people live peacefully together: the muslims ask their Christian neighbours to pray for them in front of the icon of Mary in the local church, the Christians bury their dead with a piece of the Koran, just in case. Small boys play together on their clay birdwhistles, Ali the Snowbringer and his donkey provide ice to the population, Iskander the Potter makes their pots and pans, the gendarmes play endless games of backgammon and Philothei is kindly asked to wear a veil because her beauty makes the men crazy. In short, business is pretty much as usual.  <br /> <br />And then life in Eskibahce is changed forever by the bigger events of history: the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the First World War, the war of indepence against Greece all leave deep and irrepairable cuts in the social life of Eskibahce: first the Armenians are deported, then the rest of the Christians, who are now considered to be Greeks, even though they do not speek a word of Greek, are shipped to Greece and the village gets a bunch of Greek Muslims who do not speak a word of Turkish in return. <br /> <br />All these developments are seen through the eyes of the simple villagers, with some chapters decribing the rise of Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) to put everything in a historical perspective. And the reader starts to love the village and its inhabitants: despite the gross injustices they sometimes commit, the killings, the stoning of an unfaithful woman, they all have their beautiful sode, even the grumpy school teacher who dreams of restoring the Greek Empire in Turkey. Louis de Bernires has written a true masterpiece: a  story that makes you want to read on and on and at the same time a book explaining the history of one of the most instable areas in modern history.	2005-02-28

The team of policemen and -women seems to be always one step behind and even the profiler that has come to help them has problems coming up with a good profile of the killer. <br /> <br />What makes this book special is that the reader also gets the perspective of the killer: it soon becomes clear who he is and why he does what he is doing. This could be a major handicap as the book may loose most of its excitement of the \\"whodunnit\\", but here this is not the case. This is mainly due to the fact that Kurt Wallander is a full-fetched character with good and bad traits, doubts, hypochondric moments and moments of sudden,clear insight, making it a pleasure to follow how, in the end, he solves the case.	2005-02-02

In the eyes of the American people he was a tragic hero: the good-looking airmail pilot who was the first one to cross the Atlantic by plane and whose infant son was kidnapped only a few years later. So a man with charisma who would certainly have had a chance to beat Roosevelt and who only at the last moment decided not to be the nominee for the republican party. But also a man who admired Hitler and Nazi Germany and hated non-Arian people. If he would have been elected it would have been questionable whether America had joined the war against Germany and the Jews (and other groups of people in America) might have suffered serious repercussions from Linbergh's Nazi ideas. <br /> <br />Philip Roth grew up as a Jewish boy in Newark, on the East Coast of America. In 1940 he was 7 years old and the novel describes what the lives of him and his family members might have been like if Lindbergh had won the presidential elections. And all of this seen through the eyes of a surprised, scared 7 to 9 year old, who does not completely understands what is going on, but who knows that it is not as it should be and that it is scary and dangerous. <br /> <br />Choosing to keep the story \\"close to home\\" (taking the history of his family as a starting point) and describing the events through the eyes of a small, scared boy, is what makes this book so impressive: slowly but surely one sees the effects of the discrimination seeping into the daily life of the family, probably very analogous to what actually happened to many Jews in Hitler Germany after 1933. <br /> <br />It is a real pity that the book ends in somewhat of an anticlimax: the \\"solution\\" comes falling from the blue (not the appropriate term here) and the effects are profound, but the perspective of the little boy is left, which makes the book loose power of conviction at the end. But definitely worth a read.	2005-01-30

His editor, Keser, tries to find out why he killed himself, for which he needs to trace the whereabouts of a manuscript by B. Meanwhile it becomes more and more clear that B. is a victim of Auschwitz: he was born in Auschwitz and the rest of his life is devoted to the question whether a man is alllowed to live after surviving Auschwitz. And in the background there is the play in which B. has described very precisely how the people near him will react after his death.    The title of the book \\"Liquidation\\" is very appropriately chosen: Auschwitz killed millions of Jews, B. makes the life of his wife Judith impossible, communism gets wiped out, the publishing house for which B. and Keser work goes broke, B. commits suicide, after ending his life he causes a big crisis in Judith' second marriage and the manuscript of his novel is liquidated. A beautifully written book that leaves both the reader and Keser empty-handed and with a lot of questions.	2004-12-07

The trail that Harry finds when going through Terry's files leads him into the desert of Nevada and into the hands of the FBI, who are unearthing a mass burial site of The Poet, the serial killer that featured in the book that made Michael Connelly world famous. Together with fallen-from-grace FBI agent Rachel Walling Bosch follows the trail of The Poet to a small brothel-town and from there to Los Angeles, all the time running into gruesome killings that are the hallmark of The Poet. The apotheosis of the book happens in the pouring rain.

At the same time a new technology that may lead to widespread destruction is stolen from CERN. Together with the adopted daughter of the priest Robert travels to Rome to try and solve the riddle that involves the infamous Illuminati brotherhood, a secret society seeking to destroy the Roman Catholic Church. Right at that moment the cardinals of the church are trying to elect a new pope and Robert and Vittoria chase the murderer around Rome in a race against the clock to prevent the annihilation of Vatican City. But all is not what it seems to be and the main danger comes from within Vatican City... <br /> <br />This book again contains the themes that made Dan Brown world famous: secret codes, ancient brotherhoods and a serious threat to mankind and its institutions. Not as good as the Da Vinci Code, but still a nice book to read that never gets dull.	2004-11-14

Jean-Claude Romand seems to have a well-organized life: he is a successful doctor at the World Health Organization in Geneva with a beautiful house, loving wife, two nice kids and a lover on the side. That is, until he kills his wife and children on a Saturday afternoon in January 2003, murders his parents and their dogs and attempts to kill his lover before he half-heartedly tries to commit suicide (and remove any remaining traces of the crimes). Then it becomes clear that his life was one big lie: he is not a successful doctor but a medicine student that did not finish his education and who for the past 18 years pretended to be successful, but spent his days reading in the car or hiking in the mountains while everybody thinks he is working. He \\"earns\\" a living by pretending to make profitable long-term financial deals for family and friends with Swiss banks, while he is in reality using up this money for his daily expenses. And then the moment comes when people start to realize that there is something fishy going on. All in all it is a miracle that this took 18 years...<br /><br />Emmanuel Carr&egrave;re reconstructed this real (!) story based on court reports, interviews, meetings and even correspondence with the murderer. This is an intriguing and terrifying glimpse into the soul (if present) of a psychopath.	2004-11-02

After a trip that brings Edgar, who has never left England before, to exotic places like Alexandria, Aden en India, he arrives in Burma, where everything is different. But somehow he seems to cope very well, really eager to learn the habits of the country and its people.When the trip to his final destination, Mae Lwin, is endlessly postponed for unknown reasons, he travels illegally to the idyllic hamlet. He meets the doctor and his lovely Burmese girlfriend, tunes the piano and gets caught up in political intrigues that he cannot begin to fathom. In the end his love for Burma leads to his downfall. <br /> <br />A beautifully written book, lovely to read about Burma and amazing that a young American writer can capture the atmosphere of 19th century London so convincingly. A shame that the intrigues with regard to the uprising of the Shan states are so scarcely described that the end of the book was incomprehensible from a political point of view, even though I understood the human aspect of Edgar's downfall.	2004-10-10

Zach Herney has been under heavy siege by his opponent, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, for the recent failures and over expenditures of NASA. The president hires a team of civilian scientists to confirm the find and also asks the daughter of Sexton, Rachel Sexton who is an analyst for a state security agency, to confirm the authenticity of the meteorite. When they ultimately find a flaw, things start to unravel fast: someone definitely wants does not want their finding to become public knowledge and is prepared to kill them to prevent this from happening. What follows is a race across the globe between three ingenious people and a heavily armed team of killers. In the meantime a number of political games are being played in Washington that leave the reader guessing at who is the bad guy behind all this.<br /><br />Even though the story is less credible than the Da Vinci Code by the same author, it is still an enjoyable read. The story takes a while to get properly started but once all the characters are in place, events follow each other up at breakneck speed. Nice book to read during a holiday on the beach or a long winter weekend next to the fire.	2004-10-07

He meets Pavel's landlady and her unpleasant daughter and he also finds out that things are not the way they seem to be: Pavel's death (he had fallen to his death) is less clear than it appears. Fjodor finds out that Pavel was part of the entourage of the vague, anarchistic Netsjajev, who now also wants to use Dostojevski. The police suspects this and sends a police spy who is dressed as a beggar to see what Dostojevski is doing while in St. Petersburg. And in the meantime Dostojevski has to come to terms with the unexpected death of a son that he loved dearly, but that did not love his stepfather in return. <br /> <br />I read the book while in St. Petersburg and the Russian atmosphere is very well described, but all the main characters, side characters and psychological twists and turns do not make this book very easy to read.	2004-10-07

In this book Giles Foden, who specilizes in turning African historical events into 'faction' novels, takes these attacks as the basis of a thriller in which a number of apparently unconnected stories, in which the protagonists (a Greek-American oceanologist, an intelligence veteran with only one arm, an ambitious young civil servant and and African boy whose parents are murdered) are finally all part of one big story that cost the lives of more than 200 people. Giles Foden gives a good description of the wheelings and dealings of African (and American) bureaucracy, but also a very interesting and not much known insight into the birth of Al-Qaida, when it was still an American-sponsored resistance movement in Russian-occupied Afghanistan. Not exactly an episode of history that is very fondly remembered by the American government. Definitely worth a read.	2004-09-03

And worst of all, Alice and Phillip have this absolutely wonderful, creative gay couple of friends who always come up with The Perfect Gift. Phillip becomes obsessed with giving perfect gifts in return, but somehow he fails most of the time (for example: buying a beautiful organic food picknick hamper including an enormous smoked ham for a vegetarian). In the process of finding the perfect gift he nearly loses all that is dear to him in life. <br /> <br />The book starts of as a really nice read, but after the first part (halfway through the book), the developments become either more of the same or unrealistic and, despite the sometimes hilarious character sketches, the last half of the book could not really hold my attention.	2004-08-13

Simon Winchester describes the geological features that led to this catastrophe, as well as the events in 1883 from the first rumblings in May until the final explosion in August. He also describes the aftermath: the rise of a new volcano, &quot;Anak Krakatoa&quot; (the Child of Krakatoa), the repopulation of both the remnants of the previous volcano and the new volcano and a host of wider ranging subjects varying from the invention of water-proof telegraphic cables with which the news was sent to the rest of the world to the uprising of fundamentalist Islamic hadjis in the wake of the eruption. This is the main shortcoming of this book: sometimes the detours are too long-winded and the information provided does not add all that much to the main story.

They have a nice house, Frank has a job that is not too demanding and they have two small kids, so in essence all a couple can wish. Except, that they are not happy at all: April has not become the actress she wanted to be, they consider their neighbours and friends to be narrow-minded and they have fights over small matters that become so big that it is practically impossible to cope with it. In a last attempt to escape April decides that the family will move to Europe: she will work and Frank will finally have time to develop his talents. Frank does not exactly want to go, but he does not know how to tell his wife. And so the family heads for disaster without anybody noticing or knowing what to do about it.<br />This book was written in 1961, was nominated for big prizes together with such classics as Catch-22 and was forgotten after that. It is really a very modern book: the dreams and expectations of &quot;the common&quot; people have not changed much in all those years and the way in which Frank and April react and interact is only too recognizable.

You would like to shout to them: &quot;Listen to each other!&quot; &quot;Don't fight over marginal subjects!&quot; A good book that deserves to be rediscovered.	2004-07-19

And don't think that this is a boring textbook about science: Bill Bryson managed to combine pure science with tabloid-like gossipy information that makes this book very readable and also gives a nice insight into the egos of scientists and the fights that are going on in the scientific world. My absolute favorite passage (and an excellent example of the sense of humor of Bill Bryson) is:<br />&quot;In France, a chemist named Pilatre de Rozier tested the flammability of hydrogen by gulping a mouthful and blowing across an open flame, proving at a stroke that hydrogen is indeed explosively combustible and that eyebrows are not necessarily a permanent feature on one's face.&quot;<br />You'll never forget that hydrogen is combustible afterwards...

How each of them copes in his or her own way with her absence and their grief, how her family disintegrates and gets back together and how life goes on, even though it has changed for a lot of people.<br />I absolutely loved this way of looking at things: it gives the author endless opportunities to describe what is going on when a group of people loose a dear one.

But there is no such thing as a free lunch, so Carson will have to pay for the information and how far is one willing to go to find a serial killer?<br />This is quite an enjoyable read, even though the &quot;hard-boiled&quot; language is now and then quite over the top and it is questionable whether in real life a superior would be willing to oppose the detective work as much as implied in this book and whether one would be willing to transport a knife by sticking it into one's leg...

The plot twists and turns, the girls fall in love but get separated but all is well that ends well.<br />A typical Victorian novel (or at least the interpretation of a modern writer of Victorian novels). To be honest: I could not care less what is happening to the main characters Sue and Maud. Their characters remained paper-thin (as were all the other characters in the book): they moan and groan but never pull themselves together and take life into their own hands. I know that Charles Dickens had to write sturdy books because he was paid by the word, but their is no reason why modern writers should also produce endless, boring descriptions and books with too many twists and turns that do not really add something crucial to the story that is being told.	2004-04-25

One night he finds the dog of the neighbour with a garden fork sticking out of it. He decides to solve this murder in the way his great example Sherlock homes would have done, because animals have the same rights as humans. Christopher really needs to stretch his limits while &quot;detecting&quot;: he is autistic and cannot cope with simple things like the colour yellow, being touched, being in a place with lots of people or eating food of the wrong colour. But he uses his very rational mind (he wants to become a mathematician or, ideally, an astronaut) to make choices between options and to overcome some of his fears. And he ultimately discovers a truth far bigger than he could have imagined when he started his adventure.<br />This is a bitterly funny book looking at the world through the eyes of somebody who has problems understanding emotions and other human behaviour and language that are taken for granted by non-autistic people. Mark Haddon really described the essence of what it is like to be autistic. A great read (and I loved the little drawings). 	2004-04-21

It is in a sense shocking to read that the way a superpower is run is not that much different from the way an average manager runs his group of a few people. <br />I found it slightly disappointing that this biography deals exclusively with the presidency of Kennedy, not his formative years as a student, a soldier and a senator.

He falls in love with the beautiful Gentille, a Hutu woman who is build as a Tutsi, and together they see how Rwanda changes into a hell in which people are butchered by their neighbours simply because they are or appear to be Tutsi (\\"cockroaches\\" as they are called by the militant Hutu faction) or just because the military guys are drunk and feel like slaughtering somebody. They see how friends and acquaintances around them die, but refuse to believe that total madness will break out. In the end they stay too long.<br />This book is described by the author as a documentary rather than in novel, in which he wants to draw attention to the almost forgotten genocide (and also describes the spread and consequences of AIDS, another mass killer). At the time of the genocide I was in neighbouring Tanzania and even there we did not have an idea about the extent of the slaughter in Rwanda. A gruesome book that is very important, well written and it explains very clearly what happened in Rwanda in 1994.	2004-02-23

His only friend is a rather weird guy called Jesus. When Jesus shoots almost all their class members before killing himself, things start to go wrong for 15-year old Vernon. The whole town turns into a media circus and somehow people get the idea that Vernon at least helped his friend. One reporter even starts a relationship with Vernon's mother to get inside information. In the end Vernon decides to flee to Mexico, but he gets caught there and is transported to Houston, now charged with about every murder that happened in Texas over the summer. He ends up on death row where the reporter, who is now a star, crosses his path again with a reality soap in which viewers can vote who has to be killed. But in the end Vernon gets his revenge...<br />This book left me with very mixed feelings: the description of small town life in Texas is at times hilarious, the influence of television on the perception of people is revealing (and probably mainly true), but the fact that charges against Vernon are not based on any facts at all (and are actually contrary to everything that happens) are at times so irritating that I actually had to put the book away a few times. Also, the grudge that the reporter holds against Vernon remains completely incomprehensible. A strange book, but well written.	2004-02-15

Since his childhood he want to be a cosmonaut and he shares this dream with a boy from the neighbourhood, Mitiok. Together they apply for Flying School and even make it to the training for the space program. Gradually it dawns on them that the Soviet achievements in the air and in space are not as glorious as they are claimed to be: the space program has a whole new interpretation of the term \\"automation\\" which makes the people who have to carry out the \\"automated techniques\\" into instant heroes, but in a way you do not exactly want. In the end Omon visits the moon, but not in the way he had expected it to be...<br />Pelevin wraps his criticisms on the Soviet society in a story which is at the same time hilarious, sarcastic and critical and makes you think of Franz Kafka and Joseph Heller.

In essence, Elizabeth Costello is an alibi for Coetzee to put together a series of essays with his views on a number of subjects. Even though this may be interesting in itself, I did not like the fact that the book is now in between genres: one the one hand it pretends to be a novel with a fictitious main character, on the other hand it is a bundle of essays. This makes the character development of Elizabeth Costello rather weak, weaker than one may expect from a Nobel Laureate.	2004-01-16

From his early childhood onwards, the river attracts him and when he is about 14 years' old he becomes a member of the rowing club on the other side of the Amstel. Anton is an outsider: the other member are from higher social classes, his father works in the public transport branch. He is also an outsider in other aspects: he observes the others and doubts himself.<br />But then one day the eccentric Dr. Schneiderhahn chooses Anton and David for the coxless two. In Anton's view David is his very antipole: he is self-confident and outgoing. Slowly but surely the two boys become a perfect team. In the summer of 1939 they start competition rowing and they win one race after another. It becomes more and more apparent that they have a chance to participate in the 1940 Olympics in Finland. At the end of the year they promise each other to go on as a team in the next year.<br />The book is written as a oppressive retrospective of Anton who finds himself on the pier of the derelict rowing club in 1944. the reader knows what has happened between 1939 and 1944 and the typically Jewish name David strongly suggests that history has not been kind to him. A beautiful book in sensitive prose.	2004-01-10

He finds the body of a beautiful woman, strangled in her bedroom. After a short while it turns out that the woman has numerous acquaintances in the area and that there are a fair number of suspects. The investigation is not made any easier by the fact that Montalbano's superiors are not exactly supporting him, even though his own team is squarely behind him. A combination of good policework and flashes of brilliance in the end solves the crime. In the meantime Montalbano also has to sort out the mess that he is making of his private life. And that is the nice thing about this series: it is the combination of police work and private hassles, that make Montalbano into more than your average, typical policeman-from-a-novel, but rather a real character with his good and his bad sides.	2004-01-02

After opening the cave where they find a considerable number of weapons, the inspector finds a second cave where he stumbles upon a gruesome, yet old scene. Together with a number of the elderly people in the village he is eventually capable of solving the crime, but at one point this nearly costs him his life.<br />This is the second Camilleri book that I read and I should say that Inspector Montalbano is growing in his role: he start to be an acquaintance with his good and bad habits.

Mr Lupanetto has died of a massive heart attack while having sex, but the place where his body is found is suspicious: why would a cautious man like him go to the local prostitute and drug area? The inspector's investigations give a nice insight into Italian wheeling and dealing: sex schandals, rich people with an attitude, the Mafia, left versus right, corruption and bribing. In short, everything we Europeans suspect Italy to be. Italy is a lot more, but in this novel there are only hints of good food and drinks, a great culture and a lovely countryside.<br />The book is written in a very fluent style and the story has a number of twists and turns which makes it an enjoyable read. I would say 3½ stars, so let's make it 4 because this is the first book of a series and character of the inspector may still grow.	2003-12-23

When his grandfather chokes in his wine halfway through his last story, this leaves Manuel behind with an unfinished story. Manuel goes to Coimbra where he studies mathematics with professor Ribeiro, who teaches an eclectic mixture of \\"science of numbers\\", philosophy and history. Only after a while, and with the help of his love Maria and his professor, Manuel succeeds in finding a format for telling all his grandfather's stories. At the end of the book Ribeiro and Manuel go to Porto where the last story of Miguel Torres da Silva finally finds its ending.<br />This book contains rather a lot of mathematical references and jokes (the chapter numbers follow the series of Fibonacci), but I think it is also very readable for people who are not interested in mathematics as the main topic of the book is the role of stories in our lives rather than mathematics. For non native speakers: I found the German to be rather difficult.	2003-12-14

When one day one of her victims, Sarah Freeman, recognizes one of the tables in the antiques shop as her own, the family finally has to face the truth, which leads to a big domestic drama.<br />The facts on which this novel is built are of course fascinating: the trade in Jewish goods which \\"changed owner\\" illegally during the Nazi regime. Unfortunately, the story remains unclear for a long time and there are a number of story lines that have not been exploited properly: what is the role of Peter Clarke, why did Helen never before confront her grandmother with the truth and what happens in the end with the table that started it all?

He shows that the Western way of thinking has dominated the economic and technical developments over the last 2 centuries, but that it is only one of various alternative ways to establish a society. He also shows that purely secular movements like Marxism and Nazism are firmly rooted in the Christian way of thinking and looking at the world. <br />And he shows that extremely fundamental muslim movements like Al-Queda, who seem to oppose vehemently to the western, Christian way of thinking, are not as different as they seem to be. Both are based on the idea that a better world on earth is possible. The main objection of the non-Western world (and I believe by now also of a decent part of the Western world) is the messianic behaviour of the USA that wants to press its type of society as the Only Right One upon the rest of the world.<br />This is an interesting book: not easy, but smoothly written. My main concern is the misleading title: this book is much more about the United States than about Al-Queda, but probably books on Al-Queda sell better, so the title is rather misleading.	2003-10-16

As the rest of the world is worried sick by the antics of Mr. Bush, a vast proportion of the Americans don't seem to understand that he is now the biggest security risk in the world. Michael Moore, Corporate America's pain in the lower backside, describes his readers how Bush got elected, what the effects of decades of relentless conservative government are on the position of the poor, the blacks, the women and other \\"minority groups\\" (as he rightly observes, women are actually the majority group, but they never DO something with this advantage). And he tells all this in a hilarious, readable way. Sometimes the references to America's national/internal affairs are incomprehensible for a European, but the overall picture is that we Europeans are right in not trusting the US leaders and government to represent us.	2003-09-22

He is very much into religion, so much so that he decides to become a Christian, a Muslim AND a Hindu. His parents decide to move to Canada travelling by ship and taking most of their animals with them. When the ship all of a sudden sinks, Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with a zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and a Bengal tiger: a kind of Noah's Ark in the middle of the Pacific. After less than a week only Pi and the tiger remain and they settle into an unleasy relationship to survive their 227-day ordeal. The adventures are numerous, some times hilaric, sometimes tragic.<br />An extremely well written book on a subject that could easily become either a tear-jerker or totally unbelievable, but Yann Martell finds exactly the right tone to make it (relatively) light-hearted, exciting with unexpected twists and turns despite the confined space of a lifeboat. The behaviour of both the animals and Pi are natural to the extreme, a joy to read. The first part of the book, which is mainly set in India, gives some very intersting observations on animal behaviour and on religion, the second part (at sea) reads like the adventure story it is and the third part (after rescue) puts everything in an unexpected perspective. I was also amazed by the fact that a Canadian writer writes an story book that reminded me of the stories written by great Indian writers like Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth and Vikram Chandra. Truely a masterpiece.	2003-08-29

He is definitely a very real life police man and the way in which his team tackles the problems is also very believable, which can be explained by the fact that the author was a deputy sheriff in Santa Fe is a very probable explanation for this. The plot is ingenious, even though the reader knows in the end who the killer is.

In the last couple of months his fortune has taken a turn for the worse, he has lost quite a lot of money and is now heavily in debt and living in the damp cellar of his brother's house. Also, he has a powerful enemy in the merchant Parido, who is also a member of the Ma'amad, a committee that oversees the actions of the Portuguese Jews in order to prevent them from doing harm to the Jewish community. This Parido misuses his position to try and get information to ruin Miguel's trading. And then Miguel gets an offer that is too good to be true: the Dutch widow Geertruid Damhuis invites him to join in a daring scheme to trade in a new commodity, coffee. But all is not as it seems and it takes Miguel quite a while (and a lot of daring investment of money he does not own) to see through all the machinations and come out on top.<br />The description of 17th century Amsterdam and the position of Jews and merchants is very revealing, but I guess one needs to have a better insight than I have into the intrigues that can be worked out using stocks, options, futures, puts and calls to truly understand the financial wheelings and dealings that go on in the book and that in the end make Miguel's fortune. Also, the characters are rather thin, even the main character Miguel remains quite one-dimensional throughout the book which is a shame, because there are plenty of opportunities to turn this book from an average financial thriller into a more literary novel.	2003-08-05

I can imagine that some people will absolutely hate this book and the views that Houellebecq has, but I really enjoyed reading it.

There is also a &quot;you&quot; figure, another aspect of the I-figure, that is in search of the more spiritual and social/erotic aspects of life by his quest to find Soul mountain. During this quest he is accompanied (or should I say hampered) by the &quot;she&quot; figure, which is supposed to be the more feminine side of the character.<BR> <br />This book is a strange mixture of a travel diary, folk stories and philosophical explorations. The constant switching between the characters and the different aspects of the book made it difficult to get into the story. I liked the search for the old China, could hardly follow some of the philosophical insights into human relationships (is this maybe due to the huge cultural gap between the Chinese and European cultures?) and I (as a woman) absolutely hated the female part of the character. She is everything a woman is supposed to be in the eyes of certain extremely old-fashioned men: dependent, weak, whining, walking a mountain on high heels. Hello: this is the 21st century! Nowadays, there are plenty of strong, independent and interesting women around. I cannot imagine how this book won the author the Nobel Prize.	2003-07-21

During a holiday in Thailand he meets the woman of his dreams, Valerie, who works in tourism. Inspired by her, he invents a whole new form of tourism, a type of legalized sex tourism, which becomes an enormous success. Until the end of the book, when everything goes wrong and it also becomes clear why the main character is keeping such a distance from the world.<br />Michel Houellebecq uses the theme of this book to further expand his rather bleak, mechanistic and nihilistic view of society in general and in this case tourism in particular. I can imagine that some people will absolutely hate this book and the views that Houellebecq has, but I really enjoyed reading it. And it contains little pearls of observations such as: \\"If it wasn't for sex, what would life be? A pointless fight against rheumatism and tooth decay.\\" And in the end, that says it all...	2003-07-15

At least, that is what he is supposed to do, but Voldemort has returned even though the Ministry of Magic does everything to deny this. And \\"everything\\" includes the introduction of most of the students' worst nightmare: Dolores Umbridge, the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher and spy for the Minister. A witch that looks like a toad and is especially keen on trying to make Harry's life as miserable as possible. The atmosphere gets gloomier and gloomier until Harry and his friends have to take on Voldemort once again at the end of the year and Dumbledore has to tell Harry a terrible secret. <br />In this book Harry is very obviously in his puberty, with all the mood swings and agression that come with that phase. This is definitely not a typical children's book any more: as Harry is growing up, so are his adventures. The book is also gloomier and there is less to laugh. I think it could have been somewhat less voluminous without weakening the message, but definitely a very enjoyable read.	2003-07-13

She ends up in the Amazonian jungle, where she is found by two of Kurt's colleagues. In the meantime Kurt and Joe try to solve the death of a group of whales before the coast of Mexico. Soon they find out that their quest is related to that of their colleagues. Their explorations bring them from Mexico to Alaska and then to the shores of Lake Tahoe, where they stop the impending global disaster only a few days before it is due to happen.<br />Here is your recipe for the 21st century's books by Clive Cussler: replace Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino by Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala, Dirk's love for old cars by Kurt's love for duelling pistols and let the rest of the ingredients be the same: NUMA, the wisecracks, the superhuman efforts, the beautiful ladies and the megalomanic villain that wants to rule the world. Normally speaking such changes irritate me, but Kurt and Joe are so much like Dirk and Al that one hardly notices the difference. And all in all it is just a nice action thriller to read on a warm summer's day (or a long winter night).	2003-07-03

The contents are more or less the same, but Arno Karlen has a more modern style of writing, making this book more readable. Even though the last chapters give at times a somewhat alarmist view of what we are heading for, the author gives a very good overview of the history of infectious diseases and also the &quot;epidemic of epidemics&quot; as he calls it which is happening right now: from AIDS to SARS and from West Nile virus to the return with a vengeance of tuberculosis. Due to the enormous population pressure, human mobility and the ever increasing demands we make on our environment, new diseases and their rapid spread are only a breath away.<br />When one reads this book, it also becomes obvious how fast both the diseases and the medical science that has to fight them are developing: SARS was (of course) nowhere in sight in 1995 and the origin of prion diseases like mad cows' disease (which we now know is caused by the alteration of a protein that is always present in the brain) was still very uncertain at time. This book still is a very smooth read and definitely worth your time if you are interested in infectious diseases and their history.	2003-07-01

After 5 to 6 generations the grown-up population had developed enough immunity to turn the dreaded disease into a childhood affliction.<br />William McNeill reasons in this book that for full-blown plagues to occur one needs large groups of people, such as cities and he theorizes about the influence that micro-organisms and plagues may have had on such diverse historical events as the development of civilization in China, the downfall of the Roman empire, the origin of the Renaissance, the conquest of the Americas and the industrial revolution.<br />Even though definite proof is often lacking, the reasoning at most times is quite convincing even though it may be somewhat simplified here and there. The original version of this book dates from 1976 but is still very valid for our days. It is a shame that in the 1998 preface the author does not mention that diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which are in the original text described as disease that have been fought successfully, are very much on the rise again and nowadays form the part of the \\"big three\\" of most lethal infectious diseases together with HIV/AIDS.	2003-06-22

While she is sulking in her room, she sees her sister Cecilia strip of her clothes and jump into a fountain in front of the cleaning lady's son Robbie. Her ample imagination turns this scene into something it is absolutely not and when at night something awful happens she interprets it completely wrong, an interpretation that will change the lifes of herself, Cecilia and Robbie.<BR> <br />The second and third parts of the book are situated at the beginning of the war: the horrors of the evacuation of the British army at Dunkirk and the life at a London hospital. Finally in the fourth part, set in 1999, it becomes clear that this book is indeed one big atonement.<BR> <br />This is an incredibly rich book and very smoothly written. It begged me to continue reading, even though the setting of the first part (a rich English family in the thirties) is not particularly interesting to me. The second and third parts very vividly describe the horrors of war and the fourth part glues the whole book together and on the other hand also provides an unexpected twist that puts part of the story in a whole new perspective. An absolute must-read.	2003-06-14

In this hectic climate literally thousands of former Baltic and Ukranian people found their way to the UK, and among them a good many war criminals. Checking was only cursory if at all, and their was great reluctance with the British government to send even the criminals back to the USSR.<BR> <br />In the 1980's it became more and more clear that Britain provided a safe haven. It took a long and tedious process to get legislation approved that made the trial of war criminals possible. Quite a few influential people thought it was a\\"Jewish conspiracy\\". In the end only one war criminal stood trial and was convicted.<BR> <br />David Cesarani describes this whole process in much detail,maybe a little too much detail, because who is interested in an extensive list of which honourable MP said what except for the highlights? Still it was interesting to read in the end.	2003-06-08

Then after a movie his uncle tells him what happened in the past; this makes it possible for him to understand and respect his father.<br />In only very few pages Michel Quint beautifully handles big themes like the shame children feel for their parents' behaviour, love and understanding when they learn what is the cause of their actions, but also friendship, treason and selflessness.

Two of her brother die of AIDS, a disease that is widespread but hardly mentioned. Her mother tries to get her life back on the track with the advice and actions of traditional diviners, her brother Stan is caught between cultures when he has to find a way to mix his African background with the western background of the teacher in whose house he lives. After an abortion Mosa has to fight hard, first to get her place back at school and to get her family back together after years of sorrow, than to fight for her rights in an environment where teachers can do pretty much everything with their female pupils. Using a mix of social skills and cunning ideas she ends up as the glorious winner of the fight.<br />This book, written by an African woman who is a judge at the high court of Botswana, is a monument for the strength of African woman: the way in which they run society behind the scenes and in which they have to cope with sexism in order to survive. It is also a strong plea for openness about HIV/AIDS. And most important of all: there is an engrossing story to get the message across.	2003-05-15

Meanwhile her 19 year old nephew Kit is staying at her place and his obsession with Harley Davidsons gets him in contact with some of the most dangerous figures of the gangs.<br />The descriptions of the forensic work are revealing and realistic, which is no wonder when one considers that Kathy Reichs is a forensic anthropologist herself.

In about ten short stories he first very vividly describes what may have happened on board of the boats based on historical facts combined with fantasy and then the tedium and excitement of searching for and finding the ships (plus one train engine).<br />Clive Cussler has a very funny style of writing which makes this book light reading, even though content-wise it is mainly for the really historically interested.	2003-04-08

Together with his friends Oscar and Gloria, who he met during his wild years in the `70s, he runs a very successful photo agency that has made them rich. One day he takes a picture of a reactionary government member and his girl friend, a picture that earns him more than a million dollars. In first instance this picture also seems to destroy his life: he is arrested, his wife and child die when his house is blown up and when he tries to recover he is nearly beaten to death. The source of all his misfortune is located in his past and slowly but surely the explanation becomes apparent. <br />This book was awarded the prize for the best Scandinavian thriller of 1999. In some aspects, such as the psychological insights into the main character, it follows the Scandinavian tradition, in other aspects it is very un-Scandinavian: there is loads of action, including some quite violent action. A very readable book by yet another Scandinavian thriller writer that is worth reading.	2003-04-07

Jim is the son of a shopkeeper with middle class aspirations, Doyler the son of a poor, TB-ridden alcoholic father. The two fathers were once friends when they served in the army. Jim attends school, whereas Doyler has to work hard for his money. Doyler promises Jim to teach him to swim and they agree to swim to a rocky island in a year's time to raise the Irish flag once they get there. But life drifts them apart: Doyler joins the Irish socialist freedom fighters, whereas Jim goes on with his quiet school life and becomes the friend of MacMurrough, a rich homosexual dandy.<br />After a year the two boys meet again and indeed swim to the rock, but on the way back Doyler nearly drowns. When he is recovering in MacMurrough's house, Jim decides to fill in his place when the revolution against the English starts. In the end one of the three main characters does not survive.<br />The book gives a loving description of a budding friendship, but it is not very to the point: all kinds of sidelines that do not add much to the main story interfere in my opinion with the flow the story and the make the book a bit long-winded. Also, for a non-native speaker, the Irish is in the beginning rather difficult to follow, but one gets used to that.	2003-04-06

The ship is the Wilhelm Gustloff that was named after a Nazi who was killed in Davos, Switzerland in 1936. After its use as a cruise ship for the Nazi Kraft durch Freude movement, a floating hospital and a training ship, the Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed to the bottom of the sea on 30 January 1945 with on board between 6000 and 10000 (nobody knows the exact number) German refugees. On board is also the very pregnant Tulla Prokriefke, who goes into labour when the ship goes down. In the end her son Paul is born on board of a rescue boat.<br />Paul is divorced, mediocre journalist, who has, to say it mildly, a difficult relationship with his mother. One day he finds a site on the Internet that describes the ship that determined his life (his mother cannot talk about anything else). He finds that the site, with neonazi characteristics, is made by his son Konnie. And then the story goes almost inevitably to its dramatic conclusion.<br />The book is called Crabwalk because the story of the ship and the family are not told in chronological order, but by walking sideways. Still, the story goes forward, just like a crab walks. This is also because Paul tells the story of the Wilhelm Gustloff working with the information that he finds on the internetsite of his son.<br />This is a brilliantly written book, because one never gets lost between or within story lines despite the large number of considerable time leaps. Also, this book describes a little known ship tragedy (more than 5 times the numbers of death as the Titanic!) and gives an insight into the distorted minds of German neonazi's. An excellent read.	2003-03-10

During this quest he is accompanied by Alex, the son of the owner of the travel agency where he has booked his trip, Alex' grandfather and the dog Sammy Davis Junior Junior. A number of story lines are intertwined: Jonathan tells the story of Trachimbrod, Alex the history of the quest and in between we read the letters that Alex writes after Jonathan has returned to the USA.<br />Alex writes in beautifully wrong English which at times leads to hilarious sentences and the story of the village is also intertwined with anecdotes that made me cry with laughter. But there is an undertow of deep sadness which comes to a climax during the description of the Nazi destruction of the village. A great book that makes you laugh and cry, grips you from the beginning and does not let you go. A fantastic debut of a writer who is only 25 years old.	2003-03-04

He is quite a decent painter and therefore is allowed to paint fish for the doctor instead of doing tough manual labour. Billy Gould tells the story of life in the penal colony: the megalomanic commander, the scientifically obsessed doctor, the sadistic guard and in particular the enormous sufferings that the prisoners have to go through and the way in which the white people treat the indigenous population. <br />This is not a book for the fainthearted and the impression the book left on me was that the main character becomes more and more crazy as the book progresses.

The children were raised by the father in cruel circumstances and virtually without contact with the outside world. Slowly but surely it becomes apparent that horror events have taken and are still taking place in the house. The language used in the book is very special as it is an odd mixture of outdated and harsh words. The child has been raised with the language of the father plus a library full of old fashioned books of which Spinoza, the bible and the memories of the Duc de Saint-Simon were the most important ones. This unusual language makes the book very special, but the story line was in my opinion rather thin, so 3 stars.	2003-01-07

On one side were the Republicans: the legally elected government, consisting of leftish political, civil and trade union groups as diverse as the anarchists, communists, socialists and liberals backed by Russia and an international group of people willing to fight for their cause. On the other side stood the Nationalists: the army led by Generalissimo Franco and firmly backed by the Catholic church, right wing groups and the ... governments of Italy and Germany who used the war for experimenting with war tactics to be used during WW2. And here lies the weakness of the democratic countries in Europe, in particular France and Great Britain who remained not only neutral, but actively hampered the actions of the Republicans and turned a blind eye on the involvement of Germany and Italy.<br />Everyone but the staunchest right winger cannot have anything but sympathy for the initial movement of the Republicans: with only the barest means plus a lot of enthusiasm the majority of the population supports their cause and start to build a new society. But then things go desperately wrong: the communists start to build a state within the state, build a secret police force and control the republican army and do everything to block the activities of the other movements. This, plus their predilection to senseless military action pave the road to disaster.<br />This book gives a very thorough description of the actions and mechanisms, even a bit too much detail to my taste, making the book sometimes rather long-winded. But after reading the book one knows about everything that took place during the Spanish civil war.	2002-10-30

And there are more victims: people who get falsely accused, people who lose their jobs, families that reveal their secrets. When the case is finally solved Bosch is left behind with the question whether it was all worth it.<br />This is another typical Harry Bosch thriller: fine detective work, good psychological insights into the detectives and the suspects and the usual fight of the loner (Bosch) against the system (the press, his superiors).

And that is my major problem with the book: on the basis of a number of very flimsy clues they draw far-reaching conclusions which they then present as the only possible truth in the rest of the book. They then use those conclusions as the basis for even more far-fetched conclusions etc.<br />I also think that there is more to the flight of Hess than the ravings of a lunatic, but this book is a very easy way to come with a fantastic story. And the major conclusion (the person in Spandau prison was a double of the real Rudolf Hess who died in WW 2) is not supported by the evidence presented in this book.	2002-09-23

He build his own hut, marries a servant from the household of his former boss and becomes and Independent Person.<br />What follows is a chain of unfortunate events and misery: his first wife dies when giving birth, his second wife dies when he slaughters her favorite cow, most of his children die, the whole family os constantly hungry, the sheep have diarrhea or worms or both and in the meantime it does not stop raining. <br />Despite everything Bjart struggles on. And then WW 1 starts and everybody wants to buy Icelandic wool and mutton. Finally the farmers get a decent price for their sheep. And then Bjart finally pushes his luck and the books ends like it begins: with a moving to a new house. <br />An interesting theme and the book is at times very nice to read, but at other times it is enormously long-winded and the discussions between the small farmers are at times completely incomprehensible.	2002-09-15

In this new world children do not have parents, but are produced in fertilization and conditioning centers. Already during hatching the World Controller decides who will become university stuff and who will be a backward semi-moron. After birth the people are kept in a permanent state of adolescence, with the ultimate aim to hunt after pleasure and to consume goods in order to help economy. We follow 4 individuals who make different choices with regard to their future and co-operation with the system.<br />This book was written at a time when these matters were probably rather far-fetched and futuristic, but nowadays there are a lot of things which are frighteningly recognizable: for instance the cloning of people and the total brainless materialism and search for pleasure for the sake of pleasure. A book that makes one think and also realize how fast society has changed since this book was first published.	2002-08-26

He is confronted with the double murder of an elderly couple. It seems that the murder is committed by foreigners and within no time all kinds of racist groups are starting to interfere with the investigation and a Somali refugee is even executed. This latter murder is rapidly solved, but the solution of the double murder takes much more time and effort, especially since the husband had a secret.<br />A well-written police detective that shows that solving a crime is a combination of bright ideas, good collaboration and especially performing a lot of down to earth routine work. Kurt Wallander is a real person, not some kind of flimsy superhero. I did not know this detective series, but this is a certain invitation to read more of this author.	2002-08-18

But then things start to go terribly wrong: while he is sailing the captain of the ship dies and gives him a letter to forward and while he is making love to his girlfriend, his friends decide to set him up with some dope. Both events are innocent, but together they make Ned fall into the clutches of the secret service. When he becomes a free man at last, more than 10 years have gone by. And after that it is all about revenge, and quite gruesome revenge at that.<br />The book is advertised as a modern day Count of Monte Christo. There are some beautiful descriptions in the book, especially the part describing the friendship between Ned and Babe, one of the other inmates, who gives Ned back his sanity and gives him the financial means for revenge. However, I have read more interesting, thought-provoking books by Stephen Fry. An entertaining read but not much more than that and way too much revenge for my taste...	2002-07-16

The task to solve this murder rests on the shoulders of Black, the nephew of the man who coordinates the illustrations in the secret book. During the murder investigations, the reader gets a deep insight into 16th century Istabul, a city that is becoming more and more influenced by Europe and the discord this causes in the artists' society.<br />My name is Red is deeply rooted in the storytelling tradition of the East, with some wonderful digressions on subjects as varied as a gold coin, a dog and the color Red. However, the main subject of the book was only slightly interesting te me. In itself the influence that cultures may have on the developments in other cultures can be very interesting, but 500 pages on illustrations of books was a bit over the top for me.

Apparently the English version contains some really atrocious English, which was the reason for me to try the well-translated Dutch version instead.<br />Rasputin is one of the most controversial and mysterious figures in Russian history. What was his exact role in Russian politics, what was his influence on the tsar and his family and in what way did he die?<br />Apart from the usual sources, Edward Radzinsky uses in this extensive biography previously unknown material which a friend of him has bought during an auction. The author shows the influence that Rasputin had at the court and how it gradually increased, especially his influence on the wife of the tsar, until in the end he is really the one who takes all the important decisions, by turning the words of the tsarina into prophesies. We also see how he turns from a \\"wise old man\\" into a money spending,...drunk who meets his inevitable end.<br />There are quite a few characters in the books and the names are quite difficult to remember for non-Russians, so it is wise to read the book at a good pace in order to keep up with the events. All in all a very interesting book about a mysterious man and a revealing insight into a very important period of Russian history..	2002-07-02

He is also an outsider in other aspects: he observes the others and doubts himself.<br />But then one day the eccentric Dr. Schneiderhahn chooses anton and David for the coxless two. In Anton's view David is his very antipole: he is self-confident and outgoing. Slowly but surely the two boys become a perfect team.

At the end of the year they promise each other to go on as a team in the next year.<br />The book is written as a oppressive retrospective of Anton who finds himself on the pier of the derelict rowing club in 1944. the reader knows what has happened between 1939 and 1944 and the typically Jewish name David strongly suggests that history has not been kind to him.

The are raised by their grandmother, or maybe it is better to say that they grow up despite the presence of their grandmother. The children find ways to survive the war: on the one hand they can be extremely friendly and caring, for example for the girl next door, on the other hand they are 2 extremely awful boys who steal, deceive, betray and even murder whenever they think this is necessary. A beautiful, oppressive book about what war does to children, but also about the capacity of children to survive under extreme conditions.<br />The Proof describes the life of Lucas, who remains in the Hungarian village after the war. He tries to get a decent life, but every time he seems to have some luck something awful happens which brings him back to square one. At the end of the book a German appears in the village who may or may not be his brother Claus.<br />The Third Lie consists of 3 parts: one in which Claus describes the search for his brother after his return to the capital. Finally he finds an old, misanthropist poet whose name is also Klaus and who denies to be his brother. In the second part this Klaus describes why he does not want to recognize his brother.<br />It is fairly difficult to write one review of 3 books, even when these books are a logical sequel of each other. In every new book the perspective changes and the reader is left in doubt. Did this twin brother really exist? Who is Lucas and who is Claus? In the end the common denominator of the three books is the notion that real friendship does not exist, that nobody can be trusted and that every story can be told in different ways, depending on the perspective.	2002-03-09

One evening during carnaval she decides to go dancing. Here she meets a man who she really likes, but who turns out to have a criminal record. And this is when things start to go wrong... A journalist from the ZEITUNG (&quot;newspaper&quot;), a pulp magazine, claiming to be a respectable newspaper, puts hus teeth into the story and starts damaging Katharina and her family, friends and acquitances. In the end Katharina takes justice into her own hands.<br />Place and time of this pamphlet (as Böll calls this book in an afterword) are West-Germany, 1974, so a conservative society at the height of the fear for the Red Army Faction, with an unbridled influence of the pulp press, in particular the notorious BILD-Zeitung. Böll has written a convincing accusation against these type of journals and the fact that people actually believe what they say.<br />The problem with this book is that it is outdated: in the meantime the world has moved on, readers (even those of newspapers like the ZEITUNG) have become more aware of the fact that these type of newspapers tend to lie and the accusations made in those types of newspapers are nowadays even more outrageous than in 1974. I also had some problems with the style of writing: even though the book is well written (what one may expect from a Nobel laureate), the narrator actively comments on what is going on, which is sometimes irritating and does not add anything to the story.	2002-02-09

Even the decision to revert from peaceful action to armed guerilla combat becomes understandable. <br />A truly important book, which is, after a rather tough beginning, a very smooth and entertaining read.	2002-02-03

In a thin book Sebastian Haffner is capable of gving a razor sharp analysis of Hitler's successes and shortcomings. In 7 chapters he discusses his life, achievements, successes, mistakes, failures, crimes and finally treason.<br />De book has as hypothesis that Hitler's actions could only lead to the ultimate defeat, but also that he tried to aggravate this defeat to make it as heavy as possible for the German people who had deserted him. Hitler had a two-pronged approach: on the one hand he wanted to fight a war for world rule, one the other hand he wanted to destroy as many Jews (and gipsies and homosexuals and mentally ill people) as possible. This last aim was in conflict with the first one because the people and infrastructure necessary for this left his generals with unsolvable problems. Also, Haffner shows that there were 2 opportunities (1938 and 1940) when Hitler could have come out with an enormous gain in territory if he could have been content with what he had achieved. <br />The only minor drawback of the book is in my opinion that, even though Hitler was the one who took all the decisions, he needed people to execute these decisions. Haffner brushes aside this side of things a little too easy, leaving Hitler as the sole criminal. Despite this drawback, this is till a very intriguing book.	2002-01-21

Ned Kelly writes the history of his life for his daughter, whom he has never seen. He tries to explain his deeds and tell her what really happened.<br />Even though I am not familiar with the official history of the Kelly gang, I can imagine that this is indeed an alternative history. The language is that of a not very well educated but intelligent man, using the language he would have spoken. This latter means that the book is not for the faint-hearted or the puritans, even though most abusive words are written in the way you find in the title of the review. In this way Ned Kelly tries to prevent his daughter from getting exposed to swearing.<br />We come to see Ned Kelly as a straight and honest man, who after a difficult youth never really got the chance to live a normal life. The stories about the way his mother tries to survive in the harsh environment of the Australian outback and about his falling in love are truly touching. A well-written, interesting novel giving very good insight into the harsh live of the common man in 19th century Australia.	2002-01-16

They end up in the trenches in Belgium where they have to fight a long and meaningless fight for a little piece of no man's land.<br />This is a novel with a first-person narrator, which makes the book all the more impressive: Paul describes the degeneration of a generation of youngsters: the fear, the dullness, the gas, the lice, the dysentery, the hunger, the shooting of countless people and the way in which he loses his friends one by one.<br />Two times he is allowed to leave the front. The first time he visits his parents, but he cannot really get used to the civil society anymore because he misses the comradeship among the soldiers. The second time he has been shot and has to recuperate in a catholic hospital.<br />This book shows as no other book I have read so far the pointlessness and horrors of war. No wonder this book was banned by Hitler in 1933. Because of its simple description of the real events, it is the best possible accusation against war.	2002-01-05

There he pursues a career as private detective with the ultimate aim to go back to Shanghai to solve the disappearance of his parents.

Victor Klemperer is married to an &quot;Aryan&quot; wife, Eva, which means that he is semi-privileged: he has to wear the star but he is not immediately transported to Theresienstad or Auschwitz. A lot of laws against the Jews are already in place (see the first volume), but the situation nevertheless gets worth all the time: Jews are not allowed to keep pets, so their long-time companion pet has to be put down, the rations get less and less, they have to move to smaller and smaller houses constantly and Klemperer is put to work shoveling snow, packing tea, making envelopes.<br />Klemperer describes the everyday worries in everyday life and that is what makes the book so fascinating and important: nobody can say &quot;they did not know&quot;, because Klemperer knew that being sent to Theresienstad or Auschwitz was essentially a death sentence. What is also impressive to follow is that constant fear, tiredness or lack of food slowly numbs a person: when the famine begins, he complains a lot about food shortages and the bad quality of the potatoes, but when this goes on longer, the notes on the subject disappear.<br />In the beginning of February 1945 the last Jews get a notice to report for transport, but by a miracle they are saved: the same night Dresden is razed to the ground by the (in)famous bombardment, leading to a fascinating first-hand account of the experiences of a civilian in wartime. <br />Klemperer removes his star and then the 4-month trek by foot, ox-cart, milk bus and train through war-torn Germany starts: from Dresden they travel to an old servant of theirs some 10 kilometers away, then to an old friend in Falkenburg, on to Munich, where they have to travel extensively in the surroundings before they find a place to live. After the capitulation they decide to travel back to Dresden. This whole chapter gives an impressive insight into the life of ordinary Germans in the first half of 1945.<br />What is also impressive is the love for his wife Eva: he constantly worries about her, tries to protest her and does the little menial jobs in house. When they have to travel back to Dresden through after-war Germany, it is Eva, however, who leads the way and takes the decisions.<br />All in all a very important diary by a very afraid, but still courageous man.	2002-01-03

Also, there were quite a lot of public and private initiatives to prevent or counteract outbreaks, give support to the poor and needy and to regulate health and medical practice-related matters.<br />What remains is the impression that medicine in early modern Europe was less primitive than we often think (some supposedly very modern concepts such as an essential drugs list for apothecaries were already in place in the 17th century), even though there was often no cure available, and that the medical practice was on the one hand solidly anchored in a historical tradition and on the other hand developing rapidly.	2002-01-03

Even before he became Pope he was involved in the political development in Europe, particularly when serving as papal nuncio in Germany and as Cardinal responsible for foreign affairs in Vatican City. Under his guidance a concordat was made with Hitler's Germany in which the influential, Roman catholic Center Party \\"voluntarily\\" (at the command of Rome) gave up its influence. Also during the war the role of Pius XII, the moral guide of a quarter of the world population at that time, is debatable at best. In particular his \\"ear-splitting\\" silence in view of the genocide on the Jews is astounding.<br />John Cornwell has written the portrait of a lonely man who made an enormous series of misjudgements and because of the omnipotence of the Pope (a position on which he had worked himself even before his pontificate) who became more and more estranged from worldly affairs. But he also describes Pius XII as a frightened man, who, as was tradition in his time, was a racist and who could not cope with the modernizing tendencies in the church.<BR> <BR>A well-written, important book on a Pope whose canonization is apparently coming. After reading the book my impression is that this would absolutely not be deserved.	2001-12-29

It is considered to be one of the first psycho-analytical novels and a classic. It is hilarious and sad at the same time, but above all very well written. <br />Zeno Cosini is a rich man from Trieste, but his wealth is inherited. He himself is not really good in anything, except making up evasions. He is never really capable of making decisions what he wants to do with his life. The book is a description of his life which he has to write as part of his psychotherapy because he wants to quit smoke in which he does not succeed. Every day he decides to quit, but then takes a last cigarette to celebrate his decision. And that is the way his life goes: he falls in love with a daughter of a merchant, but than in the end marries her sister, he start a relationship with a poor girl but does not want to cheat his wife, he works as a volunteer in the merchant business of his brother in law, sees that things go terribly wrong but is too weak to act.<br />And still Zeno is not an annoying man: you can feel his desire to be like the other people, he knows what he is doing and at the end we see that he can act, but only when the stimuli are strong enough. A must.	2001-12-28

Count Olaf lives in a gruesome house and is the leader of a strange and rather frightening group of actors. The children have to do all kinds of tasks and in general their lives are pretty miserable. And the situation becomes even more miserable when Count Olaf has a not so pretty surprise for them in store...<br />The bad beginning is the first of a series of  books that all have in common that the events described in them are indeed very unfortunate. For me the events are a bit too unfortunate, but maybe that is because I am grown up. I like it when something good happens every now and then. Also, the superfluous explanation by the author of words that are in my opinion not too difficult and can be understood by 10-year olds, starts to be irritating after a while.<br />All in all an enjoyable read, but it cannot stand in the shadow of the Harry Potter series.	2001-12-28

Nick Hornby belongs to the last group. His obsession is Arsenal: ever since his father took him to see the Gunners to fill in those long Saturday afternoons that a divorced father has to fill in, Nick Hornby has supported The Gunners heart and soul.<br />His knowledge of football facts in general and Arsenal facts in particular is astonishing.

In 1766 Christian VII becomes king of Denmark. Christian is an anxious boy, made mad by the members of his court. Two years later Johann Friedrich Struensee becomes his personal physician. Very soon he gains the trust of the young king with his quiet behaviour. The king starts to give more and more power to Struensee, who, more or less against his own will, becomes the center of power. In a period of only a few years Struensee issues more than 600 decrees that improve the life of the ordinary Danes and make Denmark a frontrunner of the Enlightenment movement. However, Struensee does not realize how much resistance his actions cause in the surroundings of the king. In 1772 he is arrested and tried on the basis of his relationship with the queen.<br />We follow the events through the eyes of a number of people: Christians private teacher  Reverdil, the young queen Caroline Mathilde, Struensees rival and successor Guldberg and Struensee himself.<br />Per Olov Enquist has succeeded in writing a monumental literary novel: the actors are real, full of doubt, passion and deceit. The description of the way in which the mind of the young Christian is broken is most impressive. A king has absolute power, but is not supposed to actually exercise it, so the whole court conspires to break his mind. What remains in the end of an intelligent, normal boy is a mental wreck who lives in a fantasy world.	2001-12-01

All leads point to Harry Bosch, the detective that is the fixed main character in Michael Connelly's books. Did he or did he not step over the line that separates doing justice from committing crimes? Harry Bosch is in the meantime busy as a member and star witness of the prosecution team that tries to nail a Hollywood movie maker for the killing of at least one girl.<br />We follow both Terry McCaleb and Harry Bosch in their quest for justice. The book is very smoothly written with a lot of action even though it is not always of the &quot;shoot to kill&quot; variety. The solution of the case was obvious after the first half of the book. The way in which it is described is, however, very entertaining making this book maybe not the best of Connelly's work but definitely worth the reading.	2001-11-25

When his girlfriend Laura leaves him for the neighbour upstairs he looks back on his life, and especially on (the endings of) his relationships: what did he want from the relationships, when and why did things go wrong, how did or didn't he react. When Laura and Rob get back together, we follow the re-start of their relationship.<br />The book is terribly funny, but also terribly recognizable. I bet most people of Rob's age will recognize at least part of Rob's behaviour as being very similar to how they react in such situations. Thus the book also works as a mirror that leads the readers to reflect on their own way to cope with one of the most important aspects of life: the way in which they interact with other people.	2001-10-24

They have to work in the rice and cornfields and in a small coal mine. Luo is found to be an extremely good narrator so the 2 of them are send to movies in a nearby &quot;city&quot;. Afterwards they can then narrate the story for the villagers. <br />From another boy they get a book from Balzac, which opens their eyes for prose that is radically different from the revolutionary texts with which they were raised. When the boy goes back to his parents, they steal his suitcase full of Western books.<br />In the meantime Luo has fallen in love with the daughter of the tailor, the Chinese seamstress. He sees it as his task to raise her cultural awareness by reading for her parts of the Western books. When Luo all of a sudden has return to his parents for 1 month, he asks his friend to look after the Chinese seamstress. <br />The end of the story I cannot reveal, but I think it is quite unsatisfactory as is the whole book: the characters are paper-thin, the theme remains vague and there is not a lot of humor in the book, even though that is claimed.

So Artemis has decided on a criminal plan to get the Fowl family back in business: he is going to kidnap an elf and get a ransom of 1 ton of pure elf gold in return.<br />His bad luck is that he happens to kidnap not just any elf, but Captain Holly Short, the first female officer of the elFBI. What follows is a clash between the elves, who are not the docile little creatures that are depicted in the fairy tales, and their helpers (including a cynical centaur, a mud-eating kleptomaniac dwarf and an all-destroying troll) and Artemis and his helpers, Butler and his sister Juliet.<br />The story is very entertaining: it has a lot of pace, the twists and turns are unexpected and the various elves and their helpers are sometimes hilarious (I especially loved the mud-eating dwarf and the way he disposed of the mud). However, the story is not in the same league as Harry Potter, mainly due to the fact that Artemis is an awful little brad: far too wise for his age and with an answer to everything.

No wonder that this would make a human crazy. In the end he destroys the roots of evil by killing the face of apartheid.<br />In between all this we can read the writers own experiences during a number of visits (1989-1998) to South Africa, the country where he lived from age 9 to 21.

The government panics and decides to lock the people up in a big, abandoned building. We follow the small group of people who arrive first and read how their situation deteriorates rapidly: the place gets incredibly filthy, there is not enough food and soon a gang is formed that terrorizes the other blinds, including the people in our group. What nobody knows is that one of the group members has not fallen blind and she tries to help the other group members without telling them that she can still see. After a terrible fire the group can escape and tries to make a living in the free world again, where the whole public life has turned into a catastrophe. The horrors are described very vividly and sometimes make you positively sick. But what Saramago shows us is not only the black, egoistic and violent side of people that shows up the moment you remove the thin layer of cultural varnish. He also describes how in very awful situations some people rise above themselves and are capable of altruism and that it is impossible to say who react in what way once something truly awful happens. A book that definitely makes one think about your life and what would happen if something similar would happen to oneself.	2001-08-24

Are these crimes related? Who did it? It is up to don Ciccio to solve this.<br />This looks like the start of a detective, but the book is not a detective. The investigations by the inspector and his colleagues are used by the author to give (beautiful) descriptions of anyone and anything the investigators meet on their way, be it a fellow inhabitant of the Via Merulana or a bunch of chicken running in front of a train. The book also contains a lot of non too flattering references to Mussolini, for whom Gadda has created a whole bunch of inventive nicknames.<br />My biggest problem was that after about half the book all descriptions start to be more of the same: they are beautiful, clear, inventive and therefore suprising, but there is not really a storyline.<br />So all in all: beautiful descriptions, less interesting as a book.	2001-08-19

He did not give much attention to this fact until it was forced upon him when Hitler came into power.<br />His diaries describe the slow but sure downgrading of his life: first he is not allowed to continue his work at the university, then he cannot buy certain goods anymore such as tobacco, then he is not allowed to keep pets and so it goes on and on... And every time he and his German wife (the reason he is not transported) adapt and try to count their fewer and fewer remaining blessings.<br />The book is very impressive, especially because it shows what an impact relatively small decisions made by the Nazi government (not being allowed to keep pets is small compared to the Endlosung) had on everyday life and how much energy the Nazi's spent on making life as unbearable as possible for the few remaining Jews. Also impressive and heart-warming are the reactions from the &quot;common man&quot;: even though people were terrified of the government they greeted Klemperer and gave him cigarettes.<br />This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the effects that governments can have on the life of their citizens.	2001-08-17

And what an ugly story it is. After an upbringing in a not very supportive family and an unsuccessful education, she meets and marries Charlo when she is still really a child. In the beginning Charlo is very charming, but you feel danger lurking in the background all the time. And then the beatings start, which rise in frequency and severity, but every time she finds a reason to forgive the man she still loves and (in her opinion) depends on. Until she sees him looking at their oldest daughter with this special, violent look...<br />It is book that made me want to cry for Paula when you could almost feel her bones breaking, cry out to Paula to DO something. When she finally takes her life into her own hands, a great feeling a relief washed over me. So a big compliment for Roddy Doyle.	2001-08-12

The problem is that this man is not as unacceptable to other nations as Hitler was, thus changing history in a way which the two had not quite imagined...

A must read for everybody who is even vaguely interested in modern biology, this books describes the key event that lead to today's age of biotechnology: the discovery of the double helix by Watson and Crick in 1951-1953 through the eyes of one of the discoverers, James Watson. At the time of the discovery James Watson was a young, brilliant student in the laboratory of Francis Crick in Cambridge. The two formed an unlikely pair: the smooth, young, ambitious American and his English colleague, every inch the typical English university scholar. The scientific path leading to the conception of the Double Helix (the structure of the DNA) is described and it is not a path with nice views only. The descriptions of Francis Crick and Roselind Franklin are not very flattering to say the least.<br />The book is a very smooth read, especially for a &quot;science&quot; book, maybe also because James Watson dared to vent his personal opinions on his colleagues. This may not be very scientific, but it makes the book interesting to read. And of course the highlight in not every scientist's life is there: that one time only moment when you have a deep insight and all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place and what is left afterwards is this feeling of utter joy and satisfaction. And in the case of James Watson of course also the Nobel prize.	2001-08-10

What these six stories have to do with each other? Everything according to the author, but it takes a lot of pages. <br />The book is 579 pages and only after more than 400 pages do all these stories start to converge. This makes the book a real tour the force and some of the story lines are and remain sketchy. The book is well written which makes you read on, but the switching between all the stories is quite tiring and unsatisfying. So all in all a nice book which could have been a very good book if the author would have focussed a little bit more.	2001-08-09

This book was so controversial in Portugal, that Saramago had to leave his home country.<br />The book describes the life of Jesus Christ, starting with the angel coming to Maria. Josef and Maria are living in a small hovel and even though Josef is a decent carpenter, it is very hard for him to make enough money for his family. So after Maria has given birth to their son in a small cave just outside Bethlehem, he moves to Jerusalem to help with the building of the Temple. He overhears 2 soldiers talking about the order to kill all small children and without hesitation he runs all the way back to Bethlehem. He saves his little family but is later overcome with remorse that he did not warn the other parents.<br />After Josef has been killed by the Roman soldiers, who accidentally take him for a Jewish freedom fighter, Jesus -at that time an angry young man in his puberty- stays a little longer with his mother but then decides to go his own way. Essentially all the events which are mentioned in the bible are also told in this book, but in a different and historically problably more authentic way. The love story between Jesus and Maria Magdalen, a very strong, independent woman in the book, is truely superb.<br />The highlight of the book is when Jesus, God and the Devil stay on a boat in the middle of the Sea of Galilee. God tells them what he has in store for mankind in the future. He describes the Inquisition, the martyrs, the killing in his name. The Devil is overcome by grief and offers God a kind of truce in order to save these peoples lifes, but God refuses the offer. This makes God the villain of the story.<br />This book is a must read for people who are not orthodox Christians.	2001-08-06

It is essentially a book about a friendship that crossed borders, cultures and generations. The author is an American not-really-good-for-anything poet in his forties, who has had a lot of different jobs, never really settling anywhere because his major love is writing poetry. His neighbour is an ascetic, noodle-eating monk, Tsung Tsai in his seventies who happens to be the only surviving monk of a monastery in Inner Mongolia where had to flee from in the fifties during Mao's prosecution of Buddhism.<br />The monk's main wish is to go back to his home country, so after a lot of preparations they set out with a huge Buddha statue in their wake to bring this statue to its rightful place in Northern China. Where George worries all the time, Tsung Tsai puts his trust on the Buddha, and somehow thing always end up right. The highlight of the book is the gruelling climb of Crow Mountain, the place where Tsung Tsai's master had his retreat. Purely on inner strength Tsung Tsai makes it, but has to be carried off the mountain by one of the two guides.<br />The book is a combination of history, poetry, philosophy, cultural differences, but above all friendship. The descriptions are sometimes hilarious, which makes the book very light even though the subject is sometimes quite heavy.	2001-08-05

What remains is a very bulky,  entertaining though not earth shattering book. After his \\"histories\\" of Salisbury, London and Russia he has now chosen the Forest, an extensive woodland area south of Salisbury. The book is well written and reads fast despite its 800+ pages.<br />The book starts in 1099, when King Rufus is killed during a hunt in his royal Forest. Edward Rutherfurd gives an alternative description of this killing. In this first chapter the author is quite keen on venting facts: a bit boring and interruptive to the story. Luckily this is less so in the remaining 6 stories which describe such events as the life in a medieval monastery, the Spanish Armada, a witch process, the time of the Puritans, the business of the smugglers which have always been active on the southern shores of England, and finally the way in which the Forest became a national protected area. I look forward to reading his next novel on Dublin...	2001-08-05

After the first one the citizens blame outsiders, after the second one they start to suspect people in their own town, after the third, the nightmare starts. First the blame is put on someone who is different: Chihani, the socialist, Mediterranean teacher of the local high school and -worst of all- does not even drive an American car. But after he is killed by his fellow townspeople the nightmare goes on. In the end it is found that the murders (because that is what they turn out to be) have been committed by a perfectly respectable citizen and the whole town hopes that live will go back to normal.<br />And this is what fascinated me in the book and what made me think: this town will never go back to normal. There have been too many false accusations between people who thought they were friends, relations in this town will be disturbed for at least a generation. A book that truly makes one think what would happen if this nightmare took place in your own neighbourhood.	2001-08-05

And what is amazing is that it happened without people realizing that a way of life got lost forever: it was truely a silent revolution.<br />In this book Geert Mak succeeds fully in describing the process of this revolution, the small changes creeping into the apparently static society of a small village in rural Frisia by telling the simple life stories of farmers, grocers, even the local music club. Geert Mak is a renowned Dutch journalist and it shows in his way of writing: the style is smooth and fascinating with an avid eye for detail as well as the human angle.	2001-08-02

He walked gruelling distances (up to 40 kilometers a day with a heavy backpack) and slept in real Japanese ryokans, eating Japanese food, soaking in Japanese baths and drinking Japanese drinks. The ultimate Japan experience.<br />I read this book while travelling through Japan and it described exactly what I was experiencing. I did not speak a word of Japanese (this in stark contrast to the author). People were very friendly and helpful, but you always felt the distance they were keeping because to Japanese foreigners are really strange. Alan Booth has at times hilarious accounts in the book of ryokan-owners who do not want to give him a room because &quot;he does not speak Japanese&quot; (the conversation is in Japanese), &quot;a foreigner cannot sleep on a futon&quot; (he has one at home), &quot; a foreigner will not like Japanese food&quot; (he has been living and eating in Japan for a long time) and 1001 other fake reasons. On the other hand he meets lots of very friendely people who overcome their xenophobia and help him along.<br />The book mainly focusses on the first part of his hike. At the end of the book the account of the trip becomes too intermittent for my taste: I wanted to learn more about the southern part of the country.<br />If you decide to travel to Japan, read this book, it will make you understand better what is happening to you. And if you do not travel to Japan, read it anyway because it a wonderful account of a hiking-trip through a very special country.	2001-08-02

The mother obediently follows her husband and so do the 4 girls, ranging in age from small child to teenager. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the females, which makes the book very diverse and enjoyable, because the same incident can be seen from different angles.<br />We read about the time the family spent in Congo, but also what becomes of the females of the family in later years. The tone is very well set: the description of the stifling heat in Congo and the stifling power of the father almost makes you feel it.<br />All goes well that ends well, but things are not going well from the beginning, mainly because the father refuses to accept that different cultures do things differently for very good reasons. So the seeds drown in the garden, the people refuse to come to the church and even the birthday cake is not what it is supposed to be. The father's power is slowly but surely eroded by the events that take place and leave their mark on the rest of his family.<br />The six characters are all completely different. The unbending father tries to convince the villagers that Jesus is love, pronouncing it in such a way that it comes out as &quot;Jesus is poisonwood&quot;, a local plant that can give you an immensely unpleasant rash. The eldest daughter is stupid and superficial (leading to hilarious misuse of difficult words), and even though she stays in Africa for the rest of her live, she always remains an outsider. The tomboy middle girl for a while really tries to please her father until she falls thoroughly in love with the continent and especially with one of its inhabitants. Through her accounts we are able to follow the sad history of Congo. Her bright but handicapped twin sister returns to the USA, but somehow Africa has made a lasting impression, which influences the choiceof her career.

The book is situated in 18th century France and describes the life of a murderer. The fascinating thing is that this Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is not an ordinary murderer (if they are ever ordinary) but that he murders to create the perfect perfume in order to overcome his handicap: he does not have a scent of his own, and to satisfy his overpowering sense of smell. What I found enormously fascinating is that the author is capable of taking a person with whom you cannot identify and then describe his desires in such a way that you actually come to understand (which is not the same as agree with) his actions.	2001-07-31

Moreover, all those parasites have completely outlandish names which you could mostly not remember, even if your life depended on it. <br />Apart from the fact that parasites are really important pathogens in developing countries, they are also coming more and more to the western world as well, with increased travel and worldwide business, so a good reason to know more about them.<br />The stories in the books from Mr. Desowitz show that parasites are not only an interesting study objects, but that you can write very funny stories about them as well. This is probably one of the best books to get people interested in parasites, namely wrting stories which you can remember (and tell people on birthday parties) even when you are not an accomplished parasitologist.	2001-07-30

Most of Michael White's book is indeed very readable. What disturbed me a little is that there are quite some extrapolations in the book: thin facts (which is probably logical if you have to go back 500 years in time), followed by enormous conclusions, which then may or may not be true. I also had the feeling that sometimes there were more clues available, butthat for readability's sake the author had decided to leave them out, only giving a rather vague indication that there was more information available. I found this rather distressing, but that may be the scientist in me who wants to know all the facts. Apart from this it is a very fluently written book which gives you a nice idea of the live of a genius who does not wish to conform to society.	2001-07-30
