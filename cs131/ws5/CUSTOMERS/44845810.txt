The main focus is or course on the 70 years of Franz Joseph's reign. The book deals with the military as well as the political/ethnic problems which the army faced during these years. And also the technological problems the army faced trying to stay current with other great powers while at the same time clinging steadfastly to traditions and practices which were becoming not only obsolescent but a detriment to the sound functioning of the army. All in all a very good book. I highly recommend it.	2005-05-24

For anyone who wants to understand this administration's foreign policy - and just how it has been hi-jacked - this is the book! This is a concise recording of ideology over reality. The facts be damned. The ideological agenda is what is important - not the reality of the facts. \\"Damn the torpedoes - Full speed ahead.\\" (And after all, those of us in Washington and Academia who espouse this theory aren't the ones who must do the bleeding and dying. We have others to do that for us.) <br /> <br />I think a few excerpts from the book explain our current foreign policy - and the reasons for the war in Iraq. A basic tenet of the Neo-Con movement is American Supremacy - military and other. Hence there is no need to be bothered with other nations or their interests. This is the famous \\"Unipolar Moment\\" which is now an \\"Era.\\" This is the reason we need \\"no entangling alliances.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Having, as we have shown, more or less abandoned international cooperation as a means of achieving American objectives, having an almost religious belief in military power, and living by a historically anomalous selfish interpretation of American leadership, Neo-conservatives prefer to go it alone.\\"  (pg 272) <br /> <br />On page 281 is a quote from a historical figure which is very apropos -  <br /> <br />\\"As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil then the good becomes indistinguishable from the evil they set out to destroy\\" - John Locke. (pg 281) <br /> <br />We have very much come to this with the new permissiveness for the \\"invasion of privacy\\" under the PATRIOT and other laws put forward by this administration.  <br /> <br />And most clear and concise of all is this Clausewitzian statement found on pg. 282, \\"Terrorism neither occurs in a vacuum nor is it generally a product of outside agitation or ideologies. Rather terror can be seen to follow Clausewitz's dictum as politics by other means. Placed in a political context, there can be no military conclusion to a counterterrorist campaign.\\" (pg 282)  Witness Algeria, witness Viet Nam, witness Northern Ireland, witness Basque Spain, and witness Iraq to come.  <br /> <br />Neo-Conservatism is a bankrupt policy of military aggression and suppression. It can be explained to Iraqi's as \\"This is what is best for you.\\" Is it no surprise that they reject it - and that our \\"allies\\" such as France, Germany, Korea and many others reject it also.  <br /> <br />The book is a real eye opener. You should not miss it if America's future is something important to you. <br />	2004-09-15

It is an interesting, if ultimately unconvincing book. Interesting theory, lots of conjecture, and lots of \\"What if...\\" in every chapter.  <br />To me it seems that in many places sweeping statements are made, but never supported. Take for instance the statement on page 110 \\"Changes in ocean chemistry caused by increased tectonic activity beginning a billion years ago facilitated the evolution of skeletons.\\"  But the section does not, to me, provide adequate support or explanation for this supposition. <br />Also take for example the Drake Equations which - while properly explained - is misstated in the details. <br />The equation is usually written:  N = R* x fp x ne x fl x fi x fc x L  where:<br />N = The number of civilizations in The Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable. <BR>R* =The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life. <BR>fp = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems. <BR>Ne = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life. <BR>fl = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears. <BR>fi = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges <BR>fc = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space. <BR>L = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.<BR>(Source: Seti Institute, [...])<br />However, as given in the text of \\"Rare Earth\\" the formula is: <br />N* x fs x fp x ne x fi x fc x fl = N<br />This does not appear to be a big difference, however, the terms fi, fl, and fc are each mis-defined in the book.  fi is definedas planets where life does arise, not intelligent life; fc as planets on which intelligent life emerges, not civilizations that develop a technology; and fl as percentage of lifetime of a planet that civilizations release detectable signals into space, not planets with life.  This may seem nothing more then nit picking over details, but to me this is symptomatic of the entire work. If you can't even get a few simple 40 plus year old definitions right how accurate is the rest of the work? The belief that earth is the rarest of planets and then the selection of information to support that idea appears to be the main thrust here. <br />Good science uses data to take you to a logical, fact supported conclusion, you get the reverse when to select facts to support a preconceived conclusion. <br />Overall an unsatisfactory book.	2004-01-16

Talking heads throw it around every Sunday morning. So one might expect a book entitled After Hegemony to be discussion on American foreign policy \\"after hegemony.\\" In this case - Wrong!  This is a nearly 20 year old book with a title that is currently a trendy topic. And it deals with political economy and \\"regime\\" formation, such as international monetary regime, international trade regime, and international oil regime, how these regimes were founded during the time period the author considers the time of US economic (and military) hegemony (the 1950's and 60's) and how they evolved during the years after US hegemony had passed according to the author.<br />For students and academics who are interested in the political and economic theory of how organizations are created and evolve, how \\"rational actors\\" (governments) behave on the macro scale, how preponderance of power allows a nation to create regimes (that is rules sets) that favor its policies, how these regimes become self-perpetuating, this is the book. It is an academic analysis of the subjects.<br />If you are looking for something relating to the oft discussed current \\"American Hegemony\\" and its likely impact on US and world relations, this is not the book. Look on.	2003-07-30
