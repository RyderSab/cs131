There's plenty of treasure inside this book that will enrich your lives for years to come. What makes this book a-must is that the interviewer of Dalai Lama, related his own experiences in the book from what he learned during the interviews with Dalai Lama. <br /> <br />In one word everyone should read this book without any prejudice. <br /> <br />Enjoy	2005-02-02

Even though he was born to a 23 years old widowed mother (since his father lost his life in a traffic accident) The Bill Clinton, was a very lucky fellow because as he said it himself he had three parents. <br />His very hard-working Mother, and his Grandma and Grandpa.  <br />The very first chapters are quite moving. He talks about how he always spent his time with his Grandmother and Grandfather. He enjoyed when his Grandmother read him Dick and Jane novels and World Encyclopedias; he liked spending as much time as possible with his Grandfather. By the time he was ready for school, The Bill Clinton was already an old man. Such was his destiny. <br /> <br />The book cost me $21 and from the first page until the very last I thought that I have The Bill Clinton as a guest of honor in my house and that I was paying him 2 cents a page (a minute and a half) to tell me everything about HIS LIFE. My reading philosophy <br />worked so nicely that the 957 pages book seemed as 957 lines. <br /> <br />From a man like The Bill Clinton, everyone will definitely learn something, especially from the first few chapters where there's heaps of morale stories. <br /> <br />ENJOY <br />	2004-08-21

Everything happens for a reason. <br /> <br />I have a very rich home library and amongst them I've only had one book by Bill Bryson (the funny travel-writer). So many times when I visited local bookshops I wanted to buy all his books and start reading them one by one but...that never happened! What actually happened was the only book I had by him ended up in my hands and I've started reading it. <br /> <br />That book was \\"Notes from a big country\\" <br /> <br />Bill Bryson, \\"an American\\" by nationality, but so anti-American by heart wrote this book about U.S.A. even though all he talks about is New Hampshire! In this book, U.S.A. is not a dream to those who would like to experience their dream, but a nightmare they've never imagined. If the people (who know nothing about U.S.A. daily life and traditions) read this book and believe this \\"funny\\" Bill Bryson they'll probably think U.S. is the worst place to live and that Americans are stupid. <br /> <br />This book would be a perfect gift to all illegal immigrants when they get deported so they could read something bad about America. <br /> <br />This book would be and probably is a bestseller in Middle East and anywhere where civilization and freedom is despised. <br /> <br />After all, this book is a nothing because everyone who is wise enough knows that \\"A tree who curses his own roots - is not a tree worth looking\\" and that is excatly who this Bill Bryson is in this book! I wish I had the e-mail of mr.\\"Funny\\" guy and remind him that \\"The best copy is the original\\" (so even though you lived in England for twenty years you'll never become an Englishman...at least not a nice one :). <br /> <br />P.S. \\"Do not take my review seriously!!!\\" \\"I just happen to be another as-funny-as-Bill-Bryson in my review as he was in his book \\"Notes from a big country\\" about America!	2004-08-10

Because he is the best example of what SUCCESS or I shall better say, what LIFE is all about! <br />Obstacles to him were not holes that people get stuck in them all of their lives. To him obstacles were nothing more then Challenges. He was discriminated and intimidated because he was black but that didn't make any difference on him. To him that meant Challenge, again. <br /> <br />His autobiography is over 600 pages. The three long, yet very fast days, that it took me to finish Colin's book - were definitely my best reading days ever so far. Colin writes so honestly and so beautifully that he made me feel that I know him and his lovely family personally.  <br />No Stephen Covey or Anthony Robbins or any self development writers can raise your self-esteem better then Colin Powell - my hero. <br />Remember his over 600 pages book is a re-readable book. There's heaps to be learned not only about success, him and his family but about other people too such as President Regan, Bush and so many other prominent figures. <br /> <br /> <br />ENJOY	2004-08-09

At one moment this Ken Booth protects Milosevic from the genocides he had committed to Bosnians,Croatians and Kosovar Albanians then at the next moment he describes vividly all the sufferings created by Milosevic which added together make nothing but Genocide. <br />  <br /> If you're trying to find a nice and accurate book about Kosovo chose something like &quot;Waging modern war&quot; by Wesley Clark because this one is definitely not about Kosovo!!! Most of the time I felt like the writer only used the Kosovo title when he published this book because then when it was published Kosovo was a hot topic! He goes as far as what Australians did to Aborigins and British to Maoris. <br />  <br /> Ken Booth you're smart - you've made it very obvious!!! But one more thing &quot;Easier said then experienced&quot; and if I am not wrong you are Welsh not a Kosovar to know so well about Kosova but thanks for your time. I hope you got paid well for that.	2004-08-05

To read about a child who sees her mother getting killed by her uncle and grandfather then later being adopted by &quot;Cruel&quot; religious parents - depressed me a great deal. But as I kept reading the book I was suspecting the writer's honesty! Especially when in page 101 she refers to the mother of her adopted mother as &quot;How could anyone love that withered, malevolent old hag?&quot;. Automatically, once I've read that line I re-visited the holly Amazon.com and read a couple of reviews and in there I've found a lot of people who contradicted everything this pathological liar said in her &quot;Ten thousand sorrows&quot; book, and who calls herself a victim. <br />  <br /> I knew about the term &quot;Too good to be true&quot; but only after I've lost about two hours of my life in this &quot;book&quot; I got to know that there must be a term &quot;Too horrible to be true&quot; too. <br />  <br /> Nice one &quot;Doubleday&quot;!

They both kill them and their lovers but later on, one of the brothers, King Shahryar can't stand the loneliness in the dark so he comes to a decision to marry a new wife fetched by his Counsellor, every night then kill her next day after because he believes that \\"All women are fickles\\" and that \\"None of them love their husbands for more then one day\\"...so he marries a new wife each night until the streets began to get emptied.

One day as he was traveling he saw a starved to death dog in the street. The merchant takes that dog with him and drops him at the first restaurant where he makes an arrangement with the owner to feed the starved dog with any food he'd like then when he'd come back from the business trip he'd pay him back for everything the dog was feeded.<BR>After a week the merchant came back to the restaurant to pay for the food the dog ate during all this time and as soon he went out of his car the very same dog attacked the merchant and bit him until the merchants screams were heard by the restaurant owner. When he finally came to his rescue, the merchant in pain asked him not to help because he fully deserved all this for rescuing the dog he never knew before.<br />Same story with this Paul Burrel. He had the priviledge and honour to be inside the roofs with the most revered people in England and world - yet he was ungrateful and missused their warm hospitality by having an affair with an already married woman with children. And now he writes a 'book' and he even signs them forgetting totally how would he feel if what he did was done to him personally.<BR>After all the true facts, whoever buys and reads this book - had spent its money and wasted their money on NOTHING.<br />The honourable Queen Elizabeth the second, and prince Charles should actually have a copy or two of this book too - in order to remember how careful they have to be on their choices when they give someone the honour to live and work under the same roof with them.	2004-06-21

Warren Zimmerman - a former Yugoslavian U.S. Ambasador writes frankly and in details on all his encounters with the Yugoslavian beasts that lived in Serbia's parliament. <BR>When it comes to Kosovars long sufferings from serbs, he talks as if he were an Albanian but when it comes to Kosova's history he talks as if he were a Milosevic! He failed to mention Edith Durham's journals on Balkans in which she clearly explains that it was the Slavs who settled where Albanians always were at around 600 AD - but he doesn't failed to mention Rebecca West's 1184 pages book - more than half of them full of lies.<br />This book was published in 1996 and the serbs which Zimmerman blamed and praised in his book - revealed their true selves only after the 1999 Kosova War - so I am pretty sure that Warren Zimmerman now has an even harsher view on serbs and more sympathetic views when it comes to Kosova's independence which is inevitable.

According to the writer of this title provoking book - before we were even born God has planned for us to hold and read &quot;The Purpose driven life&quot; later on the writer carries on and says things about GOD as if he has interviewed God or as if God has confessed to him. It is maybe not that nice to say but there are so many contradictions and so many inaccuracies. If God is LOVE which HE is and if GOD doesn't want to hurt us (as the writer himself claims) and at last if GOD knew before we were even born that we're gonna be reading Rick Warren's book how come GOD who doesn't want to hurt us, how come the LOVE allows tragedies such as 9/11 and wars like the one in my country Kosova, where civilians not soldiers are targets??<BR>I am all lost - but don't tell me I am a wanderer nor that I don't have a purpose in my life because if I didn't I would've quited my life ages ago after all the things I went through in my most wonderful world which has so many idiots and killers in it. What I am trying to say is that GOD is LOVE and creates people with love but doesn't guide anyone who is guided by evil mind thoughts and actions basically An inventor of a thing creates a thing but how that thing works is not 100% up to the<BR>inventor even though he may have the idea what a thing should do and shouldn't. Same with the GOD he creates us first as babies and what we become it's all up to us and of course The Almighty<BR>is always our fair and square and the sweetest Parent who rewards and punishes us according to what we have done.<br />I am so sorry if my opinions offended any of Rick Warren's loyal readers but I hope whoever that is understands that it wasn't my intention to do so or to put down Rick Warrens valuable time he spent on this book. After all it was great fun reading it and I have definitely learned something from it and what I have learned is &quot;To read a few pages before I purchase a book&quot;	2004-02-12

At least for Paul it isn't.<BR>I'll explain myself. Well, The Pillars of Hercules is a book Paul wrote on his travels all over the Mediterranean. For people who didn't read other travel books by this wonderful writer let me tell you that he writes what he sees not about what he liked before he even went to one of his dream places. This particular book is amazing and I am only halfway through it and I learned heaps, and I could almost say that I've seen a lot too because the writing is so wonderful, so vivid. It just makes me feel that I am on vacation.<BR>Anyways, if you decide to &quot;Waste some of your time&quot; on a book chose this one - I swear you wont be dissapointed at all. Apart from beautifully described places Paul visited you'll get to know about so many nations histories,culture,customs,stupidities etc.<br />Highly Recommended. Go PAUL you're even better than Bill Bryson. Hope you'll write about Kosova too someday. You would absolutely like it there. Warm Hospitality and an Enormous Love is what you'll find there especially if you're an American.	2004-02-03

Her doctor recommended that she changes the place where she lives and she did. She sailed to Balkans and it was then when her lifelong involvement with the people of Balkans began.<br />&quot;As I knew there was no case on record of a stranger being &quot;held&quot;<BR>in North Albania, and moreover, The Albanian is an old friend of mine&quot; - she writes and there she was in Albania even though they were under occupation by Turks at the time.<br />Even though it is more like a armchair travel book, Edith gave us a lot of historical facts about Albanians. She writes a lot about Illyrians and Skenderbeg. She talks about times when Slavs with an enormous number came to Balkans for the first time. <BR>But what makes this book so pleasant is when she writes about her time spent with various Albanian tribes. There are so many &quot;tales&quot; such as those with Witches. There is a &quot;tale&quot; about an Albanian woman who killed her husband who sold her brother's life to the turks for a bag of gold.<BR>There is a lot of everything and this book is just wonderful by all means. Even though I am an Albanian there were lots of things I learned that I didn't know before.<br />So if you really need to learn more about Albanians, their traditions and their history - one must chose Edith Durham's book<BR>&quot;High Albania&quot;<br />Highly Recommended	2003-11-08

I've had it in my bookshelf since then, and I read just a few pages a day. I wanted it to be a long-lasting book yet I've read it so fast. Madame Secretary, sacrificed a lot of her energy to bring freedom and peace not just in Kosova my country, but wherever she possibly could. Madame Secretary's actions will be appreciated forever because she always worked for what was right and when one works for what's right there's no way things can go wrong even if they may seem so.<BR>Her book is as delightful as her personality.<BR>It is well written,informative and not one page is boring. She starts her book with her family and she talks about her father who was a prominent czechoslovak diplomat - a fighter of freedom who despised the communism. If it wasn't for his hatred towards communists we would never have the pleasure of having Madeleine Albright as a Madame Secretary because she and her family would never be forced to leave their homeland Czechoslovakia.<BR>Madeleine, was only eleven years old when she came to U.S.A. but from the very beginning she was as patriotic as half if not all U.S. immigrants put together. She became a proud American and she worked for a better U.S.A. in any ways she could. She's a great lesson to all immigrants including the future ones, that a country that gives you freedom and treats you equally should be given something back - at least some appreciation.<br />Time is the best friend of truth and while reading this book I discovered that Clinton's administration was heaps better than<BR>Bush's one! It's sad that some people can not understand that just yet especially when it is so obvious. Since the day Bush,<BR>has been appointed a U.S. President things have gone so badly in so many ways, economically, and worst of all, Americans are not as safe in their peacekeeping missions as they were when Clinton <BR>was a president. David Letterman, didn't have that much laughing material with any other president as he has with George W. Bush, and what can one expect from a show-off yet clumsy person like he is. I truly hope general Wesley Clark will be his successor. He brought peace to Kosova without any casualties! As a matter of fact Americans in Kosova are not threatened at all - in contrary they are all revered and greatly appreciated by everyone for bringing peace to their long oppressed country.<br />\\"What are you saving this superb military for, Colin, if we can't use it?\\" - Madeleine asked Colin Powell, Bush's state of secretary - who appearantly didn't want the American military to take on that job (Bosnia) - which would save thousands of lives and perhaps lose none of its troops. Anyways, later there was no other choice and U.S. intervened and liberated Bosnia.Now I wonder, how come mr.Colin Powell, did want the American military to take the Iraq's job when he must have known really well how crazed the Iraqis and some of their admirers really are and how organised they should really be so 100% safety to U.S. soldiers was guaranteed to them. I really had great thoughts about Colin Powell, I thought he was a very smart man but learning that he opposed actions towards serbs terror in Bosnia and seeing U.S. soldiers getting killed in daily basis in Iraq, now when he's in power yet doing almost 'nothing' about it - makes me doubt his ability to perform as a secretary of state. I really hope Democrats take over again so they could teach Iraqi's a good lesson without any casualties on our civilised side.<BR>If there only was an Albright in White House now, perhaps our troops in Iraq would have been more safer while the diplomacy would carry on.<br />Madeleine Albright, never let Clinton down just as she promised to him on the day when she was chosen as secretary of state.<BR>She always served the World in the U.S. behalf with the best intentions - and her remarkable personality and her restless work for Free and Peaceful World, will always be remembered with great admiration.<BR>WE LOVE YOU MADAME SECRETARY and We're proud of what you have done for the sake of a more peaceful world. God bless You and U.S.A., the symbol of FREEDOM and HOPES.<br />Highly Recommended.	2003-11-02

If this Kaplan pseudo-historian only knew how things will evolve in Balkans he would probably be more focused on truth then to the serb myths. And one of the main reasons why one should not waste time on this book is : This so-called writer Kaplan writes a book about Balkan's history without once mentioning the Illyrians<BR>who were the first people in the Balkans. How stupid, and I bet even this serb influenced Kaplan realises that, after all what happened to the Balkan states like Croatia,Bosnia and Kosova.<BR>My advice to future historians would be : Stick with the truth if your goal is to be a published writer because if you don't and you get published you'll remain stupid forever. I mean books survive somehow and eventually they get read by someone even after thousands of years.	2003-10-30

This tragedy made a profound impression on Goethe. <BR>As soon as this book was published, it enjoyed huge popularity and it was translated into numerous languages. It was the first German book of this kind and even Napoleon Bonaparte read this book up to seven times.<BR>The Sufferings of young Werther is a psychologic and a very tragic tale of a young man who falls in love hopelessly with a married woman. Werther proves to be very intellegent and smart but chosing what he chose to do made him indeed very stupid after all.<BR>Of course in order to find out what Werther did, and how the story unfolds - you'll have to read the book yourself but if you listen to my advice don't read it if you're in love with someone and you're single as Werther was because it wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

I mean according to the Koran I've read people like those who we see in the news will swallow fires into their bellies because they are evil and they just want to justify their ugly deeds by the Holy Book Koran. That's such a crime and I wish people like that all get hugged by the long and unescapable arms of LAW in this life as in the other life they will surely belong to hell for their evil actions against a peaceful and civilised world.<br />The proof that Koran isn't what the terrorists claim is that since I've read it I've become a different person. I was empathic,peace loving person, good doer to anyone no matter rich or poor, ugly or beautiful - now I am more empathic, and a better person than I ever was and my love for people regardless their religion or beliefs is stronger than ever before. Before I was terrified by the thunder now after I've read the Koran I don't close the curtains and hide from the lightning. I praise God for that and I find a tremendous joy seeing it. Then, I used to get disguisted by almost everything, now I don't make funny faces when I see someone eating lemon like an apple. I have been blessed in so many ways since I've read the Koran.<br />The Koran is a book of God, so anyone who reads it and understands it as it is not as you would want it to be - will find an enormous joy in life just as I did.<br />Before I give you some sayings that I took from Koran, I'd like to say that the translation wasn't that bad as some people claimed. &quot;Man are impatient&quot; - says God so perhaps that was the reason why they were so fast with their judgements.<br />&quot;God does not love evil doers&quot; - 3:51<br />&quot;Speak for Justice even if it affects your own kinsmen&quot; 6:149<br />&quot;Help one another in what is good and pious not in what is wicked and sinful&quot; 5:1<br />&quot;God desires no injustice in mankind&quot; 3:109<br />Basically, Koran is filled with beautiful and extremely smart saying such as those that I have mentioned...therefore Koran is a delight to the people who feel they have gaps in their lives.<br />Enjoy	2003-10-29

D is having his morning coffee as usual but the unexpected is soon to happen and D is taken away by serb terrorists, once his neighbours and friends.<BR>Soon,D's son, a teenager, and lots of D's cousin and friends join him in the place where they were gathering the peaceful enemies of terror. After they get maltreated in so many ways, the serb terrorists decide to send them to an administrative building in Omarska, in which place thousands join D's fate.<BR>They are to see a living hell with their own eyes, and even though their imagination in regards of their fate was quite rich, the unexpectable kept coming from serb terrorists, the runners of this death camp.<BR>The introduction :<br />1. The prisoners in the hands of terrorists, are left without food for four days then...<br />2. Later, when they were fed, they were allowed to eat not longer<BR>than two minutes as they were beaten at the meantime...<br />3. The serb terrorists, called out the names of prisoners, chose them like if they were soccer balls, and played and kicked them all over without any mercy...<br />4. The prisoners were so thirsty and the serb terrorists refused to give them water to drink so the solution to this was : ......<BR>(Goodness me)....People wetted their lips with their urine, some even drank it.<br />5. The serb students (now terrorists) called out the names of prisoner teachers and... The serb convicted criminals called out the names of presidents of justice and judges...then....<br />6. One of the favorite \\"game\\" serb terrorists enjoyed was getting an old man have sexual intercourse with a much younger lady. As a honourable man, he refused but died with dignity. Then the serb terrorists chose two man to bite two other men's genitals and they did...<br />And so so many horrible stories that will make you shiver just by reading it.<BR>We Albanians have a saying \\"A human being is as strong as steel yet as weak as glass\\". In this case, the author of this very important book must be as strong as steel to go through all that hell and still remain a normal person. I mean what would you do, if you were him??? I am terrified at the thought.<BR>Anyways, even though serbs are very familiar to me for the crimes they did in my country Kosova who is safe thanks to U.S.A.<BR>now - I found one more reason to despise them for as long as I live, and I'll make sure my descendants will despise them too forever. I mean, the serbs horrible crimes in Croatia,Bosnia and Kosova, must have made them immortal beasts and they will always remain like that in all our minds. \\"We will never forget and I hope the world will never forget either\\" - because what can you really expect from a lifetime neigbour and friend who has the ability to turn into a beast to you in a matter of minutes, and refuses to see you like a neighbour or a friend, let alone a fellow human being like they were supposed to be!	2003-10-29

She got killed, and Anne Rule wrote a book about her. A book that is gripping to the very last page. A book that breaks everyone's heart apart from people like Allen.<BR>\\"Easier said then done\\" - but Sheila today may have been alive if she was more conscious while she was alive.I've read that so many people unfortunetaly lost sympathy to Sheila for \\"she was\\" a child beater and that sort of stuff but the only time I lost sympathy for Sheila was when she decided to go with Allen to Hawaii despite the fact that Allen was a dog who was accepted in her parents home yet misused their warm, parently hospitality by ripping a lot of their money.<BR>Then, Sheila was aware of Allen's sick kinky fetish fantasies. She knew that he wore womens clothes and lots of different secrets others didn't, yet she remained his wife hoping for something that was impossible. Allen was sick by all means and he was a master to hide his ill-minded sickness to other people.<BR>Anyways, at the end Sheila divorces him finally and meets the man of her dreams Jamie who soon became her devoted husband but<BR>she could never get a divorce from Allen's hatred! He was still a great part of Sheila's daily life. He was an idiot who had everything but a healthy mind. <BR>In this book a lot of people, especially women whose husbands wear women clothes and are abusive, can learn a lot on how to avoid becoming a victim as Sheila. They're surely not normal and I don't how can it be legal for a husband and a father to wear womens clothes in public and behave like that.The thought of it makes me sick - because it is sick. So,if your husband wears womens clothes and threaten you, report them to the police. If they don't respond like they usually don't - as usual then spend a couple of bucks and buy this book for them -so maybe it'll dawn on them that they are capable of stopping crimes just as they are very capable of catching stupid people like the killers of Sheila.<BR>Yes, reading the book you'll understand that four people were involved in the murder. One of them got only $20 and nineteen years in prison. The rest - all sentenced to life in prison. How nice that justice always wins but how sad that victims always lose and that their gaps can never be filled with nothing even if these sick idiots were put in electric chairs for what they've done to HUMANS in general.<BR>And for the end I think the morale story of this sad reality is STICK WITH YOUR FAMILY if they're NICE of course, and don't swap them for anything or anyone.	2003-10-26

I knew Holbrooke was an excellent negotiator and a restless soul when it came on bringing peace to Balkans but I just didn't know how much until I've read this book.<BR>Holbrooke is such an excellent writer too and its a shame that he isn't a regular one - he'd hit the bestsellers list for every book he would write because this book was meant to be a memoir of a diplomat and you all know how confused they really are but all along I felt Holbrooke wrote a book about me and as if I was reading about myself. That is all because he wrote with such  enormous honesty and without reservations of any kind and each moment he describes in this book is so vivid. You would feel just like you have been Holbrooke himself. Anyways,it is a book that I would highly recommend to everyone, not just those who are interested in Bosnia's past because this book truly is a box full of morale stories and unlimited life strategies written by a triumphous person who worked so hard to bring peace and secure a good name to United States of America first than the rest of civilised world. <BR>What I found most interesting in this book was the moments when Holbrooke met with the greatest deceiver on Earth, Milosevic and his supporters. Most of his dialogues with them are described so vividly and after all it all seemed as if these dialogues were nothing but a chess game in which Justice through Holbrooke as U.S. proud representative - WINS with honour as INJUSTICE loses with eternal disgrace.	2003-10-07

This is a book about <BR>serbs and their terrifying crimes they've done in Bosnia, before they did the very same to Kosovo, and after they've done the very same in Croatia, and just a bit before that in Slovenia.As a Kosovar, and a serb victim too, the more I learn about<BR>what might have spurred the serbs expose their long hidden cruel<BR>fantasies towards Croatians,Bosnians,and Albanians too - the more I get confused. I mean I keep asking myself \\"Hey, did it really have to come to Bosnia...no less my country Kosovo, after<BR>all we have seen what happened to Croatia. Well, it is more than <BR>obvious that they were backed up and it would be most unfair even though everything is fair after all we have been through from their cruel unimaginable crimes - to label a western country<BR>if not all of them - for letting this happen. I mean it is just as if I am a millionaire and in my doorsteps I see a dead-starved<BR>beggar in my doorstep and not help him. I mean, come on, not that<BR>I would actually give him some food but I'll make him a honoured member of my family...anyways...it's all blood (not water) under the bridge of west's silence. GO WEST!!! Serbs, regarding Bosnia<BR>and Croatia will be forever grateful for that silence of yours. I mean how can they not??? But I am so sorry to say that because<BR>you know your profession, I mean I am clueless what is it like to be a politician or a diplomat...but yeah anyways...what really<BR>provoked tears was the writer's love for humanity and for what is right. He created an honest book even though he lived and considered Serbia as his homeland and he wasn't at all as the <BR>corrupted gen.Lewis McKenzie who was paid to be a darkness to the (bosnian) serbs crimes by serbs themselves.I am so happy at the thought that McKenzie can not possibly enjoy the money he got from the serbs because that's the way it works, but the thing I am not sure of is \\"how can he sleep at night?\\", is he buying medicines to cure his then corrupted mind and clear his <BR>consciousness of what he has done to thousands of children ( I am not mentioning the old people and other hundreds of thousands <BR>victims). Goodness me, how safe are we when UN Generals can get in the payroll of the most dreadful criminals. If I was the law,<BR>now when the waters have been cleared, general McKenzie, and some others who could have prevented genocides on innocent people (am not mentioning old people and hundreds of thousands civilians) I would all make them next door neighbours to where Milosevic is.At least, it wouldn't be that bad for them at all, because they may have missed him a lot - so it would have been a win-win situation. The justice would have been served and as I said they would have enjoyed being with each other. I wonder,did anyone ever thought about this that a non-serbian might be responsible for its irresponsibalities too??? I don't know, it makes to much sense to me that yes - someone else is responsible<BR>too because it was obvious what the serbs are after.<BR>Anyways, reading this book is just like reading all the books in Eastern European wars all caused by serbs. This book gives the very reason why did it all happen because it was written by a man who knew their language,their history,traditions, their everything and above all he was a witness to the genocide they committed. So,yeah, if you really want to know what spurred the serbs expose their true selves READ THIS BOOK and you'll see how and why did it all happen.	2003-10-05

I can imagine how hard it must have been for them watching the crazed tribe trying to eliminate another one in the most cruelest ways - and not being able or ordered to help the innocent Tutsis by stopping Hutus. The result of Hutus madness totaled to at least 800.000 thousand people murdered. Godness me, I can not think of a sadder thing but when the human's lives become numbers. Now after I've read this book I often think 800.000 lives like the one I am living right now have been taken away.And my life is precious,everyone's life is precious so was theirs and yet they have lost it while I was (along with billions of people) probably listening to music, or while I was watching a comedy - and not having a clue that Rwanda or Hutus or Tutsis even existed. I have to go now,and play my favorite song \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon and pray for a better and safer precious world we live in.	2003-04-26

I finally got convinced that Sidney Sheldon is a great writer despite what some 'proud' or 'shy' people to read his books think of him. 'The windmills of Gods' is a fiction book in<BR>which you have no idea who's who until the very last pages and they are never enough for a pleasant book such as this.<br />Mary Ashley is a great professor,a lovely person, an envious neighbour and friend. Her grandfather was a Romanian - and she's very knowledgable when it comes to Eastern Europe issues. The newly elected U.S. President was so lucky to read one of her essays on Eastern Europe so she has to be the U.S.Ambasador in Romania. She's out of breath, flattered when she receives a phone call from a president himself and to be offered the Ambasador's position but she refuses it for the sake of the family happiness. Soon, her circumstances change. Her husband gets killed in a car 'accident' so she gets another call from a president to reconsider the offer. This time she accepts it.<BR>But if she knew what was awaiting her she would probably not. She, and her whole world (two children) are in danger...for unkown reasons...and from a well know killer who is appointed by...the person she most trusted.<br />If you decide to read it please make sure you don't start in a lunch break or when you're starving.This book will want to be read in one breath.	2003-04-26

His name is Jerry Brudos.<BR>He's a devil itself in the form of a human being. He's obsessed with the women shoes so wherever he saw a nice pair of shoes in an attractive young lady he followed them up to their doorsteps.Then beat them, raped them, and stole their possesions - shoes, clothes and underwear so he could wear them and smell them when he got depressed. This wasn't enough for the psycho and when an ambitious girl in need for money knocked on his door to ask whether they'd like to buy a set of encyclopedias. He appeared to be interested and invited her in just so he could brutally kill her afterwards in his basement.This was the new beginning for him and he wouldn't stop until he got caught and confessed for all his crimes - which were a lot. Heaps. <br />This was the first book I've read from Ann Rule and I think she's a great writer. You have no choice but putting yourself into shoes of the victims,their sick worried,grieving relatives<BR>and hard police work to identify the monster. I must admit this book is depressing too. It makes you cry when you read what J.B. victims endured from him. It's so sick. Nobody can even imagine what he has done. <br />I know LAW and the ACTS are so smartly created - but letting a monster such as Jerry Brudos get away with a death penalty despite his confessions in cold blood without any regrets is something I can not understand. I may sound to tough but once you got all the proofs that exist I think he or anybody who would dare to do such things on human beings would deserve the very same - to let them know how it actually feels to torture, to let them know how cruel it is what they do to their victims even though they can never feel the pain of victims and other people's grief for the lost ones who had a great life ahead of them if they only did know not to cross jerry brudos path but how can we possibly know whose path to cross when we are born to live,walk,work,enjoy life.<br />Ironic, but the lawyers who happen to be human beings to and who could have been victims or victim's relatives advice people such as Jerry Brudos to plead not guilty as if they were insane at the time when they've done the cruel things upon another human being.	2003-04-26

Covey has to take the credits of these great people by relating to and praising his 7 habits. What I mean is,most of the times I read a book a day, I highlight important facts and sayings and later try my best to analyze them for my better future but the funny thing is You can not put them into practice until every fiber of your being wants you too so...<br />Looking at the brighter side of the moon - this book is so pleasant with triumphous stories that might have some relevance to your lives and even help you how to triumph over simple things we consider as big.	2003-04-26

She goes hiking with her Mom and her brother which argued a lot with each other about a lot of things then wanting to have a break and needing to answer a nature's call Trisha gets seperated from them but she can not find her way back. She's lost in the bush.<br />I am a huge Stephen King fan but this one wasn't what I have expected. OK. At least 95% of the plot was regarding Trisha - it almost seemed that King forgot with whom did she go hiking!<br />I struggled but I still made it to the last page when Trisha is finally found.	2003-04-26

Those who write without researching - even if they manage to publish is the same as if they didn't publish it at all because not so many people would read it.Philip J. Cohen has madea restless research and study on serbia's history and he came up with a Great book, that the world had awaited for ages.If only this book was written a bit earlier,and if only this book was read as soon as it got out by prominent figures in the international governments - I am more than convinced that they would have looked at serbia's genocide with different eyes.<BR>Perhaps a lot of my friends and people I knew (all civilians)<BR>would be alive today - spared of serb terror, specifically in <BR>the 1998-1999 war.	2003-04-06

US	46116057	RL7JM1YRTUZMZ	1878398091	658521600	Escape From Kosovo	Books	5	5	8	N	N	Well Done - Milazim and Deborah	Dear booklovers, You people who are against the violence and terror, You who see others as themselves, As a human being and as a Kosovar I would like to assure you that Mr &amp; Mrs Berisha wrote this book based (unfortunetaly) upon the true stories.In the best way they could they described the  terror the serb &quot;people&quot; did to innocent Albanians (just because they were Albanians),for centuries. This book unfortunetaly is not what we call entertainment read.. It is actually educational as it was written by the blood of thousands and thousands innocent children,pregnant woman,old and usually young people... I said educational because I'm pretty sure that after reading this book you will find out that - 'If you are in dark you can at least see the stars';... With one word you will appreciate for being an American not an Albanian...because this book is true story...because we suffered so much for centuries until people like Deborah and her fellow American fellows fighted with all they possibly could to prevent serb animals killing and burning everything we had ... our loved people,our homes,our parks where we had the memories of childhood,our photographs...our everything.	2001-01-22

I would highly recommend this book to all of you - no matter what age you are...Well done Alice and Keep Writing as your books will always have a spare place on my library...The best of luck	2001-01-22

One more thing I want to say - all my friends read this book and all of them liked it more than the other.So...what are you waiting for...read it before it's gone OUT OF PRINT :)	2000-12-26
