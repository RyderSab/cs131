Of course like most other AD/HD books I have read I don't agree with her 100 %. No, I don't think nutrition of lack of nutrition is the cause of AD/HD. I believe that we are born with our AD/HD brains and that it is genetic.  I know I have said this before that I do believe that there is a link to nutrition and AD/HD. Our brains do work differently than those with out AD/HD so maybe we do require different nutrients than others.<br /><br />  I have been taking the supplement suggested in Marcia's book for close to a year. I don't take the same name brand ones that she insists that we take though.  The supplements have been very helpful. No, they haven't made my AD/HD go away though. But, I haven't followed the actual \\"30-Day Plan\\" (I'm sure if I did my AD/HD still wouldn't have gone away...lol)<br /><br /> The author has done research. While this book doesn't not come close to proving that AD/HD is \\"caused\\" by poor nutrition it does help to support the idea that nutrition and other environmental factors do have an affect on people with AD/HD.	2003-08-13

It may give them a better idea of whether the professional who is treating them acutally understands AD/HD.<br />  Females who are currently in treatment for AD/HD should consider asking the professional treating her if he or she has read this book.
