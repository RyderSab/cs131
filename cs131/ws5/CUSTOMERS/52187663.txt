It's obvious from some of the designs that they're from another time period (1920s-1940s); there's not much call for 'luncheon sets' or chair antimacassars anymore, but those older patterns can be adapted into placemats or doilies. No visual patterns, and all the designs are written in short form, but none of the patterns are incredibly difficult. The edging patterns are nice but nothing out of the ordinary.	2000-11-17

If you haven't learned how to do split rings yet, then you'll want to master them before picking up this book. Most of the patterns are rather involved, but there are visual diagrams given to help you along the way. My favorite is the Heart Frame, great for framing a photo of a loved one or pet. I would have liked to see a few smaller, simpler patterns along with the complicated ones, but if you're looking for hearts, this is the book to buy.	2000-11-17

I'd learned how to make a basic sampler from a pamphlet-type book, but I still had dozens of questions that were left unanswered. I found the answers to nearly all of them in this book and am using it to help me with my first full-sized quilt. The writing style is easy to read, the diagrams and color photos make great illustrations, and the sixteen sampler projects are good beginner-type designs. I liked the given options for applique and making the binding, as well as the list of internet resources in the back. Project-wise, this is good for beginners or those who like small projects, but it is an excellent reference for quilters of all skill levels.	2000-11-17

After buying my first sewing machine I wanted a book to teach me the basics. Unfortunately I found this book to be haphazardly organized, putting some techniques in the front of the book that I, as a beginner, was not ready to use or learn. Sidebars and diagrams can be helpful when used properly, but there were so many in this book that they were distracting. I found the section on how to organize your sewing space to be useful, but otherwise, I'm still looking for a good book on sewing basics. This isn't it.	2000-11-17

Skin types are broken down into just dry, oily, normal and sensitive (most women have skin that falls into more than one of these categories). There are some good suggestions for what color cosmetics to wear depending on your hair coloring, but skin tone is probably more important than hair color when it comes to choosing colors. There are nice basic instructions for makeup application and how to pick the right red/brown/etc. for your coloring, as well as a checklist of makeup and tools.	2000-11-15

Some of the patterns are very unusual (triangular motifs) and all of them come in varying shapes and sizes, especially the edgings, which range from narrow to very wide. The other designs consist of four round doilies, several rectangular mats, a few patterns involving tatting attached to linen, two baby bonnets, baby booties, a luncheon set and a few collars/yokes. All of the patterns are written in shorthand. Though they have a definite old-fashioned look, the patterns would be a good addition to any tatter's library.	2000-11-15

I picked up this book on a whim but once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Hoffman has simply yet eloquently captured the moments when a cat innocently comes into a man's life and winds up winning his heart and changing his world. He's painted a realistic love story that's believable and not sappy. Cat lovers will be rooting for the kitten and the man alike, and those who haven't had the pleasure of being owned by a cat might decide that they'd like to. A charming, touching story.	2000-11-15

My husband and I are still in the house-hunting process, but this book has cleared up so many questions that we've had. The section on mortgages was especially helpful, and my husband enjoyed the chapter on negotiations (he's honing his skills as I type this!). I liked the explanations of how to figure out what a fair asking price is, as well as the tips on finding a good realtor. I do wish there were more information on FHA programs, Fannie Mae, etc., as I'm sure many readers of this book are young first-time buyers like us who don't have a huge down payment.	2000-11-15

The authors review and give summaries of sites for shopping, planning, honeymoons, community, etiquette and more.

The author has done a lot of research into the hows and whys of everything from why the letter 'x' is used in algebra to why potato chip bags are hard to open, and many more questions I hadn't even thought of. I only wish the book was divided into general categories, but it's just as fun to read it straight through and stumble across all kinds of interesting facts.

There are so few books written on the history of tatting, and this one book is a short but sweet synopsis of the origins and development of tatting over the past two hundred years. Pam Palmer has written a small book that's big on information, covering many aspects of tatting, from its relative, knotting, to modern achievements during the latter part of the twentieth century. This book is filled with interesting photographs of tatting work, shuttles and other illustrations that add to the easy-to-read text. A must-have for any tatter's library.	2000-11-15

When it was time to leave I had to smuggle it out of the house because I couldn't imagine not finishing it on the trip home! I've heard others say that compared to the rest of the series, this book is bogged down in exposition, but I enjoyed learning about the background and setting for this story. Though I have never stopped reading children's books, I haven't had such an incredible children's-book experience since Roald Dahl's &quot;James and the Giant Peach.&quot; I found the ending of the story inspired and the whole experience left me yearning for the next 'installment.'

There's a ton of basic information on everything from skin cancer to skin care during pregnancy, though most of the chapters are very short and barely touch on the subjects before moving onto something else. Too much information on nearly every kind of skin disease/rash/etc. that exists, and only one extremely brief (and not very useful) chapter on makeup.

This book is filled with recipes for homemade treatments that will keep hands and nails healthy and attractive through all stages of life. <br />Much of the book discusses topics that, while not strictly cosmetic- or beauty-related, are interesting nonetheless. The first section describes how hands work and how they're put together, sprinkling in fascinating facts such as where the word 'pinkie' comes from and how to analyze fingerprints. Directions are given for more serious applications, like a warm-up stretch and massage for hands, and for lighter practices such as palm reading. Chapter Three, &quot;Nutrition for Nails, Skin, Bones and Joints,&quot; includes common-sense advice (eat well-balanced meals, drink lots of water) but also features a chart describing which vitamins and minerals are good for hands, skin and nails, as well as a listing of nutritional supplements (what they are, what they do, signs of deficiency).<br />Nail fanatics will be eager to get to the second part of the book, which deals not only with problems and nail care, but also explains how nails are constructed, what they're made of, and what makes then grow. I found it interesting that it's a widely held belief that biting fingernails actually makes them grow. A table with drawings of example nails explains nail nutrition by describing what all those ridges and lines really mean. The section on problems and remedies gives recipes for treatments such as Nail-Biters' Aloe Vera Ointment, a soak to sooth inflammation, and instructions on using henna as a nail conditioner. All recipes include ingredients listings (for items such as essential oils and chamomile) as well as directions for use and cautions for people with allergies or sensitive skin. <br />Part III, Skin Care for Hands, features many recipes for natural hand cleansers, moisturizers and other remedies. Included are recipes for teas to relieve hand allergies and a bug bite treatment that is made of beeswax, plantain leaf oil, vitamin E and lavender oil. There are also treatments for burns, bruises, chapped skin, eczema, freckles, hives and warts. Weinberg also gives a great list of ingredients used in commercial skin products so you can check your labels and see what you're putting on your body. Part IV discusses how to care for joints by using exercises, baths and teas, all of which would be useful to someone with arthritis or another hand condition. The conclusion examines how to care for the aging hand by improving elasticity with an avocado skin cream (recipe included), as well as how to deal with age spots, bruising easily, calluses and dry skin.<br />This would make a great gift for someone (maybe yourself!) who revels in mixing up homemade beauty products---if you're unsure of ingredients, just check Appendix A, the Guide to Herbal and Natural Ingredients, which gives names, Latin names, properties and other information. Appendix B, Equipment and Tools, lists things you'll need (such as a scale, spoons, a coffee grinder) to create the recipes. If you decide that you love the book and want to dig deeper into the world of natural and herbal hand care, you'll find a reading list and resources list in the back.	2000-11-01

I wanted to read the book because I'm curious about the product reviews. Before the reviews is 100 pages of other information, some of which it was pretty tempting to skim or skip over in my rush to get to the good stuff. But I read it all--luckily it wasn't difficult because Begoun writes in a fairly entertaining style. It was interesting to read how she got into the cosmetics business (she used to be a freelance makeup artist) and how she went about writing the book (she goes undercover to makeup counters). <br />Now I think there are a few ways to go about reading the product reviews. You can read the whole thing straight through, finding out about every single product in the book, but after awhile it gets a little tiring. You can go through and look up the products you're currently using to see what she says about them (she rates with a happy face, straight face, or sad face). Or you can go straight to chapter four, where she lists the best products in each category, then go look up those products to decide what you think is best for you. <br />I liked the fact that Begoun includes retail prices next to the product name. If it's way out of my price range, then I don't bother reading about it (why torture myself?). And she also puts dollar signs next to products that she would recommend if it weren't for their outrageous prices. I like it that when reviewing certain products, she'll say, &quot;Product X is good, but product Y, at a quarter of the price, works just as well or better.&quot; Very important to those of us watching our pennies. <br />There are a few things to keep in mind when reading the book. Probably most important is that this is just one woman's opinion. It's true that she has experience in the cosmetics world, as an artist and a consumer and a businesswoman, but because she doesn't like something doesn't mean you won't. Some points, like products containing irritants, are valid for everyone-who wants to irritate their skin? Other statements, about coverage or shininess/matteness, are more personal preference. <br />For instance, she gives Revlon's ColorStay Lip Tint SPF 15 a sad face because it doesn't contain any of the three ingredients (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or avobenzone) that actually block out 80-90% UVA radiation. I love ColorStay Lip Tint in Mauvestone and wear it often, not because I think it's a sunscreen but because I like the color and how it feels on my lips. She also gives lower ratings to blushes and eyeshadows that are shiny rather than matte; while I don't wear shiny products all the time, I do wear them occasionally, so I took her statements with a grain of salt. <br />A few times she also seems to be contradicting herself. In the introduction to her Avon reviews, she writes that they have &quot;some incredible bargains, particularly in the lip and eye pencils, mascara . . .&quot; But then she gives Avon's mascaras a straight face and a sad face ratings. Does she consider a straight face an incredible bargain? In the key to ratings she says a straight face means that the product is OK but not impressive. I don't know about you, but I want all my products to be impressive. <br />Keep in mind that she tested these products on her skin; although she makes recommendations for how they would work on other skin types, unless you have the exact same skin type as Begoun you're not going to get the same results. Also remember that Begoun also has her own line of skin care products, many of which are featured in the best products section. <br />Overall I found this to be a great book for anyone who is interested in expanding their knowledge of cosmetics or who is unhappy with the products they're using now and needs a little guidance in how to find something new.	2000-11-01

Books	4	30	33	N	N	Good book for basics of general beauty from hair to makeup	While I do have a hard time picturing Stephanie Seymour sitting down and writing all of this out, Beauty Secrets for Dummies is an excellent guide nonetheless. The skincare chapters are the weakest sections; most people have skintypes that don't fall neatly into one of the few categories listed in the book, and the information on skincare products just skims the surface. <br />The chapters on hair are good at covering the basics, and the tips on coloring/processing will be useful for anyone wanting to do at-home coloring. The step-by-step hairstyling instructions mostly apply only to those with longer hair. One helpful aspect of this book, used in every section, is the suggestions given for different age groups, from teens to women in their fifties and beyond. <br />The cosmetics section is by far the most in-depth, with plenty of information on product types and application tips for just about every situation. The color section on how to get different 'looks' is interesting, but it would be easier for women to duplicate the looks if the makeup used was a more readily available, more inexpensive brand than Nars. The chapter on brows is excellent. The only thing lacking is the absence of any solid advice on choosing the correct colors for your skintone.<br />This book would be great for women of any age, though it might be especially helpful for teens or anyone else just getting into beauty regimens. It has a light tone and an 'everyone can look pretty' attitude that is encouraging.	2000-11-01

The instructions and advice are extremely basic, almost to the point where you'd need another book to supplement this one. Kudos to Cindy for appearing in the photos sans makeup, but some of the 'oh-she-doesn't-look-so-great-without-makeup-either' effect is diluted by the fact that she looks nearly perfect even without wearing cosmetics.

Not only did it give me more of an appreciation for knitting, it also made me laugh out loud more than once. Maggie's instructions are clear and the drawings are easy to follow. I've found her instructions for invisible increases and decreases to be invaluable, and I love the tips such as using 'idiot tags' and what you should carry in your knitting bag.

Tatting Collage uses a combination of simple, small motifs to create scenes and other designs on paper, fabric or for other projects. Rather than tatting standing alone, it is used with other materials to make notecards, paperweights, bookmarks and more. <br />The book consists of nine chapters and a short list of books for further reading. The first chapter gives a brief but informative history of tatting which should be interesting to even a beginning tatter. &quot;Chapter Two: Tools and Techniques&quot;, outlines the basic tools needed for tatting and gives hints for hiding ends and adjusting tension as well as for assembling a collage. There is also a section on using the book that explains patterns and abbreviations. <br />The rest of the book is devoted to the more than 60 designs used to make up the tatting collages. There are numerous patterns for small flowers such as daisies, foxglove and dandelions, as well as other plants like toadstools, vines, grapes and pine needles. A few animals (ducks, dragonflies, owls) are included, as are larger motifs such as trees, a heart and snowflakes. Most of the designs are very simple and could be made by a beginner. <br />Throughout the book the author has included photographs of finished collages with references to which motifs are included in the design. Readers are encouraged to create their own scenes by making original combinations of motifs. Instructions are included for making the bookmark and the paperweight, as well as larger cards for special occasions such as a birthday, wedding or Halloween. <br />This is a nice book if you enjoy tatting very small patterns to use on stationery or cards, if you're a beginner looking for designs to practice with, or if you like to tat &quot;droodles&quot; to use up those bits of thread left on your shuttle. This is not the book for you if you like larger projects such as doilies, substantial motifs and edgings.	2000-10-30

The book is divided into three parts; the first section, Basic Principles, is directed toward beginning tatters but is full of information that I think tatters of any skill level would find interesting. She writes an excellent explanation of how the basic tatting knot, the lark's head knot, is formed. I found this intriguing because I had never really stopped to think of how tatting is composed. After reading this section I have a better understanding of what I'm actually forming with the threads, rather than just going along and not knowing what I'm doing. <br />Nicholls also includes detailed directions on winding and holding a shuttle, great instruction for any beginner but especially for those trying to teach themselves without the help of an experienced tatter. She starts off by explaining how to make a chain rather than a ring because by using two colors for the chain, a beginner can easily see if they're doing the stitch incorrectly. Nicholls instructions are good, but there are few drawings, and as tatting is such a visual art, it's hard to make out exactly what she's saying without illustration. The instructions would be wonderful, however, if used as an accompaniment to another set of directions featuring visual aids. <br />Also included in this first section are instructions on how to begin a piece of tatting with a chain (something I couldn't figure out how to do for a long while); a examination of the importance of thread tension; and an in-depth explanation of how Nicholls likes patterns to be presented (preliminary description, construction, and a diagram). She continues with six edging patterns for beginners and a discussion of her names for certain groupings. For example, she refers to three rings together as a `clover'; a ring-chain-ring-chain pattern as a `scroll'; and so on. Nicholls also explains her system of defining medallion patterns by classifying them according to how their center is formed, and gives examples of each kind. This beginning section of the book concludes with directions on how to join new thread, how to undo your work, and how to finish a piece. She gives suggestions on what to do with tatting, such as using it for trimming, church items, and around the house. <br />The second part of the book, Enlarging the Scope, is full of information for the more advanced tatter. It includes instruction on pearl tatting, using two shuttles, node stitch, Josephine knot, and the locking stitch. One application of tatting that I found interesting was the use of rings as buttonhole loops. This section also discusses false picots, mock rings, and making consistent picots. Nicholls gives some creative variations on the regular picot, including twisted picots, frayed picots, using picots for a feather effect, and the rose picot. She goes on to demonstrate the mock picot (also known as climbing out of a ring, very effective for many doilies, snowflakes, medallions, etc.) and the mignonette stitch. She briefly mentions using tatting for lettering and using jewels and beads for tatting, although there are no instructions for either technique. <br />The book's third section is devoted entirely to the node stitch. I found this strange, since this stitch isn't widely used even today (or at least I haven't seen it featured in many patterns). Nicholls does write that she is hoping to spark some interest in the node stitch, and gives instructions on how to write patterns and diagrams and how to use picots, joins and rings with this stitch. I admire her stepping up to try and popularize this underused technique. <br />I wouldn't recommend this book to someone for the purpose of learning how to tat, but for tatters who've mastered the basic rings and chains, and for experienced tatters who would like a more in-depth look at tatting, this would be a good read.	2000-10-30

This book is one of those in the wonderful Dover Needleart Series, a group of paperback books that are inexpensive and chock full of patterns. Tatting Patterns is a republication of The Priscilla Tatting Book No. 2, A Collection of Beautiful and Useful Patterns with Directions for Working (1915).<br />Tatting Patterns packs 116 patterns into 48 pages. Many of the designs are old-fashioned, as is evidenced by some of their titles (&quot;Edging for Hatband,&quot; &quot;Silk Dress Trimming,&quot; and &quot;Hatpin Cover&quot;, to name a few). There are more than 30 edgings and insertions, along with a hanky border, a collar and a table scarf. Also included are patterns for a very lacy-looking alphabet, which I found especially attractive when compared to other alphabets that tended to be made mostly of chains. There are featured five doilies, some made completely of tatting, others combined with linen.<br />There are some unique, creative designs in the book, such as a bonbon basket (cute for weddings or Easter), a change purse, and a jabot with Battenburg rings. Tatters who enjoy making accessories will enjoy the patterns for a belt buckle, two beaded necklaces and a frog to be used on a coat. Those who like the challenge of a larger project can tackle the very elaborate tea cloth, which is composed of more than 460 motifs!<br />One problem with this book is that in most instances the photograph of the completed project isn't on the same page as the pattern, which means flipping through the book to find it or photocopying the photo to keep I handy. I also found some of the directions unclear----an advanced tatter could probably work her way through, but a beginner may need some help. But there are many patterns for projects ranging from simple to intricate, which make this book a good bang for your tatting dollar.	2000-10-30

For designs that were created during a time when tatting is often thought to have been limited to edgings  and doilies, there are some pretty creative ideas. The tatted earrings,  baby bonnets and handkerchiefs are all especially beautiful. There are a  ton of edgings to dress up clothes and linens or turn into bookmarks. I  love looking at the photographs of the models wearing the collars, they  have such a vintage look. The only thing I don't like so much is the way  the patterns are written out only in long form, which can make it easy to  lose your place.	2000-01-04

The designs that do have patterns aren't all that different from  those you could find in less expensive books. I'm also a bit intimidated by  her use of unfamiliar threads as I don't know what size they are in order  to make a substitution. I think the title &quot;More than 100 Glorious  Designs&quot; is a misnomer since there are only about fifty actual  patterns given. The one pattern I did attempt had such horribly written  instructions that even with looking at the photo I had to give up.	2000-01-04

For designs created during a time when tatting is thought of as being mostly doilies and edgings, this  collection is pretty creative. Some of the most unique designs are the baby  bonnet, earrings and boutennieres. I love looking at the models for some of  the designs, everything is so vintage. My only problem with this book is  that the patterns are written in longhand, making it easy to lose your  place while tatting.	2000-01-04

With only 25 pages of actual designs, most of the patterns consist of luncheon sets, motifs  and edgings. This book would be good if you're an advanced tatter who  enjoys creative challenges such as combining motifs to make larger pieces,  if you like the repetitiveness of luncheon sets, or if you're a beginning  tatter who wants to make a ton of simple motifs.	2000-01-04

I bought this book last fall and used it constantly throughout the holiday season, and I plan to use it to make more snowflakes during the remaining winter months. The patterns are varying, although I would like to have seen  a few more and some that were more like actual snowflakes. You can tat  these patterns in almost any size thread and add beads, glitter, sparkly  thread to make them more lifelike, and they make great ornaments for the  Christmas tree or decorations for windows or gifts. They're also nice to  tat during the hot summer months when you think you're going to suffocate  from the heat and humidity ; )	2000-01-04
