THE STALKING OF KRISTIN is journalist George Lardner Jr.'s Pulitzer Prize winning expose of the murder of his 21 year old art student daughter at the hands of Michael Cartier, a lifelong offender, aged 22, who had a rap sheet three pages long and a history of extremely violent domestic abuse.<br /><br />Kristin and \\"Castleneck\\" Cartier first met in January 1992; they dated only a few short weeks before Cartier physically attacked her. In April, Kristin was granted a restraining order. In May, she was dead.<br /><br />Lardner is unsparing in his denunciation of the criminal justice system, a system which allowed Cartier to roam free despite his repetitious record of violence. At the time of the murder, Cartier was wanted for a parole violation; the law knew where he was, but did nothing to enforce its own strictures.<br /><br />Nothing in Kristin's upper-middle-class background indicated that her life would end at Cartier's hand. She was an educated feminist from a socially stable, financially secure background. Like many artists, she was attracted to the extreme: hence the relationship with Cartier, which was both brief and violent. Like most people of her background, she believed the law would protect her; tragically, she was wrong.<br /><br />Cartier was a troubled human being, who, despite numerous chances, either could not or would not conform his behavior. Shortly after killing Kristin he killed himself.<br /><br />The System is an overburdened behemoth, content to creak along, and showing almost no regard for the offenders it processes or their victims. This is particularly true with women. Kristin's death led to desperately-needed changes in Massachusetts law which made it harder for violators like Cartier to escape justice by the mere expedient of crossing the street into another jurisdiction.<br /><br />The reader has to wonder whether the fact that Kristin was a single white female with a journalist father impacted Massachusetts' decision to reform its' laws. The answer seems to be a loud yes. Still, necessary changes were made, too late for Kristin, and too late for many. Whether they have had an impact since then is an open question.<br /><br />THE STALKING OF KRISTIN is a tragic tale of the failure of our culture to protect its most valuable assets---its children.reform its' laws.

THE HANDMAID'S TALE is Margaret Atwood's cautionary future myth of the United States (aka the Republic of Gilead) having fallen under the total domination of the Religious Right. Atwood's novel is one of the most readable and effective entries in the antiutopian genre that includes classics like 1984, ANTHEM, WE, BRAVE NEW WORLD, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and THE IRON HEEL.<br /><br />Atwood's Gilead is a society where most persons are sterile due to environmental toxins, and where women like \\"Offred\\" the narrator are used as Biblical handmaids, to bear children for the ruling elite.<br /><br />There is a sterile white heat which envelops THE HANDMAID'S TALE throughout, an almost sibilant silence to the book. Society is patriarchical and rigidly hierarchical: Commanders wear black, Wives wear blue, \\"Marthas\\" (servant women) wear dowdy green, \\"Econowives\\" (non-elite spouses) wear cheap striped dresses, and Handmaids wear billowing red with white blinders, symbolic of the menses.<br /><br />Handmaids are allowed out only to shop (the stores have pictures of foods, never worded labels), and little or no communication goes on between members of the household. This gives Offred extended periods to ruminate on her past life as a wife and mother in 20th century America, and to compare and contrast this new society with the old. Atwood has caught flack from certain quarters for idealizing our capitalist culture, but it certainly is freer than the world of Offred.<br /><br />Even in this stultified society, undercurrents exist. The Commander begins to surreptitiously invite Offred into his study to play Scrabble, and sneaks her out to one of the few remaining \\"gentlemen's clubs\\"; he complains of his loveless marriage. The Wife promises to help find Offred's vanished daughter in exchange for favors. The Chauffeur, Nick, begins a love affair with Offred; and as the book progresses, Offred becomes aware of a shadowy Underground, \\"Mayday,\\" designed to help women escape from Gilead. In the end, she leaves the Commander's house, but whether to live or die we never discover.<br /><br />Strongly pro-feminist, democratic and egalitarian, THE HANDMAID'S TALE is a terrifying glimpse into a future of darkness, the penumbra of which is already touching most Americans' lives.ander's house, but whether to live or die we never discover.

In EXODUS, Uris named a Nazi doctor whom, he asserted, performed experimental surgery on human guinea pigs in Auschwitz. The doctor sued Uris in a British court, much as QB VII's \\"Dr. Kelno\\" sues author \\"Abe Cady\\" about allegations of experimentation in \\"Jadwiga Concentration Camp.\\"<br /><br />This may well be Uris' best book. Uris, who is usually addicted to operatic plotlines, stiff dialogue, and stentorian characters handles the human dimensions of his protagonists quite nicely in QB VII; as a matter of fact, Kelno seems more sympathetic overall than Cady. It is not until the trial progresses that we see Dr. Kelno's underlying character flaws consume him.<br /><br />Uris spends a lot of time both entertaining and educating us about the traditions of the British legal system. As an American lawyer who studied in London, this reviewer was pleased to see that Uris respects (and even loves) the Common Law tradition of which he writes very well.	2005-09-23

THE GAINESVILLE RIPPER is author Mary Ryzuk's true-crime recounting of one of the most hideous serial-killing sprees on record, the slaughter of Christina Powell, Sonja Larson, Christa Hoyt, Tracy Paules and Manuel Taboada, all college students, in Gainesville, Florida in the late summer of 1990.<br /><br />These five young people were the unfortunate victims of Danny Rolling, a small-time habitual offender and confessed murderer, now awaiting execution on Florida's Death Row. As is well known, the Gainesville victims were not simply murdered---they were butchered, sexually assaulted, mutilated, and intentionally posed in what has to rank as one of the most bizarrely ritualized occurrences of its type anywhere.<br /><br />Ryzuk maintains a readable novelistic tone throughout, though at times her approach rankles. The young victims (in their late teens and early twenties) are all too predictably described as being exceptional individuals of one stripe or another. Her delving into certain private details of their lives (dating and bed partners) seems unneccessary and puerile.<br /><br />Ryzuk tries to be evenhanded in her treatment of \\"Danny Boy\\" Rolling, whom she sees as the product of a cold, extremely abusive household where severe corporal punishment, spousal abuse, and aggravated assault were near-daily happenings. The Rollings are presented as a ne'er do well working poor Southern family with a long history of deadly violence toward each other (Danny's paternal great-grandfather cut the throat of his wife, an episiode witnessed by Danny's father as a child, and a paternal uncle committed suicide with a shotgun). Danny's father and paternal grandfather were both policemen, though Ryzuk makes it evident she believes they reveled only in their ability to inflict force by authority. Danny's father is the villain of the piece, at least until Danny shoots him in the head after a minor argument (he survived). Danny's mother is portrayed as a willing victim who repeatedly fled the marital home with her sons only to return time after time. It's obvious that Ryzuk wants us to believe that Danny Rolling is the product of nature and nurture (though many people are raised in terrible circumstances and do not commit the crimes Danny did; witness his younger brother). Rolling has claimed this book is untrue; it is up to the reader to decide where and what the truth is.<br /><br />As if to undercut the sympathy she may have created for Rolling, Ryzuk's descriptions of the murders and the murder scenes veers headlong into the gory and the gratuitous. One of the worst failings of this book is Ryzuk's insistence on placing us into the mind of the killer, though whether she is relying on the record or substituting speculation for fact is not ever clear.<br /><br />Ryzuk also does poorly in trying to apply the language of law, psychology, forensics, criminology and behavioral science to Rolling's case. It's apparent she simply does not have the technical knowledge at hand, and so her attempts to sound clinical are awash with malapropisms. She mentions at one point that it is \\"[her] legally unproven belief\\" that Danny Rolling also killed the Grissom family of Shreveport, Louisiana with a similar signature; yet, she reports later that Rolling confessed to these killings; so it is not simply 'her belief'.<br /><br />THE GAINESVILLE RIPPER does do a more than adequate job of recounting this nightmarish episode, does seek to understand it, and does memorialize the victims. Tabloid in tone and substance, it is still well worth reading if you are a fan of the True Crime genre.ome with her sons only to return time after time.

This book is seminal in the Gangster genre, being author Nicholas Pileggi's excellent chronicle of the downfall of the Vario crime family of Brooklyn, and is a literal glimpse through a glass darkly into the real workaday world of organized crime. This book was later the basis for Martin Scorsese's GOODFELLAS, starring Ray Liotta, Robert DeNiro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci.<br /><br />Pileggi describes with amazing accuracy the extraordinarily insular old-world neighborhoods of Brooklyn, including the sheer blue-collar ordinariness of most of these `gangsters,' who were known, liked, and given a respectful deference  by their neighbors, casual friends and more distant relations. And in truth, 'organized crime' tended to corral 'disorganized crime' and kept muggings, hooliganism, break-ins, and petty thefts, rip-offs, and scamming almost nonexistent.<br /><br />WISE GUY concerns the doings of one Henry Hill, a lifelong wiseguy turned government informant, and how the lousy rat flipped on his friends to save his own pencil neck. Hill's testimony eventually put most of his friends behind bars, including his patronne, \\"Big Paulie\\" Vario, who died in prison at the age of seventy-three.<br /><br />WISE GUY lacks the operatic overtones of THE GODFATHER, skips the fedoras and the pinstripes, and focuses far more on the day-to-day low-end extortion, strong-arm, and petty rip-offs of a crime family really struggling to survive in a changing post-war world. Their one big score ultimately proves their undoing.<br /><br />Hill is a human barometer of the effectiveness of the Mob. Hill's decision to turn rat has no moral scruples to it, it is strictly selfish, and Pileggi manages to capture both Hill's fear (of both cops and robbers) and his absolute self-centeredness exquisitely. Hill is certainly no White Knight, and is hardly admirable as the Joe Valachi of his era.<br /><br />Henry Hill eventually emerged from the obscurity of Witness Protection to become a regular on \\"The Howard Stern Show,\\" and the proprietor of a GOODFELLAS website, where he now sells autographed mass-produced Mob memorabilia and T-shirts./>Henry Hill eventually emerged from the obscurity of Witness Protection to become a regular on \\"The Howard Stern Show,\\" and the proprietor of a GOODFELLAS website, where he now sells autographed mass-produced Mob memorabilia and T-shirts.    <br />	2005-08-27

THE CO-ED CALL GIRL MURDER is a true crime retelling of the life and death of Tina Biggar, college student by day and call girl by night, who was murdered by a delusional john.<br /><br />The authors, Fannie Weinstein and Melinda Wilson, try mightily to cast Tina as the prototypical midwestern All-American Girl, and a previous reviewer and friend of Tina's laments her death in moving tones. Still, it becomes clear that Tina Biggar was in part a very troubled young woman with serious issues relating to her self-esteem, self-worth, and body image (at 5' 7'' she weighed 150 lbs.). Offsetting this, she was personable, pretty, intelligent and diligent. Had she mastered her demons she would have excelled at life. She certainly had the potential.<br /><br />Weinstein and Wilson all but gloss over her unexpected teenage pregnancy and early relationship with an abusive boyfriend, but it is easy to imagine that Tina suffered a great deal of emotional travail from these experiences, especially coming as she did from a staunchly Catholic \\"military brat\\" family. All of this is said in respect to Tina, who certainly did not deserve to be murdered.<br /><br />It is easy to see that some of Weinstein's and Wilson's insights ring all too true. At the time of her death, Tina was living a sordid double life, keeping her identity as a call girl from her family and her live-in boyfriend. Weinstein and Wilson cast the boyfriend as somewhat of a goodhearted boob, repeatedly making silly comments, being arrested (and rearrested) for alcohol offenses, occasionally straying during the several emotionally stressful periods in their relationship, and being generally clueless when it came to Tina's wants and needs.<br /><br />It's clear that Tina could be immature, vindictive and unforgiving when provoked. She repaid her boyfriend's infidelities with her own (ultimately becoming a call girl), and was emotionally distant and neglectful---even psychologically abusive. Perhaps she was, in truth, punishing herself for some self-perceived flaw. All-American Girls do not generally choose prostitution as a job; nor do they cling to men who are clearly losers at life's game.<br /><br />Yet, Tina remained overlong with her first abusive boyfriend, maintained a personal friendship with her killer outside of her call girl role, and kept up a relationship with her long-suffering boyfriend even as she berated and belittled him. She carried on as an escort for far longer than she should have. She innocently gave the benefit of every doubt to a man with a mysterious past who eventually killed her. Tina Biggar did not make \\"a terrible mistake\\"---she made a lengthy series of them, which in the aggregate led to her death.

THE DHARMA BUMS is Kerouac's mostly autobiographical 1958 follow-up to the iconic ON THE ROAD. And, truth be known, THE DHARMA BUMS, though less known, is a far better tale than its predecessor, which embraced a rough and gritty depravity as the Beat metier.<br /><br />In THE DHARMA BUMS, Ray Smith (Kerouac) sets out for California where he meets Japhy Ryder (the poet Gary Snyder), who introduces him to the essences of Zen Buddhism, as well as the core of what was to become the counterculture of the 1960s.<br /><br />Kerouac's gentle, wide-eyed amazement at the spiritual world he has entered is manifest on every page. Whether in a North Frisco crash pad or in the Sierras, Kerouac moves through a joyous universe full of light, color, and sheer new-ness. His ability to share his inner visions on these pages marks him as a truly talented writer. THE DHARMA BUMS is a happy book. Even Kerouac's occasional bouts with alcohol and depression do not detract from the experience, they merely underscore the happiness and the heights to be found in Zen spiritual practice.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about this book, and I really do. For anyone who cares to make the journey, THE DHARMA BUMS is a great (if unfocused) primer on Zen that needs to be read for the simple pleasure of it.	2005-08-21

David Halberstam has written an entertaining, complex, and penetrating survey of the 1950s, a profoundly formative decade which fifty years later, seems rooted in an innocence that never was, a decade that claimed to be the wellspring of American ideals and yet marked their first decline.<br /><br />Halberstam manages, amazingly, to touch on virtually every aspect of the decade, from the rise of the Cold War, to Kinsey, McDonald's hamburgers, the nascent Civil Rights Movement, the rise of JFK, ever-bigger fins on cars, PEYTON PLACE, the Pill, Levittown, and Betty Furness. A fine overview, THE FIFTIES suffers only from its inclusiveness. Any one of these subjects could be the focus of a book unto itself.<br /><br />Although Halberstam debunks the myth of the black and white \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" lifestyle we all seem to remember so well, relegating it properly to make-believe, his portrait of the 1950s does reveal a national consciousness of overarching confidence, sadly lacking since then. The United States had emerged from the lean years of the Depression and World War II as the ultimate superpower; it seemed that the good life was finally yours for the asking, and that the asking price was reasonable.<br /><br />Television was the great equalizer then, just as the Internet is now; the Information Age had begun, and as the years melted into each other, more and more seemed to come faster and faster. In 1949 half the one million TVs in America were in New York City. By the end of the decade, they were ubiquitous.<br /><br />Along with TV came a flood of consumer goods, all designed to make life simpler and more pleasurable (it is interesting to read that dishwashers were initally unpopular largely because they rendered housewives' tasks too easy---and it was the housewives who were complaining!). Frozen foods and fast foods seized the market. Cars morphed from a form of transportation into a form of performance art: the '59 Caddy with its 40 inch fins and the '59 Chevy with its swooping bat wings were the apotheosis of form over function.<br /><br />And yet, in the midst of plenty, there were disquieting rumblings: the paranoia of the Cold War was at a fever pitch. The rampant consumerism of the era replaced \\"need\\" with \\"want\\". The sizzle sold the steak, regardless of its taste. Quality and craftsmanship suffered declines they have not yet recovered from, and the standardization of food, style, accommodation, and American expectation was begun. Although more and better was available  to most citizens, in retrospect the Fifties, though in many ways truly \\"wonderful,\\" seem like a decade spent preparing its denizens for a profound disappointment.<br /><br />Halberstam's thesis is that the adoption of the pleasure principle as a national mindset in the Fifties has had a seminal impact on the future we now live in. Somehow, we have lost not our moral compass but our sense of self. Rather than being less consumed with mundane tasks, we are more consumed with inchoate worry; the general optimism of the Fifties has been replaced with anxiety as we realize that the standardization of life has removed any color or individuality, replacing bedrock values with shrill greed. Fifty years on, we are expected to take what is given us, whether we will or nil. Back then, the choice was still with us. In THE FIFTIES, Halberstam does not just turn back the clock; he makes us recognize that it had just warily begun to tick.<br /><br />THE FIFTIES is the story not of a decade but of an American Evolution: More and bigger can be but is not always better, and progress is oft-times decline.were the apotheosis of form over function.

Edward Jablonski's FLYING FORTRESS is a classic of aviation literature and is unique as the earliest, best-written \\"biography\\" of any aircraft. Sometimes imitated but never duplicated, FLYING FORTRESS is a wonderful read, less military history than memoir, and anyone who does read it comes away with love in their heart for the Boeing B-17, one of the most lethal, effective, rugged, and beautiful (if such a word applies to warplanes) flying machines ever built.<br /><br />Jablonski takes us through the step-by-step evolution of this airplane, from its earliest wooden strut-and-wire precursors to its ultimate development into the B-29 \\"atomic\\" bomber of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The general design of the B-17 proceeded from Boeing's Model 299 to the wartime B-17G, of which almost 9000 were built. Although the \\"E,\\" \\"F,\\" and \\"G\\" variants were the most common of the more than 12,000 B-17s constructed, the Flying Fortress underwent literally hundreds of modifications and served variously as a heavy bomber, a command plane, a radar platform, an antisubmarine hunter, and even a kind of long-range superfighter during its decade-long career.<br /><br />The B-17 was as widely distributed as it was modified. Although the Flying Fortress is most commonly associated with the Eighth Air Force based in England, Fortresses served in Italy, Africa and the Pacific theatre as well. The B-17 (along with the B-24) was the backbone of America's Strategic Bombardment program against Germany during World War II. Although the price was steep (about 25% of Fortresses never came home) Strategic Bombardment demonstrably shortened the war by destroying Germany's industrial plant. (Strategic Bombardment really came into its own only with the development of stealth technology and smart bombs, which allowed for pinpoint accuracy in targeting.)<br /><br />Even more than the plane, Jablonski regales us with tales---some comic, some tragic---of the men who flew these planes and the dangers they faced. Jablonski rejoices in recounting the war stories of these now gray-haired old men (where they've survived), especially the exploits of the \\"Bloody 100th\\" Bomb Group (famous to this day as suffering from a Luftwaffe vendetta), and \\"Rosie's Riveters.\\" Jablonski doesn't much credit the vendetta against the \\"Century Bombers\\" except as a pilots' legend, but he does do a wonderful job of bringing to life the exploits of the B-17 crews.<br /><br />FLYING FORTRESS is rounded out with an extensive technical section (including the pilot's manual) and hundreds of photographs. (Nowadays the Web holds the actual pilot training films, a must see for anyone interested in the B-17.) The only shortcomings of FLYING FORTRESS are the lack of a table of organization for the Army Air Forces, the absence of a brief summary of the postwar history of a few of the more famous planes, and nothing regarding expanded information on insignia and nose art (which is an engrossing subject all on its own).<br /><br />The Flying Fortress still fascinates, and is still beloved. Much of the continuing public fascination with the B-17 can be attributed largely to this book, which kept the B-17 alive before the Internet made esoteric information generally available.<br /><br />A definite and definitive five star effort!ounting the war stories of these now gray-haired old men (where they've survived), especially the exploits of the \\"Bloody 100th\\" Bomb Group (famous to this day as suffering from a Luftwaffe vendetta), and \\"Rosie's Riveters.\\" Jablonski doesn't much credit the vendetta against the \\"Century Bombers\\" except as a pilots' legend, but he does do a wonderful job of bringing to life the exploits of the B-17 crews.

SEVENTEENTH SUMMER, first published in 1942 while author Maureen Daly was still in college, is a true classic of Young Adult literature, never having been out of print in more than 50 years.<br /><br />SEVENTEENTH SUMMER is the story of Angie Morrow's first love. Shortly after graduating from a private high school in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Angie, a social outsider, meets Jack, the star center on the public high school's basketball team, and the two spend the summer falling very quaintly in love.<br /><br />SEVENTEENTH SUMMER is a charming tale, but in many ways it hasn't aged well into the new century. More reminiscent of Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, or A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN than Judy Blume, the publishers really mislead young readers by displaying a contemporary young couple on the cover.  The book is redolent of extraordinarily restrictive 1930's mores. Jack and Angie embody the kind of conservative virtue that is now touted as \\"Middle American\\" to the core, but which nobody lived by, even back then. Most likely, SEVENTEENTH SUMMER was anachronistic when it was written.<br /><br />To this reviewer, the Morrow household seems frighteningly sterile, people living in proximity without a shred of intimacy.  For example, at one point, Angie's sister Lorraine begins dating Martin Keefe, a University graduate who ultimately drops her. Lorraine's pain is very real, but she never really shares her feelings with Angie. Other than a few very mild hints of something unacceptable having gone on, the lesson is lost. Likewise, Angie can never seem to share any of the wonderful new experiences of her love for Jack with her family as the book progresses, for fear of a vague sense of shame. The simple act of inviting him to Sunday dinner is a traumatic experience for Angie as her overly staid family critiques Jack's truly impeccable but not impossibly perfect table manners with disapproving glances and raised eyebrows. Angie is so embarrassed by her feelings for Jack as the book closes that she can't even hug (much less kiss) him goodbye in front of her parents as she goes off to college.<br /><br />Is Angie's sense of individual discomfort really the underpinning of our national values? Was (or is) the Morrows' closed-off mentality really the way of small-town America?

CAPE FEAR (formerly THE EXECUTIONERS, which was somewhat of a spoiler title and better changed) is one of prolific author John D. MacDonald's many classic thrillers. MacDonald, who brought the world Travis McGee, has written a short, taut frightening tale of a homicidal stalker.<br /><br />In 1943 while overseas, JAG Lieutenant Sam Bowden stopped the rape of an Aussie Sheila and helped to convict one Sergeant Max Cady, sending him up for life at Leavenworth. But now it's 1957, Bowden is comfortably practicing law in the Hudson Valley and environs, and Max Cady's sentence has been commuted. Cady smashes Bowden's idyllic Eisenhower-era life to bits by beginning the slow and deliberate hunt of his wife and children, while Sam's beloved legal system is paralyzed by its own sense of fairness.<br /><br />A  phenomenally frightening book which was made into 1962's terrifying film CAPE FEAR starring Gregory Peck (as Bowden) and Robert Mitchum (as Cady), and 1991's remake starring Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro, CAPE FEAR is one of those rare books that makes you shiver---and the Peck/Mitchum version particularly is even more effective, one of the best book-to-film translations ever. Well worth reading (and/or seeing) CAPE FEAR lives all the way up to its name.	2005-08-02

In FLESH AND BONES Paul Levine introduces us to, what is for him, a rare bird---a vulnerable, victimized woman. The only problem is that the woman, supermodel Chrissy Bernhardt, is accused of the murder of her own father, shot to death in front of a club full of eyewitnesses.<br /><br />Levine has written a taut, intelligent, entertaining, and wryly humorous psychothriller. Despite the overwhelming evidence of Chrissy's guilt, Jake takes the case and dedicates himself to finding a way out for his client.<br /><br />What transpires is a tale of sordid manipulation, exploitation, lies and incest which is engrossing from the outset and never flags.<br /><br />With FLESH AND BONES not only has Jake Lassiter inherited the mantle of Travis McGee---Paul Levine has joined Scott Turow and John Grisham as one of the best 'legal thriller' authors working today.	2005-07-27

Although author Paul Levine discredits it as \\"the worst,\\" saying it needed \\"major surgery\\" and \\"died on the table,\\" SLASHBACK is better than its creator wants to admit.<br /><br />The earliest written of the Lassiter series of books, SLASHBACK is very different stylistically from the other Lassiter novels. Written in the third person (not the usual first person narrative style favored by Levine/Lassiter), the reader sees Jake Lassiter from the outside: A more dour, short-tempered, and professionally competent man than emerges in the rest of the series.<br /><br />SLASHBACK has most of the faults and foibles of any first novel. It's clear that Levine was not familiar with Jake Lassiter's character when SLASHBACK was begun. The reader might wish that more of the getting-acquainted process had taken place even before paper met platen, but it's obvious that SLASHBACK evolved in the telling.<br /><br />The unneeded attempt to fit SLASHBACK chronologically into the series as \\"Lassiter Number Five\\" leaves some very obvious surgical scars. A simple author's note might have been redemption for a multitude of minor sins.<br /><br />Also, like most first works, SLASHBACK is rather overwritten and suffers from the cardinal flaw of new writers (one which Levine parodies throughout the series): never to use one word when three will do.<br /><br />Levine sometimes ignores the story and goes off on lyrical tangents, even quoting the Hawaiian love poem \\"Ho'oheno Li'a\\" (\\"To Cherish Li'a\\") in full in the original, a forgivable bit of authorial overzealousness.<br /><br />The story carries itself well despite the distractions. Sam Kazdoy, a Czarist-era Russian-Jewish immigrant who runs an Eisenstein movie house for his contemporaries in Miami Beach, takes up with Violet Belfry, a sometime waitress and sometime hooker, who soon discovers that Kazdoy keeps millions of dollars in bonds in his office.<br /><br />Levine's affectionate depiction of Kazdoy is an homage to the 'green' East European-Jewish immigrants of an earlier age, only a very few of whom remain today among the inhabitants of now-trendy South Beach. Levine obviously learned his Yiddish at his grandparents' knees, and his---or Kazdoy's---culinary prejudice for \\"a bagel mit a schmeer\\" even manages to affect the supposedly gentile Lassiter.<br /><br />Seeing nothing but dollar signs where before there was a kindly old man, Violet quickly enlists her sometime boyfriend Harry Marlin to break into Kazdoy's office and steal the bonds. But Harry and Violet together couldn't burgle a paper bag, and after going back twice to get it right, are stuck, cluelessly, with the bonds.<br /><br />Enter Keaka Kealia, World Champion sailboarder from Hawaii, who has come to Miami for a race, and tells the confused pair that he can cash the bonds at \\"The Great Bahama Bank.\\" Since they have no other options they entrust the bonds to Keaka, who promptly sails off into the sunset with them.<br /><br />Harry follows Keaka back to Hawaii, and so does Jake, in an attempt to recover the bonds for Kazdoy. Jake soon meets Lila Summers, Keaka's female counterpart and occasional lover. As it turns out, the bonds, like the Hawaiian Islands themselves, are only the visible part of something that goes much deeper.<br /><br />Despite its' flaws, SLASHBACK is an entertaining light read well worth the time and effort.e to the 'green' East European-Jewish immigrants of an earlier age, only a very few of whom remain today among the inhabitants of now-trendy South Beach.

As FOOL ME TWICE opens we see Paul Levine's ex-Miami Dolphin now Attorney Jake Lassiter in a new role as uncle to his half-sister's abandoned teenage son, Kip, who has been delivered into his hands by the Juvenile Justice system after an indiscretion involving spray-paint.<br /><br />Jake struggles with parenting Kip, who is a kind of walking \\"Leonard Maltin's Guide To The Movies.\\" As he adjusts to having a teenager in the house he is also defending the grifter Luis \\"Blinky\\" Baroso against a fraud charge. When a grateful Baroso is found Not Guilty he pays Jake in stock certificates from Rocky Mountain Treasures, Inc. Figuring that the stocks are so much worthless paper, Jake puts them aside, and turns his attention to Jo Jo Baroso, Luis' sister, and one of the most dynamic prosecutors in Dade County.<br /><br />Strange things begin to happen. Kyle Hornbeck, one of the partners in Rocky Mountain Treasures is found dangling from Jake's ceiling fan, and Blinky Baroso vanishes, leaving nothing but a puddle of blood in Jake's vicinity.<br /><br />Indicted for the dual murders of Hornbeck and (Sr.) Baroso, Jake discovers that Blinky Baroso conned him---and that he is the remaining Florida shareholder of Rocky Mountain Treasures, apparently very much a liquid company. Motive is everything.<br /><br />Deciding that a strong offense is the best defense, Jake loads Kip into his 1968 442 canary yellow Olds and roars off to Aspen to confront one Mr. K.C. Cimarron, the brains behind Rocky Mountain Treasures, a self-proclaimed scion of the Old West who settles his disputes with a nail gun. Suffice it to say that Jake soon finds himself on trial for murder in Colorado as well.<br /><br />FOOL ME TWICE is a humorous fast-paced story that has some creative plot twists and a classically O. Henry ending. As with MORTAL SIN, Levine has finally defined the essential Jake Lassiter in these pages. The sixth of thus far seven novels in the series, FOOL ME TWICE comes very highly recommended.	2005-07-26

Having learned the lessons about excess represented by FALSE DAWN, Levine has written a superbly crafted and finely focused thriller. MORTAL SIN is well deserving of its John D. MacDonald Award, and certainly lives up to its dedication page to MacDonald and its strong debt to Travis McGee.<br /><br />Entirely a South Florida story, MORTAL SIN is a tale of corruption, payola and murder with excellent pacing and a completely plausible premise and characters. Levine never lets go of the reins. MORTAL SIN is a fine showcase for his talents as a writer.<br /><br />Jake Lassiter, the ex-Miami Dolphins linebacker, ex-Public Defender, ex-a lot of things, sets out to defend real estate developer Nicky Florio in a wrongful death suit brought by Melinda Tupton, the widow of crusading environmentalist Peter Tupton who froze to death on the hottest day of the year at Florio's pool party.<br /><br />Complications arise. Jake is having what lawyers quaintly term a 'meretricious relationship' with Florio's wife Gina, formerly Star Hampton, retired Dolphin Doll and Jake's old live-in girlfriend. And on the last day of trial, Jake uncovers evidence that the 'wrongful death' he has just successfully defended may in fact be murder.<br /><br />A chance remark to Nicky Florio---and Jake finds himself embroiled in a vast cover-up, running for his life through the dusty courthouses of Miami, the trendy clubs of South Beach, the retirement hotels of North Beach, the golf courses that dot Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, and finally, the vast 'River of Grass,' otherwise known as the environmentally sensitive Everglades, targeted and encroached upon by men like Florio.<br /><br />A single sitting enjoyable read with some laugh-out-loud humor, wistful nostalgia, and respect for the natural world of its setting, MORTAL SIN is one of the best entries in the Jake Lassiter series, and comes very highly recommended.	2005-07-24

As a metaphor for illusion, Paul Levine could have picked no better title for this, his third Jake Lassiter novel, in which nothing is as it appears.<br /><br />Jake, Levine's comic hero ex-linebacker, ex-Public Defender, ex-a-lot-of-things, is initially hired to defend small-time hood Francisco Crespo on a murder charge. As Jake investigates the circumstances, he realizes that Crespo is not only Not Guilty of killing fellow longshoreman Vladimir Smorodinsky---he is clearly innocent, having been unconscious at the time of the killing. Yet, Crespo seems willing to take the rap. Jake asks him why---and Crespo is shortly thereafter found dead.<br /><br />Jake's hunt for the truth, which takes up the entire second half of the book, quickly begins to resemble a bucket full of freshly-dug earthworms.<br /><br />It seems that Crespo's employer, Japanese industrialist and art collector Matsuo Yagamata has business contacts in Moscow, and that Crespo's killer is a man named Kharchenko aka former KGB man Stankevich, and that the CIA's man on the scene, Foley, is an art thief or just maybe it's all been bought and paid for and is in safekeeping, and that Jake's new girl, the stunning blonde sailboarder Jillian from Minnesota is really a Finnish agent, Eva Lisa from Helsinki, and that the Cuban patriot-Exilado Severo Soto and his daughter Lourdes are really working for the CIA, or possibly it's the KGB, or it might be Fidel Castro, or maybe not, and that the Faberge egg at the center of it all is a forgery, or maybe only a rock, shades of THE MALTESE FALCON.<br /><br />In short, the plot has more twists and turns than the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. A simple double-cross doesn't exist anywhere in the world of FALSE DAWN, but there are too many sextuple and septuple-crosses going on to count.<br /><br />Poor Jake, who incessantly seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, complains more than once that he can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and the players without a scorecard. He isn't the only one struggling with this overwrought story, which sags dangerously low under the weight of its plot.<br /><br />Levine's audacious attempt to write a good old-fashioned Cold War espionage tale doesn't quite make the grade. The reader becomes lost in this rococo tale of patriotism and betrayal; I imagined Levine writing with a flow chart at his side, and wished I'd had one to follow along (never a good wish in light fiction). Levine totally loses control of the story about two-thirds of the way through and it avalanches toward a denoument that leaves the reader with an unsatisfying sense of ends left loose.<br /><br />Rather than drawing his characters in simple black and white, Levine chooses to paint in various shades of gray. Without clear right and wrong archetypes, in the end FALSE DAWN leaves the reader feeling just as dazed as Lassiter himself.<br /><br />Still, Jake Lassiter remains a sympathetic and likeable character. Levine's barbed observations about life in the social hodgepodge that is South Florida always ring true, from the Exilados to the Marielitos to the Russians, the Blacks and the Jews; not to overlook the Finns in Lake Worth. As bizarre as it all seems, we locals know these people exist as Levine presents them.<br /><br />FALSE DAWN, though by far not Levine's best work, remains more than the sum of its parts.more than once that he can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and the players without a scorecard.

NIGHT VISION is author Paul Levine's second outing with ex-Miami Dolphin-turned-lawyer Jake Lassiter. Written in 1990 (\\"Too soon for the WWW\\" as Levine once lamented), the story of NIGHT VISION concerns a serial killer using an Internet chat service to troll for victims, a novel idea at the time (no pun intended).<br /><br />While too many of the one-liners are retreads from TO SPEAK FOR THE DEAD, Levine has a stronger grasp on Lassiter's character this time around. Lassiter's social commentary on South Florida is piercing, and Lassiter himself seems less bumbling, hence less foolish, than in the earlier novel.<br /><br />The actual hunt for the signature killer is engaging, though the intervening fifteen years since NIGHT VISION was first published have added immensely to the professional literature on serial killers. Levine's research on multiple-murders consequently appears a little thin, circa 2005. It seems a flaw but it isn't.<br /><br />There are flaws. Levine unfortunately distracts himself with too many two-bit characters who add nothing to the story, and by adding nothing, dilute the plot. The interrelationships between the characters are \\"Six Degrees of Separation\\"-ish, as all the protagonists know or are sleeping with each other.<br /><br />The humor seems a little forced at times. Levine simply tried too hard in spots. Not every comment requires a snappy rejoinder.<br /><br />Still, NIGHT VISION compels you to keep turning its pages. Jake Lassiter is the kind of guy you'd want for a friend or neighbor, and he's at least competent at his profession (high praise, when one considers the public view of lawyers nowadays); it's a pleasure to find a J.D. who's not an S.O.B.<br /><br />Enjoyable light reading that comes well recommended.	2005-07-18

TO SPEAK FOR THE DEAD is the first of Miami lawyer-turned-novelist Paul Levine's Jake Lassiter novels, and it acquits itself well as an initial effort.<br /><br />Levine knows his landscape as well as fellow Floridians John D. MacDonald or Carl Hiaasen, and his characters are at least as well developed and colorful. In TO SPEAK FOR THE DEAD we are introduced to former second-string Miami Dolphin-turned-slightly stumbling attorney Jake Lassiter, his irrepressible moonshine sippin' Granny Lassiter, and his best friend, the Latin-spouting retired ME, Dr. Charlie Riggs.<br /><br />Very much a working lawyer, the self-deprecating Jake is usually quicker with his wisecracks than with his appellate arguments, but he somehow manages to be smarter than the people around him expect him to be, nonetheless.<br /><br />Lassiter's failing is idealism---he firmly believes people to be better than they are---and he struggles to discover what more cynical, jaded human beings might assume from the outset.<br /><br />Jake's recent client, Dr. Roger Salisbury has just been cleared of malpractice in the death of multimillionaire Miami developer Philip Corrigan, age sixtyish. No sooner has Salisbury walked out of the civil courtroom than Corrigan's twentysomething widow, Melanie Corrigan (aka ex-exotic dancer Autumn Rain) accuses him of murder.<br /><br />As it turns out, Dr. Salisbury and the grieving widow have a sloppily kept secret \\"history.\\" So...Is it murder? Is it conspiracy? Is it an accident...Is it revenge...? And why is Jake wearing one brown loafer and one cordovan?<br /><br />As light reading goes, this one is a page-turner, though with the low-key feel of a summer dusk at Longboat Key.<br /><br />Highly recommended fun!	2005-07-10

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a Pulitzer Prize-winning classic of American literature. It may well be one of the five greatest books ever published in English (my other candidates are the King James Bible, anything by Shakespeare, MOBY DICK, and HUCKLEBERRY FINN).<br /><br />Written in 1960, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD at first seems to be a young girl's first-person reminiscence of childhood in a sleepy Depression-era Southern town. Author Harper Lee has steadfastly denied that the book is formally autobiographical, though many autobiographic elements clearly exist (the character of Dill is the author Truman Capote in childhood, a lifelong friend of Miss Lee's).<br /><br />The children spend much of the first half of the book whiling away their time at imaginative games and summer daydreams. Their waking world is peopled by a curiously colorful collection of neighbors who range from the sublime (Mrs. Dubose, a cantankerous Confederate widow quietly addicted to morphine) to the ridiculous (Miss Stephanie Crawford, the town's indefatigable gossip). Their waking nightmare consists of Boo Radley, a mysterious neighbor who they have never seen. The children construct elaborate fantasies of Boo, but as they grow older their deliciously terrifying imaginings of the man within the house at the end of the block become overshadowed by more frightening realities in the outside world.<br /><br />The children (narrator Scout, her brother Jem, and their friend, Dill) become unjaded observers of the daily drama of ordinary human life when their father, Atticus Finch, the town attorney, is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The town becomes quietly inflamed as the submerged flotsam of prejudice floats to the surface of the residents' collective consciousness.<br /><br />Scout, Jem and Dill, along with their lifelong friends and neighbors, are forced to confront issues of justice, injustice, and their own identities, first as Southerners, second as Americans, but lastly and most importantly, as human beings who have the power to choose.<br /><br />Generations of young reviewers have attacked this book as \\"boring\\" and essentially incomprehensible. It is neither. However, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has suffered the fate of being consigned to that seventh circle of hell known as \\"the assigned reading list\\" in most high schools. As a classroom project this book can be impenetrable. I recall being forced to endure TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in my Junior year, and being unable to truly appreciate it at age 16. In part this is because it does not lend itself at all well to the usual straightforward teaching techniques of English class.<br /><br />The fact is that many adolescents have neither the attention span nor the life experience to grasp the subtle fineries that underlie this book. This comment is not meant to be an indictment of teenagers. Nor is it meant to be off-putting to young readers. It is merely an observation of the price one pays to reach adulthood. This is an adult's book, though each reader must discover for themselves where that line of demarcation lies within.<br /><br />I have always been of the opinion that literature should be enjoyed, not studied.

Harold (Hal) G. Moore's and Joe Calloway's painstakingly detailed history of 1965's Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, should be required reading for anyone interested in war, particularly those who still believe that there is something noble or glorious about men engaging in politically sanctioned slaughter.<br /><br />This prior comment is no indictment of anyone in particular, especially not the soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang, whether Americans or Vietnamese. Both sides demonstrated uncommon bravery and fortitude under fire. The comment stands however, as an indictment of the waste and horror of battle, the brutishness of men killing each other, and the cost of war in young human lives.<br /><br />The Battle of the Ia Drang was the first major engagement of United States forces against the People's Army of North Vietnam. It took place over the course of a week at two clearings in the jungle called Landing Zone X-Ray and Landing Zone Albany, and was the first battle deployment of airmobile troops in history.<br /><br />Incomplete intelligence and ill-advised orders (to find and kill the enemy, rather than to hold enemy territory) resulted in the 1st Battalion of the 7th Infantry, numbering less than 500 men, being airdropped into the red-hot center of NVA-controlled South Vietnam. The Americans were met by more than 2000 North Vietnamese regulars who were defending their major southern command post. Even before the GIs were off their helicopters they came under withering enemy fire. Moore and Calloway are terrifyingly graphic in their descriptions of the ordered chaos which ensued. Although the Americans won the day at X-Ray, they did so at an unconscionable human price. Their stand at LZ Albany, two days later, was little short of disastrous.<br /><br />Moore cuts the army brass no ice in criticizing the overall strategy behind the Battle of the Ia Drang. It should have been abundantly clear to anyone with eyes to see that the Vietnamese Communists were a superbly trained ground force utterly committed to their cause, willing to fight to the last drop of blood. The human cost of the battle and the nature of the enemy should have forced a massive reconsideration of U.S. means and goals right at the beginning of the greater U.S. committment in Vietnam. That it didn't is a tragedy.<br /><br />Although I have given WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG five well-deserved stars for its story, the book (at least the mass market paperback edition) suffers from very poor formatting. I have read voraciously for the last 40 years and this is one of the few books I have experienced that is measurably devalued by its atrocious editing.<br /><br />WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is not Hal Moore's book, but a history of the 7th Division at Ia Drang. General Moore not only includes his own reminiscences, but those of other survivors, most often directly transcribed from interviews.<br /><br />The various participants' accounts are not clearly set off from each other by conventions such as indents or font changes. As a result, they often impinge on each other confusingly, and it becomes difficult to determine whose voice is speaking at a given moment.<br /><br />Since many men are recounting their personal experiences, a single incident (or person) may be introduced and discussed several times. This undifferentiated style gives the reader an impression of weak writing, which it is not. Still, it becomes too easy to lose one's place in what at times appears to be the world's most incredibly convoluted run-on sentence.<br /><br />But for this editor's flaw, which has nothing to do with the authors or their subject, reading WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is a shattering experience everyone should share.tnamese Communists were a superbly trained ground force utterly committed to their cause, willing to fight to the last drop of blood.

Since many men are recounting their personal experiences, a single incident (or person) may be introduced and discussed several times. This undifferentiated style gives the reader an impression of weak writing, which it is not. Still, it becomes too easy to lose one's place in what at times appears to be the world's most incredibly convoluted run-on sentence.    But for this editor's flaw, which has nothing to do with the authors or their subject, reading WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is a shattering experience everyone should share.	2005-06-19

Miss Thompson also arranges for Jimmy to receive a guide dog, Leader, who becomes Jimmy's \\"four-legged eyes.\\" With Leader's help, Jimmy reclaims a life he thought was closed to him forever.<br /><br />FOLLOW MY LEADER is a good old-fashioned story of how determination helps to overcome all obstacles. Jimmy's story shows young readers how even a simple task like crossing a room can be fraught with risks, but it also encourages children to develop a sense of self-reliance, as Jimmy travels alone cross-country to the school where he meets and learns to work with Leader, and learns to adapt to the world around him.<br /><br />And lastly, it is a tale of forgiveness, as Jimmy comes to terms with the boy responsible for his accident, and ultimately, his own circumstances.<br /><br />A careful reading of the Dedication makes it clear that FOLLOW MY LEADER is semiautobiographical.<br /><br />And just as trivia:  I have always found it oddly fascinating that author James Garfield, who shares a name with a President named his protagonist Jimmy Carter, the name of another President who served decades after the original publication of this book.<br /><br />Highly readable, enjoyable, informative, and recommended for both children and adults.	2005-06-13

Catton's knowledge of his subject is exhaustive and his writing style is passionate. Drawing the reader along, Catton makes it possible to finish the three thick books in virtually three sittings.<br /><br />Catton's thesis is that the South began the war at a decided material disadvantage and he demonstrates how, even as early as First Manassas, the die was cast for a probable Confederate defeat, tempered only by the Union's initial unwillingness to see the war for what it was, a shattering epochal contest.<br /><br />The South's uncertain sense of nationhood is illuminated in its adoption of national symbols: At the Montgomery Convention, several delegates wanted to name the Confederacy the \\"United States of America\\"; Confederate generals squabbled over rank based on their West Point (i.e., Union) rankings; the South's national holiday was Washington's Birthday, it was established on Jeffersonian principles, and its Stars and Bars was confusingly similar to the Stars and Stripes, so much so as to lead to tragedies in battle. Imagine George Washington dedicating the American Revolution to Queen Elizabeth the First as a counterpoint.<br /><br />Against this, Catton posits the unsure steps of the North, at first all but willing to let the \\"wayward sisters depart in peace,\\" then battling the \\"armed combinations,\\" then fighting for Union; and finally, dedicating the war to ensuring that \\"government of the people, by the people shall not vanish from the earth.\\"<br /><br />Thanks to Catton, THE CIVIL WAR becomes a living, breathing and evolving experience, not just a history.\\" <br /> <br />Thanks to Catton, THE CIVIL WAR becomes a living, breathing and evolving experience, not just a history.	2005-06-11

But many Americans have trouble even pronouncing \\"Antietam.\\" The Confederate name for this battle, \\"Sharpsburg\\" is easier to say but less well known.<br /><br />Despite its relative anonymity, this hideous Civil War battle claimed more casualties in one day than America lost in its Revolution, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War and World War One combined.<br /><br />It's difficult even to gauge the number of battle deaths, since the low velocity and large caliber of Civil War-era weapons inflicted terrible wounds which were untreatable by the medicine of the day (no anaesthetics, no antibiotics, and no idea of antiseptics). Scores of men died of their wounds months or years after the battle. Hundreds of unknown soldiers were buried in mass graves, blue and gray together.<br /><br />As Stephen Sears shows us, tactically, Antietam was at best a draw. Strategically it put the Confederacy into a slow downward spiral from which it never recovered. It ennobled the Union cause by resulting in the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.<br /><br />Sears does a masterful job of exploring the battle, its causes, its results, and most of all, its moment-to-moment details. While LANDSCAPE TURNED RED (the title is taken from a Union soldier's report that he literally saw red in the midst of the battle) is never as vivid as a novel, it does place the reader squarely in the thickest mists of the fog of war. Sears never loses the thread, and he is able to make sense of the chaos on the field in relation to the whole, a challenging task in regard to this bedlam of a battle.<br /><br />LANDSCAPE TURNED RED is also an indictment of the waste of war. Sears admires neither battle commander. Robert E. Lee clearly believed that he could force the Union to a showdown with 25,000 underfed and ill-equipped men on Maryland soil. George B. McClellan, as was his wont, saw at least three times that many Confederates in his mind, all armed to the teeth and howling for blood.<br /><br />Although McClellan flinched at Antietam, his troops (who he claimed were \\"dispirited\\") did not, despite fearsome losses.<br /><br />Antietam was a charnel house. In part, this was due to the awful and primitive state of battlefield communications (via semaphore and courier) with a resulting lack of coordination even among the best commanders, but it was also due to McClellan's fear of losing. In McClellan's mind, a draw was as good as a win, and he maddeningly refused to shatter the rebel lines when he could have. A lifelong winner never tempered by discouragement, \\"the Young Napoleon\\" failed to realize that the key to victory is to risk defeat.<br /><br />Despite a gift for organization, and certain personal messianic pretentions, McClellan's battlefield leadership was halting, plodding and uncertain even after he serendipitously acquired a set of Lee's battle orders. By failing to press his enemy on this bloodstained day, McClellan probably prolonged the war and added immeasurably to the total death toll.<br /><br />Lee, for his part, understood that McClellan had no heart for bloodletting, and exploited this weakness to the utmost by pressing in turn. Although Lee did not flinch, he could not carry the day simply because the Yankees outnumbered and outgunned him.<br /><br />More importantly, on this particular September day in 1862, Billy Yank had discovered his own sense of esprit d'corps and did not flee as at Manassas. Neither did Johnny Reb, and this fight on the pastoral fields of central Maryland became an atavistic man-to-man slaughter which had less to do with the larger war than with motivations personal to each combatant.<br /><br />In the end, the personal element is what makes Antietam so crucial in the annals of war. After all, what drove men to fight frenziedly against each other, rifle barrel to rifle barrel and bayonet point to bayonet point? The raison d'etreof LANDSCAPE TURNED RED is the answer to this riddle.<br /><br />Sears shows us that the answers to these questions lift this battle above itself, and its participants beyond bravery.<br /><br />LANDSCAPE TURNED RED is a well-written book from every perspective, and well worth your time and attention.the answers to these questions lift this battle above itself, and its participants beyond bravery.

Nelson Lankford does a credible job of recounting the final days of Confederate Richmond in RICHMOND BURNING. His writing is vivid, colorful, and detailed, an excellent reportage that nevertheless is short on theme.<br /><br />The book suffers from too needle-fine a focus. Unlike the classic history THE FALL OF RICHMOND, RICHMOND BURNING floats disconnectedly above the Civil War landscape, barely referencing the greater historical themes of the war or the other momentous events that crowded April 1865. Lankford's Richmond in April has become Camus' plague-ridden Oran, self-contained, and somehow sequestered from the world around it. After all, why burn Richmond? The book begs a strategic answer.<br /><br />Lankford, a native Richmonder, clearly loves his city. Clearly, he despises the waste of war, and has little regard for the men who chose to burn it rather than see it fall into Yankee hands. His outrage makes sense, particularly when the reader considers that the original target of the flames (the riverside tobacco warehouses near the commercial district) were of no use whatsoever militarily but that the Tredegar Iron Works (on the outskirts) were. Had the war continued, Tredegar would have added an important resource to the Union war machine. The tobacco had nil value. The burning seems so utterly capricious when seen in that light (mine, not Lankford's, who never theorizes) that Richmonders' contempt for their serpent-cold Confederate President seems well-placed. Seemingly, Richmond burned because the leadership knew the end had come, a symbolic pyre.<br /><br />The fire consumed the commercial district but left 90% of the city intact. Lankford focuses on the 10%. As the banking and administrative center of the South, downtown Richmond had an importance greater than most city centers. As destructive as the fire was, it lasted only about a day and was quickly contained (largely by Yankee efforts). The riot that preceded the Northern occupation seems to have done little harm though Lankford lavishes much descriptive prose upon it.<br /><br />Lankford is best at ferreting out the personal reactions of Richmonders to the loss of the Cause through prodigious use of documents and diaries. Many Richmonders had to admit, ruefully, that \\"The Yankees aren't so bad considering it is them\\" while others heaped scorn upon the \\"Things\\" that had occupied their city and controlled its economy and food supply. A surprising number of Richmonders greeted the return of the Stars and Stripes enthusiastically; many others spit and refused to swear allegiance.  Still others bowed to the inevitable and became U.S. citizens again as a matter of course.<br /><br />Lankford tells us that Confederate rancor \\"lasted for years\\", though he gives us little documentary evidence that it did. Beyond this one bare sentence, Lankford fails to address the issue at all. It is clear that the era of Jim Crow was a Southern reaction to Northern domination, wherein African-Americans became surrogates for festering Southern resentments (with Northern social and legal acquiescence), but this is beyond Lankford's view.<br /><br />Lankford's finest moment comes when he describes Abraham Lincoln's modest but triumphal visit to the still smoking city, less than forty hours after Jefferson Davis had decamped for Danville. The unalloyed joy---there is no other word---of the freed people at seeing the Great Emancipator spills from the page. It brought tears to this reader's eyes and made this book memorable.<br /><br />A suggestion: RICHMOND BURNING is best read in tandem with Jay Winik's APRIL 1865 which addresses the end of the war in a broader perspective.<br /><br />A fine effort despite its shortcomings, RICHMOND BURNING definitely deserves a place on your Civil War shelf.have done little harm though Lankford lavishes much descriptive prose upon it. <br /> <br />Lankford is best at ferreting out the personal reactions of Richmonders to the loss of the Cause through prodigious use of documents and diaries.

The best single volume history of the Civil War ever written, James McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM was an instant critical and popular classic and a Pulitzer Prize winner upon its publication in 1998.<br /><br />It seems impossible, but McPherson manages to shoehorn virtually every element of Civil War America between the covers of this book. That he does so evenhandedly and without losing the narrative thread for even a moment is amazing.<br /><br />McPherson is a natural-born writer and historian whose ability to give the \\"right\\" weight to each of the thousands of issues raised in this book is nothing short of gifted. This book made his reputation as the preeminent Civil War historian of the last twenty years.<br /><br />BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM is incredibly dense, with so much information packed on a single page that certain sections could be expanded into books unto themselves, very easily. A spectacularly researched volume, footnotes pepper every page, most from primary materials.<br /><br />Despite the density of the material, the book's narrative flow is colorful and vital. The smell of cordite is thick in the air of Antietam, the flames dance in brownstone windows during the New York Draft Riots, Abe Lincoln sits preoccupied at the War Department tapping out telegrams to McClellan demanding immediate action by the Army of the Potomac, and Marse Robert watches the Confederate sun set over Appomattox with a heavy heart touched with conviction to be a good citizen of the remade American experiment.<br /><br />BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM was more recently (2003) rereleased in an ILLUSTRATED coffee-table edition. McPherson edited about a fifth of the text and removed the footnotes and bibliography. The illustrations, whether photographs, paintings, political cartoons or documents, add to the experience of reading this splendid history.<br /><br />Whichever edition you choose you will be pleased!	2005-05-17

Books	1	36	81	N	N	A Revisionist History Best Suited To The Gerbil's Cage	It's rare that I read a book so bad that I consider shredding it afterward. I am a First Amendment absolutist and firmly believe that even lemurs are entitled to free speech. This book proves my point.<br /><br />Setting out to debunk the widely-held \\"myths\\" of the Civil War, THE SOUTH WAS RIGHT! becomes a secessionist polemic somewhere around page 30. The authors go to any lengths to \\"prove\\" that the North invaded and conquered the essentially independent Southern States primarily for profits. They also seem to want to convince the reader that hosts of happy slaves were just lining up to enlist in the CSA army to get shot so Marse Robert and his Johnnies could lick Honest Abe's blue avengers.<br /><br />Of course, any book that relies heavily on numbered lists to set forth facts is written in the idiom (or idiot) of the lowest common denominator. It echoes Orwell's ANIMAL FARM in reducing all political discourse to \\"Four Legs Good, Two Legs Bad.\\"<br /><br />The historical facts are quite different than what the authors would like the reader to believe. The United States was largely Southern-dominated for most of its first century. The South was constantly seeking to expand its peculiar institution and marginalize the North, not the other way around. The \\"Lost Cause\\" which the Kennedys embrace so enthusiastically herein was really nothing more than the terrible endgame of a stupid political contest played out by a coterie of harebrained, myopic oligarchs, Yank and Reb both, who had lost sight of the nature of the American experiment. The Civil War, er, excuse me, the Southern War For Independence, cost only about a million lives on both sides and devastated eleven States so badly that some of them still haven't fully recovered. Who cares who was \\"right\\"?<br /><br />The authors close the book with an appeal to sectional pride. I don't know where these guys have been for the last forty years but there are more \\"Yankees\\" in \\"Dixie\\" nowadays than there are in Massachusetts. Aircraft, television, air conditioning and the Internet have rendered the Kennedys kind of parochial yahooism a repellent anti-American anachronism. Hey, I live so far South I have to go North to get \\"Y'all'd\\" at, I like grits and okra, and I have a yen for girls named Dixie Lee who talk real slow. I was born in Brooklyn, friends. Southern by the grace of a moving van.<br /><br />You don't have to bray like Gomer Pyle, dress like Junior Samples and be able to read like the good ol' boys who wrote this ragged book in order to appreciate the finer things the South has to offer.

This is not Foote, nor Nevins, nor Catton. A passable 500 page history, this book could serve as a basic textbook for a survey course of the Civil War. Unfortunately it adds virtually nothing new to the seemingly endless scholarship on the subject.<br /><br />While less dense than McPherson's BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM that book remains the best single volume history of the war (an opinion Weigley endorses in his endnotes).<br /><br />Weigley does a very good job in setting forth the war's root issues of cause and effect. His selection of subjects and the unequal weight he gives to battles is overly subjective, however. His battle descriptions are far too wordy, and it is too easy for a reader to lose the thread in the midst of the action.<br /><br />A good \\"introductory\\" book to the subject for those unfamiliar with it, Civil War aficionados will find this book less than interesting.	2005-05-06

Having read Shelby Foote and Allan Nevins multivolume Civil War histories cover to cover more than once, I was expecting nothing new or different from Jay Winik's slim volume. Sadly, most Civil War histories are recitations of orders of battle, and little more. Though it was an interesting show, the two hour television presentation of \\"April 1865: The Month That Saved America\\" on the History Channel seemed to summarize this book quite well.<br /><br />I am astounded and ecstatic to admit that I am wrong. APRIL 1865 is one of the finest, most striking books written on the Civil War. Far more than a history of four short weeks in time, it is an amazingly readable, turn-the-page sociological study of the United States at what was almost undoubtedly its most profound crisis point.<br /><br />Winik makes a convincing argument that secession was not an alien concept to nineteenth century Americans; nor was the perpetuity of the Union declared in the Constitution; the Founders themselves seemed vexed by the question.<br /><br />Winik posits that until the Civil War the 'united States' were a fluid agglomeration of semi-independent entities with a limited sense of nationhood. The \\"one nation under God\\" outcome of the Civil War, or even the potential outcome of a Northern Union and a Southern Confederacy living side by side, was never a certainty. Instead, the war could have, and most likely should have, led to the balkanization of America into several regional countries. That it didn't is the miracle of APRIL 1865.<br /><br />Indeed, the 'United States' may well be the creation of one man's mind, that man being President Abraham Lincoln, whose dogged tenacity to preserve the Union made postbellum America far, far greater than the sum of its parts, North and South. And Lincoln's vision would have come to naught had General Robert E. Lee (himself a scion of George Washington's line) not fundamentally agreed and called for an end to war at Appomattox. After reading APRIL 1865 it amazes me that the 'rebel' Lee was not lionized by the North for this choice.<br /><br />Winik's prose is daguerrotype-like, almost musical: \\"The bells rang that day in Washington...Cast in iron, bronze, copper, and sometimes silver...Today they rang with the hint of promise.\\" Or more darkly: \\"At dawn, after a chill, ill-tempered rain had fallen...the wounded were entombed alive by slabs of the newly- dead.\\" With an eye for view and an ear for cadence, Winik never descends from writing into typing.<br /><br />APRIL 1865 must take its place on your Civil War shelf as the first 21st-century classic about the War Between the States.PRIL 1865 it amazes me that the 'rebel' Lee was not lionized by the North for this choice. <br /> <br />Winik's prose is daguerrotype-like, almost musical: \\"The bells rang that day in Washington...Cast in iron, bronze, copper, and sometimes silver...Today they rang with the hint of promise.\\" Or more darkly: \\"At dawn, after a chill, ill-tempered rain had fallen...the wounded were entombed alive by slabs of the newly- dead.\\" With an eye for view and an ear for cadence, Winik never descends from writing into typing. <br /> <br />APRIL 1865 must take its place on your Civil War shelf as the first 21st-century classic about the War Between the States.	2005-05-04

In a sense, THUNDERBALL is where it all started and where it all ended for James Bond. Although the novel was not released until 1961, it is based upon a earlier screenplay (MR. KISS-KISS BANG BANG) written by Fleming, Jack Whittingham and Kevin McClory, many elements of which were adapted for the first Bond Films.<br /><br />(In)famously, McClory and Eon Productions became embroiled in an epic lawsuit that lasted decades over the rights to the intellectual property of SPECTRE and Blofeld. As a result, SPECTRE vanished from the later films, the producers decided never to follow another of Fleming's plotlines (much to the detriment of the movies), McClory was awarded partial rights to THUNDERBALL (which was remade as NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), and Connery was wooed home for the role, a thumb in the eye of Cubby Broccoli, who had argued with Connery years before. In the end, MGM/Eon bought everybody out, this is all a footnote,  and CASINO ROYALE is expected in 2006 with as yet an unnamed actor as Bond.<br /><br />While not one of the best of Fleming's works, THUNDERBALL has a charming wit that makes it irresistible, especially in its earlier scenes at Shrublands the exclusive health spa where Bond is forced to go for the cure.<br /><br />Fleming obviously wrote the Shrublands episode with his tongue jammed firmly into his cheek, and has a wonderful time poking fun at critics who find Bond's hedonism distressing. After two weeks of drinking wheatgrass juice and eating pine nut tofu, Bond is feeling absolutely \\"mahvelous,\\" he has practically turned into \\"Jim-Bob Gandhi,\\" and his Scots housekeeper May is in tears warning him against the danger of a grown man eating such \\"bairn's food.\\" Bond patiently explains, with the insufferable air of a true zealot, the difference between \\"live\\" foods and \\"dead foods,\\" and dismisses May with the grumbled imprecation, \\"Change of life.\\"<br /><br />But May is right. When called to action, Bond immediately reverts to steak and eggs, black coffee, Morland Balkan cigarettes, and whisky neat. His nemesis, Blofeld, by the way, indulges in nothing.<br /><br />Not so Emilio Largo, who is a true Roman epicurean. Largo's favorite indulgences are the hydrofoil yacht Disco Volante and Domino Vitali. Bond quickly develops a fondness for the latter as well, a far more explicit fondness than the films ever could describe.<br /><br />The plot is familiar to everyone who has seen the movies. (Isn't that everyone?) SPECTRE steals two atom bombs and holds the world hostage. Bond must retrieve them.<br /><br />What makes THUNDERBALL the book so vastly different from THUNDERBALL/NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is Fleming's style as an author. He is a true \\"sensualist\\" as a writer, able to pack a scene with smells, sounds, sights and textures, all while practicing an economy with words that is admirable.<br /><br />While Fleming's Bond is vaguely sketched by intent, it is Fleming's language that essentially animated the \\"James Bond Style,\\" far and beyond any one film. This is most evident in THUNDERBALL, the movie that became a book that became two movies. The Bond films merely solidified Fleming's prose.

The life story of Saul and Chris, two orphaned boys who become wards of the mysterious \\"Uncle Elliot,\\"<br /><br />BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE introduces us to a plethora of familiar Morrell elements including his seeming favorite of the agent who renounces the world just to discover that the past can never be evaded.<br /><br />Morrell admits that he enjoyed the elements of BROTHERHOOD OF THE ROSE so much that he recreated Chris as Drew in THE FRATERNITY OF THE STONE (with which it forms a loose trilogy including THE LEAGUE OF NIGHT AND FOG).<br /><br />Of the three books, this is the best by far, like the others almost impossible to put down, tensely written, and unpredictable in its twists and turns. As this is the earliest book of the trilogy, Morrell is not writing to any previous standards, and, oddly enough, his standards were highest here in then-as-yet unfamiliar territory.<br /><br />A definitive winner!	2005-04-14

Hopefully, authors Kurtz and Turner Harris will reincarnate the series at some point in the future, as it is engaging and highly enjoyable. DEATH OF AN ADEPT, moreover, moves the series in new directions.<br /><br />DEATH OF AN ADEPT finally sees Sir Adam Sinclair marry his lady love, Dr. Ximena Lockhart. The two settle into married domesticity at Strathmourne House where they are soon under attack by The Lodge of The Lynx, their nemesis throughout the series.<br /><br />Several Adepts do die in the course of the story, and in some particularly unpleasant ways. It appears that Kurtz and Turner Harris have finally realized that mere self-centered selfishness such as we've seen before in the series does not equate with real evil, and have redrawn their bad guys, particularly Francis Raeburn, as corrupt and sociopathic---in a word, vile.<br /><br />Peregrine Lovat and his wife Julia are almost overcome by an occult device known as a \\"Hand of Glory\\" made from the body parts of a gibbeted criminal. Sir Adam himself is captured by Raeburn and used as the sacrificial victim in a particularly detailed and gruesome Black Mass. Raeburn reanimates the spirit of the nefarious William de Soulis, a Scottish sorcerer of the 1700s who wreaks havoc in his new incarnation.<br /><br />DEATH OF AN ADEPT is a tale noir far more than any of its predecessor novels. There are even a few four-letter words sprinkled into the dialogue, something that hasn't happened before in this series, which always had the quaint and proper air of the drawing room about it.<br /><br />DEATH OF AN ADEPT is both a modern murder mystery and a gothic horror tale. Kurtz and Turner Harris do a fine job here. It's a shame they haven't continued the series as of yet, because here, embryonically, we have a syncretic \\"Profiler Meets Dracula\\" theme which opens up all kinds of fascinating possibilities for this already well-established series and its characters.s already well-established series and its characters.	2005-04-09

The fourth book in THE ADEPT series concerns the discovery of sacred oriental black magic texts on board a derelict Nazi submarine, and an evil Tibetan monk who turns out to be an Ubermensch hiding incognito.<br /><br />Ludlum, Follett and Forsyth could do no better in creating mesmerizing plot elements. Added to this, DAGGER MAGIC has a wonderful subplot about a character's past life incarnation that is impinging disastrously on the present day. Kurtz and Turner Harris' writing is detailed and gives the reader a fine sense of place.<br /><br />So why only two stars?<br /><br />Essentially because although DAGGER MAGIC is a quality work it's becoming very evident that THE ADEPT is getting tired. After taking a hiatus from the Lodge of the Lynx in THE TEMPLAR TREASURE, Kurtz and Turner Harris have yoked this novel to the further adventures of Lynx-Master Francis Raeburn. Somehow, you know you've read it before. It's obvious from the outset that Raeburn is going to manage to elude Sir Adam Sinclair's Hunting Lodge yet again, leading us into Book Five.<br /><br />Frankly, Raeburn isn't that interesting or that evil. Kurtz and Turner Harris haven't given the character any depth or complexity. He may be the Master of a Black Lodge but he's far too au courant to make you cheer for his downfall. Raeburn is a caricature of a nasty politician or a bad boss, not a picture of a man dedicated to all forms of wickedness. He seems to have no particular vices other than a yen for personal power, and so what? In short, Aleister Crowley he ain't.<br /><br />What the esteemed Lynx-Master should be doing is seducing schoolgirls, smoking opium, and funding assassination squads, not examining ancient grimoires with a magnifying glass. What a dangerous pastime for a man to cultivate. The worst thing I can say about Raeburn is that he's rude and treats the servants like coolies. Hardly a fit heir for all the evils of the world.<br /><br />By making their primary bad guy such a milquetoast, Kurtz and Turner Harris have practically guaranteed that the epic battle between good and evil that is the backbone of this series degenerates into a proxy fight between the impeccably tailored Sir Adam and the equally impeccably tailored Raeburn.<br /><br />I'd like to like this book. The earlier volumes all have a quirky charm which is not missing here, but this book probably would be much better if the authors had put less effort into moving their continuing plotline along and more into good plain storytelling. As it is, despite it's strengths, DAGGER MAGIC doesn't stick with you.es.

The best written book in the series, it is also somewhat like a prodigal son, having a storyline and plot totally divorced from the rest of the books.<br /><br />Rather than doing battle with The Lodge of the Lynx as in the rest of the series, Sir Adam and his associates are faced with a renegade French archaeologist and occultist, Henri Gerard, who has discovered the secret of King Solomon's treasures and is on a mad quest to recover them and the wealth and power he believes they represent.<br /><br />Kurtz and Harris are indefatigable here in providing literally chapters' worth of lore about the Knights Templar and their connections to historic Scotland, as well as finally defining the occult traditions of their protagonists.<br /><br />THE TEMPLAR TREASURE is spiced with some really intriguing medium/seance/reincarnation scenes that seem entirely plausible within the scope of the novel.<br /><br />Best of all, Kurtz has \\"borrowed\\" General Sir John Cathal Graham from her wonderful novel LAMMAS NIGHT. Gray Graham brings a whole nuanced texture to THE TEMPLAR TREASURE which makes it unique in the ADEPT series. It's clear Kurtz adores the character of Graham and his scenes make up some of the best writing in the book.<br /><br />The scene descriptions are detailed without being heavy-handed. Sir Adam, Peregrine and Inspector McLeod seem to have settled into an easy camaraderie. The stilted \\"drawing-room\\" tone of the first two ADEPT novels is muted, and the characters all exhibit a certain dry wit and a sense of poking fun at themselves throughout that makes THE TEMPLAR TREASURE a minor gem.<br /><br />Give this novel FOUR AND ONE-HALF STARS and a chance to grow on you.	2005-04-07

Fortunately, it also has an expanding cast of colorful characters who are beginning to come into their own here.<br /><br />Sir Adam Sinclair, Bt. is still too well turned out, but Peregrine Lovat has begun to shed his \\"Youthful Ward Dick Grayson\\" persona in favor of a more mature, more nettlesome individuality. Police Inspector Noel McLeod has become nearly three-dimensional as opposed to the cardboard soldier depiction of his character in the first novel.<br /><br />In LODGE OF THE LYNX Sir Adam and his Huntsmen are pitted against an evil covey of black magic practitioners who are dedicated to destroying Freemasons and Freemasonry. There's an interesting Hitlerian subplot and a good deal of accurate information on paleolithic European sacrifice rituals, as well as some generally unknown facts about Masonic practice that make this book particularly engrossing.<br /><br />The detail and settings are extremely visual, and hold the reader's attention well. Of course, Sir Adam continues to be GQ's Man of the Year---it's almost comic when he mumbles \\"I dunno\\" in response to a question after a near fatal car crash as opposed to his usual, \\"I haven't any idea, sir.\\"<br /><br />The biggest failing of this novel is its stretching of suspended disbelief to the breaking point. All good fantasy asks the reader to accept certain premises and suspend doubt in the telling of the tale. While its easy enough to believe the angelic visitations that the Huntsmen experience during an initiation ritual it is much harder to believe that Sir Adam and friends can draft the SAS to help fight the epic battle between good and evil that climaxes the book.<br /><br />Despite the somewhat over the top ending LODGE OF THE LYNX is a fine light read.	2005-04-05

Mark Bowden (BLACK HAWK DOWN) is gifted in bringing essentially unknown tales into the public eye, and here he does it again, dramatically. His ability to take the hidden and twisted threads of covert operations and weave a complete story from them is impressive.<br /><br />Pablo, as Bowden refers to him throughout, was a small-time hood who rose to true if notorious greatness on a ladder stained with blood. At the peak of his influence he had a net worth of billions of dollars.<br /><br />Pablo cultivated a jolly demeanor and, in truth, lacked couth, though he could be personally disarming. In dress, he preferred white velcro-strap Nike sneakers and blue jeans. He was short and plump. He was hardly the image of the \\"Don Pablo\\" he wanted to be. He was easy to underestimate, as the world discovered.<br /><br />At his zenith, he had all but convinced the ruling oligarchy of Colombia that coca cultivation and processing was a growth industry, even if frowned upon by staid norteamericanos with no taste for trend.<br /><br />In 1983 Pablo was elected a Congressional alternate from his state of Antioquia, ruled Medellin with an iron fist, and was a serious contender for the Presidency of his nation. Ten years later he was dead.<br /><br />Pablo Escobar was a study in contradictions. He was 'the most Wanted man in the world' who spent most of his criminal life in the open. A sociopathic megalomaniac, he saw nothing bizarre in blowing up planes and buildings and killing hundreds in the course of targeting one man. He was a devoted husband and father with a penchant for seducing teenage girls.<br /><br />Unlike some other crimelords who habitually restrained themselves from killing 'noncombatants,' Pablo gloried in taking the lives of his enemies' friends and relatives no matter how uninvolved they were in the drug trade. As a result, no one in Colombia was beyond his reach, and even the U.S. Ambassador had to live in a special security vault while Pablo was at large.<br /><br />A man who victimized others constantly, he saw himself as a victim of the State. A man on the outside he always wished to be on the inside and bought, bribed and murdered his way into positions of authority. A compleat robber baron, he spoke the rhetoric of Che Guevara, and spent hundreds of millions to rebuild Medellin into a major metropolis and made its citizens into some of the most fortunate of Colombianos. To this day, Pablo is lauded in certain quarters of Colombia as a Robin Hood-type character, but Bowden makes clear that Pablo's hero image was carefully constructed and disseminated through his vast public relations apparatus to insure his own protection.<br /><br />Pablo was a man incapable of restraint who ultimately overreached himself. Although he had most of Colombia's government in his pocket, he failed to appreciate the need for subtlety in his game of control. For Pablo, the government, the police, and ultimately the United States were just rival cartels to be bossed and intimidated. Never realizing how badly he had outmatched himself, he became the instrument of his own destruction.<br /><br />His fall came when he simply walked out of the prison he himself had built and staffed after reaching a ridiculously one-sided plea bargain with the Colombian government to stop intra-Cartel violence. Once Pablo escaped, the government of Colombia was virtually forced into a \\"hunter-killer\\" mode of operations against him, based on his own untrustworthiness.<br /><br />Aided by the United States, Colombia hunted Pablo, at first with a notable lack of zeal. Too many ranking Colombians were beholden to him. But as Pablo retaliated by attacking innocent civilians throughout the country, his public support waned and his Cartel associates faded away. Pablo soon found himself hunted by Colombian and American Special Ops troops, and a terrifying vigilante group \\"Los Pepes,\\" made up of people who had been victimized by him, Cali Cartel competitors, and other shadowy individuals. As Bowden cynically says, we need to \\"surmise\\" who they were.<br /><br />Pablo's fall changed nothing. Cali became the new cocaine epicenter and the government's ties to the drug kingpins were, if anything, even stronger. But Pablo was a clear target. Moreover, he was a man who simply couldn't stop himself from killing. It was decided at the highest levels that, like a mad dog, Pablo needed to be destroyed.<br /><br />Pablo died ignominiously, shot by a government-backed Death Squad, with his overhanging belly on prominent display in the cover photograph of the book. His hunters shaved his moustache into a Hitlerian brush for fun. Their smiles are both bitter and mocking. That one photograph, hanging in many government offices, Colombian and American, is Pablo's legacy.<br /><br />Bowden obviously has no love for Pablo Escobar, but he is also clearly equivocal about the methods and results of killing Pablo. The vast energy put into finding and eliminating this one man certainly never blunted the drug culture, but it did rid the world of one of the most powerful and amoral figures in modern history.<br /><br />There's a lesson here for the post-9/11 world.d by him, Cali Cartel competitors, and other shadowy individuals.

Oh my! Can you guess who wins?<br /><br />THE ADEPT is a fun read, but don't consider taking it seriously even for a moment. The main characters are devotees of a mishmash of Western Mystery Tradition elements that the authors never reduce into a logical system, leaving Sir Adam to utter invocations to Ra, Adonai and Christ all in one breath. If you're a purist about such things, leave THE ADEPT alone.<br /><br />Theosophy aside, the authors seem dedicated to writing in a style reminiscent of drawing room melodramas of yore. Shades of Bruce Wayne, Sir Adam lives alone at Strathmourne House except for his faithful manservant, Humphrey, who spends an inordinate amount of time pouring tea, lighting fires in the library fireplace, and making absolutely certain that his employer can make the cover of Gentleman's Quarterly at a moment's call. All right, so what's so wrong with that, your mother asks?<br /><br />The rest of the characters are equally proper with stiff upper lips that can carve the Greenland icecap into a million decorative swans in a trice. Yes, and they do use words like \\"trice\\" in this book.<br /><br />Of course, nobody really lives like Sir Adam anymore (did they ever?), even the rich and unbearably so, so...particularly them, actually.<br /><br />Dr. Sinclair's real enemies aren't the Satan worshipers of the world, they're the people who make Mr. Blackwell's List; oh yeah, and wealthy celeb wannabes like Paris Hilton and Donald Trump. I say Sir Adam should lay off the Kabbalah and give those two elocution lessons. THAT would be fighting evil.<br /><br />It's total make believe. Still, THE ADEPT entertains, and is most definitely worth a light read, especially if you want some topnotch men's fashion tips.d give those two elocution lessons.

US	51812938	R10M8YBH56ENTZ	0812966007	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A Bully Book!	THEODORE REX, Edmund Morris' second volume in a planned three volume biography of TR, begins seamlessly where THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT ended: At the pinnacle of Mount Marcy, highest point of New York State with TR looking west toward Buffalo, where the mortally wounded William McKinley lay dying.<br /><br />THEODORE REX begins with TR climbing down a mountain in motion toward the White House and it ends with TR on a train in motion away from the White House. The intervening 600 pages are a study in constant motion, as the youngest President of the United States became the catalyst of world-altering change. The United States entered his first term as a provincial hemispheric democracy; it exited his last term as a cosmopolitan world superpower. Much of the reason for that was TR by himself, who dragged the rest of the country (including an often-recalcitrant Congress) behind him, a comet and its tail.<br /><br />Unlike THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT, which focused powerfully on the personal elements which formed this extraordinary man, THEODORE REX is less a biography of TR during his Presidency as it is a biography OF his Presidency. The Roosevelt family, so crucial to him, are largely relegated to the background; only his wife Edith and his daughter Alice are fully fleshed out in these pages, Alice somewhat more so than her stepmother (despite the reputed influence that \\"Edie\\" had on so many of TR's decisions). This seems an odd lacuna, but a footnote buried in the back refers the reader to (Mrs. Edmund) Sylvia Morris's biography of Edith Roosevelt for a fully-formed picture of family influence upon the President.<br /><br />For the reader, THEODORE REX is more remote and dignified than the young \\"Teedie\\" Roosevelt who was a-rising, but that may be as much the result of Morris's necessary reliance on \\"official\\" records and the  nature of Presidential hautre, as much as any element in Roosevelt himself during this era in his life.<br /><br />This short shrift aside, Morris does a splendid job of recreating the halcyon era of the first President Roosevelt. He was a man far ahead of his time, concerned with race relations, conservation, foreign affairs, and controlling the untrammeled growth of monopolies. Morris's scholarship of TR's two terms is exhaustive. The endnotes form a small book, and are interesting, in themselves.<br /><br />Roosevelt made errors (he invited Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House, inflaming Dixie passions to a fever pitch just as he took office, and later dismissed a Black regiment at Brownsville, Texas en masse for insurrection on highly questionable, highly incomplete evidence, setting a destructive precedent in African-American relations with the Federal government), and was often tactless, both with some more conservative sectors of the public who began to think him a madman, and with members of Congress, some of whom grew to hate him outright: \\"Nobody likes him except the voters.\\"<br /><br />But Roosevelt was also the most dynamic of the Presidents, excepting Lincoln and his own cousin FDR, in that he dramatically expanded the powers of the Presidency and the influence of the Federal government in regulating business and the economy. Laws establishing general labor standards and health standards were passed (often by main force) during his time. These laws, collectively the \\"Square Deal,\\" were the underpinnings of FDR's New Deal three decades later. He created the Panama Canal, the technological miracle of the age.<br /><br />Roosevelt delayed the start of the First World War by brokering a peace between Russia and Japan (winning the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts), by masterminding the Algeciras Conference between the European Powers, and by creating a new United States Navy of all-steel battleships, the Great White Fleet.<br /><br />TR enjoyed being President. He was a genial, playful, childlike, and sophisticated renaissance man with a golden heart, a sense of noblesse oblige, and the force of temperament needed to lead the United States into the twentieth century. It was impossible not to have an opinion about TR. As one observer said, \\"You meet him, go home, and wring the personality out of your clothes.\\"<br /><br />Some of TR's problems sound strangely familiar and modern: He worked to curb the growing self-interested economic, social and political  power of Trusts, those giant corporations that controlled the American economy (some still do). He engaged in gunboat diplomacy with a Middle Eastern government over the fate of an American hostage. He squabbled with the conservatives in his own Republican Party about the bounds and balance of power. He faced economic crises that put Wall Street at risk. His was the first modern Presidency.<br /><br />His answers to the problems of the day were moral and ethical and offered America a new vision of itself. He saw the White House as \\"a bully pulpit\\" to address the American people. He led by his own example and by his own convincing arguments. Morris clearly adores his subject, but it would be hard not to find such a man engaging.<br /><br />It would not be stretching the point too far to say that our present leadership could learn a few things from emulating Theodore Roosevelt.tates into the twentieth century.

US	51812938	R15MHEMGRVEDJC	0140288503	189891237	Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War	Books	5	3	8	N	N	An Ugly Little War In An Ugly Little Place	Reading BLACK HAWK DOWN made me angry at the entrenched, bureaucratic, and unimaginative cadre of men and women who make up the command structure of the United States military.<br /><br />This is journalist Mark Bowden's masterfully written, incredibly gripping, amazingly detailed, and purportedly scrupulously accurate account of a joint Ranger-Delta Force \\"snatch and grab\\" operation conducted against Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid in Mogadishu on October 3-4 1993. Just like Steven Crane who wrote THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE Bowden has never been to war, but but he has nonetheless managed to capture the essentials of war between the covers of this book.<br /><br />It is important to remember that despite the terrible scenes of American soldiers' corpses being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu the raid itself was a success in that it bagged Aidid's top lieutenants. It is also important to remember that although the Americans were vastly outnumbered in this, their longest sustained firefight since Vietnam, they were able to drive back their attackers while inflicting very heavy losses on them.<br /><br />There was (and is) a tendency to blame President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Defense Les Aspin for the consequences of the raid, but as BLACK HAWK DOWN illustrates, the Mogadishu raid was the offspring of poor, overly predictable planning by certain field commanders, insufficient training, lousy intelligence, and an overreliance on technology that has caused the quality of the American fighting man to deteriorate over many years.<br /><br />The debacle of BLACK HAWK DOWN was not the fault of the Clinton Administration, it was the fault of a fossilized military culture which promotes officers more interested in what church a man attends than in keeping that man in top fighting trim. An officer who relies exclusively on using football idioms to describe battle plans is a man who lacks thinking skills and should be commanding a small desk not a regiment. An officer who distinguishes between Ranger wounded and Delta Force wounded in battle should be dishonorably discharged.<br /><br />The Americans were in Mogadishu (described by its unlovely but accurate moniker, \\"Mog\\") as part of a UN Peacekeeping force which ultimately became a player in Somalia's horrible civil war, a war in which a petty clan chief like Aidid was able to use mass famine as a weapon. Aidid no doubt deserved to be killed (and eventually was, by a rival clan).<br /><br />Mog itself is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hell of sand-choked streets and rag hovels, a city with light fixtures but without electricity, with pipes but without running water, with thousands of telephone poles leaning akimbo but without working telephones, a city ultimately without hope. Its one million inhabitants are divided by tribal rivalries and unified only by two elements: Misery and Islam.<br /><br />The clan chiefs are able to use both elements to attack the American forces when they come for Aidid on that hot October day. How so many hundreds of destitute Somalis managed to stockpile such an array of weapons and ammunition just points up the brutishness of their leadership and their lives.<br /><br />As the Americans are airdropped into Aidid's stronghold, the shooting starts and it does not let up. Two nearly-invincible Black Hawk helicopters are shot down and two are badly damaged by small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades. Their crews are wounded, captured, or killed. Inexcusable communications breakdowns and the sheer intensity of the Somalis' assault makes exfiltration of the Ranger/Delta attack force an immediate impossibility. They are forced to fight continuously until dawn.<br /><br />Perhaps it is Bowden's light and breezy novelistic tone, but his description of men \\"freaking out\\" when one of their number is killed is not reassuring; neither is the fact that routine training is considered \\"totally cool\\"; neither is the depiction of constant boredom-fueled Stratego tournaments. The \\"Hoo-ah\\" esprit de corps of the Rangers comes across as the bravado of preadolescent boy soldiers who practically hero-worship the irreverent Delta Force \\"D-boys\\" who disdain the normal military. If this is the mental state and readiness of the supposedly elite forces, the Regular Army must be a preschool.<br /><br />The shock of the men as they watch the \\"Skinnies\\" shoot down the terrifying Black Hawks and launch hopeless, bloody frontal assaults on their far better armed and led adversaries is palpable, but much to their credit most of the Rangers and Deltas rise above their fears and fight dynamically for each other in this pointless, unnecessary and bloody battle.<br /><br />Eighteen Americans died and one was captured. The incident led to the removal of U.S. troops from Somalia, a long-range strategic blunder that taught rogue leaders that while America could hit hard it couldn't take a punch, a lesson plan which reached its logial end on September 11, 2001. Reading BLACK HAWK DOWN gave me an insight into the U.S.'s current Iraq strategy: Not to give up the field under pressure.

In this fast-paced and fascinating book McNab lifts the veil on the training and mission of the UK's vaunted SAS, the Special Air Service, the elite military force featured in McNab's bestselling BRAVO TWO ZERO.<br /><br />IMMEDIATE ACTION is hyped as \\"the book the British government wanted to ban,\\" and its easy to see why. McNab chronicles the grueling, almost constant training received by \\"the Regiment\\" with a fine eye for detail. If anybody ever wondered what it takes to become a commando this book tells them. The intensity of the Regiment lifestyle is telling in comparison to the equivalent U.S. Delta Force.<br /><br />McNab's recounting of various field ops is eye-opening. In these days when Britain is no longer a true superpower it is easy not to recognize the wide scope of British involvement in world politics. McNab informs us that the sun still never sets on the British, empire or no. From fighting drug manufacturers in the jungles of Colombia (whatever happened to the Monroe Doctrine?) to undercover infiltration of IRA strongholds in Derry, to stopping South African (yes!) border incursions into Botswana, the SAS is there, Even James Bond doesn't get around as much in his fictional world.<br /><br />McNab himself is all soldier, all the time. His entire life's focus is the Regiment, and he cheerfully neglects three wives right into divorce along the way. His Heckler & Koch automatic rifle gets far more loving attention on these pages than his second wife, who is mentioned only occasionally as \\"working back in Germany\\". It's clear he's most at home in his self-contained man's world. His emotional maturity for anything other than work is, self-admittedly, not very impressive. Given that he's one of the most highly decorated soldiers in the UK, fate seems to have dealt him a good hand though.<br /><br />This reviewer's primary (entertaining?)(negative?) criticism of IMMEDIATE ACTION is its linguistic style. It's written in \\"English\\" (as opposed to \\"American\\"). Even having lived in London for a while I struggled with McNab's idioms. There is a glossary at the back, but it isn't very good. McNab uses the word \\"bone\\" as an adjective throughout the book, apparently an example of Regiment-speak. \\"Bone\\" is translated as \\"Naff,\\" which doesn't sound complimentary, but it took me most of the book to really get the sense of what McNab meant. I still don't know what a \\"Baruki Sangar\\" is, and there's even a picture of one in the book. Beware the Jabberwock, my son...ACTION is its linguistic style.

By way of introduction I should say that I am a biased reviewer. Having been born in New York City and having lived in Oyster Bay for the first three decades of my life, I am a member of the Theodore Roosevelt Association and The Friends of Sagamore Hill. Therefore, Edmund Morris's biography of TR is a wonderful trip back in time over familiar ground.<br /><br />To a denizen of Oyster Bay, \\"The Colonel\\" is not just an historical figure, but a living, breathing presence who walks our streets to this day. There are still Roosevelts living in town (so many have lived there over time that in fact the towels at Roosevelt's home are embroidered \\"R of S\\" for \\"Roosevelt of Sagamore\\") and almost all the local watering holes boast some association with \\"Teddy\\" (he hated that nickname, by the way). Nobman's Hardware, recently burned down, was TR's hardware store, c. 1910.<br /><br />Morris does a phenomenal job of capturing Roosevelt's life from its beginnings in antebellum Knickerbocker New York, and splendidly paints us a portrait in words not only of this amazing man, but of his incredible family (Theodore Roosevelt Sr. founded Chemical Bank and the American Museum of Natural History among his many accomplishments; TR's mother Mittie Bulloch Roosevelt was the inspiration for Scarlett O'Hara; his Bulloch uncles built the Confederate raider CSS Alabama; his brother Elliott was Eleanor Roosevelt's father AND FDR's godfather; his sisters were both doyennes of official Wahington's social circles).<br /><br />Most impressive of all is TR himself, who in six overwhelming decades of life was born a morbidly ill youngster who by sheer drive turned himself into a naturalist, an ornithologist, an historian, a biographer, a New York State Assemblyman, Governor of New York State, Police Commissioner of New York City, a Federal Civil Service Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, a Ranchman, a big-game hunter, a Colonel commanding a regiment in the Spanish-American War, an Amazon explorer, Vice President of the United States, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in any category, the inspiration for the Teddy Bear, the man who named the White House the White House, father of the Panama Canal, the first President to fly in an airplane, the first President to travel in a submarine, an aspirant for the Mayoralty of New York City, the only third-party Presidential candidate to come in second, and our nation's 26th Chief Executive...<br /><br />After lunch he...<br /><br />...Edmund Morris is clearly dazzled by the man, and THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT reads almost like a novel, so effortless is the writing and so compelling the subject. Traveling through the years with TR is FUN. Morris never becomes cloying and never loses sight of the fact that TR in his heart was always \\"about six.\\"<br /><br />As The Colonel said about his favorite coffee...\\"It's good to the last drop!\\"Amazon explorer, Vice President of the United States, the first American to win the Nobel Prize in any category, the inspiration for the Teddy Bear, the man who named the White House the White House, father of the Panama Canal, the first President to fly in an airplane, the first President to travel in a submarine, an aspirant for the Mayoralty of New York City, the only third-party Presidential candidate to come in second, and our nation's 26th Chief Executive... <br /> <br />After lunch he... <br /> <br />...Edmund Morris is clearly dazzled by the man, and THE RISE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT reads almost like a novel, so effortless is the writing and so compelling the subject.

First novels do usually have flaws, and these are flaws that many novels of the genre share, first or not. Most of them never acheive the quality and pace of this book, which seizes your attention and holds it throughout.<br /><br />All in all, SPY DANCE is a more than credible first effort.	2005-02-03

These fascinating and alluring creatures who hover on the edge of reality have been the inspiration for a whole \\"gothic\\" subculture, thousands of films, and innumerable stories. While everyone is familiar with Bram Stoker's 1897 classic DRACULA, fewer people are familiar with J. Sheridan LeFanu's CARMILLA (1872) which directly inspired it.<br /><br />If ever you question this \\"inspiration\\" read Stoker's short story DRACULA'S GUEST, originally a chapter of the larger book which had been edited from the original DRACULA manuscript for reasons of length. Carmilla makes a brief, absolutely recognizable pseudonymous appearance.<br /><br />LeFanu's novella is short (about 100 pages) but tensely and tautly written. The story of a lonely country squiress, Laura, who is visited by the mysterious stranger Carmilla, the story lays the foundation for all vampire tales to come. LeFanu's story also contains a powerful if understated erotic subplot of lesbian sexuality, an element which runs through all subsequent vampire literature (most notably in the Hammer Films' adaptations of CARMILLA). In this regard, the vampire was a perfect vehicle for published erotica in the staid Victorian era, an early example of the wedding of sex and violence in popular culture.<br /><br />More well-written than DRACULA and at least equally intriguing, CARMILLA deserves serious attention from any devotee of the genre.	2004-10-30

The photographic quality is superb. The history of the magazine is well-documented. The book does skimp on many of the capsule biographies of the 512 beautiful women who grace these pages. The Playmates of the Year, perennial favorites such as Bettie Page and Pamela Anderson, famous Playmates such as Stella Stevens, and Playmates who met infamous ends (Jayne Mansfield, Claudia Jennings and Dorothy Stratten come to mind), are given far more coverage than the average, perhaps fairly so.<br /><br />THE PLAYMATE BOOK brings humanity to these otherwise often anonymous pin-up girls, many of whom suffered social ostracism (particularly in the early days of the magazine) for daring to bare all, and shows the Playboy Playmates to be an eclectic and interesting group of women with widely divergent lifestyles. Some of their stories are wonderful, some are tragic, some involve jets, yachts and 'beautiful people' while others involve kids and picket fences. There is no one 'definitive' Playmate.<br /><br />The book's greatest failing is its inability to bring it all together. More than just a \\"family album\\" THE PLAYMATE BOOK should be a social history of women over four decades, but sadly does not editorialize even briefly on \\"what it all means.\\" It's a bad oversight on the part of the editors, and takes away from the finished product.<br /><br />It's fun to see the evolution of the Centerfold over time, the changing styles, the increasing daring. It's also fun to find your favorite Playmate(s) and discover what she is/was doing (circa 1997). Hopefully, PLAYBOY will update this book periodically, and add new Playmates as they appear.	2004-09-29

Walter Lord is still universally regarded as \\"the man who knows everything about the Titanic\\" and this fast-paced, detail-laden, and dramatically visualized book is the reason why and the product of that reason.<br /><br />A NIGHT TO REMEMBER transports you to the decks of the Titanic that cold April night so convincingly that you are left with an eerie chill-between-your-shoulder blades feeling as the great ship goes down.<br /><br />You share the early complacency of the passengers on the 'unsinkable' ship. Your sense of impending doom grows as the bows disappear below the glassy Atlantic. You grit your teeth at the obtuseness of the crew of the Californian---why, oh why, didn't they question those white rockets?---and you share in the breathless trauma of those on shore as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Sure, since the discovery of the wreck many questions have been answered (and a few more posed). Some of Lord's information is dated (the ship did in fact break in half, for example). There have been other 'Titanic' books, and they explore almost every aspect of the disaster in meticulous detail; even Lord's follow-up [[ASIN:0380732033 The Night Lives On: The Untold Stories & Secrets Behind the Sinking of the Unsinkable Ship-Titanic]] falls into this category. But no one has ever told the story of the RMS Titanic any better, and it's likely they never will.	2004-09-19

Formatted as a kind of mini-coffee table book, this is H. Paul Jeffers contribution to the lore of &quot;The Gentle Art.&quot;<br />Jeffers loves pipe lore and shares tales and poems and songs, and all manner of design and marketing information. There are a few historical and informational errors here and there, and the book skimps on pipe smoking techniques, but it is amusingly written and entertaining in a light way.<br />Jeffers does  not have the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot; approach of Richard Carleton Hacker (whom he quotes frequently). Jeffers' pipesmoking habit is an exercise in pleasure and fun, not the grimly serious side of the equation (though what could be  &quot;grimly serious&quot; about the pleasures of the pipe defeats me. However, others will out).<br />See you 'round the fire!	2004-04-13

Prange's AT DAWN WE SLEPT is, like Shelby Foote's three volume [[ASIN:0307290468 The Civil War: A Narrative (3 Volume Set)]] and Alan Nevins' [[ASIN:B000V1JY8M THE ORDEAL OF THE UNION IN 8 VOLUMES (complete)]], a masterwork of historical research that is unmatched in its attention to detail, its writing style (edited and completed by others after Mr. Prange's death along with the companion volume [[ASIN:0140068147 Miracle at Midway]]), and its ability to weave literally thousands of disparate elements into a penetrating analysis of why we slept at dawn.<br /><br />Although the detail sometimes becomes overwhelming, it also puts human faces to the protagonists, both Japanese and American. Prange's thesis, that the dynamic Japanese nation felt constrained by American geopolitical goals, is the cornerstone of most modern scholarship on the outbreak of the Pacific War.<br /><br />America's isolationism and complacency is also addressed. Although the military had frequently war gamed an attack on Oahu (and the Japanese studied these war games in detail), it is nothing short of incredible that the U.S. considered the Japanese at most a second-rate threat, and did nothing to prepare for what had long since been foreseen.<br /><br />In its exhaustive examination of the events leading up to December 7th, we can read a cautionary tale. There is no question but that December 7, 1941 and September 11, 2001 and kindred days with kindred histories. Those who do not learn from history are so terribly doomed to repeat it.	2004-04-02

Yet failure was a condition which dogged him throughout his life.<br />Crowhurst's decision to undertake the circumnavigation was both dramatic and ill-considered. With relatively little sailing experience and a lot of bluff he convinced his sponsors to fund the building of a revolutionary trimaran, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" equipped with all manner of electronic wizardry (Crowhurst had invented a sort of early GPS, the Navicator, in the mid-60's).<br />Unfortunately, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" was never properly completed, the race deadline having intervened, and Crowhurst sailed in a boat that was unfinished, poorly provisioned, and untested, having done miserably in what passed for sea trials.<br />Setting out on the latest possible day, Crowhurst found himself limping along at a ridiculously slow pace three weeks later. Plagued by equipment failures, the \\"Teignmouth Electron\\" was taking water due to design flaws, and had no real chance of completing the race. Having staked all on a successful outcome, the tension and isolation of his predicament attacked Crowhurst's mind.<br />In a fit of brilliant madness, Donald Crowhurst spent hours working out and logging false positions, sun sights, weather reports, and sailing notations to make it seem he was circling the earth while in fact he meandered pointlessly through the South Atlantic for months. He even secretly put in to port for repairs, a fact which was not discovered until after the race, when his \\"real\\" logs were reviewed by investigators.<br />Crowhurst's position reports and daily runs were diligently reported onshore; he was (falsely) credited with a record run of 243 miles in one day, a record he actually matched in reality once he decided to begin sailing in earnest again.<br />In the meantime, for all the world knew, Crowhurst was going to be the winner of the Golden Globe. As he turned toward home, the media hoopla grew wilder, and so did his delusions. His log entries degenerated into irrational philosophic and religious ramblings in which he began to believe himself God. In the end, tortured by his demons and consumed by guilt, Donald Crowhurst jumped into the sea, leaving his boat to sail on without him.<br />Brilliantly and sensitively written, without tendering excuses the authors Tomalin and Hall never lose sight of the essential humanity and frailty of their subject, as well as his consuming but undirected brilliance. Relying heavily on Crowhurst's logs, it is devastating to watch the man's mind unravel in the face of his aloneness.<br />Crowhurst's singlemindedness got him far, but it ultimately proved his undoing as he was unable to see any but the options he had limited himself to, the ultimate one being his own destruction. As Camus wrote, \\"In the end there is but one serious philosophical question, and that is suicide.\\" Crowhurst's answer is his legacy.was (falsely) credited with a record run of 243 miles in one day, a record he actually matched in reality once he decided to begin sailing in earnest again.<br />In the meantime, for all the world knew, Crowhurst was going to be the winner of the Golden Globe.

CASINO ROYALE introduced the world to James Bond, and James Bond introduced the world to a style of living which, although fictional, is just SO attainable---just---that there isn't a man who hasn't tried or at least dreamed.<br />Ian Fleming's Bond is spare and tough, a kind of Spartan in a sack suit. In that regard he has influenced the cinematic Bond, but has never been the same character as portrayed by Connery, Lazenby, et. al. Fleming's writing is uncomplicated but finely crafted, and the story is dark and mordant with a strong central thread of tension and suspense which never wavers.<br />This earliest novel has an almost 1930's feel to it, with a healthy dose of immediate postwar Cold War paranoia. Things are never as they seem. CASINO ROYALE immediately introduces us to two of Bond's favorite preoccupations---women and casinos. Bond is paired with the incredibly sensuous Vesper Lynd, and the two set out to foil the plans of LeChiffre, the Russian agent fallen on hard times who is desperately trying to recoup some Moscow-funded business losses to the tune of 50 mil.<br />Bond beats LeChiffre at the gaming table and then LeChiffre beats Bond, who is naked and tied to a chair at the time. While the language is restrained, Fleming leaves us in no doubt as to our hero's predicament. Unlike his modern-day counterparts, Fleming doesn't have to be cartoonish or pornographic to draw us a prose-picture, and that, more than anything, recommends his work.<br />After so many years of being out-of-print in the U.S., Penguin finally had the verve and the nerve to release the complete Fleming ouevre in an attractive set with some really dynamic cover art.What a pleasure to see the Master returned at last.	2004-03-12

After six years of hermitage and isolation he finds himself at the center of a complex plot, when all his monastic brethren are killed in a search and destroy mission focused upon him.<br />Drew leaves the monastery and reenters the mundane world in order to hunt the hunters. What results is a tautly written book with enough action and fascinating details on tradecraft to keep any reader fascinated.<br />The plot is not quite as engaging as THE LEAGUE, which had some truly O. Henry elements. However, it is a dynamic story which moves at a strong pace throughout. Particularly entertaining are Drew's reactions to the outside world after so many years as a recluse. Morrell is not only observing here; he is making social commentary.<br />Definitely worth the time and effort.	2004-02-21

But long before Lectermania, Harris tried his hand at writing what was then an improbable tale of Palestinian terrorists launching an attack upon that bedrock of American icons, the Super Bowl by putting a bomb aboard the &quot;Aldrich&quot; blimp.<br />In the aftermath of 9/11, Harris' book reads uncomfortably like history that hasn't happened yet. In 1973, the story seemed absurdly far-fetched; in 2004, it seems taken from the headlines. With the Super Bowl upon us, BLACK SUNDAY is enough to give you the shivers.<br />Harris is an obvious journeyman novelist in this book. His characters are all stock, from the deranged Vietnam vet who plans the attack to the Palestinians who help him carry it out, to the tough-as-nails Israeli agent who is hunting them. Despite the predictability of the characters, the story races along at a tremendous edge-of-your-seat clip right up until the end, when Harris doesn't redouble the staccato rhythm of the rest of the book, essentially ending the book with a sputter and not the bang the reader anticipates.<br />Given the book's continued popularity, it's a shame Harris never rewrote his last ten pages. Nonetheless, BLACK SUNDAY is a wonderful light read, more effective now because it seems so much more realistic.	2004-01-31

In legend, the monster is said to have done his work almost too well.<br />Sadly, the same can't be said of this book, which quickly begins to sag under the moral temporizing of its author. The story of Joseph Golem, the monster who would be a man, is hopeless and distressing.<br />It's clear that Rothberg borrowed his tragic Golem from Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; just as Shelley borrowed the concept of a manmade man from the Golem legend. It's also clear that Rothberg borrowed his plot from Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle.&quot;<br />Nothing good seems to happen to the Jews of Prague, who become co-conspirators in their own destruction at the hands of a mob. All the while, their leadership debates the &quot;morality&quot; of allowing people to be killed rather than kill.<br />It soon becomes abundantly clear that none of the characters has the courage of their convictions except Friar Thaddeus, the instigator of the anti-Jewish riots. This lack of conviction condemns the Jews, who are decimated by the riots. It also condemns the Golem, who, intead of taking up cudgels to protect his community, turns his back on them, and like Low and the others, ultimately becomes his own worst enemy.<br />Rothberg was undoubtedly trying to write &quot;Literature,&quot; and was trying to address issues endemic to the human condition in this book. He was also clearly referencing the Holocaust. He deserves credit for trying. It's a near miss.<br />Unfortunately, his Golem story leaves the reader feeling bereft and angry. The Jews of Rothberg's universe are all of them weak, cowardly, and possessed of the attitude, &quot;if not us to die, then who?&quot; Despite the book's sermonizing, the failure of the Golem is not an ethical failure as Rothberg would have it, it's simply a failure of nerve.<br />Apparently, Rothberg is one of the &quot;old school&quot; of Jewish-themed writers who believe that suffering is the non plus ultra of all Jewish experience, and that martyrdom for the sake of martyrdom is its own rationale. It's neither an appealing attitude, nor was it ever historically effective.<br />Rather than perpetuating the myth of weakness, it would have been far better had Rothberg's Golem been an iron giant. Certainly, Rothberg could have posed the same moral and ethical questions, but perhaps his answers would have been far different, and his storytelling more palatable.

Jimmy Doolittle lived to be nearly one hundred, and his zest for life explains why.<br /><br />Best known for leading the \\"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\\" Raid of 1942, Doolittle did so much more. A true aviation pioneer,barnstormer, inventor, and rugged individualist, he was also the holder of an engineering doctorate, literally dozens of piloting records, and was a happily married man, to boot.<br /><br />There are no skeletons unearthed, and no deep critiques of the literally thousands of people who passed through Jimmy Doolittle's life, including gold miners and Presidents. This is a memoir in the best sense, not character assassination masquerading as autobiography. Sometimes silence is golden.<br /><br />On the other hand, Doolittle's self-effacing, humorous brand of Self is reflected in the amusing letters he received from friends such as Roscoe Turner and General \\"Georgie\\" Patton. His was an era of true loyalties and good old fashioned gumption.<br /><br />Jimmy Doolittle was a man who loved life, and it shows.	2003-12-12

His summation of Japanese history from the time of Perry until 1941 is enlightening. His central thesis of wartime Japanese behavior as an institutionalized perversion of the Bushido Code is also meaningful and well thought-out.<br />FLYBOYS fails where it tries to preach moral equivalency. Bradley takes an almost pornographic delight in recounting episodes of rapine and pillage on the part of the Japanese (in China) and the Americans (on the frontier and in the Philippines). While there is no question that the American frontiersman brutalized the Native American population, and that horrific excesses occurred during the Huk Insurrection (as they do in any war), these brutalities arose not so much from a policy of state as from no policy at all. The habit and custom of collecting Indian scalps in the 19th century may be hideous in retrospect, but it is a far cry from a Japanese armed forces standard policy of eating prisoners of war in the 20th (other rations might or might not have been available to the Japanese troops).<br />Likewise, Bradley's criticism of the firebombing of Japan as excessively destructive seems well-placed until the reader remembers the extraordinary tenacity of the average Japanese soldier when faced with an enemy. Although Bradley wants to put the word \\"fanatic\\" in quotes, it does not really belong there. An army whose officers and rank-and-file routinely brutalized conscripts and viciously executed (and ate) POWs is by definition an army of fanatics. A nation which could give rise to such an army is a nation of fanatics. Such a nation should be broken (and was).<br />There is no requirement (as Bradley would have it) to take the Japanese nation out for an ice cream by way of recompense. What was, was. FLYBOYS recounts a terrible episode in the annals of war, and does so intelligently. I will agree that the U.S. doesn't deserve an ice cream either.

The story of the May 1996 climbing disaster on Everest as told by one of the survivors, Jon Krakauer succeeds in creating an impossible-to-put-down page turner of a story out of what is, in fact, a truly depressing tale of death, waste and selfishness.<br />While Krakauer does not have the poetic ability of Peter Matthiessen in THE SNOW LEOPARD, INTO THIN AIR is a workmanlike job of journalism which, like ALIVE, manages to capture a devastating moment in time. As a professional climber, Krakauer knows of what he speaks though he is quick to admit his own limitations as a mountaineer, an admission all the more telling, as he is one of the more experienced members of this guided climb up the tallest mountain on earth.<br />The tragedy's roots lie, first and foremost, in the fact that Mount Everest has become the quintessential \\"fast food\\" mountain. Although Krakauer defers from outright criticism , it is clear that the guided climbs will accept virtually anyone as a client as long as they have a healthy checkbook.  There is no glory, no romance, no silence, no time for thought, and little need for skill on the flanks of the mountain. Everest has become a trash-strewn freeway for climbers of every stripe and talent (or not-talent). Krakauer writes uncritically of a \\"traffic jam\\" of a dozen climbers or more from multiple teams just below the summit which delayed both ascenders and descenders, perhaps fatally, but never remarks on the irony that the greatest peak on earth has become so tame.<br />Except of course that it hasn't. The altitude alone can cause climbers' hearts and brains to bleed, the lack of oxygen at 25,000 feet-plus can lead to confusion and impaired judgement on the part of even experienced climbers, the thin atmosphere can cause murderous hypothermia, and the weather---with Everest's spire thrust into the jet stream---is notoriously fickle.<br />Yet, Everest's mountaineers (guided and not) trudge by the dozen past the frozen bodies of those who have died on the mountain in failed attempts, apparently without reflection. The owners of the guided climb companies seem cavalier in the extreme, setting dates and times for ascent and descent which become extremely elastic in practice. Krakauer admits that it is hard to tell a client who has paid $65,000.00 to climb Everest that he can't push on to the summit, but the reader has to wonder what has happened to good judgement and professionalism? After all, a CPA from Des Moines should not be given a choice between ego and death, particularly when that death may be the death of others. The pollution and commercialization of Everest is sickening, and in a way, far more horrifying than the 100 degrees below zero snow gale in which these dozens of amateur climbers found themselves.<br />The storm which killed them was an act of nature, implacable and impersonal both. An inherent risk of climbing, Krakauer nonetheless spends a fair amount of time wondering what, if anything, could have been done to save his compatriots. At 29,000 feet can there be ethics in the lifeboat?<br />Krakauer is clearly drowning in survivor's guilt, but the reader suspects that had he attempted a rescue he might have joined the dead. And to what purpose?<br />INTO THIN AIR reminds us that nature is not Disneyland.ge by the dozen past the frozen bodies of those who have died on the mountain in failed attempts, apparently without reflection.

OUTLAW STATE is this New York Times Diplomatic Correspondent's view through a glass darkly into the heart of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Written just after the First Gulf War, it could serve as a primer on just why there is a Second Gulf War. Considering that this book contains valuable information regarding the true nature of Hussein's regime, OUTLAW STATE is well worth a serious review.<br /><br />The Iraq Sciolino visited was a Stalinist state with an Emperor-Worship cult that Djugashvili would be proud of. The two keywords of Iraqi life were \\"fear\\" and \\"forbidden.\\" Saddam is a documented madman who has gassed his own population, chopped dissenters (real and imagined) literally into pieces, and made war with his neighbors for no reason whatsoever except paranoia and megalomania.<br /><br />Believing himself to be the reincarnation of Nebuchadnezzar and a relative of Saladin (born in Saddam's home village of Tikrit), Saddam was reputed to see himself in messianic terms as the ruler of a greater Arab empire or a new Caliphate. Saddam insisted on creating ersatz Mesopotamian ruins (complete with \\"prophecies\\" proclaiming his own eventual appearance on the world stage) and forcing children to mindlessly recite Baath Party dictums (one is reprinted here, comically mangled by a little girl who mentions the \\"national I forgot\\"). While squandering Iraqi oil money on showy palaces and the pleasures of the flesh, most Iraqis today are impoverished as a result of his personal greed.<br /><br />Scolino gives example after example of the Iraqi leader's unbalanced world view, from the public beating of Embassy personnel to the private executions Saddam seemed to thrive on. Certainly, OUTLAW STATE is a moral justification for his overthrow, without the inflated threat of WMD.<br /><br />Never having learned the Arabist-mercantile approach of the bazaar, Scolino related that Saddam relied on brute force to coerce what he wanted from whom he wanted it. When he bragged to fellow dictator Assad of Syria that he could \\"destroy America and Israel in one blow\\" Assad's response was \\"You're crazy. If you've never fought the Israelis you know nothing about military might.\\" Never mind the Americans, Assad seemed to add.<br /><br />Scolino does point up a few positives: Until the Iran-Iraq War, the necessities of life and luxury consumer goods were readily available. Ordinary Iraqis were treated to an array of \\"perks\\" unheard of in the West, all based on oil money. Free automobiles (with free gasoline)and immense periodic cash disbursements were as common as free health care and education.<br /><br />Saddam, to his credit, reveled in building an ultramodern Iraq with a cutting-edge infrastructure. Although the populace prospered in the early years of the regime, Saddam's fixation on war and on maintaining his police state eroded and finally undid his utopian visions of a modern Iraq. The US-led UN sanctions were merely the endgame in a long cycle of collapse. Iraq's citizenry has nothing now but dreams and terror.<br /><br />OUTLAW STATE is frightening. A reader can imagine that the reportage is slanted (Iraqis are portrayed as characteristically dour and reserved, unusual traits for the usually hospitable Arab people) but perhaps that is the slant. There seemed to be little good to report in this oil-rich nation-state concentration camp under Saddam.

That is, in essence, the biggest problem with Bill Bonanno's book. Although written in what seems to be straightforward English, the values he espouses and particularly the manner in which he espouses them are so impenetrable to the average reader that BOUND BY HONOR might as well be written in Sanskrit.<br /><br />Part autobiography, part history, part memoir and part apologia, BOUND BY HONOR is Salvatore \\"Bill\\" Bonanno's personal record of growing up inside one of New York's Five Families. Bill Bonanno was the first of the Mafiosi to go public with his written reminiscences, being the subject of this book and Gay Talese's [[ASIN:0061665363 Honor Thy Father]] which is also recommended. His father, Joseph Bonanno later wrote [[ASIN:0312979231 A Man of Honor: The Autobiography of Joseph Bonanno]], and his wife Rosalie, [[ASIN:0312979258 Mafia Marriage]].<br /><br />As autobiography, BOUND BY HONOR is engrossing, although it is clear almost from the outset that Bonanno is not a reflective man able to step outside himself and evaluate his life with any real objectivity. The truth is that Bonanno is more comfortable with the concept of living in eighteenth century Sicily than twentieth century America, and apparently internalized and romanticized the values of the Sicilian Vespers without questioning them. Bonanno speaks well of \\"family,\\" \\"honor,\\" and \\"pride,\\" and deplores their erosion in the United States, speaks robustly of \\"our world,\\" but never remarks on the inherent contradictions of internecine gangland warfare which pitted brother against brother, literally, too often ending in death.<br /><br />Bonanno handles his history fairly well, although to hear him tell it, the Bonanno Family was the most powerful, most well organized, and most effective of the Five Families (other authors would dispute this hotly). He claims that his father, Joseph Bonanno was the inspiration for \\"The Godfather,\\" Vito Corleone and that he himself was the inspiration for Michael Corleone. (This reader at least saw in his actions more of Sonny Corleone.) He also spends much of the earlier portion of the book drawing parallels between his father and Joseph Kennedy, and himself and JFK. Bonanno utterly misses the irony in comparing even Joseph Bonanno the Mafioso to the base, amoral, manipulating and serpentine senior Kennedy, never recognizing that that such a comparison is no honor to his own father.<br /><br />As memoir, Bonanno is careful to move deftly around self-incriminating facts and circumstances. Since there is no objectivity between these covers, there is no way of assessing whether he has altered the facts to fit his view, but that is a virtual certainty. He attempts to minimalize the urban \\"Banana War\\" of the mid-1960s, reporting that little violence actually occurred, but he is unable to explain away (nor does he try to explain) the deep schisms in the Bonanno Family which led to this conflict. He denies and ignores the Bonanno Family's documented involvement in the drug trade. He describes the ill-fated Commission meeting at Apalachin (broken up by the local police) as a comedy of errors, but he cannot ignore the long repercussions of that day in 1957. Vice, illegal gambling, and other illicit activities are described as of minor importance to the Family and of no real harm to the community. Bonanno, however, is indefatigable in recalling his involvement with every subpoena, every grand jury, every hearing, every wiretap, and every government-machinated attempt to discredit the Families. His sense of outrage at having to do prison time for credit card fraud is manifest, though he glosses over most of his jail time and the reasons for it in a brief paragraph toward the close of the book.<br /><br />In his apologia, Bonanno blames the downfall of the Families on attrition, essentially on the succession of \\"Americanized\\" leaders over the older Sicilians as they died off. In this, he may well be right. The stable nexus of \\"Family\\" unquestionably withered as the old Sicilian blood ties were replaced with alliances of convenience. He derides a rat like Valachi and a histrionic Don like Gotti with venom, pointing out that the \\"Dapper Don\\" ruled his Family for mere years not decades. More to the point, Bonanno sees the downfall of \\"his world\\" not as the result of vast societal changes in the 1960s and 1970s, but as the result, ultimately, of a single act, the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He posits that it was one of Sam Giancana's crew, Jimmy Roselli, who was the triggerman in Dallas. Since Roselli is dead and there is no corroboration available, Bonanno ends his book, Sphinxlike, with an intriguing, but essentially unanswerable riddle.they died off. In this, he may well be right.

Mario Puzo's story spawned the most phenomenally successful movie series in history, and arguably two of the greatest films ever made. The story is an engrossing read, chronicling the rise and fall of America's most powerful (fictional?) crime family.<br />Michael Corleone's famous movie tag line, &quot;I'll make him an offer he can't refuse&quot; is nearly absent, but the equally chilling and more definitive Vito Corleone line, &quot;I'll reason with him&quot; is present in abundance. These two bits of dialogue underscore the ultimate difference between father and son, but Puzo is a raconteur, not a psychologist, and barely scratches the surface of his characters' motivations. Leave that to Francis Ford Coppola.<br />It's often said that &quot;the book is better than the movie.&quot; In this case, not. THE GODFATHER is a potboiler that's fun to read on vacation, and it belongs comfortably on the nightstand, but it is neither great literature nor even particularly well-written. The story and the characters transcend the telling, which is why the book translated so magnificently to film.<br />Coppola was inspired when he took the book's raw material and created a new universe with it, and Puzo essentially made a career out of THE GODFATHER. CRIME AND PUNISHMENT it isn't, but THE GODFATHER is definitely worth a read or five.	2003-03-07

This American Muslim's tale of jihad is both cautionary and enlightening.<br />Collins grew up as a street kid in California. After what must rank as one of the most dysfunctional childhoods on record (he practically saw his drug addicted alcoholic mother murdered before his eyes, and counts the words of his mother's killer as the most meaningful he has heard), Collins took up a life of petty crime. A stint in the California Youth Authority changed his life when he adopted Islam as his faith and decided to make Jihad, a holy war for the protection of fellow Muslims, his calling.<br />His wanderings on behalf of Jihad took him from Kashmir to Afghanistan (where he was trained by Al-Qeda operatives) to Kosovo to Chechnya. Along the way, Collins found his faith eroding as he came to the realization that not all Mujahidden were motivated by the same deep religious convictions he felt and they verbally espoused. It was at this point that he decided to work with the FBI and CIA in undermining Islamic terrorists.<br />Collins' experiences with the FBI/CIA are telling. Stuck in bureaucratic neutral and unable to discern between mainstream Muslims and self-serving fanatics, the U.S. Government kept attempting to have Collins infiltrate mosques while he insisted the real terrorists were elsewhere. Although he became friendly with several 9/11 operatives, his warnings were ignored by his handlers, and ultimately 9/11 happened.<br />Collins is a vivid storyteller, and his descriptions of life in Chechnya and Kosovo are rich in detail. Some of his war stories carry a whiff of fish, (he reflects that his war wounds must 'look cool'), but they are an engrossing read nonetheless. The book's great weakness is Collins' own: Insight.<br />Collins has a shortcoming common to tougher-than-nails men. He sees the world in black and white. Unable to detect shadings of gray, he repeatedly takes everyone he meets at face value, almost always believes what he is told, and is repetitiously disappointed, sometimes tragically so, as when he cannot rescue his Chechen wife and infant daughter from the war. His shock that his FBI handlers are \\"careerists\\" is poignant and touching. His outrage at Islamic terrorists is palpable, and carries a sense of personal betrayal that is almost adolescent in its profundity. He lionizes the Chechens despite their own less than spotless record of crimes against humanity, and damns the Russians universally as war criminals.<br />MY JIHAD is also short on background. After all, WHY Jihad? Why is there a war in Chechnya in the first place and why did Aukai Collins go there? WHY have certain \\"Islamic\\" factions decided to declare war on the West? Collins admits he is no Qu'ranic scholar, but these are questions that any man who finds himself face to face with an Azerbaijani assassin needs to ask himself at some point. Hopefully, when Collins does he will share the answers with us in his next book.gs of gray, he repeatedly takes everyone he meets at face value, almost always believes what he is told, and is repetitiously disappointed, sometimes tragically so, as when he cannot rescue his Chechen wife and infant daughter from the war.

Well, with &quot;The Complete James Bond Lifestyle Seminar,&quot; he has, and it is between the covers of one volume.<br />Unlike most of the 'Think Positive and Grow Rich' genre, Kyriazi is very forthcoming in telling colorfully unrestrained &quot;war stories&quot; from his own experience, which in itself is rich and varied. He was the only movie producer to create a black and white Techniscope film; a costly blunder from which he learned much about moviemaking and marketing his products and himself. Ultimately, he found himself in the cockpit of a Boeing 727, as the sole passenger on a charter flight, being treated like the Very Important Person he truly is. Just like the rest of us.<br />And that, of course, is the secret: To live the James Bond Lifestyle is to have a rich and varied life, to learn from the mistakes you make, learn from the good experiences as well, and ultimately to live the good life.<br />Kyriazi is convinced (and therefore convincing) that anyone can &quot;be&quot; James Bond by adopting some rational thinking, planning, a committment to action, and ultimately action itself, into his (or her) life. Kyriazi throws out the cliches of &quot;self-improvement&quot; books and gives the reader truly practical and empirical advice for day to day living.<br />The central idea of &quot;How would Bond do it?&quot; is easily answered. He'd start by reading Paul Kyriazi's book.	2002-10-25

A children's retelling of the Jewish legend of Rabbi Judah Loew and the creature he created to save the Jews of Prague from destruction in 1580, the tale is simply and poignantly told, with lavish cut-paper illustrations in dynamic colors and shapes. This book is a Caldecott Medal Winner, and well-deservedly.<br />A word of caution, though---the illustrations can be dark and frightening for younger children, and the morality of the tale is complex and disturbing, even for adults.<br />For those who are not familiar with the legend, it concerns the \\"Blood Libel,\\" that fantastical tale that the Jews had used Christian blood in the baking of Passover matzohs, and Rabbi Loew's attempts to stave off a resultant pogrom (riot) in Prague by creating a Frankenstein's monster which \\"does it's work almost too well.\\" Upon saving the Jews, Rabbi Loew returns the Golem to the earth from which it came.<br />Sensitive and inquiring children (and adults) will be filled with questions, particularly as to why the Golem, who is both mindlessly, childishly destructive and sweetly childlike in his appreciation of flowers and sunsets, is rewarded by his creator with death after completing his appointed task.<br />These are saddening, unanswerable questions, but make GOLEM a true parable of human life. Children and parents may weep together over the injustices described here.<br />Definitely not for unsophisticated youngsters,or for adults faint of heart or spirit, this book should be shared and discussed at length and in depth.	2002-04-19

These tribes, the quintessential &quot;barbarians&quot; who sacked and then succeeded the Western Roman Empire, were an amalgam of Germanic and Slavic bloodlines, who ultimately ruled large sections of the former Empire, and most notably Iberia.<br />As Wolfram admits, &quot;A Goth was anyone who said he was,&quot; and the book suffers from the same lack of focus. Although attempts are made to discuss the social structure, culture, and history, military and otherwise, of the Goths, the discussions are superficial, rambling, and without point, and leave the reader feeling inconclusive. Wolfram seems fearful of drawing conclusions in this book, as if hypothesis or informed opinion might make him seem an irresponsible historian.<br />Who, after all, were these people, and why did they ravage Europe, and why were they so, finally, inestimably incapable of sustaining their identity? The book begs answers.<br />In part, the fault may be the writing style, which is textbook dry and lacks any sense (or attempt) at vividness. Wolfram's Goths are museum pieces, not a living, breathing community of people.<br />The scholarship of this work is exhaustive and astounding. Over half the book is comprised of Author's Notes and Bibliography. Certainly, if the reader has an abiding interest in Gothic history, this is a wonderful sourcebook for other, primary, materials.<br />Reading much more like a dissertation than a popular work of history, HISTORY OF THE GOTHS is a tedious and boring read, unless, like the author, you find these vanished people compellingly fascinating.	2002-03-18

There was no &quot;Celtic Empire&quot; as such, and no centralized Celtic authority, but this people, the aboriginal tribe of Europe, occupied the continent from its fringes in Iberia and Ireland all the way to central Anatolia. As such, they formed the foundation stock of the modern Irish, Welsh, Scottish, English, Bretons, French, Swiss, Austrians, Spanish and Portuguese, as well as contributing their bloodlines to the Italians, Balkan peoples, Turks, and even Germans and Slavs.<br />The Celts had an overwhelming cultural impact on the formation of modern Europe, but it is an impact which is shrouded, due to the Roman domination of the Celts around the time of Christ. Most European rivers have Celtic names (the Danube, the Don, the Dnieper, and the Donets are all named for the Celtic river-goddess Danu; and the Rhine and the Rhone both are named from the Celtic word for &quot;valley&quot;).<br />Unfortunately, the Celts abjured writing in favor of human memory, so that, as their cultural nexus dispersed so did their learning and lore. Hence, we know relatively little about these people, the ancestors of many of us of European background. What we do know is often distorted, or plain wrong, written by Greeks and Romans, the latter (particularly Caesar, in his &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;), setting out to deride the barbarians seen as only fit for conquest.<br />Ellis tries mightily to lift the veil in this book. He has a fine appreciation for his subject, and if he makes the error of sometimes casting his Celts as &quot;noble savages,&quot; replete with democratic thoughts and ways, he can be forgiven for doubting the Roman histories.<br />Given the relative lack of written primary source material, and the enigmatic messages of archaeological ruins, the book is necessarily too short, and reads as the quickest thousand-year history in print.

It fails to provide much in the way of depth or \\"color\\" in regard to the Jews who were such a vital part of Lithuanian history from it's beginnings.<br />Of particular note are the facts that Lithuanian Jewry had its roots in the slow dispersion of the Sephardim during the Reconquista of Iberia. It is instructive that in only two countries---Spain and Lithuania---were Jews permitted to be titled landholders. The author, Masha Greenbaum, fails to analyze these fascinating facts, or draw historical conclusions, of these, and many other elements, (though they are reported in passing), and thus fails to make an account of the earliest underpinnings of the community, or speak on its shared values as they developed.<br />There are better books on Lithuanian Jewish history, though this one is generally available, and is certainly readable. There are some historical errors which detract from the book's value as source material, but as a \\"starting point\\" for the investigation of Lithuanian Jewry, the book most definitely suffices.<br />For Jews tracing their families in Lithuania, the large number of localities named will be helpful, as will the discussion of the liquidation of those communities.<br />Given the vast scope of the subject, it is to be hoped that a better, more in-depth, and sensitive and sympathetic volume is in preparation somewhere.	2002-03-15

Buried deep inside each one of us, no matter how bald, how plump, how short, how ugly, or how sartorially tasteless, is a James Bond trying to get out.<br />DRESSED TO KILL explores the mystique of Bond in a tasteful coffee-table edition crammed full of rare photographs and enjoyable essays addressing the age old question of just what suits a man.<br />It wasn't until I read this book that I realized the profound cultural impact which the Bond movies had and have, and the deep and lasting impact they'd had on me, personally, and how they'd unconsciously formed the basis of my impressions of male style.<br />From the suited hero of the 40's, 50's and 60's (witness Cary Grant), to the styleless 70's (Roger Moore's mod Bond looks just a little ridiculous amongst the Jermyn Street of Connery and the Brioni of Brosnan), the suited antihero of the 80's (and his doppleganger the antisuited hero of the \\"Die Hard\\" and Indiana Jones ilk), into the 90's and the new millennium, this ultimately enjoyable book is a paean to the way we all want to look.

LAMMAS NIGHT is one of the most original and interesting treatments of World War Two-era fiction ever to be penned. Like many another reader, I came across Sir John Cathal Graham while reading the ADEPT series, and wondered why he didn't rate his own series. I still wonder why he is the central character in only this one book, because Gray Graham is fascinating and complex, far more multidimensional than the too-well-turned-out Sir Adam Sinclair, and capable of so much more literary development. This is one of my favorite books.<br />Kurtz's writing is crisp, detailed, fast-paced, informative and even educational without being dry. The book could serve as a primer on practices of the Old Religion, which it portrays in a sensitive and sympathetic light. LAMMAS NIGHT includes a spirited discussion of reincarnation theories and comparative religion, written with subtlety and creativity. There are no lectures in the book, just presentations fitting seamlessly into the telling of the tale. There are no magical pyrotechnics here, just psychological drama, good taut storytelling, a compelling plot, and a sense of historical place and time that is undeniably alluring. Hardly the stuff of &quot;Sword and Sorcery&quot; or &quot;fantasy,&quot; writing, this novel could easily be classed with Ludlum, LeCarre, Forsyth, and Follett as an espionage thriller par excellence. This may be Ms. Kurtz's finest book.	2002-02-09

This book is a tedious listing of (mostly negative) events. It lacks any sparkle and vigor, and if I believed half of it, I'd have to wonder just what the appeal of this group of overgrown adolescents could be. There had to be more.<br /><br />The Chairman of The Board is the centerpiece as an egomaniacal bully who uses his star power to make the world feel indebted to him. His reported temper tantrums seem utterly absurd. Anyone who used his fists or threats of mob violence as much as the authors claim Sinatra did, should have and would have been locked up, \\"different era\\" or no. The Frank Sinatra in these pages wouldn't be a \\"King of Cool\\". He wouldn't be anything much.<br /><br />The rest of the boys orbit around Frank like some kind of an inebriated solar system. The boozing and skirt-chasing is leaden, so where's the thrill? Where are the laughs? If this book is at all accurate (and it isn't, listing Dean Martin's date of death incorrectly), it means that this group of supremely talented entertainers valued nothing, not even themselves.<br /><br />The bulk of the book is made up of mostly scathing summaries of the Rat Pack movies. Nary a word is said about either Frank or Dean's musical careers. Sammy Davis Jr. is dismissed as little more than the Rat Pack houseboy. Peter Lawford is depicted as a sexually confused drug addict craving the attention of the others. Joey Bishop is virtually forgotten. The Rat Pack Mascots (Shirley MacLaine and Angie Dickinson) get barely honorable mentions (MacLaine far more than Dickinson). One has to wonder why Shirley MacLaine would continue to associate with The Rat Pack after being assaulted by mobster Sam Giancana twice in their company. The book begs an answer. MacLaine is no slouch, so obviously more and better was happening with the \\"Clan\\" than this sordid book deigns to tell us.<br /><br />To really appreciate the Rat Pack give a listen to [[ASIN:B00005RGHW The Rat Pack Live at the Sands]] or [[ASIN:B0000CF342 The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin (CD & DVD)]].ASIN:B00005RGHW The Rat Pack Live at the Sands]] or [[ASIN:B0000CF342 The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live & Swingin (CD & DVD)]].	2002-01-28

As a matter of fact, as I flipped through the book, I remembered having (or having played with) many more of these wonderful toys than I originally thought. It wasn't until I worked my way through SPY TOYS that I realized how profound the impact of the Secret Agent was on my young years.<br />Burks lists virtually every Secret Agent related toy in general distribution in the 60s. James Bond 007, of course, is the centerpiece of the book, but Burks also covers THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E, SECRET AGENT, I SPY, HONEY WEST, GET SMART, and others. He misses a few (I remember cheap \\"Agent 707\\" knock-offs that were fun additions to our playing James Bond), but not many.<br />Had I realized how valuable some of these collectibles are, I never would have tossed them away. When moving house (as an adult) I threw away a Sean Connery Bond hand puppet in fine condition which Burks lists at [amt] value. Never mind the price, the nostalgia is worth more. And Burks and I share a passion for the \\"coolest toy we ever owned,\\" the original Bond briefcase, now valued mint at [amt].  Go find one.<br />The shortcoming of SPY TOYS is that Burks only lists \\"Mint\\" values, and also fails to give the beginning collector even a hint of where to go to find Spy toys in the world. A lesser failing of the book is that most items have very little commentary attached to them, so the \\"Why\\" of valuation is generally missing.<br />One of the most fun things about the book is the reprints of the Montgomery Ward and Sears Christmas catalogue pages, showing prices. A complex and detailed toy like the James Bond briefcase (the quality of this toy was outstanding right down to the molded leather graining on the outside of the plastic case; it had codebooks, a code machine, business cards, a wallet with play money that looked very real, \\"explosive\\" combination locks, a multi-part firing gun, hidden rubber throwing knife, plastic bullets, and more), retailed for well under [amt]. A toy like that today (assuming the morality and litigation police would allow the making of a toy that could shoot, stab, and blow things up) would be at least [amt].<br />It's a different world, but with SPY TOYS we can at least visit our innocence and relive our childhood fun.code machine, business cards, a wallet with play money that looked very real, \\"explosive\\" combination locks, a multi-part firing gun, hidden rubber throwing knife, plastic bullets, and more), retailed for well under [amt].

The glimpse is not reassuring. Political infighting and bad communications hamper the fight against Ebola, just as with AIDS. Considering that the effect of Ebola is to turn a human being into a highly infectious, bloody soup the turf battles of the virus hunters seem inexcusable.<br />It's clear that an airborne strain of Ebola could decimate the human race in a matter of weeks. There is no telling when (or if) such a strain might develop with just a slight mutation of any one of Ebola's seven proteins. Given that risk, the politics seem puerile.<br />The book is readable and does not lose itself in technojargon, relying instead on the humanization of its subjects, researchers and victims alike.<br />I definitely recommend this as an expose on medical bureaucracy, governmental ineptitude, and risk, though coming away with the knowledge that we are all living in THE HOT ZONE is anything but comforting.	2001-08-22

Frederick Forsyth, Ken Follett and Robert Ludlum all together couldn't think up a story as amazing as this one.  THE HOUSE ON GARIBALDI STREET is called a \\"Classic of Espionage\\" and it is. Isser Harel, the Chief of the Israeli Secret Services recounts in detail the amazing capture of Adolf Eichmann, \\"The Man In The Glass Booth\\" who was Hitler's senior functionary in creating and carrying out the \\"Final Solution\\" and one of the prime creators of the Holocaust.<br />Eichmann, whose policies and personal behavior condemned six million human beings to death, was captured by Israeli agents, tried in a Court of law, and executed---the only person ever put to death by Judicial process in Israel.  Hiding in Argentina under an assumed name, he was eventually caught through a combination of complacency (his family began to use their real name), bizarre coincidence (a neighborhood blind man acted as the informant after his daughter dated Eichmann's son), luck (Eichmann never caught on that he had been discovered), and incredibly hard work (the Israelis painstakingly traced him and tracked him down).<br />This is true espionage, so real it reads like a novel. Far and away the most taut tale ever written---because it's true.	2001-08-15

At that time I was very impressed with most of what I heard. Despite the \\"James Bond\\" metaphor, Paul Kyriazi steered sharply away from the cheap and superficial womanizing, drinking, gambling and fighting elements of the Bond universe to draw out the best side of the character. Although some of Mr. Kyriazi's specific advice was not applicable to my own lifestyle, or even my imagined James Bond Lifestyle, I could see where Mr. Kyriazi was going with this idea, and overall, HOW TO LIVE THE JAMES BOND LIFESTYLE was a very positive condensed self-improvement course. The eponymous book that followed only expanded on the tape.<br /><br />Now he has re-released HOW TO LIVE THE JAMES BOND LIFESTYLE on eight full-length CDs, and expanded on both the tape and the book. With each iteration of the course, Mr. Kyriazi gets further away from being intensely focused on the character of Bond and closer to being intensely focused on the individual seminar participant's character. Perhaps Mr. Kyriazi's residing in Japan is having a subtle effect: With his continuing reminders to stay focused and live mindfully, HOW TO LIVE THE JAMES BOND LIFESTYLE has taken on a very spare, elegant, and Zen-like flavor, spiced in places with instruction of how to game (not gamble) in Las Vegas, and how to find and fall for your own Bond Girl (no sexy cyphers these, but exciting, enjoyable and intelligent women you will want to spend time with, and who will want to spend time with you).<br /><br />This daylong course is capped with a meditation technique (formerly, HOW TO CLEAR THE SUBCONSCIOUS FOR 00 AGENTS, previously available as a separate tape, now expanded as well).<br /><br />Never really a course on \\"How To Pretend To Be A Cinematic Secret Agent,\\" HOW TO LIVE THE JAMES BOND LIFESTYLE has now developed to the point where it could really teach James Bond a thing or two.

Refusing  to accept the limitations of her life, she flees her home village and  travels with Kazakh the Scythian.  While in his company, she demonstrates  psychic abilities allowing her to tame and communicate with animals,  particularly the horses of the Scythians (a tribe who are generally  considered to have domesticated the horse some 5,000-8,000 years  ago).<br />When her &quot;magical&quot; abilities become manifest, she is  pursued by the shaman Kernunnos of her own tribe, who wishes to force her  to return home. Kernunnos is obsessed with using Epona's powers to best  benefit her own tribe. (The mythological Kernunnos was the Celtic god of  the hunt, and here, his fictional namesake follows Epona from the  modern-day Austria to the modern-day Ukraine.)<br />Ms. Llywelyn's writing is  crisp, detailed, and shows a fine appreciation for and understanding of the  symbolical universe which her characters inhabit.  The book brings these  almost-forgotten myths to life, and leaves the reader just about convinced  that perhaps it really did happen this way.	2000-09-06

As a boy not much younger than Graham himself I was captivated by his story, by his  daring in taking a 24-foot sloop across trackless oceans, by his exotic  ports of call, and by the romance which fueled his ambition.<br />Robin Lee  Graham was like a lot of baby boomers, but when he dropped out at age 16,  he dropped into exotic places like Fanning Island, Papeetee, and the Indian  Ocean.  More travelogue than sailing guide, DOVE gave it's readers glimpses  of places rarely visited and virtually unknown at the time. Thirty years  later in the Internet and Cellular World it's hard to picture just how  far-flung Graham's travels really were.  Graham sailed three-quarters of  the way around the world without a 2-way radio, and without SatNav, GPS,  Loran, EPIRB, or even a real life raft, in a boat barely bigger than a  bedroom. He finished the trip in a slightly larger, better equipped  boat.<br />Graham was a reluctant sailor who was happiest ashore with his  wife, Patti (who he met along the way in Fiji). Revisiting DOVE, I found  that Graham felt overly pressured (by his father and by NATIONAL  GEOGRAPHIC, both of which were financing the trip) to complete the  circumnavigation. His strongest motivation to sail on was his wife, who  played global hopscotch to stay always one port of call in the future. His  best reminiscences always include her.<br />Graham closed the circle, but I  had to wonder if he would not have been happier, like Moitessier, just to  sail off into the sunset and find his own way.	2000-07-12

The Jews of Spain and Portugal made formative contributions to all Hispanic cultures, the impact of which is first being measured and recognized today.<br />The Sephardim experienced a Golden Age in Iberia  between 900-1100, during which they acted as the intermediaries between the  rival political and cultural worlds of Islam and Christianity. This Golden  Age ended with the Reconquest of Spain by Catholic overlords, though for  another 300 years the Jews continued to contribute to Iberian life.  In  1391 and again in 1492, intense and violent social pressures were put upon  the Jews to join the larger Christian community.  Many Jews converted,  often unwillingly.  In 1492 the remaining Jews were exiled from  Spain.<br />The converted Jews (Conversos) became an underclass in Spanish  society. Many of them clung tenaciously to Jewish practices in the face of  torture and death at the hands of the Inquisition. Having lost contact with  other Jews, these people developed a religion which was an admixture of  Catholic and Jewish rituals.  David Gitlitz examines these practices in  detail and attempts to answer the question of whether the Conversos were in  fact Jewish.<br />Gitlitz's research is exhaustive. He has combed through  thousands of Inquistion records, showing that a sense of  &quot;Jewishness&quot; if not Jewish practice remained a core value of many  Spaniards' lives well into the 1700s. Gitlitz is convincing in showing that  the Inquisition unwittingly aided crypto-Jews in perpetuating themselves by  publishing Edicts of Faith.  Essentially checklists for informers, they  described the behavior of &quot;Judaizers&quot; (sometimes the practices  listed were absurd or simply erroneous). These, ironically, were used by  Judaizers as guides to religious behavior. It is revealing that as the  Inquisition faded, crypto-Judaism waned, though never totally  vanished.<br />Gitlitz's knowledge and research on the subject is  encyclopedic. The book is written in a  &quot;textbook&quot; style which  makes it somewhat technical and dry, though it is enlivened by excerpts  from Inquisition records, which Gitlitz has apparently chosen for their  interest, irony, unintended comedy, or spiritedness.<br />It is difficult to  imagine that human beings would face the tortures of the rack for not  eating pork. That these same tortured people could summon the will to laugh  at their executioners is something wondrous.<br />Whether they were  &quot;Christians,&quot; &quot;Jews,&quot; or both or neither, SECRECY AND  DECEIT is a testament to their spirit.ledge and research on the subject is  encyclopedic.

At the age of 20, he was already  one of the major writers and thinkers on subjects such as Zen Buddhism and  Taoism. He was a major exponent of the Zen outlook of Thou Art That.<br />Watts, an unfrocked Episcopal priest, has often been derided  (wrongfully) as a 'popularizer' of subjects more properly reserved for  serious study and practice, and (more rightly) as sometimes glib and  definitely irreverent. This book is a record of Watts' indulgence in the  pleasures of the flesh with a high spiritual purpose.<br />Watts wrote  more than 20 books, and this is Watts at his irreverent best. Written with  his tongue firmly jammed into his cheek, it is a compendium of a lifetime's  worth of exuberant fun and learning for the joy of it.<br />Watts gleefully  recounts tales of spiritual masters with stomachaches, hidebound bishops  drinking fine wines, and sexy women discovering their Buddha-nature.<br />Nothing is too minor or too major for Watts's wit, and his reminiscences  carry us from the bathroom of his childhood home in England to Canterbury  Cathedral, from New York City to Big Sur, and touch on almost every major  and many minor figures of the 1950s and 1960s.<br />Watts unabashedly tells  us that he finds his life intensely interesting.

One cannot  &quot;enjoy&quot; this book; like MEIN KAMPF, one reads it for its  historical importance. This book should form a part of every thinking  person's library as a warning beacon, if for no other reason that it is a  seminal textbook on the inhumanity of humanity.<br />First written in 1484  by the Friars Kramer and Sprenger, (and reprinted endlessly), the MALLEUS  was immediately given the imprimatur of the Holy See as the most important  work on witchcraft, to date.  And so it remains.<br />The MALLEUS  MALEFICARUM is a compendium of fifteenth century paranoias, all the more  frightening for its totalitarian modernity. (&quot;Anything that is done  for the benefit of the State is Good.&quot;) In form, it is a &quot;how  to&quot; guide on recognizing, capturing, torturing, and executing witches.  In substance, it is a diatribe against women, heretics, independent  thinkers, romantic lovers, the sensitive passions,  human sexuality, and  compassion.<br />&quot;Vanity of vanities&quot; indeed. In writing the  MALLEUS, Kramer and Spenger claimed to be doing &quot;God's work&quot;;  these men, and those who followed them worshiped only their own arrogance.  Read it and Be Afraid, my friends.<br />Forming a portion of every working law  library for 300 years, there is no estimate of how many women and men were  put to death through the mechanism of this benighted book. Some historians  estimate that the numbers may run into the millions.<br />The text is rife  with &quot;caselaw&quot; examples of witchcraft, some of which are clearly  delusional and some downright silly, or would be, if they hadn't ended in  gruesome deaths for the accused. Take the case of the poor woman who was  burned for offering the opinion that &quot;it might rain today&quot;  shortly before it did.<br />Of note are Kramer and Spenger's assertions that  prosecutors are (conveniently) &quot;immune&quot; to witchcraft, and their  instructions to Judges to tell the truth to the witch that there will be  mercy shown (with the mental reservation that death is a mercy to those  prisoner to the devil).  Such twisted logic is the cornerstone of the  MALLEUS.<br />The translator, Rev. Montague Summers, waxes rhapsodic on the  &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot; of the authors of the MALLEUS.  He was apparently of a mind with Kramer and Spenger, and wrote two  embarrassingly effusive and bigoted introductions (in 1928 and 1946),  praising the &quot;brillance&quot; of this work and its importance in this  &quot;feministic&quot; era.<br />Summers' commentary is as frightening as  anything Kramer and Spenger wrote in the text proper, the more so for being  20th century, and particularly post-World War Two. Like the Papal Bull of  VIII which is now considered integral with the MALLEUS, future commentators  will make much of the statements of Summers, a &quot;modern&quot; man.<br />In short, the MALLEUS MALEFICARUM was a license to kill. And it was used  far too often and far too freely.<br />Kramer and Spenger's madness did not  die with them; but how many have died with their madness?and their  instructions to Judges to tell the truth to the witch that there will be  mercy shown (with the mental reservation that death is a mercy to those  prisoner to the devil).

It is the story of Ainvar (\\"He  Who Travels Far\\"), a young apprentice Druid in pre-Roman Gaul (France)  who is sent, true to his name, to the far corners of his country to report  on the growing menace of Julius Caesar and his legions.<br /><br />Ms. Llywelyn is  a Celtic scholar, and paints a masterful portrait of life among the  European Celts, the aboriginal people of Europe, whose contributions to  world history are, sadly enough, little known. While much of Ms. Llywelyn's  storycraft is necessarily invention, it does have the powerful ring of  truth, and her gifted weaving of historical personages such as Caesar and  Vercingetorix, the king of the Gauls, into this true to life and very  detailed story of an advanced and settled culture on the verge of  cataclysmic change, only underscores what was lost when  \\"civilization\\" reached the \\"barbarians\\" of Europe.<br /><br />DRUIDS is a pleasure to read. It reads more like an actual memoir than  fiction, and is written with humor, sensitivity, and pathos. DRUIDS sheds  light on a little-known portion of history, and for those of us  dissatisfied with the \\"official\\" brand of history sold to us in  most books, DRUIDS is a refreshing and very successful tale of the meeting  of cultures, and the rise and fall of civilizations, told from the  perspective of one observant but imperfect human being.	1999-08-10
