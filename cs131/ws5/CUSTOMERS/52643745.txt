This book and Damerow's other book, \\"The Chicken Health Handbook\\" are the two I recommend to new chicken owners. This book focuses on getting you started, and includes the following chapters:<br /><br /> 1. Choosing the Perfect Chicken<br /><br /> 2. Housing<br /><br /> 3. Feeding<br /><br /> 4. Meat Bird Management<br /><br /> 5. Butchering Day (and Good Eating to Follow)<br /><br /> 6. Layer Management<br /><br /> 7. Table Eggs<br /><br /> 8. Managing Breeders<br /><br /> 9. Incubation and Hatching<br /><br /> 10. Chicken Care<br /><br /> 11. General Management<br /><br /> 12. Health Management<br /><br /> 13. Showing<br /><br />  Glossary<br /><br />  State Resources<br /><br />  Organizations<br /><br />  Recommended Reading<br /><br />  Videos<br /><br />  Suppliers<br /><br />  Index<br /><br />The only quibble I have with this book is that Damerow includes very little on how to effectively treat a sick chicken, other than culling it. This can be unsettling to the novice poultry owner, who is not always ready to cull those birds that are pets. That's why I like to recommend also purchasing her other book on health (see above.) It is a much more exhaustive reference with symptoms and treatments for various illnesses (chickens, unfortunately, are susceptible to a large number of ailments.)<br /><br />But all in all this is a very good book for the beginning fancier, and well worth the purchase.	2005-06-13

It's a serious textbook for those who are studying avian genetics. It is not for the faint of heart, or those without a background in basic genetic terms and science. All that being said, it's an invaluable book if you're seeking to understand how chicken genetics work, and apply them to your breeding processes.<br /><br />Chapters in this book include:<br /><br /> 1. The history and evolution of the domestic fowl<br /><br /> 2. The cellular organisation of genetic material<br /><br /> 3. The transmission of inherited characters<br /><br /> 4. Sex determination and sex-linked inheritance in the domestic fowl<br /><br /> 5. Linkage and chromosome mapping<br /><br /> 6. Genes controlling feathering and plumage color<br /><br /> 7. Muscle, nerve, and skeleton<br /><br /> 8. Lethal genes in domestic fowl<br /><br /> 9. Quantitative genetics<br /><br /> 10. Protein evolution and polymorphism<br /><br /> 11. Immunogenetics of the domestic fowl<br /><br /> 12. Gene cloning, sequencing and transfer in the domestic fowl<br /><br />There are also five appendices, a glossary, and an index. The appendices include:<br /><br /> I. Linage groups and the chromosome map in the domestic fowl<br /><br /> II. Oncogenes<br /><br /> III. The Chi squared test<br /><br /> IV. One letter amino acid code<br /><br /> V. The genetic code<br /><br />All in all this book is more then the average fancier would want to spend, but if you are a scientist or high-end hobbyist desiring to expand your knowledge of poultry genetics, then go for it!	2005-05-18

This book continues in the excellent Atevi/Humanity series which has been wonderfully explored by Cherryh. As the beginning in a new trilogy, it does have to take some time to both remind us of what has passed before, as well as set up what is to come. Despite that there is much to recommend this book (although I do suggest readers not familiar with the series read the previous six prior to this.)<br /><br />Cherryh's characterization, as always, is superb. Her books are complex and nuanced, and reflect the way real life is, a series of greys, not just blacks and whites. Her action is believable and carries the reader on to more contemplative spots. She continually allows us to explore with her the interaction between human and \\"alien\\" minds, values, and hard-wired responses to situations. I look forward to reading the rest in the series, and recommend this book to any fan of her work.	2005-05-16

This is the first book I turn to when I have a question regarding the health of my chickens. I breed purebred bantams and large fowl, (as well as ducks, guineas, and geese.) Damerow's book has just about everything you need to know when it comes to keeping your birds healthy, or dealing with it when they're sick.<br /><br />Her chapters include:<br /><br />  - Chicken Health<br /><br />  - Health and Nutrition<br /><br />  - Anatomy of a Chicken<br /><br />  - External Parasites<br /><br />  - Internal Parasites: Worms<br /><br />  - Internal Parasites: Protozoa<br /><br />  - Infectious Diseases<br /><br />  - Environment Related Problems<br /><br />  - Diagnostic Guides<br /><br />  - Postmortem Examination<br /><br />  - Therapy<br /><br />  - Enhancing Immunity<br /><br />  - Incubation and Brooding<br /><br />  - Chickens and Human Health<br /><br />  - Diseases and Disorders<br /><br />She also includes a glossary, a list of suppliers, state poultry laboratories, and a list of recommended reading material.<br /><br />If you own chickens, and care about their health, you owe it to yourself and them to get this book.

It is not one I'd recommend for someone just getting into goats. But if you're really serious about your caprines, this book is a must-have.<br />The topics covered include: Control and Housing of Goats; Principles and Practice of Feeding; Selection of Breeding Stock; Breeding Problems; Disease and Accident; Milking and Dairy Produce; Meat, Leather, and Fleece; Goat Farming Systems; Crops for Goats; Goats for Export; Harness Goats; and more.<br />There is a thorough index, a bibliography, and several appendixes. The info is presented in a rather dry manner, but is very useful. There are lots of great diagrams, charts, and pictures. It's just a ton of good information. The only major fault I can find is that being published in Great Britain, it does use some terminology unfamiliar to most Americans, and doesn't deal with the US at all. But that's ok, we have enough other books which cover those topics.<br />Bottom line, if you're looking for a really good, technical reference book on goats of all types, this is an important one to add to your library.	2002-10-23

I really like this book. I have been involved with goats for the past two years, and have been lucky enough to keep my herd with a friend who has been &quot;doing&quot; goats for more than ten years. As I read through this book it covers all of the major topics that a novice needs to know about, and presents the information in an easy-to-read format.<br />The book covers the following topics: Basic Information About Goats; Milk; Getting Your Goat; Housing; Fencing; Feeding; Grooming; Health; The Buck; Breeding; Kidding; Raising Kids; Milking; Keeping Records; Chevon; Dairy Products; and Recipes for Goat Products. It has an thorough appendix, a good glossary, and an extensive index.<br />All in all I highly recommend this book for someone considering purchasing dairy goats, as well as those who already have goats and want a good reference book to which they can refer as needed. Don't hesitate, buy it!	2002-09-22

Some of the other reviewers of this book found it hilarious, I did not. It was interesting to read, offered some good insights on things to do and things to avoid before moving to the country, but it just wasn't all that funny, really. In fact, I found some parts of it to be just too much gloom and doom!<br />I don't live in the country now (although I'd like to) but I do own livestock, which I board with friends who have a farm. And based on my experiences on my friends farm, this book focuses too much on the bad things that can happen, and not enough on how many wonderful things can occur when you live in the country.<br />Mind you, these folks go head over heels. It's not necessary to move so far out of town that you're off the grid in order to own livestock and live a country life. One doesn't have to grow or raise all of one's food, it is possible to live in the country and still go to the store in town on a regular basis (bad weather or no.) All in all this is an ok book, but not as lighthearted as the other reviewers seem to think.	2002-08-28

I have been riding horses on and off for almost all of my adult life (my grandfather plopped me on my first horse when I was three.) Yet it was only recently that I learned how to use the Join Up technique that Monty Roberts created, and I have to say it's been one of the most incredible things I've ever done with a horse.<br />This book has two parts. The first is the story of Monty's life, and it's a simply amazing one. He takes us through his childhood as a rodeo star, to his work as a trainer, and his ongoing search to learn to communicate more effectively with horses (and other animals.) The techniques he has developed are ground-breaking, and if for no other reason than to learn how to Join Up with your own horse, I'd advise you to buy this book. But the stories are fascinating, moving, and inspiring, and the book could sell with even without the Join Up technique.<br />All in all this is a book that every horse owner should read, at least once. And using the Join Up technique with your horse will forever change the way you relate to horses. Try it, you'll be amazed at the results!	2002-07-07

My family owns one of the cottages in the area this author writes about, and I've been going to Nags Head since I was just a few months old. Rountree accurately captures the flavor and feeling of the area as I remember it, and as my grandparents remembered it (my grandfather first went to Nags Head in the 1930s.)<br />The book is filled with many black and white photos from as early as 1900, and has interviews with many of the locals whose families were among the earliest settlers along the beach. There are stories told of names like the Midgett family, Rev. Drane, the Nixons, Ras Wescott, the Buchanans, the Rascoes, Carolista Baum, and of course, the cottage builder S.J. Twine.<br />This book would be a pleasure to own for any who remember the &quot;good old days&quot;, when families traipsed down the sand from one cottage to another for a cocktail party every night; when mothers would come to the beach with the kids for the whole summer and fathers joined them on weekends; when Harris's grocery store was the best (and only!) place to buy your freshly ground hamburger; dancing at the Casino; driving Jeeps on Jockey's Ridge; pig picks and clambakes on the beach; the days before Nags Head was quite so filled with tourists and more populated by summer people. It's a real trip down memory lane, and I recommend it highly.	2001-07-26

This reference book on goats is not the best I've seen, but has some very nice points to it. It is out of date in several areas, the most important being the issue of mineral supplementation (the problem with copper being the most glaring.) But that info can be found in other places, like newslists on the Internet and so on.<br />The book is smaller than most, with only 93 pages, but has some very nice illustrations and photos. The topics covered include: Buying Goats; Housing and Equipment; Feeding; Care and Management; Health Maintenance and Sickness; Breeding and Raising Young; Goat Products; and Goat Breeds of the World.<br />All in all this is an ok book, but should not be the primary resource for someone entering into raising goats.	2001-06-10

I am new to raising goats, and found this reference book to be extremely useful. My Alpines are in a herd with the woman who boards my horses, so I am not completely on my own, but having this book allowed me to expand my knowledge without having to email my friend every two minutes with another question!<br />Luttermann's book covers pretty much everything a goat keeper needs to know about dairy goats, although having been published in 1986 it might be a little out of date with regards to supplementation of various minerals such as copper. However one can find that info in other places, and its lack does not negate the value of this book.<br />Bottom line, if you're getting into goats, you should buy this book!	2001-06-10

My husband bought me this journal for my birthday and I am quite pleased by it. It is a smaller hardbound book with the lovely photos by Gabrielle Boiselle that GaWaNi Pony Boy has used in his other books. There are lots of lined pages sprinkled with questions from Pony to jog your thoughts and provide a springboard for your writing. There is plenty of room to write comments and then come back and revisit your thinking later. It's a lavish yet practical book which can be taken to the barn and then brought home again to fill with your observations. It makes a wonderful gift for any horse lover.	2001-06-10
US	52643745	R3P649JN1UWS7S	0743211383	241269653	Dreamcatcher	Books	5	1	3	N	Y	Another wonderful effort from this great author...	I have been a fan of King's work for many years, and found this latest effort from him did not disappoint. I finished it yesterday, and it's still lingering in my head, as good writing often does. King has the rare ability to take a reader into the plot of his work so that we feel we are a part of the story, and the real world falls away around us as we read. This novel shows how King is maturing as a writer, while still providing fans with the things they love.<br />It's the story of four boyhood friends, and a fifth friend who binds them together for life, and into death as well. King speaks so well to the masculine soul, it's always a bit of a guilty pleasure to see into the minds of the men he presents to us, as in many ways they are &quot;everyman&quot; with their typical male behavior. These four men begin their adventure with a hunting trip out in the woods of Maine, but a routine male bonding weekend it's not, once the spaceship full of an alien fungus known as the &quot;byrus&quot; crash lands into the woods. The plot, a bit meditative at first, ramps into full blown military response at this point, and all hell breaks loose in northern Maine. But through the twists and turns of fate and time, through the simple love of a boyhood friend, and the shining strength of the human spirit, the world is literally saved from a fate worse than death.<br />It's a lovely story. King likes to make us think a bit now, as he's getting older and feeling his mortality a little. In the past he was content to have us react, now we need to think about why we are reacting, and how. And I like that a lot. Anyone who fluffs King off as not being a serious writer obviously hasn't read his work lately. All in all this is an excellent effort from one of my all-time favorite authors, and I recommend it highly. Don't hesitate, buy it!	2001-03-25

I am not a Biblical scholar, and did not chose to read this book because it was the &quot;story&quot; of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. I was drawn to this book more for the way it took a minor character from the bible and used her as a pivot to write a thoroughly engrossing story about the lives of women during the time presented in the Book of Genesis.<br />In this book we follow Dinah as she grows up, entering early the company of women due to her being the only daughter of her mother and aunts (all married to the same man.) We watch as she is initiated into the mysteries of womanhood; menstruation, childbirth, relating to men. With the &quot;red tent&quot; as their center, this society of sisters and other women is revealed as the complex and powerful entity that it is, as the women who make it up struggle with using their power within a male dominated society.<br />This is not a feminist book, per se, but it does examine some feminist issues. Mostly though, I just found it an engrossing read, and was drawn into caring about the protagonist and her life and troubles. All in all this is a wonderful book for anyone, man or woman, from any religious background, although I think it will resonate more for women than it will for men.	2001-03-09

This book is a nice place for first and second graders to start when they need to look up a word. It has 650 color illustrations (drawings and photographs), 1,800 entries, and pretty well covers the beginning words used by young readers. Each entry has a definition, as well as uses the word in a sentence to give context. If there is more than one definition, they are numbered in order of common usage. Variant forms of the word are listed at the end of the definition. The illustrations are bright and cute, and the type is large enough to facilitate easy reading.<br />My only real quibble with this book is that there is no pronunciation guide given for words. I realize youngsters might not be able to use such a guide all the time, but it would be good to have anyway. All in all a nice book for the 5-7 age range, but if you're looking for older kids, look elsewhere.	2001-03-09

It has a whole lot of interesting and compelling information. It's full of great illustrations; photos of icons, pottery, paintings and so on. It has history of goddess figures from all over the world. But it's laid out so poorly that it's really hard to read, and discourages the reader from doing research.<br />The book covers a variety of goddess myths and worship histories, from places as varied as India, Australia, Egypt, Britain, Rome, Greece, and more. It speaks to the various faces of the goddess, from warrior to healer, from creator to destroyer. It has a nice glossary and a thorough index. But sadly, whoever typeset this book did such a poor job that I was put off from reading it. The main topics are constantly interrupted by sidebars about this or that. The type is often placed on colored backgrounds, making it difficult to read. The topics aren't organized well, so here's no comfortable way to sit and read the whole book through.<br />All is all this could be a great book if it were re-edited so as to make it much more readable than it is now. The information it contains is good; it's just too hard to squeeze out of the mess made when the book was put together.	2001-03-08

It's a large coffee table book, yet at the same time it's a handy reference (almost a field guide) to the whales of the world. It has over 200 pages of information and hundreds of color photographs of whales from all over the planet. The whales are broken down into types: Baleen versus Toothed, and then each type is covered by species. Included are: Baleen whales; Rorqual whales; the Gray whale; Right Whales; Sperm whales; Beaked and Bottlenose whales; Oceanic Dolphins; Beluga and Narwhal; Freshwater Dolphins; and Porpoises.<br />The introduction has lots of important information about whales, and a number of diagrams showing some of the differences between whales. I liked best the chart that shows the relative size of the various whales in relation to one another. This is followed by pages of information on each individual type of whale, showing a photo (if available), a diagram, and containing information about the whale.<br />All in all this is a great book if you're interested in these wonderful creatures, and it helps to differentiate between the various types. It's worth looking for even though it's out of print.	2001-03-08

This book is not perfect, but it is a good place to start if you're looking for a book which is well structured and don't mind the fact that there are no tapes or CDs. I took French for four years in high school, so I cannot really comment on how effective it is for persons who've never taken French at all. But I did find it very useful as a refresher course and for looking up grammatical rules and general info.<br />There are six overall sections, broken down into various chapters. They are: The Very Basics; Travel; Fun and Games; Problems; Let's Get Down to Business; and the Answer Key. Each section proceeds in a logical fashion, and there are often sidebars such as &quot;Pitfalls&quot;, &quot;As a Rule&quot;, and &quot;Cultural Tidbits.&quot; These help break things up and keep it interesting while you're slogging along through a series of verbs or lists of items. There are often pronunciation guides for words, which are surprisingly useful, and there are sample sentences for common usage and everyday situations.<br />All in all this book is a good value for the price and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.	2001-03-07

The guide includes information on the following topics: Artist Signed; Unsigned Artists; Advertising; Real Life; Real Photos; Sports; Entertainers; Topicals; Social History; and Lynchings.<br />All in all this book is a must-have for any serious postcard collector or dealer.

This is a nice, useful book. It's short, with only sixty pages, but it does manage to pack a fair amount of info in there, and include some very nice fondue recipes (how many fondue recipes are out there, anyway?) It focuses more on dinner, rather than dessert fondues, but has a wide variety of styles, so there should be a recipe for every taste here.<br />Szwillus uses five main categories: Cheese fondues; Oil fondues; Stock fondues; International fondues; and Side dishes and sweet fondues. She includes a recipe table, which shows a list of the various recipes and whether they are easy or hard, can be made fast or take more time, lists calories per serving, and other criteria by which to pick a specific one. There is also an index that makes it easy to find what you're looking for if you have something specific in mind.

I really like this book, and so does my trainer (in fact, I'm giving it to her for her birthday!) Strictly speaking, it's almost more of a manual than a book. As the title indicates, it contains 101 exercises for you to use in an arena with your horse. All the exercises shown are maneuvers to be done while mounted, none are in-hand work. Most work with either English or Western styles of riding, although some are slanted more one way than another. Dressage enthusiasts will recognize much of the work here, as will some of the Western specialists.<br />There are five main sections in the book: Gaits; Transitions; Circles; Lateral Work; and Mini-Patterns. Each exercise covers two pages, with an overhead diagram showing the pattern created in the arena, as well as a drawing showing the desired effect in the horse. Each page has a step-by-step description of how to ride the exercise, a list of benefits, cautions to consider while doing it, and occasionally, extra notes. All the illustrations are pen and ink drawings; there are no photographs.<br />Some of the exercises are a little the same, I will agree with a previous reviewer on that point. But all are worth working on and getting right. The format of the book encourages you to take it to the arena with you, with a spiral binding that allows the pages to lay flat. The only thing I'd like to see is to have the pages all laminated, but that surely would have increased the cost, so I'll live with it the way it is. All in all this book is well worth owning, whether you're an Dressage rider, barrel racer, or simply a riding enthusiast who wants to increase the skill set of themselves and their horse. Don't hesitate to buy it, it's well worth the price.	2001-03-03

I found this book to have useful information for a beginner, but the manner in which it is presented made it hard to access and use. The format Galloway uses includes an ongoing story that tells of a group of runners and their quest to run a marathon, broken up into parts in each chapter. The story was too precious for me, I found it distracted from the information I was looking for, and made it hard to wade through the book.<br />I would have been much better served by a less cute, more cut and dried manual, using the info Galloway presents, but without the stories. There are some good techniques in here, some interesting points, some valuable tips. But the effort required to extract the good info out of the rest of the mush was too much, and I felt it detracted from the overall value of the book.	2001-03-03

I bought this book in anticipation of going to the Keys, but have not done so yet, so I cannot comment on the actual accuracy of her information. But I can say this is one of the more refreshing tour guides I've ever read. Williams' writing style is clear and to the point. She gives a great deal of historical background to each region, as well as the more usual &quot;best hotels, best restaurant&quot; info you'd expect. There is a fair amount of emphasis on the various forms of wildlife found in the area, which I quite appreciated. She tells you the best places to fish and dive, where to shop or swim, she talks about the architecture particular to one area or another. All in all this certainly seems to be a great book for the price, and while I cannot comment on the complete accuracy of her information, the book certainly makes me want to go to the Keys soon!	2001-03-02

It would be a perfect gift for a young girl in her early teens that has been bitten by the horse bug. It has over 100 pages, with a large black and white photo on one side, and an essay on the other. Some of the essays are short, some are boring, and some make you wonder why you bought this book. But then you read the ones that bring tears to your eyes and you know why. This book shows us women and the horses they love, and in their own words they tell us a little about themselves and their horse. It's not a glorious coffee table book like GaWaNi Pony Boy's is, but it is a charming book to read and pass along to other women, or our daughters who share our love of horses.	2001-03-02

On the one hand, it's filled with some very lovely photos of some quite interesting greeting cards. On the other hand, there is no attempt made to identify the artists or publishers of the various cards. So the book is really rather useless as a reference book of any sort. But the photos are very well done, the colors bright, and if you know what you're looking at it's an interesting view at the collection of someone who managed to get theirs published somehow (it was published in Japan.)<br />But don't buy this book if you're thinking of using it as a reference, as there's no info there to which you can refer.	2001-03-02

This excellent reference book is a must-have for any collector of this wonderful at pottery. The authors obviously took some real time and effort to put the book together, and their work really shows. There is a great section on the history of the pottery, with sections on past and recent history (including info about the Rocky River library purchase). There is discussion of the various artists who worked for or did designs for Cowan, including: Bogatay, Martin, Jossett, Gregory, Winter, Hummel, Cowan himself, and Schreckengost of course. A section discusses the bodyware, glaze, and pottery marks, and there is a special section on the famous Jazz Bowl.<br />The rest of the book consists of an identification and value guide. It's chock-full of mostly color photos of various Cowan pieces, with sizes given, as well as prices (although it's worth noting that the prices are no longer quite accurate, due to the effect that online auctions have had on collectibles of late). The photos are sharp for the most part, with details shown clearly. All in all this is a great book for the Cowan collector.	2001-03-01

This book is just what I've been looking for. It's a huge reference on the science of bitting for horses, and covers both English and Western bits and techniques. It's filled with tons of clear color photographs showing the various types of bits available out there, and long discussions about the whys and wherefores of choosing the proper bit for your horse.<br />The following chapters are included: The Language of the Bridle; Anatomy and Bit Selection; Dentistry and Mouth Care; an Introduction to Bits and Bridles: Fundamental Principles of Bitting; Snaffle Bits; Mouthpieces; Leverage Bits; Trade Offs; Gag Bits; Going Bitless; the Traditional Hackamore; the Spade Bit; Bit Accessories and Training Aids; Bit Progressions and Soft Mouths; Developing Soft Hands; Problems, Solutions, and Safety; Bitting and Competition.

It's a slim volume, only about 100 pages, but chock-full of wisdom from ancient Chinese leaders and kings. It's amazing to read through this book and see how much is still pertinent in today's world, especially the business world. There are principles from six classic sources: Master Wei Lao; The Book of Three Strategies; The Book of Six Strategies; The Warrior Code of the Cavaliers; Wu Qi's Art of War, Sun Tzu's Art of War.<br />Topics covered include everything from warfare to statesmanship, governance to strategy, leadership and teamwork. Each writer has their own section, and there is a long table of contents in the beginning which lists each piece in the order in which they are presented. This book would make a great gift for any student of strategy, be they businessperson or merely scholar.	2001-02-25

This book is more philosophical than some others of similar titles and natures are. It views leadership and strategy through the lens of Taoist thinking, and as such is more concerned with the spiritual and ethical development of a leader. The book is broken into four sections: State and Society; Warfare; Peace; and Wisdom. Each is linked to the other, and follows the previous topic. There is a lot of discussion on the health of a given society, and how both the heads of a society as well as the people within it reflect and affect its overall health. There is a lot of focus on the causes and effects of warfare, as well as the ethics of waging war properly.<br />This is a small book, one that you can keep in your pocket or briefcase, perfect in size for reading on the train into work or while sitting in a doctor's office. It's full of essays that will make you think, and perhaps re-evaluate how you deal with certain situations in your life. It is worth buying, no question about that.	2001-02-25

My kids find the Fandex format easy to use, and the information on them accessible.

There are also several paragraphs of pertinent information about each state, with some history and a description of the character and things, which make it unique.<br />The only quibble I have about these decks is that sometimes when they're completely fanned out, the edges of the illustrations get caught up in each other, making it hard to close them properly.

I am a HUGE fan of Faith Javane's book &quot;Numerology and the Divine Triangle.&quot; It's the book I recommend whenever someone asks me for one to start with when studying numerology. This book provides some good additional information which can be used as an adjunct to her other book.<br />The book contains divinitory information on each of the 9 &quot;Master Numbers&quot;, from 11 to 99, with character descriptions and samples of others who have such numbers. Javane describes her theories as to why our society can now access the information available within these numbers (previously, only the 11 and 22 were considered Master Numbers). She describes the &quot;cycles of becoming&quot; that souls go through in their evolution through various incarnations, and talks about the way one can accept and work with or discard the opportunities presented to those with Master Numbers.<br />All in all a good book for fans of her other work, although fairly specialized. I found it worth the wait and price to special order.	2001-02-24

I have to agree somewhat (not completely) with one of the reviewers... This book is not well suited for girls who are nine or ten (my daughter is nine and a half). It's got a lot of good information, but some of the illustrations are too graphic (my daughter found the ones of male genitalia very disturbing, and she is not immature for her age). The age span on this book should be adjusted upwards to more like 12 and up, not 9 to 13.<br />That being said, this book covers a lot of ground, and for the most part does so well. It has a lot of important information found in books of this type: stages of puberty, signs to look for, the female reproductive cycle, bras, getting one's period, and so on. All these things are presented clearly, although again, I feel they're geared more towards older girls, rather than pre-teens.<br />All in all this is an ok book, but not excellent, and is not appropriate for the age range it's listed for. Buy this book for a 12 year-old or up, but don't push the envelope with younger girls, they don't need the pressure that such graphically displayed information provides, which can overwhelm them.	2001-02-24

I bought this book for my husband for Christmas, and we've both come to like it very much. Neither of us are &quot;knot aficionados&quot;, as it were, but wanted a book which would allow us to explore some knots we might need in our outdoor activities (horseback riding, camping, sailing, etc.) As the beginners at knotmaking we are, this book has proven to be excellent for us.<br />At the very beginning the book has a directory of the knots contained, listed by name, page number, application (sailing, caving, climbing, and so on), and description. In the introduction the book covers a number of topics: knotlore; terms, tips, and techniques; ends; and tips on using the book. In the main part of the book, each knot has a small photo of a finished knot, an explanation of the application of the knot, numerous diagrams showing the knot being tied, a description of the tying of the knot, and a brief history of the knot itself.<br />I really don't understand why some of the other reviewers feel so strongly about this book, as a neophyte to the world of knots, I found it more than adequate, and it served my needs well. And I find my husband returning to it again and again, as he slowly falls under the spell of knots, well on his way to becoming a true knot geek. If you're a beginner looking for a practical guide to knotmaking, this book will suit you well.	2001-02-24

My kids find the Fandex format easy to use, and the information on them accessible. We have several, and they're fun for all of us to use together.<br />This Fandex is a little different than some others, as it's not a field guide or atlas, but rather a sort of timeline or chronology of a period of history in America. It begins with the causes of the war, describes secession, touches on significant events during the war, talks about the political issues behind the war, and has a number of pages featuring important persons as well as significant battles. I am not a Civil War scholar, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of the information presented. But I find this an interesting way to introduce the topic to my children.<br />The only quibble I have about these decks is that sometimes when they're completely fanned out, the edges of the illustrations get caught up in each other, making it hard to close them properly.

I love to just sit and page through it, reading quotes by modern day authors, poets, and artists. I turn to it to look something up and wind up reading through it for an hour or more. Funny quotes, sad quotes, quotes that epitomize life in the 20th century.<br />The format is pretty standard for books of this type. Artists are listed alphabetically, by the names they are known, (Maya Angelou, rather than Maya Johnson, for example). The index uses the standard format of listing the significant words from each quotation, these keywords also listed alphabetically. Then the first few letters of the author's name are shown, along with the page number and the item number of the quote itself. I didn't find any problems with pagination, as did another reviewer, every quote I looked up had an accurate page and item number (perhaps he is dealing with an older edition than I am).<br />All in all a wonderful book, and an excellent addition to any reference library. Don't hesitate, buy it!	2001-02-24

This book is, on the one hand, convenient to have, as it contains all the works of the Bard in one spot. On the other hand, for those of us who grew up weaned on the individual Arden editions in school, with their gloriously thorough footnotes, this is bound to disappoint.<br />I guess this is a good volume to have to ensure you have everything, from womb to tomb, soup to nuts. Then, hie oneself off to look for the older individual editions for the footnotes we crave. Nice to have (a bit pricey, even as big as it is), but not really complete.	2001-02-24

It took me a while to get into, I had to slog through the first fifty pages or so, but once I did I was hooked by the plot. The characters seem to blossom before our eyes, and we become drawn into their lives, their desires, and their troubles.<br />However, the plot tends to jerk us around a bit, going this way and that, and there's not sufficient development to suck us in deeply enough to avoid feeling thrashed about. Things are smooth, then BOOM, we're dropped into another scene, where things lag for too long. Then, BOOM, another shift of gears, and we're in another place altogether. I found this abruptness hard to work through, and got frustrated several times.<br />But each time I returned to the book, and made it through. I did feel the ending was a little too pat, as if the author got tired of the book, and just wound it all together and was done. But I didn't mind the ending (some folks did), I just felt it needed to be more drawn out in order to be justified. All in all a pleasant read (although I don't think I'd shell out for the hardback).	2001-02-24

As an adult, I find myself picking it up to look up one particular thing, and I still get sucked in for an hour or more. I have a ton of those little Post-It flags in the book to help me remember something I want to pass onto a friend. I use this book regularly, and it's one I'd never want to give up.<br />The book is arranged in a fairly standard format. At the beginning there is the alphabetical index of authors with page numbers. Then the quotes begin, listed chronologically (with which I have absolutely no problem, unlike some other reviewers). They begin with &quot;The Song of the Harper&quot; from c. 2650 - 2600 B.C. and go all the way to Monty Python, 1969 - 1974. There is a nice section of quotes by the famous &quot;Anonymous&quot;, as well as nursery rhymes, shanties, and spirituals.

Mind you, it's so esoteric in some parts that I don't even understand it, so I cannot comment on it completely.<br />The book starts out with a discussion of various-pointed stars, from seven through twelve. She gets very mystical, and surprisingly, religious (Divine Triangle contains no such slant.) The second half of the book dives into very complicated, &quot;Esoteric Astrology&quot; and &quot;Pentacle Analysis&quot;. It's all way beyond me, and not what I expected (it would have been nice to have had some editorial info on this book!)<br />This would be a great book for fans of Javane who are also students of astrology, but if you purchase it expecting it to have information about numerology (as her other books do), you'll be disappointed.	2001-02-24

I bought this book used, in paperback, and as such was not disappointed. It's not &quot;literature&quot;, it's not Austen, for goodness sakes, but it was entertaining as I sat by the pool and watched my kids splash during Spring Break.<br />The book is a collection of short stories, thrown together to arc throught the life of one &quot;Jane&quot;, a frustrated preppie who tries for years to get her life together, (especially her love life) and finally succeeds at the end of the book. Saved by the bell, she meets, and despite her best efforts to sabotage herself, wins her dream man, and they live happily ever after.<br />This book was nowhere near what I'd consider deep. It had some nice moments, some good dialogue, some clever imagery. Sometimes I wanted to give Jane a little shake, and tell her &quot;get over it!&quot; and get on with it, but all in all it was a worthwhile read.

This book works for me some of the time, but not all.<br />The individual entries are fairly long and complete, however I wish there were more entries.

However, whenever I refer to this book to determine the meaning behind an element in a dream I've had, the explanation given just doesn't seem to fit at all (and some are so ridiculous as to make me shake my head).<br />I am not an expert on dreams, but I've had other books which seemed to explain things better for me. Perhaps different people need different dream interpretations, and books.

She breaks the recipes into four sections: &quot;L'Ancienne Tradition&quot;, &quot;Les Specialistes&quot;, &quot;Les Grands Classiques&quot;, and &quot;Les Jeunes Artisans Extraordinaires.&quot; In each section she highlights several patissiers or boulangers, and the recipes which make them unique.<br />The only problem I had with this book is it made me want to run out and buy the ingredients I needed to make some of these delectables. From Pate aux Trois Viandes en Croute, to Mousee au Caramel at aux Poires, it's just too hard to resist! Whether you're a fan of traditional or nouveau French pastry, this book will satisfy your cravings for the taste of Paris we all long for.	2001-02-22

This reference would be a wonderful addition to any silver collector's library. It contains over 2400 marks, along with information about over 1600 manufacturers of American silver. Unlike some other books (Kovel's wonderful guide comes to mind), it goes into a bit more depth, with histories of and information about the makers themselves, rather than just the marks. There are lots of black and white photos, showing some of the marks themselves as well as samples of the works on which they appear. All in all an excellent reference for either the collector or the dealer of American silver, and worth the wait to order.	2001-02-22

This is a terrific book! It covers the complete spectrum of Tiffany silver flatware from 1845 to 1905. It's lavishly illustrated with photographs, diagrams, and original pattern drawings. It covers the full-line patterns, the not-full-line patterns, and the custom patterns made for the likes of the Vanderbilts and the Hearsts.<br />The book breaks the patterns down by designer: early pieces by retailers Polhamus, Hebbard, Gorham, Moore and others; the major designers Edward Moore, Charles Grosjean, and Paulding Parnham. It shows the various place pieces in standard patterns, as well as covering the extensive amount of fabulous and rare serving and other odd pieces (how many of you own a scallop serving fork?) There are also several useful appendices, including: Flatware Terminology; Glossary of Technical Terms; Tiffany Flatware Markings; and a Tiffany Chronology. As well, a thorough index makes it easy to find patterns or pieces you are looking for.<br />All in all this is the perfect book for the collector of this wonderful silver. It does not contain pricing information, which is a good thing in this day and age of online auctions, as such pricing info is often outdated by the time the book reaches the press. The only problem I had after reading it was that I wanted to own everything in the book! Don't hesitate, buy it!	2001-02-20

This is a very useful book. It's not fabulous, but very helpful, especially when trying to identify a particular pattern. The bulk of the book is made up of line drawings of the handle of the spoon in a particular pattern, showing only one side (front) and no detail of the bowl. That being said, the drawings are very detailed and allow for good identification of a piece. The patterns are sorted by manufacturer, and give dates as well as pattern names. There is also a code which designated whether the pattern is older or newer, popular or not sought after, and whether it is handwrought.<br />At the end there is a two page diagram of marks, (wish it were larger), as well as an extensive index. All in all this book is worth the price, and if you need to identify a piece, don't hesitate to buy it.	2001-02-20

Pullman succeeded with this second book in his trilogy (His Dark Materials) in adding more complex weft to the warp of the theme he is weaving here. More threads come into play, more characters (young Will, the bearer of the Knife in question), more worlds to explore, foes to fight (or avoid), more moral and theological questions are raised.<br />This series is a very ambitious one, and raises questions that only older teens are ready to deal with (most of this would be lost on a ten year old). Many of the concepts and philosophical questions are suited mostly for adults, but that should not lessen the experience for teens.<br />In this installment &quot;the plot thickens&quot;, as it were, and we're introduced one of the objects around which the books revolve, a knife which can cut open doors between worlds. As well, the religious concepts are expanded, we're introduced to the bene elim (the angels), the meaning of Dust is made clear to us, and the fight between the Creator and the rebels becomes distinct.<br />All in all this middle installment of this series works quite well. It focuses things which the first book brought into play, introduces complexity and density of plot, and gives us new characters to flesh out the cast. It's a good staging ground for the third book in the series, which pulls all these elements together into a dazzling tapestry of light and magic. A wonderful book...	2001-02-16

As he is with horses, Rashid is very subtle and doesn't try to cram his way of thinking down our throats, but uses stories to lead by example. The root of his theory here is &quot;passive leadership&quot;, which can be a somewhat misleading term if you don't understand his meaning. It doesn't mean to be passive and let your horse dominate you, but to become a leader to your horses, through demonstrating behavior that they can trust.<br />It's all about trust. Rashid looks into the minds and hearts of horses and reminds us how they look at the world. Horses are herd animals, and always behave as such. Humans, coming from a predator background, are not as consistant and predictable in our behavior as our horses would have us be. Rashid gives us methods to modify our behavior in order to gain the trust of our horses. In doing so, we learn to work with them, rather than force them, to achieve our goals.<br />The book is written in a laid back style, there are no formal exercises to work through, it's more a philosophical treatise than a practical manual. But it gets you thinking about how you can change the way you relate to your horse, and in doing so, create a better relationship with them, which will lead to increased happiness for both of you. All in all this is a wonderful book for the serious horseman or horsewoman, and begs to be kept and re-read again and again. Don't hesitate, buy it!	2001-02-16

This is not a book (or trilogy) for younger readers. I'd recommend this for kids 15 or so and up, as some of the concepts are too complex for younger minds. But for those teens (and adults!) who are willing to work with the concepts presented (religion, deception, good which is seemingly evil and vice versa), this book can be quite fufilling.<br />It has all the elements of a good fantasy. A heroine who is all too human, a desparate quest, a long journey through dangerous lands, helpful friends and allies, a terrible foe, magical devices to help the hero, and so on. Lyra Silvertongue and her alter ego Pantalaimon find their lives uprooted by a twist of fate, and off on their quest they go.<br />As with all trilogies, this first book ends leaving us hanging, wishing for more. I'd advise buying all three books together and reading them one right after the other, so as to not lose the train of thought. There is much complex detail which needs to be kept in the mind, and trying to do so piecemeal would be quite hard.<br />All in all a thoroughly wonderful book of fantasy and magic for the older youth reader, or even a youthful minded adult.	2001-02-16

Pullman has done it - woven together all the disparate pieces of thread he laid out for us in the first two novels, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;, into a stunning tapestry of magic and light. This conclusion to the series starts off with a shift of scene, drops us into one world after another, and ends up with a bang and a whisper (no spoilers in this review).<br />I was not upset by the religious and theological questions posed in this novel (and series) as some other reviewers were. They were central to the plot, and not an attack on Christianity per se. I loved the ending (some of my friends did not) and felt it worked perfectly.<br />I like books that make me think, which this one does with a vengance. I like fantasy that has depth and breadth, which this does in abundance. I like characters who mature and grow with the books, which these do, no question. All in all this book more than delivers on the promise of the first two, and like the best in fantasy it left me wanting to be able to cut a doorway there myself to go and experience it in person. Marvelous.	2001-02-16

She has recently fallen in love with Dr. Seuss books, and poetry in general. And this book, along with other Seuss books, gives her great joy. We read it together, out loud, enjoying the scan and ryhme of the words and sentences. And on that level, it's one of her favorites.<br />But after we read it, we talk about the concepts behind it, how &quot;a person's a person, no matter how small&quot;, and how Horton realizes the inherent dignity in all life, regardless of whether or not it fits into our commonly held conceptions. This book allows me to open up discussions on race, and religion, and the external aspects of persons, and how often we judge people (sometimes unfairly) based on how they look, rather than on their actions.<br />I highly recommend this book for any schoolchild and parent to read together, reveling in the language and fun, and then use as a stepping stone to further discussions about life and personhood.	2001-02-14

My six year-old, in particular, loves the way Seuss puts words together with his irresistable blend of scansion and rhyme. His books can be read on several levels at least, and most of his stories contain some sort of lesson or other that a parent can use to initiate discussions about larger topics.<br />This book has three stories, one about an ambitious turtle, one about a vain bird, and one about two silly braggarts. All three are short, can be read easily, and raise questions about morals which young children can understand and explore. My favorite of the three is the first, Yertle the Turtle, and his insatiable quest to be the biggest and best, which leads to his eventual downfall.<br />This is not my absolute favorite of all Seuss's books, but it's a good one, and one I can recommend heartily for any parent and child.	2001-02-14

I bought this book for my daughter after she and I had our first &quot;talk&quot; about periods and sex. It's a light-hearted book, written by a woman and her teenaged neice, and it is fairly specific in that it pretty much only addresses issues about getting one's period (not boys, nor sex, much).<br />The book outlines the changes which young girls go through as they mature, and discusses the various things which happen, both mentally and physically, as they approach their first period. It covers the options young women have to deal with their period, what to do if there are problems, how to talk to your parents about it (and listen to them try to talk to you!), and has a list of &quot;What If...&quot; questions which covers most issues.<br />The book is illustrated with line drawings (almost cartoons) which deal with issues in a sensitive but easy manner. There's even a spot in the back for notes or letters to one's parents. I'd rate the age range for this book from about 10 and up. All in all it's a good value for its price, and answers many of the questions a young girl has about this touchy subject.	2001-02-12

This is a wonderful book. I bought it for my six and nine year-olds, and we've had a lot of fun going through it together. It covers a lot of the science of the human body, and explains things well in a clear yet thorough way. There are over 100 facts and definitions of things covered; lots of &quot;hands on&quot; exercises; hundreds of line drawings and diagrams; and brief biographies of important scientists who contributed to the study of the human body.<br />All in all a great book chock full of info for kids, especially for the price.	2001-02-12

For those of us who revel in collecting ephemera (printed paper of all sorts), this book provides a feast of information and visual overviews. The author covers the following subjects (among others): collecting ephemera; sources and values; conservation and display; the various printing processes; various categories (such as tradecards, letterheads, handbills, poster stamps, playing card stationery, book labels, valentines, and rewards of merit); a variety of themes (such as travel, funeralia, crime and punishment, rural life, cigar packaging, education, and entertainment); and includes a wonderful glossary, reference of papers and watermarks, and a good bibliography.<br />All in all a must-have for the serious collector of ephemera (you know who you are!), and well worth the price to special order.

I liked this book, don't get me wrong. But I did find it a little thin, especially in light of all the topics it covers. That may be a good thing, as most young girls don't need or want to go into a lot of depth on these subjects. But compared to several other books of this nature, I found it a bit sparse.<br />That being said, the book does cover a variety of topics, from choosing a first bra, to developing breasts, internal reproductive organs, external reproductive organs (female only, and not in depth), menstrual periods and dealing with them, and in several places there are comments regarding appropriate behavior by adults towards children (which I was glad was included).<br />All in all it's a nice book for the price, if you don't mind it skimming the surface, rather than delving into these topics.	2001-02-12

I bought this book for my husband at Christmas, and we've both fallen in love with it. He looks at it so often it just sits on the floor by his chair now, never making it back to the bookcase. It contains over 250 pages of excellent information for the rider, English or Western, as well as historical information about the origins of tack and saddles.<br />The book starts out with a history of tack, up through the making of the modern saddle; covers specialty saddles; has an extensive section on bits, bridles and additional aids; covers driving and farm harnesses; various training aids, outlines a well-equipped stable; illustrates various cerimonial trappings, and shows us samples of riding dress.<br />There are thousands of marvelous photographs, both black &amp; white as well as color; pages of line drawing illustrations; charts; diagrams; the works! It's not an inexpensive book, but for the serious rider it's well worth the investment. If you are such, don't hesitate, go for it!	2001-02-11

I got my kids two strategy guides when Pokemon Gold &amp; Silver came out, this one and the &quot;official&quot; Nintendo one. Of the two, this one has gotten MUCH more use. My daughters have marked lots of areas with PostIt flags, the pages are dog-eared, the back is getting ripped, you know they use it!<br />I realize the previous reviewers noted some minor problems with this guide, but all in all they're just that, minor. No, this guide does not have a built-in Pokedex, they published it before they had the info put together for the Pokedex, and I'm fine with that (see my review of the new Pokedex here on Amazon, it's well worth having too!). And yes, there are some typos, but that's not a big deal.<br />There is a lot to love about this guide. It has comparison charts for the various types of Pokemon, so you know which type to use when battling. There are pages and pages on everything from TMs to HMs, Berries to Apricorns, the various Pokeball types to the new Mystery Gift items. There's an in-depth section on breeding Pokemon, as well as the newest ways to evolve them (stones versus the happiness factor). There's a great quick and dirty path through the game, which you can check to make sure you didn't miss anything. And best of all, there's a special &quot;sealed&quot; section in the back with spoiler info which you can open or not, depending on whether you're an adult (yes, I know you grownups out there play this game!) or a 6 year-old who needs help through the Tin Tower.<br />All in all this guide is well worth the money, and if you've got more than one kid playing these games, I'd advise you to get two, to spare yourselves the fighting over it. Don't hesitate, buy it!	2001-02-11

I've been riding on and off all my life since my grandfather put me on a horse at the tender age of three. This book explores the relationships we, as women, have with our beasties, and does so beautifully. Through the words of 22 women from all walks of life: cowgirls to princesses; barrel racers to show jumpers; we see the intricate, emotional, complex relationship that women have with their horses.<br />The book has an essay on horses by each of the women featured, and is illustrated with beautiful photographs, expressive watercolors, textural oils, and graceful line drawings. It's a book to be savored, read in the evening when you won't be distracted, sipped gently like a fine wine, not gulped. It's a book to come back to again and again, to re-read the essays, to empathize with the writers, and to ponder anew the comments that GaWaNi makes after each piece. It's a book which captures, in physical form, the ephemeral relationship we have with our 'mulies. It's rather surprising that a man could do so, but given this man's expertise with horses, I suppose not so much so.<br />If you're looking for a gorgeous book to celebrate the special bond between horses and women, this is the one to buy.	2001-02-11

There is info on in-season Pokemon (where and when you can catch them); info on pre-evolved (baby) Pokemon, info on capturing some of the more special Pokemon; instructions for the various forms of evolution; and then a page by page list of each Pokemon complete with all its moves and information, comparing Gold and Silver with Red, Blue, and Yellow. The Pokemon are listed by number as well as A-Z, so you're sure to find the one you're looking for.

I bought this book for my husband this past Christmas, but wasn't sure I would like it all that well. I am a classically trained English rider (have been riding on and off since I was 3) and have worked with horses in many different environments. My husband rides Western though, and I have spent some time on a Native American reservation, so I thought we'd like it.<br />The surprise for me was how it has changed the way I think.<br />Many riders are trained to dominate their horse, to &quot;show him who's boss&quot;. This attitude works, sometimes, but doesn't always lead to a healthy partnership, and sometimes leads to frustration and agression. GaWaNi, like some other trainers these days (Mark Rashid comes to mind), suggests a different approach, one I was quite impressed with when reading. He speaks of Relationship Training, of the creation of the two-member herd, the &quot;Itancan&quot; (leader) and &quot;Waunca&quot; (imitator). When we are with our horse, we can establish such a relationship with him (or her), and using natural herd behavior, work together with our animals in a  partnership, rather than force them to do things simply because we &quot;tell&quot; them to. It seems a very natural way to do things, and one I plan to put into effect with my own horse (I'll come back and write another review once I've tried these techniques).<br />I have only a few tiny quibbles. The book is gorgeous, and that prevents me from taking it with me to the barn, which I'd like to do. It's almost a cross between a coffee table book and a manual, and frankly, I'd have had more use for a manual I wouldn't be afraid to get dirty. But, that just means I'll have to take notes, not a bad thing in and of itself. As well, I do think there was some generalization going on regarding Native American peoples that might have been avoided (not all NAs are alike, any more than any other type or race of person).<br />All in all though, if you're looking for a fresh view at the relationship you have with your horse, this book can provide it to you. It made me think, and decide to change the way I do things with my horse. And I plan to try a number of the exercises listed in the book (I'm always looking for an excuse to ride bareback anyway!). So if you're a serious rider who respects and loves their horse, and who desires to learn to communicate more effectively with him or her, buy this book.ship you have with your horse, this book can provide it to you.

I am a traditionally trained Reiki Master/Teacher who has been working with Reiki since 1995. There are many good books on Reiki out there, but this is not one of them.<br />Among the problems I have with this book, the first is the printing of the symbols (which most traditionally trained RMTs feel is very wrong). It's not even so much that the symbols are printed (although I was taught that they are sacred and as such are not to be published), but the fact that the symbols shown are drawn incorrectly. As well, without being attuned to Reiki, the symbols are useless!<br />I also strongly question Stein's committment when I read descriptions of her attuning many people, one after another, assembly-line style. Reiki is a practice which is best passed along from teacher to student, by a teacher who makes a committment to the student. It can't be possible to make a proper committment to train someone and follow through with them if you're attuning 50 some-odd people at once. A proper teacher realizes that her students are her responsibility for life, and that she should be there for them after their attunement, not just during. As a RMT once said to me, &quot;We are Master Teachers, not Master Attuners.&quot;<br />Stein also makes Reiki much more complicated than it needs to be. She adds things in where they are not needed, muddles things up, prints misinformation and presents it as truth. All this does is make people confused about what Reiki really is.<br />And just for the record, please note that anyone who says they can make you a Reiki practitioner through the use of a &quot;distant attunement&quot; is either confused or outright lying. Yes, we can send distant healing, but in order to channel the healing energy of Reiki yourself, you must be attuned *in person* by a Reiki Master/Teacher.<br />There are other good books on Reiki available out there, and I would urge anyone who wants to learn more about Reiki to seek them out, or to find a reputable RMT in their town and ask to speak to them, or even go for a sample treatment. But this book is not going to help anyone find the simple yet powerful energy that is true Reiki.<br />Please feel free to email me if you have further questions about this book or Reiki in general.town and ask to speak to them, or even go for a sample treatment.

As a Reiki Master/Teacher I read a lot of Reiki books. This manual is the best one I've come across in my years of teaching and practicing. It covers a variety of subjects, including the history and philosophy of Reiki, procedures for treating with Reiki (people, animals, and even plants), and gives detailed charts, pictures, and explanations of using Reiki to heal.<br />One of the parts I like best about this manual is that on each page where the various hand positions are shown is a spot where students can take notes during class. That allows students to keep important things together with the manual, rather than having a lot of loose papers to keep track of. I will note that several of the hand positions are slightly different than those I was taught and teach, but that's a minor quibble, as practitioners know that Reiki goes where it is meant to go.<br />I especially like the section which focuses on pets and wildlife. I have been working a lot of late using Reiki to treat horses, with wonderful results, and this book is helpful to those who wish to work with animals. It has several diagrams of basic dog and cat anatomy, and gives instruction on hand positions for them.<br />All in all this is a great book. It's not perfect, but it's the best out there bar none.

This book is an excellent one for any student of dressage. It might be a wee bit complicated for the absolute beginner to riding, but for most who have had some training it's appropriate. The book has a ton of excellent diagrams and illustrations, many showing the view from above so that the desired position of the horse is clearly shown. There are a number of exercises in each chapter which allow the rider to work on various elements on their own as well as with a trainer.<br />Chapters include: The Horse - How it Functions; Lungeing; The Work in Hand; The Basic Work in All Three Gaits; Activating the Hindquarters; Competition; Special Exercises for Problems; Canter Work; Collection, Extension and In-Between; Piaffe; and Passage. There is also an index which allows you to refer to specific topics.<br />All in all this is a valuable addition to the library of any equestrian interested in this branch of the discipline, and one I will be sharing with my trainer. Don't hesitate to buy it!	2000-10-21

This book is a great book for kids between about 6 and 12. It can be looked at on several levels. On one level, it's a coloring book kids can fill in which has pictures of a number of pagan principles and archetypes. On another level this book is a tool a parent can use to discuss the more complicated aspects of human religions and how tolerance is important for all the paths that we as humans walk.<br />The book has pages which include: moon phases, what a worship circle is and means to a pagan, aspects of the Goddess and the God, various pagan symbols and their meanings, a discussion of the various pagan holidays (focusing mostly on Celtic/Wicca ones), and discusses the Wiccan Rede. As well there are mazes, games, and puzzles for kids to do.<br />All in all this is a well-rounded introduction to pagan ideas for children. It's a good book for pagan families, as well as those who may simply be exploring other religions. Don't hesitate to buy it.	2000-10-21

While they've been interested in horses for many years, they didn't start formal lessons until this year. As a horsewoman of many years I've been pleased to share my interest with them, and wanted to give them a good starter book. This is perfect for that.<br />The book has only 65 pages, but with its large size and wealth of photos it does an excellent job of communicating a large amount of information. It covers a number of topics, including: chosing a riding school; basic tack and equipment; various gaits; jumping; trail and road riding; grooming and stable care; food and feeding; horse and pony health; showing your horse; and other basic equestrian principles. There is also an excellent glossary and index to round out the book.<br />All in all this is a great introductory book for kids up to teens, and if your child has expressed an interest in learning more about horses and riding English, this is a good book to buy.	2000-10-21

I have been using Feng Shui for some years now, and have a number of books on this topic. This book is a very good book in some ways, but is perhaps not the best first book for someone to buy who is looking for an introduction to Feng Shui.<br />The subject of Feng Shui is actually very complicated, and there are several schools of study which use different techniques to make their recommendations. This book does go into a very good explanation of the Five Element theory, talking about the effects of Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, and Wood and how they control or modify each other. It also gives a nice explanation of how Feng Shui correlates with Chinese Astrology, and gives a brief overview the various astrological personalities.<br />From there the book begins to get very complicated. It discusses the effects of the compass placement of a particular house on the placement of things within the house. It talks about the alignment of the Ba Gua according the the direction of the house, and gets quite complicated in its workings. I find that for the average North American or European this is too much technical information and is more than we need to know. It is possible to effectively apply the basic principles of Feng Shui to the average non-Asian home without getting quite so deep into esoterica.<br />All in all, I would recommend this book as an adjunct to others you should have in your library if you're really interested in this subject. But if you're looking for a basic introduction and working manual for Feng Shui try either &quot;Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life&quot; or &quot;Interior Design with Feng Shui&quot;, both available here on Amazon.	2000-10-21

It is filled with excellent charts and illustrations, as well as thorough explanations of techniques the average horse owner/lover can use to help create and increase wellness in their horse.<br />The book covers the following: Anatomy and Physiology of the Horse; The Horse and Massage Therapy; Principles and Concepts of Massage; Hydrotherapy; Massage Techniques and Routines; Kinesiology of the Horse; Stretching; Conformation Check-up Routine; Body Parts and Their Stress Points; Areas of Stress Specific to Each Discipline; Keeping Records.<br />This book begs to be taken to the stable with you, and the format makes it easy to use there. It is spiral bound, which makes it easy to leave open to a section from which you're working, and the cover is easily wiped off if it gets dirty (not that we ever get dirty at the barn, eh?). All in all this is a marvelous book, don't hesitate to buy it!	2000-10-21

In the Poisonwood Bible Kingsolver has written a many-layered, multiple-themed novel of family relationships. A missionary family leaves mid-America during the '60s and moves to the Congo, with unexpected results. The novel speaks with the voices of the women involved, the mother Orleanna, and her three daughters; Leah, Rachel, and Adah. Kingsolver ably gives voice to each of these women, and shows how each views their experience and the man in their lives (the preacher father, Nathan) differently.<br />The book takes a bit of determination to read, but rewards same with depth of characterization and plot. We follow the various family members over some 30 years of their lives, from the US to the Congo, and back again. Each woman reacts differently to the experience of living in Africa, some reach out and embrace the country and its people, some reject the experience and strive to remain the American girls they once were. The process is fascinating to watch, and it is easy to identify with the characters.<br />The book does bog down a bit from place to place, but by the time it does you're hooked and so slog on to the finish. It's not mind-candy, but it is a rewarding read.	2000-10-15

I read this book with my book club, and I must admit I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. My initial perceptions were based on the trailer from the movie (which I saw before I read the book), and it seemed as if the book would be pretty one-dimensional. I was pleasantly surprised to find it more complex and interesting to read than I'd thought.<br />The book follows the trials and tribulations of Novalee Nation, a  pregnant 17 year-old whose idiot boyfriend leaves behind during a cross-country trip to find a new life. I'll give the kid credit, she doesn't dissolve, but adapts well to her unfortunate situation and camps out in the local Walmart, where she winds up having her baby. The book explores her growing relationships with various inhabitants of the town, and we get to watch her and her baby grow and mature.<br />I was pleased by the several plot twists, including the offbeat love story angle. It made the novel more interesting and easier to read. The darker aspects of the novel fit in well, and added depth to the otherwise shallow plot. I didn't find things too contrived, and really liked the ending. All in all worth buying in paperback when you're looking for a quick beach or airplane read.	2000-10-15

The book is filled with color photos as well as black and white line drawings so you know exactly what she is referring to. As well, she puts in sidebars which go over the reasons why or why not you might want to use a particular piece of tack. Included are some history on various types of equipment and techniques for using the various items correctly.<br />All in all this is a wonderful book for the English rider of any age or skill level.

I read this book while on vacation this past summer, and it was a perfect beach book. It mixes a variety of interesting angles, with a pleasing result.<br />The book takes us back in time to medieval France, to the days of knights in shining armor and ladies in distress. Crighton throws in high-tech time travel, suspense, mystery, and a critical time limit (if you don't get back to your time machine within the deadline, you're stuck there forever).<br />I liked the historical novel parts of the book, giving insight as to how real life must have been for women in the past (not everyone was a sighing lady, waiting for her knight to woo her), and the techno geek additions blended well with the story. The plot did get a little complicated and cutesy at times, but hey, this is fiction, right?<br />All in all worth the read, especially if you're a fan of historical fiction mixed with light SF.	2000-10-15

I am a traditionally trained Reiki Master/Teacher. I am also a horsewoman of many years, and a horse owner. I found this book to be a mixed bag of the good and the not so good.<br />My main complaint about this book is the inaccurate way Reiki is portrayed. If you buy this book thinking you'll be able to learn how to treat your horse with Reiki after reading it, you'll be sorely disappointed. Reiki can ONLY be learned IN PERSON from a Reiki Master/Teacher (beware of anyone who tells you they can attune you to Reiki over the Internet, they cannot.)<br />However, if you are already a Reiki practitioner, this book is a moderately useful tool to assist you in learning to treat horses with Reiki. There are other books out there which cover treating animals better than this, but none are specific to horses, so this might be a good addition to your library if you're looking for horse-specific works. But it's not quite what it promises to be, and there is the potential for people to be misled into thinking they can use Reiki on their horses after reading this book.<br />Please feel free to email me at &quot;laura@duluth.com&quot; if you have any questions about using Reiki on horses (it's a LOT of fun) or learning to channel Reiki yourself.	2000-10-14

I bought it about three days before I witnessed a registered acupuncturist performing acupressure on a number of horses at the barn where I board. He did exactly the same things this book demonstrates. I am a Reiki Master/Teacher, and this book fits right in with what I know about energy work and the use of Chi to heal.<br />The book is divided into seven chapters. The first covers Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), using the Five-Element theory, on which this approach is based. It explains things thoroughly, and allows you a basic understanding of what you can do with acupressure with your horse. There are many charts which illustrate the basic meridian systems in the horse in much detail, showing all the various points and discussing their functions and applications.<br />The authors walk you through a treatment, from start to finish, including pre-treatment and post-treatment guides, as well as a complete section on equine stretches. There is also a treatment log book to keep for your horse, and a whole large section on specific treatments for specific conditions. The authors also teach this system in seminars across the US, and can be scheduled to come give a clinic in your area if you get enough horse owners together to afford it.<br />All in all this is a fabulous book, one which I am finding fascinating to read and to put into practical application with my horse. It requires concentration to read, due to the fact that it contains much information, but it's laid out in an open and straightforward manner so that it's easy to understand. If you love your horse (who doesn't?) and want to help take responsibility for his/her health, don't hesitate to buy this book!	2000-10-13

I reviewed this book earler this summer, when I had just started following  this plan. At that time I thought it was working well. The proof is in the  pudding here (so to speak) and after following this plan (in conjunction  with the False Fat Diet plan, which is quite similar) I have lost 20  pounds.<br />This diet is easy for me to follow. As a Type O I have cut wheat  and dairy out altogether, buy organic meats, eat lots of fruits and veges,  nuts and seeds and get reasonable amounts of exercise.<br />It might be hard  to make the shift to this way of eating at first (I have to say I still  miss pizza!) but the benefits are tremendous. I don't limit the amounts  that I eat, I don't have to weigh or measure or count points or carbs or  calories. I just eat normal meals like a normal person, only I don't eat  things that my body reacts badly to. If you're willing to make some changes  in the way you eat, this plan can really work for you.

This book, while not filled with new and ground-breaking information, does provide parents with important information about what lies ahead for their children during their elementary school years.<br />As a mother of two  children in this age group, I have done a lot of work discovering on my own  much of the information in this book. I only wish someone had given me this  book when my eldest turned three! So for me, some of this information was  redundant, but for a new parent this would be a great gift.<br />The book is  organized well, with each grade having its own chapter. Each chapter  includes an overview of the grade, a description of a typical child of that  particular year, what each year should know when entering school, what will  typically be covered during that year, the most important subject that  year, and so on. Most importantly, the book gives a parent an idea of what  to expect, within the limits of regional and school-type boundaries, from a  given year.<br />All in all this book is worth having, especially for those  whose children are making the transition from home or preschool to more  formal education.	2000-07-07

I purchased this book for my 6 year old daughter. She and her older sister LOVE Digimon and Pokemon. This book provides them with a complete (at least until more are created) reference to all her favorite Digimon  characters.<br />The first section of the book gives a brief  &quot;history&quot; of the Digimon world and monsters, and also has a guide  to using the book for both types of trading cards. Next comes a large  section with one monster per page, with information about pronunciation of  the name, levels, numbers, groups, type, size, techniques, abilities, and a  description. At the end is a list of FAQS (frequently asked questions),  info on the card games, and an alphabetical listing.<br />All in all this is  a good resource for any Digimon fan, although it will probably be out of  date within a year or two, as they add more monsters to the roster.	2000-07-07

Mashburn writes terrific books. His Postcard Guide is the best general book out there. He also does specialized postcard books such as this one. Anyone who collects artist-signed postcards will want this book, no  question about it.<br />It is filled with hundreds of pages and pictures of  all our favorite artists, like Harrison Fisher, Philip Boileau, Earl  Christy, as well as the more obscure yet fabulous artists like Lupiac and  others. He covers a variety of categories, like Beautiful Ladies, Beautiful  Children, Nudes, Blacks, Sports, and Comics. He includes a reference  section in the front which goes over important information such as how to  determine the age of a card, grade a card's condition, and so on. My only  quibble with this book is that all the inside images are in black and  white, and I would have loved to see some in color.

The plot is more contemporary than some of his former work, dealing with biotechnology and cloning issues, rather than the more  history-based work he's done in the past. And I do like his work, this just  isn't one of his best.<br />The plot centers around a genetic researcher who  is doing a study on criminal behavior, using twins as her core group. She  comes across a series of identical twins who are raised apart, ideal for  research. As she goes along, she discovers that not only were they raised  apart, they were born of different mothers! During this process she comes  under the scrutiny of some very powerful men and runs afoul of their  political plans.<br />All in all this is, as a previous reviewer states, a  good beach read. It's face-paced, easy to digest, and moderately  entertaining. Looked at on its own, it's fine. But from the perspective of  some of Follett's other work, this is not up to his usual caliber. So, if  you're not a huge fan of his, go ahead and buy it, but if you are, be aware  you may be slightly disappointed.	2000-07-07

I don't normally read spy thrillers of this type, and this was the first of Forsyth's books I've read, but I loved it! I grabbed this book from my husband one day when I was bored, and was drawn in immediately by the tense  prose and gripping plotline. I won't give a synopsis, you can get that  above. But I will say I read this almost straight through from start to  finish.<br />No one seems to know how much of this novel is really true, and  in the end, that doesn't matter, because it's writen so well that it might  as well be true. The plot is crafted around a war that really happened, and  the author spoke with those who had taken part in the war, giving his work  an authenticity hard to match. If you're looking for an intelligent novel  of this genre, then this one is hard to beat. Don't hesitate!	2000-06-11

Most of the stories have a different  location, ranging from Cape Cod to Jacksonville, FL. In each we read of the  inner hopes and fears of a character, and explore their lives as they live  these out.<br />If you enjoy books with wit and humor, depth and exploration  of the relationships between family members, you'll be pleased with this  collection.	2000-06-11

This is the first book I've read of Riley's, and I really liked it. I won't give a synopsis, you can read that above, but I will touch on some areas which stood out for me.<br />I enjoyed the way Riley mixed in historical  figures with her plot, not revolving around them too much, but adding them  in for spice, as it were. I was pleased with the way the plot developed,  the characters grew and expanded (for the most part) as the story went  along. I liked the addition of the supernatural aspects: the angel of  history was a real hoot with his ascerbic comments, and the Master of All  Desires was a scream, preying upon the weaknesses of human vanity. <br />If,  as other reviewers state, is not as good as some of Riley's other work,  then I can't wait to read them! I was quite pleased with this book, and  would recommend it heartily.	2000-06-11

I know, I know, everyone speaks of what a classic this book is. And I must admit, when my book club decided to read this book I was initially pleased, as I really liked Razor's Edge. But of all ten of us in the club, only one  finished the book!<br />I got as far as page 394, so I really did try. But I  kept wanting to give Philip a shake, tell him to  &quot;get over it&quot;  and get on with his life already. Mildred was a perfect pill, and I was  quite annoyed with how she abused his faith and love. The other characters  were, for the most part, either one-dimensional, or unlikeable.<br />I know  I'll most likely get slammed for daring to say this, but I just didn't like  this book, and I was not the only one.

However I was slightly disappointed in this book, which I read right after reading &quot;Fist of God.&quot; The pacing  is ok, but slower than FOG, the characters are not as finely drawn, and the  plot seems more black and white, without the nuances I had expected.<br />All  in all, I'd say if your're looking for a good example of Forsyth's work,  &quot;Fist of God&quot;, or perhaps some of his earlier work, such as  &quot;Odessa Files&quot; would be a better choice.	2000-06-11

I won't give a syopsis of the book, you can read that above. I will say he enjoys the book immensely, read the whole thing through, and  refers to it regularly as needed. It was well worth the price I paid for it  as a gift, and he and I were quite pleased. If you're considering buying  this for someone who studies this period in American history, don't  hesitate.	2000-06-11

This book is not for the novice computer user. I bought this book for my 74 year-old father, who has just recently dipped his toe into the vastness of the Internet. He needed something that would let him look up the terms  he reads about so that he'd understand what a URL is, know how to read an  emoticon, and be able to chose between compressed or uncompressed JPEGs.<br />While the book gives him that information and more, it does so using  more complicated definitions than he'd like. He gripes that when he looks  something up, the definition is filled with words he doesn't know, which he  then has to go look up as well!<br />So, while this book might be an excellent  resource for an experienced computer user, it's not geared towards the  novice. What he needed was &quot;The Internet for Dummies&quot; or  something like that, but wouldn't get the joke if I'd sent it to him.<br />Bottom line, buy this book if you have a basis from which to work, avoid  it if you're just beginning in computer and online work.	2000-06-11

My daughter loves dinosaurs and adores playing t-ball. So this book was a natural choice when I got it for her last year. Although it's a board book, and really intended for smaller kids, the simple plot was easy for her to  follow as she learned to read, and the illustrations are well done and  lovely. All in all a good buy, especially for kids who combine a love of  dinos with a love of sports.	2000-06-11

These wonderful books will appeal to children of all ages and backgrounds. They will especially appeal to those kids who are reading the Harry Potter series now, with the myth and wonder of Aslan and his magical world,  Narnia. (I won't synopsize the plots, you can see those in the reviews  above.)<br />I read these books over and over as a child, and still read them  occasionally as an adult. They are terrific for older children to read on  their own, or to be read to younger children. As a child I was unaware of  the allegorical aspects of the books, and that can either be stressed or  not, as a parent chooses.<br />I too would recommend that the books be read  in the order they were published, since The Lion, The Witch, and the  Wardrobe is such a great introduction to the four children, Aslan, and  Narnia. These books will take your children into another world, filled with  magical talking creatures, one which will be with them all their lives.  Don't hesitate to buy this series, for yourself or your children!	2000-06-10

Happily, when my daughters were born in the early nineties, this book was re-published. It seems it's out of print now, which is a real shame, as it's a great book  filled with wonderful stories by a number of authors, and marvelous  illustrations by Garth Williams.<br />In this tall, skinny volume you'll find  stories, poems, riddles, rhymes, the works! Everything from  The Sugar Plum  Tree, by Eugene Field, to Calico Pie, by Edward Lear. This book is well  worth searching for using an out of print service such as Amazon.com uses,  so don't hesitate to do so, it's worth the wait!	2000-06-10

It took me three tries and some months to get past the first 50 pages. But once I did, I was hooked.<br />Straub has taken a mass of threads, all seemingly unrelated, thrown them in a pile in  the beginning, and then spent the next 400-odd pages sorting them out and  then weaving them into a complex tale of murder, mythology, horror,  literary reference, and more. I won't bother to do a synopsis, read the  publisher's review above for that.<br />Yes, I agree that there are a lot of  names to keep track of. Yes, it can be very confusing. This is not a  potboiler, a beach book, a book to skim through while you watch tv or  listen to the radio. This book requires concentration and thought. But it  rewards such reading with a fabulous tale of the macabe and  mysterious.<br />There are things left unresolved. I was somewhat dismayed at  parts of the ending, as there were issues that were dealt with differently  than I would ahve expected. But I loved the various references to  Lovecraft, and other mythological beings. All in all I was pleased that I  bought this book, and will consider re-reading it down the road (when I'm  sure I'll discover even more I missed the first time.)	2000-06-03

The experieces that the characters have are real. The lives they live are real. The feelings they have are real indeed. This book plumbs the depths of female  to female relationships, and the result is so close to the bone that it  hurts.<br />I won't synopsize the plot, others have done so and you can read  it above as well. What I will say is that this is an illuminating book, a  difficult book, a sometimes contrived book. I felt that Mattison put her  finger directly on the pulse of how some women are friends and how they  relate to each other. I felt she was able to express the way loss can touch  us endlessly, long past when we should be &quot;over it&quot;. I also found  the manner in which she wrote the book seemed artificial at first, but the  reasoning came clear as I read. It started out difficult, and got more  absorbing and easier as I went along.<br />The long and the short of it is,  this is not a mind candy potboiler beach novel, this is a book which will  take attention and effort, but will reward those with illumination and  feeling. If you're willing to make the effort, then buy this book, if not,  pass it by.	2000-05-31

I am using this book, in conjunction with &quot;Eat Right For Your Type&quot; by Dr. Peter D'Adamo, and seeing wonderful results! The premise is simple: certain foods make certain people's bodies react in ways which  cause them to gain and retain weight. Some of these reactions are food  allergies, some are food sensitivities. If you determine which foods cause  reactions for your particular body, and stop eating them, you'll be amazed  at what happens!<br />I am following these two programs (they go together very  well) under the supervision of my doctor. I have stopped eating  wheat/gluten products and dairy, and having done so am quite pleased with  the results. In only two weeks I have lost six pounds and 2% of my body fat  (I have a scale which measures both). My clothes are much looser (I should  have measured myself before starting), a long term health issue is clearing  up and going away, and I feel terrific! <br />I will note that I did not do  the juice fast part of the elimination diet suggested in this book as one  of the ways to determine food sensitivites. As someone with hypoglycemia,  and having tried juice fasts before and had problems, I knew that was not  the right route for me. But I did use the &quot;Sensitive Seven Elimination  Diet&quot;, and have had great results! <br />If you're willing to make some  real changes in your eating habits, in exchange for real and measurable  changes in your life, don't hesitate, buy this book. It's full of great  information which can help you lose the weight you're hoping to.	2000-05-28

This book is an excellent companion to the original &quot;Eat Right 4 Your Type&quot; book by D'Adamo (see my review on that book here on Amazon.) It contains a review of some of the material from the original book, and then  branches out to include a ton of recipes. Each recipe specifies whether it  is beneficial, neutral, or to be avoided by each blood type, making it easy  to plan meals for one or more types.<br />The book has a whole range of  recipes, from breads to main dishes, sauces to desserts, salads to  beverages. There are 30 day menu plans for each blood type, with suggested  meals and snacks. There's even a list in the back of mail order sources for  various foods some people may have trouble finding in their areas.<br />All  in all this book is a great adjunct to the previous book, and well worth  buying for those who follow this health plan. If you're using the first  book, don't hesitate to buy this book!	2000-05-28

I am currently seeing a holistic doctor who recommended this book to me. I have been following the plan for two weeks now, and am seeing marvelous results. I have lost six pounds. I have had a chronic health problem clear  up. I have lost the food cravings which were driving me crazy. I have more  energy. And my hormone levels seem to be balancing out!<br />Mind you, this  program is not necessarily easy to follow. The fast food lifestyle that  most Americans follow is deeply ingrained in many of us, and can be hard to  give up. Processed foods are everywhere, convenient, and simple to grab and  eat when you're hungry. This plan requires some planning, some thought, and  a dedication to finding organic produce and meats (I'm a Type O). But if  you're willing and able to do so, the benefits are terrific!<br />I have one  small quibble with the book. D'Adamo suggests the use of Ezekial or Essene  breads for Type Os, but my doctor tells me they contain gluten, so I avoid  them. I would also recommend that people with sugar cravings avoid  chocolate altogether, as it makes it harder to get past those if you still  eat it. <br />All in all though, this is a fantastic book, and the companion  book, &quot;Cook Right For Your Type&quot; is a wonderful addition to this  plan. If you're willing to follow through, this concept can change your  life for the better!	2000-05-28

The author goes beyond just recipes (although those alone are worth the price of the book!) to give us a whole lot of intersting and important information. This book caters to those with celiac  disease, and there is a whole section of questions and answers in the front  which addresses a number of relevant issues for those dealing with celiac  and related diseases.<br />That being said, the best part about this book are  the recipes! Hagman covers everything from soup to nuts. The ingredients  are, for the most part, readily available at your grocery or health food  store. There is a large section on breads, both rice-based and rice-free.  She includes directions for making bread by hand or using several sizes of  breadmakers. There are also some which omit eggs and dairy, a nice plus for  those with additional sensitivities.<br />All in all this is a terrfic book,  one which can liberate those dealing with wheat and gluten allergies,  allowing us to &quot;eat like the rest of the world.&quot; Don't hesitate!	2000-05-27

There is a whole section devoted to menus, to help you plan a meal around the foods in the  book. There are several wonderful appendices, including one on wheat flour  equivalents, hidden sources of wheat, baking with dairy substitutes, and  mail order sources for some of the more obscure ingredients used.<br />My only  quibble with this book is that it does use a fair amount of sugar (although  brown, rather than white) in some recipes, which is not as healthy as it  might be. But the author has another book which addresses this issue:  Special Diet Solutions - Healthy cooking without wheat, gluten, dairy,  eggs, yeast or refined sugar.<br />All in all this is a marvelous book for  anyone who is dealing with a wheat or glueten food allergy or sensitivity.

This is a nice example of the genre (although I must say Stephen King is the master, and Dobyns, while good, is nowhere near King at his best.) The plot was interesting, although somewhat scattered. The characters were  rather uneven, some developed well, some left hanging so that one wondered  about their motivations at times. The atmosphere was ok, the whole book was  ok, although I don't know if I'd buy it in hardback unless I was a huge fan  of his.<br />I haven't read The Church of Dead Girls, so I don't know if this  is better or worse or what. I assume that one is better, based on other  reviews here and on the back of the book. All in all I'd say, a fair read,  but not a fabulous one.	2000-05-25

This is a really interesting book. I began reading  it just as I started  working with a holistic doctor here where I live. Many of the things she  suggested are things Haas mentions in his book.<br />I've been following a  food elimination diet for over a week now, and am amazed at how my food  cravings (especially those for sugar and chocolate) have gone away. This is  not an easy process to follow, I'll warn you of that up front.<br />To start  with, the elimination diet has you giving up what he calls the Sensitive  Seven: Most Commonly Reactive Foods: Dairy, Wheat, Corn, Sugar, Soy, Eggs,  Peanuts. Cutting those seven things out of a diet is very hard to do  without some real planning and committment. But once you do so, the  benefits are tremendous. Problems that had been plaguing me for years have  gone away, simply by cutting out all gluten (wheat and other  gluten-containing grains) and dairy out of my diet.<br />I do suggest that you  follow this, or any major diet change, under the supervision of a doctor.  The most stringent elimination diet Haas recommends is five or more days of  juice fasting, which is fine for some people, but would be difficult for  people with blood sugar issues like diabetes or hypoglycemia. So check with  your doc first.<br />That being said, the advice in this book is, for the  most part, excellent, and sure to help those who are dealing with food  sensitivities and allergies which keep them from losing weight.	2000-05-23

I read Dune when it was first published, have been reading SF for over 30  years in fact. This book, being written by someone other than Frank  Herbert, is bound to disappoint anyone who made their way through the first  series. To write a prequel to, arguably, one of the best SF novels of all  time, is a very ambitious idea, and one which suceeds only partially.<br />Some problems include: lack of character development on some levels; too  much focus on Harkonnen cruelty and torture (if I want to read about  Hannibal Lecter, I'll read Thomas Harris, thank you); an unfortunate use of  women mostly as flat, one-dimensional characters; and so on.<br />There are  some good parts: I liked the background we're given on Duncan's childhood,  I liked the exploration into Ix and the Guild, I liked the peek into Leto's  parent's relationship, I liked the exploration of Shaddam's relationship  with Fenring.<br />All in all though, the writing style is just too far from  Frank Herberts to make this book match. I read it all the way through, but  don't know that I'd go back to it again and again, as I did with the  original series. Buy it and read it if you're a Dune fan, but don't expect  it to be something it's not.	2000-05-23

They require some effort to read, they're not mind candy. That being said, once you make the effort, you are well rewarded. In this her latest, Tepper gives us an intricate  weaving of ecological concerns, feminism, fantasy, suspense, science  fiction, all woven together into a wonderful tale of a young woman who, in  finding her power, finds herself.<br />I do think this is one of those books  that, if you can, you should try to read all in one sitting. It's somewhat  hard to keep all the threads together if you break it up into pieces. But  that just speaks to the complexity of the material. I really enjoyed the  book, especially as it built towards the climax at the end, and there were  parts that literally had my spine tingling and hair rising up on my head (I  love it when a book does that) from eager anticipation.

I really like this book. Dreyer has given us a book which delineates the affects that our astrological sun signs have on our health and well-being, on several levels. She explains the various influences of the planets (and  does cover rising and moon signs a bit), and coordinates them with  suggestions for shoring up areas of weakness and dealing from  strengths.<br />I especially like her inclusion of the East Indian Ayurvedic  doshas (there are three, Pita, Vatta, and Kapha) and how they correlate  with the western astrological information. She gives practical suggestions  on diet, exercise, meditation, herbs, supplements, and behavioral  modifications to help bring yourself into better balance and good health.

I am a traditionally trained Reiki Master Teacher. I read Petter's book with an open mind, and while I feel his heart is in the right place, his book has a number of inaccuracies which made it not one I would recommend  to anyone seeking to learn more about Reiki.<br />For example:<br />  - On page  15, Petter states: &quot;Technically speaking, Reiki is one of many methods  that are part of the Chinese family of Qigong...&quot;<br />This is COMPLETELY  incorrect. Reiki is not Qigong, and Qigong is not Reiki. Both are forms of  energy, true, but they are completely distinct from each other.<br />  - On  page 71, Petter states: &quot;I have repeatedly stated that Reiki is energy  pure and simple. It has nothing to do with religion, astrology, New Age,  psychology, personal growth, channeling, bodywork, or even healing for that  matter.&quot;<br />This is also wrong. Reiki is ALL about healing!  It is  also about personal growth. Reiki exists for us to heal ourselves and  others, it enables us to grow and help others grow. I don't understand his  stance here at all.<br />This being said, the book contains some interesting  information, and some nice exercises. I do appreciate that fact that Petter  reiterates that Reiki must be learned from a teacher (one simply cannot  learn it from a book, video, or over the internet) and that attunements  (initiations) must be done in person.<br />The bottom line is, if you are  interested in learning more about Reiki, find a Master/Teacher near you  with which to work. Or, try the following books:<br />Reiki - Universal Life  Energy  Bodo Baginski and Shalila Sharamon  ISBN  0-940795-02-7<br />Reiki -  Hawayo Takata's Story  Helen J.

I had a friend who worked on  a fishing boat out of Wanchese, NC (who is now deceased) and can well  believe the tale told in this book, based on what I've heard and  seen.<br />Junger tells the stories of the lives of the men who disappeared  during that fateful storm, and gives us insight as to what it might have  been like to live those lives and die that kind of death. My only quibble  is that his writing, despite the subject, seems a bit dry and removed in  spots, this is due, no doubt, to his striving for accuracy and realism.  Despite that, this book is a roller coaster ride, one I won't forget, and  which captures the benign malevolence of the Atlantic Ocean.	2000-05-01

They're two little pigs who are as different as night and day, yet at their centers, they are both alike. These two charming piggies and their adventures can be looked at from many levels. At the surface, this is a charming story of one pig  who loves to travel, and one who loves staying home. Look deeper and you  see metaphor upon metaphor, themes of universal truths regarding looking  beyond the external and seeing the fact that we are all one in spirit.<br />My children love the use of postcards to tell the stories of the travels  of Toot, all the more so because we collect postcards ourselves. For them,  the best part is when Toot comes home, and lies snug in his bed next to  Puddle. After all, there's really no place like home.	2000-04-30

I have used various kinds of divinatory cards for almost 30 years now, and these are the ones I turn to the most when I need to ask my subconcious a question. These cards, as Tarot cards, are tools we use to tap into the  depths of ourselves in order to see where we are going, why we are where we  are, or what we will do in regards to certain situations.<br />All people have  the ability to &quot;know their future&quot;, it's simply a matter of  tuning into the knowledge we all have buried within us. Cartouche cards are  tools we can use to access this information and use it to better our own  lives.

Throughout we can follow strands of pagan magick,  bright threads of Italian cooking, the poignant theme of thrwarted lovers,  and the brilliance of the world of art through which this novel moves.<br />The variety of names and characters does get a bit confusing at times,  but I did not find it detracted from my enjoyment of the book.

This book is the first one I turn to when I am dealing with any illness or problem with my, or my family's health. I am a mother, with two small children, and I love being able to take control of my own and my children's health needs, rather than being dependant on a doctor to tell me what I  should do (especially when I don't always agree!).<br />This book is packed  with over 600 pages of information, listing various disorders  alphabetically for easy reference. It provides information for treating  various illnesses with nutrition, vitamins, and herbs. It has a separate  section detailing various suppliments and their effects on the system. It  explains the various disorders, and offers alternatives to conventional  &quot;allopathic&quot; medical treatments for same (that being said, please  be sure to check with your doctor before enbarking on any suppliment or  herbal treatment). <br />As with any exhaustive reference of this size, there  are a few inaccuracies here and there, but most of those are minor and have  been corrected from previous editions. All in all this is an invaluable  book for anyone who wishes to take control of their own health, and to use  vitamins and herbs wisely and with substantial positive results. Don't  hesitate, buy it!	2000-04-30

This book is a thorough guidebook for getting in touch with your personal angels. It's not an easy process, it takes work and dedication, but the benefits can be clearly felt and many. I always know when I've found a book that is valuable to me when I look back at it some years later and find  lots of dog-eared pages, and that's certainly the case with my copy of this  book.<br />As with the other reviewer(s), I strongly suggest you read through  the entire book first to get an overview of the work to be done, and then  go through the process piece by piece. This is not a quick and dirty thing  you're trying, but a long and serious project. Don't approach it as  anything but. However, once gone through, the benefits are real and  substantial. Even if one didn't believe in angels, the grounding and  releasing exercises would be of real benefit.<br />Bottom line, buy this book  if you're willing to do the work on yourself to enable yourself to hear  your angels.	2000-04-30

This book is a welcome addition to Burnham's collection of stories of encounters with angels. After the success of her first book, &quot;A Book of Angels&quot;, the letters came pouring in, from all over, recounting even more angelic meetings.<br />I find reading both these books to be  enormously comforting. The stories they tell, from real people who've had  real experiences, reassure me that none of us is alone, that help is at  hand, and that no one need have fear. A touching and encouraging follow up  to her first book.	2000-04-30

I bought this book several years ago, just after my beloved grandmother died. I was heartbroken, and on the way to her funeral saw this book (and another on angels) in the airport bookstore. I bought it on impulse, and found it to be the perfect thing to read on the way to her funeral.<br />The  book is filled with stories of encounters with angels, stories that made  the hair on the back of my neck stand up, stories that made me weep,  stories that made me realize that despite death, all really was right in  the world, and that we were always surrounded by those who loved us,  guarded us, protected us, even if we couldn't see them. This book brought  comfort to me in a time of great sorrow, and I'll always be glad I bought  it.	2000-04-30

I really like this book. It sits on my bookshelf next to my two other favorite natural medicine books, the Balch &amp; Balch &quot;Prescription for Nutritional Healing&quot; and the &quot;Family Guide to  Homeopathy&quot; by Dr. Andrew Lockie. These three form the cornerstones by  which I monitor, guide, and protect the health of myself and my family.<br />Golan's book is less encyclopedic than the Balch &amp; Balch, and  focuses more on the roots of disease and disorders, both the physical roots  as well as the mental and emotional ones. His book is truly  &quot;holistic&quot;, he sees the human entity as a whole, and understands  that we are all like giant mobiles; if one aspect of our lives is out of  balance, it throws the others off as well.<br />The book is easy to read,  thorough, and, for the most part, the suggestions of changes to make are  practical and relatively easy to do (for most of us). It's an excellent  resource for anyone who wishes to take control of their health and their  life, and I recommend it highly.	2000-04-30

I have a number of books on Feng Shui, and this is easily the most accessible. It is written clearly, provides concrete examples, and the reasoning behind doing certain things is explained properly. In other books  I have on the subject, a lot of time is spent dealing with the more arcane  aspects  of Feng Shui, which many of us do not need or want.<br />This book  is practical and easy to use, and its format allows one to walk around the  house carrying it and applying its suggestions without having to take  volumnous notes and study for days.  If you want to bring order to your  life, stimulate the flow of &quot;chi&quot; (energy) through your home, and  make it a happier, brighter place (and your life better at the same time),  this is the book to help you. It's sort of like &quot;Feng Shui for  Dummies&quot;, but better. Don't hesitate on this one, buy it!	2000-04-30

This book is primarily intended for the trained homeopath, not the layperson. It is an in-depth look at the more common homeopathic constitutional types. That being said, it's a fabulous book, filled with  excellent information that the author gleaned from years of work as a  homepath.<br />Bailey provides detailed information on 35 major types, giving  insight on diagnosis, mental and emotional traits, and physical  characteristics. This book should really only be used by a trained and  certified homeopath, but it does provide fascinating reading for us  laypersons. Great book!	2000-04-30

I bought this book sometime in the mid-80s, not long after Bantam published it. I was looking to take control of my life, to actively direct it, rather than swimming with the tide. This book allowed me to do just  that.<br />Gawain gives a number of excellent techniques to use to actively  direct the course of your own life. From spoken and written affirmations,  to &quot;treasure maps&quot;, all the information given is powerful, and  works! I still have a treasure map I drew about fifteen years ago, and  everything I visualized then has come to pass over the years. This stuff is  real, pure, simple magic that anyone can do.

It had a whole host of things I like in novels: strong female characters, realistic relationships between people, a look at early pagan religions and how they filter through the lives of people even  in the face of Christianity, and marvelous descriptions of Italian cooking!<br />I will concur with other reviewers that the extensive numbers of Italian  family names made it hard to track certain characters and parts of the  plot. But not excessively so, and it did not lessen my enjoyment of the  book. And I loved the recipes at the very end, a charming touch. All in  all, a good buy.	2000-04-30

I am one of those who believe strongly that what we think and say can have a profound impact on our lives and surroundings. We literally &quot;create our own reality&quot; by our thoughts, words and deeds. This book gives the  reader many tools to use to create the reality one wishes for, rather than  just swimming through life, tossing and turning with no control over  direction.<br />Regardless of whether one believes in spirit guides, the  information presented in this book can be used in everyday life. Changing  the way one thinks can change one's life. Roman gives a variety of  exercises which can be used to sense energy in the home and others, to use  one's personal energy to improve oneself, to improve relationships with  others, and to lead a clearer, more spiritual life. This is an excellent  book for anyone who wants to grow, emotionally and spiritually.	2000-04-30

There were parts that made me wince, there were parts that made me sad, there were parts that made me laugh out loud. You find yourself wanting to shake the protagonist, make him see some sense.  You find yourself wanting to talk to the characters, help them figure out  the messes they're in. You're drawn into the book, absorbed by the issues  and problems, swallowed by the circumstances that surround the two  lovers.<br />As a part-Irish American, married to an Irish-Canadian, I was  fascinated by the slice of Irish life presented in this book. The realities  of life for the Irish Travelers are so far different from those we  Americans experience! Hamill illuminates these people with an unflinching  glance at their lives (assuming his descriptions are true), and lets us see  how a dismal childhood can affect one's entire life.<br />All in all this book  is a great read. I found it hard to put it down, and when I did, I wanted  to be reading it to see what was going happen. It's not the most uplifting  book I've ever read, but certainly captures ones attention and holds it to  the bitter end.	2000-04-30

This book is primarily for those who row on water, rather than those who use an erg indoors, as I do. That being said it's a great book, crammed full of important and relevant information.<br />It has detailed tips on  improving technique, comprehensive explanations of what kind of training to  do to achieve a certain goal, description on how to write a training  program, and competiton strategies. It gets very specific in several areas  regarding strength, endurance, power, and how to increase all of these.  There are charts and graphs, diagrams and photos, the works!<br />I only wish  the author had given more focus to erg rowing, but even without that this  is an excellent resource for anyone who rows, whether on land or on the  water.	2000-04-30

I stand by my previous review, and wish to correct the previous reviewer who stated that &quot;all the amino acids in proteins can be found in all plant sources&quot;. This is *completely* wrong. And as Manager of the  Natural Medicine Forum on CompuServe for the past six years, I can speak  with some authority on this, and am far from being  &quot;rather  uneducated&quot;, as that reviewer stated. <br />The amino acid L-Carnitine  can ONLY be obtained from animal foods (see &quot;The Real Vitamin &amp;  Mineral Book&quot; by Lieberman &amp; Bruning for more details on this).  One cannot obtain L-Carnitine from vegetable sources. It can be synthesized  from them, but only if the body has enough vitamin c, niacin, vitamin B6,  iron, and the amino acid L-Lysine. And because cereal grains such as corn,  wheat and rice - mainstays of many vegetarian diets, are low in L-Lysine,  the vegetatian's ability to synthesize carnitine may be compromised. The  cooking of these grains destroys L-Lysine entirely.<br />So, I stand by my  original statement that the eating plan presented in this book, while  excellent for some, does not necessarily work for all, and some vegans may  experience a lack of certain essential amino acids, L-Carnitine being one,  as I did.	2000-04-15

He gives us a history of the company and the different types of pottery it created when it ran, and tonnes of photos of the various pieces still available to the collector today.

The authors provide  us a history of the potter and his work, with a number of historical  photos. There is an extremely useful section showing various marks  (backstamps) used, allowing one to identify and date pieces.

US	52643745	R148UO5S527WQF	0930625730	899058365	Pottery and Porcelain Ceramics Price Guide (Antique Trader's Pottery & Porcelain Ceramics Price Guide)	Books	4	16	16	N	Y	A nice effort, well organized...	This is a useful book. Many people tend to reach for the Kovels guides as a first resort, and I must admit I do so sometimes myself. But some of the more general guides they do are not as well organized as they could be.  This book is organized well, contains a relatively thorough listing of the  more common types of pottery and porcelain (although many of the more  obscure types are not listed at all). The pricing part, alas, has the same  problem that so many other reference books on collectibles deal with today,  that being the effect that online auctions have had on pricing. So it may  not reflect prices you'd see on Ebay or Amazon's auctions. But the prices  give one a baseline from which to work, and seem accurate with regards to  most markets. And the book is a convenient size to slip into your bag when  you go to an antique store or live auction.	2000-04-01

It has almost 300 pages of photos and illustrations of the popular collectable pottery made by Hall China of East Liverpool, Ohio. The Whitmyers give us a history of the pottery, a chart of color  swatches to use to compare to our collectibles, and an extensive treatment  of the various patterns and styles made over the years.<br />They cover the  various dinnerware patterns: Ruffled D-Shape, C&amp;D-Shape, E-Shape, the  classic Eva Zeisel Shapes, and the Century &amp; Tomorrow's Classic  Dinnerware. They cover the kitchenware patterns, the refrigerator ware, the  teapots and coffee pots, other products like the punch sets, and shed some  light on re-issues and new products.<br />All in all this is an exhaustively  thorough reference work, valuable for all, from dealer to novice. If you  love collecting Hall China, don't hesitate to buy this book!	2000-04-01

I must agree with several of the reviewers below. This is the book you hate to love. On the one hand, it has an exhaustive amount of information on the various Fiesta pieces available. On the other hand, the whole mixup  with regards to the medium green color is a real problem (plate #52 on page  43 was incorrectly captioned.) However the information provided makes up  for this problem, no question.<br />The book covers a history of the pottery,  including the famous &quot;radioactive red&quot;, it shows the four most  common backstamps, it describes ways to definitively identify Fiesta (as  opposed to some look-alikes), and gives explanations of the dating codes  and the various measurements.<br />As well, the book is chock-full of good  photos the various pieces in all their colorful glory. I especially like  the section on the Harlequin line, as it seems to be rising in  collectibility. The only other quibble I have is with the prices shown, but  that's a problem with every reference book out there these days, as the  online auctions have thrown everything for a loop. So if you're looking for  a good, general reference on Fiesta, this is the one to get.	2000-04-01

On the one hand, it has a number of photos of interesting items made of plastic over the years. On the other hand, it seems to be neither fish nor fowl nor good red meat. It's not complete  enough to be helpful as an exhaustive reference, nor specific enough to  cover just one area. It seems to be an overview, and makes us wish the  author focused more on one area.<br />Lindenberger looks at kitchenware a bit  more than other items, and then covers things found around the house, along  with a small section on children's items. The problem here is that the  topic is too vast, and trying to cover it in a book this small is too hard.  The book has some lovely photos of some interesting pieces, but it's just  not complete. And the prices do not reflect the effect that online auctions  have had on the market, and seem high in comparison. A nice try, which  could use some updating and additions.	2000-03-31

This book is filled to the brim with hundreds of pages of plastic ware from the 30s to the 60s. Goldberg gives us photos of everything from plastic toothpicks to appliances. He includes everything you can think of:  barware, bowls, canisters, cookie jars, clocks, containers, flatware,  glasses &amp; tumblers, napkin rings, picnic items, refridgerator dishes,  salt &amp; pepper sets, utensils, even watering cans!<br />There is a large  section which covers dinnerware, with over 25 different manufacturers,  including a nice section showing various backstamps. He includes a  bilbliography, value guide (which may not reflect current online auctions  prices), and a short history of plastic as it was introduced to America. My  only quibble with this book is that I wish the photos were a little better  lit, they are a little dark in some sections. But all in all, a valuable  reference.	2000-03-31

Mashburn writes great books, no question about it. This particular postcard guide focuses on fantasy postcards, which are a particular favorite of mine. He coveres all the basics: fairies, nursery rhymes,  dressed animals, mermaids, teddy bears, Santas, Krampus, nudes, death  fantasies, Halloween, Hold-To-Light, and a whole host of other types of  weird and wonderful subjects.<br />As well, Mashburn gives us a comprehensive  history of postcards and collecting, covering the seven eras of postcards.  He discusses the various types, how to date them, grade them, and value  them. Since the book was written in '96, his prices do not always reflect  current online auction prices, but that's understandable. My only real  quibble with this book is that after reading through it and looking at the  many black and white illustrations I only wanted to go out and buy more  cards! A wonderful book, don't hesitate.	2000-03-28

This book is a gem! It's full of history and lore related to the sea and those who sail upon it. It has over a hundred pages of interesting information regarding the derivation of words and phrases used in everyday  speech. My husband was raised on the seacoast of Nova Scotia, and I've  spent many summers on the coast of North Carolina, so we are no strangers  to the sea and sailing. This book made a perfect gift for him this past  Christmas.	2000-03-26

It is arranged alphabetically, in encyclopedia form, and contains over 500 pages of entries. Every single obscure character is listed (remember who Lord Tarva was?), descriptions of places, ages,  weaponry, even philosophers who had an impact on the author and the book  are discussed and explained.<br />This book is a wonderful resource for those  who are writing research papers on Narnia, or for those of us who just love  the world and like to expand our grasp of Narnian trivia.

I was not at all displeased with this book (as the two previous reviewers were.) I find it full of interesting information about a number of names I know (including Haggarty.)

But I must agree with other reviewers here that this book is far below the quality of her earlier work. I loved the original Copper Crown series, they were vivid and engaging.  This book is so obviously and painfully autobiographical that it's quite  hard to read.<br />I sympathize with what she's been through. And I know  writers are supposed to &quot;write what you know&quot;. But this was too  much for most of us, we don't want to share this stuff. Let Jim go  Patricia, and get on with your life. We'd like to read more excellent  fiction the like of which we know you're capable of, but this, sadly, just  isn't it.	2000-03-26

It is chock-full of information on the various photographic processes of the early 19th century. It takes us from cased images (daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes) to photography on paper  (calotypes, wet plates, albumen prints, cartes de viste, cabinet cards,  sterographs) to late 19th century processes (dry plate, silver prints,  platinum prints) and has a special section on US Civil War images.

It's a definitive reference on the somewhat obscure subject of Victorian Trade Cards, but for those of us who love them, it's a feast. It is crammed with illustrations, broken into categories, and contains history and collecting tips. The pricing information is somewhat  out of date, due to the impact that online auctions have had on these  collectables (some are more expensive, some less, as  auctions make them more available.) If you're at all a fan of this genre,  don't hesitate to buy this book!	2000-03-26

This is an excellent reference book for those who seek scientific information on mammals of the northern Midwest. It contains an entire section which covers the various environments in this area, the geology  past and present, the soils, climate, vegetation, and the influence of  human beings on the ecology.<br />The book also has a wonderful section on  the animals themselves, with a page devoted to each creature, complete with  scientific name, habitat map, photograph or line drawing of the animal,  distribution, written description, natural history, and in many cases  additional reference suggestions. It is a very thorough and complete book,  well researched and presented.	2000-03-26

This excellent field guide is invaluable for those of us who live in the northern part of the Midwest. It covers the many types of habitats we enjoy here, and the plants, animals and birds found in them. The book is full of  vivid pen and ink drawings showing samples of the variety of wildlife which  abound here. It is extensive enough to provide throrough information, yet  small enough to tuck into a backpack on a camping trip. It's a wonderful  value and a fascinating read. Go for it!	2000-03-26

The first gives us a list of first names currently in use in Ireland and their history and meaning. It is moderately thorough, and contains a number of names which are not Celtic in  their roots. The second section covers some of the more common family names  in use in Ireland, with black and white pictures of the crests. A  pronunciation guide would have been helpful, but is lacking.

It is very specific: a book to teach you how to use Reiki to change your core beliefs about abundance and lack. It is NOT a book designed to teach you about Reiki itself. Reiki cannot be learned from  a book (Diane Stein's teachings notwithstanding, see my Amazon.com review  of her book.) It IS a book to teach those who are already Reiki  practitioners to use Reiki to change their lives.<br />All too many of us  carry negative beliefs about money and our right to abundance. Many of us  were taught that money is &quot;bad&quot;, that only those who are not  spiritual will have abundance. What nonsense! Spirit wishes us to live life  with abundance, it is our birthright (see Lee Carroll's Kryon books for  more info on this topic.) Horan's book provides a step-by-step program  which, if followed, will disolve blockages in your life and allow the  natural abundance of the universe to flow through it.<br />I followed the  program, and the changes in my life were amazing. Not overnight, but  substantial nonetheless. The most important part was the change in my  mental attitude, and how my life flowed from that. If you are already a  Reiki practitioner who wants to change their life, buy this book! If you're  interested in learning more about Reiki, find a good Master/Teacher in your  area and seek training from them. A teacher is vital, you cannot learn it  alone. But once learned, the changes in your life will astound you! I have  been praticing Reiki since 1994, and have been a traditionally trained  Master/Teacher since 1998. Feel free to email me for more info on this book  or Reiki in general.	2000-03-26

Linn goes over a variety of techniques for clearing and upgrading the energies of a home; from Feng Shui to smudging to cleansing with sound, light, and color.<br />She includes several informative sections on things like the numerology  of homes (which I find fascinating), includes a Ba Gua map for your Feng  Shui use, talks about tomems and various household  protection rituals. I  have the bad habit of dogearing pages which are important to me in a  reference book, and her book must have thirty or more turned down, that's  how valuable I find the info within.

I have a number of books on Feng Shui, and while I'll admit this is not the most comprehensive, it certainly is full of practical information which I refer to. The author goes into a lot of detail with regard to the various room shapes and house shapes which I found helpfull. There are lots of  illustrations which show the flow of chi and its effects.<br />But the most  interesting thing about this book is, when I followed her instructions  regarding the placement of furniture in my husband's home office, the  effect was almost immediate, and profound! My husband was looking for a job  at that time, and had been through several interviews, but nothing definate  had happened. I had just gotten this book, and after reading it, completely  re-arranged the office. Within an hour of doing so, my husband got not one,  but two job offers over the phone! I don't believe in coincidences, and  think this made a definite difference. My advice is, try it, you might like  it.	2000-03-24

This book is an excellent introduction to the very complicated subject of eastern astrology. Most Northern Americans have no desire nor need to delve into the esoterics of same, and this book serves us well. Lau provides insightful looks at the lunar signs, explains the impact of the five  elements, cross-references with western astrology, and gives the layperson  a wonderful overview.<br />I find her yearly predictive blurbs to be short,  but for the most part, accurate. I find the character descriptions to be  spot on, and consult her book when I meet someone new I am curious about.  All in all this is a well-written book which would make a very nice  addition to anyone's library of new age material.	2000-03-24

I've had results with  homeopathic remedies that were practically miraculous! They are safe,  inexpensive, easy to use even for small children, and quickly effective.

It's not always easy to read her books, they're not the &quot;mind candy&quot; I sometimes like when I'm not willing to work with an author. Her writing requires work,  attention, concentration. Often whole chapters can be used to describe a  single incident, whole books cover just one week, or day.  But there's  always action for those parts that require it, it's not all philosophy and  tea. I just enjoy an author who refuses to dumb down her work, and makes us  use our brains a bit, while expanding what we think and how we perceive  things.<br />This latest installment in the Atevi series should be read after  the other three, otherwise it will be harder to understand a lot of the  background.

I was religious about it. I calculated blocks, I got very scientific about meals, and in the end found it just too hard for an ordinary housewife with kids and a husband to  keep up with. It's a tremendous amount of work to get things figured out,  and while I'm sure if I were single I'd find it easier, I just plain didn't  have time. And I didn't lose more than about 8 pounds while I was following  it to the letter, so I'm not convinced of its effectiveness.

As it was, I found it almost impossible to get  through the day without some form of carbos, and I'm not talking needing  big dishes of ice cream, even a simple bowl of rice would have been  welcome! As well, I found the lack of fiber in this diet to be a real  drawback, and the suggestion to use things like Metamucil and take large  quantities of vitamins to be unrealistic.

The layout is great, the organization is easy to understand, the pictures are, for the most part, clear. I sympathize with the reviewer below who had trouble with some of  the marks being off with regards to dates, but in my mind, that does not  detract too much from the usefullness of this book as a reference. I'd  recommend it.	2000-03-19

I wanted a reference work for literature, but I didn't want to pay $50 for one. This book gives short, concise blurbs, which is often all one needs. It is organized well  and is inclusive enough for the average household. Not a book for  specialists, but excellent for the layperson and student.	2000-03-19

She provides an extensive history of the topic, a good glossary, and the book is crammed full of excellent photos of a wide range of samples. The only problem with it is that the prices shown  do not reflect the influx of vintage valentines onto the various online  auctions sites, and so seem a bit high. Otherwise, it's quite a good buy.	2000-03-19

However I do find the layout of this book to be somewhat confusing. It's chock-full of good info, but needs better organization. Breaking things into topics and then alpahbetizing would work well, and  make the book that much more useful. But for the seasoned collector their  books are hard to do without.	2000-03-19

There are, perhaps, some mistakes, but given the volume of information here that is to be expected. I find I reach for this book first when I'm trying to identify a piece of this age group, and usually find  what I'm looking for here. Easy to travel with, from antique shop to  auction.

For the most part, they and I like it, but I must admit it takes a wee bit of getting used to. You won't be able to just put the tape on and walk away with this set, you'll need to sit with your kids and go through it together.

I bought this book for my 5 year-old who is now in Kindergarten. I was very impressed with the various ways in which it encourages young ones to practice their writing. It contains guides for each letter, rhymes, pictures to color geared to the letters, and best of all, pull-out cards to  use to review the process.

I bought this book, along with some others, for my 2nd grader this past winter. It contains the usual practice areas for writing the letters, as well as a poem on each page to copy, emphasizing the chosen letter. The best part is the pull-out practice cards which allow a youngster to review  the process of forming the letters by tracing with their fingers (a process  the Montessori method uses as well). An excellent resource for your child.	2000-03-11

I bought this book for my 5 year-old, who is in Kindergarten and working every day to practice her letters. The structure of the book is fine, but the overall size of the letters is much too large. Children at this stage are by now writing with pencils, and the size of these letters forces them  back to crayons. This might work for younger children who are unused to  pencils, but I honestly don't think a 3 year old needs to worry about  forming D'Nealian letters properly.

I bought this book a little over a month ago. It reads well. The theory seems sound. The plan is simple. But man, trying to swallow all the pills that are recommended is just too hard! I worked up to 3 grams a day of the &quot;stack&quot; of aminos the author suggests, and even though I am  practiced at  taking vitamins, it just got too hard to do! I was taking as  many as 15 or more pills per night, all at once, and it just wasn't  realistic. Perhaps if aminos came in 3 gram doses this would work, but for  now, with the highest I could find being 1 gram, it's just not reasonable  to expect the average person to be able to handle this volume. Too bad, as  I did like the ideas, just couldn't handle implementing them.	2000-03-11

Between my mother and I, we've been collecting postcards for over 40 years (we also sell them on Ebay). Mashburn's excellent reference is the first book we recommend to people who ask us for a reference on postcard  collecting.

I liked it, don't mistake me, but I felt that it was in some ways like looking at the world of Sayuri through a dark glass, or a layer of thin silk. She goes through many travails, but despite lengthy descriptions of her life, I  didn't feel pulled into it, quite. This may be due to the author being  male, and trying to describe the life of a very female woman, I'm not sure.  It was certainly full of much detail and description of the lives Geisha  lead, but I didn't ever really feel drawn into a depth of emotion for the  protagonist. It all seemed rather remote.	2000-02-12

I just re-read this book and have decided this is one of my favorites of  his. It has all the typical hallmarks of King's work: writing that flows  without being wordy, fabulous depth of characterization, unusual and  interesting plots, and enough spooky to make anyone look behind the closet  door after finishing this book late at night. I love King's ability to see  around the corner, to illuminate the weird side of life that is just on the  other side of normal. I love the way he writes, period. And in this book,  somewhat unusually, the good guys do win (although I don't want to get into  the whole abortion thing). Good triumphs over evil, and I like that when it  happens in his books. Worth a re-read if you haven't lately, and worth  buying if you've passed it by before.	2000-02-06

I am a traditionally trained Reiki Master/Teacher. I was initiually intrigued by Stein's book (despite the controversy it engenders). But I was sorry to discover that it is filled with inaccuracies, and contains a  mish-mash of information, some of which is false. I too was offended by the  overtly feminist tone. I was concerned by the addition of Chi Gung  techniques being portrayed as Reiki (I have taken Chi Gung classes myself).  I was dismayed at the idea that she promotes that one can attune oneself to  Reiki. Please be clear on this, one cannot attune oneself, and one cannot  receive attunements from a person who is not with you (distant attunements  do not work, period). Perhaps you are accessing energy if you do so, but it  is most assuredly NOT Reiki.<br />I do applaud the idea that Reiki should be  for everyone, as as a practitioner and teacher I try to work things out  with students and clients so that everyone can get the Reiki they need,  either through barter, sliding scales, or just plain gifts. <br />A  Master/Teacher I know explains Reiki like this: energy used for healing is  somewhat like radio waves. There are many kinds of energy, just as there  are many different bands on the radio. When you tune in a station on a  radio, some come in clearly, some come in faintly. Energy, Chi or Ki, is  like that as well. There are many types of healing energy, but only one  pure Reiki. I think it's marvelous that so many people desire to learn to  heal, but it's a process that is best done with a teacher and other  students to work with. I would never attune someone and then just leave  them alone, the bond between teacher and student is important, and  something that the student knows he or she can count on.<br />My advice for  anyone looking to learn Reiki is, find a reputable teacher, speak to other  of his/her students, find someone you can be comfortable with. Don't try to  learn something this important from a book, on your own.	1999-11-06

It has some valuable information in the beginning, such as how to determine the age of a card and so on, but her examples aren't as plentiful as one would  wish. As well, her prices aren't current, and having been published in  1990, cannot possibly reflect the kind of resurgance in interest in  postcards that places like Ebay and Amazon auctions are generating.

That being said, it has thousands of photos of various kinds  of postcards, well organized by subject (but I wish the reproduction were  clearer). The prices are dated, and do not reflect the impact that Ebay,  Amazon, and other online auction houses have had on postcard availability.

In it she tells the story of how two children go through the process of their parent's &quot;un-marriage&quot;, and come out the other side with everyone still ok  and things better than they were before. It would be a gentle way to  explain to children that divorce is NOT their fault, but in most cases is  just that the parents, who may still love each other, just need to live  different lives. The book is spiced up with Cole's usual terrific  illustrations, as well as cute text. A must-have for any family  contemplating this kind of step, or any Cole fan.	1999-06-16
