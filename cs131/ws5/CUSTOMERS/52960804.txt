Who else but JAK, could construct a mystery around antique mirrors?  And she pulls it off quite well.  If there were a couple of points Ms. Krentz missed on--such as the fact the heroine's half sister sleeps with the hero, and the reason we are given as to why the murderer hangs around at the end--she more than makes up for it with her snappy dialogue.  As usual the romance was warm and believeable and the role of Leonora's grandmother was nicely done.  All around an enjoyable read.	2002-01-26

I rated Ms. Adair's first book, Kiss and Tell four stars, her second effort here rates only three.  I will give her top marks for hot sex scenes, she writes them steamy and wild.  However it would have been nice if their motivations had been more believeable.  It was a real stretch of imagination to have Kyle and Delanie doing all that they did and frankly, Delanie was quite annoying most of the time.  This wasn't a bad effort but a bit of a disappointment after Ms. Adairs first book.  Most of the humor that marked the first effort was missing here as well.	2002-01-10

His protagonist, Alex McKnight is a likeable fellow with some problems stemming from his years as a cop, yet he doesn't slip down into the complete abyss, causing himself and the reader to become depressed.  Alex is intelligent, funny and has a chivialrous streak that is endearing.  Hamilton has written a well paced mystery that reads fast, his characters are beliveable and interesting, the dialogue snappy, intelligent and often humorous.  All in all, a winning combination.	2001-12-05

This one is no exception. With this being the thirteenth installment of the Dallas/Roarke series, you might naturally expect some drop off in intensity, not quite come up to snuff, but that just never happens. Ms. Roberts doesn't disappoint at all. In each new book she delves deeper into the backgrounds that inspire the motivations of Eve and Roarke. As an added bonus we are treated to some of the hottest, most passionate love scenes...and they're married! Every book in this series is marked with great dialogue, but this one bumps up the humor as well.  The Peabody/McNab 'mating dance' is hilarious.	2001-09-04

There were some things I truly liked about this book and some things that I found bothersome.  First to the good--I love Ms. Lowell's male characters (female are good too), she really has strong, self-reliant, take-care-of-business type males.  The indtroduction of Rarities Unlimited works as a strong base for future books.  Another area Ms. Lowell is very strong in, is her action scenes, all were well done in my opinion.  I did read another review where someone stated they didn't like all the dialogue.  I would have to disagree on that point, I believe Lowell writes great dialogue.  Some things I didn't like were as others have stated, the introduction of characters that really in no way seemed to further the plot.  I found that to be very distracting.  Another bug-a-boo for me, and this is just my opinion...It took a long, long time for the hero and heroine (and this is supposed to be a 'romantic' suspense)to get together.  Where as I thought the subject of illuminated manuscripts was novel and interesting at first, there were parts that became bogged down a little too much in details for my taste.    <br />As an aside I think some of Lowells best work was her collaberation with her husband on the Fiddler and Fiora series.  They might be hard to find but worth the effort.	2001-06-28

It doesn't matter if Mr. Coben is writing in his Myron Bolitar series or writing a stand alone, the result is the same.  A well written story with a fast pace, twisting plot and dynamite ending.

I thought this book was up to the standards set by Ms. Evanovich.  True some of the other books may have had more moments of out and out humor, but this one I felt gave us a lot of interaction between Steph and Morelli.  A lot more than in previous books.  I think Steph is growing in each new installment as are the rest of the more major characters.  My only moment of anxiety came with the last line of the book.  Once again Ms. Evanovich has left us hanging, which I know is a great marketing tool but the fact that we now have to wait a whole year is more than a little frustrating!  I would recommend this series to just about anyone who likes to read-and I truly envy anyone who has not read them and would now get to sit down and start with One For the Money and go on to Seven Up.  A Stephanie Plum feast...what fun!	2001-06-22

This is the first book of Ms. Adair's that I have read and I am ready to start the next.  I am always thrilled to find an author to put on my 'to read list'.  What struck me first about this book was the humor.  Marnie has just the right touch with Jake, a definite tough guy-loner.  The book reads fast and is packed with just about anything a person might want--humor, action, strong characters, hot sex scenes and good dialogue.  I hope Ms. Adair plans to write books on Marnie's brothers, they each sound interesting.  There is an excerpt of her next work in the back and after reading it I can only hope it is out already, because I'm hooked.	2001-06-18

The island is portrayed as somewhere I would like to visit.

My heart ached at the beginning for the young Amiranth.  The use of flashback was extensive, yet very well done--not an easy task to pull off.

If you have never read a book from this series then do yourself a favor and start with the first one--you won't be sorry.  Through seven books Ms. Buchanan has been able to maintain a freshness, and vitality both for her stories and her protaganist, Britt Montero.  Buchanan gives us enough of the personal side of Britt so that you feel involved in her life yet that personal side never overshadows the mystery or suspense of the story.  Miami is revealed in all her glory, beauty, edginess and sometimes violent ways.  This was a great book and another in a great series.	2001-06-02

I think the motto for the town this story takes place in should be &quot;Share and Share Alike'.  Most everyone seemed to be quite accepting of switching partners as long as it was for the right reasons.  I am not a prude, but this had elements that left me uncomfortable. The fact that the main character Nell has a one night stand with Riley, then falls for Gabe yet no one seemed to think this odd.  It is not the one night stand that bothers me--it's the fact Riley and Gabe are cousins--just seemed icky to me.  Not to mention that Suze's heartache came from the fact that her husband cheats on her yet she had been the 'other woman'too.  It felt hypocritical of Suze to then leave her husband for the same situation she had caused, an earlier wife of Jack's.  Rather than feeling sympathy for Suze, I really felt she got a taste of her own medicine.  Then Suze ends up falling for someone that her best friend Nell has slept with.  Again, nobody thought this odd.  Some other reviewer mentions the hot sex scenes, I didn't think the scenes between Nell and Gabe were very hot--it could have been because they were so irriating to one another.  Lest you think I hated the book, let me say I did not.  The opening scene was very funny, Ms. Crusie's humor is appreciated.  And I did like the scene when everyone gangs up on Nell's ex.	2001-05-28

Ms. Osborne definitely knows how to tug the heart strings.  She writes of two very different women and makes them into characters you come to really like and care about.

Rozan's painting of the setting of Hong Kong from the weather, food and people, places you smack in the middle of that city.  The story is complex and interesting and never fails to entertain.  For those familiar with the duo of Lydia Chin and Bill Smith, Rozan keeps the sexual tension building.

There is not a sexier, more dynamic couple than Roarke and Eve, and guess what?  They're married!  An important point about this series is that it is not just a romance.  Ms. Roberts (aka. J. D.

Having read all of Ms. Andersen's books I find I truly like her style of writing.  The premise of the story is not completely original...bad boy meets good girl etc.  But that's really why we buy romance books anyway.

While this book was more entertaining than a lot of books out there, it does not live up to the normal high standards set by Mr. Connelly himself.  To me the mark of an outstanding book is one in which I feel frustrated if I have to put it aside to do other normal daily activities.  This book did not meet that criterion.  If the book had disappeared for some reason before I'd finished it I would not have cared much.  I too did not find it reasonable for McCaleb a seasoned, experienced former agent to fall so easily into believing the worst of Bosch.  I would recommend Connelly's earlier works if you want to read truly excellent writing.	2001-02-26

In this book the hero and heroine weren't at each others throats as in the afore mentioned S. F.  Could there have been more romance/steam?  Yes.

This is due solely to my own prejudice.  This book is very dark in it's tone and of course subject matter.  I am drawn more towards tales with a brighter if not happier ending.  Lehane does such a masterful job of showing the pain and struggle of his characters and the circumstance of their lives you can't help but be entranced.  When he writes about Jimmy's feelings about his Katie's death I wept.  My problem (and I do mean my prejudice) is I saw no hope for these characters.  Absoulutely no one was happy.  For this reason I felt a sort of depression when I was done reading.  For me personally that is not how I like to feel when I finish a book.  I can find no fault with Lehane's writing, so if you don't mind the bleakness, this book would be five stars.	2001-02-06

However I would caution anyone who picks up this book with the intent of finding a story deeply engrossing, mature or politically correct.  I on the other hand like the occaisional frivolous, airy, fast-and-easy to read book.  L.A. Dead fits those requirements.  One thing I would like to express to Mr. Woods---Barrington's charm is the way he likes (and does)sleep with every female he comes in contact with, therefore don't ever let him get married again.

In the begining at the mention of infanticides I wanted no mercy and did not understand the mercy with which Butch and Marlene viewed these incidences.  However by the end of the book though not quite as liberal as these two on the subject I did feel there were two sides to the story.  I like the development of Lucy and it's good to have Marlene back in the courtroom.  I don't want to give anything away as to plot so let me just say the reaction to the killer at the end seemed unbelieveable to me. But this is a minor criticism.  If you have not read this series I would start at the begining, you will appreciate the characters all the more.

The book started well, though there was no 'mystery' as to who was behind all the mayhem.

Ms. Brown wants you to believe Chief (actually thats a third item I didn't like, that name for an American Indian character)falls for both sisters--I thought that was creepy.

And of course because they are so different they come to bond, each giving to the others just what is needed.  Ms. Osborne gives a vivid account of the time period (the Alaskan gold rush)and she is very humorous as well.

Being an avid fan of the 'Prey' series this book was a bit of a disappointment.  I have read the two previous Kidd books and liked them better than this one as well.  I kept expecting something more to happen here.  I would agree with other reviewers about the characters not being as well drawn as they could have been.  The most I can say is this is not a bad book but neither will you stay up late to finish it either.  A luke-warm review for a luke-warm book.  &lt;Ree-views&gt;	2000-11-16

Elizabeth Lowell)that I had read and it's still one of my favorites.  I've read it four times.  Her characters are very well drawn, the dialogue is crisp, plenty of action and it is romantic without being mushy.  It is a &quot;romance&quot; book I think a man would enjoy.  I would also recomend Ann Maxwell's &quot;Tell Me No Lies&quot;. &lt;Ree-views&gt;	2000-11-03

I have a couple of sticking  points that bothered me however.  One was how vicious the FBI treats Jack  at the end.  It was way over the top in my opinion and the bit about the  priest that makes an appearance towards the end is never really explained.   I don't want to add anything else that may spoil the book for anyone.   Aside from those two things I would recommend this book.  I like the  character of Jack Reacher, he always stays so calm and cool.  Definitely  worth the price. Ree-views	2000-09-02

I guess it speaks  well to the talent of Mr. Parker that even though his  heroine is not warm or very likeable he still manages to engross you  completely in the plot.  Read and enjoy this book for the mystery and prose  as there is not any characters you will feel drawn to.Ree-views	2000-08-19

I was a bit disappointed in this latest by Ms. Kellerman.  Her previous Decker/Lazurus books have been rich in characterzation,plot and the jewish  faith.  I felt this book lacked all these important traits.  I can  appreciate Ms. Kellerman going in a new direction with Cynthia, but given  that, I expected Cynthia to be more fully drawn.  I didn't feel the plot  was terrilbly exciting either.  This book wasn't horrible but neither did  it keep me awake nights wanting to finish it.  I would recommend all of the  previous books in this series if you would like to see just how fabulous  Ms. Kellerman can write. Ree-views	2000-08-17

The dialogue, tone and sexual encounters were grittier than you find in most romantic suspense.   If you are the hearts and flowers type this may not be for you but if you  like steamy and no-holds barred sex this was a great read.  Ree-views	2000-08-09

It has action, good dialogue, off center characters and reads very fast.  I would like to see Val back in  another book or two.  I like a hero who is extremely tough and can hold his  own against anyone yet still has a moral code and can still fall in love.  Ree-views	2000-08-09

I actually think it is one of her  best.  Her characters are strong without being irritating and her dialogue  natural and terrific.  If you have never read one of JAK's books try this  one and if you have read some of her more recent and wonder what the fuss  is about, try this and I think you will see why she is beloved in the  romance genre.	2000-08-02

Nor was I  expecting Ms. Garwood to do such a fine job of telling a suspense story.   Laurant was not wimpy and she did not do stupid things to put herself in  jeopardy as so many women do in these types of books.  I thought the  touches of humor were just right as was the romance.  I too would like to  see a book about Noah.  Well done Ms. Garwood.&lt;Ree-views&gt;	2000-08-02

Evanovich keeps you on the edge of your seat with the romantic tension as  well as the superbly crafted mystery and your side in stitches with the  hilarity.  You may not want to read this in bed if you have a partner as  you are sure to keep them awake with your laughter.  This book is a  fantastic read.&lt;Ree-views&gt;	2000-06-22

This is the type of book that you cannot put down yet when you read the last sentence you can't believe that it is over and it will be such an agonizingly long time till the next Crais book is out.  This has got to be  one of my top ten books of all time!  The plot is fast and interesting and  the characters superb!  There was nothing about this book that I didn't  like.  I am especially glad to have gotten the background on Pike, to know  why he is the way he is. It is going to be hard to wait for the next in the  Elvis Cole saga! Well done Mr. Crais!<BR>Ree-views	1999-07-07

It amazes me that an author (Dennis Lehane) can take characters (Patrick, Angie Bubba) and make them interesting, fresh and exciting even after five books.  You   want to continue to read about these characters book after book and I think  that is more difficult to accomplish than writing about different  characters each time.  The only problem is now having to wait a year for  the next book from Lehane.  Thank you for the great  entertainment!<BR>Ree-views	1999-07-07
