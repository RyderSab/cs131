This is a wonderful and touching story, about a small boy, named Willie Beech, who is evacuated from London to live in Little Weirwold with a complete stranger, Mr. Thomas Oakley. Tom  is an old man, not used to children (he had a baby bay that died, but that  was his only child), but he is kind to Willie. Willie is a deprived and  abused child, and he is afraid of everything, because he wasn't let outside  much in his earlier life. Slowly, Willie starts to think on his own, and he  forgets the hate and despair of his past. Tom comes to love Willie like a  son. Then a telegram comes, and Willie must return to his abusive mother in  London, but weeks pass and Willie doesn't come back, so Mr. Tom goes to  London to try to find the boy he has come to love so much.

Thet's right, a  sorcerer. His name is Lord Voldermort.Harry's mom was a with and his dad  was a wizard. The book is about Harry growing up with his uncle Vernun and  aunt Petuna Dursley, who never discuss harrys' mom and dad. The Dursleys  didn't even tell Harry how his mom and dad died.(The dursleys are motal, or  &quot;muggles&quot; as wizards call them.)When Harry is old enough, He  finds out about his past,and learns he is a wizard.From a letter that he  got from the famouse wizard and witch school, Hogwarts.The letter that he  is enrolled into Hoggwarts and his parents left him a lot of wizard  money.The story just begins there. The story follows into another two books  that are just as fascinating as the first one. I highlysuggest you read  this incredible book, and follow Harry' breath takeing adventure.	2000-05-11

This book is oriented for people below the age of 12. I believe this because of its dramatic intensity, explicity, and depressing ending. The story involves a navy  captain who is attempting to lead a team of scientists through various  radioactive plants. Their mission: to discover if in fact, radioactivity  will lead to Earth's immineant destruction. The officer's wife begains to  dissuade her husband from leading the expedition. However, fate intervenes  and the government appoints him for the perilous mission. As they embark,  each crew member will have to live in proximity 23 &quot;mates&quot;. The  main problem on the mission is that many of the crew members loathe each  other even more than the expedition. Shute does an excellent job at forming  mini-biographies surrounding each character involved in the expedition.  Shute revels facts as: Where they grew up, family, characteristics, and  numerous other obscure facts. Every integral character has a dramatic  presents in each chapter. Exposition is filled with wonderful discriptions  of each character and essence of story. Which leads me to the mext  paragraph. The narrative is very atmospheric. Atmospheric in the fact that  it highly corresponds to the Cold War confusion that plauged America in the  50's and 60's. Shute chooses a documentary style of writing to explain the  mission more explicitly. However, Shute aknowledges that spectacle alone  will never suceed, characters will! Shute's unabated intusiasm and boyant  persona endorsed the narrative to the fullest. In conclusion, this book is  a fascinating novel. If anyone chooses to explore and study character  development, should be forced to study &quot;On the Beach&quot;.	2000-05-11

It's a book about a black boy growing up with no father and an injured dog in a time of segregation.  I liked this book because it is a very emotional book.  To me, I felt like I was there with the boy and I could feel his pain.  Every  move he made, I made with him.  If he cried, I cried, if he laughed, I  laughed.  And though it was a sad book, I enjoy reading about people's  lives,  whether the book is fiction or non fiction.  Therefore, I recommend  this book to people who enjoy fiction or non ficton books about people's  lives.  I also recommend this book to people who like reading about black  people and white people who were prejudice.  And for me, a person who  doesn't like to read, a book has to be pretty good if I like it.  And this  book I like.	2000-05-11

Even though his parents had  a home he lived in a garebage can in the basement!Dave Pelzer is the author  of this outstanding phenomenon book! This book is the sequal to: A Child  Called It. The ages of this book should be 10 and over, because there is  some bad words like: hell but it just shows how he felt, so its necessary  for those kind of words. Also this book is very sad, because it has lots of  real life situations that people just can't bare to liten to. And little  kids wouldn't understand it to. This book is about Mr. Pelzer's horrible  childhood, and how he over came the horror of his ,childhood. And a hear  warming story of how many other parents or Foster Parents who helped him  along his teenage years and some of his younger years. In my opinion Dave  didn't have to write about his chilhood days. He could have kept it a  secret, but he didnt and from his actions he has probably saved few of kids  and parents lives. People should read this book, you will learn a lot from  it!	2000-05-11

It was based on the Holocaust, but it was not disturbing.  Some books on the Holocaust can be very disturbing because they are very real.  The Devil's Arithmetic is real but doesn't add in all the gruesome details.   It is an interesting book for kids because it gives elementary school kids  an idea of what people went through during the 1940's.  It also makes me  appreciate the freedom we have now.  I think Jane Yolen did an excellent  job of capturing the fear and suspense that the Jews went through, while  connecting the present and past whitout adding in the gruesome details.	2000-05-11

I recomend this book and  its sequels  for good  action  and thoughtful writing.	2000-05-11

It's easy to read and it makes you want to keep reading. Time flies while reading it, and it's easy to understand and picture what is going on. It's  basically about a wizard that grew up as a normal human or as they say in  the book a muggle. He eventually finds out he's a wizard and learns about  his past and it tells what happens throughout his life. He parents are dead  and he doesn't know exactly how they died and he is trying to figure it  out. He meets lots of new people and a lot of exciting things happen in his  life and it just a great book to read. I recommend this book to everyone  who likes to read and even people that find reading is boring cause after  you read this book you will love to read. So what I am saying is that this  is a great book.	2000-05-11

The idea of the story is you can bring back the dead by putting them in the  ancient indian burial ground behind the dead fall in the Pet Semetary. It  takes place in the everyday neighborhood in the suburbs. A family of four  have resently moved to town. There kids, unaware of death, and there  parents afraid to talk about it. Then their cat die and, it gets worse from  there. The suburbs are soon replaced by old, ancient woods and dreary  graveyards, and only adds to the creepyness. Although the characters are  pretty simple, they show true fear and emotion. All and all, it's a great  horror, and a classic Halloween story in my book.	2000-05-11

It teaches many lessons, and it goes inside Nancy's mind to show what she is really going  through.<br />One of the main lessons it teaches is that it can happen to you.   Nancy was just and average, happy 14-year-old who got involved with the  wrong guy.  Nancy, thought that was what she wanted, but she soon found out  it wasn't.  Her boyfriend ,Colin, raped her and gave her A.I.D's.  Nancy  thought she was being careful, choosing her boyfriends, but she wasn't  careful enough.  Which brings us to another lesson which was taught in the  book: you have to be careful and aware of who you are involved with, or  else there could be a harsh consequence.<br />This book is so effective in  showing its lesson because it is Nancy's actuall diary so it is all from  Nancy's point of view.  She writes about her fears, joys, frustrations,  ambitions, etc.  After hearing Nancy's point of view, it's really scary, so  you know you would never want to go through exactly what she went through.   It's the kind of book that makes you think and take action to protect  yourself.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone older than 12.  If you  are any younger and read this book, you wouldn't  understand it.  Also,  there are sex, and explicit language used in the book.  But anyone over 12  should read this book because it teches you so much and it is just as good  book!	2000-05-11

There are many things about this book that will make it stand out in your head  more than any other book. This is a very adventurous book that  will keep you reading. This book will amaze you in many ways.  This  book is wonderful, but hard to read. If you like books with easy words that  you can read quickly, then I do not recommend this for you. This book is  hard to read because of their southern dialect and bad grammar. This book  is very hard to read.  If you can get used to thye language, then  you will do fine with this book. It is a very adventurous book. There is  always something crazy going on, which makes it a lot more exiting and fun  to read.  Not only is the whole theme and plot and characters  wonderful, but there is also a great authors style. Mark Twain did an  excellent job of first of all capturing the setting of a hundred years ago  in the South, by making sure you got the feel and image in your mind of  where this takes place. He also writes from Huckleberry Finns prospective,  and does a wonderful job on trying to really become that character, and you  can tell in the things he writes. Mark Twain is an awesome writer and makes  it half the reason it is so good.  If you enjoy books with much  adventure then read &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Mark Twain is a wonderful  writer which makes the book much more worth reading. Mark Twain's classic  &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is defenintly a recommended book.	2000-05-11

Patricia D. Cornwell does an excellent job of  describing feelings, people, places, crime scenes, everything. Although the  plot is great, she does get a little bit graphic when she is explaining  what the killer does and what he has done.

Darcie had wanted had wanted to find his heart, to know who go  it and that David is still living, but only his heart. That is when her  journey to find Davids heart started. I recommend this book for almost  anybody.Searching for Davids heart is a realistic fiction book and it could  happen to almost anybody. It is based in how much one person can love  another, but when their gone, you can barely even live.	2000-05-11

He knows how to make a story have suspense and excitement.  He gives the reader something to keep reading on and on all night long just  to find out what happens in the end.

It talked about everything that a teen goes through in high school through a boy names  Charlie.  The story is a collection of letters he write to the person he  thinks can relate to him the most, but he never tells the person who he is.   When the book starts out he is a nervous boy starting high school.  He has  no friends because his best friend Mark has just died.  He does not have  anyone to talk to but his English teacher.  Throughout the book they form a  special bond together.  Along the way he meets great friends who teach him  many new thing.

If you like murder mysteries, full of suspense, then you'll definately love this book. This book involves car chases, threatening phone calls, and the fear of not knowing what or who is going  to strike in the next sentence. Alice Robie lives with her divorced father,  while her mother lives in another section of town. One day Alice receives a  strange phone call from a man, who claims to be her dad. It doesn't sound  much like him, but she believes him. He tells her to meet him at their  favorite ice cream shop along the Salmon River, in Connecticut. He also  gives her careful instructions to take the Corvette, her father's prized  possession. Alice is very suspicious, as her father would NEVER let her  drive the Corvette before this point in time, even if she had had her  driver's license, which she does not. Just as she is about to get into the  shiny red Corvette, she hears the condo's front door unlatch and open with  a shove. It sounds as if something heavy is being dragged across the floor,  and then there is a yell, and a THUMP!, and silence. She quickly crawls  underneath the Corvette as the sound of feet approach the one-car garage.  She waits and hears some noises, like the sound of keys on a keyboard being  pressed, some feet, and then the front door shuts, and she hears a car  pulling away. Alice quickly opens the garage door and pulls the red  Corvette out onto the street, knocking over a neighbor's clay planter. She  arrives at the ice cream shop, which is now closing up for the day, the  time being 5:00 PM. Alice, in a frenzy, turns on the radio and the music  calms her down. Suddenly, a news bulletin comes on. &quot;At approximately  4:30 PM, on Lake View Drive, Mr. Robie was murdered.&quot; Alice shrieks.  &quot;The murderer was seen to have driven away from the scene of the crime  in a....bright....red....Corvette.&quot; Frantically, she turns off the  radio, hops out of the car, rushes over to the pay phone, inserts  twenty-five cents, and dials her mother's number. &quot;Hello?&quot; Her  mother answers. &quot;Mom!&quot; Alice screams. &quot;Alice, dear! Alice,  we know. I got your e-mail with the confession in it....it's all right  dear, you must have been terribly mad....we know you killed your  father.&quot;	2000-05-11

The reason i feel it is well written is that when Cynthia Voigt describes something i feel like i am right there along side of the charecters.  In my English class we read Homecoming and that inspired me to read the next book in the Tillerman  Family Series.  The Tillermans have found a place they reallly enjoy with  their new found Grandmother.  In the end of homecoming Dicey asks Gram if  she can keep the sail boat that is in the shed.  If you have ever read the  book Homecoming, you will like the book Dicey's Song.  This book have very  funnie parts and some very sad ones.  So if you like realistic fiction this  is the book for you.	2000-05-11

I admit I did guess the ending, but it wasn't a guarantee and so it did not in any way harm the resolution for me. Such a unique setting and unusual  characters! Anita Shreve is a very talented writer. Having also read  &quot;Pilot's Wife,&quot; I will surely read more by this author.	2000-05-03
