There's an unsolved mystery deep in the ancestral past of Geneva Settle.  It has been 140 years since freed slave Charles Singleton was on the run from authorities, accused of murder and of dabbling in the dangerous social politics of the time.  Is it for this reason, forensic consultant Lincoln Rhymes asks his team, that sixteen year old Geneva was attacked as she researched this puzzle?  Or was it for inadvertently witnessing something that she shouldn't?  Someone out there is determined to get to Geneva, and fast.  Lincoln offers the protection of his home when it becomes apparent that Geneva cannot be left on the outside, even with police protection.    Whoever has put the orders out from above to take Geneva doesn't mind having a little police collateral damage along the way. <br />  <br />Working the scenes via his able bodied partner, policewoman Amelia Sachs, Rhyme is in two minds whether to expend manpower on solving a very old mystery or to concentrate on letting his brilliant mind work its magic on the actions of a killer in the present.  Charles Singleton gave tantalizing clues as to a the discovery of a great injustice to the American people in letters to his family, and it is from examining these that Rhyme is sure that the past is connected to these crimes of the present.  As the team of police and Rhyme sift through the mine of forensic evidence left at the crime scenes of the day they draw closer to finding out why someone would consider a Harlem schoolgirl such a threat that she warrants an immediate execution. <br />  <br />As with all the entries in this series, Rhyme's crew take a scientific approach on the environment and particulars of a crime scene in order to give the police a clearer path to a murderer.  The summary given at the end of each chapter helps the reader to assess and make their own conclusions in a sense of real-time along with the characters.  While the strength of these novels has always been in the details, there is not enough action and intrigue in \\"The Twelfth Card\\" to balance and back up the forensic detailing.  Another failing of this novel is the street language used by the various petty criminals and the school girls themselves.  At best it comes across as dated, at worst, laughable.  While still a tightly plotted crime novel, this read lacks any real pull or sense of suspense and isn't the best representation of an excellent series that has no apparent peer. <br />	2005-10-10

Dream job in a dream location, and the dream girl of all dream girls has walked into his somewhat directionless life.  There's the prospect of a little cash - in fact quite a lot of cash - to go with it.  His loyal pack of lifelong buddies from school have gotten together and plan on pulling off a sweet little deal from which they all will pocket a million each for their involvement.  Ned's input is minimal; he has to set off the alarms in a few of the houses in the rich oceanside suburb in order to have the local cops occupied while the real robbery, an art theft, is underway.  Most of the well-heeled of the town will be out, attending a ritzy charity function, so that should make the houses unoccupied.   As usual, things that sound too good to be true ARE too good to be true. <br />  <br />The robbery goes wrong and a panicked phone call from one of his buddies has Ned hightailing back to visit the scene of the crime.  His crew have all been killed, and his new lady love has also been brutally murdered in the hotel room that was the scene of afternoon delight for both of them earlier in the day.  Every cop available is after him and Ned has to go into hiding.  Someone set them all up, and Ned wouldn't put it past dear old Dad, a lifelong criminal, to have had a hand in it somewhere.  His father is dying but that doesn't put him out of the running.  With the bodies piling up around him Ned has to act fast to clear his name and seek revenge for his loved ones. <br />  <br />\\"Lifeguard\\" is exactly as you would presume; great beach or holiday fare that will fly past in an enjoyable afternoon's reading.  The trademark Patterson short and sharp chapters feature and do the job of which they surely must have been designed for - to suck the reader into going that one chapter further more each time.  There's nothing like a racey little chase novel for you when you've got some time for yourself and \\"Lifeguard\\" won't be leaving you with anything more lastingthan memories of a pleasant, lightweight read. <br />  <br />Author Andrew Gross also co-authored with Patterson on \\"The Jester\\" and books two and three of the Women's Murder Club series, \\"Second Chance\\" and \\"Third Degree\\". <br />  <br />	2005-09-21

Through with working for her oily cousin Vinnie, Stephanie Plum is doing her best to please her mother and take a job that doesn't involve fires, shootouts, or her car being blown up.  The world of bounty hunting can't leave her alone though and she suspects that Spiro, son of Stiva the undertaker, might not actually be dead.  Dead people can't write threatening notes and freak her out with creepy little gifts. <br />  <br />It would probably also make the rest of the world happy if she shacked up in the marital way with long time on again/off again boyfriend Joe Morelli.  At least it might stop his evil eyed grandmother from coming out with the dire predictions every time that they meet.  When her latest employer, also an evil eyed old lady, is blown up attempting to get into Stephanie's car Ms Plum is sure that Spiro means to do real harm.  When Morelli is cleaned up, man versus vehicle, outside the funeral, Steph has to take serious action before someone she actually loves is killed.  What other strong man in her life can she turn to for help? <br />  <br />\\"Eleven on Top\\" features more of the same of what we've come to expect from this series; lots of laughs and gross out moments.  Stephanie Plum seems to be hardening up to the world a little which is probably not a bad thing with the passage of time and all that's she's experienced in the world of bounty hunting during the ten novels of this best-selling series.  The love triangle, such as it is, is getting more than a little tired but it would probably kill the series, as far as the die-hard fans go, should that particular situation be resolved.  Evanovich does her usual excellent job of throwing Stephanie in situations that mostly blind luck or a strong man will rescue her from, showcasing the comedic talents of friends and family of the 'Burg along the way.  Another fun read in a great series that inevitably, with this many books down, is starting to lose some of its shine.  Having said that, the Stephanie Plum books are still the best comedic crime novels out there at present and are must-have reads to brighten your day. <br />	2005-09-12

When two top names in the world of reconstructive surgery are murdered, Eve doesn't need to go too far to look for suspects.  Someone who wasn't happy with their last body make over, their last new face?  Not understanding what drives people to change themselves either minimally or dramatically Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the NYPSD immediately feels that the beautiful suspect caught on tape leaving the office from the scene of the first murder must be one unhappy client.  Where did she come from?  The family of Dr Icove, Jnr, are a picture perfect little unit backed by the beautiful face and maternal resolve of the too perfect Mrs Icove.   Who stands to gain the most from the murder of two such influential, universally adored doctors? <br /> <br />As always suspecting that there's dirt behind a spotless facade, Even uses all her resources, including her billionaire husband, to look deeper in what appears on the surface to be a very successful company both morally and financially.  Much good has been done by the two doctors, particularly Dr Icove Snr who was a Nobel Prize winner for his good works with victims of war.  A long history makes a very long time-line to delve into and Eve doesn't care a whit that her investigation of the victims upsets the family and respectful public.  With little to go on other than a short video of an unidentified woman, Eve has to work back from the finished product, the victim, in order to figure what brought about his death. <br /> <br />All the usual gang appears here, which is quite an array to keep up on if you haven't been following this irresistible series.  Author Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb has excelled all the way through in creating memorable, quirky characters that you either learn to love or accept anyway for their more detestable attributes.   If you've kept up the reads until this latest novel the world of New York, 2059, is as familiar to you in visage or ideal as the modern day city is.  The workings of life in thefuture (which is a doing a 2001 in this series - as in we are getting so close to the date in which the series is set, and yet it's difficult to believe that technology will keep up with futuristic imagination) is seamlessly described using now familiar terms for every day technology in the house and office.  <br /> <br />Roberts has tackled an issue that is very topical today and given it a possible future day spin in what scientific invention may lead to in the micro world of gene selection and experimentation.  More tightly plotted than its series predecessors of late it has been good to largely leave behind the personal angst of the prickly Eve and her gorgeous Roarke in order to take in some well written suspense. <br /> <br />\\"Origin in Death\\" is the 24th novel (including short story inclusions) in the Eve Dallas series. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-12

Marseilles kindly remembers the rugby player Daniel Jacquot, though they now know him as Chief Inspector Jacquot, homicide.  It does come in handy to have the people of his home town feel that they own him and his sporting achievements of more than twenty years before.   He must deliver into the hands of the public the killer that the press have dubbed \\"The Waterman\\".  It is not that clever a moniker - the Waterman, after having his way with the victims, leaves the bodies in water.  Forensically, a nightmare, but a challenge for the French homicide team to face. <br />  <br />Paired off with a transfer in from the vice department, Jacquot is keen as always to follow his own instincts and investigate alone.   His very young girlfriend has left him and his apartment, complete with nosey land lady, holds no appeal for him.  Marseilles has its own court of the rich and successful who manipulate the authorities to further their own ventures and it is into this world that Jacquot strays in order to find a connection for his clients, the victims.  A local gym was used by two of the girls and it may be more than just lucky co-incidence that the name of one elite company and its untouchable owners keeps surfacing wherever he looks.  Is it sport, or are these young girls murdered to protect someone or something? <br />  <br />This is a sophisticated read set in a city well known to the author Martin O'Brien, a former travel writer.  Sub plots and individual agendas abound in \\"Jacquot and the Waterman\\" which will take an organized mind to keep nailed down, as they read this fast moving thriller.  The conclusion could feel like a major let down after this investment, forgiven perhaps for the fascinating characters with their glittery city that you have been fondly introduced to along the way.  O'Brien has created in Jacquot a memorable hero in the form of a clever, moody loner, though the fawning descriptions from Jacquot's adoring French public are slapped on a little thick over the course of the book.  This series shows huge promise with it's curiously well rounded homicide detective who doesn't seem to fit any accepted police procedural mould out on the market at present.  A showy and well presented novel that would fall more into the category of thriller than crime novel with its cosmopolitan backdrop and flashy, well-heeled cast. <br />	2005-08-31

Her daily hallucinations and memory lapses are at the point where both her husband, a senior government official and her physician wish to perform invasive surgery on her brain in an effort to discover what has gone wrong.  This terrifies her so much that she seeks another opinion, and begins to doubt that all the problems she's currently experiencing are solely to do with her own illness.  The discovery that even the face she sees looking back at her in the mirror is not her own sends a terrified Anna on the run, trusting no one but her new doctor to speak the truth to her. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In the Turkish quarter of Paris a series of grisly murders baffle the investigating officer.  Paul Nerteaux has a burning urge to prove himself and in the effort of doing so, takes an enormous risk.  He enlists the help of a retired French police officer, Jean-Louis Schiffer who once was the scourge of both the police and criminals alike.  What all will acknowledge is that Schiffer's knowledge of the murder patch is unparalled, and his contacts remain strong still.  It is the belief of Schiffer that the attacks upon the working Turkish girls of the illegal sweatshops could be the work of an extremist group called the Grey Wolves.  The Wolves are searching for someone, and they will kill all in their path to recover the renegade member of their own. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />\\"Empire of the Wolves\\" has a brilliant start that sucks you straight in hard with the pages turning in a blur.  Eventually though, this slows down.  The two sub plots can't compete for interest; it is the tale of Anna that fascinates and the political and procedural maneuvers of the French police will most likely fail to have the same attraction to the reader.  The metamorphosis of Anna Heymes should hold your attention throughout the read but the unsuccessful merging of the two sub-plots becomes quite ridiculous as the novelist attempts to tie them both together. In the fashion of the thriller last-man-standing read \\"The Empire of the Wolves\\" has a cold and melodramatic conclusion. It would depend on what reading camp you fall into; there is no moral satisfaction in the outcome of this read which shouldn't scare off the readers of noir thrillers, but if you're anticipating a twist-upon-twist suspense thriller and looking forward to seeing your heroine her fight to regain her life and revenge herself upon the evil-doers, then perhaps this one isn't for you. <br />	2005-07-27

Tess Monaghan doesn't like to take on the missing wife/missing husband cases.  If they've left, apparently under their own steam, there must be a good reason, right?  And why would you hand them over to the client, the person they were probably running away from?  It doesn't occur to Mark Rubin that there was something wrong in his relationship with his young wife Natalie.   He's a charming man, rich and successful to boot, but it doesn't sit easy with Tess when she takes on the case.  Mark is not being entirely honest about what he knows about his wife's history.  But is this out of shame, sheer ignorance, or for some more practical and sinister reason? <br />  <br />Young Isaac Rubin isn't sold on why he has to go on the run with his mother and the twins, his younger brother and sister.  There must be a way of getting back to his father without his mother or her creepy new friend knowing.  Not knowing that his father has hired a private investigator to find him, Isaac hatches his own plans about how to make contact with the parent who has always understood him most.  Tess has to deal with the both the rigid faith of Mark Rubin and his blind stubbornness.  For a young Russian girl to give up all of her freedom to become a Jewish wife there had to be a lot of love or a lot of hopeless submission involved.  As she digs into the past of the mysterious Natalie Tess is sure her disappearance was so much more than the impulsive flight of a repressed housewife.  <br />  <br />\\"By A Spider's Thread\\" is the eighth novel in the Tess Monaghan series.  Lippman's heroine has a pragmatic and single minded approach to her work; classically gumshoe in approach as she doggedly pursues each and every lead in finding the four missing members of the Rubin family.  The multi perspective is a boon to the narrative, as Lippman does a good job with the differences in adult and child viewpoints.  The major plot twist is difficult to accept, but once past the revelation of this point it becomes more evident that a very human tragedy will have to occur.  It lends somewhat of a dismal air to the second half of the novel even though the reader is increasingly caught up with concern in the outcome.  The working relationship between Tess and her client becomes more intricate and real as time passes, and bless Monaghan for not taking that down the obvious road. <br />  <br />A solid crime read in a very successful series, easy to read and methodical in its approach though lacking in any real cliffhangers or breath taking suspense. <br />	2005-07-24

Cat Ferris was brought up a princess in a troubled household, one of those last great bastions of rich white gentility in the town of Natchez.  She escaped it all as soon as she could to become a forensic odontologist and loses herself in the arms of many men.  Her latest has had some impact as she is pregnant to him, but he's no different than all the others.  Sean Regan is married and unlikely ever to leave his wife but he has a vested interest in Cat other than the illicit personal pleasure she gives him.  The two of them are dynamite in solving cases with their relationship remaining firmly in the closet for reasons other than the need to protect their moral reputations.  Sean is with the New Orleans police department and has Cat assist when a serial killer leaves a vicious calling card in the form of bite marks left on his hapless victims.  What is the connection between all these men from different walks of life? <br />  <br />Cat is losing the fight with depression, alcohol abuse, suicidal thoughts and the many other demons in her life.  She returns to the family home and unexpectedly some new information comes forward about her father's death.  Cat's father, a war veteran, was murdered on the family estate when she was just a little girl.  Cat's autocratic grandfather always ruled that part of the world with an iron fist so it's to this day that she has never learnt the truth of what happened that night.  When the prime suspect of the serial killings claims to know what it really is that haunts Cat, all roads to catch a killer lead back deep to the closed community in which she was unhappily raised. <br />  <br />Greg Iles has written some great books, all of them written prior to 2003 which is when he wrote \\"Footprints of God\\".  Unfortunately that novel and his latest may be the ones that jumped the shark as \\"Blood Memory\\" is another long winded novel with unlikable characters that labors onerously towards conclusion.  This novel isn't incredibly long at around 500 pages but at least a hundred pages of that is unnecessary padding.  We have featured here another flawed hero - which is fine, but they do have to have some redeeming features so that we have a measure of concern about their fate. \\"Blood Memory\\" would seem to have all the right stuff with deep dark family secrets, a serial killer and a young medical protagonist.  Unfortunately the effort to merge the two storylines is clumsy and contrived with too much of the personal angst getting in the way of making a suspenseful plot work.  Read Iles earlier novels first and get yourself hooked before attempting this one. <br />	2005-06-17

Deputy District Attorney Sam Kincaid is thrilled with her promotion.  Now working with Major Crimes she is under no illusion that she will be tried before being tested with the major responsibilities of the busy unit.  Assigned her first case for what she considers to be a hand-hold, Sam is given some fast lessons in political protocol.  One of the legal system's own has disappeared and the whole situation must be delicately handled. Sadly it is not long before there is a body found that matches the description of Clarissa Easterbrook. <br /> <br />Working closely with the homicide cops and so awkwardly also with her new boyfriend, Sam isn't keen to accept a slam dunk on her first case so quickly when it all falls together just that little bit too neatly.  It's where the body has been dumped that interests her, more than a peeved former offender who became mildly threatening when a decision did not go his way.  Clarissa wasn't the saint some thought her to be and had her own secrets that she kept from her husband, sister and best friend.  Sam's protective father, once a cop himself, isn't keen for Sam to go up against the big guns on this one so soon in her new position.  There's more to his reluctance to see his daughter shine than just fatherly concern, and the reasons behind this lies in his own unhappy past with the police force. <br /> <br />\\"Missing Justice\\" is novel number two in the Sam Kincaid series by author Alafair Burke.  No doubt drawing on her own legal career Burke has written a more polished novel second time around with a more complicated plot that unfortunately comes together a little too late and too conveniently to be remotely credible.  It turns out that a lot of her details are unnecessary but as this also created a trail of effective red herrings perhaps that was deliberate.  Too much of the \\"gush\\" factor detracts from this read and stylizing the character of Sam Kincaid into junior legal hero doesn't quite work with the ditziness of some ofthe character's actions.  Burke's secondary characters are really only wall paper to the main action but could perhaps be explored in greater depth with some closer attention in later novels.  Light legal fiction with a girl hero lead: \\"Missing Justice\\" doesn't have the weight of a suspenseful legal thriller but then again, perhaps this less taxing sub category is nurturing a new queen. <br />	2005-06-10

It's not good enough for Sunny Randall that her ex-husband has moved on and married someone else.  He's still giving out the signals, and while Sunny doesn't actually want him for herself anymore she's not sure she wants anyone else to have him either.  It is at this point of her life that in walks Sarah Markham.  Sarah is a college student, suspiciously not on good terms with her folks who has finally decided to solve the niggling life question that she has always had.  Is she really the child of her parents?  It sounds like a lot of arrested development whining to Sunny but she takes the case to heart particularly after some initial peering into the Markham family facade. <br />  <br />Nothing works in this family, and there is a definite lack of substance.  The parents are refusing to assist and are also refusing to end the matter for all by having a DNA comparison test.   Sarah is under threat and it seems someone wants her to stop asking questions about her past.  Sunny of course suspects the threat as coming from the parents until Mr. Markham himself is murdered.  With her client on her couch, and she on her psychiatrist's, Sunny's life is crowded enough without additional help from wannabe thugs and threatening lawyers into the bargain.  With a helpful cop and some helpful friends backing her up, Sunny charges down the investigative path to truth. <br />  <br />If you could come up with some kind of winning text book formula for a light crime \\"chick\\" read (dare I say it), you need look no further than \\"Melancholy Baby\\".  There's just enough of all the right ingredients in this one; some angst, some humour, some mystery and some great characters.  This is a dialogue driven novel of the witty and entertaining kind that breezes by at the speed of light.  No prizes will be given for solving the parental mystery as that is obvious from a mile off, but its good fun to watch Sunny take the steps to resolution for her client while trying to get herself through the hazards of her own emotional life one day at a time.  Terrific not to see a plastic heroine with ditzy little traits; Sunny Randall comes across as very real and believable.  Great fun and definitely geared more towards the female half of the mystery readers species. <br />  <br />	2005-06-01

Also, this time, he telegraphs his intents to Detective Carella via notes delivered to the station containing Shakespearean quotes.  The various winos, druggies and hookers about town are scoring a hundred a pop to deliver the messages so there are no clues there, despite the fact they all claim to have been paid by the same woman who keeps changing her disguises.  The first of the notes refer to the death of the woman who injured the Deaf Man eons ago and left him for dead.  With that little piece of revenge carried out the Deaf Man rides again with new evil intentions. <br />  <br />There's a lot going on in this book with the soap operaish continuations of various sub plots of previous 87th Precinct novels appearing here.  Considering that \\"Hark!\\" is the 54th novel of the series, McBain's skill at carrying it all forward to the new century is admirable.  While he appears to \\"dumb down\\" his heroes and sometimes presents them as little more than Keystone cops, McBain's obvious love for his creations still shows and he never attempts to make them politically correct or racially sensitive.   <br />  <br />If you ride with the a plot that swings this way and that you'll enjoy this read of \\"Hark!\\" as it speeds by with pages filled with rapid fast dialogue and tangents you could hang a whole new plot on just about every time.  The conclusion is a bit of a fizzer but it still winds up as a decent read, regardless of your history with this legendary series. <br />	2005-05-23

Sarah Pribeck and her new husband Michael Shiloh make an odd pair, but a suited pair.  Both cops and married to their jobs, the two are loners with few friends and lots of personal baggage.  Michael is soon to join the F.B.I., and Sarah knows that he would not miss the introduction to his training at Quantico for anything.  It is frightening enough that he hasn't reported in to his new bosses.  What clinches it as a missing person's case for Sarah is when she finds his luggage, still packed, under their bed. <br />  <br />Sarah previously worked missing persons with her partner Genevieve until the older woman's world fell apart with the death of her daughter.  Sarah sorely misses her expertise as she tries to make sense of Michael's disappearance, knowing and understanding so little of what made her husband the introvert loner he is today.  She cannot go forward, as she knows all there was to know of their life and planned future together.  So she must go back. <br />  <br />This was one of those novels that really showed its best moments in the trailers, i.e. the descriptive summaries of this debut mystery thriller sounded great but the read itself was only mediocre.  Our heroine behaves quite bizarrely for woman trying to find her supposedly loved husband and you quite often have to scratch your head as to why she acts as she does.  There wasn't enough in the plot to stretch this one out to a full length novel so there is a lot of \\"filler\\" and backtracking to bring it to a novel length conclusion.  There isn't a single appealing character in this read so it's a hope that author Jodi Compton has done a lot of makeover work on them for the second novel (now published).  \\"The 37th Hour\\" can sometimes annoy but fortunately holds enough of a strong teaser on the outcome to get you through what is mostly a bland and unexciting read. <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-05-21

Matt Hunter never expected to be able to return to the life that he once had.  A college fight which resulted in the accidental death of the other party takes four years of his life and changes him forever.  His goal of becoming a lawyer is off the cards so he works as a paralegal in his deceased brother's firm and leaves in a cheap house in a cheap suburb.  The great American dream of owing your own home with accompanying wife and two kids has had something of a setback, but he has the wife part already, a child on the way and the dream home is under construction.  He has not been forgiven for ending a young man's life, but Matt has hope for his future.  It takes a cell phone picture of his wife with another man to end all that.<br /><br />Loren Muse has to hide a smile when she is called in by her old school mistress to investigate the death of a nun.  The autopsy picks up that the deceased has breast implants - not shocking in itself, but it seems to indicate the nun may have smudged the details of her past life before becoming a servant to God.  As an investigator for the county Loren has her antenna well and truly put up when the F.B.I. seem to be all over the case too.  A phone call from the deceased was to the home of a family member of one Matt Hunter, old school friend of Loren and ex-con.  She isn't as convinced that all fault lies at Matt's door as the F.B.I. seems to be, but when two more bodies are found and more trails lead to Matt, a reluctant doubt begins to set in.<br /><br />\\"The Innocent\\" is the latest in a chain of thriller stand-alone best sellers from author Harlan Coben.  They all have a similar plot line in that your average professional has something awful happen to him in which sets the cops on his tail, and while on the run he must discover the truth to save himself and his loved ones.  This latest effort is not as good as the others and while not being a bad read, it merely rates as an okay rather than outstanding effort.<br /><br />\\"The Innocent\\" does a nice side line with the investigator Loren Muse, a semi police procedural viewpoint that Coben hasn't really experimented with prior to this novel.

Called out of a girl's night out to assist with the capture of two on the run murder suspects, Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is drawn into a high speed pursuit that only ends when the other vehicle crashes.  As Boxer and her sometimes partner Jacobi try to free the two young and hyped up suspects from their wrecked car they are set upon and shot.  The return fire kills the young girl and wounds her brother, earning Boxer a nice fat civil law suit from the grieving parents.  It makes sense for Boxer to disappear for awhile and recover from her wounds somewhere quiet.  Spending some time house-sitting for her sister in a nearby town doesn't however end up being the restful time out of the media's eye that she hoped for. <br />  <br />Half Moon Bay residents are living in fear.  There's a group of killers out there brutally attacking families in their own homes for no discernable reason.  The flaying the victims receive tie in each kill to the next, but not much else is revealing itself to help the baffled local police.  Keen to assist Boxer steps immediately on the toes of the local authorities when she tries to put her own years of experience to use.  Awaiting trial is torturing her, and so are the similarities these new kills have to that one case all detectives always remember, her first unsolved.   <br />  <br />This is the fourth book in James Patterson's women's murder club series.  They are, if you like, soft crime novels despite the fact that yes, they're all about people who murder people (it's low on the scare factor and easy on the gorey descriptions here).  \\"4th of July\\" has in common with it's predecessors in that it's a one sitting read of the sharp short chapters Patterson seems so fond of, easy to zip through and an all over enjoyable read while not remotely taxing your whodunit brain cells.   <br />  <br />These novels are extremely popular and rightfully so, though perhaps a bit of a shock to the crime reader who was bedazzled by the brilliance of the earlier Alex Cross novels that Patterson made his fame and fortune on.  This series is nothing like the Cross series and has more in common with the sickly sweet books featuring the bird-children that Patterson also writes.  Lots of the golly gosh gush, and not too much of the edge and suspense.  The main character Lindsay Boxer is likeable enough and it's good to catch up on what she's doing as always with this read.  Forgettable fun fiction when you want a break from the hard stuff, or perhaps right up your alley if you prefer to be able to sleep after a spot of late night crime reading. <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-05-17

Still grieving for her deceased husband, Anna lives on an ailing farm with her step-father and young son.  The community accepts her for doing the right thing by her family, but aren't entirely comfortable with her deafness or her living arrangements.  Her family is a living reminder of old crimes and of evil that was born and raised in the town.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Delray Corbett always knew that his two stepsons, Cecil and Carl, would look him up one day. It has been enough for this stern man that he can provide for his grandson and the woman he has grown to love despite himself.  Delray always thought the two men had managed to get away with a more serious crime than the one that they were put inside for, armed robbery.  The unsolved murder of a local girl stirred up talk at the time, and it still does.  Retiring police chief Ezzy Hardge is still unable to let it go.  It was the one case that stayed with him, and it has finally caused the end of his marriage too.  He suspects immediately the new hired hand that Delray has taken on, the mysterious Jack Sawyer.  Maybe old Delray is just a cautious man.  Carl and Cecil are now both on the loose, and it's a pretty sure thing that they are headed right home to exact a little familial revenge. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />\\"Unspeakable\\" is a book at odds.  The odd, startling snippets of graphic violence and sex don't seem to fit in with the rest of the novel.  There's a whole host of characters, all of which are sadly stereotypical, with their own little agendas but none of them are explored in sufficient depth for the curious reader.  The heroine is plucked straight out of a women's romantic drama along with her man and the tragic plight she finds herself in.  There's little mystery and the action only hots up in the very last pages of this reasonably hefty novel.  Sandra Brown is a best selling author of suspense thrillers but from this read, her market aim would seem to be way off.  No one objects to a plot worthy romance, but the saccharine sweet offerings in \\"Unspeakable\\" are pretty well summed up in the title.  Amiable reading but nothing to get excited about. <br /> <br />	2005-05-04

Called to assist on scene in a possible hostage situation, Dodge takes position with his rifle to observe to what  appears to be a domestic about to explode.  Through his scope he sees the terrified wife and child, cowering in the corner of the bedroom as the husband rants and raves threateningly above them.  At the crucial moment Dodge shoots, and kills.  As if the first kill on the job wasn't enough to send the ice water through his veins, what the wife does next does the job.  She mouths him a thank you, through the window to the apartment in which he has taken his stance. <br />  <br />Catherine Rose Gagnon lost her innocence over the course of a month, spent underground and at the complete mercy of her deviate captor.  Kept in a cage as a sexual pet after her abduction, it was only luck that freed her one day from a possible life of torment.  Changed forever, Catherine's problems abound in her personal life and relations with her family.  With the death of her husband courtesy of  the police sniper's rifle, her problems however aren't over.  Her young son has a history of poor health and her husband's parents are experts too at manipulation.  They want full custody of Nathan, and are prepared to throw anyone to the wolves in order to get him.  Bobby Dodge has suit filed against him for the killing of the Gagnon's spoilt son, and has to enter into a partnership with the dark Catherine in order to save himself. <br />  <br />Lisa Gardner hasn't written a bad novel yet, and this racey little ride into the dark side of man (and woman) is her best one so far.  Despite the fact that there is no one character here you could really find yourself liking you are drawn along for the ride with twist upon twist thrown at you in the final chapters.  None of that slushy romance stuff here (well, apart from sex), just lots of interesting mess created by a nasty little pile of people with equally nasty secrets to hide.  Fascinating stuff to the end. <br />	2005-04-05

But, like all things, it had to change and some parts of it would have to die.  Nick, the second eldest, has become a cop to his home town.  The first homicide he must deal with cannot help but feel too close, knowing the town as he does.  Janelle Vonn had a terrible upbringing and an even more terrible end.  She was decapitated; left for discovery in an unused packing house that every kid who grew up in the area was more than familiar with.  Nick and his three brothers certainly had experienced legendary clashes with the Vonn family, and those old feuds still have not been let go.  It was the girls that suffered most in that family of domineering men, and it is exceptionally sad that one girl who tried to lift herself up and away from her roots ended up being dragged down and destroyed by them. <br />  <br />The Becker family have known their own losses.  The fabric that knit them all together was loosened by the death of Clay in the Vietnam War.  Smart talking Clay was the bright spark of the Becker family; Nick was the golden boy, David was the religious one and Andy, the baby, was to make use of his gift of the gab.  Andy has resisted so far the siren song of larger newspapers to report for his home town that was once full of orange groves.  He feels backed into a corner when asked to report on the murder of Jonelle Vonn, the ex beauty queen who emerged herself fatally in the sex and drugs culture of the new age 60's.  Andy walks a tightrope around what he knows is true about the Vonn family and the need to protect his own. <br />  <br />The scope of this novel could not be fully explored within the constraints of less than 300 pages.  There is so much going on, all at the same time and all over the place that to do it all justice a larger, more measured effort was required.  The attempt to mesh it all together here in \\"California Girl\\" has resulted in a very busy novel that frustrates more than it entertains.  It does, of course, span a number of decades in which the political climate is influential on the decisions made by the characters in the novel.  Important characters or instances are clumsily introduced to the reader who up to that point was getting pleasantly lulled into the nostalgia of once of those coming-of-age reads. <br />  <br />Forget the whodunit factor as that is made patently obvious to you at an early age and unless there is to be a sequel, there is not a satisfying enough resolution to the Becker brothers story.  Not the best effort from this legend of an American novelist but still, in parts, a very classy read. <br />	2005-04-05

Who would have thought a day in the life of an inner city bike courier could end so badly?  Jace Damon knows his routes and knows his customers, considering himself privately to be a bit of mean messenger on wheels as many of his compadres on bike seats do as well.  His company sends him out to do a late day pickup from Leonard Lowell, oily attorney-at-law, to go to a delivery address that turns out to be a dud.  While wondering why he has to deliver to an empty parking lot Jace is set upon.  The local knowledge every good bike courier has in spades helps Jace to escape, sadly dragging his mangled bike with him.  It would make a guy want to know what's going on.  It's a pity Lowell can't tell him, as the guy is now dead. <br /> <br />There's not much inside the package but it must be worth killing for.  Jace has much he needs to protect, being the sole guardian of his little brother.  The two of them have long evaded the clutches of the welfare authorities and are masters at living under the radar.  Being a suspect in a murder is the last thing Jace needs right now.  How does he run and hide when the person he loves the most is left behind, defenseless? <br /> <br />Not that this was a surprise, but this novel wasn't half bad.  Tami Hoag has in her previous novels veered back into romantic melodrama, and in others strictly walked the line with poor characterization.  Happily this novel does neither and has a heck of a lot going on - no such thing as a stereotype raising its ugly head in this read.  Allowing for the shades of a TV movie kind of ending, it's easy to see how this tightly plotted novel would translate well to the movie medium.  \\"Kill the Messenger\\" is good stuff and well worth investing your time in; also it would be a very good introductory stand alone if you are new to this author. <br />	2005-03-24

They need that in order to take in their male prey and make off with the spoils after his usefulness has been served.  FBI Agent John O'Hara is certain that the death of another successful and vibrant man is murder disguised as an unexpected tragedy.  There are the usual elements - the \\"widow\\" being in this case the beautiful and talented Nora Sinclair. What is missing is the motive - Sinclair doesn't seem to benefit in any real monetary sense from the death of Connor Brown.  O'Hara needs to play a role for this case just as he is sure that Nora Sinclair is playing out a part all of her own creation.  Enter Craig Reynolds, insurance investigator.  Perhaps the possibility of a bogus life insurance payout might bring out the claws in this fascinating, dangerous woman.   <br />  <br />Author James Patterson, with his co-writer Howard Roughan, has churned out another fast and very marketable thriller.  Those short chapters fly by and make \\"Honeymoon\\" a single morning or afternoon's reading only.  There are a few unfinished threads that might annoy at the ending (predictable), but it's an easy read that will interest anyone in taking in a standalone by one of the world's most popular authors. <br />  <br />There is little here to amaze and \\"Honeymoon\\" doesn't attempt to drag in any serious character issues or complications that may have slowed up its driving pace.  Fans of Patterson might lament that \\"Honeymoon\\" is one of his newer, disposable thrillers, following a winning formula with few variations.  Others may not care; \\"Honeymoon\\" is fun airport, beach towel, or bedside table fodder that admirably does the job of taking you away for an enjoyable, short reading escape. <br />	2005-03-23
US	34774939	R2OLYXXWNW7XYE	0805073868	152732243	Judgment Calls: A Mystery	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Bland debut.	The career spotlight is not focused on Deputy District Attorney Samantha Kincaid with her current job.  The vice cases she prosecutes aren't the big time career winners, so when local police come cap in hand for assistance with a sexual assault and attempted murder, she's interested.  The usual hand passes have been given to this one as while the victim has got her details straight, she is not the ideal person to appeal to a jury.    Thirteen year old Kendra Martin admitted belatedly that she's lately taken to prostitution to pay for her new habit, and was high on the night of her brutal attack.  With a solid identification, Kincaid and the cops are ready to move on this one, dragging their reluctant victim along with them. <br />  <br />The defense attorney seems to want to make a big statement on this one, and Kincaid is sucker punched at the trial with a hit on the integrity of the investigating officers.  Former flame Chuck Forbes had his rising career almost snuffed out before it began when he was accused of leading a witness in a high profile serial killer case.  This new case is likened to the same, and it is not long before the media take flight.  Someone is staking claim to the attack of Kendra Martin and others, throwing Kincaid's case wide open to be linked with the older crimes.  If there's a serial killer at hand, he'd like to eliminate the threat of his only surviving witness.  Kincaid must not only protect her client, her friend Chuck but also herself from the threat of a maniac who has now decided he wants his own turn at being the media's darling. <br />  <br />\\"Judgment Calls\\"  was a debut novel for author Alafair Burke, who has written two further novels since featuring district attorney Samantha Kincaid.  This isn't a stellar first novel, but it should introduce enough new faces for the reader to take the interest forward to the next book.  There is little suspense as the whodunit factor is revealed along the way, and the rest of the journey is in the process - the detailing of which gets a little tedious.  It gets to be sickly as Burke talks up her protagonist, via the secondary characters, to be some kind of avenging saint.  Also, for a supposedly smart woman, Kincaid gets to do some rather dumb things.  This is a light thriller read, possibly appealing to the reader who prefers the gorey details to be tucked away behind a teaching view into the courtroom, with some harmless romantic scenes included. <br /> <br />	2005-03-23

The bogs of the Irish midlands reveal their secrets in all due time, more often now that the landscape is being increasingly carved up by the local farmers.  As the turf is cut and dried to be burnt as a fuel, there is occasionally a find that excites archaeologists and the scandal lovers alike.  When two bodies turn up in the peat bogs in as many days, both showing signs that they were victims of ritualized killings, the community is given something delicious to talk about. <br /> <br />Visiting American pathologist Nora Gavin is called in because of her past experience.  The opportunity to examine hands on another peat bog body is an opportunity not to be missed in the name of research.  The second recent find is not however that ancient and is quickly identified as belonging to a family that still live and work in the area.  In this myth soaked area of Ireland the paganistic rite of a \\"triple\\" death is not unusual, but to find a body slain in such a manner with an estimated date of death to be only twenty or so years ago, it takes the find from being considered historically curious, to threatening. <br /> <br />\\"Lake of Sorrows\\" is full of characters that really need their own novels to fully explore their murky pasts and how they got to be all together in one secluded little Irish town.  Hart needs to either write longer saga length novels or tone down some of the melodrama to keep the focus on her two protagonists and the crime at hand.  In providing a lead for the third novel in the series Hart has her character in Dr Gavin behaving like a teenager in her rejection of her Irish lover Cormac Macguire who we expected to become the love of her life at the end of \\"Haunted Ground.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Hart excels at keeping up the dark and sombre mood; everyone has their secrets, and everyone has their burdens of sadness to carry.   \\"Lake of Sorrows\\" treads in the shadows.  It is a mystery novel that is light on plot, though soaked with rich and memorable characterization in its secondary and introductory characters.  The third novel promises to take the action out of the bogs and into the U.S. so it will be interesting to see if this will lighten up the tone of this grim though beautifully evocative series. <br />	2005-02-08

The Hypnerotomachia Poliphili was the obsession of Tom Sullivan's <br />father, to the detriment of both his own family and to his professional <br />reputation. Tom Sullivan knows what it is to live with frustration and parental <br />neglect but cannot escape the pull of this puzzling book as he nears the end of <br />his days at Princeton University. He has not based his thesis on this maddening <br />book but for his college room mate Paul, there is no other puzzle worth solving. <br /> <br />Paul Harris's involvement brings him under the tutelage of Richard Curry, a man <br />whose whole career may hinge on whatever discoveries his bright pupil can <br />deliver. With the murder of the project's scribe there is more reason still to <br />decipher and solve the puzzles that have bested so many for so long. There is a <br />secret text within the Hypnerotomachia that the anonymous author has trusted <br />only to those with the dedication and the knowledge to find it. Long ago <br />secrets that once needed to be hidden must now come to the light. <br /> <br />Debut authors and best friends Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason worked on <br />writing \\"The Rule of Four\\" for more than six years. It shows. Don't take <br />comparisons with you to this read, as while more popular authors may provide the <br />thrills they wouldn't necessarily provide the achingly beautiful prose and the <br />near perfect air of regret and melancholia that shrouds this interesting and <br />curious novel. The whole tone of the book is sepia stained with nostalgia and <br />such is the elegance of composition that it elevates the read to the much over <br />used tag of a \\"literary\\" novel. <br /> <br />\\"The Rule of Four\\" is not a great treasure hunt of exciting facts and is more <br />about the journey. We follow the four Princeton college friends who are all <br />caught up in the riddles of an ancient book, and of what becomes of them when <br />they become caught up between two very competitive and obsessed professors. A <br />solid read that does however get caught up in its own pomposity, \\"The Rule of <br />Four\\" perhaps tries too hard to showcase the research and cleverness of its <br />characters (and of course, its authors) at the expense of providing the <br />page-turning pull to its readers. Caldwell and Thomason are definitely authors <br />to watch. <br />	2005-02-06

In the final dying days of his term, the President of the United States isn't averse to accepting a little bribe or a little persuasion to pardon hot ticket criminals from serving out the remainder of their terms.  Especially when it comes with the endorsement of the C.I.A.  Once a force to be reckoned with, ex Washington powerbroker Joel Backman no longer has any clout to bargain for his own release, so it's more than just a pleasant surprise when he is bundled up and transported hush hush to Italy, with the demand that he learn to be a native, and fast. <br />  <br />What brought down the fall of a great man was greed.  Shopping a powerful computer program to various dueling countries had promised to be the coup of Backman's glittering career - instead that spotlight brought him down.   Anyone with money wanted that program.  It would give the buyer sole control of a newly discovered system of spy satellites and limitless scope to keep an eye on just about everyone.  Backman's release isn't an act of kindness from the U.S. Government, it's a tactical move.  If they watch who goes after him, maybe they'll find out just who those mystery buyers might have been.  Also, who put those satellites up there in the first place, as Backman was never one for the telling. <br />  <br />There's not much thrilling about this thriller.  In large parts, \\"The Broker\\" seems only to be the author fondly recalling a memorable Italian holiday.    While the obligatory man on the run chase scenes are included, they make up the whole of the only exciting passages in this novel.  What could have been explored more thoroughly, such as the political maneuvers of the C.I.A. or the global bad guys battling for control is barely touched upon.  \\"The Broker\\" is a harmless, sometimes meandering read, one that may please Grisham fans who prefer the non-legal thrillers, and like the gentler literary avenues that Grisham has late been known to explore. <br />	2005-01-23

Dr Kay Scarpetta, medical examiner, returns to her former town of Richmond at the request of her successor, Dr Joel Marcus.  With her friend Pete Marino in tow, Scarpetta isn't made to feel welcome despite the invitation for her expertise.  Her former office has gone to the dogs and it angers the meticulous Scarpetta that such a highly regarded team of experts are managed by the remote, hands off political appointee Dr Marcus.  Not keen to be a scapegoat again, Scarpetta does some appointing and investigation of her own. <br />  <br />The murder of a young girl has somehow raised enough interest for Richmond to authorize the consulting of it's former chief medical examiner, the one they sacked sometime ago in a hail of political and beaurecratic fire.  Not only this, the F.B.I. are all over it too.  Meanwhile, Scarpetta's niece Lucy has her hands full dealing with a stalker who attacked her new lover and workmate, and she is not all comfortable in keeping this secret from her aunt.  Marino is on loan but the operations of \\"The Last Precinct\\" security firm are still attracting too much attention with their move to Florida.  There is a killer out there who is responsible for the death of young Jilly Paulson, and he also has a rather large grudge against his former boss, Dr Kay Scarpetta. <br />  <br />You have to agree with the fans on this one; \\"Trace\\" is a welcome return to forensic examination for Scarpetta and the book does make some attempt to home it's protagonist back in the morgue, albeit a borrowed one.  What you have though is a bunch of familiar people, acting completely out what we expected of their characters and a plot that gets buried once again in the high-tech and political shenanigans that frankly, don't interest the reader at all.  The Kay Scarpetta series was brilliant for so long, but that time ended a few books ago with the change in style and the introduction of too many incredible plotlines.  Author Patricia Cornwell should either find that Doctor of hers her own office to run again, her own cops to liaise with, or retire this series altogether.  It has become simply ridiculous reading.  The loved characters of Scarpetta and Marino are getting lost in unfamiliar surrounds and silly plots.   <br />  <br />\\"Trace\\" is the 13th book in this series. <br /> <br />	2005-01-21

The latest deviant that homicide Lieutenant Eve Dallas must chase down appears to be getting more out of his work than the thrill of the kill or perverse sexual satisfaction.  What is it that is making him pose the bodies post mortem for stylish, almost beautiful portrait shots?  Eve can see that her quarry is meticulous, careful and quite the sociopath.  What is driving his need to record his taking of a life?   <br />  <br />On the home front Eve faces another challenge in that final frontier of personal, unknown territories - her marriage. Never on firm ground in her only adult relationship to date (and this, is also questionable) Eve is flummoxed when her normally affectionate and sexually charged husband is blowing her off without reason, doing his own thing and not including her in his life.  Roarke has found out that his mother did not, in fact, dump him when he was a very young child.  The harridan that was there for the early years was not, in fact, his mother at all.    <br />  <br />Performing up to expectation, author Nora Roberts a.k.a. J.D. Robb delivers a screechingly fast read starring her two dynamos of the future, the super snarly Eve and the ravishing Roarke.  Not at all shabby at populating her novels with an array of eccentric, interesting characters, Robb particularly excels in this department with \\"Portrait in Death\\", the 16th entry in her bestselling \\"in Death\\" series.  A little realism finally creeps in, and it's a timely inclusion.  Roarke is not perfect all the time and even super cop Eve can have insecurities out of the workplace.  The hunt is well depicted and leaves the reader satisfied on all counts.  Yes, you get your love scenes as always.  If you're not already on the \\"in Death\\" wagon, \\"Portrait in Death\\" is an excellent example of just how much fun you are missing out on.	2004-12-07

His best buddy Win believes there's a lot of music Myron has to face - clients leaving in droves, upset family and friends, the usual array of thugs wanting to rearrange his pretty face and the news that his business partner and other best friend, Esperanza Diaz, has been charged with the murder.  The deceased happens to be a client too, so hey, double bad news. <br />  <br />What Myron can't understand is why Esperanza is shutting him out.  She's not allowing Myron or anyone connected with him to help find whoever it is that killed Clu Haid, recovering sports star and all round schmuck.  Those who know Esperanza well - yes they know she's capable but know that she wouldn't have done it.  One of MB Sportsrep's biggest clients had trusted Myron to take care of their newest recruit and said recruit winding up dead is not the best start to a business relationship.  Adding to the murk and chaos that is Myron's life is one missing girl.  Someone is anonymously pushing Myron to investigate, and it can't be a co-incidence that all roads are leading squarely back to number one, Mr Bolitar himself. <br />  <br />It just isn't possible to read a book of this series and not stock up on your witty one liners, coming away with the feeling that if you ever needed someone smart to hit the bars with, Harlan Coben and his snappy dialogue would be first choice.  Every page is full of the delicious smart aleck lines that Myron and Win effortlessly deliver, and all secondary characters are pretty quick on the delivery too.  \\"The Final Detail\\" is not the awesomely moving novel it has been described as, but it is a very good read in an excellent series.

Twelve jurors declare an accused murderer innocent, much to the public's disbelief and disgust.  Someone has taken it so personally that they're picking off all the members of that jury, one by one.  Shock radio jock Ian Zachary has cashed in on the public's ghoulish interest with the case, earning his show some super ratings and the kind of publicity that you couldn't ever pay for.  His ongoing game of \\"spot the juror\\" may get a lot of people killed as the killer tagged as \\"The Reaper\\" goes along his merry, murderous way - but in Zachary's own opinion, the public and everyone else is really only there to serve him, in any way that the egomaniac sees fit. <br />  <br />Not entirely sure whether the NYPD still has him in their employ or not, Detective Sgt. Riker spends the down hours managing a family business that gets him just as close to the evils that men and women can inflict on one another.  His specialist cleaning business takes away some of the horror by removing all the blood and gore and getting the client's house or place of business looking again pretty much the way it did before someone decided to commit a murder in it.   <br />  <br />Riker's former partner Kathy Mallory takes a personal offense in Riker's reluctance to return to the force; in particular as she disregards personal hurt once the obvious physical scars have healed.  Four bullets to the chest may have taken Riker down, but Mallory refuses to let that take him out of her world.  As the Reaper gets closer to eliminating the last of the twelve, Riker is drawn into the chase for very personal reasons.  One of those jurors is someone who has become very dear to him. <br />  <br />\\"Dead Famous\\" is not the thriller that it might sound - the killer hunting down a jury who delivered a verdict he violently disagreed with.  O'Connell's considerable talent is displayed here with the interaction of her characters and in particular the voice of Johanna Apollo, one of the jurors.  Some of the drama veersclose to the sob of melodrama but fortunately never crosses that line.  It's disturbing to hear how O'Connell refers to the character of Apollo repeatedly as a \\"hunchback\\" (the character has a spinal deformity) but if she is attempting to harden the reader to her fictional world of New York, she succeeds.  \\"Dead Famous\\" is the seventh novel in the Kathy Mallory series (also titled \\"The Jury Must Die\\" in other print editions), and features less of this female character as her lead in this book.  The intensity never lets up in this read, and those emotional punches just keep coming out one after the other. <br />	2004-12-05

LAPD Detective Petra Connor has been assigned a brilliant young intern named Isaac Gomez to baby-sit, and she suspects that it's only because she's a female detective.  The powers that be probably just hope that she'll be kind and keep a maternal eye out.  A drive-by shooting case is taking up all her time and she's not really open right now to the loose, though she's sure, statistically impeccable theories of her new sidekick.  Isaac has come up with a whole slew of murders that don't connect at all victim wise, but what they do have in common is the blunt force trauma used as the method of killing, and the date.  The murders all occurred in different years, but on the same day. <br />  <br />The new charms of fellow police officer Eric Stahl have other uses, as Eric stands in with Petra on one of his fleeting visits back to L.A.  Petra is getting rather used to working Homicide solo and earns the wrath of her superiors when she takes Eric along to visit a suspect.   Eric has to shoot to kill when Petra is threatened, which results in Petra being temporarily suspended from duty.  More time now to devote privately to Isaac's big theory, which is becoming more and more like the faded trail of a so far undetected serial killer.  As June 28 looms closer once again, Petra must prove firstly that there is such a killer, and secondly, stop him before the killing day arrives. <br />  <br />The character of Petra Connor previously starred in her own right in the 1998 novel \\"Billy Straight\\", and also appeared in \\"A Cold Heart\\", book number 17 in Kellerman's long running Alex Delaware series.  The character is more laid back than Kellerman's Dr Delaware, and really needs to be more compelling to hold the solo lead interest in a series novel.  The introduction of secondary character Isaac Gomez is an intriguing one, and the hope is that this new face will appear again, so well is the character written.  \\"Twisted\\" is a tightly constructed crime novel with its shared spotlight serving well to engage the reader in the various sub plots that manage to co-exist without taxing the memory too much.  The expected entanglement is there and of course it all works out in the end.  This book might not please some die-hard Delaware fans, but it should please just about everyone else.	2004-12-05

Celina Sanchez is a private consultant to the wealthy with personal problems and isn't at all used to having visions of a serial killer in action.  Eve isn't convinced that hiring Sanchez as a consultant will be worth the money, but she will take all and any offers of help.  <br />  <br />The public would be mightily freaked out if they knew all the details of the latest killing in the park.  The removal of the eyes, for instance.  Is the killer seeking recognition or are the victims more personal targets?  There's a man out there with serious problems with the fairer sex, and Eve is convinced that the way to flush him out is to present him publicly with the faces of his hunters - all women. <br />  <br />This great future police series starring New York police lieutenant Eve Dallas has been right up there in the best seller's list for the 18 books prior to \\"Visions in Death\\".  There had to be a flat one eventually, and this is it.  The series may at last be running out of puff as there isn't anything new to offer in this latest installment in the life and times of the snarly but brilliant Eve and her too perfect husband, Roarke.   <br />  <br />All the usual suspects feature with all their familiar and lovable quirks, but this novel is really only a time passer.  Still a good book, but compared its predecessors, \\"Visions in Death\\" is only average.  Good twist there at the end but it seems more of an afterthought in a rather pedestrian plot, saved by its characters and the updates for what's going on in their relationships.  Is there an end in sight for this series?   This book would seem to indicate we are due for the big wind up. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-28

A frightened phone call from Officer Trueheart has homicide Lieutenant Eve Dallas running to a crime scene with even more urgency than usual.  The keen rookie to homicide has killed a man, but he's not sure exactly how.  One Louie Cogburn had been beating the heck out of one of his neighbours when the call came through, and doing a fine job of it too.  One dead and another on the way to being in the same state until Officer Trueheart stepped in.  Was excessive force used to bring down the raging man?  Eve doesn't think so.  Interviewing one of the witnesses tells her that the stun delivered from the weapon of her officer wouldn't have been enough to kill, but maybe it was enough to trigger something else. <br />  <br />Can a computer virus be spread from unit to user?  An officer working on the unit pulled from the crime scene escalates from being irritated at the job into an out of control, psychotic rage.  Firing off his weapon at work Officer Halloway shoots down a fellow officer and takes hostage the captain of the electronics division, Eve's old mentor Feeney.  Eve manages to talk the hostage free of that situation, but the sick and enraged Officer Halloway doesn't make it.  <br />  <br />The usual gang all have their turn in \\"Purity in Death\\", the 15th novel in the best selling \\"in Death\\" series by author Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb.  There isn't too much you have to unravel mystery wise but there's enough going on in the personal avenues of the secondary characters to keep the interest up.  This novel suffers again from too much Roarke, as Eve's gorgeous and glamorous husband is seconded (yet again) into the service of the New York police.  Police procedures 2059 style are on show once again, with all the technological wonders of the imagined age stylishly presented.  Newbies might be a bit lost on this one as Robb does not bother this far into this series with the detailed explanations, but first contact with the fast and furious Eve Dallas should prove a welcome one.  Read, enjoy, and then mostly forget. <br /> <br />	2004-11-19

What an amazing thirty year journey this has been for followers of the Dark Tower series.  Stephen King had no idea of how it all would end when he began but now that we seen what is at the top of the Dark Tower, we can reflect that Roland may have known, in his darkest of hearts, all along.   After you have perhaps shut the book and cried, or picked it up off the floor from where you have thrown it in frustration, open it once again and read the last words from the author. It might come to you, as it did to this reader, that this was the only possible conclusion to Roland's epic quest.   <br />  <br />Roland and his ka-tet do not have an easy path in their final days.  Father Pere Callahan (formerly, of 'Salems Lot), Jake Chambers and the bumbler Oy must brave the vampires of the court, gathered to feast at the Dixie Pig.  They are trying to find Susannah, who was taken by the followers of the Crimson King to have her dan-tete Mordred, by way of Mia, the lost woman-child.  Roland Deschain, the original gunslinger, and Eddie Dean, of New York travel to the one other world where time only moves in one direction.  They must find and protect the writer, who has a date with destiny - a drunk driver and a ditch, to be precise.  Their creator, Stephen King. <br />  <br />The two remaining Beams are failing.  Breakers from various times have been given what they've always wanted and herded into mid World to practice their telepathy and destructive powers on the Beams that connect at the nexus of all worlds, The Dark Tower.  The Crimson King wishes complete destruction and is all too aware that the traveler with the all-seeing eyes of uncertain age is coming determinedly towards him.  Roland means to throw him from the balcony of the Tower that will not give him entry. <br />  <br />\\"The Dark Tower\\" delivers on tying up all of its loose ends and giving us closure for all the characters we've met on the way through its seven novels.  As most fans would know, the Dark Tower is referred to in almost all of King's works, and has been the weight the author has borne throughout his career.  This is a bloody novel and a frustrating one. King has thrown in everything that he has into this final work, which makes for a dense pile of matter that requires a sharp memory of all his other Tower works.  The jargon might drive you nuts, or the interminable slowness that creeps into the first few hundred pages.  The heart stopping stuff kicks in at the half way mark and will carry you both painfully and joyfully through to the most final of endings. <br />  <br />It is difficult to think of a body of work (excluding the single and obvious comparison to Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\") that is more complex or convoluted than King's Dark Tower series.  It has required a hell of a lot of faith and love to make it this far, and only the individual could decide if the journey made it all worthwhile.  For this reader, it has been about a twenty year trip with Roland Deschain and his friends.  They will be sadly missed and never, ever forgotten. <br /> <br />	2004-11-19

DC Sharpe expects to be drunk on at least one particular night of the year and to wake up rotten with the aftertaste of memories meshing into her nightmares.  When one of the victims of a double murder turns out to be her chief officer, Karen is called in to view the crime scene and assist with the investigation.  Detective Sergeant Leech has been executed, and not in a tidy fashion so the investigating officers accept that his former partner would look more than a little upset and queasy after viewing his body.  But it's not a squeamish stomach or a grieving heart that is worrying Karen Sharpe. <br /> <br />Karen was meant to be at that midnight rendezvous, meeting with a young female informant who was the other victim of that night.  DS Leech had gone instead, due to Karen's drunken state and was killed.  Was he murdered in place of her, and for what reason?  Detective Chief Superintendent John Munro places Karen on the investigative team, hoping that she can help provide evidence to bring about a conviction on a local drug dealer that they have in their sights.  Karen knows this is not a dealer or an ex boyfriend of the deceased informant out for revenge.  It has to do with her own past, people she still fears, and how far she has come to re-invent herself. <br /> <br />Interesting that this is the first novel in an expected series for two reasons.  One; the ending is quite ambiguous and two; the lead character in DC Sharpe is not what you would expect in a recurring lead.  Sharpe is a strong, driven woman with a past that was essential in providing the needed twist in \\"Phoenix\\".  It's difficult to see, from the shrapnel lying about at the end of this novel where the character will go and on which side of the law she will be walking.  With baggage, or without?  <br /> <br />\\"Phoenix\\" starts off brilliantly as a detailed police procedural then wings off to the left with as the possibility of terrorism is introduced into what would seem a drugs related murder investigation.  The two sides of the story never quite seem to meld successfully, and the secondary plot seems an afterthought in addition to the first to add some snap.  Lots of supposedly smart police doing very dumb things don't help to wind up the tension which comes too late into play to be effective. <br /> <br />Promise here for some good reading in future works with this writer but sadly \\"Phoenix\\" falls just shy of being what you'd describe as a gripping read. <br />	2004-11-19

As with the three preceding novels, Gerritsen features the same main characters while changing the viewpoint from which the action is relayed.  It works extremely well, as you have a sense of familiarity while having the ability to explore in greater depth those you have encountered previously in her work.  Gerritsen seems to know where that borderline is with horrified fascination, to the turn off kind of horror.  Remaining on the right side of it at all times, Gerritsen writes a blazingly good story with plenty of evil chills to enthrall her audience.<br /><br />This is one author who is just hitting her stride.  Gerritsen remains one to watch and if \\"Body Double\\" hasn't already made it into your hands, the recommendation is that it finds its way there, sooner rather than later.one to watch and if \\"Body Double\\" hasn't already made it into your hands, the recommendation is that it finds its way there, sooner rather than later. <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-10-25

The first time police officer Eve Dallas put the husband murdering Julianna Dunne away it was with a great sense of satisfaction.  The lovely Ms Dunne promised to make it all even between herself and the only female member of the investigative team.  She's had plenty of time in prison to plan it all meticulously.  A number of poisoning deaths brings the attention that she wants - and the chase between the now Lieutenant Dallas and the killer begins. <br />  <br />After speaking to Dunne's fellow inmates, Eve is sure she knows Dunne's next target.  Eve's husband is a man more than capable of taking care of himself but that is no reassurance to a wife who has seen the efficient kills that Dunne can perform without feeling.  Looking into Dunne's past involves a return to Dallas, where Eve Dallas began and the abused child of her past was left behind.  Just one more hurdle to face as she hunts a killer down in order to protect what belongs solely to her.  Her husband of one year, Roarke. <br />  <br />Roarke and Eve partner up so many times in this series it's about time they gave the man a badge of his own.  \\"Reunion in Death\\" (re) introduces us once again to future living, New York style, and it's done as always extremely well.  If you've made it this far into the series you would already be an established fan of Robb's strong characterization and extremely quotable dialogue.  If you're a newbie this one might throw you as Robb doesn't always bother with the explanations.

Daniel Cambridge observes life on the block.  He rarely actually moves off his block, as that would entail crossing the wide open spaces, perhaps encountering the unfamiliar and the undesirable. If the kerbs don't have a flattened space to cross onto, he isn't doing it.  Life gets complicated too when you have a yearning for people who don't live on your block.  The local pharmacist Zandy is in both ways accessible and inaccessible as at least he can physically make it to her store.   But he reserves a greater love for the local real estate agent, and then there are his in home visits from a psych in training.  In training for what isn't certain to Daniel, but he feels he gives good value to the cause. <br /> <br />Crippled by anxieties that rigidly control and suppress his life, Daniel is his own captor.  Aware of that yet not certain how to change, Daniel lives for the small interactions with others.  It was quite something to be briefly questioned when Bob from downstairs was murdered.  As if, he was capable of interacting with another to such an uncontrolled degree.  Life begins to change in small increments when he wins a contest for the \\"Most Average American\\".  It's almost funny when he wins it twice, but how is he going to explain that one away? <br /> <br />This is almost a one room story with Daniel and his limitations being the stars.  Daniel's various compulsions and concerns are pretty irritating to read about in such fine detail and I'm not entirely convinced that collectively they create enough substance to qualify as an entertaining read.  This is a study in minute detail of (presumably) obsessive compulsive disorder, paranoia and anxiety attacks that have bound one man up in a multi-faceted and complicated universe of his own making.  Steve Martin always manages to have his character maintain his dignity and sense of self under fire, as overestimated as that fire may be.  This novel will get the sympathetic smiles if not the laughs. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-10-16

Rookie FBI agent Kimberley Quincy is keeping it all in the family, for the family.  Her father was once an agent himself, and now works as a consultant back to the authorities he once served.  Both of them will always carry hurt.  Kimberley's sister and mother were killed by someone who was supposed to be their friend, innocently brought into their tight family circle by an unsuspecting Kimberley.   Joining the FBI to fight out her demons, and preferably with a nice big gun at hand, seemed like a good idea at the time. <br />  <br />Veering off the jogging path at Quantico, Kimberley finds the body of a young woman and with that finds the mission she has been unwittingly looking for.  The military police do not want to attach the kill to someone who works on the base of the academy.  A visiting agent from the Georgia Bureau knows immediately that this kill is the work of a killer he has been chasing for years, a deviant known as the Eco-Killer.  This killer always hunts for pairs, and this time he has outdone himself.  The victim had been out on the town the night she disappeared with not one, but three other friends.  They are all missing.  From experience Agent Michael McCormack knows he has to find the clues on the body that will lead him to the next victim - who will be already dying. <br />  <br />This is one of those thrillers that if you could enhance some aspects of the read (the captive scenes) and delete other inclusions (blah romance that was totally unnecessary) you would come up with an ideal read.  Lisa Gardner excels in getting inside the minds of her victims and gives them their own starring roles, ensuring you never forget what all this frenetic clock-ticking activity is all about - saving someone's life.  The tension as it all comes to a head near conclusion is of the fingernail biting variety.  There's plenty of relationship sub plots going on to distract you from the chase, but knowing that someone will die unless the good guys get their acts together will always drive you forward.  A highly entertaining read, not at all gritty but with plenty of the human drama that makes it all work well. <br />	2004-10-10

It's the scattered roses, the wine, and the romantic setting in the victim's apartment which makes Eve think that this particular jumper hardly had reason to jump.

Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) is just so darn good at drawing characters, racking out that punchy dialogue and hooking you into caring about her future world of the year 2059 that you just might not care about this too much.  The focus of the series has moved away from police investigation, future style, and has become more about her growing stable of fictional stars. <br />  <br />This series would be recommended to any kind of reader as it is just so much fun.  Consider it your crime reading sorbet, as it freshens you up to take another slug at something more dark and forensic.  Nora Roberts could probably set her series any old place and time and you'd still like it as it is so cleverly done.  \\"Seduction in Death\\" is book number lucky thirteen in the ridiculously successful \\"in Death\\" series, featuring the snarly and dedicated police Lieutenant Eve Dallas.

He happens to be there for a charity event that very night with his wife.  It's handy that his Eve is a cop at times like this. <br />  <br />Mining the resources of her colleagues and Roarke's untraceable sources, Eve quickly discovers that the killer is a hit man for hire, and not cheap either.  So why would he bother with a woman who seems to have bothered no one at all in her young life?  Looking for reasons for the killing brings Eve full circle - back to Roarke.  As she knew he would, Roarke he takes the killing of a employee very personally.  The self made zillionaire has a lot on the go at the moment on and off planet so it's not a good time for distractions.  Who is the real target? <br />  <br />Twelve novels down and J.D. Robb still manages to keep the relationship between her hero and heroine sharp, despite the amount of time they spend together, and much of that annoying each other.  It brings its own failures in that every novel of this series now is all to do about the same issues - someone always after Roarke, the kills always tied to him in some manner.  Time for some new directions, despite how much page time is gratefully granted to such a terrific character (and let's not forget the marital sex scenes, always tastefully done). <br />  <br />Crime wise \\"Betrayal in Death\\" falls a little flat, and seems to be riding on the established strengths of a very popular series.

The ones that have been left must band together to cross the earth and begin a new life.  The first place they head to is Babylon. <br />  <br />The science fiction concept of paradoxes in this novel is handled with a very light hand.  Spending time with your future self, for example, is not considered impossible.  A generally accepted belief is that with messing with time's events, in effect making a new past, you will change future events and delete happenings, possibly preventing individuals from ever coming into being.  Perhaps this aspect that will be dealt with a little more credibly in future novels of this new series.  The combination of Clarke and Baxter, two legendary giants of science fiction has worked well to create an interesting new novel that promises many new adventures on a as yet unexplored new landscape - recreated earth.  The possibilities \\"Time's Eye\\" presents would seem to be endless and are its strength as opposed to the somewhat flat characterization.   A good start to a new series and a good run also for readers new to either author, but who would like to broaden their reading horizons a little. <br /><br />	2004-10-05

A baseball bat has been used on the off-duty officer who was working nights at a local strip joint called \\"Purgatory\\".  For a man known to have no enemies, the brutality of his killing stuns everyone.  It takes some serious digging from Eve and her sidekick Officer Peabody to find a connection to the notorious Max Ricker.  The death of another officer suspected to be on the take to Ricker links the two cases to police internal affairs who would like the whole investigation squashed.   Add a troubled police captain into the mix, and there's a whole lot of people who feature on Eve's suspect list. <br />  <br />The relationship scenes in \\"Judgment in Death\\" are some of the best in the series.  If you are an Eve and Roarke fan you'll delight in the spats the dynamic duo have with the additional element of a third party -Eve's pre-marital one night stand, Webster.  The crime plotline meanders to the point that a resolution is just a bonus. Robb is at the top of her form here when it comes to her created 2058 environment of New York and the sharp, witty characters she has populated it with.  Great fun read for fans and would definitely hook in the new reader who has heard great things of the romantic suspense contained in the hugely successful '\\"in Death\\" series. <br />  <br />	2004-10-01

Tess and her family chose a life by the sea, in a small Suffolk town.  A safe town, a good place to work and to raise your children.  As Tess begins to recover from baby number four, a crack is made right down the centre of the cocooned, quaint world in which she lives.   Lennie, mother of two, liked by everyone, best friend to Tess and hubby Mick, has been murdered.  No clues and no suspects.  It's only known that the killer was fast and brutal.  Lennie is attacked at a beach side carpark after a local committee meeting, her heart cut from her chest and taken away. <br />  <br />Lennie leaves behind two boys and her husband Alex, an old flame to Tess from her pre-family days.  As the whole town is watchful, the character of it changes.  Tess begins to query the stability of her own marriage as the blinkers are taken off what might have seemed her happy life.  A police liaison is called in to assist the family, and it is this new face who judges Tess not as a wife or a new mother.  Tess is pulled between this possible new love with Lacey and the ties that bind her inexplicably to her already fragile family.  When two of her children claim to see Lennie watching them from a distance, Tess is pulled back with a jolt to realize who it is that always will suffer the most. <br />  <br />The \\"Something Might Happen\\" idea is that Tess cannot overstep the boundaries of her position, in case things will change.  The death of her best friend has taken some of the control away and is down this slippery slope upon which Tess begins to slide.  There is no direct speech in this novel so you are privy to all and only the thoughts, worries and concerns of Tess.  That limits the read somewhat, and lessens the suspenseful element.  The character of Tess is not remarkable, yet completely believable as she views the aftermath of a violent event on the lives of her neighbours and loved ones.  \\"Something Might Happen\\"  is a slow moving novel exploring the ripple effect of crime in a small town with no corners of the psyche remaining unexplored. <br />	2004-09-27

For the young and rich at Harvard Law School, parties that went on for days in the 1960's were common.   Of course, nothing too scandalous that would come back to haunt you when you became part of the rich and legal elite and whatever secrets there were - well, they were expected to be kept hidden for the good of all.  A law school reunion brings all the players together, with the guest of honor being one of their own.  The heir to a fortune, the odd member of their group from their university days went on to become the Vice President of the United States. <br /> <br />Thomas Stern Browning has made a request of his old school friend, Joseph Antonelli.  Forty years ago, at a party held at the Plaza Hotel, a young woman fell to her death.  Though loved by all that met her, Annie Malreaux had two suitors at the time who were desperately in love with her and both were at the Plaza when she died.  In the present day, a murder case is brought before the court; the result of which will put one of these men in jail and end the rising career of the other.  Browning has only one more step to go before he reaches his ultimate political goal, and there are many who would like to stop him getting here.  Defense attorney Joseph Antonelli must dig into the past that they all share to end the nightmare of the present.   <br /> <br />D.W. Buffa undoubtedly has an elegant and meticulous style of writing.  Infusing his latest work with a melancholic air Buffa has written a sombre novel of regret and lost love.  The courtroom scenes do not take up a lot of time in \\"Breach of Trust\\" though the novel could be aptly described as a legal and political drama.  What detracts from the read is the pompous speeches of the characters and the inherent selfishness common to most of the major players.  It's difficult to care one way or another what happens to there ultra urbanized souls who spend all their time in cities and around people that they all secretly seem to despise. <br /> <br />\\"Breach of Trust\\" is the author's sixth novel featuring Joseph Antonelli.  This work serves well as a standalone but seems more of concluding piece than an entry in a continuing series.  If you don't let the darkness drag you down you will appreciate the careful deliberations that have led to the present day conflict in this thoughtful and unsettled novel.	2004-09-14

The first night out at the theatre for Lieutenant Eve Dallas brings it all home to familiar territory.   A murder mystery by Agatha Christie has been Roarke's choice for the needed cultural introduction to Eve's life, and when you own pretty much half the planet, naturally you would choose to visit one of your own theatres.  One small hitch; the stabbing scene looks a little too real because it is.  The lead actor has been stabbed to death in front of a live audience and while there are plenty of witnesses to the act, no one knows who made that switch of the knife to commit murder. <br />  <br />With Eve's prime suspects being actors, there isn't much she can read from them that gives her clues on where to start hunting for the killer behind the facade.  In fact, too many possible suspects each with their own reasons to despise the deceased create more wrong turns than leads for Eve and her colleagues Peabody, Feeney and McNab to follow.  <br />  <br />Reminded at every turn at just how lucky she is to have such a man as the gorgeous Roarke, the man handbag every woman in the year 2058 wouldn't mind having,  Eve decides to take some time out from a wearying murder investigation to give a little appreciation back to her husband. <br />  <br />Ten novels on in the \\"in Death\\" series and author Nora Roberts (writing as J.D. Robb) does a sterling job at keeping the romance seekers happy.  While the big clanger remains to be revealed in future novels (who Eve really is), \\"Witness in Death\\" provides enough of the romantic warm and fuzzies between our heroic couple to keep the fires burning.  The future New York described here (the setting of this series) is the best peek at our future urban life that you could hope to find out there in the wide world of fiction.   A nice little nod to the mistress of the craft, that being Christie, is granted in this novel and with a little updating, you can see that Eve is following an investigative process that originated back in those days.   Great reading, nothing too cerebral, and another must read entry in a must read series. <br />  <br />	2004-09-13

Sixteen little tales here of the mysterious and the murderous.  An author perhaps best known for his series of excellent forensic crime novels, Jeffery Deaver serves us up a little smorgasbord of the conniving, the calculating, the two-faced and your average garden-variety suburban serial killer.  Delivering a nice spin on the good guy being really quite bad, and the classic scenario of the cheating spouse finding out what else can be done with his cheating heart - they're all there for you. <br />  <br />This is perhaps the kind of book that would be handy as your travel companion.  Reading it all the way through, with some crime writing twists used repeatedly in successive stories -  this doesn't result in what you'd consider to be an entire book of gripping reading.  Read separately the stories in \\"Twisted\\" serve to entertain for those reading on the run times or as a backup book when you can't get into your current novel read. <br />  <br />Included in this short story collection is a little Christmas piece featuring Lincoln Rhyme and the usual gang of suspects, teaming their efforts to help find a missing woman.  This would probably provide enough of an entry point for fans.  There's more than one little surprise in this book for the reader who likes their mysteries short and sharp with Deaver delivering more than a few clever about-faces that you don't see coming. <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-08-29

Deborah St James is insistent that her old friend China Rivers could not possibly have committed a murder.  Her husband, Simon, simply must see this too and help her find out who really killed Guy Brouard.  Deborah's old friend is an American, travelling with her brother as the unlikely couriers of business papers that happened to have a cash bonus thrown in with a couple of free air tickets.  On the island of Guernsey the murder victim was the local unofficial lord, known for charitable acts and somewhat controlling patronage of a select few.  <br />  <br />When the will of the late Guy Brouard is read, it is not only the family that have cause for upset.  On the night before his death, Brouard threw a party detailing his final plans for a war museum that was to be built, honoring in particular those who died during the Nazi occupation of Guernsey in the Second World War.  It seems that to go ahead with the museum was never the plan, and where on earth haves all the riches of the deceased millionaire gone?   <br /> <br />Not much seems to fit in this read.  You have the peculiar but not terribly interesting method of a murder.  You also have the fact that the stars of this literary crime series, Inspector Thomas Lynley and Sergeant Barbara Havers do not actually appear (Lynley has a few pages for plot assistance only).  This novel is very different from the others in this series and the length of 600 plus pages does not necessarily mean a richer and more rewarding conclusion for your reading efforts.  The wrap up doesn't make much sense and seems to have been pulled out of a bag for the purpose of closure and so that we could call this a crime novel.  Well, there had to be a murder somewhere. <br />  <br />Elizabeth George is a member of a very small group of the more literary crime writers who excel in detailing all the finer points.  \\"A Place of Hiding\\" seems to have strayed too far from the idea of a murder mystery, if that was the intention.  George is an excellent writer but with her twelfth novel in this series, \\"A Place of Hiding\\", her work does not go far enough to showcase that extraordinary talent. <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-08-28

Dressing up to the nines to try and win back her wayward husband, Sara Linton's friendly trip to the local police station turns into a day long nightmare.  Trapped inside the offices with the staff and a group of school children doing a tour, Sara finds herself a hostage along with a wounded Jeffrey when two gunmen open fire.  They want to know that that they've killed Police Chief Jeffrey Tolliver.  What they don't know is that the wounded man in Sara's arms was actually their target. <br />  <br />Twelve years ago when Sara and Jeffrey were in the early stages of dating, their relationship underwent a trial by fire.  Visiting Jeffrey's home town for the first time Sara finds out much about his family and friends that she'd rather not know about.  Jeffrey's best friend shoots and kills an intruder into his home and the couple are the first on the scene.  Robert's claims don't ring true and neither, to Sara, do Jeffrey's.  Is he covering up for his best friend and leading her away from he fears really happened, or is he now orchestrating events to suit only himself? <br />  <br />If you can get past the dreadful first chapter on this book, an increasing momentum should carry you the rest of the way.   As half of this book is set in the shared past of Jeffrey and Sara, yes, it is good to be able to see how they ended up together and upon what base their relationship has been built on.  The current day crisis is a heck of a lot more interesting though than seeing the younger Jeffery behave pretty much as the older one continues to do so - that being badly - and it would have been perhaps wiser to ease off from that focus and include more hostage tension.  <br />  <br />\\"Indelible\\" is the fourth book in the Grant County series which is becoming more like a drama read than that of a suspense thriller.  If you thought this novel's predecessor, \\"A Faint Cold Fear\\" was at times sillier than it was fearful, you might have the same feelings towards \\"Indelible\\".   Author Karin Slaughter can undoubtedly write well so that \\"Indelible\\" could be considered a solid \\"filler\\" read in this series - a series that started off brilliantly and seems to have lost its edge along the way.   <br />  <br />	2004-08-27

Major Jack Reacher of the Military Police has only been back from a Panama hotspot a couple of days so he doesn't anticipate a drunkenly happy New Year's celebration in Fort Bird, North Carolina.  On duty while it seems the rest of the world parties the arrival of 1990, Jack receives a call that a two star general has exited the New Year in a different fashion.  Is it the seedy hotel the general is found dead in or the fact that he passed away while doing the horizontal tango with an unknown partner -well, the army needs an officer to attend.   <br /> <br />Jack's new bosses on the base aren't keen for him to delve into this one and there's plenty of cause for concern.  What's lacking from the scene is the general's briefcase, containing who knows what sensitive material.  Finding the man's wife murdered two states away in her home, Jack, with the help of another officer, Lieutenant Summers, begins to conduct an investigation under the radar of his superiors.  Only partially successful there, Jack is immediately in everyone's sights.  You don't question the moves of the U.S. Army colonels and generals.  Moves recently undertaken to reposition key members of the army evacuated from Panama only creates a whole new list of questions from Jack.  It's all connected, and it's all bad. <br /> <br />\\"The Enemy\\" is essentially a prequel to the Jack Reacher series.  We get to see some of what made Jack the man he is with this novel filling in some blanks from his army days when he was a member of the military police.  Less action and more deliberate consideration make this novel somewhat slower in pace than its predecessors.  While you're not reading a suspense thriller for a dose of reality, you still might find  young Major Reacher flying here there and everywhere at the expense of the U.S. Army and his work schedule (or lack thereof) being completely at the dictation of his own whims a little hard to process.  Then again, if you've wanted to see a little more of what makesour Jack tick, this is the book for you if you can accept the read of less thrills and spills. <br /> <br />It will be interesting to see in what direction book number nine takes, as the next entry in this series.  Tightly plotted and written in Child's usual sparse, tense narrative, \\"The Enemy\\" is an essential read for a Reacher follower and may just be the catalyst for a new reader to hook up to a new hero. <br /> <br />	2004-08-23

They might be ridiculous demands but the threats aren't mere threats and the New York police of the year 2058 find themselves knee deep in bodies as the city's well-known buildings are targets for bombings. <br />  <br />It began with a murder of a man by his cuckolded mistress and ends with a city in hostage.  Eve and her fellow police officers are racing against the clock to find out the true identities of the puppet masters that hide behind a paper trail of false company fronts.  \\"Cassandra\\" claims to be an organization with many zealous members, but Eve has the feeling that it may all boil down to just one fanatic with a heck of a lot of scary friends. <br />  <br />Firing on all cylinders from where we left her at the end of the previous novel, Lieutenant Dallas cuts through the garbage with her customary snarling style and brutal effectiveness.  The usual suspects are there to assist, and we get a great sub plot happening with her assistant Peabody that has been on the boiler for the last few books in this series.  Husband Roarke lives another day, just, to win a few more hearts and snag a few more romantic fans into this best selling series that defies pigeonholing.  Author Nora Roberts a.k.a. J.D.

Joanna and Walter look forward to building a new life for themselves and their two children in the picture-book perfect town of Stepford.  This is the town where everyone is friendly, all of the women are beautiful and the men the kind who cordially take themselves off to a men's only club every night to leave their good women to indulge themselves in a little superfluous house cleaning.  It takes Joanna only a short while to decide that these domestic goddesses couldn't possibly be entirely happy with their lot.  Indeed, it was entirely unnatural it is for a modern woman of the sixties to be so concerned about the state about her waxed floors.   <br />  <br />Her new friend in the town, Bobbie, agrees with Joanna's observations and the two decide to take action.  The men's club must be changed from within, so Walter bravely sallies forth to do just that.  The two women tackle the local house wives, flummoxed that their friendly and helpful overtures to begin a women's group are rejected so soundly in favour of the glamour of toilet cleaning and floor mopping.  When Bobbie changes overnight into a somewhat robotic wife just like the rest of the women of Stepford, Joanna is certain that her time will come.  Who will be converting her, and when will it happen?  She must escape. <br />  <br />This classic short suspense novel has earnt its place in pop culture; how many times have you heard someone say \\"sheesh, it's like living in Stepford\\" or \\"well, she's definitely a Stepford wife, put it that way\\"?  Most of the horror is of the slowly dawning variety and skillfully done so that the worst of it is left up to your own grubby little imagination.  The story is a little dated with its references of the times and quite different from the movie re-makes, particularly the second if you've caught that one this year.  Don't hang yourself up on the little inaccuracies - what you take away from this one depends on the kind of person you are and your own beliefs and so it is easy to see how this novel stirred up so much dinner party conversation upon its release in the 1970's.  Consider it one of those books that you really MUST read if you haven't done so already and add this short and snazzy little number to your own little literary repertoire. <br />  <br />Author Ira Levin also wrote the best selling novels \\"The Boys from Brazil\\", \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and \\"A Kiss before Dying\\". <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-08-09

Everyone who's anybody knows that Bernie is never completely out of the game, and when the request comes from a friend to clean out the wall safe of an established rogue, it is not that hard a decision to make. Success comes with careful planning, so prior reconnaissance of the site is a must. But perhaps not a terribly good idea to make an unplanned stop while doing a little forward scouting for the job.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> The impulse stops comes in the form of an unknown woman's apartment, and while it was a good idea at the time of entry it rapidly ceases to be so. The occupant returns and Bernie finds himself hiding under the bed, listening to a rape in progress. While it has a bit of a grim beginning, the blip on the morality radar is smoothed over and the story introduces a cast of thousands all somehow connected with a double murder committed in the neighbourhood Bernie is caught appraising on street security cameras. Wrong man, wrong time and Bernie is once again in the thick of it. <br />  <br />  <br />  <br /> &quot;Burglar on the Prowl&quot; is the tenth entry in the Bernie Rhodenbarr series. The self-deprecating wit of Bernie the burglar is the main appeal of this novel, and while the resolution is quite masterful in its complexity, you might find its method of delivery all a bit too hard and serious to take in. Author Lawrence Block proves his versatility in writing a series so different from his other works that you could more easily believe they were crafted by different authors.

Ty's peace is disturbed and he is made aware of the raw edge between life and human death when a group of refugees, led by the crusading Lila, make camp in his surrounds and demand help for their collective survival.<br />Ty's emotional bank is drained with the shared responsibility of keeping over 400 souls alive and his re-emergence into the company of others leads him into dealing with Bud van Sickle, CEO of Timbuktu Earthwealth.  The nations of the world  need somewhere to store their burgeoning masses of nuclear waste, and Timbuktu Earthwealth want Ty's assistance in the process of selling their idea to the world community of burying this waste in the desert.  In effect, in return for the company assisting the refugees, Ty agrees to become an industrial spy.<br />While the effortless comparative similies remain, after the introduction of conflict on an industrial and political scale the novel departs the previously winning formula and battles for purpose.  Local warlords, environmental crusaders, political middle men and traffickers are introduced at such pace it becomes convoluted and an effort to follow.  Every introduced character seems to be a mystic and after the purity of the opening pages the novel seems cluttered and somewhat inconsequential despite the grandness of its setting.<br />The working credentials of this debut author impress detail in to what could be described as a technical novel that works hard at crafting for our minds one possible future for Africa.  \\"Desert Burial\\" is difficult to classify, in parts excellent literaryfiction and in others, industrial thriller.
