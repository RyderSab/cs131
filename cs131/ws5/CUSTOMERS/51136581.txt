In the past I've owned guides for Florida, Arizona, The Carolinas and Spain. So I assumed that this would be a good one. I was partly wrong. It has some beautiful pictures, for sure. But if what you are after is a guide to point you to the off-the-beaten-path places, if you want to drive away from the routes of the tour buses, this is not the right book for you. The tours it recommends are not too different from regular sightseeing experiences, so what's the point of driving the same routes that you can have someone drive for you?<br /><br />If you are the adventurer type, you're much better off getting a copy of the Frommer's Spain book or the Michelin Guide. They will provide you with a wealth of details and tips that will enrich your travel plans.	2005-10-11

We have found it to be an excellent vacation planning tool in our trip to Spain. With details ranging from where to stay for less money with the most value, to places to go eat/visit and things to avoid too, the book has something for everyone with Spain in their travel plans. We have used Frommer's guides for 5 different places so far, and not one of them has dissapointed us. This one was no exception. Highly recommended.	2005-09-16

After all, I wondered, how much can you write about handling tough questions. The answer is: \\"a lot!\\" And Weissman, with his 20+ years of experience consulting about this, sure knows every bit of it, as acknowledged by a host of prominent leaders in the book jacket and in this product page.<br /><br />In a balanced fashion, Weissman takes the reader through a thorough methodology that can be easily replicated (not without practice, of course), by quoting legendary moments, mostly from debates, where the speaker did well and also where he didn't do as well. He ties in his methodology to elements taken from the martial arts, almost to the point of turning the whole framework into an art itself.<br /><br />For those concerned about political biases here, fear not. The author grants just as much credit to Reagan as he does to Clinton, as masters of this art. He is also able to praise Gore and G.W. Bush over their improved their debating skills after also pointing out their earlier shortcomings. He \\"topspins\\" an already great book, by dedicating the last chapter entirely to a leader he considers a role model in terms of his ability to handle tough questions: General Schwarzkopf, the commander-in-chief of Desert Storm in 1991.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is the best business techniques book I have had a chance to read since \\"Death by Meeting\\" by Patrick M. Lencioni. Get it.	2005-08-08

Prior to that, my experience was one with Web Design and Project Management. Little did I know what was ahead for me. The challenges that I ran into were many and I was fortunate to count with the help of some great users of the community who volunteered their help and expertise to help us steer through them.<br /><br />If I had taken the time to research and ran into \\"Design for Community: The Art of Connecting Real People in Virtual Places\\", prior to the design and launch of the community, I would have definitely implemented many of the pieces of advice it offers. I started reading this book only a week ago, and within hours of grabbing it, I was finding things I could apply to our community to address some of the pending issues that needed to be solved.<br /><br />This is one of those books I won't stop recommending to anyone with the task of designing a site to host an online community, and then those tasked with managing it. Its advice, though a bit dated in some places, is priceless and timeless for the most part.	2005-07-26

I Built My Own Web Site\\" by Zohar Amihud is a book arguably written for young teenagers. It consists of two parts: Building a Web Site and Web Site Hosting.<br /><br />By all means Part I results tailored for the 11-17 demographic (and I'd even argue it's appropriate for children under 10, considering how advanced kids are these days). It covers most of the basics of HTML: basic tags, images, color, tables and it even gets your feet wet with iFrames (embedding HTML found in one file into another file, for display of things such as menus in multiple places in a web site). This chapter is written in a language that caters better to children (I can imagine some teenagers feeling like they're been talked to as kids, as they read this part).<br /><br />Part II, however, I found to be more elevated in its language, and begins to depart from the level of Part I. There are a large number of technical matters covered in it that deal with making the right decision for the hosting of your web site. However, I can't avoid but feeling as if it's part of a completely different book.<br /><br />As a whole, it's a nice book to get for children who want to build their first web site in plain HTML (not using commercial tools or wizards). If you take away the \\"Look what I did, Mom!\\" factor, it may also work as a very basic reference for HTML newbies in general (young and old).	2005-06-25

We are all businesspeople.	\\"We are all Zen students. We are all businesspeople.\\" This is how the first section of this book opens. As for me, I am a Manager. Also I am a person in search for answers in my spiritual life, and I am seeking into Buddhism for those answers. This combination led me to read by pure accident an ad on Shambhala Sun magazine (highly recommendable, if you are into Buddhism, by the way) that featured Marc Lesser's Z.B.A. I ordered it and it didn't take long for me to get hooked on it.<br /><br />Walking the reader through means of achieving the Buddhist Eightfold Path while at work, the book offers a refreshing perspective on how to bridge the gap between our \\"work lives\\" and our \\"personal lives\\", if such a dychotomy makes any sense whatsoever. A good example of how these two things are in essence one and the same is what Lesser makes of the purpose of Zen: \\"The purpose of Zen and the purpose of business practice is to develop and open, flexible mind, a mind that can deal with a world that is both solid and completely impermanent.\\"<br /><br />In the end, there are so many fascinating elements proposed by the author, that I cannot avoid but to feel sorry for having finished the book. I almost feel like re-reading it, and I do recommend that you check it out.	2005-06-20

If you want highlights, you got them: best beaches, best golf courses, best resorts, etc. If you want detail, you can go into as much of it as you care for.<br /><br />We live in Central Florida, and it's been extremely useful to help us plan one-day outings as well as longer vacations. It will help you learn about the lesser known locations as well as give you details and tips you didn't know about the popular ones. It truly is a helpful guide equally for tourists or Florida residents.	2005-06-06

One of the things you learn with Dr. Bernstein's book is that excessive eating (even when you don't overeat carbs, but other food types) leads to high sugars, due to the so-called \\"Chinese Restaurant Effect\\". Well, if you were to devour this hefty book (like you will, once you get your hands on it) you will not see your blood sugar rise. If you are a diabetic (type I or II), you will find in Dr. Bernstein's book a wealth of information that will answer the questions you've ALWAYS had, and even those that you didn't know you had, about diabetes and how to keep your blood sugars in control.<br /><br />His approach is very unconventional (coming from a diabetic childhood, being an engineer first and a doctor later in life). But you will be fascinated with the amount of \\"Eureka!\\" moments throughout the book. I was unable to put it down from the moment I picked it up, and I am grateful to him for having taken the time to share so much wisdom from his years as a practitioner and from his many, many years as a diabetic and experimenter. His lessons are not easy to follow, but they are the way for those who want to live a long and healthy life with diabetes.<br /><br />I leave you with a thought. If you knew what you need to do to prolong your life and live it in a healthy manner, in spite of what you've been told about typical lifespans in diabetics and all the ailments we seem to be bound to suffer later in life, wouldn't you do it? I would. And I hope you do too. So I recommend you take the time to read what Dr. Berstein has to say to you.	2005-06-03

I've become a fan of Frommer's guides. They are predictable in terms of quality: you know you will get a solid and up-to-date guide for your trip planning needs. It is consistent through the years, even as it improves: you know where to look for things. But best of all, it is definitely written with the traveller in mind. Things are arranged in a way that makes searching for information easy. We are planning a trip to North Carolina soon, and I sat down to get ideas and tips for it with the Frommer's guide to the Carolinas & Georgia. I am happy I took the time to check it out.

This book will be closer to the content you can expect in a basic book about Zen Buddhism or a coffee table about the topic, than what you'll want to read past your introduction into Zen. It must be noted, though, that the author's expertise (photography) stands out, and almost all the pictures includes are an outstanding companion to illustrate all the topics, making the book pretty much be worth your while. However, if you want an illustrated book on Zen that will also give you more substance, I recommend \\"Easy-To-Use Zen: Refresh and Calm Your Mind, Body and Spirit With the Wisdom of Zen\\" by David Scott.	2005-05-22

It is one of those books that you can't stop thinking of. \\"Such a smart title!\\" I kept thinking to myself. Well, the title is not the only smart thing about it. Reading through Osho's \\"Your Answers Questioned\\" I was constantly reminded of some of the thoughts that pop up in your face as you read authors such as Richard Bach or Paulo Coelho (two of my favorite writers, by the way). They are just so wise, you almost feel like an idiot for not having \\"gotten\\" some of their pearls of wisdom before! <br /> <br />So, why 4 stars only? I must say, as much as I enjoyed it (and actually continue to... it's more of a permanent reference, rather than a one-time read), there are pages where I cannot avoid but feel that the author fell short... like there's not that much depth into some of the elements he presents. But this is not an excessive issue. For the most part, the book comes in like a fascinating questioning process of some of the things we take for granted and/or we never question.	2005-03-16

So far, we've gotten our baby several of the titles in the Baby Einstein series, and they've been quite a success in our household. I'd read about their discovery cards many times, but it wasn't until recently that it finally struck me what the deal was with the cards.<br /><br />Babies love images and books. And the destiny of most books in the hands of babies is to end up broken into individual pages... which they still love \\"turning\\" and flipping to see them once and again. Baby Einstein figured this out, and created the discovery cards. This set in particular contains 29 cards with beautiful pictures of animals. In the back, they contain tips and insights about each animal, so as you give you ideas of things to tell your baby about the animal as you're going through them.<br /><br />It's a simply concept that makes perfect sense, and our son loves them, so I love them too! Plus they're VERY educational. Get your child your set of Animal Discovery Cards and you will see what I mean.	2005-03-08

In a nutshell, the author of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" tells us that no life is a waste. No matter how it ends. The only time wasted is the one thinking we are alone, as he says in the words of the Blue Man, one of the five people \\"Eddie\\" (the main character) meets as he goes through his early stages in heaven.<br /><br />I must admit I had a rough time getting over the first 30-40 pages. I just couldn't get myself to read it. But once Eddie meets the first person, you cannot avoid being engaged. Having finished the book the same day I learned about the possibility of my dad having cancer can only mean that certain things are meant to be encountered at certain moments and only then. Indeed, like Albom writes, nothing is random: everything happens for a reason.<br /><br />I only wish this book can give you the same peace it gave to me, my mom and my dad.	2005-01-08

It's got more than cool shots (a good many of them posed for) and interesting tales of the band by its four remaining members (and a host of interviews by collaborators, fans and close friends). What's missing from the book almost speaks louder than wha'ts in it. It is inevitable to stumble upon the absence of ANY quotes from the late Brian Jones, his substitute Mick Taylor or the former bass player Bill Wyman. It's the proverbial invisible elephant in the room! Let's face it: the book is more about the vibe and chemistry that kept the surviving members together through the years. Those left behind (like Wyman) have only themselves or their legends to speak for them. Because of this, I take a star off my rating, and leave it still at a good four stars, because it is still a nice document.	2004-11-07

In terms of the copy basics you need to dominate to increase conversion rates for your web site, this book is it. \\"Persuasive Online Copywriting\\" takes you gradually from copy writing techniques and general do's/don'ts (for example, focusing on benefits, not features, when writing copy) into the specifics of writing successful copy for the Web to convert visitors into buyers and have them come back.<br /><br />There is no magic trick here. At the end of the day, some of the very concepts that would apply offline are still valid online. But Eisenberg and company are very effective at packaging them in a way that comes in very handy for online copywriters. An absolute must for people specializing in copy, as well as SEO, producers and content managers at large.	2004-10-19

No. In the same way, you cannot afford to write copy without \\"The Copywriter's Handbook\\". Robert W. Bly's \\"Copywriter's Handbook\\" has become such a standard among copywriters that in its almost 20 years of existence it hasn't undergone much transformation. Yet its message is as useful and powerful today as it was back in 1985.<br /><br />Broken into three great parts, the book allows readers (or writers, for the matter) to focus on what's relevant to them. Part I touches on how to write copy that sells, dealing with headlines, tips on how to better write to sell and the preparation process for writing. Part II deals with the tasks of the Copywriter. From writing copy for print ads and direct mail, all the way to writing commercials, the only thing that is missing in it is how to address an online crowd. But books like \\"Persuasive Online Copywriting\\" take care of this full well, lifting the pressure off of this guide. Finally, part III talks in detail about the copy writing waters from a business point of view.<br /><br />Quite simply, if you are into copy writing in any function, this book is a must.	2004-09-22

By applying a very simple set of steps, Kotler accomplishes the goal, opening outstanding avenues consisting of fantastic ideas that normally don't pop up, unless they are induced, as is the case thanks to the Lateral Marketing framework.<br /><br />The only downside I found to the book was that it could have accomplished the same goal in much less space. A lot gets repeated, so by the time you're 2/3 into the book, you start to rehash some previous concepts. Otherwise, it's a pearl for anyone new or foreign to marketing, to help develop the ability of \\"thinking outside the box\\" to come up with some fantastic ideas for new brands and products.	2004-09-17

Scot Wingo, the author, is very successful in providing a strategic framework to build a solid eBay-centered business.<br /><br /> Although it is not difficult to see how the book can translate into a promotional tool for the author's services in the long run (which I don't see a problem with, either), it does not come across as a \\"salespitch\\" book. This is a very logical and thought out book with thorough and insightful examples that anyone who's selling anything on eBay could find useful. However, it is mostly meant to help people with enough items being put for sale on eBay and entrepreneurs who base their sales operations on eBay.<br /><br /> The only issue I had with the book was the sometimes excessive use of acronyms that keeps you going back to remember their meaning, but after a while, you get used to it (obviously too, after a while of applying his framework, it becomes second nature!)<br /><br /> All in all, this is one of the best books on selling over eBay I've run into in a good while. As someone who has been selling (and buying) on eBay for over three years now, I highly recommend it, mostly for eBay-centered entrepreneurs: there was almost not a single chapter in it where I could not learn something.	2004-08-07

On the contrary, it was quite funny and packed with thought-provoking comments that make you question some of your irrational behaviors as you're going through the stages of parenthood , both before and after birth. However, I expected a lot more humor from the star and producer of 'Mad About You', arguably one of the best comedy shows ever, along with 'Seinfeld'. On that level, I must recommend as an alternative (a non-stop laughter generator) the book &quot;Being a Dad: The Stuff No One Told Me&quot;. I read it shortly before &quot;Babyhood&quot;. Though not as deep as this one in some spots, I found it to be a lot funnier than Reiser's.	2004-06-30

Where Thurow's book, the best one in terms of accomplishing high rankins in 'organic' (read unpaid) search results, Seda's book brings along the whole other side of the equation: that of paid options to accomplish high rankings. In doing so, one of her key points is that Search Engine Advertising doesn't end when the customer arrives at your site (visits), but it really is about conversions (getting the customer to make a purchase, subscribe or whatever your web site's purpose is when s/he arrives to it).<br />The book is very well structured around six parts:<br />i) Planning: the key (yet sometimes overlooked) part of the process, to ensure you know who you are targetting and how, before jumping into the paid options.<br />ii) Paid Placement Programs: she presents the differences (pros and cons) of the most important fixed placement and pay-for-placement programs available.<br />iii) Paid Inclusion Programs: directories are presented here in all their splendor, along with what you can do to enhance your possibilities before submitting your site, and how to manage a large number of simultaneous submissions. Web site optimization is touched upon briefly at this point, but in no way substituting Thurow's book on the topic: you simply have to have both, if you're serious about Online Marketing at all.<br />iv) Specialized Search Engines: comparison shopping engines, vertical market search engines and international search engines are discussed in some detail, to get you started with them.<br />v) Tracking ROI: normally just as overlooked as the planning stage, the tracking of the results of paid advertising campaigns are discussed in extensive detail to ensure that you are able to steer the boat in the right direction if your ROI data shows that you're putting money on the wrong key terms, your copy is not doing what it should to engage customers, or your landing pages are not taking customers where you want them to go once they get to your site.<br />vi) Protecting profits: topics such as click fraud, trademark infringement and affilate networks are discussed, as things to keep an eye on.<br />All in all, this is not a book you'd want to sit down and read in one afternoon (nor would you be able to). This is a hands-on book to work through and use as a reference as you're getting your feet wet with this whole other animal that is paid advertising on the Web. It has done a ton for me in the two months I've been applying the concepts contained in it, since it summarizes very well all the options available to you, their pros/cons and how to best take advantage of them, considering your size and budget.

From the very first page the stories will make you laugh so hard, you will see yourself forced to explain your wife what is wrong with you! By the same token, each of the chapters is no more than 4 pages (the approximate attention span you will be able to devote to any reading the first few years after having a baby), and the topics covered in them are not farfetched, but very close to home, making it very easy for new dads to relate to them.<br />All in all, this is not a book on &quot;advice&quot; for new dads, but rather some great and fun reading that will provide you with some very much needed relief during some of those first few sleep-deprived nights the first years of your kids. Most definitely check it out, laugh out loud too and relax when you learn that you are not alone. ;)<br />Disclaimer: I was provided with a reviewing copy of the book by the publisher.	2004-05-30

While it does come accross as a bit pompous at times, indeed, the biggest issue it has is the fact that it hasn't been updated since its first edition, five years ago, an entire lifetime by Internet standards. As a result, several ubiquitous terms that you run into everywhere today are missing: blog, RSS, CSS, XHTML, flat panel, and the list goes on and on. So, as much as they ditch the more conservative AP Stylebook, it is not that much better as a tool for editors/writers working in the \\"digital age\\", so I don't see much of a point in buying it at this point any more.	2004-05-19

Telling the story of his weekly Tuesday meetings with Morrie, his old professor that was going through the pains of degenerative disease ALS, Albom evolves as a human being as Morrie approaches his final days, and he realizes how much we place importance on the wrong things in life and how much we fear leaving life altogether.<br />It is practically impossible to quote the book without leaving out something meaningful: that powerful (yet simple) is this tale, to the point of being the only book I can recall having read once again after I read it the first time. And nowadays Morrie's message is as important as it was a few years ago, when the book first came out: &quot;Be compassionate, and take responsibility for each other. If we only learned those lessons, this world would be so much better a place... Love each other or die.&quot;	2004-05-13

Packed with stories that could very well be biographical of any of our lives, showcasing some of our daily human struggles (more particularly in the case of women), and loaded with emotions, this book of short stories hooks the reader from the start and makes for a fantastic one-seat reading over the course of a couple of hours at night.<br />Among all the stories in it &quot;La Enemiga&quot; (The Enemy) strikes me as brilliant, reminding of the style of Suskind's &quot;The Perfume&quot; with its intrigue and handling of words: &quot;Se trata de una necesidad. Alguien tiene que morir para ponerle punto final a una situaci&oacute;n que me ha centrado en la desesperaci&oacute;n.&quot; (This has become a need by now. Someone has to die in order to finish a situation that has driven me to desperation.)<br />In the interest of full disclosure, I know the author on a personal level, which I consider to be an honor, given the quality of her work. I only hope she continues to publish more works after this one, which succeeded at tapping into her literary soul.	2004-05-11

Although it falls a little short, still it accomplishes a task that cannot be diminished: it shows executives (and managers at large, I'd argue) how to make meetings more effective for once, and (are you ready for this?) he advocates for more, not less, meetings, in order to enhance the performance of companies and positively impact the lives of those who work in them.<br />The book, like his previous ones, is cleverly structured in two large parts: The Fable and The Model. The first part lays out a sort of novel, where the characters could pretty much be you and me, taking part in management meetings in our own companies, and tells the story of how implementing his methodology (brought about by a &quot;consultant in disguise&quot;, impersonated by the CEO's personal assistant) helped put the company's steering team out of its meeting &quot;misery&quot;, by turning their meetings into a satisfactory and productive experience that they started looking forward to from then on.<br />The second part summarizes the methodology presented in The Fable, in a more general context, by introducing the four types of meeting he advocates:<br />-Daily Check-In<br />-Weekly Tactical<br />-Monthly Strategic (or Ad Hoc Strategic)<br />-Quarterly Off-site Review<br />Even if you think you are effective at managing your meetings, I highly recommend that you give &quot;Death By Meeting&quot; a read. It won't take more than 2 hours of your time, and it will provide you and your team with benefits to reap for life. Disregard at your own managerial risk!	2004-05-09

I was actually very entertained by the few opening pages, since Daisey sure has an odd way of 'knowing' himself and making fun of how (much of a slacker) he is and how he's gone about life so far being that way. Something else that caught me were his ficticious e-mails to Amazon's head, Jeff Bezos, which are a consistent way he has to wrap up every chapter in the book.<br />Granted that he keeps on bring in new \\"characters\\" into the story (he actually seems pretty good at disclosing when he's talking about a real person -his BizDev boss, Employee #5, for example- as opposed to when he's aggregating traits from several different characters into one, as a literary license -his peer Cody, for instance), the problem with the book is that his humorous style starts getting old after a few chapters. So, you can see how, when I was close to the middle, the book felt quite heavy. Yet I stuck with it. While I don't feel particularly fond (or sorry) that I did finish it (it is not like a lifechanging book, if you must know), I did find a couple of things of value beyond the sheer fun he insists on making of Amazon:<br />1) Regardless of what company you work for, it is not healthy to idealize them. All companies (like the people they're made up of), even the best ones have flaws, which makes any idealization of them a flawed process, destined to disilussion those who can't deal with anything but perfection from their \\"idols\\".<br />2) What goes around, comes around. The author (apparently) tried to go against what he truly was, in trying to be corporate, and it bit him back, because he was a slacker at heart, and as much as he satirized the company's behavior, his was no example to be followed. Simply put, no \\"wrong\\" deeds by an employer justify a wrong response by an employee. Still, it took him 21 dog years (3 human years) to realize he was just in the wrong place to start with: good for him that he left!<br />All in all, a book to read in little chunks or in one sitting. Not a source of overwhelming wisdom or a source of endless laughter, but a quite humourous & \\"philosophical\\" dot-com-mentary of sorts.

This is indeed the best book about the topic of RSS (RDF Site Summary), which has become increasingly more important since blogs jumped out of tech obscurity to become a mainstream form of web-enabled information dissemination. However, nowadays the topic is too dynamic (there's too much happening these days in the field of RSS) to make Hammersley's book a comprehensive and current enough resource for all matters and purposes.<br />As a general introductory reading, it's the best book out there. But once you get your feet deep enough in the RSS waters, you need to go online and search for the current APIs, Web Services, News Aggregators and RSS/Blog Directories, which is the area where the book will fall behind the fast growth of this area. Overall, very well structured, even with an appendix on the XML you need to know, in order to be able to deal with RSS.	2004-03-26

I was way into it (page 60+ or so) and still wondering what the big deal about it was. This is the reason why I give it four stars: it takes a while to hook you. But if you stick to it, Komisar has a wealth of experience to share with you, from his first days in the East Coast, litigating, all through his experiences with tech giants such as WebTV, Tivo and Apple.<br />The main idea presented by Komisar is that you don't need to postpone your life's dream for later, by playing it safe and engaging in what he calls the Deferred Life Plan. To convey this idea, he presents the reader with the process through which he takes Lenny (an entrepreneur at heart, driven by money, who comes to him for advice) in his pursuit to push his Business Plan for Funerals.com into the attention span of some Silicon Valley VC that Komisar knows. Initially a great idea conceived as a community-building scheme, leveraging the Web to assist those in grief due to the loss of a loved one, Funerals.com had evolved into a very basic money-making scheme that didn't have much of a spark to it, tied to the sale of cheaper caskets by leveraging the efficiencies that the Web can bring about.<br />In the end, if you take away the Silicon Valley specifics, Komisar's point remains not just valid, but a healthy proposition to lead life driven from within, by passion for what you do and pride rooted in leaving a legacy behind you, instead of ambition and short-term gratification. Highly recommended reading for those who are searching for their mission in life, as well as those who are considering pursuing the entrepreneurial path in their lives.	2004-03-18

You will realize that the baby starts to have a way with things: a way of crying, for example, that differs when (s)he is sick, than when (s)he wants to be held or wants to eat.<br />All in all, I've found \\"The New Father: A Dad's Guide to the First Year\\" to be insightful enough, to be of use as a reference to be read before bedtime, plus it is not the type of book you need to swallow all in one chunk, but you can read it as your baby grows, which is major when you (as a new parent) cannot honestly have too much uniterrupted time for reading (or any other activity, for the matter)! :)	2004-03-08

Due to that, it misses on some very useful pieces of information and resources the writer could have offered, if a more recent edition were available.<br />Now that I wrote about the negative (I normally don't do things in this order, but it just came to me), on to the good things:<br />-The book addresses to a sufficient extent many of the issues (time and stress-wise, in terms of ethical conflicts, etc.) that stem out of starting a consulting practice beside your full-time job. This is where the CORE STRENGTH of the book lies. I've not been able to find any other titles that go into this topic so effectively... in fact, I've not found any other books on the topic at all. Most of the other consulting books I've checked out simply deal with consulting, considering it full-time dedication deal.<br />-The author -the President of her own HR Consultancy- also volunteers some good (though far from unique or comprehensive) advice on putting together a pricing scheme for your services, finding sources of financing for your outlet, starting your office at home, marketing your services, and even heads up into critical tax/legal considerations to take into account.<br />Other than the outdated material in a few parts where references are cited, and the lack of online information to support the book, I liked her book. All in all, it is not a recipe book, but a reference and a rather good one, most specifically useful to those in the process of considering a consulting business on the side, and even for those who are already doing it, in order to assist with setting things up that you might not have thought of up to this point.<br />Note: unless she went out of business or did a poor job at marketing her services online, it's impossible to find any other reference to her in Google besides this book, whatever that implies... :\book, whatever that implies... :\	2004-02-17

Given some of the detailed comments of other reviewers, I won't go into too much detail in my review. However, it needs to be pointed out that Mr. Cohen applied his theories for negotiating to his book with quite a lot of success, to the point where you are convinced of what he's telling you. I want to clarify that I do not disagree with his strategies for negotiating: indeed, I think they work so well, it is hard to distance yourself from the book enough, to the point where you can realize that Cohen is a master at getting (most) people into buying into his ideas.<br />All in all, this is a book I highly recommend for readers of all types: the MBA type who's going through a Negotiation class, the manager who faces a tough face-to-face with someone (s)he needs to convince, the mother or the father who needs to talk the kids into something, or simply the casual reader \\"passing by\\" who feels like having a good time flying through the pages of this highly enjoyable and very useful book by one of the world's most respected negotiators. Otherwise, you can imagine how tough it can be to receive praise such as the one printed on the book's backcover, from the likes of Donald Trump, Mario Cuomo and Larry King.	2004-02-09

However, having been edited back in 1998, and being -as it is- largely focused on the documents that you, as a Small Business Owner, are likely to be in need of, it now seems a bit outdated and old-fashioned when you compare if with the ease with which you can get (for free) similar formats (business plans, marketing plans, invoices, etc.) online (in office.microsoft.com &gt; Templates, for instance).

Pete Frame, in the course of some 15 years compiled this magnificently complex printed documentary that includes the family trees and evolution of most every rock band you can think of dated before 1993 (too bad this was the last edition of this book, which now also happens to be out of print!)<br />The beauty about the book is that it ties together bands that had a relatively close evolution, such as the case of Roxy Music and King Crimson, for example, who &quot;touched&quot; each other's paths when former Crimson's bass/voice John Wetton landed on Roxy Music #5's album, alongside Phil Manzanera, Bryan Ferry and the crew (the # refers to the nomenclature Frame uses to list the different incarnations of a band).

Coelho es un autor que he tenido la fortuna de haber leido desde sus primeros libros, cuando escribia desde un mundo de sue&ntilde;os, casi &quot;new age&quot;. Pero en sus m&aacute;s recientes tres libros (este inclu&iacute;do) su estilo se ha vuelto m&aacute;s realista... sin dejar de ser so&ntilde;ador y seguirnos invitando a so&ntilde;ar, su prosa ha dejado de ser menos acerca de relatos un tanto distantes con los cuales uno puede so&ntilde;ar, pero cuesta un tanto m&aacute;s relacionarse de forma personal, para pasar a escribir de forma m&aacute;s arraigada en la realidad, usando semejanzas con nuestra cotidianidad, que hacen de sus personajes un fiel reflejo de muchas de nuestras vivencias diarias.<br />&quot;Once Minutos&quot; sigue ese mismo patr&oacute;n, ahondando en un tema (el amor) de la forma m&aacute;s cruda que pod&iacute;a hacerlo (quiz&aacute;s): a trav&eacute;s de los ojos de una prostituta. No en vano, comenta en sus primeras l&iacute;neas (casi a manera de excusa) que &eacute;ste es un libro m&aacute;s fuerte, m&aacute;s realista... &quot;Erase una prostituta llamada Mar&iacute;a...&quot; es la frase que abre el libro, para chocar al lector casi, y entrar en pocas p&aacute;ginas en el mundo de una muchacha pueblerina que se niega a quedarse estancada en el mundo en miniatura que se desarrolla en su peque&ntilde;o pueblo del interior de Brasil. Las vueltas del destino y las decepciones amorosas conducen sus pasos a la gran ciudad y en &uacute;ltima instancia a Geneve (Suiza), donde le toca enfrentar durezas insospechadas que la fortalecen (sin endurecerla demasiado) a lo largo de un a&ntilde;o que se da a s&iacute; misma para vivir lo que la vida le ha puesto delante.<br />La novela, como los libros de Coelho en general, lo deja a uno sediento de m&aacute;s Coelho cuando llega a su fin, y la producci&oacute;n del autor en s&iacute; parece ser como los buenos vinos: conforme pasa el tiempo, mejoran. Si bien no es el m&aacute;s apto para ni&ntilde;os, sin duda colocar&iacute;a a &quot;Once Minutos&quot; junto a &quot;Ver&oacute;nica Decide Morir&quot; entre sus dos mejores libros.	2003-11-26

With a fascination for detail and a narrative that walks the reader through the very same streets where the characters delve, Kyt takes you in a journey that -unlike most other fiction stories of the genre- doesn't take place in some ficticious world that never occurred or in a faraway land, but in the very same neighborhood where the characters inhabit, in a town where you very well could live and a school where you easily could have attended as a kid.<br />Not being a huge fan of fiction myself, save for some of Tolkien's books, I was gladly surprised by Kyt's innovative approach, one that made the story engaging and believable in spite of clearly being a fiction story, making it equally appealing for grownups or kids. In the end, when you flip over the last page, you have that same refreshing feeling you hopefully felt when you viewed (or read) &quot;Never Ending Story&quot; as a kid. I will look forward to future titles by Kyt, as the story of Alden progresses and he faces new enemies and cases as a Knight Investigator.	2003-11-18

In the end, the common sense prevails (or so I'd like to believe!) and the average rating hovers somewhere around 3-4 stars.<br />What is his latest book about? I don't think it's fair to say that it picks up right where &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; left, simply because much has happened since: September 11, and the War in Irak, to begin with; his movie &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot;; and more recently, his famous acceptance speech at the Oscars, that gained him a range of reactions from boos to praise.<br />I don't personally concur with all that Moore has to say. In fact, I am in frontal disagreement with some of his views, but I have to acknowledge that he's learned some lessons since his last book, which (as some of you might know, from the review I wrote about it) I did not enjoy, because of his criticism without enough support throughout it. This time around, he's done one HUGE thing to help himself: he's provided sources (not just in the form of a footnote in the pages where quotes are included, but also in the form of an extensive 'Notes and Sources' chapter, which provides 25 pages-worth of detailed references as to where he gets the information he presents). As much as you can argue that his sources are wrong, it's not like he's getting undercover tips from an &quot;insider source&quot;. He's taking information widely available and turning it around in what I consider to be an out-of-the-box approach, looking at them from a different angle: as an example, take the chapter that deals with stats and poll results touching on a wide range of issues that conservatives criticize and liberals tend to support.<br />In the end, if you don't loose your head over his arguments (which continue to be packed with sarcasm and occasional insults, something that I don't support -if he criticizes the angry attitude of some right wing spokespeople, using the same type of angry talk puts him in the same position he's criticizing, in my opinion), there's a some things to be learned from his book. I wouldn't call it an eye-opener (I mean... if you believe EVERYTHING you're told by politicians or the media, you'd better question yourself a bit, because you're bound for dissapointment more than once!), but the book does raise some very interesting points once more, with regards to the reasons underlying the US' current war on Terror and its presence in Irak. At the very least, my recommendation is to get this book, read it and explore it: don't take it literally, but don't discard it altogether.to support.<br />In the end, if you don't loose your head over his arguments (which continue to be packed with sarcasm and occasional insults, something that I don't support -if he criticizes the angry attitude of some right wing spokespeople, using the same type of angry talk puts him in the same position he's criticizing, in my opinion), there's a some things to be learned from his book.

This is NOT a book about children's issues when growing up or what to do if they run a fever (you need to get your copy of the APA's book &quot;Caring for Your Baby and Young Child: Birth to Age 5&quot; for that purpose!). It is a book that covers the different aspects of child development (movement, senses, language, etc.) by time periods, so that you can understand what you child can or cannot do at a point in his/her life, as well as what you -as a caring parent- can do to help stimulate the child with games and activities. Complementing the excellent and well laid out content, the book is packed with lots of color photos (not illustrations) and comes with a very solid binding -in spite of being a paperback edition- which is important considering that it wil have to last you at least five years.<br />After having searched for a while, we settled on this book, along with Edward De Bono's &quot;Teach Your Child How to Think&quot;, to help with the physical and intellectual growth of our little one.	2003-10-26

By dedicating 90% of his book to a so-called leadership fable, Patrick Lencioni very effectively conveys the very essence of the model he proposes in order to deal with dysfunctional teams. Though the story he presents is that of a hypothetical newly appointed CEO of a distressed start-up and (in the beginning of the story) her highly dysfunctional executive team, the model is perfectly applicable to any team throughout most organizations.<br />The model consists of a pyramid with the five dysfunctions of a team (from the bottom, up):<br />1) Absence of trust: stemming from an unwillingness in the team members to be vulnerable and genuinely open up with one another about their mistakes and weaknesses.<br />2) Fear of conflict: inability to engage in unfiltered, passionate (yet constructive, though it may strike you as odd) debate.<br />3) Lack of commitment: no buy in and commitment can be expected when ideas and opinions have not been aired and genuinely taken into consideration prior to a decision.<br />4) Avoidance of accountability: without commitment to a clearly defined set of goals, team members will hesitate to call their colleagues on their actions and behaviors that are counterproductive for the team.<br />5) Inattention to results: Lencioni brings it all home through the realization that avoidance of accountability leads to a state where team members tend to put their individual needs above the team's collective goals.<br />Throughout the last leg of his book, Lencioni contrasts how dysfunctional teams behave by comparing them to a cohesive team in the case of each of the five dysfunctions. He also provides suggestions on overcoming each of the dysfunctions and insights into the role of the leader in this process, all in a very structured and to-the-point way. Complementing this, he provides a Team Assessment tool to help determine where your team is at in terms of each of the five elements of the model.<br />As much as the book can be digested without too much trouble in 2-3 straight hours, it is inevitable (unless you are fooling yourself or you operate in a very healthy team) to have your managerial wheels in your mind turning at full speed by the time you are done with it. As a manager and an avid reader, I welcomed this book with open arms because I found it to be very useful and readily applicable. Now comes my challenge in putting it to use.uble in 2-3 straight hours, it is inevitable (unless you are fooling yourself or you operate in a very healthy team) to have your managerial wheels in your mind turning at full speed by the time you are done with it.

He provides a very robust framework that you can follow in your project, if you have the time to read through its almost 1000 pages.<br />First, he delves into a very thorough discussion about the more 'phylosophical' topics of content (what it is, what is data, what is metadata, etc.) and content management at large. If you haven't gotten your feet wet with a CMS project before, the first 10 chapters (175 pages) will get you soaked with the type of dilemmas you are bound to face when you work on a CMS.<br />Then, he provides what could be considered a &quot;recipe&quot; to put together a CMS successfully (though no two CMS projects are ever alike, but a lot of them have similar characteristics). There are a number of chapters and sections specifically devoted to the steps required to ensure a successful outsourcing of the project, but the framework he provides is not limited to it: you can perfectly apply it to an in-house implementation. Also, he tends to paint the largest possible picture (with all staff possible, etc.) but you can very easily scale it down to the size and shape of your organization.<br />In general, his framework goes back once and again to the concept of the &quot;Wheel of Content Management&quot; where he connects the spikes that allow the 'wheel' to move: goals and requirements, audiences, publications, authors, acquisition sources, workflow and staff and access structures, all revolving around the central content component classes with metadata as the outside of the wheel, serving as a container for it all.<br />He doesn't wrap up the book without devoting enough space to XML and its close cousin, the DTD. He even provides a small VB app to convert Word content to XML, and that's still &quot;only&quot; on page 788. If you haven't noticed by now, this book is MASSIVE, and if there's any issue with it, that would be it: the fact that you will need to devote a long time to processing it. But all in all, the book with its companion web site is an invaluable tool for all Project Managers who have in their hands the responsibility of giving birth to a CMS for their organizations.t;only&quot; on page 788.

But when you delve into his life, you realize that his was one that was filled with demons: living on the edge, pimping for money to finance his heroin addiction, struggling to get by at times, to come back victorious at others, with his 'act' cleaned up to put together a group of brilliant musicians and turn jazz on its head once more.<br />I picked up &quot;Miles&quot; a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't been able to put it down. The style of the book is raw, but direct: granted you can't go past a few paragraphs without reading him curse his way through a memory of an episode of his life, but this is his personal account, without a filter, without political correctness, which is good, because that is certainly one thing Miles was not: politically correct.<br />Complementing in a very balanced way facts about his life with their ups and downs, with very vivid and detailed descriptions about gigs and sessions all through his life, and never skipping the &quot;ugly&quot; parts of the story, this book has given me a deeper respect for a man that could overcome his demons to come out victorious and more creative time and again.	2003-10-05

What this book is tailored for is the audience of photographers, artists, designers and writers who want to \\"go\\" one more step beyond just putting together the content elements for their works.<br />The book is assembled around five building blocks:<br />-Establishing a Layout Style: designing and typesetting the book.<br />-Assembling the document digitally: goes into some detail about the most popular page layout program out there, QuarkXpress. Although it covers the most importants elements of version 4 (version 6 is out as of this writing), most of the \\"tips\\" provided will still be useful. If you need a 'bible' on the topic, you will need to pick up the \\"QuarkXpress Bible\\".<br />-Preparing images for reproduction: the art of scanning and retouching images.<br />-Printing the document: considerations about color space, printing from different applications (Quark, Acrobat), effect on different types of paper, printing to InkJet printers and so on.<br />-Binding the book: depending on the binding resources at hand, this section might offer a lot more information than you will ever need to know about the topic.<br />Finally, there is a short section devoted to the very debated topic of copyright and the law. In general, I found the book to be very useful and beautifully illustrated, but it still is a primer.

As an expecting dad (our baby should be with us within the next few weeks) I have been trying to learn as much as I can and shared readings with my wife on all things about the baby, but the truth is that, as men, we need some literature that will relate a bit more to us, and give us &quot;tips&quot; on how to better cope with this whole thing that's going on around us, for which most likely we've never been prepared. This is where this book comes in handy! From the same authors of the reputed book &quot;Your Pregnancy Week by Week&quot; (now in its fourth edition), came this one, meant to help expectant fathers &quot;understand what a woman goes through during pregnancy and how [they] can help her deal with the things that are happening to her.&quot;<br />Opening up is a very useful table that breaks down topics (with page #s) into &quot;The Good Part,&quot; &quot;You May Want to Help Your Partner Deal With&quot; and &quot;Pay Attention to&quot; by trimester, around labor and delivery, and finally at home with the baby (in a &quot;What to expect when you're expecting&quot; fashion, if you may). Also VERY useful are the abundance of DOs (Brownie Points) and DON'Ts (In The Doghouse) spread throughout the book, nicely going hand in hand with the topics covered in the pages where they pop up.<br />There is also a sort of glossary of terms for expecting couples, and then the book goes into topics that deal with the emotional, physical and financial aspects of pregnancy in enough detail to serve as a very good primer for most matters and purposes. Definitely not meant as an in-depth book on pregnancy, childbirth or raising your newborn child, this book does fulfill a purpose by providing expecting dads with an easy-to-read book that they can relate to, in order to get them up to speed with the basics about pregnancy, and -most importantly- to ensure that they are able to cope with their wives' needs as best as possible during pregnancy and thereafter.	2003-09-07

Books	2	8	20	N	N	Too much -non constructive- criticism	After having read the first few pages, I thought that Moore stood against Republicans. Then, it seemed that he stood against Democrats that are a bit conservative as well. Later on, it became obvious -despite being white himself- that the title of the book reveled his oposition to white America and how it keeps black people oppressed. But then he showed words of \\"advice\\" toward black people that felt like a mock toward them, more than a joke. He criticizes Republicans for their disdain toward conservation and the environment and then jumps on recycling as being pointless because it \\"never\\" actually occurs (apparently he once saw a recycling truck dump an entire load of recyclables in the dumpster)... Get the point?<br />The whole book (well, maybe I should admit that I couldn't get through more than half of it -I don't have much of a stomach this type of book-) is about what he is against of, what he opposes, and he sure is against a lot of things! What doesn't seem clear is what he stands for. Hiding behind a language packed with sarcasm and \\"humor\\", and basing his points on personal experiences (or inventions, I'm almost inclined to assume), rather than quotable evidence (I couldn't find a single reliable source for any of his points in the book's pages), he delivers a message that seeks to undermine most of America's institutions, and while I can't blindly believe that all the groups and institutions he criticizes are transparent and clean, I find it hard to believe that... simply there's nothing worth believing in in \\"Stupid White America\\", which pretty much is what the bottom line of his book is. Why, you might wonder? Because I come from a country where, unfortunately, things are REALLY screwed up! So I learned to appreciate and respect the level of organization that institutions in the US have, in spite of all the criticism that they might deserve.<br />Do you think that the Postal service in the US is bad?

But if you stick to the title, it will reward its readers (mostly managers, I'd hope). It deals in very clear and easy-to-follow words (even for those of you that have been out of school for many, many years) with what is Six Sigma, what it entails (in terms of cost, benefits, cultural mindset change), how to implement and sustain, etc. It even devotes an entire section to an overview of the statistical tools required to get your arms around Six Sigma for the first time.<br />Again, I'd not use it as a reference for in depth matters, but as a primer on the topic, I think it does an excellent job.	2003-08-19

Therefore his authority in terms of improving process functions is undisputable.<br />Now, as far as this book goes, after you have gone past the first half it begins to turn repetitive (maybe it's a poor translation, or maybe poor editing, but it hurts the book) and you begin finding some concepts that popped up earlier in the book. Still, I was able to gather some very useful ideas... That's how this book is: if you stick to it, past the repetition, even in the numerous examples Mr. Shingo provides, you will find a wealth of ideas to improve your enterprise's processes.

I have had the privilege of being one of Dr. Dolinar's patients in Phoenix, while I lived there. I say privilege because he's definitely one physician that, unlike many others, takes the time during each visit, to talk with you and calm you down about any doubts or fears you might have. With this book, you can almost have the same opportunity. He put together a very comprehensive and solid text with the help of Betty Page Brackenridge, and this one differs from most of the other diabetes books you will run into in one main respect: it doesn't &quot;cover the topic&quot; in a theoretical, distant manner. It goes all the way through the basics and the more sophisticated topics dealing with insulin-dependence by means of a story, the story of Mike (a longtime diabetic who uses insuline) and his conversations and interactions with his doctor and diabetes educator. It makes it very easy for you as a diabetic to relate to the story, simply because you have been there, and &quot;done that&quot; before.<br />As for the topics covered, the book deals with Dynamic Insulin Dosing (one very important tool once you are on fast-acting insulin), and a detailed insight about the condition of diabetes borrowing from the metaphor of a fireplace in a cabin, and comparing its many elements to those of a human body: cabin=body cell, logs=blood sugar, keeping a steady flow of air=insulin, etc. Also there's extensive discussing about monitoring (things that you will want to learn about it) and hypoglycemia, and how to prevent it, identify it and treat it.<br />The part that I found most useful is where the book deals with &quot;living&quot; with diabetes: what do you do on sick days; how to manage grocery shopping and eating outside; what to do and not to do when travelling with diabetes; how to cope with/handle stress; what to expect with regards to insurance claims and much more. In short, the daily in-and-outs of a diabetic, all stuff that you will easily relate with and will have a great time reading and learning from it.

I have the previous edition of this book, and it was the only reference (beside some tips from friends on things to do) that we used to find our way around and find cool things to check out while in San Francisco last December. The photos (yes, there's a lot of them) were actually pretty useful, I thought, since they served as a very good guide for what to look for when we hit a particular neighborhood, in terms of landmarks. We found the guide also to be right on in terms of restaurant references and pricing information, and if you want to stretch your trip to San Fran a bit, it also provides useful info for excursions into Napa Valley and the like. All in all, a nice little guide I totally recommend: not your street-by-street atlas, that's granted, but very useful nevertheless.	2003-07-03

It's very intuitively structured: Masculine Names and Feminine Names, ordered alphabetically, with the meaning or origin of the name, variant forms and contemporary examples where they apply. Although the book is been around far longer than most competitors, it has what it takes to be useful: not too fancy, not too cool, not wanting to have tens of thousands of names. Just plain concise, useful and focused on quality over quantity.	2003-06-02

This is mostly a heads-up for expecting husbands: get this book for your wives, but (if you can) have your wives take its advice and comments with a grain of salt. If you don't, your wives will find reinforcement for things that will not necessarily make them happy, like make them \\"realize\\" that they actually look fat and not cute while they're pregnant. I like the way my wife looks during her pregnancy, so I don't appreciate (even if it's meant as a joke) that the book gives her reasons to think otherwise. If you can deal with things like this, then get yourself a copy. Otherwise, be warned. :)	2003-05-26

It is hard to talk about Chavez without emotion, without passion for me. I left Venezuela over three years ago because I decided I didn't want my family to be raised in what was to come (and I don't regret having left), so I will not deny that I am an open anti-chavista. Now, on to this author and his views...<br />First of all, the period covered in the book (before 2000) could be a  pretext for the author's views, since (like he did in his book), many intellectuals, leftwing and not-so-leftwing too, were supportive of the Lieutenant Colonel back until 2001 even: after all and although I did not like him from the start, Chavez could have been a true alternative to decades of corruption and traditional politics in Venezuela. Also many, many middle-class, educated people (to my dismay, some still to this day) supported him. I emphasize the word \\"educated\\", because it is no surprise that his demagogical approach results appealing to the lower-income strata of Venezuela, much like it was the case with previous Presidents.<br />On a side note, I saw the reaction that a figure like Castro provoked in the media in Venezuela (in case you're wondering, I am from Venezuela) during the visit for the ceremony where Carlos Andres Perez took on the presidency for the second time: they were running around Castro like puppies, fascinated my the \\"comandante\\". Therefore, it doesn't surprise me that Gott acknowledges that \\"reporters have always been susceptible to the charms of Latin America's radical strongmen, and I am no exception\\".<br />What's my point here? Gott's views cannot be excused as being accidentally biased in this book, simply because Chavez had not taken his mask off by the time he wrote his book, allowing the unaccounted deaths of dozens of his opposers, the looting of the country's main industry (PDVSA, the Venezuelan oil company), and the gradual shut-down of the economy leading to shortages in basic foods and medicines. Gott's views (is it coincidence that his last name means \\"God\\" in German?) had not changed much by early 2003....<br />This book is just another leftist manifesto, supportive of the barbaric attrocities of a regime who is perfectly willing to say with a straight face that the country cannot be in better shape and blame the opposition for everything, while inflation, unemployment and several other macroeconomic indicators are at their worse levels in over a century, in spite of the fact that the country has over $16 billion in international reserves. Sadly, I can't say that I entirely support the work of the opposition either, one that has come out of the struggle against Chavez as a fragmented block, and one that doesn't show enough signs of acknowledgement that politics-as-we-know-it will no longer work in Venezuela after this past few years of political and social nightmare.<br />Knowledge of a country or expertise about a region doesn't give the author's opinion any more credibility than the opinion of any of the government's spokespersons.t name means \\"God\\" in German?) had not changed much by early 2003....<br />This book is just another leftist manifesto, supportive of the barbaric attrocities of a regime who is perfectly willing to say with a straight face that the country cannot be in better shape and blame the opposition for everything, while inflation, unemployment and several other macroeconomic indicators are at their worse levels in over a century, in spite of the fact that the country has over $16 billion in international reserves.

Books	3	0	0	N	N	How to get out of the rat race	Over a year after having read it for the first time, I decided to take a second hard look at the book. Some of the concepts that Robert T. Kiyosaki presents in his book have resounded in my head once again. His teachings have helped, I should say: not letting emotions such as fear rule over financial decisions (though it's easier said than done), postponing immediate gratification, and responding with a proactive mind (and a proactive language) in the face of financial adversity.<br />Today, the friend of mine who first recommended Kiyosaki's book to me in on his way out of the rat race, and I find myself in a different place than I was a year ago: I've learned some lessons and I am dying to put others into practice (which I firmly intend to do in the next twelve months).<br />The lessons that impacted me the most:<br />The Rich Don't Work For Money, they have money work for them by creating enough wealth within their assets (and he doesn't count the home they're living in as one, so you can count that one out) to pay for their monthly living expenses, so that they don't need to depend on a job for that, which is the case of most of us. The kind of assets he talks about are businesses that do not require your physical presence: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-generating real estate, etc.<br />The book also goes to some extent into some of the advantages of incorporating your own corporation, but it is by no means an exhaustive guide on the topic; it goes into why you should work to learn, not for money. To have each job as a learning ground on which you can build skills which you can later use for yourself as you run your own corporation or company. Does this sound a little selfish? It might be, and that's another paradigm which the book attempts to break: to mind your own business, meaning to do what you have to, but not to loose sight of your financial goal. The author's point is to make the best of each work experience and learn as much as possible from each. Learn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it needs more editing. At times the author suddenly jumps between thoughts from one paragraph to the next. Ironically enough he admits in the book that he's not one hell of a writer (and he's right about that), but the editor could have done a better job. The other thing is the level of the book. When you're done with it, hopefully (as it did for me) it leaves you thinking, which is a good thing, but it also leaves you with a bunch of questions. Most likely, after having read several of his other books, this was a business-driven decision: not give out the entire 'enchilada' to you in one book, so some of the answers can be found in other books of his, or written by other authors of the 'Rich Dad' series. Other than these two things, the book is interesting, quick to read (doesn't take anything else beyond an open mind) and (if you let it) lifechanging.earn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it needs more editing.

It included the name, current language (where it comes from), ethnicity, meaning, biblical citation (if any), popularity, nicknames, alternative spellings and more. In the end, it doesn't offer 20 or 30 thousand names like most titles, but &quot;only&quot; 15 thousand.

The book is packed with tips on how to obtain publicity the guerrilla way, sometimes at a minimal expense to your business, although Levinson does acknowledge the importance of devoting &quot;a good chunk&quot; of your marketing expense to this critical component. At times it could use more examples: it feels like a five-minute guide to all publicity topics (in fact, you WILL be able to complete the whole book in less than a weekend).

Since my wife and I found out we were expecting, we've been avid readers of our copy of &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting&quot;. True that an important part of the content is devoted to the fears and &quot;things that could go wrong&quot; but the fact is that when you don't have information it is fear about the unknown precisely. I find the way the book is presented, in a kind of Question and Answer way, to be very easy to follow. If you zoom out a bit more, you find a predictable structure to every chapter each of which corresponds to a month of the pregnancy, so you can't get lost here. If you want more of an issue, there's normally at least two answers dealt with. If you only have limited time to read something, it's put together in such a way that you can skim through it without missing out on a lot.<br />All in all, it takes you by the hand as you learn more about the mother's body and the changes she's undergoing, the baby's growth and what to expect when, as well as what the fathers feel and fear during these forty beautiful weeks. Get it and join the &quot;secret&quot; club of the pregnant couples who already have it: at least I felt that way when I got it.

It's been over a year now since I first read and reviewed this book, co-authored by the world's guru on Web Usability, Jakob Nielsen and Marie Tahir. Still it provides incredible advice on what to do and what not to do on a Homepage. As much criticism as the author's seem to throw at web sites, if you read it, think Jay Leno and have fun! Don't take it personally and THINK whether you might be making the same mistakes on your own web site. For instance, a number of the sites featured in the book are still (even after subsequent redesigns) incurring in the same mistakes, some of them not even related to Web Design, but rather to Marketing at large. In fact, one of the most common ones continues to be the lack of an effective tag line that explains clearly what the site/company is about. After over a year, it's surprising how useful this book can continue to be, in spite of the very dynamic nature of the Web.<br />As a Web Project Manager, this book is a continuous reference for ideas and pitfall watchouts.

It boils down to not having fear or letting fear and emotions control our reactions. Always STOP, CHALLENGE and CHOOSE in the face of crisis. Stop to think. Challenge your moment's thoughts and reactions. Choose the optimal course of action. The definition of the author for winning is lovely indeed: to do the best that one can with all that one has.<br />Now, in terms of implementation, there is a lot of space devoted to the what, but barely one chapter devoted to the how to put the book's ideas in practice, although it's fair to say that there's a good number of examples and cases brought forward. The second to last chapter is dedicated to putting together a Statement of Purpose, followed by a Vision and a plan to set it all in motion, but I can't help remembering the level of detail that Stephen Covey goes into in his book \\"The 7 Habits...\\" when discussing this same topic, and this is one that he covers early on in his book, devoting the rest of it to ways to make it happen.<br />All in all, it feels like a useful Step 1 book, whose key message (STOP, CHALLENGE and CHOOSE) is helpful to have present at all times, but not a book that will help make a huge step in changing your life for the long term: it falls short in some aspects, which is why I recommend Stephen Covey's work more.	2003-04-06

You can perfectly skip the epilogue (which is basically the most religion-loaded section), and still the book is perfectly useful, so don't let that comment have you turn the book down. It is worth every minute you invest on it, to help you realize how our methods of searching for a job tend to be in direct conflict with the way employers (like to) hire. Also it gives prime advice (23 ideas) on how to find that job you want, all the time with a great sense of humor, and plenty of references and links for you to go out there and expand your job-hunting knowledge base.

When I bought it I was -so to speak- going under the ups and downs of the first few weeks after being diagnosed with Type 2, and upon reading comments and reviews I decided this book could help me through some of it.Well, it did in a sense, but after the first few chapters, it becomes incredibly repetitive and, at times, even contradictory. The problem is that it's all made of essays, all of which are written by different people. This results in a true mix that more than once brings back concepts that already have been discussed, more precisely perhaps, the anger that a diabetic experiences and how to deal with it. By the fourth time I read about this, I was almost angry to find the topic discussed again! :) (not so much, but you get the point). Otherwise, it has some great advice. I would say it's best for someone who's on his or her first few days after diagnosis or someone who -regardless- continues to be on an emotional rollercoaster due to diabetes, or for parents of diabetic children. Not really the best resource for spouses of diabetics.	2003-01-26

The G.I. measures how fast the carbs in a food get translated into glucose (which travels in the blood). As most diabetics should know (I am one of them -Type 2, since October 2002), violent blood sugar rises is something that most people (athletes excepted, ocassionally, perhaps) should avoid. This is where this book's meat and bone truly lies: the presentation of this concept plus very useful tables (a ton of pages of them!) of G.I.'s of most foods, which should come in handy when choosing what to pick in the grocery store or the restaurant.<br />On the flip side, there are some VERY conflicting views presented in the book: \\"the most important message is that the diet should be low in fat and high in carbohydrates.\\" (quote from page 55). This thought disturbed me, after a year of successfully applying a low-carb lifestyle. With the new edition the above approach was not changed, but rather a new concept was introduced: that of the Glycemic Load. Think of it as a sort of weighted average that combines the quantitative (amount) component of carbs with the measure of the glycemic index (more on the qualitative end), yielding a net measure that should be a better indicator of how healthy a particular food is for you. It's too soon to say whether this Glycemic Load concept has any positive effects at all, but it makes perfect sense. To err on the safe side, I will give the book 4 stars: improved if you compare it with the original edition, but too soon to know whether it will work or not.	2003-01-17

I've been subscribed to the Daily Dilbert for quite a while now, and when I get that strip in my Inbox every morning, it's just a way to relax and laugh at some of the sad realities of work life... and other times, just a sheer innocent laugh, courtesy of Scott Adams' genius. In any case, for a fan of Dilbert, this is an ideal buy, since -after all- you need a desk calendar regardless: why not make your calendar feature your favorite comic strip! This year's (2003) calendar features strips from 1999 and 2000, so it won't be an overlap with your Daily Dilbert, and even if you've read them before, you should get a kick out of those jokes you laughed hard at when you were at that job back four years ago. Enjoy and make 2003 the best year in a long time!	2002-12-27

The G.I. measures how fast the carbs in a food get translated into glucose (which travels in the blood). As most diabetics should know (I am one of them -Type 2, since October 2002), violent blood sugar rises is something that most people (athletes excepted, ocassionally, perhaps) should avoid. This is where this book's meat and bone truly lies: the presentation of this concept plus very useful tables of G.I.'s of some 300+ foods, which should come in handy when choosing what to pick in the grocery store or the restaurant.<br />On the flip side, there are some VERY conflicting views presented in the book: &quot;the most important message is that the diet should be low in fat and high in carbohydrates.&quot; (quote from page 55). This thought disturbed me, after a year of successfully applying a low-carb lifestyle. I am eager to see what the updated edition of this book brings in 2003. All in all, useful as I said, but conflicting. I give it 3.5 stars.	2002-11-28

I got on this diet as a result of my personal doctor telling me it was the only thing that would help me from not becoming a diabetic. Although I ended up being diagnosed diabetic I have lost and maintained, over the course of 12 months now, over 30 pounds. I began as a size 38 (almost 40) and now I am on my way to size 32 (I am at a comfortable 34 at this point).<br />With the number of options you run into while grocery shopping or while dining out (at least these days, there are plenty of alternatives for people who want to live a low-carb lifestyle) an update to Dr. Atkins' theories was already due, and here it is for you. However, there are still several things you should bear in mind about it:<br />* This is NOT an easy fix for nutritional disorders. It works, but it takes TIME.<br />* This is NOT a balanced diet, because by repressing carbs (or maintaining them under 20 g per day in the begginning) it's aimed at getting your body in a state called ketosis. In such a state the body starts to use its stored fat as a source of energy, as opposed to expecting it from carbs. There are very diverse points of view about ketosis: being such a delicate topic, I invite you to make your own mind about it, but based on all I've read about it (and believe me: in a year's time, my diet is something I've devoted a lot of reading to), it seems to not be tied to the heart or kidney-related problems that are attibuted to it.<br />* It's not a static diet either, because your menu evolves as your weight does: as you begin to get to your ideal weight, the amount of carbs you're allowed increases as well.<br />* This diet requires vitamin supplements and exercise along with it, in order to work well.<br />* Most important of ALL, please check with your doctor before you begin this diet.<br />Long story short, read Atkins' books and decice for yourself. So far, I'm with it, but not too fond of the total lack of fruits that it has during its early stages. I've combined its elements with those of the \\"Omega Diet,\\" and the concept of reducing the portions I eat in every meal.e of the \\"Omega Diet,\\" and the concept of reducing the portions I eat in every meal.	2002-11-22

I am one of those weird persons who had barely heard about Southwest before reading this book: all I'd heard about them were good things, yet I had neither flown them nor read much about them. My Organizational Behavior class turned out to be the place to learn about them, and I have to say the book helped me see how a company with values that are strongly tied to having fun at work, having respect for its employees, and so many more things that demonstrate human nature at its very best, can thrive even in the face of the hardest times, when most of the major carriers are undergoing severe restructuring (bankruptcy) or layoffs.<br />In today's economy, where the airline industry has been one of the most impacted after 9/11, Southwest now has a market capitalization larger than that of all the major carriers put together and, as of today, continues to be profitable, as it has been since 1973. Quite a feat, I think you'll agree, and how they do it is something you can learn by reading this very nice book. Just make sure you grab a bag of peanuts to go with it! ;)	2002-10-21

Books	5	72	75	N	N	This book has it all: how to print, how to market and sell	I recently had the opportunity of attending one of the seminars taught at U.S. Screen Printing Institute, in Tempe, AZ, the company whose founder (Scott) wrote this book. It was there that I got my hands on this book. The book totally takes you through the ins and outs of printing T-Shirts, whether you want to do it (as the title says) for fun or as a serious business. It not only discusses the technical part in enough detail: it also goes into the marketing and sales of your product. Scott has shared in this book (and all the products he offers) his knowledge and experience of over 25 years in this industry, so that all who are considering taking it seriously as a business don't fall in the same pitfalls he went through. So: don't waste your time and money. Get yourself a copy of this great book. It's worth every penny you will pay for it and more!	2002-10-18

We are currently using the book at our Organizational Behavior class, and it's proved to be an excellent reference. The way it is structured (for the reader) makes in-depth reading or skimming through it (let's face it: this is the reality for most working MBA students!) equally effective. It has clearly distinguishable definitions on the margins, which can serve as a cue for the topic, along with the summaries at the end of every chapter. The intro and closing &quot;cases&quot; provided around the topic of the chapter are VERY insightful and on every other page or so, there are examples about the matter being discussed, which help with the understanding (I know that I, as an Engineer, appreciate examples to illustrate a point). Finally, the illustrations (graphs and charts) are one of the best things the book has! Remember that phrase that used to say &quot;a picture is worth a thousand words&quot;? Well, the authors epithomize it. The charts in the book do a great job at conveying entire pages of information at a time in a very efficient way. All in all, I like the book a lot, and it's been very helpful in complementing our in-class discussions about cases and topics of Organizational Behavior.	2002-09-27

It has to be noted that its focus is heavily on design, but always tying things to dealing with the client, timelines, cost, etc. I thought the title didn't do the book much of a favor: in fact, if you're expecting to find content focused exclusively on re-designing your Web site, you're probably bound for dissapointment, since there's only one chapter (the first one) that touches on this topic that has turned into a very commonplace nightmare situation for Web people to be caught in these days.<br />However the book IS packed with a wealth of content about WEB DESIGN at large, following what the authors call the &quot;Core Process&quot; which consists of 5 phases, all the way from defining the project to launching it an beyond. Two things that I found the book incredible about were: the space devoted to the first two phases of their methodology (planning and developing site structure) clearly overwhelms the rest of the book, which we all (should) know to be in line with the way things should be done -&quot;measure twice, cut once.&quot; Also I loved the fact that the book is packed with illustrations in full color, as opposed to other publications out there, which limit those to &quot;centerfolds&quot; or B&amp;W graphics. So, like I told you some time ago to go get the book on &quot;Web Project Management&quot; by Ashley Friedlein (published in 2000), I now advise you to get a copy of this book. As a Web designer, Webmaster or Web Project Manager, you will thank me for it.	2002-09-01

The author unfortunately touched on a number of Web sites and tactics that nowadays are either dead (Web sites) or considered bad internet marketing practices (redirecting, use of link farms) that could actually get you delisted. The section on traffic analysis at least talks about a professional tool (WebTrends) but then goes down a long and unnecessarily technical talk about web logs that is sure to bore the heck out of non-technical readers. If you don't mind getting spammed big time, by registering for some of the services the author recommends that are still around, and don't mind dropping in the ranks of Google at all, then get this book and follow its advice. Otherswise, download (and pay) for a license of WebPosition Gold and read the book that Amazon sells about it.	2002-08-10

Much of the first third of it is devoted to explanation of the software, its installation and setup, which you can read IN the software itself. Also other chapters of the book are devoted to components of WebPosition Gold which I personally find to be pretty useless: Page Generator, Upload Manager, Traffic Analysis, considering that this tool is far from bein ideal for accomplishing these three tasks. Finally, the topic of Link Popularity seemed to be thrown in last minute, given its importance nowadays that Search Engine Optimization is progressively harder to accomplish.<br />Now, when the book deals with the Reporter, Page Critic and Submitting tools that WebPosition Gold is a great software for, is when it gets really useful. It goes beyond the basics and deals with the tips and pitfalls of the different features offered by the software, warning against apparently good ideas which could get your web site banned from certain Search Engines, etc. All in all, I appreciated the advice contained in the book, but had to resort to other sources to complement the knowledge about Internet Marketing that I was seeking.	2002-07-22

I won't add to the discussion about the Seven Languages for Transformation, since my fellow reviewers have already gone into extensive detail about them. The key concept that the book left me was the idea of diving into conflicts to have them &quot;solve&quot; you, as opposed to running away from them or trying to solve them. The basis for this idea has to do with the learning opportunities that a conflict has to offer, and the opportunities of self-discovery to dig out blatant inconsistencies between what we say we care about and what our language and actions actually shows.<br />Overall, the book is a very easy read, whether you do it in order to seriously implement its suggested methodology (and it is one serious set of ideas it carries) or just as a mirror to help you laugh at your so-called professional commitments.	2002-06-22

This book attempts to demonstrate by means of a 9-step process, how you are now making a \\"dying\\" as opposed to making a living, and how you can get back on track, and start directing your actions toward a life of fulfillment and financial independence. The 9 steps look like this:<br />* STEP 1: Look back on your life and add up all the money you have made, and how much do you have with you (in the form of assets of some type) to account for it.<br />* STEP 2: Since money is something we choose to trade our life energy for (central idea of the book), determine how much money you truly get for doing your job, including the fact that you have to spend money in commuting, clothing, meals at work, etc. and start to keep track of every penny that you earn and spend. Just to illustrate the power of this step, I found myself making 25% (hourly rate) less than I thought I was by doing this exercise, and that takes into account the fact that I live 20 minutes away from my work and I half the time I bring my food from home.<br />* STEP 3: Tabulate all your expenses into categories, add them up and convert them into hours of life energy.<br />* STEP 4: Determine to what extent all the expenses you found in your categorization provide you with fulfillment, how they are in alignment with your life's purpose, and how they would change should you not have to work for a living (I start to see some frowning faces now... hold on a bit more!) This chapter brought back memories of reading Stephen Covey and Viktor Frankl, in terms of coming up with your life's mission. A very nice quote by Buckminster Fuller mentioned in it says: \\"I learned very early and painfully that you have to decide at the outset whether you are trying to make money or make sense -I feel that they are mutually exclusive.\\"<br />* STEP 5: Maintain a chart with your income and expenses month to month, and have it in a visible place: don't hide it!<br />* STEP 6: Frugality and tons of ways to save money -not trying to impress other people; not just going shopping; living within your means; taking care of what you have; wearing things out; doing more things yourself; anticipating your needs; researching value, quality, durability and multiple use of things ahead of time; getting things for less (find out how!); buying used (secondhand becoming chick); following the nine steps of the program; and 101 more ways... Most readers will probably enjoy this chapter, since it gives out lots of ideas you can start applying right away, but it definitely needs to be combined with the other steps for the entire program to have success for life.<br />* STEP 7: Searching for ways to increase your income by valuing the life energy you put into your job, and exchanging it for the highest pay consistent with your health and integrity.<br />* STEP 8: Having capital money start producing an income for you until you reach the magical crossover point, the point at which your expenses can be fulfilled through your investment income, technically without needing you to make any active income. Sounds neat? Well, this is the most interesting part of the book. Several pages are devoted to how you can better spend your time beyond this point, and volunteering becomes one of the biggest things (giving back) you can do to take fulfillment in your life to a point that can't be reached by making more money.<br />* STEP 9: this step is about making out of you a knowledgeable and sophisticated long-term investor, so that you can manage your finances for a safe, steady and sufficient income for the rest of your life. If you think this might be a little over the authors' heads, consider the credentials of Mr. Dominguez, who had a successful career as a financial analyst in Wall Street before retiring at the age of... (are you ready for this?) thirty-one!<br />Overall, this book shed valuable additional light on the topic of Financial Independence in ways that previous books I'd read hadn't, simply because it works onthe basic paradigms out of which your assumptions come from, such as the fact that you need A TON of money to live a life of fulfillment. If you ask me, my recommendation is to get this book, but don't buy it (sorry, Amazon!) -get it from your local library! ;)igms out of which your assumptions come from, such as the fact that you need A TON of money to live a life of fulfillment.

This is something you get used to, since it doesn't change: chapter after chapter these two Ph.D's support their research with a massive amount of data. However, the real meat of the book is summarized in these seven common denominators that the authors found underlying all those who succeed at building wealth:<br />1) They live well below their means. They live frugally by operating on an annual budget, knowing how much they spend in each category, having clearly defined financial goals and spending time planning to achieve them.<br />2) They allocate their time, energy, and money efficiently, in ways conducive to building wealth. They plan, they budget, they are active investors.<br />3) They believe that financial independence is more important than displaying high social status. They don't think that you are what you drive: in fact, most of them don't spend money on cars of the current year.<br />4) Their parents did not provide economic outpatient care: they were not helped economically by their parents, at least not in a way that built financial dependence.<br />5) Their adult children are economically self-sufficient: they don't stimulate economic outpatient care, they teach them to &quot;fish.&quot;<br />6) They are proficient in targeting market opportunities.<br />7) They chose the right occupation.<br />To close, I'd like to quote what I consider to be one of the wisest pieces of advise in the book, since it touches on a huge component of the expenses of most people, their home: &quot;If you're not wealthy but want to be someday, never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice your householf'd total annual realized income.&quot; Amen! Complement this reading with &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; and you will have paved the ground toward financial independence and building wealth.al independence and building wealth.	2002-03-06

Books	4	1	1	N	N	Packed with a lot of information, but mostly for starters	This book, the third in the Rich Dad series by Robert T. Kiyosaki is so packed with information (it has over 400 pages) that it can end up loosing the reader. But if you stick with it and learn to deal with what's become the norm in his books (that is an essential lack of editing) you will be able to take with you a wealth of knowledge that will put you on the road to become the ultimate investor. Out of the Rich Dad books this is the best one.<br />As the book is so broad in scope, I will only line out here some concepts which I hope will engage the casual reader (yes, you!) to grab a copy of this book:<br />* To become a sophisticated investor, one must know the three E's: Education, Experience and Excessive cash. He makes a lot of emphasis all through the book on this. And the point about Education he emphasizes the most. In fact, when you realize how many times he repeats some concepts, you come to the conclusion that the author is on a true crusade to educate people, and by repeating things over and over (I don't only mean in this book, but actually all through the three books) he's trying to accomplish what most teachers try to do: to help you internalize these ideas.<br />* Investing is a Plan, not a Product or Procedure: it is often a dull, boring, and almost mechanical process of getting rich... following a recipe. The problem is that some people find such dull approaches... well, dull!<br />* Types of investors: (1) the accredited investor (a person who earns significantly more money than the average person yet does not necessarily know anything about investing); (2) the qualified investor(a person who has money as well as some knowledge about investing, a person who learns that \\"If you want to be a savvy investor you need to know how to exit an investment as well as how to get into the investment...\\"); (3) the sophisticated investor (also familiar with Tax Law, Corporate Law and Securities Law, and able to use the advantages of E-T-C: Entity -choice of business structure-, Timing -not only how much you pay in taxes, but when to pay them-, and Character -of income: earned, passive or portfolio; (4) the inside investor (someone who is on the inside of the investment and has some degree of management control); and (5) the ultimate investor, a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffet (someone who creates an asset that becomes so valuable that the asset is worh literally billions of dollars to millions of people).<br />* If you can learn to build a successful B (business owner) quadrant business, your business will generate excessive cash. Then you can use the skills you learned to analyze investments an an I (Investor). Ultimately Koyasaki goes into a lot of detail in terms of what he calls the B-I triangle, which essentially is a framework for creating a business: the three sides are the Mission, the Team and the Leadership. The inside is composed of Cash Flow Management, Communications Management, Systems Management, Legal Management and Product Management. There is an entire chapter devoted to each of these, so this book could also be called \\"Guide to Creating a Business.\\"<br />The book will prove to be a valuable source of information if you are not familiarized with concepts such as tax benefits that can be obtained from running a business, basics of investing, and different types of business structures (although this is not the main focus of the book). If you are not a rookie in areas such as this, you'll probably be wasting your time with it.siness structure-, Timing -not only how much you pay in taxes, but when to pay them-, and Character -of income: earned, passive or portfolio; (4) the inside investor (someone who is on the inside of the investment and has some degree of management control); and (5) the ultimate investor, a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffet (someone who creates an asset that becomes so valuable that the asset is worh literally billions of dollars to millions of people).<br />* If you can learn to build a successful B (business owner) quadrant business, your business will generate excessive cash.

It covers in very simple-to-understand language everything that investing entails from the perspective of the Wall Stree Journal, i.e. if you were to get into and/or follow investments using WSJ as a tool, and what a tool it certainly is. The material is nicely laid out in five sections, all of which can be covered without any specific order, depending on the type of information you're looking for: they also can be read linearly, in order to get a better understanding of the complete picture.<br />The sections are:<br />-Money: allows you to better understand what money really stands for, the cycle of money, the role of the Fed in regulating the economy, etc.<br />-Stocks: from what they are, how they &quot;look&quot; like, to how the market works and what cycles characterize it, how to evaluate companies, etc.<br />-Bonds: same thing, but applied to bonds.<br />-Mutual Funds: &quot;putting it all together.&quot;<br />-Futures and Options: the higher end of investment.<br />This book, which also will not take too much time to process, contains a world of wisdom if you're serious about investing, or if you just want to better understand money and investing. Perhaps, if you're not convinced now, after you read it, you might end up more interested in investing, somthing which all of us should in one way or another do!	2002-03-02

I mean, take the title &quot;...Practical and Spiritual Steps...&quot; sounds very Deepak Chopra-ish. But that doesn't turn out to be negative at all, in my opinion. In fact, it helps the book to become yet more personal. Orman sprinkles all through the 9 steps to financial freedom stories from clients, friends and family, to help you relate to the different lessons she has to teach. The lessons themselves are really not rocket science, and several other books have already tackled them, but I consider Orman's success to be her style, which hopefully will be highly successful in conveying her message to more &quot;intimate&quot; audiences.<br />The 9 steps summarized:<br />* Step 1: How the past holds the key to your financial future. Your fears and anxieties, even from your childhood years, and how they play a key role in your financial habits.<br />* Step 2: Facing your fears (she calls them the weeds in your financial garden) and creating new truths.<br />* Step 3: Being honest with yourself. Don't hide or disguise financial truths from yourself or your loved ones. Face the truth!<br />* Step 4: Being responsible to those you love. This step starts to delve with more down-to-earth recommendations: things like wills, trusts, insurance, etc.<br />* Step 5: Being respectful of yourself and your money: the now-legendary phrase &quot;Pay yourself first!&quot; and some insights about the incredible power of compounding.<br />* Step 6: Trusting yourself more than you trust others: this goes alongside working on your financial education as well as looking for financial advisors to help you out. But be wary of the advice of those who know nothing about what they preach!<br />* Step 7: Being open to receive all that you are meant to have: deals with learning how to give back.<br />* Step 8: Understanding the ebb and flow of the money cycle. Everything that happens is positive, if you look at things from a long term perspective of your financial future.<br />* Step 9: Recognizing true wealth.<br />All in all, an OK book about the topic. Recommendable for people who have not read ANY OTHER books on the topic of personal finances and financial independence. Otherwise, make sure that you read first at least &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon.&quot;le.

George Clason makes use of a Babylonian metaphor to tell a tale that could very well have been valid back 5000 years ago, as well as in 1926 (when the book was written) and today. Having read a few of the books of the \\"Rich Dad\\" series, I can't avoid thinking that a lot of the ideas in those books most likely came out of this one. Here is a brief summary of what this title has to offer:<br />-Save 10 percent of what you earn, regardless.<br />-Control your expenses.<br />-Make your money multiply (work for you).<br />-Invest wisely and look for the advice of wise persons.<br />-Own your home.<br />-Make sure you have provisions for when the time to retire comes.<br />-Countinue to learn about how to make money.<br />The book really comes down to these few learnings, which by no means is little. In fact, the way the story is told, it's very easy to grasp, and very likely you will feel identified with several of the characters throughout it. It's such an inexpensive book and such a quick read that it's a crime not to read it. It will pay off for itself millions of times... hopefully.	2002-02-05

As much as this sounds like &quot;deja vu&quot; for those who read &quot;Rich Dad..,&quot; this book can be considered as a general practical complement to it, rather than a mere repetition of it.<br />Chapter 5 is particularly interesting as he describes what he considers to be the 7 levels of investors, ranging from the one who has nothing to invest and the borrower, to the sophisticated investor and the capitalist. It puts a mirror in front of you, by making you question which level you are in, where do you want to be and how you can get there.<br />Chapter 6 and beyond are true eye-openers for the uninitiated: &quot;the name of the game is 'Who is indebted to who?'.&quot; It becomes apparent from reading the last part of the book how easily, because of our low emotional IQ, we fall prey of our fears and greed and end up sinking further into the &quot;rat race.&quot;<br />Finally, the book wraps up with some very good pieces of advice (seven steps to help you find your financial fast track). I've already taken step 1 (minding my own business) and I'm currently working on step 2 (taking control of my cash flow).<br />As much as its predecessor, &quot;Rich Dad...,&quot; it could use more editing (it sometimes jumps between topics without much structure), yet... then again, this is not a Literature Nobel prize winner writing! All in all, the book coves some ground which the first one only insinuated. If you haven't read &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; yet, start with this one. There is nothing in &quot;Rich Dad...&quot; that this book won't provide as well, and there's a whole lot more.hat this book won't provide as well, and there's a whole lot more.	2002-02-03

Packed with tax-saving wisdom	This is the second year in my life I file my taxes (it's the second year I've worked in the US), so until I read this book (actually I skimmed through it, to be honest...) I wasn't too familiarized with the many ways in which you can save money on taxes. And only skimming through it I could make a list of at least twenty items I didn't know I could deduct from my taxes.<br />The book is written for the nineteenth year in a row by the same author who runs a column about the topic on MoneyCentral.com, so you might know him from there, but that's not all, really. It walks you through all sorts of scenarios, from the typical individual to the business owner, so that you can profit from all possible deductions that apply to your case. In fact I realized that I could be saving a ton more money as a business-owner!!<br />Finally, he covers some stories about the IRS (some horror ones, in general) but also wisely goes into detail as to why things are the way they are inside the Internal Revenue Service. Even scarier than the possibility of an audit, seemed the level of prehistoric technology they are using to process tax filings... Anyway, the central point is: for the moneyit'll cost you it's worth every penny, and will pay for itself hundreds of times. Buy it!	2002-01-21

Books	4	0	0	N	N	Best thing about it: makes you think	Robert T. Kiyosaki presents us with a book where some concepts of Stephen Covey (7 Habits) and Emotional Intelligence resound, but constrained within the bounds of personal finances. Concepts such as not letting emotions such as fear rule over your financial decisions (easier said than done, most of the time), postponing immediate gratification, and responding with a proactive mind (and a proactive language) in the face of financial adversity, are examples of this.<br />However the author has some contributions which might shock you both for their originality as much as for how the go against what's established as acceptable. Yet that's what makes the book as appealing (or discouraging for some).<br />We all agree (I hope) that money is not taught in schools, not money management at the personal level, at least. And when/where it's taught, in general it's with a great deal of care, avoiding risk. Well, the book teaches you how to manage risk, how to take calculated risks. What for? In order to make money WORK for you and have you get out of the Rat Race. This can be better understood by thinking of how to create enough wealth within your assets (and he doesn't count the home you're living in as one, so that you can begin counting it out) to pay for your monthly living expenses, so that you don't need to depend on a job for that, which is the case of most of us. The kind of assets he talks about are businesses that do not require your presence, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, income-generating real estate, etc.<br />The book also goes to some extent into some of the advantages of incorporating your own corporation, but it is by no means an exhaustive guide on the topic; it goes into why you should work not for money, but in order to learn. To have each job as a learning ground on which you can build skills which you can later use for yourself as you run your own corporation or company. Does this sound a little selfish? It might be, and that's another paradigm which thebook attempts to break: to mind your own business, meaning to do what you have to, but not to loose sight of your financial goal. The author's point is to make the best of each work experience and learn as much as possible from each. Learn about the management of cash flow, systems and people as the key skills needed for success later on.<br />As for negatives, one thing I found about the book was that it could have used some more editing. At times the author suddenly jumps between thoughts from one paragraph to the next. Ironically enough he admits in the book that he's not one hell of a writer (and that's OK), but the editor could have done a better job. The other thing is the level of the book. When you're done with it, hopefully (as it did for me) it leaves you thinking, which is a good thing, but it also leaves you with a bunch of questions. My guess is that the author just wouldn't give out the entire 'enchilada' to you in one book (after all he's a business man!) so some of the answers can be found in other books of his, or written by his associates (other authors of the Rich Dad series). Other than these two things, I found the book interesting, useful and quick to read (doesn't <BR>take anything else beyond an open mind).	2002-01-15

Sure this is a book about a diet to defy age, but he's certainly showing himself considerably more open to eating fruits (the healthy ones of course) and the idea that not all fats are created equal (Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids concept, touched in extensive detail in the book &quot;Omega Diet&quot;), which happened to be the two things that bothered me the most about the &quot;New Diet Revolution.&quot; The book also gives a very detailed account about the role played by all antioxidants (natural and supplements) and vitanutrients needed to defy aging.

So far, I'm not sure I have succeeded, but I certainly have lost some 12 pounds (lowest weight I've had in several years) and going (I've been on it for approx. 2 months). There are several things you should bear in mind about it:<br />* This is NOT an easy fix for nutritional disorders. It works, but it takes TIME.<br />* This is NOT a balanced diet, because by repressing carbs (or maintaining them under 20 g per day in the begginning) it's aimed at getting your body in a state called ketosis. In such a state the body starts to use its stored fat as a source of energy, as opposed to expecting it from carbs. There are very diverse points of view about ketosis: being such a delicate topic, I invite you to make your own mind about it, but based on what I've read about it, it seems to not be tied to the heart or kidney-related problems that are attibuted to it.<br />* It's not a static diet either, because your menu evolves as your weight does: as you begin to get to your ideal weight, the amount of carbs you're allowed increases as well.<br />* This diet requires vitamin supplements and exercise along with it, in order to work well.<br />* Most important of ALL, please check with your doctor before you begin this diet.<br />Long story short, read this book and decice for yourself. So far, I'm with it, but not too fond of the total lack of fruits that it has during its early stages. I'm combining its concepts with those of the &quot;Omega Diet.&quot;	2001-12-24

This books in the beginning helps you to familiarize yourself with the test at large: how many different sections are part of it, how many questions to expect in each, how long does it section last, ect. Then it goes into specifics for each of the sections with tips and techniques on how to best tackle each of them. Each chapter on a section of the test finishes with a quiz with real test-like questions which allows you to practice your recently acquired skills. Also, for those who haven't done any math in a while, there's a very comprehensive Math reference and finally there's a complete written practice test, just like the one you'll be taking. The book wraps up with sections on how to make it into MBA Schools.<br />However, as we all know, the meat of the GMAT consists in being able to tackle the CAT (Computer Adaptive Test), which gives you harder or easier questions depending on how well you did with the previous questions. The CD-ROM this book comes with allows you to become fully familiar with this concept, and contains TONS of study lessons. IT first takes you through an introduction to the test (so you could actually only use the CD-ROM and you could also study for the test), following which you take a diagnostic test aimed at detecting your strengths and weaknesses: very good feature, I must say! As a result, you're presented with a coherent study plan which helps you improve in your weak areas (and you do improve!) after which you're presented with another test to see how better you're able to do with the lessons learned. In my diagnostic I obtained 620, and in the actual test I got 690. This book/CD-ROM made me gain the comfort I didn't have when I started to prepare myself for the GMAT. If you need more in-depth study for the verbal or math sections, get the Kaplan Workbooks. They're every bit as good as this one and go into more depth within the sections they deal with.	2001-12-05

Not too long ago I wrote about another VB book, the one we had for our first VB class at Scottsdale Community College, in Arizona (Programming With Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0, by Diane Zak): talk about a bad book! Now, for the VBII class we're using this one. I have to agree that the evolution of the topics is not the best there can be (i.e. there is a jump between somewhat unrelated topics), but saying that it's the worst book or that you should not buy, etc. are not statements that do justice to the book, in my opinion.<br />The one thing I found about the book that I'm very happy with is the step-by-step way in which it presents the topics covered, no assumptions made. Plus the companion CD it comes with contains ALL the samples discussed in the book, which make things easy at the time of figuring out components of a program that are not visible from the code alone, because they are set within the Properties of an Object.<br />All in all I am taking away one star because of the way in which it's organized, as I mentioned before, but each topic covered is done in a very clear way, which leaves the programmer with no doubts about it.	2001-10-28

Tolkien, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; is the first of a series of books that constitute Tolkien's legacy, one which, like many other literary masterpieces, has stood the test of time. The hobbit of the story, Bilbo Baggins, is forced to face his destiny by the wizard Gandalf; one that gradually gains him the respect of his companions (thirteen dwarves, along with the wizard) and many other characters in a year-long adventure through the dangers of facing the meanest creatures and walking through the most adverse places.<br />Ultimately, the tapestry of events which Tolkien brilliantly weaves around Bilbo and his friends confront him with Smaug, the terrible dragon who has long seized the dwarves' treasure. Only the combination of luck, intelligence and a courage which he never thought he had, help Bilbo to sort through all he's faced with to come out as a better being, one that can see beyond the blindness that greed brings into smaller spirits (not necessarily because it affects dwarves more than it affects others in the story). It is there where the true greatness and universal character of the story lies.<br />The best thing about Tolkien's fantasy books is that you can relate to them in so many ways that they no longer seem so distant from what could actually occur to you.	2001-10-15

I moved here in March of 2000, and before I moved in, I got a copy of this book, after having researched all the options in a bookstore.

It gives you tons of figures and tips, ranging from how to deal with the desert weather, to how the state's &quot;lemon law&quot; works, just to name a couple of them.<br />The downside to the book, though, is the date in which it was edited: 1998. Since then (it's been three years now) lots of things have changed: area codes, population, some laws, etc. If you're looking for a state guide to use for tourism purposes, or as a daily reference guide, look elsewhere (I'd recommend Frommer's guide -it's truly complete and up-to-date).	2001-09-06

It deals with a metaphor for dealing with change incarnated in the stories of different mice 'trapped' in a labyrinth trying to find their way back to the cheese they were so used to.<br />There are those who easily adapt to change, and even are ready for it before it arrives; those who have a bit of a hard time adapting to it, but still end up getting used to it; and, then, those who will never be able to cope with change. Success belongs to the first, and partly to the second group.<br />There goes the story... Bad? Not at all, but I don't know if a book is needed to cover this topic.

If that is not achieved (the &quot;zero-loss mentality&quot;, for example) you will feel frustrated, and might even be tempted to drop the program altogether. DON'T!

Also, any changes that effect the HTML in your site, or what/how you submit to search engines, can take several weeks until you can start seizing the results for it.<br /> In order to stay current with the evolution of Web Design, and the brilliant skills of Web marketers who constantly outwit them (for a while) the algorithms Search Engines use to rank submissions vary from time to time. As a result of this, the contents of this book is almost like fresh bread: it's worth reading as soon as possible, because substantial portions of it (two thirds of it, to be more precise, which are devoted to specifics about the top Search Engines) can and will change over the course of the next few months/years.<br /> Having said all of this, I highly recommend the book.

It consists of three chapters.<br /> CHAPTER 1: SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION<br /> Dyson revisits scientific disciplines that have come about as a result of brilliant minds exploring a previously unexisting path of research. In doing so, he makes an effort to extrapolate out of today's most rapidly growing areas of science (molecular biology and astronomy) what the future scientific revolutions might be like, and gives wise words of advise to medical scientists and biologists on how to make faster progress in their disciplines by changing some of their fundamental research paradigms, learning from the ways of astronomers.<br /> CHAPTER 2: TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE<br /> In more than one way, it reminds me of a very pivotal article written not too long ago by Sun Microsystem's Bill Joy in Wired Magazine, which dealt with genetic engineering, robotics and nanotechnology, and their ethical implications.<br /> Dyson's new list of important things for us to 'worry' about gave way to the book's title. He looks &quot;for ways in which technology may contribute to social justice...&quot; by mitigating  evils such as rural poverty. This chapter is a brilliant exercise in which Dyson puts his mind to fly and actually makes his vision very easy to grasp by non-technical readers. When you read through the chapter you can almost feel that his vision is happening already, although there are some very real and respectable hurdles still separating us from it, which need to be overcome.<br /> CHAPTER 3: THE HIGH ROAD<br /> Although the book consists of three chapters, the reason for the title is more aptly dealt with in chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 3 is a little out of context with respect to the original intention of the book, yet doesn't make the reader loose interest.<br /> In this chapter, Dyson makes an incredible analysis and extrapolation about the elements surrounding our ability to find life beyond the boundaries of our planet. He believes, on the other hand, that as much as one hundred years would have to pass before we're near being able to send a significant amount of human explorers to space. But he doesn't leave readers without hope for this 'distant' future, as he lets his mind fly once again: He explains some of the exciting possible technologies he sees making massive human space exploration happen.<br /> Finally, he wraps up chapter 3 with an ethical dissertation on the topics of cloning and reprogenetics (substituting chunks of live DNA with new, supposedly 'more desirable' chunks), closing it with the following brilliant yet slightly frightening words:<br /> &quot;To give us room to explore the varieties of mind and body into which our genome can evolve, one planet is not enough.&quot;<br /> After such as closing sentence in chapter 3, I have to admit that the epilogue seemed a little weak, going back to topics already well discussed in chapter 2.<br /> It is very easy throughout the entire book (which happens to take very little time to read, by the way) to be humbled by the ease with which Dyson deals with new scientific topics (for being a theoretical physicist, he jumps very easily, for example, from genetic engineering to space science) and the clarity he has (where some scientifics lack) in terms of the importance of maintaining the feet on the ground in the light of new scientific discoveries: how expensive will a new technology coming out of a discovery will be like, how many people will use it, etc.<br /> After the death of Richard Feynman (some of whose books are among the 'scientific' books I've enjoyed the most) I thought the world had been deprived of its most brilliant teacher of science. Now I know Dyson is still with us, and this one only promises to become the first of his books I will read.out the elements surrounding our ability to find life beyond the boundaries of our planet.

Pero tambien es mucho mas. Florentino Ariza y Fermina Daza viven separados durante  cincuenta annos, a lo largo de los cuales transcurre la historia. Todo el tiempo, Florentino (un hombre extremadamente dramatico que ama la poesia y esta permanentemente vestido con atuendos casi funerarios sin prestar mayor atencion al calor del sol caribenno) se mantiene fiel al amor juvenil por Fermina que siente por dentro, a un mismo tiempo que vive una vida repleta de las mas descabelladas y comicas anecdotas de flirteo y pseudo-amor.<br /><br />Fermina... bueno, eso es parte de la historia, y no lo voy a echar a perder, pero les puedo decir que le da mucho trabajo al pobre Florentino a lo largo de esos cincuenta annos, en unas ocasiones a sabiendas, en otras sin siquiera sospecharlo.<br /> En todo momento, con el ir y venir de los personajes que me atrevo a llamar 'secundarios', tales como el doctor Juvenal Urbino, el tio Leon XII o Leona Cassiani, hay un personaje omnipresente, como lo es el medio ambiente que rodea a Florentino o Fermina. Hay incontables y exquisitos momentos a lo largo de la novela en que se solidariza con el estado de animo de Florentino, empezando a llover, por ejemplo, si el se siente triste. La sutileza con la cual Garcia Marquez logra esto es definitivamente un acto de genialidad literaria.<br /> La novela resulta una obra que todo lector esta destinado a disfrutar plenamente: una de esas obras que sin duda alguna aguantaran el pasar del tiempo. No en vano es considerado uno de los mejores libros del siglo XX. Y pueden creerme: si no se rien a carcajadas al menos una docena de veces en el transcurso del libro, les va a costar trabajo conseguir ALGO en la vida que los haga reir.<br /> Con los ojos cerrados: comprenlo, y disfrutenlo.el siglo XX.

But also it is much more. Florentino Ariza and Fermina Daza live through over fifty years of separation, during which the core of the story takes place. All the time, Florentino (a dramatic man who writes poems and is permantently dressed up in funeral-looking dark clothes with disregard for the heat of the Caribbean sun) remains faithful to the juvenile love for Fermina he feels within, while he lives a life full of the craziest and funniest love and flirting anecdotes.<br /> Fermina... well, that's part of the story, and I won't spoil it, but I can tell you that she gives Florentino the hardest of times during those fifty years, testing him, sometimes knowingly, sometimes without even suspecting it.<br /> At all times, with the coming and going of what I'd like to call 'secondary' characters, such as Dr. Juvenal Urbino, Uncle Leon XII, or Leona Cassiani, there is a big character that is always present, which is the environment surrounding Florentino and Fermina. There are countless and very enjoyable moments throughout the book, when the environment follows the lead of Florentino's mood, raining, for example, if he feels blue. The subtlety with which Garcia Marquez achieves this is nothing short of an act of genius. The novel as a whole is an incredibly enjoyable piece of literature, one of those which I'm convinced will stand the test of the ages to come. Not in vain is it considered one of the greatest books of the 20th century. And believe me: if you don't laugh very much while reading this book, you will have a very hard time finding ANYTHING to make you laugh.<br /> One final comment: if you're able to read in Spanish, grab the copy of the book in Spanish.

I have to strongly disagree with the person below who found the book dissapointing. Sure: it's not exclusively centered in Feynman, but more around his struggle to make it to this faraway, almost concealed land of Tuva, between Russia and Mongolia.<br /> It's about a man's dream and struggle to make it come true. All the books you'll find touching Feynman in one way or another come down to one thing: the meaning of life, what it is to live and fight through life, while having fun at the same time.<br /> I DO recommend this book: it is filled with adventure and shows a lot of Feynman's innate curiosity (in an almost childish way, which is good!) and perseverance (an incredible trait which most of us have a lot to learn from). If you want to learn more about Feynman's character and uncover the most unexpected anecdotes surrounding this Nobel Prize winner, check out these two other:<br /> -'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' : Adventures of a Curious Character, and<br /> -What Do You Care What Other People Think?: Further Adventures of a Curious Character.<br /> Enjoy the trip!	2001-07-22

Or should I say &quot;Negroponte rules!&quot;<br /> For those who don't know who he is, we're talking about the man who has spearheaded the efforts to make out of MIT's Media Lab one of the state-of-the-art technology workshops of the world. What those guys are working there is what you and I might own or work with (as a gadget, for instance) in a few years, depending on your wlak of life. These guys are light-years ahead of us. And Negroponte is even ahead of them!<br /> If you were a follower of Negroponte's last-page articles in Wired magazine for several years, you might not find the book all that new, but even then, you will have to acknowledge that he has a unique and very intuitive way to explain digital technology to people who are not tech savvy. He reminds me at  times of Nobel-prize winner Richard Feynman in that sense.<br /> Anyway... Think of this book, whether you are a techie or not, as a statement written five years ago about what's to come. Some of the things he refers to in the book have already occurred, which makes it even more exciting: it means that he's right, and those things that have yet to come will definitely be part of our lives sooner that we can maybe imagine.<br /> Buy it and you will devour it in a day, I predict!	2001-07-22

Coming from Windows 98, where I felt fairly comfortable and was knowledgeable enough, I can say if it were not for these two guys, I would not have been able to install Windows 2000 Professional on my machine, and set it up so that it doesn't consume as much resources; and set up my own Web Server, using IIS, just to name a couple of things.<br /> These guys took a lot of time to get down to the tiniest details you will need to know to get started, and get you going (it covers fairly advanced topics as well.)<br /> They don't only explain IIS, for example, they explain what a Web Server is, how it works, how it serves web pages to a browser, etc. So you're left we a larger knowledge about the tools you're using. Another good example, in terms of how deeply they cover topics, is the explanation they give about Windows 2000's design and architecture: almost 40 pages dedicated to it.<br /> A massive 1506-pages book that will not end up next to your phone books like some other technical books do, and one that will help you with anything you will ever need to know about Windows 2000 Professional.	2001-07-21

Complementing these are others such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Flash, and a handful of Open Source tools.<br /> This book focuses on VERY practical tips on how to fully exploit Photoshop's Photoshop, Image Ready and Illustrator to do some very common tasks which are required from a Web designer on a regular basis. These are complemented by Adobe's Go Live and Live Motion, which -in all honesty, in my opinion- have been displaced by Macromedia's Dreamweaver and Flash, in their respective fields (makes you wonder how would a merge between Adobe and Macromedia look like!)<br /> Anyway, back to the point: the book (although not too clearly stated) is mostly useful for the beginner-to-intermediate audience, as the accomplished designer will find most tips hereby included something he/she already knows.<br /> The book is extremely well laid out and broken into sections, which makes it easy to follow, and it clearly signals levels of difficulty of the different tasks explained. Sections which (for the reasons already mentioned) I did not find as useful, were related to active images, which is not the area where Adobe stands out most. Other than that, I'd say it's a must have.	2001-07-11

You can find books that cover way much more material for less than this.<br /> Second, the structure of the book. It is clear that the author's objective was to make it practical, and by grabbing several sample cases which are actually fun to implement, she gradually introduces user to the different objects (with their properties), functions, and methods available to the VB6 developer.<br /> This sounds OK, and for the first few pages (or classes) it is, but once you are past the point where you're no longer a begginner, it becomes a textbook which organizes information in a way that's very hard to go back to. The same function (the MsgBox function, for example) is covered several times within the book, each time going into a little more detail, and sometimes, in a very out of context way with respect to the material being dealt with at that point in the book.<br /> Although the author spends a lot of effort to describe step-by-step (in a fool-proof way) what the user has to do in order to add an object, change its propertis, etc. the book doesn't cover well at all (or in a consistent way, at least) how the user can better exploit the hotkeys or shortcuts VB6's IDE has to offer in order to boost productivity and efficiency.<br /> As for practice, each tutorial (that's how the sections are callled) contains exercises that refer the user to the Student Disk. Although the book comes with a CD (which happily contains the Learning version of VB6) I have yet to find any of the exercises mentioned, or the so-called Student Disk. At the end of each tutorial, the book contains a set of questions and exercises. The exercises are very good to practice the skills learned within the tutorial, but the questions deal with far too much theory, and sometimes become a little too repetitive, in my opinion.<br /> In general, I'd say the book (and in this I agree with most of the reviews here) is OK for a very early learning stage, but past the first few days/weeks learning VB6, it is not the type of book you feel like going back to, because of the way it is organized and the lack of detail with which some topics are covered, which is definitely the largest downside it has. I will always need another reference book by my side to compensate for the book's shortcomings.stage, but past the first few days/weeks learning VB6, it is not the type of book you feel like going back to, because of the way it is organized and the lack of detail with which some topics are covered, which is definitely the largest downside it has.

I have to admit I was drawn by the book's very provocative title, so I decided to browse through it today, to find that it is a very nice compilation of stories printed with permission, taken from publications such as the Wall Street Journal, The Industry Standard, Barron's and Time Digital.<br /> This is not to say that the content of the stories was bad at all. On the contrary, all of these publications are highly respectable, but if you have been a close follower of the whole dot.com shakedown process over the course of the past year and a half, and expect to find insights that will allow you to better understand the underlying reasons for it, you might be dissapointed not to find any &quot;new&quot; ones in this book.<br /> In short, in my opinion, the book does not add significantly to the whole discussion about the topic.	2001-07-08

Cuando recuerdo esta novela, todo lo que me viene a la mente son imagenes de una placentera experiencia de lectura. Una parte de mi queria que el libro progresara, para saber que iba a suceder; mientras otra parte no queria que se acabara nunca. Esa es la magia que logra Coelho en sus lectores.<br /> Yo he tenido la oportunidad de leer cuatro de sus obras: esta, 'El Peregrino', 'El Alquimista' y su mas reciente, 'El Demonio y la Se&ntilde;orita Prym'. De ellas, sin reserva prefiero con creces esta obra, seguida en segundo lugar por 'El Peregrino' y 'El Demonio...'.<br />&iquest;Por qu&eacute;? Pues porque con esta obra Coelho alcanzo la cima como novelista. Su estilo repleto de elementos religiosos y espirituales se transforma de forma casi imperceptible para dar a luz a un libro altamente realista, pero repleto de espiritu y sentimiento a una misma vez.<br /> Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados.

Out of them, without any doubt I put this one as my favorite, followed by a tied second place between 'The demon...' and 'The Pilgrim'.<br /> Why? Because in this book I feel he achieved the pinnacle as a novelist. His book is so realistic, believable, filled with such emotion, such spirit.<br /> I highly recommend it. If I could give it six stars, I'd do it with eyes closed. Although I should be careful to say that I read it in Spanish, and I don't know how good is the version translated to English.	2001-04-19

I needed a quick way to get exposed to the basics of SQL Server 7.0 due to the nature of my most recent job. Therefore I spent some time shopping, looking for the options that would allow me to achieve this.<br /> Price was not my main concern, yet William Robinson's book from the '10 minutes' series by Sams, gave quick answers to most of my questions, in a very nicely structured way: in lessons you can digest 10 minutes at a time.<br /> Major drawbacks: it refers too often to a Database you might not have installed in your machine (i.e. if you're reading the book at home in order to apply the acquired knowledge at work), PLUS there is an unnecessary sidetrack in lessons 4-8 (in my opinion). If you're using SQL Server, I don't think you'll be using it as much to interact with Word or Excel. Yet you can easily skip these lessons and the flow will not be affected significantly.<br /> Overall, I give it 4.5 stars.	2001-04-15

It teaches you how to be  critical of your own work, how to listen to what you write, how to look at  things from a different perspective (put yourself in your reader's shoes,  for example). It has so many ways in which it can help yourself, and yet,  with Provost's humor, you never grow tired of it.<br /> As of today, I'm  past the middle of the book, and I have mixed feelings: on one side I don't  want it to be over (I've just learned SO MUCH with it...) on the other I  can't help to go through the rest of it to learn all that it has to offer  (I guess I'll reread it later on, anyway!)<br /> I have not read such a small  but helpful book in a long time.
