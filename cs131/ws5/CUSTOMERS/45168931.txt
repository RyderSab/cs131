Although Mr Thor has not quite maintained the high standards of his first book, this is not bad.  A previous reviewer is right that these novels are getting very close to those by Vince Flynn and his character Mitch Rapp and while entertaining, this did feel that it was treading a well worn path.<br /><br />Having said that, if you enjoyed the previous ones, you will probably enjoy this too.  It suffers from a strong start, a weaker middle, and a good close much like the previous novels but it entertains well enough.<br /><br />If you like this kind of stuff and want a fresh take on it, I strongly recommend the British author, James Barrington.	2005-10-12
US	45168931	R5OOTX4VIOPXT	1405041773	785406520	Overkill	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Top end thriller	This is a top notch techno espionage thriller, very much in the vein of Clancy, Vince Flynn, Stephen Coonts  etc.  What great to see is that this first novel is very much as good as the best of the above authors!<br /><br />There is much to enjoy about this one, not just the plot and the writing but the strong characters and the British spin.<br /><br />This is about a plot with rogue Russians working with terrorists to plant neutron bombs in US and European cities.  Maybe elements have been seen before, but the author provides a new slant on it and takes us down some unexpected routes.<br /><br />Very enjoyable and a much needed new talent into the market.  Highly recommended.	2005-06-29

This is not a book about whether the US and Britain should have gone into Iraq, it is about the men who have to face the bullets and the consequences of their actions.  The Marines come over very well although there is an obvious mix of maturity and attitude.  They come over as brave and committed and by the end of the book you feel close to them and you hope that they will all survive intact.<br /><br />This is the plus side, but the down side is astonishing.  Some of the Marine officers demonstrate behaviours that you would not expect of a 12 year old.  Sadly it appears that most of the effective and dedicated officers mentioned have since left the Marines and some of the dangerous ones are still there, and even worse, have been promoted.  Also amazing are the tales of friendly fire and equipment malfunction (I thought poor equipment was a British thing!) and the apparent lack of planning in the `big picture'.  When the guys arrive in Bagdad there seems no plan to control the situation and bring normality back to the people, the Marines want to do this but get pulled out before they can become effective.<br /><br />This is a powerful and moving book, it shows life for the ordinary Marine and shows the swing between gung ho excitement (and the occasional consequences) and the cool professionalism of an elite force.<br /><br />It is easy to sit on a sofa at home and watch news reports.  It is also easy to have an opinion about right and wrong.  These guys did not have that luxury, they had to go and do the hard work for us.	2005-04-29

If his name was not on the cover you would not have guessed that it was him!<br />Weak characters and a story that had potential and ends up being quite dull with an ending that is almost laughable.<br />Sorry, but is is a bad one from a normally reliable and top notch author.	2004-01-08

This story has been ghost written and it reads nothing like a Ludlum novel.  Amazingly there is no tension or true thrills at any point of the book and you ended up not caring about the characters at all.  Despite the potentially interesting background I was bored from start to finish and I had a sense of relief when I finally reached the end.<br />The real crime here sits with the editor and the publisher who do not seem to realise what the reading public want and expect from a novel that has Ludlum's name on the cover.	2004-01-07

The good news is that this is a vast improvement on the previous two novels!<br />Set after Pres. Ryan has completed his term of office (about 10 years after the last book as a guesstimate) the focus here is on his son (Jack Ryan junior) and two of young Jack's cousins.  Young Jack starts to dabble in the intelligence community while the cousins are trained up to become assassins, all of them working for an unofficial part of the intelligence community and answerable to no-one.<br />It is a much thinner book then we would expect and does read like half a story and the start of the series.  Clancy must have read that some of his views of Britain had not gone down well, so he is very nice about the Brits this time!  There were aspects of the story that did not quite sit right, although set 10 years in the future, there was no sense that technology had moved forward or that anything really happened over the 10 years.  Also an assassin should blend in, having a set of twins working together in plain sight would be inclined to attract attention, but there is no mention that anyone even notices or comments that they were twins!  Thre is quite a slow build up to the main action scene which is in the middle of the book and, surprisingly for a Clancy, I felt no sense of tension or danger at any point of the book.<br />Overall, not bad but not up there with the great Clancy novels by any means.  I have to confess it came over as a little bit of a cop out, a thinner book and going back to the Ryan family.  I think the time had come to move away from Jack Ryan (senior or junior) and to give us some fresh characters, but I suspect Clancy will milk the current lot for a while yet...	2003-09-05

I was a bit concerned at first that it was almost a 'by the numbers' Ludlum story: Intelligence expert/ everyone trying to kill him / a secret organisation / everyone he talks to gets killed and so on.  At one stage the lead character breaks into a secret HQ set in the middle of no-where and I thought I was re-reading an old book by mistake, but....<br />There are enough tweaks and diversions to retain the Ludlum tradition but also bring in some new elements and the writing is good and the story works well.<br />There was also a message in here about how much of the world regards America which I thought was handled in an interesting and thought provoking way.<br />Enjoyable.	2003-03-17

The same old characters and maverick antics do not make for a great thriller.  I also had concerns at the very cardboard and stereo-typed bad guys.  Very much by the numbers and predictable stuff, a shame considering that Mr Coonts is capable of so much better.<br />Perhaps the time has come for Grafton and co to be dumped and for the author to use his talents with a new cast of characters...	2003-03-10

If, however, this is your first Craik novel then you might find that the characters are glossed over and the authors assume you understand the relationships.<br />Having said that, an in context of the three novels, I enjoyed this and look forward to more.	2002-11-14

Clancy has chosen a scenario where the tension is lost because we already know the outcome.  Where pace and tension might have been added to the plot, Clancy slows things down into turgid detail and needless repetition.  On a purely intellectual basis, insights into the Russion mind set and international espionage might be interesting, but not there does not seem much else.  I'm British and his views on Merry Olde England in the early 80's were quite accurate, but who cares unless they are put into context of the overall story!<br />Astonishingly this is a thriller by perhaps the biggest name in the business and he fails to deliver one single thrill in the entire book.

This goes off in a number of directions, some of them more interesting then others.<br />It starts full off technobabble which I found irritating before the story settles down into a sort of sci-fi 'Kelly's Heroes' linked into a flashback history of the main<br />character (with some highly telegraphed plot twists) then into a story of urban warfare and then rather uncomfortably lurches into a 'finding ones place in the universe<br />and doing things for the good of all' kind of thing.<br />Some if it is exciting (the battle scenes are well written) and there are some interesting (if unworkable) ideas about inter planet economies but overall while readable it is a little too cluttered to raise above the average.	2002-09-04

The Raven are a small but elite mercenary force and in this book they get involved in the hunt for a spell that will save their country from domination by the Bad Guys.<br />I liked the idea of the Raven and soldiers and mages working together as a team and there are some interesting ideas in the book, but it is  slightly clumsy in how it is put together.  There is a mix of everything in there, dragons, mages, soldiers, other dimensions, war etc and perhaps at times is tries too hard.<br />Certainly it took me a little while to get into it and I found the first couple of chapters a little confusing.<br />While not brilliant it is quite readable and I suppose the fact that I have bought the next two in the series is an indication that I must have enjoyed it...	2002-08-15

It would have been interesting to see more of a focus on the aftermath of the city meltdown (you get the impression that &quot;and then everyone lived happily ever after&quot;) and the plot device towards the end that has some senior navy types (and assorted women) going all SAS to get the bad guys was a little weak!<br />While not perfect, still worthy of your time...	2002-05-24

The trouble is that this book travels a well worn path and while it does entertain, it does not stand out.  There is the usual prophecy and the 'chosen one' who struggles to come to terms with who he is, there is the 'evil' sweeping in from the cold North and the latent magic in the land.  Nothing unusual there, but it is still quite a readable book and will while away an hour or two.  I would have to say (at the risk of having sexist views) that it had quite a strong female touch with a little more empathy and emotion then perhaps I was expecting.  The character eventually named as 'Tree Friend' who is the lead female in the story, communicates with trees and is a sort of friend of the earth who is linked to a magical mother figure.  A bit deep for us blokes that want lots of sword fights and shagging!<br />Not a bad entry onto a flooded market but not an outstanding one either.	2002-04-07

I had read the reviews about the game influence on the book, but was prepared to make my own mind up.

Perhaps you could forgive this if the plot and the writing were of a high standard but they aint!<br />I have a real fear that this reads like the first of a two part book, many things are left unresolved (like the Chinese take over of Taiwan) and there may be more to come.

This is written in the style of an Indianna Jones film, if you pause to think about it then it might spoil your enjoyment, this is a one sitting roller coaster of a book.<br />The scenario is interesting (i.e Area 7 itself) but the background and plot does not bear much thinking about.  The action is non stop and features some of the characters from the rather good Ice Station.  I personally think it is wrong to liken this to Clancy or others because it does lack a plot, but that is not to say it is a bad book!<br />If you like non stop action, this is for you.

A Bond book, like the films, is a journey where you know the destination but you want to enjoy the ride.  Having read other reviews I am a little surprised to find my views are in conflict with many of them.  I love Bond films and have enjoyed most of the books to date, however, this one felt...wrong.<br />Bond only makes intermittent appearences for the first third of the book and when he does, it does not feel like Bond.  I mean, he falls in love at first sight for goodness sake!  The way Draco appears from the past and how their relationship evolves was clumsy and not how we want to see a character from the past dealt with.<br />Okay there is action and a few gadgets but the real test is that if it was not a 007 branded book and was just a thriller it would be rather run of the mill.

US	45168931	R2N9ZJSG1LSOU4	0446608262	210194816	The Lion's Game	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Entertaining thriller	The danger is that the WTC incident will make publishers afraid of these kind of thrillers, I hope not because if they do, terrorism will have eroded yet another bit of our culture.<br />I'm English and started this book a month after the WTC incident and it was hard not to wince at how close to the truth this work of fiction was.<br />The lead character is a laid back smart arse but with strong cop's instinct.  The 'lion' of the title is a cool and calculating terrorist and the author links two strands of story together until finally they meet.<br />It's quick moving, witty and intelligent.  Having read this, I will be catching up on some of the author's other works as I suspect I have been missing something of value.  Great stuff.	2001-10-17
US	45168931	R3SPPIM4OFFDGM	1573225517	138260184	High Fidelity	Books	3	2	6	N	N	A little over-rated	Firstly I should state that I am English and I like Hornby as a writer, his Fever Pitch is the  perfect testament to the British football fan (okay Soccer to you lot in the States). So I was quite looking forward to this, many of my friends rate it as one of their favourite books, and it does seem to appeal to both sexes.  Having said that I was a little disappointed and I suspect that it is because of me rather then the book.  I never lived my life through music when I was young and did not associate many events/people with music and songs.  I never wrote endless lists either.<br />If that sounds like you, then this will be the book for you, if not then perhaps it is not.  Likewise it is an insight to a certain type of male, but not all males!<br />This is no bad book but I think it works if you see yourself in it.  I didn't!<br />Much as I hate to say this, the film was probably better.	2001-09-06
US	45168931	R18CW8C76CD2J2	0061020362	467408758	The Thief's Gamble (Tales of Einarinn, Book 1)	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Refreshingly different	Having read fantsy for many years I have finally learnt to wait until a complete trilogy is finished and then I read them knowing the next book is available for when I want it! The bad news is that is has been a very long weekend reading three books on the trot. Because they were worth it.<br />The female lead character is believable and the clash of different types of magic did make the usually powerful wizards refreshingly vulnerable. The narrative slips from first to second person but it is easy to get used to and makes you change your perspective on the story (the second book in the series is also like this, but is told from the first person viewpoint of a different character!).<br />I do not like to go too much into story details, but this one has depth and interest beyond the expectations you may have of a fantasy trilogy. The author writes very well and has managed the fairly unique task of a new slant on the genre.<br />Well worth seeking out and an author that will bear some watching.	2001-09-03

Over here in the UK we were lucky enough to get this some while ago and are now in eager anticipation of the next. This one is the third in the Rigante series which has a very loose base on the English/Scottish battles from way back, but you need no knowledge of British history to enjoy this, but there is a Braveheart element to it! Most Gemmell books may sit in a series but can be read on their own, this is unusual as it does rather link into the next book, but it will not detract from your enjoyment.  The flawed central character is based a little on one of Gemmell's relatives who recently died, and this was a worthy tribute to him. As always, well defined characters and strong action scenes. Ask not if this book is good enough for you, ask if you deserve to read it!!	2001-07-11

Then it went downhill fast.  Poor characterisation and assuptions that you have read the previous books and knew who people were.  And then we get involved in a half baked revolution that has killer robots mowing down the bad guys...	2001-07-11
US	45168931	R22P4P02Q6V1WI	068816112X	761772754	Replay	Books	5	2	4	N	N	An exceptional book	Okay, so guy dies and finds himself back in time in his late teenage body but with all the memories of his  previous life and the events that will take place. And then once he lives his new life, it happens again, and again and again.  With each life and accumulated experience, he tries different things... The premise of the book and what is so captivating is the &quot;well, what would you do?&quot;.  And he does do the sort of things you would do but also explores the deep levels and consequence of those actions. This is one of those books you will encourage others to read and you will read it more then once yourself. Fantastic.	2001-06-15
US	45168931	R6Q6NIYEY1B73	0399146237	1083226	Running Blind	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Entertaining but a little obvious	This was my first Reacher novel and I know that Mr Child is a popular author so I had a reasonably high expectation. I actually found Reacher a little irritating, although street smart he is too much of a loner and too inclined to be difficult.  The FBI came over as more manipulative then I would expect of your premier law agency and, while the story moved me along, it was a little obvious at times.  I predicted the methodology of the murders very early on although the who and why was a little less obvious. Overall it occupied a couple of  hours and was worth the effort but this was not the top notch thriller I expected it to be.	2001-06-14
US	45168931	RUDJR4JF609YI	0441304834	453010069	Guilty Pleasures (Anita Blake Vampire Hunter)	Books	3	8	10	N	N	Buffy it is not	Possibly hanging off the Buffy the Vampire Slayer market, this is  not actually a Buffy rip off. Set in an alternative 'now' where vampires are part of the community, Anita Blake is a tough young vampire hunter and police consultant brought in where crime appears to have a vamp aspect. She is no high kicking Buffy and often ends up battered and hurt.  However, she has a determination and drive and things do not always turn out right in the end which means her character is evolving as the story progresses. Having vampires as an accepted part of the community (sort of) and some strong support characters makes for some interesting reading. While this is no great work of art (and does not pretend to be) it is more thoughtful and interesting then a pulp vamp action novel. Certainly worth a look.	2001-06-14

Mr Cussler is starting to believe his own hype and has moved away from fast moving stories into self indulgence with tired and predictable characters.<br />By the end of this, I am afraid I was with the bad guys and was hoping for Pitt's early death.<br />Avoid.	2001-05-15
US	45168931	R7FS81LSXM4X	0312266596	559539342	Temple	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Over the top, big time	For pure escapist nonsense I liked Ice Station, a story that just kept on snowballing up.  This is similar non stop action and you need to suspend belief for the entire book.  In Ice Station the hero is a Special Forces soldier, the hero in this is a mild little archaeologist who, by the end of the book, could take on James Bond, Dirk Pitt, Jack Ryan etc single handed, so is less believable then his previous hero. To me, this was like an Indiana Jones film, a non stop rush that should not be thought about for even a nanosecond. If Mr Reilly can peg the next one back just a little there is a very entertaining book in him.	2001-05-15
US	45168931	RF0HEORNSNBS8	0515129828	699086817	Sea Fighter	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Gripping Stuff	In this third Amanda Garrett novel, Mr Cobb has improved on an already very good series. Garrett leaves the confines of her ship and leads a UN Force (with limited resources) that is trying to stabalize and protect bits of Africa from an intelligent and wily African dictator. This is strong on both characterisation and action.  I was pleased that Garrett's boyfriend was not much involved as it helped avoid all the clingy lovey stuff. The introduction of fighting hovercrafts was certainly different and the use of them plus a small corps of marines in a tactical game of chess was very absorbing. I read this on the back of the latest Patrick Robinson and it was like a breath of fresh air. This was not well publicized over here in the UK, but I am very glad I kept looking.  When's the next one Mr Cobb?	2001-03-14

Now I don't mind a military novel if it is well written and the characters are believable, but this novel fails in many areas.  The US Navy are too Hawkish and the SEALS are invincible superheroes (and how nice that three SAS soldiers are un-necessarily involved to make us Brits feel better) and the US President is portrayed as a rather pathetic individual rather then the leader of the free world! The writing is oddly stilted and I suppose the ending was supposed to have a twist, but in reality it was rushed and did not feel right. Mr Robinson has proved that he has in in him to write good navy novels and I hope he gets back on the right track again soon.	2001-02-19
