I won't try to summerize the story but you arm chair blue water sailors will love this book. I only knew a tiny bit about the journey and this book fills in all the details that would have made me pay more attention in school.<br /><br />4 stars because the naration is a little blocky. The author will just start a new paragraph to explain the history of some detail and then in the next launch back into the narative.<br /><br />But on the whole I liked this book a lot.	2005-09-21

This book is way more than that, it's a why you should use these libraries and how to book. Not a how to write the libraries, or program in C++. As such this book is geared toward the intermediate to advanced C++ programmer who has heard about [...] but isn't using all of the libraries yet.<br /><br />This is not an unbiased review, as I reviewed the chapter on Lambda as I'm one of the original authors of the library. However I'm not on the payroll so you can trust me when I say, buy the book, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Why should you care? Well boost is a proving ground for many of the upcoming C++ 0X standard libaries. Before the libraries get accepted by the standards committee, often there is reference implementation done for boost. And those that don't make the standard cut, well, often its not poor quality code, but rather a narrow focus library. Boost may have just the thing you need, so check it out.<br /><br />And as every good programmer knows, the fastest way to use new code is to get stuff that has documentation (this book) that is tested, and is free. (sorry the book isn't free, but the code is!)<br /><br />So save yourself several days of head scratching and buy the book.	2005-09-14

If you don't know your Captain Cook history this book will give you the \\"lite\\" version along with a great travelog of the South Pacific. I used to long to visit Tonga, Tahiti, Hawaii no longer. Maybe there is an Island Paradise left to visit, but it sure seems like it has died and gone. To have been on one of those first trips would truely have been to have died and gone to heaven for those sailors.<br /><br />Cook clearly has had all of the evils of the modern world attached to him by the natives. It's really too bad, as being the first, and the big name he got the blame. But really, most of the really bad stuff happened afterwards. And blame Manifest Destiny and Colonialization for the big evils. Diseases, well, there is hardly any shame here because at the time, Europeans didn't really understand the transmission either.<br /><br />Great summer beach read.

Ok, I was a climber, sort of, well I climbed some of the easy stuff near Seattle. And I realized that in order to keep the thrill of climbing up, as one gets better, you have to keep increasing the danger level. Hence the risk of injury and death keeps increasing until you decide you've had enough via an injury or your life's priorities change and your ice axe becomes a gardening tool.<br /><br />Wick, well, he seemed to attract more than anyone's share of disasters and this book accounts for that. Why would anyone climb with him? Yet he keeps going and so do others continue to climb with him. It's the climbers lie, \\"It won't happen to me\\", \\"They made a mistake I would never make.\\"<br /><br />The other great thing about this book is that it should cause every climber to look at your personal relationships and see whether you are being fair to your other life's responsiblities. Wick did not have the same sense of priorites that I have, but then I quit climbing. It's a very personal choice and no one answer is right.<br /><br />Anyway most climbing books fall into a routine, \\"the brave set out on a journey\\", \\"A sherpa/weak member gets hurt\\", \\"We make it/or not\\" and come home. \\"Weather was rough but we were tougher\\". This book looks also at the human condition of why climb at all and for that Wick should be commended for laying it all out. Like him or not, this book was probably one of the bravest things he ever did. Who among us could stand this close scrutney.	2005-08-18

The level of detail in the machining/forging of the blade and handle are excellent. This particular knife has a very nice shaped blade for slicing stuff, like apples, oranges, salami etc. The blade is mostly flat at the handle so that you can complete the cut, with the tip at a nice curve to start and draw down through the material.<br /><br />The knife is slim in the pocket, the clip can be moved from left to right or removed depending on your personal preference. Requires a small allen wrench to remove the bolts.<br /><br />The thumb kick is easy to make the blade open, requires two hands to unlock the blade and fold it back in easily. (one hand \\"maybe\\") There is a small lock on the lock itself to prevent accidental opening in your pocket or closure once the knife is opened. It's small but with a detent to hold it in place. Although honestly its never opened by accident in my pocket.<br /><br />The two side studs are to prevent the blade from hitting the inside of the handle bolsters, not for opening so don't even try.<br /><br />All in all a nice pocket knife.	2005-08-18

Book 5 just wandered all over the place. An easy 100 pages could have been cut and the story line would have been tighter and the plot just fine.<br /><br />This time the book just flows. It's really a middle book as it has set up book 7 and now of course I can hardly wait the 2 years until it comes out. The plot here is believable, there are few logic holes, the characters continue to fit their assigned roles set in book one. I envy the folks who will have all 7 books to read in one long sitting, because this is series is really just one giant book with installments.<br /><br />JK Rowling has promised that book 7 will be the end. So I'm hoping that as the story line finishes out that she doesn't break all our hearts to guarantee that its the final book. Surely she won't have to write again for reasons of cash, but if the story is somehow left open the fans will always call for book 8.<br /><br />So if by now you haven't read it, borrow a copy from one of your die hard friends, they've read it 3 to 5 times already and should be ready for a short break. And don't whatever you do, read any advance notes on the plot. You can find out for yourself what happens and it will be better that way.	2005-08-01

The author is my uncle. I spent numerous times out on calls with him when I was visiting and growing up. He  really does know his stuff about horses and kids. So the fact that these techniques were tried out on me, has made me totally biased that they work really well.<br /><br /> Anyone who is into horses, or thinking about getting a horse could benefit from a read of this book. There is just a lot of common sense. Of course if it were so common, we wouldn't have to read it! And those adults who have horses and are thinking about getting kids would benefit too! It's a quick read, we are not talking about volumes about whispering to horses. Although that does seem to work better than shouting.<br /><br />This book would be ideal for a horse training camp for the kids, or riding barn with lessons as required/suggested reading for both the parents and the kids.<br /><br />(And 5 stars is way too few for my uncle. If you've ever met him, you'd agree too.)	2005-05-30

I have to admit, before reading this book I was totally clueless about the \\"big year\\". I'd heard about life lists and scoffed. I watch birds because its interesting, I feed them because I feel guilty living on what used to be bird habitat. But I care not a whit whether or not I've seen all 600+ native species. I really enjoyed this story though. It's light reading, and very well written. I had no idea that those hummingbirds at my feeder had crossed the gulf of Mexico. I'm even more impressed. (by the birds, not the birders...)<br /><br />But that Autu Alaska is now closed to birders who could at one time get to see non native species blown over by a storm, well I don't really care. It is great though that some people remember to live their passion. And that part is what makes this book a fun read.	2005-04-22

Book one is really a linear, I go on a journey story. It sets up all the plot lines for book 2 but they really go nowhere. Book 2, things heat up, the plot moves right a long and when I started I had a hard time putting the book down. I won't ruin the plot line by repeating it here. But its alegory is that of a young girl finding herself and her place in the world. Plus the usual chases, close escapes, fights makes it entertaining even for guys.  My kids didn't like it as well as some other fanasty books they have read, but I think they under estimate the staying power of this book.<br /><br />In addition, Clive's illustrations have gotten a lot better. Practice has improved things tremendously!<br /><br />I will be awaiting book 3 at the front of the line.	2005-04-18

The fact that another \\"doomed\\" expedition had some survivers, may not have been known to the crew on this one. But its not clear that is what happened.

His lessons are also those that should be learned by all business'es. That everytime you seperate the customer from the supplier you generate a wall that makes it more difficult to communicate the customers desires and the artists creations. That each layer, the pre-press house, the producer, the distributor, the retail store each can begin to exist to only server the \\"customer\\" i.e. the next system in the supply chain. This can lead to disatisfaction for the artist who is pressured to produce mass market appealing product and the consumer who ends up with drivel. Eventually consumers walk away in disgust, artists quit in disgust and the system collapses.<br /><br />The basic business lession is that focusing, just on your customer isn't enough. You need to understand the whole product cycle and focus on that. Otherwise you're doomed in the end. Another example of course is the console & PC game industry, TV & radio programming.<br /><br />So its a good thing that Amazon lets us all vent and rave here because it helps cloe that loop. Whether any business bothers to pay attention will be reflected on their long term bottom line.<br /><br />On why 4 stars, For some of this information, the visual cues from a comic format are wasted in delivering the message.

But I'm not whining about it. I think Fred mixes up the people he hung out with, the exec's of these dot-com bust companies with the minions of others who toiled away. Fred, not everybody else became a millionaire while you wrote newspaper articles.<br /><br />Ok, so the book is cool in that it covered about 1/2 of the companies in Seattle I've either worked for, or who had friends who worked there. So its fun to read Fred's persective on it. And the arts community, well I never hung out with them, so that part is cool as well. Plus that very wild statue that is now in his front yard is well, not for me but I liked the whole story about how it came to be.<br /><br />But the whining about everybody else is making a million while I live in a house on Bainbridge Island gets a little old. I bet his family loves him and he rarely had to put up with a \\"real\\" job for the last 25 years. Besides which I bet that house is now worth 4x what he paid for it. Enough of the poor me. In the end everybody is dead anyway. Life a decent life and have fun.<br /><br />The inside scoop on the Seattle Weekly is interesting but I guess I knew most of it, (I too read \\"The Stranger\\" instead now). And in part he's wrong, there still is a Seattle sprit in this city, although there is always an element of danger with drunks and weapons in any city. We still help strangers with directions and no I don't invite them over for dinner the first time I meet them. But try that in NYC! The views of the Mts are always great, hiking is still only an hour away, the sailing is fantastic.<br /><br />If you move here and want to become a \\"Seattleite\\" join one or more of the outdoor clubs, Cascade Bike Club, the Mountaineers. Don't wait for people to invite you to a party, invite one or two of your new friends to lunch or dinner. In short be the friend you want others to be.

This book describes the boost MPL library. Its a very useful guide to this library and it includes enough examples to walk you through how to use it.<br /><br />Secondly the book explains Meta-programming. This is a new concept to a lot of C++ programmers and old hat to LISP programmers. The C++ pre-compiler is constrained to integral types as constraints. But there are a host of tricks you can use within that constraint to build libraries that adapt to their calling structure. Thus generating code that is as efficient as hand written. Of course with your compiler, your milage may vary.<br /><br />The other great thing about using this library, MPL, is that where you would write repeticious template code for every parameter in a template'd library like Tuples, you can automate with it with MPL.<br /><br />Meta programming is a pretty new concept within the C++ community and this book will give us a common language to talk about it. There are other resources on the net, but this book pulls them together.<br /><br />Highly recommended for expert C++ programmers, C++ Library writers and intermediate programmers study'ing to become experts. If you finished Andrei's book, \\"Modern C++ Design\\", this is a great next book to buy and own.	2005-01-20

I've read dozens of open water adventure books and this one is good but not great. So its worth a read for a number of reasons. One, if you are young, go on an adventure it will in general improve your outlook on life. Do it before you own a house, car, have a family of small children...<br /><br />Don't go on it to get away from your troubles, they will be on the boat with you whether you pack them in your douffle or not. Kevin and Don both needed to grow up. One gets the feeling that Don did grow up but that Kevin hasn't yet. Oh well, in all likelyhood he will. But he has a ways to go, if the destructive relationships he has with the women in this book are any indication.<br /><br />Now on the Sailing adventure part, which is why I was reading this book in the first place, its good. They have the usual storms, days just sitting, lots of general useful information like stay near the US coast until you are parallel with Hawaii, etc. Get a lighter weight boat hull than a fero cement (guck what a material!) Reef before you need to, do some shakedown cruises before you leave etc.<br /><br />But the general message I got was, just go! Get the boat, find someone who knows how to sail, and leave! Don't obsess about the what if's. Bring friends, and dramaine and books and just go!<br /><br />So its not J. Solcum's or Gypse Moth Circles the world, or Dove, but its in the same vein and I hope the sales of this book pay for some more adventures... Good luck Kevin, may the wind be at your back.

First if you are comparing \\"Code Complete\\" a book from MS which has yet to release a product that was complete, it is difficult to stop laughing.<br /><br />Every new middle manager should read this book, and stop trying to ignore 50 years of experience. Oh yeah, we live in internet time, but we still can't make a project deadline, because human's haven't evolved much in the last 100 years. Yes extreme programming has its place. It's the mini team within the 7 person teams that Brooks outlines.<br /><br />But its the communication issues within a project that kill bigger teams. Yes some programs and projects don't need this full scale project team. But try to write the flight control software for a modern jet, and you'd better be paying attention to the lessons in this book.<br /><br />Yet managers still don't learn, go find \\"Programming Disasters\\" and see some examples of millions of dollars spent and no working project. People believe that there is some silver bullet instead of trying to work within the framework that they have. No one thinks that gravity doesn't apply to them for very long and neither will they think that communication issues don't apply once they see the disaster that unfolds. Usually though the money has been spent and the company folds/the project dies.<br /><br />So pay attention! If you want \\"chief programmers\\" train them! It's not rocket science.

It's hard to take single book and spend several weeks on it and drag out very niggly detail ad nausum. So I understand why all these high school students rate it so poorly. But recently I picked up my kids copy and re-read it. And lo and behold its full of life treasures. Treat your neighbors with respect and dignity. Color of your skin doesn't equate to your worth. On the otherhand the black folks described in this book are all hard working but poor good people, except for one slightly obnoxious person that the kids meet in church. Note though the story is told from the perspective of a young white middle class kid who would not have had much contact except through the help and so the characterizations all fit true to form.<br />So read it for what it is, and when it was written and don't judge it by what you know now. In '61 life was still pretty segregated in the South and so this was a very radical book.<br />For modern readers, Atticus role as a parent was decades ahead of its time. In the 00's you'll find fathers with this outlook but in the 60's it was very rare. One can explain this from the stoies perspective because Atticus wife's death forced him to change.<br />Anyway I like this book a lot.

At least for me, I had to read a chapter or two, go out and try it, the read and repeat. The bit that helped me the most was the theory of the vang. I've used it for downwind legs to hold the boom down but not for upwind. With a bendy mast you can open up the leach by using the vang on the upwind legs too. It pushes the mast forward and induces a bend. With a stiff mast it closes off the leach. It's just one more control that I wasn't using well.<br />The terms &quot;power up&quot; and &quot;vector&quot; and used all over the place, and honestly if I knew what would &quot;power up&quot; the boat while keeping my boat pointing all the time I wouldn't need this book, but there are clues as to what will help drive the boat.<br />The text on the spinaker is also great. You really do need to keep the leading edge just at a curl and Stuart explains why. It does help, I pass boats going downwind all the time who have stalled their spinakers.<br />If you are a serious single design racer you need this book. You PHRF'ers will rarely know if what you are doing helped other than to watch the knot meter. If you beat another boat, was it just sail area and hull length? Or did you really get the maximum performance out of your sails.<br />And yes those tell-tails are key to seeing the air flow on the sail.	2004-06-30

The time is just after WWII, and China is about to go &quot;Red&quot;, the USSR is building an atomic bomb and the US cold warriors are in country. Why did the state department abandon Tibet? This story gives us a lot of information that up until now has only been hearsay. When the USSR blew up their first bomb where did they get the U235?

Also my kid liked it. Well as an adult reading it, I was disappointed. I haven't been able to force myself to finish it. If there is a story here, I haven't found it and I'm 1/3 the way through it.<br />For me the things that bug me about the book, besides the flat characters, is the mistakes in basic things like making a saddle, or riding horses, or fighting with a sword or hunting with a bow. It's clear that the author has never looked close at or done any of them. That someone shows up early with a cool sword and he lets the Dragon carry it. I mean come-on! What teenage boy would let this out of his sight? Yes he knows that he's no good with it yet but to not want to carry it???? And his mentor keeps saying stupid stuff like \\"I'll tell you when you need to know\\". Lame. Tell me now, I just asked. If I thought I wasn't ready to hear I wouldn't have asked.<br />So as they plod through the wilderness looking for evil do-ers who are way more prepared than they are, to bushwhack them as their only chance, I don't really care anymore.<br />Oh Yeah, people who live off the land don't notice a huge dragon suddenly living in the forest next to them... Arrggg!<br />Well the author is young. Maybe Vol 2 or 3 will be better. (As a reference I've enjoyed the Harry Potter series, all but book 5.)	2004-04-21

The kid is seen by my kids as a spoiled brat who doesn't appreciate the gifts given to him and the tree never learns. ARRRRGGG! We are not tree huggers but the one side \\"love\\" is not a healthy relationship between kid and tree. Skip this book and buy the poetry books. Those are worth owing.	2004-04-20

Ok, this book appeals to me, but the basic message is one that I've followed all my life. &quot;To give your life meaning, get a boat!&quot; , ok that's not quite what he says, its more like, &quot;follow your dreams.&quot; But his dream was to own and mess-a-bout in boats and that's mine too. So landlubbers aren't going to get the &quot;follow the dreams&quot; message because he talks about it in boating concepts... row when you can't see where you are going, but trust that you'll avoid the rocks.. tack if the straight way is impossible but don't lose sight of the marks...<br />Sailors will love it.	2004-04-06

I bought it because they did a trip I thought I wanted to do in a boat very similar to the one I have. After reading about the 55+ days of rain of the 70+ days of the trip I'm a lot less ready to quit my day job and go a-rowing.<br />  Anyway the couple did this after they retired, not when they were young and dumb. The had sailed the Southern portion of the trip over several summers in a much larger boat and so were well aquainted with the possible weather. However the summer of '83 was the summer of no summer and they ended up going North that year.<br /> I'm impressed with their stick-to-itness and their ability to shake off a bit of water and press on. I'm not so sure I would have kept at it. Of course I'd be thinking how can it get worse but then I'm an optimist.<br />  Anyway its another one of those, \\"you can too\\" do it books. Just get the boat, pack and go. Nothing to it, other than perserverence, good luck and some seamanship skills.	2004-04-05

But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.<br />The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.<br />Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids.	2004-02-04

Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca was truly a modern man in the way he thought about people and things. Given only his wits having lost his clothes &amp; food, he survives in a strange land for 10 years and walks out a reviered man among the natives. I had no idea anyone had done this.

Each section on the boat type is both too short and long enough. I wanted more text on dories, and Whitehalls, my favorite boats but there was enough about Bermuda fishing boats and Jersey Shore boats to pique my interest to go google them and see if I could find a modern version to look at. If you are considering buying or building a 19th century style boat this is a great guide to what you are getting. It's original purpose and design guidelines. It is not a how to build a boat unless you already know what you are doing and can read micro drawings of lines. To a master boat builder this book would be enough to a garage shop guy, only a taste.<br />I bought it to research Jersey Shore boats and ended up reading it all. A boat nuts bible.	2003-12-23

I read it to them on a long flight across the country and had the people in the seats around me listening in discreetly. It has some great morals and gems in it. About knowing who you are inside and finding your way in this world. And about the absurdity of hunting from the lion's point of view.

It's one of those beach reads, or winter by a fire with a hot drink that gets cold before you remember that its there again.

I really liked this book as it gives both a factual, names places and dates history with events that give those facts meaning. And yes the history of Otto as Holy Roman Emperor is a bit dry (that's the end of the book.) But I found fastenating that the Icelandic people all met for a week to decide whether to become &quot;Christan&quot; and under pain of invasion from Norway decided to join. And yes its not clear that the number 1000 really meant anything in particular to the average joe, but it does help one reflect just how far we've come and how far we have yet to go.	2003-11-10

Laura has managed to capture a bit of history just before it was lost to us. If she hadn't started the book when she did, no one who knew the participants in this grand drama would have been around to tell us the inside story and what story it is. Hollywood did a pretty good job with translating it to film but as usual the book is a lot better.<br />One can only hope that the healing nature of Seabiscuit's spirit can transform space and time to heal Ms. Hillenbrand. Of course if she had been healthy all those years she may not have spent all that time writing articles for those horse magazines and not discovered the basics of the story.<br />Still a highly recommended read. You may have thought of the '30s as all soup kitchens and Hoverville's but horse racing really got going here in America and Seabiscuit led the champs.	2003-09-16

I always thougth that theoretical physicists were these super smart guys sitting around the black board drawing weird diagrams of atom smashing and writing math forumulas that predict that life cannot exist and pondering the meaning of things like gravity and magnetism. Now the truth is out, they are weird, but in an normal sort of insane way. They have these great insights and then spend the rest of their lives banging away at the great unsolvable problems like &quot;what do women want&quot; and &quot;where to find a hotel in city that's full up.&quot;<br />I really liked this book. It brings out the human side of Dr. Feynman. I've read his lectures on physics books and they are dry and full of stuff I've long forgotten. But after reading about his adventures with the California state school system in picking a science text book had me rolling on the ground laughing. As a student I always wondered how these bad textbooks got sent down to torment me and now I know. It surely wasn't Richard's fault!<br />Anyway a good read about the life of one who saw life through a different set of colored glasses.	2003-09-16

Barabara's philosphy is that most dog problems are &quot;owner&quot; problems. That dogs key into what their owners are thinking. That said, Barbara uses corrective training techniques with a choke chain. The current thinking is that you need to also use &quot;reward&quot; based training.<br /> Some trainers use only one of the other. I claim you need to tailor it to the particular dog. Some dogs couldn't care less how much you yank them around by the neck, others will quit behaving after they've had enough treats. Anyway reward based training requires lots of variations in the reward, sometimes its a game of frisbee.<br />With corrective training you need to assert yourself as the head of the pack. Seems to work well with some dogs, especially those more alpha pack dogs. But all dogs require lots of rewards to be well adjusted. And as you can see from the cover photo Barbara does reward her dogs.	2003-08-18

I have a friend who uses a ring as he's more interested in the &quot;fishing&quot; than the &quot;catching.&quot;<br />The one bit he didn't mention, is that losing that expensive SS trap is a killer for crabs. In Washington you must secure the hatch with bio-degrable string so that if you do lose the trap it will stop fishing. Otherwise the dead crabs self bait the trap and the cycle continues for 10 year or more until the trap fully rusts out. Check out the Fish &amp; game pages for Texas and Alabama where during closed seasons they removed over 2,000 lost traps each.<br />Also Charlie left out my favorite crab &quot;catching&quot; technique which is to put a fish head on a line and toss it out. Wait for the line to &quot;walk&quot; and then slowly pull it in. Near the surface net the crab! Well that's the way it was supposed to work, and it sort of does, well it did for Carolina blue claw crabs. And its great fun for the kids.<br />Anyway another great book by Charlie.	2003-08-13

The whole Mercury program, the behind the scenes politicing, the trips into space. And then the book gets weird. It is always interesting when public figures give UFO accounts but it would have been nice to have some backup documentation rather than vague acusations about area-51 and the government hiding things. This government doesn't seem to be able to hide two people making out in an office nevermind capturing space aliens, transporting their ship somewhere, figuring out how it works etc etc. If two people can't keep a secret can the 100's that would have had to be involved in such a coverup keep a secret?

And a journey of letting go of the calendar, of people I used to depend on. Its also a journey of a single day, as in I planned to do this, but found myself here instead. Yet if I had followed my original path that would have been ok too.

Since then the standard libraries were added, a full implementation of templates and exception handleing etc. So while its a good reference for the &quot;core&quot; of C++, i.e. the classes etc, it shouldn't be the first book (or even the 2nd) on C++ you buy. Better to get the Hardcover &quot;The C++ Programming Language (Special 3rd Edition)&quot; which has chapters on all of the language.<br />Note: That's not the first book on C++ you should get either, if you are just learning, it is however one you should own if you are going to profressionally write C++.<br />On why there isn't a second edition of the ARM, has in part due to the restrictions for republishing the ISO standard. And its also 2003 and now the language looks like it will continue to evolve and thus a second ed. ARM would be soon out of date as well. Maybe we'll be lucky and there will be one for C++2005.	2003-05-19

Folded, they are about the size of a post card so you can easily carry it in your pocket. They have all the major toursit attractions on them and the streets are clearly marked, along with major transit. (In this case the Street car stations.) The San Diego map also has a section on Balboa Park and the Zoo. So its another great deal.	2003-04-30

Has all the major tourists points, the colleges and the streets. Also shows the boat livery's for rentals for punting. The city of Oxford has maps supplied by Blackstone books, but on them is missing a &quot;You are here&quot; mark. Also they don't show the spots I wanted to see, but they do show a number of bookstores. So I was still glad to have my own map with me. The nice thing about these maps is their size. Folded, they are about the size of a postcard so are easily carried in a shirt pocket. It's a good deal and if you are visiting you'll be glad you have it.	2003-04-30

It makes me want to get a canoe, load it with my tent, bag and go. It's a modern version of [[ASIN:006095955X A Walk Across America]]; or [[ASIN:0865475091 Caught Inside: A Surfer's Year on the California Coast]];. Part of the reason for only having sketches of the people he met is that on a journey like this one, you don't have time to fully know everyone you meet. Also the book would have been a tome that only the most dedicated would be able to plow through.<br /><br />It also turns out that this journey was inspired by Howard Blackburn's trip which is described in [[ASIN:0684872633 Lone Voyager: The Extraordinary Adventures Of Howard Blackburn Hero Fisherman Of Gloucester]] (also highly recommended)<br /><br />Recommendation: Read!

How men endure when they run out of food, then water, then people start to die. It's a fairly fast read and Owen gives a fairly good account of the problems and the horror of the men as they watch the whale ram their ship.	2003-03-31

You do have time to watch paint dry, and wood rot, and canvas sag while waiting for a breeze. What I liked about this book was the description of California before it became \\"civilized\\".<br />If you are looking for close calls with pirates, and lots of rambo action, look elsewhere. If you like history books that tell it like it was, then this is for you. Moby Dick is a good litnus test, if you liked Moby Dick, you'll like this, if not skip on to something else.	2003-03-24

First I really liked this book.<br />Second there have been a lot of reviews about whether anyone could have made this trip, well without giving the story away, some didn't make it. But it never ceases to amaze me what the human body can endure if the mind pushes it hard enough. I suspect that the distances mentioned in the book are too long. &quot;How far did we walk today Bob? Well we walked all day, my legs hurt, probably 20 to 30 miles!&quot; So much for estimating distances when you don't have a map or any clear idea where you are.<br />Third, crossing the Himlalaya Mts, I suspect that they lost track of time and crossed just as winter was ending. Rather than in Feburary. This would explain their meeting sheep herders up high in a cave. Hardpack snow would be difficult to cross in just moccosins but drifting snow up to a foot or so it could be done. This is the footware of the Native Americans in the Northeast.<br />Fourth, the desert part, this is hard to believe lasting 2 weeks without water, as the lack of water should have finished them off after 4 days. But part of water loss is tempeture related and they may have been more on the edge of the desert than the map in the front of the book makes out. Plus these people's bodies were well hardened to abuse by their previous time in the camps and the journey to the desert.<br />Fifth, the stay in the Soviet Stalinst justice system sure reads like all the other books. Now either Slavomir still bears the scars of this visit or he doesn't and from his tale I can't imagine anyone makeing this up. It's not a pretty site and not one where he's anyone's idea of a hero.<br />So all in all I'm inclined to give Mr. Rawicz the benefit of the doubt and to ask any other doubters why lie? And if he did, well how did he manage to get from Poland to India?<br />Anyway its a great read.	2003-03-24

I've had this book for 20 years and made nearly everything in it. The only recipe which I think must have a mistake in it is the &quot;pepper&quot; brownies. I've never been able to make them come out, and I've varied the cooking times, the tempetature, the ingrediants etc.<br />Ok, my favorite is the &quot;French Chocolate Mint Truffles.&quot; You can vary this one to your heart's content. First, you can roll the results in &quot;dipping chocolate&quot; get a bar of high quality chocolate heat on a double boiler and use a fork to dip the cured truffle, place on wax paper to cool. Second, you can use almost any flavoring, almond, coconut, orange, lemon, peppermint, etc. Third, you can use milk chocolate, if the the mix starts to thin when you heat it, add a tablespoon of powdered sugar. Fourth you can use white chocolate although this is tricky and requres a lot of powered sugar to get it to &quot;set&quot; like a 3 to 5 tablespoons of powdered sugar. (With the coconut ones I mix in a 1/4 cup of grated coconut.)<br />Ok, then the basic brownies, ooooh you'll never buy a box mix again.<br />Then the flourless cakes, so rich, its incredible.<br />On to the &quot;Pots of Creame&quot; Yum, you'll have people begging for more. The trick here is to use a pan to hold the pots in, put the pan with the pots in it in the oven, then add &quot;boiling water&quot; and cook for exactly 22 minutes. The centers will be smooth and look runny but they'll finish cooking as they cool. Also be very careful getting them out of the oven, hot water will go right through your oven mitts. I use a canning jar lifter to get the pots of creame out of the pan. But in any case please be careful the burn you could get is bad.<br />I could go on and on, but if you can follow directions they all seem to come out fine.	2003-03-20

There is a warning in the front of the book that this one contains bad language, and he isn't kidding. I'm a fan of murder mysteries and there is some mystery here, but not a lot. I like those werid Floridain mobster kill/sex/drugs books, and there are a number of them but this one is better than those. At least the comdeic elements can make you laugh, although if this were to really happen, no one would be laughing. So if you liked Big Trouble you'll like this one.	2003-03-04

Since this is Lucy's book, Robert comes off looking like a total jerk. So its amazing she didn't kill him early on. Also it was Gerald's idea, do the island, get the girl and write the book. From reading the book, it's Lucy who plants the garden, learns to fish, talks to the natives, and keeps Gerald alive so with Lucy actually writing the book I hope she made a fortune.<br /><br />The other cool thing was how hard it was to find an unoccupied island to do the test on that you could also survive on. Turns out if you have water and decent soil, people already live there! This shouldn't have been a surprise, but it was to me. I should have figured that in the last 1000 years people of the South Pacific would have looked at all the islands, and stayed on the ones that supported life. So much for the Swiss Family Robinson dream life. It's actually much closer to the Tom Hanks Movie \\"Castaway\\" life.<br /><br />Anyway its a good arm chair adventure read.	2003-01-21

More story line, more plot! This book hints of what is to come and I'm hoping that the next books fill in all the details that are missing in this book. So I'm being generous with 4 stars.<br />Also Clive can't draw women, or sailboats! The illustrations are generally ok. In that its nice to have so many, and its clear that he got better the more he painted, but I can't help wondering if he hadn't illustrated his own book and spent more time on the writing if it would have been better. Also there is way too much primary color painting. It's like he didn't have the technique of mixing colors. And no to very little perspective, people and things are flat, flat, flat, ok, ok, the illustrations aren't the reason to buy it. Clive take some art classes and more do live drawings! Go down to the docks and look at sail boats, look where the sail is when the wind is blowing and where the people sit. Look at buildings, they aren't flat, take a perspective drawing class. Use a pencil and put in some light perspective lines to guide your outlines.<br />On the good side, the world is cohesive, and compelling. By this I mean, the rules of the world stay the same for all the characters all the time. No plot tricks by suspending a rule so the heroine can escape or be caught. I like that a lot. It also stayed up late to finish the book another good sign. I cared about the heroine, I want to know more.<br />This isn't Harry Potter, there is an element of horror to the story so it isn't for young readers. On the other hand it isn't a horror book either. So mid to young teens seems to be its intended market.	2002-12-31

His basic take is we buy what we want, it isn't foisted on us by advertsing. All that you see on TV is an ad, including the \\"news\\", the sitcom set, ie house, clothes, pots, pans, lamps and has been since the beginning of TV. And that \\"Democracy\\" is the freedom to buy what you want when you want it.<br />He makes a good case that this has been what people \\"really\\" want since time imortal. And that no amount of whining about how it isn't good for you can compete with the almighty dollar. Simply put, if you really didn't want it, you wouldn't buy it.<br />I do agree that he can get long winded in his arguments.<br />Anyone looking to start up another .com company would do well to read this first.	2002-08-15

This is that book. There are hundreds of well drawn excerises, orderd by muscle groups. Bill lists suggested routines for lightweights, advanced and pro programs. Each with a suggested number of reps and a reference to the page which describes the drill. What's great is that if he recommeds working out on a lat pull down, and if you don't have a Lat machine, just keep thumbing you'll see exercises with barbells, dumbbells etc. all of which work that set of muscles.<br />My only complaint is that I'm worried that advances in back medicine have made changes to workout routines so that injuries would be reduced since this book was published. So care should be taken in selecting the amount of weight one should lift for any given exercise. And perhaps a recent exercise book should be consulted in addition to this book. But on the other hand I've been doing the routines for a while and haven't felt this good in a long while.<br />The other bit that I like about this book is the attitude. Body building is also part attitude and you need a good one to go with those new muscles. Being kind to those you work out with is as important as doing the reps. The basics you know, treat the gym equipment well, don't show off at the gym. Do that at home (no worries with me!) So I recommend this book.	2002-02-22

Of course once you buy this one you'll want the rest, so you might as well take advantage of the reduced shipping and just order them all.

Dave Berry calls them humor impared, and well there is no cure. But for the rest of us, if you've ever spent any time fishing, camping, or just messing around outside as a kid, these are the books for you.<br />One other note: You can't lend these books out, they don't come back!

I had an old Sakoda model of a the flying horse but this one far exceeds it.<br />Montrol models tend to be complex, with many many folds. The detail of the three headed dragon is amazing.

Granddad was a driven guy who forced everyone into the family business. R. was lucky to escape to become a no-account writer. Well books turn out to last longer than bricks. But still, its amazing to read that some of these lighthouses took ten years to build. The first summer's work having been washed away by the winter's storms. Plus the social aspect of the coastal towns which made their living from plundering the treasure (recycling?) of wrecked boats. They weren't all that interested in helping to put these lighthouses up. Eventually shame at the death of the sailors and persistence by the Stevensons got the job done.<br />Anyway if you love books about the sea, you'll like this one.

If you refuse to use perl, which incorporated most of awk, or have to maintain old awk scripts then this is the text.  I like the O'Reilly text for learning the basics, but after that you need this guide.  For some tasks awk is the premier solution, for others, use awk as part of the solution along with perl and a shell script. Still a cool language. And this book is very helpful for both beginning intermediate programmers of awk and advanced users.	2002-02-12

Having said that, I can no longer remcommend using vi, instead if you can switch to vim. Vim is the next generation of vi...There are loads of plugins etc. There is a Vim text, (not as good as this one but it has to cover more stuff) But if you can't get vim, and dread learning emacs. This is the vi book for you. It covers regular expressions as understood by vi, it has all the basic set commands, the buffer control etc. It was originally written for internal classes at HP, but since there wasn't any other good vi books they have allowed general publication.

They fly less well than a good paper airplane but they do fly. Especially if you put a foil nose cone like the book suggests. Then it flies more like a paper dart. Also the foil nose cones give the rockets a more &quot;rocket&quot; like look. Ok maybe I'm easily amused, but I've folded a lot of different models some really hard and I wanted a book that had good intermediate models that would interest my kid, and wound up liking them myself.	2002-02-06

After all I can make STL complaint containers, I can write iterators, I've written several expression template libraries all of which use templates in as complex a way as I thought it was possible. But then I read the chapters on ObjectFactory, AbstractFactory and Smartpointers and I was humbled.<br />Ok, this book is NOT for C++ newbies. It's for folks who have access to gcc, or another decent compiler and that's nearly everyone, and who want to know what C++ is really all about. It's not just &quot;C&quot; with classes. Those C++ templates may have started out as a replacement for MACRO's but they are not limited by that. In fact, in some cases they are a poor substitute for a good MACRO. But in Andrei's hand, they are code generators magnificant! if you are an intermediate programmer having read the Meyer's books, and have embarked on &quot;IOStreams&quot; by Langer and Kraft then you will find this book will stretch your mind even more.<br />  That said, this area of programming (generative programming) is moving fast. There are already alternative ways of specifing template arguments, the policy concept has turned many a programming idiom on its ear, so I am looking forward to a &quot;Yet More C++&quot; title from Andrei next year. It's won't make this book obsolete but it will expound upon the concepts presented here.<br />Don't buy this book if all you have is MSVC 6.5 (They have promised that in the first patch of 7.0 to have most of what we need for the code in this book.) First go to the gcc home site and get ver 3.0 for your system. Get comfortable with it, then go get a copy of this book.<br />This book is what &quot;Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms&quot; by Colien was to C++ when it first came out. (Another good classic text.) You'll also want a copy of &quot;Design Patterns&quot; by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides to have by your side when you are reading about the templatized versions of the patterns in Modern C++. The two books speak in different languages about the same problems and between the two of them you will understand the issues better.reading about the templatized versions of the patterns in Modern C++.

This message is repeated over and over, in many very helpful ways.<br />When I was first seperated, I was a victim of cloudy thinking, life as I knew it was over. And while that was true, it has become a spring board for personal growth and a new life. It's the no pain, no gain theory of life.  While I would not advocate this life experience as good plan, if it happens to you, you might as well use it as an opportunity to grow.<br />While it has been a number of years since the divorce, I still found some good information about myself within the pages of this book.  Plus it was an affirmation that the course I was on is the right one.  (Also people thinking about getting married, might do well to read this for the information on how not to choose a mate, as Ms. Ford goes over what happened with her marriage. The misplaced expectations and poor commuincation.)	2001-01-29

(Quit your whining its nearly free code.) I can't vouch for the Hisss VB interface, but then I'd drive a cab before I coded with VB. There is one serious bug but its from a typo. Email me and I'll send you the patch.<br />On to the good part. This is the first good Fuzzy Logic book I found. I've read several others before I got to this one and each one left me more confused than the rest. Earl finnally explained what its all about and what sort of problems this technique solves. There is a bit of &quot;Fuzzy Logic is better than Neural Nets&quot; but no real concrete examples to prove it. I ignored that and used his examples to learn how to do this and his code in some game AI. It worked well.<br />Also in case you don't know the thing that Fuzzy logic does well is smooth out transistions, ie it keeps things from oscillating between two single states. It's also good for when you have multiple inputs all of which contribute to deciding whether a threshold has been reached. You set weights to the inputs contribution and analyize the result, meets the threshold or not. You can also adjust the threshold depending on the state of the object. Coupled with a Finite State machine and you've got a basic game AI.<br />I have also taken some time (about a week) and cleaned the code up. It wasn't too difficult and I now have an OOP interface to it which made things a lot easier to understand. Earl obviously has a for sale system using the original code. He must have cut a chunk out and put it on the disk. I also have about a dozen emails from him, and I've sent him the updates. He's a busy guy, bug him to put the fixed code on his site. Maybe he'll get around to it.	2000-10-23

I'm a vetern C++ programmer and I tried to create a fuzzy logic system from the concepts and code in this book and it didn't work out at all. At first I blamed myself then I found some other fuzzy logic books and realized that no, this book just wasn't able to articulate the concepts in a meaningful way.  The Neural net code was even worse. I wanted a cook book, do this, get a simple net, do this get a simple fuzzy logic system, now take what you learned and make a real one. Nope.<br />They do go over the AI terms and types of Neural nets and I did learn something by reading about it but not enough to justify the price of the book.	2000-09-21

These are compile time constructs for generating  code, not the resulting executable code. All cool stuff. There have been  some advances in this realm of coding since this book has been published,  but for the most part this is a good reference text. (Its an area of  programming that is moving fast.)<br />The complaint about this book for JAVA  programmers is legit, JAVA without templates or some other meta language is  an inappropriate tool to do Generative Programming. That's not a slam on  JAVA its just the way it is. Screws and nails, the right tool for the job  at hand.<br />The discussions on design methodologies is pretty dry. If I'm  having trouble sleeping, reading a chapter on it will do the trick. However  there is a great chapter on &quot;Feature Diagrams&quot;. These are a great  addition to any design document as it can show what things are missing.  After applying one to the VTL library we realized that we are missing a  shared reference base.<br />The best part of this book is that each chapter  starts out with a paragraph of why you should read that chapter. Would all  technical books do this, I would be forever grateful. There is also a  summary of the important points in the margin. Feels like I'm reading an  annotated text, again a great writing style.<br />C++ code design is hard,  mostly because the problems we are trying to solve are difficult. The real  world is messy. (Witness the Zebra, looks like a horse but isn't.) The  formalism this book brings to the table will help create better  designs.<br />Recommended for Advanced C++ program designers, and anyone  writing generic libraries.	2000-08-31

Stroustrup book. Without  dwelling too much on the arcane, Bjarne goes over all of the reasons for  the additions to the &quot;C&quot; language to create C++.  Bjarne comes  off as a guy just trying to get a job done and yet do what is right for the  rest of the programming community. Its a nice change from the almost  religious furor discussions that occurr on USNET.<br />There are still open  issues among the users of C++, people who want a feature found in another  language, or wish that their personal idea would be incorporated into the  general language. Before posting a proposal to comp.std.c++ you should read  this book. There you will most likely find a discussion on the idea and why  it is either not implemented, or was rejected. Then you can organize your  counter argument without wasting everyone's time. (Also one of the first  counter posts will be a citation to this book.)  It's not that C++ is the  perfect language, it isn't, after all my pet idea of overloading  operator.() was rejected, but in ammending the ISO99 C++ standard you need  to know what has already been discussed. So we can go forward without  rehashing.<br />Intermediate C++ programmers would also benefit from the  discussions on casting, use of private/public/protected inheritence and  scoping, and exceptions. Bjarne goes over why these things changed over  time and what problems these features are intended to solve.	2000-08-29

(I don't know too many people who appreciate being pointed out  how dumb they are weekly.) Then someone who appears to have nothing better  to do than solve C++ puzzles jumps in with a 6 page submission on how to  solve the problem, which is usually wrong. Then six more self appointed  guru's jump in and fill pages of discussion, Then after filling my head  with all the wrong answers to a particular problem, Herb smuggly answers  the question with the real answer. Anoints another guru and the process  repeats.  In the meantime I've lost total interest in the discussion. Thank  you for Deja news where I can read the first and last postings(The puzzle  and the solution).<br />  That said, this book is full of those got ya!  puzzles.  Fortunately Herb is a kind writer and you don't feel too dumb  when he points out why a particular puzzle has a problem and what it is.  And like Deja news you can skip all the wrong answers, arguments about the  arcane and get right to the meat of the problem. Herb also got a chance to  make the puzzles more clear, where the language of the original puzzle  confused the issue unnecessarily.<br />  The best reason to buy this book is  that its the only published text so far on how to use C++ Exceptions.  There are some articles in C++ Report but not many on the traps and  pitfalls of their usage.  Stroustrup's book &quot;C++ Programming  Language&quot; tells you how the mechanism works, and makes some  suggestions. Herb tells you what it will cost you if you don't use them,  only partially use them, or totally abuse them. And he shows you how a  minor misuse can make you have major problems.<br /> I can see why Scott  Meyers likes this book. Its just like his books, &quot;Effective C++&quot;  series only the format is not in a lecture topic but in a question/puzzle  answer format. I prefer the Meyer's approach but you can still glean the  necessary information, and while you are reading the answers to the  puzzles, say to yourself &quot;Yeah I knew that!&quot;<br />  One other reason  to buy this book, you can use these puzzles as tests for interviews. First,  it will help you know the skill level of the applicant, Second it will  teach you something you probably should have known anyway, Thirdly if they  get the answers right off it will tell you that the applicants at least  read the texts and are trying to stay on top of things. This is not to say  you should make applicants take an all day C++ grammer test but by asking a  few puzzle questions you can see how they react under a bit of pressure.  After all at some point everyone comes up against a problem they haven't  seen.efer the Meyer's approach but you can still glean the  necessary information, and while you are reading the answers to the  puzzles, say to yourself &quot;Yeah I knew that!&quot;<br />  One other reason  to buy this book, you can use these puzzles as tests for interviews.

It is clearly presented, and  the underlying design choices are explained and expanded on.<br />A word of  caution, the topic on Smart pointers is interesting, but don't just copy it  out, get a tested version from the C++ library &quot;boost&quot;. Its like  the string class every text seems to use, copy it, use it to learn from but  don't use it in an actual project. You'll just have to go through the  debugging process that everyone else has already done.<br />This book focuses  on C++ Design and that is a hard subject to teach well. The mechanics of  the language are much easier to master, the putting it all together in the  correct way is what this book focuses on.<br />I'd also like to say that I  think this book is better written than any of the C++Report articles that  A.Koening wrote.  My guess is that the review process is more stringent and  he and B. Moo had more time to work the text over. In any case it is one of  the easier to understand and read intermediate level C++ books.	2000-08-23

So the Editors have  carefully changed the story of the African Chief who wished to become  Cacausion in appearance to one where he wishes to become a lion.  Now, I  agree that the story is better this way, but mucking around with books  after the author is dead and can't defend or fix them is right out.  So in  that vein I can't recommend this edition of this book. The editors should  have changed the title to &quot;The Modern Dr. Dolittle&quot; or some other  name which implies that the story isn't the orginal.

Junger, I was casting about in the sailing/adventure section and found this gem. I remembered vague readings from the newspapers about the sinking of these ships and that it seemed a  really dangerous business, crabbing in the North Bering Sea. Mr. Dillion  explains it better than any other article I've read. He puts a human face  on those missing fisherman.  The book isn't quite as much as a thriller as  &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; is but I was hooked and stayed up most of the  night to read the first half.<br />The second half of the book is the  formation of public policy and the making of the laws regarding safety at  sea. Its a bit dryer but since I voted for some of these politicans I'm  glad that they did their job. That aspect of the story wasn't reported very  well in the local news. It is interesting but not the page turner that the  first half of the book is.<br />Still whenever I buy King Crab legs in the  grocery store I say a prayer for the saftey of the fisherman.<br />Anyway if  you liked the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot;, or any of the other disaster at  sea books, &quot;Fastnet Force 10&quot; etc., you'll like this one.	2000-08-01
US	52693154	R1VILHOUJD10UA	0345420039	491910707	A Viking Voyage: In Which an Unlikely Crew of Adventurers Attempts an Epic Journey to the New World	Books	4	10	16	N	N	Even non sailors can survive with the Coast Guard handy	I liked this book, because it meant that if a duffus like Hodding Carter could sail from Greenland, I could too. After all I know how to sail. As for proving that its difficult to do, well, he finnally admits to realizing  that they don't call Maine &quot;Down East&quot; because its lower than  Boston, its because its &quot;Down Wind&quot; and when you sail a mostly  square rigged vessel, its really hard to go &quot;Up Wind.&quot; So Hodding  proves that while its possible to go from Greenland to the New World, it  was a pain. So any Vikings would have abandoned the effort as not being  worth the trouble. Ok. But other than a vague feeling these guys should all  have died at sea with their general lack of sailing or open boat skills it  was a fun read. I doubt I would have gone along though had I been asked.	2000-07-25

I liked this book because it is written as if you are asking a relative what they did during the war. No one's story is too long, unlike my relatives who go on and one. (That's the author's trimmimg.) Yet I was  fastinated.  There are lots of big piture histories and if you know that  history, fitting in the scene from a person on the ground is really very  interesting. It's the why we fought, not for your country, but rather once  on the line, not to let your buddies down. The feeling of regret when you  finally meet the enemy and he looks just like you.<br />Anyway I'd read  &quot;Working&quot; by S.Turkel and liked it. This books is written in the  same style.	2000-07-25

I had heard that pressure cookers were the microwave ovens of the 50's. Then after several people blew them up by overloading them they lost favor. I borrowed one from a friend and bought this book. After making chilli in 20 minutes, and lentil soup in 10. I was a convert.<br />I  now own 2 cookers, one really large one (16qt)for making spagetti sauce and  stew, and one medium large one (8qt) for soups.<br />The one thing the book  doesn't really cover, is that once the top is on, there is no stiring,  (duh!) So if you leave it on high heat, it can burn the thick sauce  recipes. So I always heat the mixture until just to simmering, lock the lid  on and then cut the heat to medium. It takes a minute or two longer for the  pressure to come up but I rarely burn soup any more.<br />Also, if you haven't  bought a pot, get a big one, when you fill a pressure cooker, you only fill  it 1/2 way. So a 8qt pot, is really good for 4qts of soup. If you have time  shop estate sales. That's where I got mine. The pots last a long time, and  many who cooked in the 50's will have one that is just fine. (You can get  new seals from the presto company.)	2000-05-03

The first 50/100 pages set the stage for the rest of the story, its slow going. But once you are past that it sort of brings you into it and you will wish there was a sequel.<br />I also found interesting the whole story about the manuscript, and how it nearly wasn't published at  all. For me this story was the reason I gave the book a chance. I'm glad I  did.<br />Also on the plus side, once the world rules are set, the characters  stay within them. No werid twists to the rules to make the heros escape  their fates. I really like that in a fiction book.<br />If you liked  &quot;Time and Again&quot; or &quot;Islandia&quot; You'll like this book.  (Not that the plots are similar but that the way the world is constructed  is.)	2000-05-02
US	52693154	R1G7R0KTG9NT9V	0253329639	533857287	Sherman's Horsemen: Union Cavalry Operations in the Atlanta Campaign	Books	5	10	13	N	N	A great read, and showed the futility of the actions	The descriptions of the cavalry charges are wonderful and terrify'ing. I would have hated to be on the slashing side of those swords.<br />On the other hand the ablity of the South to repair the damage done by the raiders is remarkable. It made me realize the futility of distroying low grade rail  and bridges. These guys would burn a bridge, and 3 days later it would be  completely rebuilt. Not really slowing down the pace of the war at all.  Sometimes the repairs were done before the raiders were back in camp!<br />It  was incredible the amount of useless looting that went on. Soldiers  stealing tableware &amp; clothes only to toss it as soon as they were  attacked.<br />Another great civil war read. (For those fans of wars in a  bygone era.)	2000-05-02

It's a great read. It made me realize how the builder blew it when they made my house. One small design change, the house is 1 ft too narrow makes it impossible to put a screen door on the front door. It made them build a  extra platform which causes people to fall down into the living room.<br />On  the other hand, if I was building a building I'd use his visualization  techniques before I drew plans. But I wouldn't use this technique to  actually construct a building. It would triple the cost. (The essence is to  build it as you need it.)<br />On the other hand he explains why swiss barns  look &quot;alike&quot; without the need for a design review committee. (Or  barns in general.)<br />As for software, Design patterns give programmers a  way to talk about problems and solutions without talking about code. Its a  great idea and I use software patterns all the time. (Get the GOF book for  actual software patterns.) Read this one to understand how they came onto  this idea.	2000-05-02

Porter's success on the Mississpi river prevented the southfrom using it to transport goods and men anywhere. He effectively cutthe West out of the war by maintianing control of this river.<br />The book reads as well as any by Bruce Catton. If you think that the Civil war was fought only on the ground, this book is for you.	2000-05-02

People will be laughing for hours as they look at all the loney pictures.<br />My favorite is the &quot;Montana Double date&quot; (Two unsaven cowhands and thier dogs in beat car.) And while I  like Montanian's this picture of the 2 near-do-well's and their dogs just  was great.  So if you have sensitive skin, and can't take having your state  mentioned in jest don't buy this book.	2000-05-01

There is no other text which covers the full I/O Streams library as of the ISO C++99 standard. B. Stroustrup's book &quot;The C++ Programming language&quot; has one chapter of 50+ pages on streams. Its  enough to get you started, but not enough if you want to make roll your  own. Your other choice is to comb back issues of C++ Report and C/C++  User's Journal for the relevent information. (And know enough to ignore the  articles that do it wrong. Ok maybe wrong is too strong a word, but now  that you have the option to understand how the streams library is built you  can use it the way it was intended.)<br />There is now no reason ANY  programmer should create a new ostream class by inheriting from  basic_ostream&lt;&gt;. The I/O streams library was designed to be extended  by programmers. Read this book and learn how to do it so that you don't  have to re-write every sub member as a forward to the actual class.<br />As  for Locales, there is a chapter in the latest version of B.S's book as an  Appendix. Or about 1/4th of this book is devoted to how that mechanism  works.<br />Buy it. You need it. Without it you are programming by guess and  by golly.	2000-05-01
US	52693154	ROPZVAM7797L1	0689832117	9483240	Eloise in Moscow	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Lite history of the Cold War	My girls and I love the Eloise series, this one included. The age group to understand this book is a bit older than the others, say 11 or 12. All the cold war references led to interesting discussions of the cold war and the  failure of Communism.<br />On the light side this book reads very well out  loud. It helps if you have a deep voice to say as the intra tourist guide  &quot;IS POSSIBLE TO SEE BOOK REVIEWS HERE.&quot; &quot;IS NOT POSSIBLE TO  HOLD BOOKS, BOOKS ARE SENT AFTER BOUGHT&quot; (While not a quote from the  book, it reads like it.)<br />The book's view of the world does feel dated.  It's like reading a Cowboys vs Indian's book and having to explain that  perhaps not all is as it appears.  Russia is not what it was, but it's not  the west yet.<br />The quality of the paper and the binding are excellent, it  feels like it will last for multiple reading. There is a nice foldout of  the Kremlin. Like all the Eloise books, the drawings are inked in one  color, this one uses yellow to great effect. The paper jacket is an exact  copy of the hard cover underneath which is great as the text on it is  wonderful.<br />If you like the other Eloise books, you'll like this one.	2000-02-28

But the dark side of this book is that this poor rich child is neglected by her mother and her father is never mentioned. Is he merely a dead beat dad or dead? Eliose doesn't seem to care. Perhaps her acting out with inappropriate behaviour is merely a way of expressing her anger at the neglect by her parents? Her drawing on her walls a deep cry for help?<br />Nah! Of course that's all 90's psycho-babble. This book was written in the 50's when no one thought twice about giving the care of children to hired help. Eliose of course rebels and seeks attention and even us involved parents see these antics. A quick trip to Paris will solve all your problems. There is nothing like fishing in the river, visiting museums or a picnic in the park to make one's cares go away.<br />My kids loved it.	1999-05-10

If I'd been born at the turn of the 1900 century and read this book I'd have thrown away my life to go to sea.  It has an actual account of a whaler who was swallowed by a whale, then rescued from its stomach when the crew cut it up.<br /><br />  Its has a story about sailors stuck inside a sinking boat, which, when the cargo disolved refloated and were rescued.<br /><br />  For all you armchair sailors and lovers of Patric O'Briens stuff, You'll love it.	1998-02-04
