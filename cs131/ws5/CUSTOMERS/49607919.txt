I found other gender related books to be very limiting,which  lead me to take some tests on spatial and verbal ability,let's just say,under the narrow Brain Sex mode,I would have a  completely male brain in a female body!..after my test,my  suspicions increased and I did some further reading and found this book. The writer explains how researchers may not be entirely ojective, how you cannot in any way base all gender behavior on a limited amount of subjects,since we of course have over a billion persons roaming the planet with many different individual  abilites,and how there is an agenda against women's advancement in science and math,which of course demand sound logic and  spatial reasoning. Expand your possibities,get the gender limits off your minds, and soar!	2000-09-27

We get reincarnation from the Hindus and Buddist  and while we should respect those religions we  need to get a good look at  how this book is based on just more philosophy and what MAY happen and not  about what may REALLY happen after death.<br />The truth is,would I make much  money if I were a medium and did NOT believe in reincarnation?  Probably  not,because reincarnation is a cultural fad at present and the mediums who  believe in it are more in favor of the public than I would be  in,because  of my lack of belief in reincarnation the public would not favor my advice  and probably not buy any of my books.<br />Plus I saw a post on this site  about a person  who's sister died and they are sad that their  sister may  be floating around in white light doing nothing,,that would leave me  concerned as well, because we all need to be active and learning  no matter  on what side of life we may be in.

If you enjoy anthropological and biological  theories in trying to explain female/feminine  behaviors,then this book is for you.But if you are looking for what I'd call a psychic/psychological awakening read or listen to  &quot;Wishing Well&quot; this  will expand your mind way beyond the  artificalised limits of gender and inspire you to start seeing yourself as  a soul,it will teach you that thoughts are things and you can make it  happen.<br />I think way too many books,which as What's Holding You Back? use  questionable and controversal theories for gender differences which make it  seem as though there is no middle ground, no individuality,male this way  and female another. I get very tired of hearing in self help books how  women can use their greater intuition,people oriented skills and verbal  skills when in my case and some other,this does not apply to us.What help  is anything which makes assumptions of its readers without realizing not  all of a certain group/gender has the same abilities to begin with.  Personally I enjoy reading books that open the boundaries not close one up  with sentences such as &quot;the male hormone testorstone makes boys more   prone to taking risks&quot; doesn't that just make girls seem a bit  defective,poor me I wasn't born with enough testostrone,but maybe I was  because as a young child I was very much the tomboy til my  wicked ways  caught up with me one day and I was  told to &quot;be a lady&quot; those  words put such boundaries on me that not til recently did I no  longer care  what others though but decided to  draw on my inner tomboy for full self  awareness. Try books that are for both genders,maybe more  focused on  energy and thought than biology and  anthropolical explainations.<br />We  don't need wordy and somewhat suspicious  theories to explain the behaviors  we are trying to escape from ..what we really need is inspiration to  fullfill dreams and make them come true.	2000-04-30
