Much to one's dismay, one finds a whole parade of grief counseling peddlers. Garden variety touchy-feely advice. Precious little for people with brain cells in the right places.<br /><br />That is what makes this Kubler-Ross compilation an absolute treasure of a find. It is intelligent in its narrative of moments one goes through at times of deep sudden loss, and the kinds of things one can do or think to ride the emotional rollercoasters that inevitably ensue. The prose is sane, easy to identity with. There is a rich cornucopia of examples and real life experiences that go to great lengths to cushion the self-doubt one could quite easily feel while indulging in a book on the subject.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this muddle-through read highly enough. A smart, sensitive companion. Look for the paperback if possible, there is one. As you are reading this review, may I also offer to point out that life's curveballs may appear random at times, with very little explanations offered for unpleasant things one has to live through, but life goes on. You will get through it. Best wishes.	2005-10-08

Readers of Lee Child already know this, but to those just discovering him let me start with a warning: don't pick up a Lee Child novel if you have other things to do. He'll blow you away, you'll spend hours turning pages wondering where your daily dose of sleep went.<br /><br />Such a sheer delight to discover a writer one just can't get enough of. After John Grisham, Harlan Coben, Janet Evanovich, he is the first I've come across who smooshes all the punch you can expect from riveting thrillers -- tight plots, punchy dialogue, wry intelligent humor, solid pace devoid of irrelevant digressions, and above all, endearing characters.<br /><br />I'm not much into military yarns (Tom Clancy's tomes are hardly my bag) but The Enemy does a superlative job of keeping it accessible. It fires off with a two-star army general found dead on New Year's eve. Simple misfortune it seems, cardiac arrest in a compromising position, but police procedure reveals his wife clobbered to death and a couple of grotesque murders that seem loosely connected. To fan the flame, the army's upper echelons want it all hushed up.<br /><br />The political/forensic drama that follows is impeccably timed. Had me awake for nights. The twists are unpredictable. Child does an outstanding job of getting into the mind of our detective protagonist - Jack Reacher, to the extent that we solve the crime along with him.<br /><br />More than the plot and its twists, I'm impressed with Child's economy of language, yet the ease with which he paints his vivid setups. If this were to inspire a movie the screenplay would pretty much write itself.<br /><br />Looking for a mystery fix? Get The Enemy, or among others by the same author, One Shot or Persuader. Truly satisfying reads all and highly, highly recommended. I bet you'll be buying the next Lee Child novel before you're done with your first.	2005-09-06

Stack yet another wannabe novel on that big pile with a swashbuckling terrorist wanting to blow up big cities. It's heartening to see others underwhelmed with this vapid 'thriller' because I quite frankly don't understand why Patterson bothered beyond the first three Alex Cross novels.<br /><br />His writing has only gotten more pedestrian, his plots more bromidic, fresh from the read-along-and-dont-ask-questions school of action writing. Quick 3-page chapters seem set up for pace but muddle the flow instead, there isn't a smidge of build-up.<br /><br />Twenty pages into this tripe I was all but ready to smack the addle-pat reviewers at Publishers Weekly who glowed with odes like \\"Best of Patterson's work!\\" Well, that it isn't.<br /><br />In mood for a well-oiled thriller?

Books	2	24	25	N	N	TO BE READ WITH GREAT CAUTION	The book is a bestseller because it plays on the common sentiment that cash-generating capital assets make for safer long term bets than debt-inducing ones. To dumb it down: buy a house while you skip that latest Lexus or Plasma telly. Assets good, liabilities bad.<br /><br />Simple and perfectly predictable idea, but while we're making a book of it, why not weave a thicket of redundant text including choice comments such as this, I quote:<br /><br />\\"Put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets. Soon your asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments that have returns of 100 percent to infinity. Investments that for $5000 are soon turned into $1 million and more.\\"<br /><br />To the extent that Kiyosaki's definition of 'wealth' represents the ability to cover living expenses with passive income, there is merit to the idea of investing in cash generating assets. But it is hard not to question advice from an author who, before this supposed one-trick real estate panacea, used to advise people to pile their coin into Nasqaq IPOs.<br /><br />He makes it sound like a cakewalk. Actionable advice is conspicuous by its absence, except perhaps for a suggestion nearly 150 pages into the ordeal: build your own small cap stock company and enjoy the superior returns as the inside investor.<br /><br />If only it were that simple.<br /><br />This being a review perhaps it must be added that the writing is annoyingly hokey, full of his supposedly middle class Hawaiian dad who led a conservative life while doting on a fictitious uncle who had it rolling thanks to his ingenious investment strategies. Not that this matters, but this has since been debunked, this father and this uncle were concocted purely for the book (ref: Smart Money).<br /><br />If you're truly considering some responsible reading, may I suggest a few books that will make their level-headed points without tripping over shiny financial mumbo-jumbo:<br /><br />1. The Richest Man in Babylon (George Clayson)<br />2. Your Money or Your Life (Joe Dominguez)<br />3.

Wags may discourage the practice of judging a book by its cover, but I've found my best reads in precisely that manner. This little gamble from Chris Stewart claimed to be about a man moving to the country and going 'back to basics,' so I picked it up for some transatlantic in-flight diversion. Hippitty hotdamn, did it pay off handsomely!<br /><br />A man of city in a fairly plush life decides to hoist it off to the southern Andalusian countryside. This is his story of setting up tent in a pastoral setting -- haggling with local landlords, the ensuing altercations with his wife back in the comfort of the civilized world, building a house and a small farm from straw and chicken wire, and so forth.<br /><br />This is non-fiction, mind you. It's a narrative of Stewart's actual life, a memoir of sorts. His writing is taut and witty. His eccentric reminiscences of adapting to a new habitat are charming. Take it for a spin if you're looking for a part travelogue part amusing take on things that make life worth living. Fascinating read!	2005-03-27

So you've read this is Grisham's return to legal thrillers after inexplicable diversions like Bleachers. Hate to tell you - it's anything but.<br /><br />We shoot off the docks with grand Hollywood-style razzmatazz involving the CIA, the president of United States, and the dubious pardon of a certain high-stakes deal agent sent to Europe as a sitting duck for assassins to get him. Makes you buckle up for some breathless action.<br /><br />Then just a few dozen pages later this whole sensational setup goes thud as our protagonist (and Grisham) get smitten with Italiana. We take long languid walks through Bologna's porticoed sidewalks and piazzas. Read ornate descriptions of the city's basilicas, towers, frescoes, marble crypts. There's even time to learn the legend surrounding the naked bronze statue of the Roman god Neptune at the Fontana del Nettuno from the 1500s.<br /><br />Our little broker is savoring the food, the language, the history. Problem is, we're not because nothing's happening.<br /><br />As a storyteller Grisham is in full bloom, which would've been super if only he had a story to tell. Recommended for italophiles, rest of us should seek our thrills elsewhere.	2005-02-18

It's tough not to be skeptical of such health advice passed on with the vainglory of an entire culture in the backing.<br /><br />Let's face it.

Do NSA agents use password-free screensavers or a five digit password for a supercomputer? Who knows. May be they put a lot of trust in their hardware infrastructural security. No trivialities of this sort make the story any less thrilling.<br /><br />The crypto theme and the lengths to which a national security organization is willing to go is thought-provoking if nothing else. Had me wondering if all this loss of privacy and violation of human rights is justified by the number of all the devious terrorist plots foiled and lives spared daily. An intriguing dilemma.<br /><br />Above all else I'm beginning to have a great deal of respect for Brown's research caliber. Some technological sections sound so frighteningly plausible it's hard to believe they came from a small town English teacher. He makes sure he adds some ribbing academic humour into his lead character, surely a reflection of his own real life.<br /><br />Sure a lot of things fall in place for the global espionage angle to work, but if a bit of technology doesn't intimidate you (all well explained anyway) I recommend this enthralling thriller in a blink.	2005-02-01

Anyone who has read the novel until its denouement will know that this is simply incorrect. The script never equates legitimate anger at the duplicity and dishonesty of the Bush administration with assassination, the whole \\"plot\\" of our crazed protagonist is meant to come across as silly as our second character so laboriously keeps grinding at.<br /><br />That cleared, this scamming little novella may not sport the sparkling prose of a typical Baker tome but it offers a delectable flavour in its own right.<br /><br />The text is in its entirety a dinner-table conversation between two friends, one a fanatic opponent of Bush's invasion of Iraq and thus contemplating killing the president with a giant rolling ball (and other contraptions like it, let's not dwell on trivia that're to be savoured in Baker's customary bizzare prose), and the other a wiser, more balanced sort attempting to dissuade his friend with murderous tendencies.<br /><br />With this scaffolding, Baker presents not only some very interesting trivia such as an updated version of Napalm being allegedly employed in Iraq despite all claims to the contrary (apparently because the formula is technically different; more lethal now) but also some very opinionated insights into the heart of the matter.<br /><br />Barring the somewhat twisted inference that our assassin-wannabe draws from his indignations, or the odd out-of-place rant on evils of abortion and such, this is quite a clever little conversation that shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to devour from cover to cover.<br /><br />I'd recommend it in a blink.	2004-10-11

The book's poignancy as well as it eroticism are brought to life through a larger-than-life comic filter of a man who believes his \\"charisma has yet to fully bloom\\" but who still has issues with Euclidean constructs and social solitude. The undercurrent of romance is fabulous.<br /><br />Things resolve neatly and a bit too quickly in the end (a very lean novella), but for as long as it does last it's a well-paced comic diversion with some very witty insights into life and love.

This is the first time I've read Frayn, but his high-tea civilised comic intelligence is reminiscent of P.G. Wodehouse. The wit that encases Headlong is not in the laugh-out-loud, satirically savage league of Sedaris or Rakoff, but it manages to hold its own in the bittersweet and ironic department.<br />Plotwise, there isn't exactly too much adipose. Our urban protagonist, a philosophy lecturer with an interest in art history, camps up in his country cottage to cope with a writer's block, meets a rich but rural landowner and his younger wife (bundles of urban-rural barbs), finds at their house what we are led to believe is a collector's item unbeknownst to the landowner, and sets out on a frantic process of discovery to authenticate this potentially pricey work of art and steal it from his host. Troubles ensue. The wife of the landowner is enlisted as an accomplice in the grand heist plan. Oodles of action, clinched by a chase sequence at the end.<br />While not something I'd read again (I am told Frayn's &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is better) Headlong is certainly a pleasant book that chugs along with a genial step. Very decent light-reading material to accompany you on a lazy Sunday afternoon.	2004-07-19

And I thought that &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; was Rohinton's best! Yet again, I find myself speechless in my admiration for his astute command of language. His  precise and inventive prose never quits until he has portrayed an image in sentences. Images that I grew up with myself but never quite would have thought of expressing in the grippingly sensitive way he can.<br />Swimming Lessons is a collection of such reminiscences from the author's childhood in a Parsi neighborhood in suburban middle-class Bombay. The setting itself may be confined to a particular community, but his compassionate brush carves such a wide sweep of the minutest of human emotions that the sheer force of this book is not in its plot or setting, but in its recognition of the universal bounty of life.<br />Our quirky residents of 'Firozsha Baag' have every reason to be disconcerted and baffled with their difficult lives. The walls of their building complex are coming apart. Washroom flushes don't work. One family has the refrigerator that's shared by the entire colony, and another has the common telephone. Their lives are marred by simple everyday things, innocent infatuations, unconfessed fantasies, fatal jealousies, neighborhood bullies, petty thefts, memory lapses, shared newspapers, cultural/generational clashes, etc etc.<br />Yet, beneath this veneer of this seeming hardships glimmers a subtle undercurrent of hope and happiness, of a bond that does not need expressing in the common social forms.<br />The high praise that Mistry has garnered is not exaggerated. The man has a disarming sense of humor and a lingering sense of what makes literature  great. I laughed, I cried, I sat back and pondered. I was especially stirred by the moving story &quot;Of White Hairs and Cricket&quot;, and the cover story, which is saved for the last, &quot;Swimming Pools.&quot;<br />Couldn't recommend this brilliant compilation highly enough. It hardly reads like a debut.	2004-07-19

But having his quirky, self-effacing romantic gems in English is a delight of a different order altogether. The translation is thankfully quite interesting in and of itself which lends this book an amusing, page-turning quality.<br />Couple of notes:<br />(1) Get the Ecco Press version if you can find it, the paper quality is less annoying. The Amazon site (this page) advertises a publication from &quot;Rupa Co.&quot; which has crummy pages that I regret buying.<br />(2) Also, the Ecco Press version of the book contains interesting translation notes from Sunil Dutta, which are fun to read. Robert Bly is listed as the editor, and while he hogs the credit, he simply performed the role of revising and redecorating Dutta's copious translation notes.<br />Either way, I highly recommend this thin volume for people who appreciate poetry in general or &quot;shayari&quot; in particular. I'd gladly pay for more than 30 samples of Ghalib's prolific work.	2004-07-17

Fifty pages into this ramble and I recognized that the magnanimous length (960-odd pages) of this biographical tome has little to do with the unsparing capturing of valuable historical perspective, and more to do with Mr. Clinton's vainglorious and thus frequently dull ruminations. Wonder if such lack of discipline is reflective of the ex-president's general style in the White House but this lumber seems fated to decorate my shelves for a while. Sorry for not providing any constructive review of the contents as it would take a lot to get to that bit, but I presume it is in there somewhere.	2004-07-12

I believe it is a proverb of the African bushmen, &quot;A story is like the wind, it comes from a far-off quarter, and we feel it.&quot;<br />Those words were invented to describe this stirring gem from Baricco.<br />His prose feels much like a light autumn breeze, soft yet wondrously mermerizing. With ballad-like refrains and sublime descriptions of the harmonious way of Japanese life, we are drawn into an evocative portrait of what it means to be human, at our most elemental, and the effect is awesome.<br />The hypnotic curiosity of a distant unrequited love leads the novel to its stark and tempestuos end, which lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page in bewilderment.<br />I have never read such an effortlessly haunting saga of compassion, obsession, intrigue. Kudos to the translator for retaining Baricco's original Italian delicacy.<br />It takes about 2 hours to journey between the novel's shores, but I bet you'll take the voyage more than once.	2004-07-11

If you don't provide access from every one of your users' desktops, you'll be gone.  I find this a bit hard to digest as a categorical generalization, and I am a net evangelist myself. But I would not have expected anything different from Dell.<br />Secondly, the tone of the author(s?) occasionally takes on a doting note, and they seem to imply that Dell veritably invented the direct selling approach. This is patently misguided. A corollary that stems from this is the novel way that Dell came up with to segment customers. Somewhat cloying, this self-absorption.<br />Yet, in terms of good business insights, it's a fascinating read good enough to be devoured in a day or two. Recommended, especially as a business gift.	2004-06-26

Indeed that wouldn't be possible because our little sleuth in this case is someone suffering from Asperger's syndrome.<br />We are instead presented with the world, the &quot;case&quot;, the life from his point of view. And this is the marvellous aspect of the book because the simple yet clever perspectives are riveting.<br />For instance, the boy does not believe metaphors. Metaphors are a way of talking about things in a way that they aren't, so metaphors are basically lies -- you laughed your socks off, it's raining cats and dogs, you are the apple of my eye. Can an apple fit into an eye? At the heart of Christopher's predicament is betrayal. His mother leaves his father. His father betrays him. He simply says, &quot;Why can't you love me? Why can't you be straight?&quot;<br />One one level, our little detective is mentally challenged but on another he is a terrific observer. His dislike for lies about the events he is recounting and his aversion to emotionalizing his observations lend the story a stripped-down precision that enables the author to talk about the big issues of love, mortality, loss, betrayal without sounding contrived.<br />What a brilliant debut from Mark Haddon. I feared I would be treading on a tripwire of sympathy-bombs when I bought the book, but it's a moving, fast-paced read with a very intriguing &quot;plot&quot; that is not burdened by finding proofs and criminals, but by tossing up the absurdities and lies of our lives.<br />Highly recommended, for almost anyone in your family who can read.	2004-06-23

His case studies range from Chile to the Philippines and make a lot of sense.

Along the way I've picked up several religions and spiritual books of all stripes that advocate the benefits of meditation, silence, and retreats as ways to heal the body, mind, and soul.<br />But Honore's well researched treatise provides what I believe is the first incisive overview of an important cultural phenomenon as we immerse our lives in instant online messengers, SMS thumb tribes, skipped breakfast, limp chicken sandwiches for lunch, and a bout of 'power yoga' to punctuate that little crevice of a break in the evenings..<br />Honore's writing style may occasionally wear a &quot;Manifesto&quot; dress and many of his suggestions to live a slow life may have a fairly non-trivial opportunity cost depending on where you live, but it is a very timely and wonderfully thought-provoking read nonetheless.	2004-06-16

Happened to pick up and browse through this paperweight at the airport and patted myself for not having bought it.<br />For one thing, in Carr’s world, information technology managers are fools that drain dollars to the tune of 2 trillion every year, slavishly upgrading to whatever new thing vendors want to sell. This is a VERY narrow definition of organizational &quot;IT&quot;. The world of technology is much wider and ever-expanding, making a direct or indirect impact into our daily lives, both personal and commercial. So the scope of this book is a bit hog-tied.<br />For another, these petty cavils are not new. Paul Strassman (Paul Strassman Inc.) has been saying the same things for a while. Morgan Stanley's star analyst Stephen Roach broke into the same bungled song and dance in the early 90s. Even more recently, &quot;the bubble burst, I told you&quot; has been recently toted as the safely wise justification. One could think of the many financial bubbles that have burst to disastrous consequences, but that's for another day.<br />Is IT unproductive? If the answer to that is yes (which it is not) then there are two possible explanations. That IT investments are ineffective (the author's take) or that we're not measuring productivity right. Nobel laureate MIT professor Robert Solow, with his work on &quot;productivity paradox&quot;, has proven that the latter may be just as true as the ineffectiveness of tech spending.<br />Come to think of it, consider this:<br />- Without IT, the author would not have the website that promotes this hackneyed refrain.<br />- Nor would we have the Amazon.com website which allows hundreds of readers to commit the mistake of spending money on his book.<br />- Or on its PDF ebook version.<br />- IT was used in the the typesetting of this very book.<br />- IT is used by his publisher to manage all their accounts, including the royalties the author will get.<br />- IT is used to power almost every record in the university and the office that pays the author his monthly salary (Harvard)<br />- It is IT in the car that he drives to work that parks automatically or that aids his navigation<br />- ...and so on...<br />Overall, the book didn't catch my attention for more than 15 minutes.

But when I re-read the book now, it touches my heart and soul.<br />The book's southern American characters lead simple, seemingly joyless lives. Their hopes and ambitions are stymied by circumstances and human foibles, mostly of their own making. It is a very laid back novel, despite occasional spurts of violence.<br />But it is McCullers' fluent prose that makes this book absolutely worth the ride, as does the wide sweep of thoughts and emotions covered in the book --- our struggle against isolation, religion as self-delusion, valorm, our search for connection and redemption, society's repression of the individual.<br />It is not the most cheerful of novels, but will definitely strike a clangy chord with people who enjoy solitude but also know its pitfalls.	2004-05-27

The narrator's first person voice is fascinating and indelibly colored by her own losses and unanswerable questions. Also narrating the story, by turns, are her four sharply observant daughters, each of whom must strike her own separate path to salvation, a path paved with moral risk and personal responsibility.<br />For its audacity in setting up a fascinating literary scaffolding (with the intertwined narratives) or for its politically charged backdrop, or for the sheer worldly wisdom packed within its many pages, The Poisonwood Bible offers twin pleasures of being a dark comedy of human failings as well as the breathtaking possibilities of human hope.<br />I couldn't recommend this book highly enough.	2004-05-26

My first read of this book a few years ago had left me with the impression that it made for a sordid case of existential disenchantment.<br />Camus to me was the hero of life's pointlessness, the murky messenger of resistance and its impossibility, the contemporary writer who proved that life was a plague and its victims were condemned to an endless cycle of futile revolt.<br />On the second read, however, the book is nowhere near as despondent as I recall it. Far from it.<br />It is about courage, about engagement, about paltriness and generosity, about small heroism and large cowardice, and about all kinds of profoundly humanist problems, such as love and goodness, happiness and mutual connection. It weaves a complex hope offered by resistance and the urgency of understanding the long, deep reach of war's corrupting power.<br />A very, very satisfying and thought provoking read.	2004-05-25

Laughable Loves makes for a brilliant pocket edition of Kundera: bitsized chunks of surreal yet less complex stories that, in a typically Kundera manner, are delectably introspective yet comic.<br />Kundera is one of the handful of authors who so can smoothly shift the reader from mundane concerns into latent madness as to almost challenge one's faith in the material world. His world is spare, unadorned, almost like a room that needs to be furnished by our own mind. Games, dreams and schemes abound in all these little stories as different characters react in different ways to romantic impulses.<br />Part preposterous, part enchanting, but never for a moment boring. I highly recommended this volume of laughable loves that will leave you thinking long after your grins have turned in for the night.	2004-05-25

Very few people are interested and it kills the frog.<br />Regardless of what you think of Ayn Rand's then breakthrough ideas of capitalism, selfishness, etc., you must pick up this indubitable powerhouse of a novel.<br />The protagonist, Howard Roark, is quite conveniently a total orphan with no social moorings or responsibilities. This allows the author a great deal of liberty in weaving philosophical tropes around him.<br />The presentation of the ideas though is simply delicious, couched in some riveting writing, and will keep your thought mills running for a good while.

Picked this up on a whim at an airport, seeing the glittering reviews on the book's cover from big tyke publications (NYT, LA Times, Publisher's Weekly). They said this travelogue to India was &quot;funny, very funny&quot; or &quot;hilarious&quot;, yada yada.<br />Sadly, the book is not only extremely unfunny, it also is an idiotic novel. Chapters after chapters brim with juvenile attempts at humor, cuss words and all.<br />The theme is grounded on discovering India with a supposedly foreign eye, which could have made for a great pretext for some intelligent cultural barbs (and they can be quite funny, India lends itself to quite a bit of ethnic humor), but it is just plain uninteresting. For instance,  Indian-isms such as &quot;curd&quot; (yoghurt) are described in painfully unfunny style between the novel's main protagonists.<br />One wonders what so many reviewers have found entertaining about this bland travelogue.

This follow-up cookbook is being marketed as if it were looking to dovetail on the popularity of its predecessor, but I believe if you have this, you don't even need the original.<br />The variety of recipes is fascinating, and the diet phase they correspond to in the original diet (which you can easily comprehend from this book alone) is clearly marked.<br />Mind you, this is not a &quot;low carb&quot; book. It is about lowering &quot;bad&quot; carbs while allowing &quot;good&quot; carbs. The South Beach idea veers around keeping the Glycemic Index low and Agatston does a pretty good job of explaining the nutritional logic for doing so.<br />The recipes that I have tried so far are quite good in terms of taste. The best thing for me is that none of the recipes includes any fancy condiments that you'd only find in some super-elite department stores on the other side of town.

I guess I should be fairly glad that I bought this book before reading the reviews here on Amazon, because most reviews about this expansive thoughtpiece seems to veer around the issue of whether Emmott is right about China or not.<br />The book in fact covers a lot more ground, which could be a good thing (I enjoyed the breadth) or bad (it flip-flops around too many issues, readers who are looking for a definitive opinion on the Big Economic Questions may be underwhelmed.)<br />While I will admit that this is not as insightful as some of Bill's previous attempts (e.g., his super-accurate analyses of Japan) it book does move from theme to theme rather effortlessly and manages to pull off discourses on an impressive range of subjects, time periods and perspectives. For instance:<br />(1) JAPAN: The increasing cracks; how it may need to get more nationalistic; how it may need to to accumulate more military might to counter Pyounyang;or to reinvent itself once again to compete with quickly rising Asian neighbors; etc.<br />(2) CAPITALISM: A fascinating examination of objections to capitalism, which is thought to be Unpopular, Unstable and Unequal. I found this section to be somewhat weak. While the &quot;American model&quot; has pros, it also has cons, and to advocate it as THE model for the entire world to emulate is somewhat panglossian. (Come to think of it, America itself now has differing factions on this question, but we don't see that in this book).<br />(3) GLOBALIZATION: We get a healthy dose of how the conventional criticism of globalization is inspired by over-sentimentalism or just plain bad data. It's an interesting read though I'd still keep my &quot;Globalization and its Discontents&quot; handy.<br />(4) TERRORISM: Again, some interesting thoughts and predictions. For instance, Osama and Al Qaeda will be busted. We skimp on discussions of the key drivers of Islamic terrorism, or what American (and the world) needs to do to counter these goings-on.<br />...etc...<br />Long and short of it, if you are looking for highly insightful or fresh commentary, you may be somewhat disappointed. But if, like me, you like to sit back with material that eggs you on to think and ponder about the mushy labyrinth of politics and economics, you'll find 20:21 a very satisfying and enjoyable read.

If you're looking for that perfect in-transit book to skim through, without straining your shoulders but working your grey matter, this slim treatise (115 pages, double spaced) makes for a pretty good fit.<br />Simply put, it draws some very thoughtful life and business lessons from Chess. Don't worry, it includes just enough chess material to keep the book relevant to the strategic game, but not so egregiously that it puts off people unfamiliar with chess (you know what a rook is though, right?)<br />The author writes almost like a chess player: with concentration and quick, quiet decisions expressed in single sentences. Which makes this book not only a pretty neat source of business thoughts, but also one of the better self-help and self-improvement books I've ever read.<br />You'll end up with a fistful of aphorisms if you really read, and while it may look a bit steep for its slim size, it's absolutely worth it.

Apart from the break-neck pace, I love the way Patterson squeezes in contemporary facts and events in his thrillers.<br />This latest in the Women's Murder Club series is every bit as nailbiting as the first two, but with a slight twist: this time, the solution to a grisly string of bombings cannot come without the expense of having to lose someone very close to our amateur detectives.<br />Riveting plot twists. Bullet paced turn of events. This novel packs in just about everything you would expect from a wholesome crime thriller. If you've read the first 2 in the series, you'd probably be even better off as you could relate more easily to the fears and idiosyncrasies of our intriguing protagonists.<br />So feed the cat, turn on the air conditioning and slip into bed with this very, very satisfying nailbiter.	2004-04-18

Good news is, you won't miss much even if you skim past such sections (only a few of them.)<br />(3) The book admittedly drags a little at the end.<br />That said, I have to confess that this brilliant long-story debut from Martel is a tour-de-force in contemporary fiction. Apart from his extraordinary command of language -- imagine a full-fledged novel without any discernible plot that still manages to grab you by the scruff of your neck for 300 odd pages -- the situations that his narrative veers around are both original and whacky, so you can expect frequent traces of restrained but intelligent humor, and almost a persistent undercurrent of themes that evoke ruminations.<br />But the thing that shines above all are its lovable characters, who are suffused with such neotenous wonder that reading about them is a fresh experience, a sparkling look at our habitual assumptions about religion, about zoos and the wilderness, about the ambiguous bounds of freedom, or even about -- gulp! -- God.<br />Almost anyone with a heart and a flair for thought can savour this novel. Do yourself a favor and get a piece of this Pi. Or share it with someone you love, it'd make for a very thoughtful gift..	2004-04-15

READ IT FOR THE CASE STUDIES.	It is difficult to review a book that one has enjoyed reading and then say that it was not up to the mark (in terms, of course, of only my expectations.)<br />No doubt that Scott Bedbury's work is a fast paced read, his writing is lucid and quite frequently quotably light-hearted. There is a lot of material here for people in larger corporations or even general marketing folks. And where Bedbury truly shines is in the case studies he presents in the 8 chapters.<br />But if, like me, you set off on this book looking for some newfangled insights into the world of branding, then this is not the book for you. The title claims to proffer &quot;8 principles&quot;. Let's face it, at the end of the day, principles are not that hard to create and this becomes quite painfully clear when you reach the end of this book and wonder if you have learnt anything new.<br />But I am being unfairly critical. From his style, it seems an approachable business book was precisely what Bedbury's intended?<br />As a comprehensive introduction to the field of branding, I'd still recommend &quot;Strategic Brand Asset Management&quot; by Keller. For a discussion of some innovative yet reasonable forms of brand creation, especially on a shoestring, I'd usually point to a PR related book, or perhaps the rapier wit &quot;60-minutes Brand Strategist.&quot;<br />But as a gentle introduction for executives in to the nebulous world of branding, or as a non-technical business book for business folk in general who place less emphasis on a structured analytical framework and are more interested in a soft springboard into the field, then &quot;Emotional Branding&quot; and this book from Bedbury are pretty near the top of my list of recommendations.<br />Very accessible and insightful stuff, if you aren't expecting a summary of last decade's JCR.	2004-04-14

After a young artist's husband commits suicide, she resumes her life only to one day discover a strange person sitting on a bed in an unused room, an otherworldly man-child who speaks in cryptic utterances that lack context and syntax. She assumes that he suffers from autism and plans to notify authorities; but changes her mind after hearing him repeat, word for word, a conversation she had with her husband on the day of his death. Wow.<br />Who is this quaint stranger -- unwilling time traveler? Is our protagonist no more than a desperate woman whose grief and isolation have made her delusional? At first I was somewhat frustrated by these questions, but found myself haunted by the layered meanings.<br />When it was not the prose that had me thinking, I was smitten with DeLillo's fascinatingly poetic writing style. He weaves such a riveting tapestry of words to delve into the emotional minutiae of his characters that he not only captivates our sympathetic attention he has us thinking like we were the ones he was talking about.<br />I highly recommend this effortlessly engrossing tale if you have a taste for offbeat but thought-provoking literature.	2004-04-10

He hammers home the drudgery of business cliches in an absolutely hilariously anti-establishment satire. It's an easy to read compilation, you could devour it in a couple of hours if you wish (and you mostly likely will).<br />The title itself is a funny play on &quot;Who moved my cheese&quot;, a monumentally boring bestseller from a few years ago about change management. As one of the reviews suggests, change is something a lot of disillusioned CEOs like Martha Stewart have to cope with in their newfound abodes.<br />Pick up this gem for some pure, unadulterated, and occasionally even laught-out-loud humor.

Discovered that this is a debut, and it's quite an impressive one! The story is grounded in the Canadian construction industry, which may at first make you expect very few thrills 'n chills, but McAdam's prose is brash, ribald and bursts with energy. Even a relatively wry plot about a family's misfortunes and disintegration thereof is lent some readibaility by a clever denouement that weaves in the conflicting ambitions of two very different men. Quite a worthy read, but I would also consider buying a used copy.	2004-03-31

No introduction necessary for 37S, I am a near-cultic reader of the &quot;Design Not Found&quot; (DNF) endeavour and of the &quot;Signal vs. Noise&quot; (SvN) blog. But upon reading the flyer for this book I wondered if I'd find something in it that's not already on these two sites. Unfortunately, the answer is somewhat mixed.<br />PEOPLE WHO MAY FIND THIS BOOK USEFUL:<br />(1) Those who don't have the time or the energy to voraciously follow the posts on SvN or the additions to DNF.<br />(2) Site Managers who need a guideline or checklist of things they would do well to cover off.<br />(3) Project Managers making a case for that common-sense stuff that's usually skirted amidst all those Yesterday deadlines.<br />(4) Cultic fans of 37 Signals<br />(5) Those who like Interstate typography :)<br />(6) Those who don't really care for actual implementation, but are looking simply for some cursory ideas and examples. For instance, in giving examples of good 404 pages (aren't we kinda late to the party if we need a book such as this to get educated on the MOST fundamental element of a website?) we are never really told how these pages can be implemented. We instead get 7 pages of what the authors believe are good case studies. Fair enough.<br />PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DISAPPOINTED:<br /><br />(1) Web Developers in the know. I mean, do I really need a half page discourse on the scourge of the RESET button (which no one uses) or a whole page on why I should disable the SUBMIT button once it has been pressed by a user, etc etc?<br />(2) Those who believe that nearly twenty dollars could get you a whole array of other cool things.<br />SUMMARY:<br />It's an extended and neatly bound version of DNF with a New Riders stamp, and only you're the judge of what that could mean to you. Great stuff, very well presented in the customary 37S elegant minimalistic design, but it would be difficult to make a case for why this is a must-own item for webbies in-the-know.	2004-03-31

It nearly makes one wish that there was someone a bit more hip and compelling than the author of this book standing up for this simple hardhitting truth, because the point is compelling.

I know a bit about Johnson as a formidable raconteur of the Japanese post-war political economy and more recently from his study of the unintended consequences of America's overseas military and political adventures called &quot;Blowback&quot;, published before 911, which was, needless to say, prescient!<br />Like Chomsky, Johnson attempts to create a context by bringing out a sprawling spectrum of recent American policies, which he contends are all  calculated to maximize the influence + profits that US seeks abroad.<br />But it is the focus that sets this thesis apart. Johnson focuses more on Asia, particularly Central Asia, and his gaze is more firmly on the Bush regime and its oil/energy interests in Central Asia that hold sway in foreign policy decision making.<br />While a good deal of the book is filled with the typical rhetoric of the American Dream being increasingly  being subordinated to the demands of war, we are offered interesting examples, which I have not heard before, e.g., Masirah Island, Kyrgyzstan, Kosovo, Uzbekistan and Ramstein. There are many interesting facts and observations, e.g., US has 725 bases in 120 countries.<br />U.S. history has many sides. As Johnson convincingly demonstrates, US has committed blatant acts of imperial domination and exploitation. Yet in the aftermath of Vietnam, or the IndoChina involvement as recently as 40 years ago, Americans came to believe that the war provided the irrefutable lesson of the limits of U.S. power.<br />But now a determined group of policymakers has induced amnesia on the subject. It doesn't acknowledge limits to U.S. power. President Bush has rightly condemned North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il and Saddam Hussein for their tyranny, brutality and oppression. But he neglected to mention how Rumsfeld heartily supported Iraq in its 1980s war against Iran, ignoring the gassing of Kurds, Iraqis and Iranians. Hussein was an impotant pawn then, if for no other reason than that he fought America's great Persian enemy.<br />Even now, Bush entertains and rewards President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan, President Askar A. Akayev of Kyrgyzstan, President Nursultan Nazabayev of Kazakhstan and President Saparmurad A. Niyazov of Turkmenistan because they allowed its troops to use their bases and fly over their territories.  Democracy in these countries? The word is unknown. Their leaders are Stalinist relics of the old Soviet Union, hardly paragons for liberty, democracy, freedom and an open society. But they do know how to flatter the US.<br />Johnson has given us a polemic, but one soundly grounded in an impressive array of facts and data. The costs of empire are a nation's sorrow, he contends. He documents a growing system of propaganda, disinformation and glorification of war and military power. In an extreme, he even fears economic bankruptcy as the president underwrites these adventures with a congressional blank check while neglecting growing problems of education, health care and a decaying physical infrastructure in the land hitherto known for its openness and success.<br />A highly thought-provoking read, and a must for any collector's shelves.nd Iranians.

I don't know what angers me more: the absolutely startling facts unraveled in this book, or the sad reality that such jaw-dropping research is at a sub-15000 ranking in terms of sales on Amazon and has garnered only 3 reviews.<br />I happened to buy this book perchance while casually browsing the non-fic section at an airport. Now I recall my hair standing on its end as I read it on my flight. The only other book I recall seething with anger with while reading was &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;.<br />&quot;Gold Warriors&quot; is more than a nail in the coffin of Japan's &quot;serious, sober and deliberate&quot; plundering of Asia's treasure from 1895 until 1945, and its collusion after the war with American officials to recover and use the loot as a secret political action slush fund to denounce communism. It is in fact a journey into the darkest recesses of history and the human soul.<br />The authors are not afraid to name names, and the excruciatingly detailed research is a marvel. The sheer scale and limits of the underlying deceit are mind blowing.<br />Some very minor observations. The authors may know their Philippines well, but their statements on Japan could be corrected. The book has some minor errors (that I could figure out) --<br />(1) The Japanese ship they repeatedly call the &quot;Huzi&quot; should actually be &quot;Fuji&quot;<br />(2) The important Japanese Sea port is &quot;Maizuru&quot; not &quot;Maisaru&quot;<br />(3) &quot;Tairiki&quot; is not a Japanese word: they probably meant &quot;Tairiku Ronin&quot;, i.e., a Continental adventurer (in reference to Chinese carpetbaggers)<br />(4) Their mysterious &quot;Lord Ichivara&quot; should most likely be &quot;Ishihara&quot; (Ichivara is somewhat implausible)<br />Anyway, these are minor cavils. I highly recommend this book for any one interested in the shenanigans of power, it will leave you aghast.

SURE, AS IS REALITY.	Let's face it. Each one of us has been in a conversation some time or the other about the fallibility or otherwise of US being embroiled with weaker nations in recent times (Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia etc.)<br />I have often wondered if the recent Saddam hunt, or the 1991 Gulf war, etc. are isolated events for new-found initiatives like &quot;Hunt for terror&quot; or &quot;WMD&quot;. A measure as drastic as a war always couches a non-trivial history, a string of events on either side that made such confrontation inevitable. How do you put together all the OTHER peccadilloes of OTHER American administrations in OTHER countries to form a comprehensive perspective of US' motives?<br />This is what sets Chomsky's work apart from so many others who write social and political theory today.<br />The real meat of his work lies in the analysis produced from a re-examination of American history's key moments, and weaving it back into context. This helps us formulate a grippingly consistent and plausible set of motives for US foreign policy actions rather than the hyperbolic calls for democracy and totalitarian regime change that we have become so accustomed to hearing.<br />For instance, was the US really concerned with democracy when it supported a viscous proxy war in Nicaragua, even though their government had been democratically elected? Is the US truly interested in peace in the Middle East when it denies the &quot;Saudi Plan&quot; set forth in early 2002, which would offer &quot;full recognition and integration [of Israel] into the region in exchange for withdrawal to the 1967 borders? Why the compulsion for war with Iraq when no imminent threat of WMD's could be found, no connection to Al Qaida could be proven, and multiple studies were produced by leading agencies suggesting that invading Iraq would only decrease domestic security?<br />The answers for Chomsky are surprisingly consistent with what he feels are a foreign policy guided by imperial global expansion and military dominance. Countries must be &quot;aligned&quot; with US interest in order to ensure capital penetration and corporate and military hegemony.<br />If a country does not choose to align, then it will wind up a target of US backed aggression, or branded a &quot;terrorist state.&quot; In 1965, Indonesia expressed its intention to be independent. A US backed coup ensued, killing close to 1,000,000 people, and installed the brutal dictator General Suharto.<br />On the other hand, if a country does choose to align, as is the case with countries like Israel, Turkey or Pakistan, they become &quot;client states&quot; and are protected under the aegis of the American military, and given monetary and military aid. Although Turkey is run by an iron fisted dictator with an abysmal human rights record, and Pakistan has installed a joke of a government with clear cut involvements with Libya, North Korea etc, the US government makes concessions for their actions, as they are conducive to America's &quot;strategic interests.&quot;<br />You get the idea. It's a boon that Chomsky's extensive research has been compiled and bound into one neat volume to lend perspective to a dizzying volume of contemporary history.<br />Is this book controversial? Sure. It sets an incisive lens on reality, which is no less controversial (how else would you term the whole recent ordeal of Iraq?)<br />I highly recommend this pithy volume.

Which makes for an indulging read indeed, although the supporting evidence is occasionally lacking and the inferences about the future are to the tune of \\"It's unpredictable, time will tell.\\"<br />You've probably read other authors crunch economic data or political misgivings of the sushi nation, but Nathan turns his gaze to schools, novels, manga comic books, and the minds of young entrepreneurs and maverick local politicians. Is Japan's notoriously conformist society finally giving in to the longstanding recession? How is this affecting national identity?<br />We first take up the issue of social corrosion. No surprise there, Japan is in a crisis. An incisive lens is directed at the schooling system, which is now a hotpot of truancy, felonies, alienation, angst amongst increasingly wayward kids. Sadly, parents are woefully underprepared to handle these issues, as are school authorities.<br />Next we take the jingoistic extremism and of course, as people close to Japan may expect, the whacky governor of Tokyo Ishihara comes up, contrasted to the softer Tanaka of Nagano. A third person in the fray, the popular cartoonist Kobayashi, contends that Japan should in fact drop its US-linked past and become more self-assured. All of this makes for a very pithy discussion, but there may be little here that's new to people who follow Japanese news. To others, these essays alone alone are reason to grab the book.<br />Now for the minor gripes. The section that highlights the growing capitalism cites the same pseudo-successful entrepreneurs to claim that Japan is becoming more entrepreneurial: Masayoshi  and Oki Matsumoto (sigh, Monex!). To be fair, Japan does have a growing list of people stringing out on their own, but a recent Nikkei Weekly article did a much less sycophantic job of enumerating more convincing and down-to-earth examples.<br />The author also gives in to sweeping statements such as his claim of America's encouragement to Japan to beef up its nuclear arsenal in order to egg China into getting involved with the North Korea issue. Where did this come from?<br />Finally, be warned that the tone of the book in general is somewhat murky, and there is preciously little in terms of What Next, or How To Deal With It.<br />Forgivable weaknesses? May be. For me, the book was an insightful read. At the very least, it'll equip you with interesting little tidbits for those Oh-Japan dinner conversations. In particular people who don't have the time to follow Japanese news on a regular basis will probably find this book eye-opening.<br />A worthy purchase.examples.<br />The author also gives in to sweeping statements such as his claim of America's encouragement to Japan to beef up its nuclear arsenal in order to egg China into getting involved with the North Korea issue.

It's a relief to see Grisham going back to legal nailbiters instead of mundane novellas like Bleachers.<br />Yet, his latest (somewhat annoyingly only available in hardcover!) is more than a thriller. It has a good dose of humor and some pithy social commentary on racism and its aftermath in 1970s Mississippi -- the town of Clayton where the novel is set clearly has larger woes to worry about that the rape + murder of our young protagonist.<br />Yet, for this precise reason, The Last Juror is not a very tight novel. I could weed out page after page of racially inclined banter that lends very little to the overall plot. In fact the title &quot;The Last Juror&quot; -- which refers to the first black juror in the Ford County -- is a little misleading as she remains relatively cursory to the plot. You'll recall from an earlier Grisham called &quot;The Juror&quot; that the title referred to the juror in question, who was the lynchpin of the plot.<br />Here though, I found myself skimming pages, skipping entire chapters etc and comfortably finishing the novel anyway without missing out on any pivotal fact. I wonder if this filler text was Grisham's way of pandering to the town that launched his career (he began as a Mississippi lawyer) or to make up for the very little space this novel would have otherwise occupied...<br />All in all, it's a worthy read, and the writing is fluent and enjoyable as usual, but you've seen more gripping fiction from the ilk of Grisham.	2004-02-14

But I devoured this brilliant debut novel from Scott Card (1985) from cover to cover. It's intoxicating, educational and very, very gripping.<br />We follow the life of our young protagonist Ender (nickname for Andrew) who is billed as a dynamic potential leader to save the Earth from &quot;buggers&quot; (malicious aliens). Reviewers lament that it potrays children as saviours of the earth from but this is not exactly an impossibility -- kids today are already a lot sharper than they used to be 20 years ago. It's a fascinating testament to the adaptability of human beings -- you impose demands, we will rise to the task. Come to think of it, the book does frequently bring up the inhumane element of pushing kids to the limit as Ender gets disillusioned about the mission that was forced on him several times during the course of the story.<br />Above all its interesting setups and games in a training camp in space, the book touches upon some out-of-box thinking by kids to win their games. For this reason, it makes for a FABULOUS strategy book. As Ender wins and develops into a leader of kids a lot older than he is, we are exposed to a lot of leadership situations that are so real in actual life it's almost eerie.<br />The book has a bunch of lessons about morality, good and bad, leadership, thinking, etc etc. Something I'd recommend in a blink to anyone I care about. Get this phenomenal novel even if you don't have a taste for science fiction. You'll love it.	2004-02-11

A quick read of the reviews here has me wondering what the other readers were expecting from this book. Bushnell writes (or has been known to write, I guess) for the New York Observer. It'd be a tall order to line up expectations of literary ingenuity or deep mystique about the characters that 4 Blondes is about. Three of the four leads are single, all live in NYC, and all socialize with (or aspire to socialize with) the type of people who read or appear in High Society sections of leading dailies.<br />This is a novel of manners with no manners, pop literature that smartly captures the mores and obsessions of our times and does so with wit, insight and a lot of unshackled talk about sex. We read about enough penises to make Philip Roth blush.<br />It's a snappy, quick breeze through modern urban pop culture.

The writing in this *executive book* is fluent, reminiscent of Clayton's Innovator's Dilemma. Which makes this a readable book.<br />But the idea is VERY ordinary if you think about it for more than a minute, a near-mindless rehash of perfectly predictable research methods that are already prevalent and have been available (and exercised) for decades, which means do not expect any solutions to the intriguing and universal problem Clayton posed in &quot;Dilemma.&quot;<br />We are presented with example after example of how companies have missed out on customer targeting. The big token example is of a milkshake retail outlet, which just mistargeted their clientele. The authors then reveal the big tra-la find that this firm's customers in the morning were health-unconscious commuters who  needed something to sip on trains, and some kids in the evening...etc etc.<br />One wonders if the authors have been so busy writing this tripe that something called qualititative marketing research totally escaped their radar. I could count a dozen MR companies *off-hand* that could conduct simple research like this in a matter of 1 week, and have the results on my desk by next Friday.<br />So much for the &quot;solution.&quot; I was sorely disappointed with this book because I have the utmost regard for Clayton. Grab this biz pulp for embellishing your next staff speech. But manage your expectations in terms of real take-aways.	2004-02-01

You know you've read an epic novel when its 5th line had you sucked hook line and sinker. This 2-time &quot;just missed Pulitzer&quot; masterpiece from RM was stuck in my hands until I had it smacked down to the very last word. Immaculate piece of literature, this, you'll be an instant RM convert.<br />Although it's named &quot;A Fine Balance&quot;, this novella is one of those rare gems that simply blow you out of the bubble in which you lead your life -- impervious to the extremeties around you. I found myself almost living in the world of our 4 protagonists as they go go from bouquets to brickbats. Mistry's fluent and witty language only eggs you on, I found myself amused and chuckling at many points in the book, and hard as it is to admit, I even had my eyes welled up on more occasions than I can remember.<br /><br />Our protagonists are simple people, mind you. A couple of tailors, a young woman who makes her life sewing, her brother who makes it in &quot;business&quot;. The idiosynchrasies of each character, their daily peccadiloes, the minute lens with which we are exposed to their smallest emotions, joys and fears -- as a peak into the ordinary Indian life, I simply cannot imagine a more accurate or grittier novel in recent memory.<br />India is indeed a country where the sinister contours of social strata (the caste system, to be specific) often seem clumsy, ominous or just plain grotesque, where deep ideological divisions feed into and exacerbate ordinary social mores. Even external dangers play themselves out domestically. A Fine Balance brims with such clear-eyed, tragicomic, Dickens-like observations of the Indian fabric.<br />Ingenious, wholesome, and deeply moving. Not just for Indians or people interested in India, this novel is a delight to read for ANYONE even mildly interested in literature. Highly, highly recommended!	2004-01-19

This riveting book could easily have inspired \\"Vertical Limit\\" or \\"K2.\\" I wouldn't be surprised if someone picked up a copy from my bed stand, started reading, and thought it was a fiction thriller.<br />Yet, \\"Into thin air\\" is an actual memoir of what happened at a particular clambering mission to the top in May 1996. The reader is sucked in to a world and an adventure not ordinarily experienced. We get to know each Sherpa (Nepalese guide), his team, and the painstaking preparations and procedures it takes to accomplish this feat. The pain, the hardships, the loss of sense caused by the brutal cold and the lack of oxygen are all so palpably described I found myself breathing deeply!<br />The author is not only a veteran mountain climber (with one mishap, of course) but a superb raconteur as well. While the nuts and bolts of his adventures are entertainment enough, his knack for building suspense and employing understated drama makes this memoir read a top-notch script for a Hollywood thriller.<br />Highly recommended for a gripping narrative of a real-life adventure!<br />[Note: The book is available for real cheap if you buy it used here at Amazon, and also as an audio tape.]	2004-01-10

If you want to read an author who can almost effortlessly draw you into the tapestry of his characters, in 600 pages and yet without frittering away a single word, then you have to love Steinbeck! What makes this 1952 novel the timeless opus that I believe it is (now fortunately in new paperback version thanks to Oprah,)  is that ANY reader can relate to it on so many levels.<br />You may find the story winding and complicated at the outset, peopled by characters that are often virtuous in some ways and flawed in others. But soon you'll realize how real these people are, and you'll be reading on if only to figure out what happens to each of them. The plot and the author's beautiful descriptive passages pull you along at a refreshing pace once you are into it.<br />Although the main character's name is Adam, it's the Biblical story of Cain and Abel that is played out over and over with characters whose names begin with \\"C\\" and \\"A\\". Adam's father, Cyrus, is quite the wild man. Adam's brother, Charles, tries to kill him. Adam's wife, Cathy, abandons him and their newborn twins to pursue the lifestyle of evil she cannot escape. Their children Aron and Caleb continue as opponents trying to vie for their father's attention until the bitter end.<br />And when you finish trudging through the entire thing, you'll feel like having actually lived and breathed the philosophies and lessons of a lifetime. Steinbeck's acute awareness of the interplay of his themes despite his lingusitic economy is an absolute joy to behold. His characters are specific and alive, mirroring real people and their foibles.<br />I highly recommend this classic piece of literature but be prepared to read. It's not your average pulp.	2004-01-05

It's amazing that not one of Brown's works has been snapped up for a movie because just about any one of his thrillers would make for top grossers.<br />If you have read the Da Vinci code, or Angels and Demons, you don't need much convincing to pick up a Dan Brown yarn. But I believe Deception Point is *the* best work yet from Brown, and not only because the riveting plot and its very relateable characters are far removed from the theological.<br />There's a hint of romance here, couched of course in a twist you'd not have figured. Throughout the book I was pretty certain that I had the &quot;bad guys&quot; worked out, but Brown is a master of pulling the rug from under your feet just when you thought you had it figured.<br />Some reviewers lament that the story develops slowly. Frankly, I loved moments in this novel when the underlying technology, gadgets etc are described. Dan Brown is a superlative writer, the modern Grisham if you will.<br />Deception Point is a topnotch thriller, highly recommended!	2003-12-27

I wonder why so many one liner reviews for this topnotch thriller opine (in a suspiciously similar juvenile language I may add) that this is not Grisham's best work. Well, may be. But this novel, quite like any other from him, is crispy, fast-paced and very very morally charged.<br />The setting is familiar: a hard-driving grunt lawyer from nowhere, who ever so unknowingly stumbles upon the case of his life, and gets all tangled up in a mess he couldn't have imagined. Several self-same characters line the plot: a rich-man's daughter as a love interest (who's also a model), the girlfriend's insufferably affluent and thus uptight parents, a tried and trusted friend/coworker who'll be right by our lawyer's side, and even an African-American culprit who fell prey to his circumstances (drugs and mafia, of course).<br />There's jetliners (&quot;a kitchen, a bar and restroom in the rear; the latest avionics up front for the pilots&quot;) and high society, suspenseful chases and delectable sleuthing. But this is the ONLY novel I've read from Grisham which had me in a twist over identities. I never quite knew who the good guys, or the protagonists, or both, were. Without divulging any spoilers, I'll say it is something you'll be surprised with. Avarice has no friends.<br />Don't mind the other reviews. This is vintage classy Grisham, with his punchy writing style, and quite a refreshing break from semi-clunkers like The Bleachers or Skipping Christmas.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-11-16

I like to think of myself as a fairly tech-savvy guy so if someone suggests that he has something to tell me about my PC that I don't already know, it's a bit difficult to warm up to.<br />But Steve's book, like his PC World column, didn't fail to surprise me! It is everything that you expect from a typical O'Reilly publication: crisp, entertaining, and to-the-point. We cut to the chase pretty quickly: the annoyances, the solution, and some pretty nifty add-on humor if you are lucky. We get top-notch tips from spam control, to email management tricks, to virii solutions, to NAT woes, to some cool utility recommendations.<br />NOTES/CAVEATS:<br />(1) The book is relevant to Windows users only. Unless I have missed something, I doubt there is anything here for *nix/*nux or Mac users.<br />(2) It's a book you probably won't read from cover to cover, but it came pretty close to that for me. A handy little reference stacked with some tips I wouldn't have thought about.<br />(3) I wonder if there is much here that you couldn't find out yourself if you were game for a liberal dose of quality googling time, but it is pretty handy to have all this printed, pressed and neatly bound for 24-7 access between your fingers.<br />(4) Speaking of which, I felt at first blush that the price was a bit steep for a tech self-help book, but in hindsight it is worth every shining nickel!<br />(5) For a pretty good whiff of the book's style and content, check out the \\"Five More Annoying PC Annoyances\\" on O'reilly's website (google for it). I believe the site also has a sample chapter from this book unless they've removed it when you read this review.<br />All in all, I highly recommend this handy little volume for just about anyone who who pushes the START button!	2003-11-10

Yet, apart from its economic clout in that period, this legendary network of roads across Central Asia (as opposed to one highway that most people believe Silk Road was) served as a bustling conduit for culture, languages, customs and faiths across the nations. It was veritably an eBay of the olden times!<br />In her sobering language littered with intriguing trivia, Ms Wood takes us through centuries of interest in this road. It is refreshing to see her get brazenly outspoken about imperialistic motives towards the latter part of the 19th century that ruined the legendary route, when a lot of European merchants focused on pilfering away everything from cave Buddhas to gold.<br />At nearly 300 pages, it is not a trivial tome, but I found it both accessible and entertaining. Oh, and it comes with a bunch of illustrations and pictures. If such a vivid historical production interests you, I highly recommend this informative book.	2003-11-09

Everything even remotely within the gamut of marketing is smooshed in to this all-encompassing treatise. No reason, they felt for instance, to leave out traditional creative that successfully carries &quot;shock value&quot; (e.g., voyeuristic ads) and thus by implication, &quot;buzz.&quot;<br />Personally, I was specifically interested in examples of usage of new media such as mobile phones or blogging, but both these issues get abysmally meagre mention in the book. A case of Amnesty International from Netherlands is mentioned regarding the use of SMS. As for blogs, we are recommended, in 2 paltry pages of coverage, to keep ourselves &quot;apprised&quot; with what users around the world may be writing about our brands.<br />That's a bit like saying corporate governance is crucial for business, so well, keep your accounts clean. Right. How about a conceptual or theoretical framework, or even just a couple of concrete suggestions to actually DO something about it?<br />While the case studies are occasionally nifty -- e.g., MTV's hold on the spring break season for the youth in US; or Nando's in South Africa which uses creative advertising to position itself against McDonalds and KFC -- the book simply flip-flops all across the board trying to flesh out the fashionable catchet of buzz.<br />In the absence of any directional guidelines about how to CATALYZE such &quot;buzz,&quot; the book falls a bit short of it promised claims. I'd still give it a 3/5 for a pretty interesting marketing read in general, it's just the title that's a bit of a gyp.	2003-11-09

With that in mind, it is a marvel enough that this book is in publication.<br />Armed with an Internet connection and a blogger account, Pax leaves no stone unturned in the unabashed description of the attitude of his friends and family towards the US, but also to Saddam Hussein's Baathist dictatorship. The dominant theme of his caustic blog is a deep mistrust of American motives, and the text veritably seers with subdued anger, but Pax's skepticism is informed by a tenacious Iraqi nationalism.<br />Like many people potentially affected by wars, I devour a lot of news sources, including political blogs (some more informative than others) but it is usually difficult to see a clear perspective of the people who are physically on the receiving end of enemy scuds unless you live, breathe and sleep in the context of that news.<br />Pax has done a pretty fascinating job of organizing his book, it is eye-opening! For instance, one big anomaly in global news coverage from CNN/Fox/etc lies in introducing Iraq as this hapless nation fragmented by a bevy of races and religions. Yet Pax strongly argues that following recent protracted hostilities with Iran and Kuwait, Iraq itself has been boasting a very strong nationalistic fabric. I wonder how this glaring reality can escape international scribes?<br />If only the decision-makers in London and Washington take the time to consult the voice of the people (such as Pax's) before waging full-scale wars, their understanding about the country they are now scampering to control can perhaps be greatly helped.<br />I highly commend Mr. Pax on his efforts, and wish the best to his book, blog and other activism endeavours. If this thought-provoking, entertaining, and occasionally even infuriating compilation of his blog entries is anything to go by, I surely will be reading more of him!	2003-11-09

This runs for about 70 pages in length and is somewhat less charming I believe. Diamant has written nonfiction books previously, The Red Tent being her first novel, and her documentary-style factual musings show through in this first part of the novel -- I felt I was reading a detailed history of childbirthing, not a novel.<br />But that changes with the second part of the book, the life of Leah's daughter, Dinah. This is where I felt the true story takes off.<br />Dinah, still young, meets Shalem, a handsome Egyptian man of wealth and status and falls in love with him. This infatuation is reciprocated, and for a time the two engage in merry lovemaking. But these joys of communion quickly run dry as a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\"-esque drama ensues when their families do not necessarily see eye-to-eye on the proposed union.<br />It's a long novel, and a bit melodramatic if you will. Some descriptions of sexual relations are a bit too explicit for comfort, and made me wonder how they contributed to the novel. But the other bits in the book make it all worthwhile, particularly the female camaraderie -- we get a vivid picture of such bonds among wives, concubines, and the children they raised in concert. The ultimate denouement lends a simple but effective lesson to accept life and its pleasures/travails for what they are.<br />I guess anyone interested in either religious or social history would find this book fascinating. Even for the rest of us, this is an evocative read that I'd recommend in a blink!	2003-11-09

This romp through a coterie of different fields is gratifying, as is Zaltman's captivating writing style.<br />I bet you will come away with some thought-provoking ideas. For instance, there's a suggestion that you could segment your markets along entirely new lines. Among other things, brain scans could be used to classify your customer base into people who prefer visual communications and those who prefer auditory ones, and then target the first group with a newspaper display ad and the second with a radio spot.<br />But now for my paltry quibbles. While I adore the way the theory is constructed, I do not entirely agree with the author's ideas. Some ambiguous findings are shrugged off with &quot;Qualitative research is not a replacement, it is complementary.&quot; The truth in some of the cases is that all his metaphorical attempts with showing of eccentric visuals etc do not always lead to any more exhilerating insights than could have been attained through other forms of research, or plain gut instinct.<br />For instance, consider his study of executive MBA students at Harvard Business School who were questioned: &quot;What do you mean by customer focused?&quot; Part of the answer: It means collecting information, analyzing data, anticipating customer needs - all exactly what customer-service gurus advise. But further elicitation revealed another part of the answer: Being customer-focused means having integrity, caring about customers in an authentic way, being a company worthy of trust. This leads Zaltman to the conclusion that &quot;The executives were surprised by how much of their individual thinking was shared by others, although they had never discussed these things with anyone.&quot;<br />I am not sure how &quot;having integrity, caring about customers, being a company worthy of trust&quot; translates into something seminal?<br />This is not to trivialize the impact of this book. I love it. I love the WAY in which the theory is constructed. Chances are you will indeed be goaded into thinking of issues pertinent to your function and gain a good deal of insight into how human beings assess and operate (spoiler: in images, not in linguistically confined words.)<br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly, perhaps even a must-read book for anyone involved in psychology or strategy, but just keep your reality hats on.of trust.

When I started reading this particular book, I knew it would be a good number to review. So I started marking everything in the book that I disagreed with or that I felt was worth commenting on.<br />That the Ries duo relies on sweeping statements (e.g., &quot;Quality of a product doesn't matter. It's all about brands.&quot;) hardly made my intentions any easier. Needless to say, my copy of 22 Immutable Laws of Branding is riddled with lots of ink and copious sidenotes. There is a lot I said &quot;Really?&quot; to while reading.<br />But maybe that's the thing I adore about Ries Inc.  Their books are anything but boring manuals on a topical issue so relevant to almost anyone in business. I was &quot;involved&quot; with this book like I have seldom been with a work of non-fiction. I adored and went all retrospective with the &quot;Law of the Name&quot; and the &quot;Law of Globalism&quot;. The writing is trippy, semi-provocative and hence absolutely delectable in a piece of work such as this!<br />Do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly. A wonderfully satisfying read. Just keep your discerning senses about you and think twice before wrapping your (brand management) career around all the advice this book proffers.<br />Noteworthy: The whole book is also available in a PDF version, if you are not particularly averse to on-screen reading.	2003-10-29

Amazon.com recommended to me while reading up on \\"The Great Indian Novel\\", which is a novel. This is somewhat misleading, because \\"Sex Scotch and Scholarship\\" is NOT a novel.<br />It is a compilation of Khushwant Singh's more popular writings -- he is a regular columnist of some repute in India, usually seen as the country's more maverick souls, associated mainly with his best-selling ribald jokebooks which pack a bunch of double entendres.<br />This collection though is not just a light-hearted one. It spans a wide range of Singh's moorings -- from a near-lyrical chapter on his passions for nature to the predicaments in his home state in northern India (Punjab), where he primarily laments the notion of \\"Khalistan\\" -- a separate state for rebels -- an idea he is opposed to. There's an interesting take on religions of the world, especially his own (Sikhism). To lighten the vein somewhat, we get an amusing glimpse of his years as a Member of Parliamnet. Finally, as the only other review on this site mentions, there're some essays on Singh's travels around the globe (predominantly South East Asia.)<br />As irreverent yet thoughtful writing as Singh is typically known for. Interesting nuggets and ramblings from a good writer, but may not be very relevant for non-Indians unless you have at least a passing familiarity with what I talked about above.	2003-10-25

The reality is, most &quot;leaders&quot; think they don't have to roll up their sleeve and &quot;execute&quot;. They believe their buck stops at &quot;strategizing&quot;.<br />At the end of the day, you bet on people, not on strategies. Strategies are intellectually simple; their execution is not simple. The question is, can you execute? That's what differentiates one company from another.<br />I thought this book would be about doozy ideas rehashed to be a &quot;business book&quot;. But I found the book a common sensical narrative of HOW the executives mentioned (from AT&amp;T, GE, Colgate-Palmolive, J&amp;J etc -- some more successful than others) actually managed their delivery and ascent.<br />Brilliant book.

For a very thorough yet accessible intro (or refreshers course) to calculus, this book is unbeatable.<br />But given that you are even reading this page, and are thus quite likely in the same predicament as I was -- that of finding a book on the subject that is indeed an &quot;idiot's&quot; guide -- I will compare this book with the major other competing title: &quot;Calculus For Dummies.&quot;<br />I spent a couple of days deciding between the two. In general, I trust the &quot;Dummies&quot; line more, having had a good experience with their computer oriented books. However, their calculus offering does not have the &quot;Look Inside&quot; feature on Amazon.com.<br />So, being my usually onerous self, I went to a physical bookstore to look for the two books. Although the dummies book is ALSO laid out in a similarly coherent fashion, I think this Idiots Guide does a better job of keeping the unnecessary jokes at a minimum, and focusing on the matter succintly yet lucidly. Didn't take that much of a time to decide really after I looked inside the books.<br />My very subjective but educated opinion? Get this one. Brilliant and to-the-point.	2003-10-24

Funny, because a bit of literaly license is not uncommon, e.g., in the description of the Pyramids in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (Agatha Christie), or old England imagery from Sherlock Holmes, or the veracity of &quot;Blairwitch Project.&quot; This is not intended as a documentary, it is fiction, so it is in fact quite a positive thing that it mirrors reality SO closely.<br />As a sinister thriller with a killer plot, be prepared to immerse in speculation, action and intrigue. Fascinating.

So what. ...<br />I am still fascinated by the chequered career of \\"Madam Secretary\\", who came from a Czech refugee family that first fled Hitler and then the communists. After reaching America, her zigzagging life eventually landed her in the upper echelon of American diplomacy and policy-making. This path alone makes this memoir worth every little centimeter of every frayed penny you spend on it.<br />This is an outspoken work, and it provides a ringside view of a world in unprecedented turbulence. No, I do not think the authors were fawning a political celeb. It contains a colorful portrait of several other big tykes -- the Clintons, Colin Powell, Jesse Helms, Vaclav Havel, Yasser Arafat, Ariel Sharon, King Hussein, Vladimir Putin, Slobodan Milosevic, and North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-Il. All this tirade, whether your polemical filter reconciles with it or not, makes for quite an interesting read.<br />As regards weaving an intimate and panoramic tapestry of Madeleine's character, well the writing is fluent, tight, and very interesting. I seldom devour politically charged reminiscences with such zeal. It is clearly self-billed as a \\"memoir, so I did not expect it to be a highly objective analysis of political stances, if there were such a beast to begin with.<br />In my book, this comes highly recommended. Will definitely not bore you if that is any consolation. Come to think of it, I guess it also makes for a great movie theme.	2003-10-22

My intent is to help potential buyers decide if this book is worth their time/money.<br />Ian Wright's detour into political polemics (he is a children's book writer in general) is quite endearing but unfortunately a little sentimentalistic and egregiously one-sided. The title, which is what made me spend on this book, is pretty much the only enticing thing you'll find here. I wonder if Wright was trying to pull off a Michael Moore effort?<br />I have nothing againts cavillars, indeed it is even interesting at times to read highly opinionated counter-intuitive takes on matters that impact the world, not just US. But if you are serious about pithy issues such as the propriety of war and its modes, you may be better off with the well-researched tomes of Bob Kagan, Noam Chomsky, or Farid Zakaria.	2003-10-21

I could even say it is well-written.<br />But it may be instructive to note that the book represents ONE perspective about SOME arbitrarily chosen companies based on ONE metric, the data for which were collected and analyzed POST-HOC (known as \\"posthoc bias\\" to those in the know.) If you are expecting to come away with any pearls of wisdom about effective leadership or corporate success, you are preparing yourself for a mild disappointment.<br />Here are the insights you'll be exposed to, so make up your mind about how earth-shattering the offerings of this book are:<br />[1] Best leaders are not high profile folk but subdued, humble yet focused people who get results. (Not sure. Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Jack Welch, Larry Flynt, Rupert Murdoch etc come to mind)<br />[2] Great leaders are supposed to believe in teamwork (Shlurp! Teamwork! Must make for a deliciously innovative reading)<br />[3] Companies need to focus on their \\"key profitability ratio\\" and hone it down to succeed. (Just me, or this swan-song of \\"focus\\" is painfully cliche? Also makes one wonder if business context is stagnant. What happens with KFC, Cadillac, Zenith who have tasted what it feels to run out of steam with a once beaming audience..would honing down their KPRs help? No mechanism to track these KPRs is forthcoming, that is your homework)<br />All in all, a tough call. I'd still recommend the book for some thoughtful inflight reading, if only for the WAY the authors make their case, but don't expect anything spectacular to ground your business/career on.	2003-10-19

Foer is a pretty endearing writer, no doubt, and one who is already on my watch list. But this novel is  not something I'd be seen heaping praises on, as several other reviewers have been.<br />The book's narrative is inventive, mildly funny (depending on your sense of humor) and occasionally even strewn with streaks of universal wisdom. But some of Foer's devices of story telling seem a little, er, affected.<br />The lead-in into the novel is a bit wobbly and I took time to warm up to the goings-on -- in reality, the it is a tapestry of SEVERAL stories, the prime theme being one of a young American Jew named Jonathan Safran Foer (eponymous as the author, note) who travels to the Ukraine searching for the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in 1941. We read of his search through the eyes of his Ukrainian guide and translator, Alex, whose imperfect English provides comic relief.<br />Part of the story of Jonathan's search is told in straightforward prose, but part is told through letters from Alex. Other stories are told in dreams or in plays. Concurrently, we also get the story of several of Jonathan's forbears, going as far back as 1791.<br />Much of the novel's humor stems from Alex's under-developed English and his posturing antics. Such comic relief is deft, but the all too frequent flights of lyricism stink of affectation to me, not of staggeringly impressive command of language or anything. Foer is no Wodehouse, not yet.<br />Everything Is Illuminated is ultimately more of an experience than a book, an episodic, thoughtful and rewarding work. But perhaps you may want to start with a fresh slate instead of a baggage of high expectations, a mistake I made. It is not worthy of a pedestal, but definitely worth a read if only for the sheer boldness of the narrative. Pick it up!	2003-10-18

Lahiri's characters come alive in her simple yet moving language, almost like Italio Calvino's.<br />If you read \\"Interpreter of Maladies,\\" you need no introduction to this brilliant writer. Get this book and savor it. The fluid style, an undercurrent of the vagaries of cultural dislocation, and the worldliness of her characters are almost in continuation of her touching yarns from \\"Interpreter..\\"<br />If you are considering this author for the first time, Lahiri has a way of getting under the skin of her characters and painting a wonderful web of life's simple moments. The lead character, Gogol, is vintage Lahiri: a man baffled by split national identities. We follow a trail of his life as he grows up in an alien environs, with different people and mores. But Lahiri, with her seamless literary skills, cuts through life's usual messiness to reveal some fundamental themes - about how people cope with love, adaptation, family, and the perpetual quest for a mooring.<br />To allow myself a \\"harsh critic\\" moment, perhaps some of the non-protagonist characters get a short shrift in terms of ink-time -- the parents and the sister of Gogol, for instance, never really transcend their cardboard descriptions. The novel overall left me with a feeling of not having taken any risks other than what her stories in \\"Interpreter..\\" had already embraced. But these are trivial, subjective quibbles.<br />This is a highly recommended gem of a read.	2003-10-17

Little surprise then that it has provoked such pointless debate here in the reviews.

That a satirist-cum-political-commentator can speak with such rapier wit and make a convincing case of Bush-clan's ludicrous misgivings is pretty neat in and of itself. I mean, the book even has charts.<br />WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE BOOK:<br />Although I don't relate to some of the people referred to in the book (e.g., Bernie Goldberg, Sean Hannity), at its heart the book is about the core political debate between conservatives and liberals - and the ideological divide between the Bush administration and Democratic opposition which has been sorely deepened by the Iraq issue. This is a universal theme, and anything well written about it, especially when corroborated by accompanying facts, is a delight.<br />Second, Franken showcases some fascinating case studies on the way reporters report and commentators comment without the rigor that should be expected from their profession by definition. Once something is in the electronic cuttings, it's endlessly recycled whether it's true or not; and some of the funniest passages in the book are when Franken takes columnists to task over their dodgier claims.<br />Thirdly, like it or not, many of Bush's follies are ripped to shreds. I did not delude myself into thinking that Bush's is the only administration with these shenanigans, or goof-ups (I mean, burning off a 4.6 US$ surplus in 3 years is not a small feat!) But somehow Dubya lends himself rather well to being the brunt of such humor. It's entertaining, at the very least.<br />AND WHAT'S BAD:<br />Franken's tone is ultra-sardonic, and thus quite soon into the book a bit gratingly shrill. Constant references to attempted humor such as \\"God spoke to me\\" get a bit irksome after 30 pages of refrains. Come to think of it, as intriguing as Franken's factoids and analyses are, if the needless fluff of language was chaffed out this book could easily be 60% its current size. But a minor quibble perhaps.<br />NET NET:<br />If you genuinely thought you'd get some insight into which wing lies more, you're probably not asking the right question.

He is a man you can look up to, he rose from waiting tables in Switzerland to being a hack philosopher. But here is something for the teenagers going gaga over his work.<br />His basic premise was clever, that our ancestors were approached and affected by aliens, for the same reasons that X-Files has caught the fancy of our generation. Most of it however is unsupported and some of it plain screwball.<br />Basically his big breakthrough came when he found the critical piece of evidence to back up his theories -- the Palenque Stone in Mexico. He claimed that a large stone in the temple at Palenque had a carving of a creature sitting as if inside a rocket. In truth though, archaeologist and Mayan expert Dr Ian Graham explained his view of the figure on the Palenque Stone -- that there was no proof that this being sitting inside a &quot;rocket&quot; was a &quot;spaceman.&quot; There weren't any oxygen tubes for examples, which would have been easy to sculpt by even &quot;primitive people&quot; such as Mayans. It was a standard Mayan face as is seen all around in the architecture of that period.<br />Several quotes from the bible such as &quot;a celestial beam of light&quot; etc were spun to reflect space travel (tractor beams of a space craft for e.g.) After several spells of ups and downs (for financial peccadiloes) Daniken's credibility was finally undermined after he was unable to substantiate claims made in another book, &quot;Gold of the Gods,&quot; that he had photographed metal plaques containing the wisdom of extraterrestrials. In 1977, a BBC Horizon programme, The Case of the Ancient Astronauts, took a rational look at his theories and showed them to be pseudo science.<br />Several other such &quot;wonders&quot; cited by von Daniken as corroboration for his theories were similarly debunked. In the late 1970s he rapidly disappeared from the public arena, and in 1982 he could not find an English or American publisher for his 10th book.  As though this were not enough, the guy has been arrested several times for petty crimes such as defrauding his hotelier boss in Zurich, to more elaborate ones such as being in unpaid bad debts of up to Euro 350,000.<br />While his books make for a fun read, primarily &quot;Chariots of the Gods&quot; as this is perhaps the only one that comes close to credibility, it is not a great idea to go about bandying ideas contained therein with a delusional passion usually associated with farts.

This is not the first time Grisham has taken a break from his usual forte -- thrillers veering around the legal profession. Both \\"Skipping Christmas,\\" a holiday tale, and \\"A Painted House,\\" a semi-autobiographical family saga, deviated from the legal themes, but they were compelling stories told with sumptuous passion and detail.<br />Bleachers is also a good book but is unfortunately several clicks below the class you would expect from a writer of Grisham's cadre. It is lean. Both literally, you can finish the book in a couple of lazy afternoons, and figuratively -- the theme is a popular but now dying football coach, responsible for several victories in his (unnamed) southern state, being visited by his old players for final goodbyes.<br />What follows is a now-touching-now-bland set of reminiscings about how a single-minded obsession and hero worship at a young age can affect many lives. The novel showed sporadic promise with some very fascinating narrative, followed by long patches where very little happens.<br />Grisham novels are expected to be material that Hollywood producers drool on.

READ IT FOR THE CASE STUDIES.	It is difficult to review a book that one has enjoyed reading and then say that it was not up to the mark (in terms, of course, of only my expectations.)<br />No doubt that Scott Bedbury's work is a fast paced read, his writing is lucid and quite frequently quotably light-hearted. There is a lot of material here for people in larger corporations or even general marketing folks. And where Bedbury truly shines is in the case studies he presents in the 8 chapters.<br />But if, like me, you set off on this book looking for some newfangled insights into the world of branding, this is not the book for you. The title claims to proffer &quot;8 principles&quot;. Let's face it -- at the end of the day, principles are not that hard to create, and this becomes quite clear when you reach the end of the book and wonder if you have learnt something new.<br />But I am being unfairly critical. From his style, it seems an approachable business book was precisely what Bedbury's intended?<br />As a comprehensive introduction to the field of branding, I'd recommend &quot;Strategic Brand Asset Management&quot; by Keller. For a discussion of some innovative yet reasonable forms of brand creation, especially on a shoestring, I'd usually point to a PR related book or &quot;60-minutes Brand Strategist.&quot;<br />But as a business book, to be read by executives on a plane and have ample to talk about, or as a non-technical introduction for neophytes to the branding industry who place less emphasis on a structured analytical framework and are more interested in a soft springboard into the field, &quot;Emotional Branding&quot; and this book from Bedbury are pretty near the top of my list of recommendations.<br />Good stuff, if you aren't expecting a summary of last decade's JCR.	2003-10-14

The identification Lahiri establishes between her readers and her characters requires the kind of simple, direct prose, not unlike R.K. Narayan's, where refinement is invisible but delectably evident. Reading these stories is comparable to one's first reaction to the great Russian novels: the fresh realization of the common humanity of all peoples.<br />Lahiri has the grace to make us feel close even to foolishness and timidity and naivete and the wit to make actions logical without being predictable. There is a good deal of surprise hidden among the lines. For instance, the most hapless of our characters, a maltreated shopgirl in &quot;The Treatment of Bibi Haldar&quot; who dreams hopelessly of winning a husband, surprises us with her unexpected tenacity.<br />The setting in the stories is mostly Asian, if not entirely Indian. Expect to get a whiff of lentils, spices, cut onions. Yet, the stories transcend the ethnic or geographical, and are a lingering look into frailties of common human behavior. I've often thought about the characters long after concluding a story.<br />Above all, the stories lend themselves elegantly to repeated reading.

Gould apparently is based on an actual figure by the same name...an English thief and artist, Bill Gould, who died in 1853.<br />Hammett becomes obsessed with Gould's paintings and accompanying stories of beaten convicts living out the last days of their existence at the mercy of a heartless commandant. So obsessed, in fact, that when the book is lost, the narrator sets out to rewrite it in the most minute detail and to the best of his ability.<br />And this is when the true story begins. Prior to Gould's story, the introductory pages are mostly the ramblings of a drunken narrator, which set the stage for Gould's tale but prolong the main course of the story. Gould's epic adventures in Australia's colonial past include colorful encounters with Jean Audubon and John Keats's brother before imprisonment, and then while in jail, with the prison storekeeper Jorgen Jorgensen and the surgeon-commandant Lampiere. It is the surgeon who orders Gould to make the book of fish, containing illustrations of marine life indigenous to the island, by using meager supplies but vast imagination.<br />What can one say -- this entire opus is a testimonial to the act of creation. Each chapter is printed in a different color and features a unique fish, mimicking the book-within-the-book. The packaging is beautiful. And such lingual dexterity! Depressing at times, it whisks the reader to an undeniably darker period in Australian history from page one.<br />Flanagan's prose is as vivid as it is delicious. And frequently a bit teasing to the reader's intelligence, but magical. A must-read for anyone even mildly interested in fiction!	2003-09-27

If one were to have a minor gripe, it would be that Reich gets a little carried away with a lot of unnecessary description of the environment, background etc...which really doesnt amount to much in terms of the plot. Yet, if you are a good skimmer, this should hardly be a problem.<br />Highly recommended action + spy thriller with a liberal dose of financial and tech trivia thrown in, which also makes for an intriguingly real look into the dark side of both the industries.	2003-09-13

In The Next Galary is yet another compendium of crackling wit, interrogating history from the vantage point of an aging (and impoverished?) woman -- Ruth is 86. Fluffy love poetry is not high on Stone's agenda, this is razor sharp and yet misleadingly simple, almost conversational, compilation of heavy themes wrapped in very light poems.<br />If you have a thing for poetry and haven't yet read Ruth Stone, this is as good a place to start as any. If you have read her already, this review is meaningless, you already know you ought to get this anthology too.	2003-09-07

Sullivan's writing is in and of itself a good enough reason to get your hands on this book as soon as you can, but beyond that, it belongs to that rare creed of books that you can read and laugh and still learn something off.<br />The approach is very down-to-earth. As the subtitle (A Guide to Creating Great Ads) states, it is meant to be instructive and in that it rocks. The advice is real and very, very valuable. The process of copywriting an ad is described, with copious accompanying notes on how to keep from falling into the usual traps.<br />Clearly fascinatingly relevant material for anyone in the advertising business, but an inspiring read for everyone else as well. Expect to relish some high quality humour too.	2003-07-31

This is a no-brainer of a purchase, laden with intriguing trivia and the educated but opinionated tirades you can only expect from an ex-CIA field officer.<br />Along with recounting the career of a spy who would go on to recruit agents in such places as India, Lebanon, Sudan, France and Tajikstan, See No Evil also details Baer's opinions for the CIA's decline from an agency that would do whatever was felt necessary to achieve its goal of eliminating security threats to the United States, into a toothless, politically correct organisation run by bureaucrats.<br />Baer's forte is to relate interesting, dangerous experiences in his fluent storytelling style. Conversely, its weakness, quite naturally, is what he is not able to tell us. Due to his employment contract with the CIA, there are operations he isn't allowed to divulge the details of, some he cannot acknowledge and even places where he operated that he cannot reveal. Undoubtedly the secretive nature of his job has also contributed to his personal life not receiving more than a superficial airing, resulting in only a modest insight into his personal motivations and drive.<br />Of course, the CIA has also had its external critics, but for different reasons. Its involvement with coups, funding of armed opposition groups in sovereign countries, and the like, has brought about calls for its reigning in or downright scrapping, whether it be due to concern over human rights abuses or its critics' ideological differences.<br />While that side of things (documented elsewhere) does not really get a mention in Baer's book (the closest he gets is in recalling his Beirut embassy bombing investigation, where he had the opportunity to have a terrorist suspect assassinated, but turned it down; regretting it later) that is not a reason to ignore this particular work, with its insight into a true believing ex-spy.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-07-30

The crux of Zakaria's argument is that democratically elected regimes are now routinely ignoring constitutional limits on their power and depriving their citizens of basic rights and freedoms. Apparently, he is supposed to have witnessed this first hand as a muslim growing up in India in the 60s and the 70s.<br />The sins of democracy, he maintains, go beyond the &quot;trampling of rights&quot; to include &quot;economic malfeasance and the impoverishment of peoples&quot; (in Russia, for instance, and post-Suharto Indonesia), &quot;the unleashing of religious fanaticism&quot; (notably in the Muslim world), &quot;the stoking of ethnic hatreds&quot; (in the Balkans, Africa, Central Asia, and the subcontinent).<br />Drawing on the work of the political scientists Edward Mansfield and Jack Snyder, Zakaria even asserts that, contrary to conventional wisdom about the &quot;democratic peace,&quot; democracies are more prone to militarism and war. We are told that when political systems are opened up, new groups of enfranchised voters make incompatible demands on leaders, who in turn try to &quot;rally the masses&quot; behind aggressive nationalist crusades.<br />Sound familiar?<br />Many of the examples in this very well researched and fairly well argued book are charged with what seems to be me to be a personal vendetta. Whatever your political moorings, you'll find yourself going &quot;Aha! You bet!&quot; often but will also revulse with disagreement equally frequently.<br />Which is precisely the reason to buy and read this book as soon as you can get your hands on it. It is thoughtful, uncanny, laden with facts, and even scandalous -- just the way I like it. Plus, there is lots to make you think about the quickly swelling imbalance of government in our world.	2003-07-22

I was almost swayed by the countless snivelling reviews that this book seems to have generated. Perhaps because it is a thinly veiled account of the author's actual (bitter, needless to say) experiences at Vogue magazine.<br />I am not sure I agree. It is quite an alright novel really, it makes no claim to be anything but pulp &quot;fiction&quot; and does a decent job of it.<br />The title is misleading, perhaps a direct jab at the author's former boss?  The story veers around a fashion magazine, things happen, women bicker, a galore of betrayals, bitterness and a lot of shallow vengeance. What's new? This is &quot;chick-lit&quot; and quite akin to what a million men and women read in pop mags like Vogue, Cosmo, Maxim, GQ etc everyday.<br />It's a fast and mildly-fun read for days at home when television is dry, or in the train if you commute, at least the title will turn a few heads for sure.

This thinly-veiled memoir based around an actual friend's life -- Allan Bloom, a professor at Chicago who died young -- doesn't disappoint on any count you can expect from a classy piece of writing.<br />A richly textured brush that looks at humanity, love, relationships has been a Bellow forte since I've known his work (&quot;Something to remember me by&quot; being my personal all time favorite) and in the case of this novel his passions coincide with his friend's. Several events that are known to have occured in reality are chronicled with the typical Bellow flair.<br />A couple of minor caveats before you set out...<br />One, for long stretches of the novel, Bellow relies on the reflected glory of his and Bloom's real-life fame to lend the novel light and heat...a somewhat tricky strategy that is occasionally a let down.<br />Second, the last one-third of the book (after Ravelstein, Bloom's character and the eponymous protagonist, passes away) is a little self-indulgent and slow paced while we are basically left with Chick's (Bellow's) ruminations about all and sundry.<br />Still, I recommend these 233 pages as a decent summer read. If you read Bellow for plot twists and cliff hanger suspense, you are reading the wrong guy anyway. What makes this book or any of his other works tick is his simple yet deeply moving looks at the biology of our lives and relationships under the prying lens of a writer who redefined the turn of a phrase.	2003-07-22

The peasants who found the manuscripts feared that it might house something occultish but hoped it contained gold. They were of course disappointed with the contents, some of which they destroyed and some of which they sold off. These Coptic documents, at par with the discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls in their informational value, contained secret and deviant versions of early Christian teaching. As it were, commercial greed and academic rivalry ensured that it took a long time for the manuscripts to reach professional scholars.<br />This new book is a lucid compilation of personal perspectives of Pagels, and hence a lot more opinionated than Gnostic Gospels. She furthers her dissection of the Nag Hammadi text and its relevance to modern Christianity. It is no mystery that she is enamoured with the views of Thomas, which have been overlooked in the favor of St. John's Gospel. And this is where the crux of this book lies -- in setting up a polite contrast between the ideologies of John and Thomas, and what could have been the face(s) of Christianity had these opposing views not been smudged by Iranaeus.<br />The Nag Hammadi evidence seems to challenge several by-now established notions. For instance, it denies the physical resurrection. To Mark and his acolytes (Matthew and Luke) Jesus was not a god but a messiah in the Jewish tradition -- a human being. In John's discordant views though, His existence was wholly distinct from that of ordinary humans.<br />Yet, Thomas failed, and John prevailed. Thanks in no small part to Iranaeus who in fact provided \\"the basic architecture of what would become orthodox Christianity\\". In the fourth century the emperor Constantine adopted Christianity, endorsed a creed to which all must subscribe and issued edicts against heretics and schismatics. Now the \\"Catholic\\" position had an imperial warrant; there was no salvation outside the church, which alone knew the \\"truth\\" and had the power to purge error.<br />PS: such bigoted tweaking of religion as a conduit to power is the reality of pretty much every religion, not just Christianity.<br />I found it refreshing that contrary to what the general populace is brainwashed into growing up with these days, the earliest years of Christianity actually sported several dissident doctrines of knowledge -- some worshiped God as both Father and Mother, others went in for sacred dancing, others proposed heterodox interpretations of baptism, and so on.<br />This message, supported with evidence both old (as in the exhaustive analysis of Nag Hammadi, reason enough to grab this book now!) as well as new (e.g., the proliferation of the \\"new forms\\" that Christianity is taking in Africa, America, Korea, China), is pretty simple -- we cannot and indeed should not be reconciled to churches (translation: religious institutions) that claim sole access to the truth of doctrine and discipline.<br />If that seems too esoteric for your tastes, this book is still a fabulous read for the layman language with which the ancient evidence of Nag Hammadi scrolls and an intimate knowledge of religious history are discussed.l warrant; there was no salvation outside the church, which alone knew the \\"truth\\" and had the power to purge error.<br />PS: such bigoted tweaking of religion as a conduit to power is the reality of pretty much every religion, not just Christianity.<br />I found it refreshing that contrary to what the general populace is brainwashed into growing up with these days, the earliest years of Christianity actually sported several dissident doctrines of knowledge -- some worshiped God as both Father and Mother, others went in for sacred dancing, others proposed heterodox interpretations of baptism, and so on.<br />This message, supported with evidence both old (as in the exhaustive analysis of Nag Hammadi, reason enough to grab this book now!) as well as new (e.g., the proliferation of the \\"new forms\\" that Christianity is taking in Africa, America, Korea, China), is pretty simple -- we cannot and indeed should not be reconciled to churches (translation: religious institutions) that claim sole access to the truth of doctrine and discipline.<br />If that seems too esoteric for your tastes, this book is still a fabulous read for the layman language with which the ancient evidence of Nag Hammadi scrolls and an intimate knowledge of religious history are discussed.	2003-07-22

All those deliciously subcutaneous elements of prose are as evident in this collection of over a dozen stories as in any of his longer novels.<br />Geographically, many of them are based in Tokyo, but it might be any of the world's vast unforgiving cities where people get lost like tears in the rain and finding love is sometimes as hard as solving Rubik's cube in the dark. Reading Murakami is an unsettling, disorienting experience that can leave you feeling rather empty, but always somehow thoughtful.<br />Minor gripe: my favorite translator of Murakami's work is Jay Rubin and I am certain that under his watchful pen the stories would have more closely resembled the verve of their originals (in Japanese).<br />Nonetheless, if you have never read Murakami before, this marvellous collection is a great way to start in manageable dollops of his style. And if you are familiar with the author's dour tracts, this book should be an unmissable little something to relish on a sunny Sunday afternoon.	2003-07-21

I recall reading an article in HBR that questioned the efficacy of traditional advertising and the humongous marketing budgets that are allocated to it. Pick up the book \\"HBR on Brand Management\\" and indeed the first case study addresses this issue. It _is_ a very pertinent, timely and important question: how to allocate your budgets across the different forms of marketing touchpoints? And there's ample evidence to show how media other than advertising lead to the phenomenal success of products.<br />Carrie Bradshaw, the protagonist of the hot HBO show \\"Sex And The City\\" spends more than she can afford from her journalist salary on Hermes Birkin bags and the whole world sends the brand (a simple bag for god's sake) into a waiting list of not weeks, not months, but 3 years! Michael Moore decides that he doesn't have the budget to market his next fabrication (\\"Stupid White Men\\") so he cultivates a clever little following through the use of online channels. A \\"big3\\" US automotive manufacturer creates a frenzy for its new product launch through a kiosk placed in a popular spot at Disney World and with a clever unprecedented campaign. Prada launches a classic architectural marvel of a store in NY and then gets a zillion journalists to write about it in business magazines, NYT, fashion magazines, architectural publications etc.<br />The common theme underpinning the success of these initiatives is that these novel marketing ideas, or PR, are inherently credible because consumers KNOW that the product's endorsement does not come from its vendor but from \\"trusted\\" third-party mavens in the society. Advertising on the other hand suffers from an intrinsic bias of hawking one's wares.<br />That, to me, is the crux of this all-too-important argument and the one that Ries & Ries intended to veer their book around.<br />HOWEVER, I am sorry to say that their endeavour is a mediocre one at best as they try to wrap a blanket around the question and suggest that ONLY public relations is the cassandra call that marketers need to heed. Doesn't tickle my fancies, sorry. The truth is not black or white. If Sony gives up all advertising and relies ONLY on creative little PR ideas to do ALL its marketing, it is anyone's guess what will happen to it in the medium to long run. It smacks of intellectual dishonesty to cite examples of doozy advertising campaigns such as the one from pets.com -- and conveniently skipping the pitfalls of unsuccessful PR -- to grind their one-sided axe. Doesn't really help their case that PR is not really \\"this new marketing strategy\\", it has just been used creatively by the examples they impose on the readers.<br />But this logical fallacy aside, the book also disappoints against the litmus of purely a decent casual read. Several cliches line the text (\\"sky's the limit\\", \\"throw gasoline on fire\\"), as do unbelievable exaggerations (\\"Every brand that got to the top got there through PR\\" -- I dont think so, sorry).<br />For a much more succint yet compelling treatment of this subject, I recommend the first chapter of the book \\"HBR on Brand Management\\" which talks about media allocations.

The woman's fiance asks his uncle, disabled police detective Shunsuke Honma, to track her down. What he uncovers suggests the missing woman had been living under an assumed identity of another deceased woman.<br />What follows is an ingenious yet somewhat murky murder mystery about the search for a woman on the run; come to think of it, it is a search for two women, one running and one not.<br />I've read Japanese authors translated before (Murakami, for instance) but this was my first Japanese suspense novel. I'll be subtle and say that this is a fabulous and riveting thriller! And take it from someone in Tokyo: as a bonus, you also get a very accurate tour of contemporary Japan and the consumer culture that preys upon the individuals and society that created it.<br />One of the most compelling faces of detective fiction is the notion that the culprit leaves behind a trail of clues to his past, however hard he may have tried to erase that trail. That is the heart of this novel. The fact that in the past an individual in Japan was defined by his or her place in the family, and that now citizens have a residence certificate as proof of identity. That, coupled with the legal requirement that children are responsible for their parents' debts. One common way out is personal bankruptcy; our protagonist in the novel chooses to escape by assuming an entirely different inidividual's identity.<br />It is rather fitting then that the novel should be set in a society like modern day Japan's, where escaping an unhappy past may well be considered to be the ultimate crime.	2003-07-21

Eleven such superstar companies are singled out according to 5 years worth of research -- Abbot Labs, Circuit City, Fannie Mae, Gillette, Kimberly-Clark, Kroger, Nucor, Philip Morris, Pitney Bowes, Walgreens, and Wells Fargo -- on the basis of 15-year stock returns. <br />Which is one metric. It may be instructive to note that Gillette, one of the Great firms, is trading at the same stock price as it was in 1995, and went through a pretty lame patch of 4-5 years just recently until it was saved by a doyen CEO. Wells Fargo, despite its Norwest acquisition still remains no.5 in its category. <br />We are offered the following insights about most effective leaders: <br />- Best leaders are not high profile folk but subdued, humble yet focused people who get results. Sure, but same could also be said of the oppposite personality. Examples of vivacious/outspoken yet successful CEOs abound: Lee Iacocca, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Jack Welch etc.<br />- Great leaders are supposed to believe in teamwork (Nokia's boss, Jorma Ollila, and his preachings of putting teamwork before individual effort are cited). Excuse me if this hackneyed mantra fails to tickle my fancies. <br />Apart from the above insightful analysis, we are taken through a whole text of redundant spin on how companies need to focus on their \\"key profitability ratio\\" and hone it down to succeed. Advice of this nature that asks companies to focus sounds quite ordinary and unimaginative, so a parable from Aesop's Fables is thrown in -- the \\"HedgeHog versus Fox\\" -- a hedgehog knows ONE thing well and excels at it, while a fox runs around seeking many targets but never learns. We should of course be like the hedgehog.<br />Firstly, this swansong of \\"focus\\" is painfully cliche. Secondly, it assumes that business context is stagnant, which is anything but the reality. What happens when Kentucky Fried Chicken runs out of favor with a populace that is becoming health conscious? Or, what happens when a new generation requires MORE than one type of jeans? (This put Levis into its deep market share woes as recently as the late 90s while Lee Cooper and Calvin Klein made significant inroads into the teen denim markets, Levis was caught sleeping with its errant strategy to focus on its 501s).<br />I have difficulty believing that the book stands up to all its rave reviews. At best, this is just ONE perspective about SOME companies based on ONE statistic, the data for which were collected and analyzed POST-HOC (known as \\"posthoc bias\\" to those in the know). If you are expecting to come away with any pearls of wisdom about effective leadership or corporate success, you may be disappointed.	2003-07-21

Distraught at what becomes a small but life-changing incident, she rebuilds herself and her life (and btw, her health, her wardrobe, her career) inspired and guided by the chic advise of Madame Dariaux. Except that she makes mistakes, gets things going topsy turvy, and has to improvise and update the advice she is so carefully living by.<br />However, despite the somewhat annoyingly effeminate quirks of preening and primping, the very Vogue flair of writing, the tried and tested (ok, \\"hackneyed\\") theme of good old fashioned love gone awry, the somewhat predictable setting of - ahem - London, and even a gay best friend for our protagonist Louie, which apparently is an essential accessory for the modern woman...this novel is actually quite a page turner.<br />The style of writing, as I mentioned, is very Magazine. A clear break from too much dense literature on the subject of dour romances. In its accurate potrayal of a woman's psyche, especially at an age when it is somewhat late to be making self-discoveries, the novel smacks of the class of Nick Hornby's \\"How to be good\\". The characters are very well developed without getting too prosaic, you will end up liking almost everyone (even the errant husband who was at the root of all grief).<br />A quick-paced romp through the vagaries of high-soc life in London. With, as you probably imagined, a happy ending.	2003-07-19

It is crisp and entertaining, and whatever little math is mentioned is easily comprehensible by average Joe and his dog. But due to its size, the book merely scratches the surface of Newton's illustrious life and ideas. Nothing is mentioned for example about his part time alchemy experiments that make him look not as scientific as his image would have people believe.<br />As an introduction, or a starting point for someone curious about the legendary scientist, this book hits the mark very well.

As the novel opens, 57 men, 18 terrorists and one remarkable opera soprano (Roxanne Coss) begin their new life behind the closed doors of the vice presidential mansion, in a surprise guerrila coup.<br />The government of a small South American country was holding a birthday party for the head of Japan's leading electronics manufacturer, hoping to attract its business. Mr. Hosokawa, they know, can't resist the opportunity of a private performance by Ms. Coss. But it's not Hosokawa or Coss the terrorists want -- they were after the country's president. Unfortunately, they quickly learn that he skipped the soiree to watch his favorite soap opera. Upon successfully storming the building, the rebels find their kidnapping attempt foiled, and they don't know what to do.<br />The plot is engrossing, and Patchett's pen is eloquent in many moments. The mild relationship that develops between the Japanese businessman and the soprano, despite the lack of a common vocabulary, is interesting. Yes, there are issues with the novel. The characters are somewhat cardboard although we are pointed to everyone's good sides. The resolution to the predicament itself, though supposedly hinged on an actual event, is specious at best.<br />Yet, Bel Canto is high on my recommendation list because of the variety of grounds it manages to cover with a very readable summer treat -- art/music, the quagmire of politics, love that transcends geographic boundaries and trappings, Red Cross negotiations, fear, rebellion. Patchett makes it happen.<br />This isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of review, but not every thing that comes highly recommended need be one.	2003-07-19

NO, TIPPING POINT	Some voracious reading of research on...<br />(1) &quot;Network externalities&quot; and &quot;network effects&quot; from economics and<br />(2) WOM (word of mouth) research from social/cognitive psychology<br />...and shamelessly rehashing them with a doozy touchy-feely spin on &quot;small things can inspire big things&quot; a la &quot;Pay it Forward&quot; (that Helen Hunt/Kevin Spacey rigmarole) -- and lo and behold, you have a tipping point for a book that people are stomping over each other to buy and magically provoke their thinking about marketing or sociological phenomena.<br />Indeed every once in a while we need a business book that summarizes and makes sense of all that goes on in academia, so even such blatant intellectual debauchery would be fine as long as the BASIC professional integrity of attribution was upheld. The very least one can expect from such a self-proclaimed &quot;biography of an idea&quot; endeavour is an honest acknowledgement of WHERE the idea came from.<br />As though it was not embarrassing enough that epithets like &quot;maven&quot; and &quot;connector&quot; are well established in WOM or network externality research since nearly 20 years, we were also fed with the MOST commonly used illustrations -- faxes becoming important because other people had faxes, or some quaint fashion catching up overnight (Hush Puppies in this case, but it could be any number of things), or how broadband has swept our world, or the success of a TV show -- these are all primetime textbook examples to explain the very fundamental concepts of network externality in ECON 101. Some arcane mention of epidemiologists' theories does not count because the whole hypothesis here is to provide something that is &quot;beyond the world of medicine and diseases&quot;. Not one mention of the &quot;Network Externality&quot; in the book or in the glossary at the end.<br />To its minor credit, the book is written with a readable flow although expect to have each and every minutiae explained in a &quot;for dummies&quot; style. For e.g., the perfectly simple notion that yawning is visually and aurally contagious is explained over 2 pages of relatively small print with about 100 mentions of the word yawn. Yawn. Such excruciating fleshing out of material is understandable of course, given how little of substance there really was in this &quot;thinking&quot; to begin with.<br />The text wallows in its conflicting logical morass. Remember, &quot;small things&quot; are supposed to make a big difference. A winding 40 pages are devoted to crime combat in NY under a newly appointed police chief. Forgive me if this concerted annual effort by a legitimate full-fledged police force does NOT sound like a &quot;small thing&quot; to me.<br />We are told &quot;What must underlie successful epidemics is a bedrock belief that change is possible&quot;. Unfortunately, all the examples Gladwell cites such as a sweeping shoe vogue, faxes becoming popular -- these are all a matter of happenstance instead of a concerted effort by individuals at a point in time. Such is indeed the true nature of contagious phenomenons as he himself mentions at the outset, there is no &quot;bedrock belief&quot; until afterwards when someone sits and analyzes the event. I could also hypothesize that a lot of these mini-revolutions happen when an optimal chain of events is accidentally (unintentionally) spurred on by some triggers in society/environment etc, but that is for another day.<br />As though this were not enough we are treated to semi-pompous implications. For e.g., page 131: &quot;There is something PROFOUNDLY counter-intuitive in the definition of stickiness that emerges from all these examples&quot;. Really? Would have been nice if it were apparent instead of having us hit on the head with it.<br />Come to think of it a &quot;big effect&quot; is a pretty flaky/subjective concept anyway. How could this supposed big effect be sustained? Where are hush puppies now? As for NY's crime rate, many experts such as Andrew Karmen from CUNY (John Jay) believe that the drop in crime rates in NY in 1980s or 90s is insignificant, homicides in the city have risen 10-fold since 1950. How about faxes -- and their big effect being eaten by another big effect (email)?<br />What is most piquing though is that in a round-about way we are offered Polyanna solutions as a result of this 3-pronged theory of network externality. One priceless gem emerges when we are convinced how cleaning a subway system would be enough to solve crime rates (with the Bernie Goetz case as a lynchpin). My retorts won't fit this review.<br />Whether this is a legitimate business book or a mere avante-garde coffee table thoughtpiece, one would have at the least expected some sort of an organized framework to plan for these &quot;small things&quot; or to sustain the &quot;big effects&quot;. None is forthcoming. As for me, the very fact that well-established research is packaged here in a 250-page drawl as a pretentiously seminal idea is quite a put-off in itself. A simple 5-6 page HBR article would have done the job just fine, but then that wouldn't make a lot of money for Gladwell, would it.<br />If you are in business and hope to use this stuff for a spiral marketing/branding effort, you'd do a lot better getting your hands on some WOM literature than this inchoate theoretical indulgence.<br />Highly over-rated material, this.r NY's crime rate, many experts such as Andrew Karmen from CUNY (John Jay) believe that the drop in crime rates in NY in 1980s or 90s is insignificant, homicides in the city have risen 10-fold since 1950.

I can vouch for the efficiency of the program but there are caveats and I would advise against following ONLY this program.<br />For one thing, although the recommendations are quite interesting, I wouldn't hang my hopes solely on the &quot;glycemic index&quot; notion. Calories are still the bottom line for weight loss, imho, and you should perhaps watch out for calorie levels of what you eat.<br />Secondly, as other reviewers have already indicated, the SBD is not exactly seminal because of its striking resemblance to the Atkins program -- a low carb philosophy (though they position it as &quot;glycemic index&quot;, indirectly related to sucrose anyway). At the outset, we are told to keep away from bread, pasta, potatoes, fruit and most dairy products in the first couple of weeks. Then, in &quot;phase 2&quot; healthy carbs including most fruits, whole grains, eggs and dairy products are gradually reintroduced, but processed carbs such as bagels, cookies, cornflakes, regular pasta and rice cakes remain on the list of foods to avoid or eat rarely. This continues until you are close to your weight targets. Finally &quot;phase 3&quot; basically mirrors &quot;phase 2&quot;.<br />CAVEATS: could the reliance on eggs induce high cholestrol? Also, since the last two phases selectively skimp on certain fruits and veggies, one wonders if the fruit intake is well-rounded.<br />Thirdly, Agatson makes an implied promise of losing your belly tires first. Does this sound reasonable? I have still to come across some dieting plan that can isolate a body part in such a manner and shape it without exercise.<br />Fourthly, speaking of exercise, diet recommendations are all fine and dandy, but some mentions of exercise would make the plan more well-rounded and authentic. Only half a page is devoted to any physical activity.<br />Anyway, regardless of these minor gripes, this is an interesting program if you couple it with some physical activity as well.

The book was with me in the shower, on the train, during morning walks (which turned into morning sittings), even in smoke-filled Italian diners or the nondescript Chinese restaurant on my street corner.<br />David had his wife kidnapped and murdered 8 years ago in an incident that left him wounded in the head and left to drown. He didn't die. Did she? All his efforts to forget the event and get on with his life have been in vain, until one day, 8 years later, he receives a note saying &quot;Tell no one. Lets meet&quot; (or something to that effect). Well, was she dead? Why the shroud? Whats the danger? Actually, why had this happened in the first place? Who had dunit? What will &quot;they&quot; do next?<br />You'll find yourself skipping heart beats and short of breath. There'll be goose pimples and sleepless nights. And even then, the denouement is not cream puff Hollywood type settling of scores and everything coming clean. This is a marvel of the thriller genre, and I doubt Coben will re-visit this class again.<br />If nailbiting, riveting thrillers are your thing, get your hands on this book as soon as you can.

It explores commercial avarice and obsession with sham celebrity in the world of a fictional home shopping network.<br />Welcome to the troubled world of \\"Sellevision\\", America's premier retail broadcasting network. When Max Andrews, the much-loved and handsome (lonely and gay) host of Slumber Sunday Sundown accidentally exposes himself in front of sixty million kids and their parents during a \\"Toys for Tots\\" segment, Sellevision faces its first big scandal. As Max fails to find a job in television, another host, the popular and perky Peggy Jean Smythe, is receiving sinister emails about her appearance from a stalker. Popping pills and drinking heavily, she fails to notice that her husband is spending a lot of time with the very young babysitter who lives next door. Then there's Leigh, whose affair with Sellevision boss Howard Toast is going nowhere, until she exposes him on air; and Bebe, Sellevision's star host, who finds Mr. Right through the Internet ? if she can just stop her shopping addiction from taking over.<br />It is not merely the dysfunctional family of anchors that is subject to the author's satire, but perhaps the whole primping 15-minute culture of television as we know it in our world.<br />Truly hilarious, and a fast paced read. If this book's laconic humor works for you, try \\"Running with Scissors\\" as well, which is clearly an ever more mature and twice as hilarious Burroughs in top form.	2003-07-15

Who'd have thought that a book about a crooked-legged race horse  could be such a riveting page-turner!<br />Called &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, our &quot;runty&quot; horse was a neurotic, pathologically lazy also-ran in the louche world of horse racing. Yet, over a course of four years, its three unusual but ardent supporters (the spendthrift owner, a laconic trainer and a half-blind jockey) survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a written off liability into a national sports icon.<br />If you are unsure about the theme, about 5 pages into the book I guarantee you'll be over all such misgivings because the undercurrent of this story has a wide universal appeal -- triumph over adversity, undying love, trust, passion.<br />I reluctantly pull off one star because of the sports-journalist stylization of some of the prose, e.g., while describing the jockey -- &quot;Red Pollard was sinking downward through his life with the pendulous motion of a leaf falling through still air&quot;. A bit of such surface coating could have been polished to make the book somewhat leaner than its whopping 400 pages.<br />But a great book it still is, and a top recommendation from me for best friends this year.	2003-07-15

The romp through a middle-aged man's tryst with petty politics of an English department is a very interesting even hilarious one, and most of the snippy observations along the way are vintage Russo.<br />Hank, a liberal arts professor on the verge of being unseated from his department chair in the middle of a budgetary restructuring effort, is actually not a very likeable fellow at all. At sea with his alternatives, he declares that he will kill \\"a duck a day\\" from the pond on campus until he receives a budget from the administration. Clearly one of the most exciting things on an otherwise drab campus, this sets off a chain of events whose reverberation only serves to highlight just how pathetic and parochial the concerns of small-college liberal arts professors can get.<br />The narrative is fresh, multiple threads of Hank's life (including frequent flashbacks) intertwine to create the whole amusing predicatement, without stooping to the level of a typical situational comedy.<br />My only minor quibble with this book though is in its denouement, when Hank attempts to sum up all his eventful life's lessons. Your mileage may vary, but it appeared a little trifling to me.<br />However that is no reason to keep off this book, it is a fast and funny summer read and definitely worth your while if you are looking for an intelligent read that'll frequently make you laugh out loud.	2003-06-29

Afghanistan, as he recounts from his 20 month stint with the 'Soviet Union' army in the mid 80s, is a terrain strewn with land mines and deceitful soldiers who may smile during the day but point their bayonet at you in the dark. At the heart of the memoir is a deep undercurrent of betrayal, and not just the variety that came from his enemy -- the Afghan \\"Dushmans\\" (bandits).<br />With ah-ha clarity he also reveals the wool that the military-industrial complex pulls over the eyes of starry-eyed young soldiers. In his case, the Communist party had promised that they were building schools and planting trees in Afghanistan (not unlike the recent War on Terror) although the ulterior agendas could have had more to do with trafficking in gold, stones or drugs. Shortly after, in an Uzbekistan boot camp, he learnt that their real mandate was little more than to \\"defeat the enemy\\".<br />What follows is a memoir that does not come across as an embittered tirade on the futility of war or some such highfalutin agenda. It is a stark, honest, moving chronicle of the realities of war from the perspective of one soldier who lived to tell the tale. And for the text-averse, it is lush with pictures that even the biggest media channels have not managed (imho).<br />What makes the book such a compelling read though is the sheer honesty of some of the narrative. It is clear to me that the intent of this book was not to make a living off royalties but to say something that the author has obviously been deeply moved by. Incidentally, it is also very relevant to our world in general, not just within the context of his own battles.<br />A very satisfying addition to your stash. If you are interested in this book, I would also recommend an account of the Gulf war by a somewhat more irreverent American marine, \\"Jarhead\\".	2003-06-29

No this doesn't turn into a wild goose chase as it would in your typical detective novel. There are no ulterior motives, suspects and thrills. Indeed that wouldn't be possible because our little sleuth in this case is someone suffering from Asperger's syndrome.<br /><br />Instead, we are presented with the world, the \\"case\\" and life from his point of view. These simple yet feeling perspectives are riveting. For instance, the boy does not believe metaphors. Metaphors are a way of talking about things in a way that they aren't, so metaphors are basically lies -- you laughed your socks off, it's raining cats and dogs, you are the apple of my eye. Can an apple fit into an eye? At the heart of Christopher's predicament is betrayal. His mother leaves his father. His father betrays him. He simply says, \\"Why can't you love me? Why can't you be straight?\\"<br /><br />On one level our little detective is arrested but on another he is a more incisive observer than you or I. His dislike for lies about the events he is recounting and his aversion to emotionalizing his observations lend the story a stripped-down precision that enables the author to talk about the big issues of love, mortality, loss, betrayal without sounding contrived.<br /><br />Such a brilliant debut from Mark Haddon. I feared I would be treading on a tripwire of sympathy-bombs when I bought the book, but it's a moving fast-paced read with a very intriguing \\"plot\\" that is not burdened by finding proofs and criminals, but by rummaging in the absurdities and idiosyncrasies of our lives.<br /><br />Highly recommended, for almost anyone in your family who can read.	2003-06-28

The peasants who found the manuscripts feared that it might house something occultish but hoped it contained gold. They were of course disappointed with the contents, some of which they destroyed and some of which they sold off. These Coptic documents, at par with the discovery of Dead Sea Scrolls in their informational value, contained secret and deviant versions of early Christian teaching. As it were, commercial greed and academic rivalry ensured that it took a long time for the manuscripts to reach professional scholars.  <br />This new book is a lucid compilation of personal perspectives of Pagels, and hence a lot more opinionated than Gnostic Gospels. She furthers her dissection of the Nag Hammadi text and its relevance to modern Christianity. It is no mystery that she is enamoured with the views of Thomas, which have been overlooked in the favor of St. John's Gospel. And this is where the crux of this book lies -- in setting up a polite contrast between the ideologies of John and Thomas, and what could have been the face(s) of Christianity had these opposing views not been smudged by Iranaeus.<br />The Nag Hammadi evidence seems to challenge several by-now established notions. For instance, it denies the physical resurrection. To Mark and his acolytes (Matthew and Luke) Jesus was not a god but a messiah in the Jewish tradition -- a human being. In John's discordant views though, His existence was wholly distinct from that of ordinary humans. <br />Yet, Thomas failed, and John prevailed. Thanks in no small part to Iranaeus who in fact provided \\"the basic architecture of what would become orthodox Christianity\\". In the fourth century the emperor Constantine adopted Christianity, endorsed a creed to which all must subscribe and issued edicts against heretics and schismatics. Now the \\"Catholic\\" position had an imperial warrant; there was no salvation outside the church, which alone knew the \\"truth\\" and had the power to purge error.<br />PS: such bigoted tweaking of religion as a conduit to power is the reality of pretty much every religion, not just Christianity.<br />I found it refreshing that contrary to what the general populace is brainwashed into growing up with these days, the earliest years of Christianity actually sported several dissident doctrines of knowledge -- some worshiped God as both Father and Mother, others went in for sacred dancing, others proposed heterodox interpretations of baptism, and so on.<br />This message, supported with evidence both old (as in the exhaustive analysis of Nag Hammadi, reason enough to grab this book now!) as well as new (e.g., the proliferation of the \\"new forms\\" that Christianity is taking in Africa, America, Korea, China), is pretty simple -- we cannot and indeed should not be reconciled to churches (translation: religious institutions) that claim sole access to the truth of doctrine and discipline.<br />If that seems too esoteric for your tastes, this book is still a fabulous read for the layman language with which the ancient evidence of Nag Hammadi scrolls and an intimate knowledge of religious history are discussed.	2003-06-18

The pages of the book are of a modest size, covering 5 essays in double spaced text. Out of 142 pages, 30 are devoted to bibliography, notes and a slim glossary.  Then, about 10 pages are consumed by verbatim quotations from Chomsky. Out of the remaining 100 or so pages, some passages (such as Gujarat massacres) are reproduced across 2 or 3 essays in their entirety. If you finally take into account a bit of superfluous linguistic liberty that Ms. Roy frequently allows herself (for e.g., a healthy dollop of questions posed in an attempt to make the text evocative) this really could have been ONE longish essay instead of a book.<br />Ok. That said, assuming the size and the price are irrelevant to you, there is no doubt you'll find Roy in absolutely top form -- very eloquent and a vitriolic but well supported take on ethnic-oriented acts of violence in our world, regardless of whatever facile labels are put on it (\\"terrorism\\" or its risible counterpart \\"war on terrorism\\").<br />The first two essays address a lot of what is wrong with \\"modern\\" communally sensitive India. This includes a graphic exploration of the recent Gujarat violence and how religious fascists are ruining the secular fabric of the country. It is very useful for someone not in India to get this shameful chronology of events as they happened and how politicians like Modi and Bal Thackerey still wallow in pride over their self-indulgent shenanigans.<br />Gradually, her cannon points to a bigger adversary -- the US. We are taken around Vietnam, Guatemala, Coasta Rica, Ecuador, Brazil, Peru, Nicaragua, Panama, Mexico, Colombia. Clearly, Chomsky has been a big inspiration for the author and we are subjected to frequent Chomsky moments. But apart from the quirks of America's conflicting presidential regimes + CIA, discussions about corporate globalizations are also thrown in for good measure.<br />All in all, it is a fast-paced, provocative, summary read about many issues facing our world, particularly involving two of the countries that Ms. Roy seems to have attachments to -- India and US. But for someone who reads Chomsky himself, and follows Indian events through TOI or HT, this may not necessarily be required reading -- unless you relish Roy's literary acumen (as I do).<br />Hope this helps you decide whether this book needs be bought and owned.

NO, TIPPING POINT	Some voracious reading of research on...<br />(1) \\"Network externalities\\" from economics and<br />(2) WOM (word of mouth) research from social/cognitive psychology<br />...and shamelessly rehashing them with a doozy touchy-feely spin on \\"small things can inspire big things\\" a la \\"Pay it Forward\\" (that Helen Hunt/Kevin Spacey rigmarole) -- and lo and behold, you have a tipping point for a book that people are stomping over each other to buy and magically provoke their thinking about marketing or sociological phenomena.<br />Indeed every once in a while we need a business book that summarizes and makes sense of all that goes on in academia, so even such blatant intellectual debauchery would be fine as long as the BASIC professional integrity of attribution was upheld. The very least one can expect from such a self-proclaimed \\"biography of an idea\\" endeavour is an honest acknowledgement of WHERE the idea came from.<br />As though it was not embarrassing enough that epithets like \\"maven\\" and \\"connector\\" are well established in WOM or network externality research since nearly 20 years, we were also fed with the MOST commonly used illustrations -- faxes becoming important because other people had faxes, or some quaint fashion catching up overnight (Hush Puppies in this case, but it could be any number of things), or how broadband has swept our world, or the success of a TV show -- these are all primetime textbook examples to explain the very fundamental concepts of network externality in ECON 101. Some arcane mention of epidemiologists' theories does not count because the whole hypothesis here is to provide something that is \\"beyond the world of medicine and diseases\\". Not one mention of the \\"Network Externality\\" in the book or in the glossary at the end.<br />To its minor credit, the book is written with a readable flow although expect to have each and every minutiae explained in a \\"for dummies\\" style. For e.g., the perfectly simple notion that yawning is visually and aurally contagious is explained over 2 pages of relatively small print with about 100 mentions of the word yawn. Yawn. Such excruciating fleshing out of material is understandable of course, given how little of substance there really was in this \\"thinking\\" to begin with.<br />The text wallows in its conflicting logical morass. Remember, \\"small things\\" are supposed to make a big difference. A winding 40 pages are devoted to crime combat in NY under a newly appointed police chief. Forgive me if this concerted annual effort by a legitimate full-fledged police force does NOT sound like a \\"small thing\\" to me.<br />We are told \\"What must underlie successful epidemics is a bedrock belief that change is possible\\". Unfortunately, all the examples Gladwell cites such as a sweeping shoe vogue, faxes becoming popular -- these are all a matter of happenstance instead of a concerted effort by individuals at a point in time. Such is indeed the true nature of contagious phenomenons as he himself mentions at the outset, there is no \\"bedrock belief\\" until afterwards when someone sits and analyzes the event. I could also hypothesize that a lot of these mini-revolutions happen when an optimal chain of events is accidentally (unintentionally) spurred on by some triggers in society/environment etc, but that is for another day.<br />As though this were not enough we are treated to semi-pompous implications. For e.g., page 131: \\"There is something PROFOUNDLY counter-intuitive in the definition of stickiness that emerges from all these examples\\". Really? Would have been nice if it were apparent instead of having us hit on the head with it.<br />Come to think of it a \\"big effect\\" is a pretty flaky/subjective concept anyway. How could this supposed big effect be sustained? Where are hush puppies now? As for NY's crime rate, many experts such as Andrew Karmen from CUNY (John Jay) believe that the drop in crime rates in NY in 1980s or 90s is insignificant, homicides in the city have risen 10-foldsince 1950. How about faxes -- and their big effect being eaten by another big effect (email)?<br />What is most piquing though is that in a round-about way we are offered Polyanna solutions as a result of this 3-pronged theory of network externality. One priceless gem emerges when we are convinced how cleaning a subway system would be enough to solve crime rates (with the Bernie Goetz case as a lynchpin). My retorts won't fit this review.<br />Whether this is a legitimate business book or a mere avante-garde coffee table thoughtpiece, one would have at the least expected some sort of an organized framework to plan for these \\"small things\\" or to sustain the \\"big effects\\". None is forthcoming. As for me, the very fact that well-established research is packaged here in a 250-page drawl as a pretentiously seminal idea is quite a put-off in itself. A simple 5-6 page HBR article would have done the job just fine, but then that wouldn't make a lot of money for Gladwell, would it.<br />If you are in business and hope to use this stuff for a spiral marketing/branding effort, you'd do a lot better getting your hands on some WOM literature than this inchoate theoretical indulgence.<br />Highly over-rated material, this.since 1950.

The secret to the phenomenal success of these brands is the &quot;narrative&quot; that communicates the underlying brand philosophy, one that engages and inspires consumers to use and stay loyal to these &quot;legendary brands&quot;.<br />A slew of pages is devoted to theorizing about these brands' narrative structure and occasionally the pseudo-scientific verbiage is a little distracting (e.g., &quot;Brand mythology acts upon the cognitive orientation centers of the brain in much the same way that religion and other deeply held philosophical beliefs do&quot;).<br />Yet, all this could have been easily overlooked by the fastidious reader, but without a more organized analysis of how these seemingly facile narratives were conceived, attained, and then maintained by our &quot;legendary&quot; brands, the book falls short of its expectations.

Can we ever be sure if the title of this latest populist addition to Moore's anthology was in fact a self-reference?<br />Yet again, he gets a whole slew of his facts/chronology curiously distorted in support of doozy ideas (which is well documented throughout the reviews here, so I won't regurgitate) but what baffles even more is the priceless linguistic achievement of this effort. Expect to work through gems of journalism like \\"It is sooooooooo not cool\\" or through highly intellectual inferences such as \\"There is no recession, my friends. No downturn. No hard times. The rich are wallowing in the loot they've accumulated in the past two decades, and now they want to make sure you don't come a-lookin' for your piece of the pie.\\"<br />This isn't journalism, and it surely isn't satire (for that, get your hands on almost anything by O'Rourke, Dennis Miller or Buchwald).

Some of the best moments of the book emerge from her accounts of a \\"political wife\\" representing her husband and country while remaining civil and smiling even in sullen times like Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait.<br />By turns putatively formal and deliciously candid, LOF is overall a fascinating account of the eternal royal balancing act between what must certainly be a bafflingly public life versus carving out a personal one. Her journey from a Princeton graduate to a Middle Eastern urban planner to a Queen is probably what makes her profile so interesting to international folk.<br />On the political side, this is a biography from the eyes of one person, which is a reason not to read this as a political factbook but as a perspective. On the personal side, her vivid reminiscing of the first days as Queen are the stuff Audrey Hepburn movies are made of...awakening to the sound of jackhammers during palace renovations, disagreements with a valet over who was supposed to dress the king, and adjustments to her instant family.<br />In sum, a truly enjoyable keeper for your collection.	2003-06-11

Yet 911 is perhaps his biggest claim to fame (at least for most folks outside of NY) and he doesn't shy from capitalizing on this image - a major chunk of the floundering, rambling text in this book veers around the fortuitous event.<br />In a miscarried attempt to lead us into his softer side, we are told of how he scampered on the big day to have police protect both his wife and his mistress, worrying that he and his loved ones, past and present, might be targets. For one thing it's nothing to swoon about. For another, it betrays his solipsistic stance even in a time of national crisis. Let us not forget that this is the same man who behind this flaky NiceGuy veneer has a personal security staff of 16 police detectives, who cost more than $1 million per year and perform such vital tasks as driving Giuliani's fianc¨¦e to the Hamptons so she could water her flowers. Depressingly little of substance is mentioned of course of his attempts to ACTUALLY deal with the aftermath of 911 crises (how about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo or the police torture of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima for instance?)<br />As though such contrived, pulpy self-indulgence were not enough we are then showered with poppycock advice on \\"what constitutes leadership in our modern real world\\". Some pearls of wisdom --<br />(1) Have beliefs and communicate them.<br />(2) Surround yourself with strong, independent people.<br />(3) Don't micromanage or undermine the authority of the good people you've hired.<br />(4) See things for yourself.<br />(5) Set an example.<br />(6) Stand up to bullies.<br />(7) Deal with first things first.<br />(8) Loyalty is the vital virtue.<br />(9) Prepare relentlessly.<br />(10) Underpromise and overdeliver.<br />(11) Don't assume a damn thing<br />(12) Hire good people instead of yes-men<br />Thanks for the heads up, who'd've thought of that!<br />Makes one wonder if having his name in indecorously fine print on the cover was in fact an intentional move by Ken Kurson.

Creating and Capitalizing on the Best New Management Thinking	Books	4	6	6	N	N	HOW TO "EXECUTE" ON WHAT WE "KNOW"	Chances are you feel you've read books like this before. WHAT makes an idea work? WHO in an organization makes it work? WHY are idea practitioners not always rewarded or recognized? IS your organization stifling the flow of ideas or motivating ANYONE to come up with them?<br />Yet, veering around interviews with 100 or so actual idea practitioners, this offering from Davenport et al has a very specific thematic intent and does a fabulous job of it. Below are some thoughts that form the spine of this brilliant work --<br />(1) It is usually the same people who advance new business approaches at organizations. It's a whole class of people who have never been exalted to the status of high-profile business gurus (Porter, Tom Peters, Drucker, Hammer etc) despite being the ones to _actualize_ the ambitious ponderings of the Porters and Druckers of our world.<br />(2) And no, rarities like Jack Welch may be more of an exception than the rule. Most idea practitioners are not on a fast track to the corner office. Most of them believe that they could probably have done better within the company if they had instead focused their careers on power and responsibility.<br />(3) Yet, many of these people can't help themselves. They tend to gravitate to the jobs that have more intellectual content.<br />(4) It is the contribution of these folk that gives companies competitive edges in times of an economic slump or industry stagnation/maturation, or even an elevated \\"perceived\\" business performance resulting in improved shareholder value and morale.<br />(5) None of the above is conveyed in the form of fluffy business wisdom tripe. A smattering of examples from around the world support all the authors' theses -- failing K-Mart versus the expanding Walmart, the nearly bygone Westinghouse versus GE, Cemex in Mexico, Holcim in Switzerland etc.<br />(6) Finally, amidst the profiles of the idea practitioners the authors attempt to offer a framework to evaluate and execute ideas. As for evaluation, they recommend running the idea through the litmus of the CLASSIC THREE of strategy (Efficiency, Effectiveness and Innovation). This does not come off as altogether fresh although the suggested framework is useful. As for execution, we are left more or less with the interviews and the thoughts therein.<br />Overall, I'd say this is an engrossing book and the actual success stories are inspiring (perhaps a decent springboard for ideas too). The organization of the content could have been a little bit better but you don't have to be a true believer in the power of management ideas to appreciate the value of this book in our management thinking driven times.<br />An important, interesting read.aluation, they recommend running the idea through the litmus of the CLASSIC THREE of strategy (Efficiency, Effectiveness and Innovation).

Sounds promising, though the theme is not exactly avant-garde...Brandenburger/Nalebuff covered this is in \\"Co-opetition\\" much more eloquently as long back as 1997.<br />A discomfortingly large chunk of the book is devoted to drilling the already established business dictum that collaboration, i.e., \\"a company's alignment of its business activities and processes with other organizations to create shared value and manage shared risk\\", is not merely a TACTICAL way of enhancing value or efficiency but is rapidly becoming a STRATEGIC necessity for the continual innovation needed to exploit fast-paced yet fleeting business opportunities.<br />Is it just me, or haven't we known this for what, 10 years now? This part of the book appeared to have been freeze-dried into place and was about as exciting to read as an ice tray.<br />Fortunately, the book soon picks up as the authors point out how collaboration, while critical for competitive relevance, is potentially risky and a pain in the rear to actually manage. Executives must evaluate the choice of partners, the form of the collaboration, the expected rewards, the possible risks, and the implications for personnel, operations and technology. In addition to explaining the underlying dynamics of collaboration, the book provides frameworks and diagnostics for the strategic and operational decision-making needed to effectively exploit the collaborative imperative.<br />And in this, it excels. What's more, it brims with some fascinating real-world case studies, arguably the most ambrosial of prose in any business book, and the authors cast a wide net too -- UBS, Cisco, U.S. Department of Defense Advanced Projects Research Agency Network, the Global Straight Through Processing Association (GSTPA) etc.<br />Overall, a mild to medium recommendation that may just be worth your time if you are involved in collaborative operational work. If you are really serious or care about the strategic perspectives of collaborations, you may also want to take a look at \\"Co-opetition\\" or more recently \\"The Support Economy\\" -- both trailblazers in their own right.rious or care about the strategic perspectives of collaborations, you may also want to take a look at \\"Co-opetition\\" or more recently \\"The Support Economy\\" -- both trailblazers in their own right.	2003-06-08

In the case of Gandhi, it is absolutely a breeze for anyone willing to look (*willing* being the operative word).<br />PERSONAL LIFE AND BELIEFS. Little do people know about his sheer disregard for his family amid his soaring popularity (the pretext of course being the usual: Nation comes first), a topic that has been discussed at length by his grandchildren in several plays over the last few years in India, all of which happened to be \\"controversial\\". This is a man who let Kasturba (his wife) die of pneumonia when she could have been saved with a shot of (British) penicillin, on the grounds of it being an \\"alien medicine\\". All this would have been high and exalted but it must be noted that when he himself contracted malaria shortly afterward he accepted for himself the alien medicine Quinine, and that when he had appendicitis he allowed British doctors to perform on him the alien outrage of an appendectomy.<br />SOCIAL LIFE: Little do people know (ok, people in the know know of this one) of his sleeping with pretty teenage girl followers in the buff in the \\"ashram\\" who cuddled the nude septuagenarian in their arms. Pretext: he was \\"testing\\" his vow of chastity in order to gain moral strength for his mighty struggle with Jinnah. Meanwhile, his daily morning greeting to his women followers in the morning was \\"Have you had a good bowel movement this morning, sisters?\\"<br />POLITICAL LIFE: Little needs to be said in this department. Try holding anyone else accountable for the morbid massacre of 20,000 or so innocent lives that occured during partition (and countless more since, as Pakistan and India remain at constant loggerheads). His nepotistic support for Nehru (who doted in return of course while being totally useless in any other manner) affected India even after his death as Sardar Vallabhai Patel was pretty much relegated to the backdrop of Nehru's cambridge-motivated Fabian ideas. And as far as the sublime message of non-violence goes, it is instructive to stop for a moment and think how Gandhi would have done under an antagonist like Hitler. He was lucky to be left alive, which speaks volumes about British rule. In the kind of civil disobedience he advocated, several people lost their lives haplessly facing a storm of bullets from the British hoping they were martyrs (e.g., Jallianwalla Bagh).<br />Anyway, whatever vein you wish to study Gandhi's persona/convictions in, and I mean study instead of reading the myriad paeans sung to the great Father Of The Nation, the one glaring defining feature of his character turns out to be his dogged obsession with his own preachings of simplicity (which are all great, unless imposed, as done under him) and his egregious notions of sanctity that came from renunciation of anything not indigenously produced in India (Civil Disobedience). This theorem was not much more than a gutless pandering to the agro-based masses of India, and arguably something that have long since affected India's wishes to stand back on its feet with global collaborations. He was a man who clearly revelled in the throes of his saintification at the expense of everything else, but to his credit and gain, sported topnotch interpersonal skills and a very smart agenda at a very right time. In short, \\"celebrity material\\".<br />If you find any of this inappropriate, you may want to keep away from the book, it will show you pages of history that are buried under the GreatGandhi rubble. It is sad, and somewhat symptomatic of the herd-belief systems that most people WISH to maintain, that this book is labeled \\"Out of print/Low availability\\".far as the sublime message of non-violence goes, it is instructive to stop for a moment and think how Gandhi would have done under an antagonist like Hitler.

Either one ends up savagely dismissing him as a petty caviller, or extolling his brand of &quot;eye opening&quot; wisdom. I doubt I can add anything purposeful to this seemingly hot debate because I approached this book with a different intent altogether.<br />I wanted this page of history to answer some of my business questions. How America came from a nowhere nation of vagrant Arawak Indian tribes just a few centuries ago to being a commerical (ok, and imperial) superpower in our times. My interest was not to equip myself with geewhiz anti-US trivia (although I picked up a fair bit on the way, tra la) but to answer the atavistic question of what promoted capitalistic thinking, meritocracy, love of freedom etc in the United states more than the rest of the planet (assuming this is true in the first place).<br />And in that department, I have to say that this book left me startled. It might sound presumptuous but the quick answer is that there is nothing specific in the history or the anthropological station of US in this century and the last that may have accentuated its drive for capitalism. What's more, America was and is, just like any other country on the planet, subject to the exact same vagaries of civilization/humanity/bigotry/dogma that make and mar an empire every few centuries or so. I also recognize why this is very difficult for Americans to identify with or agree to, specially Americans who typify the inward looking solipsism of the current generation and perhaps the last 2 or so.<br />I recommend this book highly as a VIEW of historical events that are difficult to deny occured. Whether the guardians of the old order spring into an attack or not this is bound to yank a lot of people (me included) out of a langour of perspective.<br />Not all books need to be read to be &quot;liked&quot;.

The idea is not simply to discover WHAT we know, but to find out HOW we know it. How do we know what is in the center of the earth, thousands of miles beneath the surface? How can we know the extent and the composition of the universe, or what a black hole is? How can we know where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out?<br />Even if Bryson's verbal capers were left out, the theme itself is enough to get me listening. But the way it is written, the sheer scope of what it covers, and the contagious honesty with which it looks at the universe it unfolds -- this is yet another priceless<br />offering from Bryson.<br />Whether you are looking for a quick conduit to Intelligence in 24 Hours, or an entertaining colloquial peep into the otherwise close-chested world of high science, this is an invaluable gem for your stash!

I confess to having read only the last 3 of Connelly's novels, but for the first time we get to see Harry the person instead of Harry the detective. This lends a certain credibility and authenticity to the character as a flesh and blood mortal who ages and is subject to the same natural laws of living as everyone else.<br />Despite this somewhat \\"soft\\" brush, Connelly's adroit strokes do not detract Lost Light from his trademark breakneck pace, with the murder's implications expanding the investigation far and wide, possibly implicating police corruption, FBI conspiracy, and international terrorism. Which makes for an unpredictable, irreverent, suspenseful ripper of a read.<br />Expect nothing less from Connelly, clearly a contemporary master of his genre (along with Herb Cohen in my book). Lost Light is easily an excellent follow-up to an exceptionally fine series. And if you thought City of Bones concluded with a shock, wait for the final twist in this one!	2003-05-22

This is most certainly not only a book about negotiation, it is for anyone interested in a gripping read about human psychology and our subconscious response to external stimuli. An interesting example:  if you are at a party and you begin talking with a member of the opposite sex whom you find moderately attractive, it is very likely that your initial assessment of this person will decrease when a \\"beautiful\\" girl or guy ambles over to join the conversation. Obviously the first person did not morph into someone physically different, but did become comparatively less appealing when smothered in the shadow cast by the \\"beautiful\\" person.<br />While \\"Getting to Yes\\" and \\"You can negotiate anything\\" were flush with such interesting real-life nuggets and the best on offer in their time, \\"Influence\\" would rate as my personal favorite that conceptually digs deep into the art of persuation.<br />For one thing, Cialdini's writing style is entertaining and exudes common sense. Which makes it worth the ride for just about anyone interested in an intelligent read. I'd even venture to say that he comes across as accessible as Thomas Schelling (\\"Strategy of Conflict\\", \\"Choice and Consequence\\") in the kinds of intuitive but compelling examples that he uses to illustrate his points.<br />For another, this is one of the rare books that explain the *psychology* of WHY and HOW human beings/animals respond the way they do. What is different about his hypotheses? Cialdini breaks down his analysis into 6 broad principles consciously or subconsciously employed by people to persuade their counterparts (consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity) and then discusses each of these principles in term of its ability to elicit \\"automatic, mindless compliance\\" from us. And if you do not feel that simply being aware of such compliance tactics is defense enough, he goes on to offer useful, practical  shields in a scattering of sections such as \\"How to Say No\\".<br />This is an incredibly useful book that one can only hope does not fall into the hands of one's adversary. Clearly required reading for anyone involved in the business of persuasion (marketing/sales, diplomacy, strategy etc) and highly recommended for everyone else.his is an incredibly useful book that one can only hope does not fall into the hands of one's adversary.

First, those who came here looking for some fodder to support their own convictions about why the war was necessary or at least inevitable. The second, those anti-war aficianodos who believe that the \\"shock and awe\\" raid into Iraq was neither of the above, but were referred by friends who disagreed to read this book.<br />I'll fess up that I belong to the second 'clique', that I read Chomsky and Eqbal Ahmed more than daily tabloids, and that I am by now armed with a ton of examples/evidence of why US' foreign policy over the course of last 3 decades has been nothing short of shabby, inconsistent and in fact (eventually) self-hurting.<br />But this is a tireless debate, and we are not the first ones to hit upon it. Pollack's effort, in case you did not notice, is JUST A BOOK. Even though I believe that countering terrorism effectively would call for smarter strategies than war, strategies that Bush Inc seems to be happy in overlooking, The Threatening Storm still remains one of the BEST works out there with which to temper my anti-war sentiments.<br />Instead of bickering about my opinions pro or anti war, I'd still recommend someone seriously interested in this atavistic debate to read this book. Ideally, with an open mind. If there was a sequel to this book, a sort of \\"Part 2 - The AfterMath\\" which I believe should almost be mandatory, I would scamper to grab that too.	2003-05-20

Even if you search for the words \\"DVD demystified\\" it turns up a whole slew of immediately relevant websites (on almost all search engines).<br />That said, it is a fantastic book that doesn't gloat over the merits of DVD versus older discs, or the engineering nitty gritty of the whole format.

And then there is poetry that is, well, not poetry at all but smart, beautiful, delectable ideas expressed more vertically than prose -- a real man's real thoughts about real things that almost any one of us can relate to and savour.<br />It is this last genre of poetry that I would get myself to review, and Billy Collins is among the best of such contemporary poets-- sharp, witty, satirical, misleadingly simple but frequently flirting with meanings that deeply touch even the most ordinary among us, and without fail, an absolute thrill to read.<br />What sheer pleasure then to see a master in top form. In this little compendium his words are spare and casual as usual, holding us riveted by the force of what is articulated but not necessarily spoken.

A more intricate level of detail about the Sepoy mutiny and its lack of any highfalutin weaponry is mostly lost.<br />That a Brit would capture that time so vividly and with such insouciant wit is staggering. Between Farrell's \\"Troubles\\" (about Irish liberation struggles) and this book I am convinced that his historical backdrops should be required reading in schools.<br />The premise of this novel is simple: during a time of the Sepoy \\"siege\\", the idiosynchrasies of the English colonialists in Residence remain as quirky as ever -- a risibly uppetty \\"expat\\" attitude that is shown to have made the mutiny inevitable in the first place. Yet, Farrell's brits are not card-board characterizations of arrogance but more akin to oddball misfits in the wrong place at the wrong time. For instance, reports of unrest in Barrackpur, a sepoy mutiny in Berhampur, and unforeseen problems in Meerut create a sense of unease for the reader, but in the carefree hedonistic confines of the colony, \\"There was no cause for alarm and, besides, now that everyone had finished eating, a game of blind man's bluff was being called for.\\"<br />Note that unlike the impressions of some other reviewers, the author does not need to overindulge in racial parallels between the Indians and the British. His characters are too busy making fools of themselves in their own Residence. Which makes it harmless humor, for those who are sensitive to such things.<br />I own a second-hand, badly mutilated copy of this little novelette, purchased from a ubiquitous warehouse mart in Mumbai for Rs. 15 (about 25 US cents).

But this slim, easy read may actually connect with almost any business person. More so if you are in any way related to customer services or marketing.<br />Without skipping any beat on chapters of glorious prose, ala TypicalBusinessBook, it shoots straight from the gut about the tenets of Marriott -- how with sheer determination it shot to the big league from a small cottage inn, the MBE leadership style of Marriott (the younger Marriott that is) who prefers to walk his troops instead of boardroom inertia, lessons in team building, the importance of listening to all the levels of the organization, codifying past experiences into business philosophies (not the usual \\"Best Practices\\" bromide that is bandied about in elite echelons of business) etc etc.<br />In all respects, a hidden business gem of a book.<br />Now the million (ok, 11) dollar question.

Domestically, it lays bare the limits of the coercive power of the Chinese regime. Externally, it reveals just how creative Beijing's diplomacy can be. And strategically, it shows that China can nimbly -- and successfully -- appeal to common challenges as the basis for cooperation with countries that might normally see it as a potential threat.<br />Techno-Warriors is indeed a multidimensional book traversing defence, technology, economics and governance, but somewhat lacking (imho) in a coherent effort to string together all these different pontifications into a vision for the future of how Feigenbaum believes China will handle the issues he sets out to discuss.<br />A similar theme has also been addressed in \\"The New Chinese Empire\\" -- a book that encompasses the last 2000 years of Chinese history and how the posturings of several governments of the past in fact provide a common underpinning for Chinese governance in the present: thriving on weaknesses.<br />A reading of both these books in succession has left me thinking from a very fresh perspective about modern Chinese policy, particularly in contrast to the hackneyed economic odes found in popular media.<br />You are quite likely to find this a thoughtful, thought-provoking read, despite the demanding intellectual summons (which I take off one star for).ommon underpinning for Chinese governance in the present: thriving on weaknesses.<br />A reading of both these books in succession has left me thinking from a very fresh perspective about modern Chinese policy, particularly in contrast to the hackneyed economic odes found in popular media.<br />You are quite likely to find this a thoughtful, thought-provoking read, despite the demanding intellectual summons (which I take off one star for).	2003-05-16

I was a little skeptical of this book's relevance to me and my work given the (somewhat misleading) subtitle of \\"What it means for the US\\". Don't pay too much attention to it. As is anyone's guess almost anything written about China is most likely relevant to everyone in business.<br />While most news publications choose to focus on China's Global-Sweatshop status or its enviable FDI levels in the past decade or so, a recent spate of authors have also picked up the counter-theory cudgels to dispel all such quickfooted \\"China is the next superpower\\" myths. Notable among these are Chang's best selling \\"The Coming Collapse of China\\" or Cheff's \\"China Dawn\\" that raised some interesting flags about the cracks in the Chinese scaffolding.<br />So the overall theme of this book is not a big seminal surprise. We have seen and heard this before -- an onerous finger being pointed squarely at China's somewhat defunct cloak-and-dagger posturing towards information control and political rule.<br />But where Terrill's work stands out and becomes a compelling addition to your China related stash is his fabulous coverage of the last 2000 years of Chinese history and how it relates to the nation's policies in the present. Among the symptoms that the Chinese regime is \\"dysfunctional in the world of nation-states\\" is its clinging to the ways of empire. Over the years, China has used its imperial good times to grab neighboring territories including Yunnan, Tibet and Xinjiang. During periods of weakness, Chinese strategy has tended to be \\"Let us bide our time, and disguise frailty as power\\". To awe their subjects, for instance, the mandarin emperors falsely maintained that leaders ranging from Britain's King George III to the Mughal Tamerlane were paying tribute to them.<br />The author contends that even today the state continues to turn weakness into strength in a similar fashion -- by convincing the world that in both business and diplomacy it needs China more than China needs the world -- thus remaining an \\"empire of theatre and presumption,\\" a nation that is \\"deeply corrupt, politically unstable, yet extremely ambitious.\\"<br />This politically charged analysis is IMHO a very refreshing perspective and although no concrete predictions about how this will/can change are forthcoming, perhaps understandably so, Terrill still offers an interesting framework for reckoning China's supposedly stellar future by laying out its imperialistic past in such excruciating but lucid detail.<br />A very satisfying, insightful read and an important addition to your collection if you understand that the thematic intent of this book is very specific.

Some very interesting anecdotal evidence here about Ghosn's uncanny ability to motivate subordinates several layers down in Nissan. Automotive companies today are multicultural institutions that operate across traditional geopolitical/cultural boundaries. While several top-brass CEOs (e.g., Nasser who was with Ford until 2001) have recognized this and yet failed to implement it, Ghosn has won his laurels the old-fashioned way -- by enabling a free exchange of ideas in an ailing monster of a Japanese organization. This alone speaks volumes about the man's personality, and I am happy to say I was not disappointed with Magee's treatment of this aspect.<br />Nonetheless, a business book is a business book. There is only so much detail that can be smooshed in to it, and inevitably completeness needs to be sacrificed for readability by a wide audience. I personally felt that the book sort of glosses over several key points that could have made this a 6 out of 5 stars material --<br />(1) A more granular look at WHAT Ghosn *really* did in terms of enabling the culture of flexibility without really changing the otherwise autonomous structure that underpins Nissan, i.e., without too much Renault-ification; what processes did he institute to ensure being heard at the lower rungs of the giant organization. Some more managerial nitty gritty would be welcome.<br /><br />(2) A coverage of some more negative, sensitive issues such as the controversial buy-out of African-American farmers for the site of the huge new Nissan assembly plant near Canton (why should everything that Nissan has done only be seen in a positive light simply because this is an ode to its CEO?)<br /><br />(3) A more significant background on the contribution of Louis Schweitzer, Renault's low-profile chairman. Curious minds want to know if Ghosn \\"went it alone\\" or did he have the ideological spine of someone else too.<br /><br />(4) A mention of Ghosn's plans (instead of vague broad-brush corporate objectives) for the next few years e.g. the focus on emerging markets such as Turkey. Wouldn't a star CEO such as him for instance be expected to topple Toyota for the no.1 spot? I may be speaking out of turn but THAT to me would be a benchmark of Ghosn's true success because a murky side of me still suspects that part of his success can be attributed to his being a \\"Gaikokujin\\" (a foreigner, and it is possible this is why he may have been allowed some slack by his Japanese subordinates), or that he came in with almost zero expectation.<br />Anyway, this is a slim wishlist and despite some of these themes being given a somewhat short shrift in the favor of singing paeans to Ghosn, I'd recommend this book highly as an accessible introduction into one of the most successful turn-arounds of the 21st century. If nothing else, it bears an important message in thumping down the stale notion that Japanese companies can only survive by sticking hook line and sinker to their dated, dogmatic ways.ssues such as the controversial buy-out of African-American farmers for the site of the huge new Nissan assembly plant near Canton (why should everything that Nissan has done only be seen in a positive light simply because this is an ode to its CEO?)<br /><br />(3) A more significant background on the contribution of Louis Schweitzer, Renault's low-profile chairman.

Books	5	230	240	N	N	Excellent thought-piece coffee table stuff, but some caveats	After 10 years, this still remains a classic work in the marketing field, and perhaps a must-read for anyone in business. And no, unlike many reviewers I do not believe that Ries and Trout have ever managed to redo the glory of this book in their Laws of Branding, Laws of Internet Branding etc.<br />Don't expect an excruciating marketing treatise with elaborate case studies and What-If scenarios. Expect instead 22 capsules of business wisdom, or \\"laws\\" of common sense marketing with some brilliant examples from the real world to prove them. In this, the book excels and is to date the briefest and best argued work I have come across.<br />However, given the passion with which some reviewers comment about this book I am inclined to offer a caveat -- please don't base your career around it. Although I love thin, in-your-face books such as this (great reading, great examples to bounce off) they also have a fundamental flaw: the fact that they attempt to shove \\"laws\\" on to the ever-morphing scaffold of the business of  marketing that does not lend itself easily to codification, much less of an \\"immutable\\" nature.<br />It would be a cinch to come up with examples that go against each law in the book if you really wanted.<br />For instance,<br />(1) Law of Leadership (better to be first than to be best) can be argued against with the theory of disruptions and how first-mover advantages do not always materialize. Why is WebCrawler not more popular than Google? Because Google is (way) better.<br />(2) The Law of Sacrifice (that talks about focus, as do a couple of other similar if not redundant laws, including, well, the Law of Focus) would not hold much fizz in the case of many very successful conglomerates, especially in Asian countries. Imagine a company selling everything from oil to fruit juice to IT services, and still being a top brand in a country. Examples abound in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan.<br />(3) The Law of the Opposite that advocates the definition of your strategy by considering the leader's (also redundant with the Law of the Ladder, which essentially says the same thing) can be argued by giving umpteen examples of companies that shot from being No.2 to being No.1, some times because No.1 filed for Chapter 11. In such cases, emulating the leader could have in fact been detrimental.<br />Etc.<br />Anyway, despite redundancies across the laws, and the possiblity of counter-argument against most of them, this is a ripper of a read for the business intent that it was written for, and 10 years after its publication still as charming as it first was.<br />Highly recommended reading, but keep your discerning senses about you.

Charles Black, a former investment banker and a tough-nut chairman of the Fed quits his job in a struggle with the White House over rising interest rates. But he's persuaded to stay on for a while as a special envoy to represent the Fed at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Swiss-based institution that serves as the industrialized world's clearinghouse for payments and monetary information.<br />So imagine Black's rude surprise when he arrives in Basel, Switzerland for one of the BIS's regular monthly meetings. Instead of the warm welcome he had been receiving for the past four years as a Fed chief, he is arrested, jailed, and charged with using his exclusive knowledge of U.S. interest-rate moves to mastermind the most audacious insider-trading scheme ever.<br />Intrigued yet?<br />As the conspiracy begins to unfold, Black finds himself no more than a fall guy for a shadowy Sardinian financier, a conniving Swiss lawyer with a desk full of secret bank accounts, and the real inside trader--a corrupt president of the Swiss National Bank. In this mix of characters lies the potential for a Hitchcockian drama of a victim mixing it up with his tormentors as he tries to clear his name. The Set-Up journeys from San Francisco and Washington to Switzerland, Sardinia, and the wilds of Alaska, where the plot against Black falls apart.<br />On the good side, Erdman keeps things moving with his descriptions of shady Swiss dealings, and prison life. Big Swiss heads come off as men of impeccable social standing but a flexible moral character. That's an all-too-common shortcoming among the Swiss big-money set that Erdman seems to have studied closely during his life as a doctoral student and banker in Basel.<br />But this is also my minor grouse with the book that is supposed to be more of a thriller than a treatise on global finance.

Our world has obviously chugged along since the days of whimsical DHTML and the other Nielsenesque extreme of prosaic \\"usability for everything\\", and we now have truly new mediums, modern technologies that need increasingly intelligent designing for.<br />This book presents some of the most practical, common-sensical ideologies to deal with such new-fangled challenges.  Several philosophical elements of creative design are discussed, and while such rhetoric may not be everyone's bag, the writing is real-worldly and intuitive enough to be engrossing.<br />What makes it an outstanding book though is the smart undercurrent of design as an art of 'problem solving', with its primary agenda of identifying and meeting goals that target users expect from the medium they interact with.<br />You won't find tips, techniques and code snippets here except when inevitable to illustrate an idea. When we discuss color for instance, we talk about the affective influences of colour on people, not Pantene decimals or the spokes of a colour wheel. Discussing typography is not about quaint typefaces or font sizes but about leading the reader into the information, aiding and facilitating communication. The illustrations are fresh, exciting and for anyone related to design, veritably inspiring.<br />Is this required reading in graphic design courses yet? It should be. It certainly could be. A highly recommended reading for anyone in the business of design.	2003-05-02

Not the stuff of heavyweight history, this, but if this were taught in schools History just may have been the most popular period.<br />A highly recommended gem for your stash.	2003-04-27

But if you are looking for material that substantiates his claims with hard, quantitative evidence, you'd do better with a somewhat more detailed treatise from Chomsky, e.g., \\"Manufacturing Consent\\".<br />This though is a somewhat embittered manifesto, spewing out bits on how administrations in the past from Wilson to Bush Senior have manipulated the public into war with unlikely, usually defenceless enemies. This edition sports a new speech \\"The Journalist from Mars,\\" which lends a refreshingly dissident tenor to the chorus of patriotism. The 31 new pages are particularly relevant today as President Bush picks up where his father left off, once again calling a fear-ridden population to war.<br />Media Control might sound like a flaming rant but it is a good, crisp lead-in into Chomsky's thinking -- likely to be misinterpreted unless you are also familiar with his work otherwise. But his ideas are a welcome second opinion at a time when we should be questioning more than ever whether the spurious memes of \\"War on Terror\\", \\"Shock and Awe\\" etc are really about terrorism or tyranny at all, or a nearly-successful PR agenda pandering to the big few.<br />A highly engaging read.	2003-04-26

He rounded up a flock of 35 leading venture cap investors, from early pioneers such as Eugene Kleiner and Arthur Rock to current industry stars Geoff Yang and John Doerr. Had them reveal a great deal of gripping skinny on their ventures, solid facts from actual deals they'd worked on. Organized the stash of all this collective wisdom into a neat little bound volume -- and voila - we have a ripper of a book!<br />Organized into five parts (Fast Forward, Beginnings, West Coast, East Coast and Visions), the book examines the industry's humble beginnings to its extraordinary present (ok, very very recent past and hopefully a recent future). For a non-US reader such as myself, it also contains a priceless critique on the differences between West Coast and East Coast investing, which is unique because you'll recognize that a relatively nascent industry such as VC can sport widely varying investment philosophies as well. As investment spreads out to Europe, Australia and China, this becomes even more useful.<br />The book packs info about the hottest deals we had heard about - from Yahoo to www.Amazon.com - which makes for a gripping read in of itself. But beyond that, there are invaluable insights and discussions at length about how the VCs set up their partnerships and hand pick top management teams. Much better than reading a \\"VC 101\\" text book because it presents a hands-on glimpse at the industry's past and future from the veterans' point of view.<br />Consider this book to be a detailed case study introduction to some of the more successful companies, from some of the more committed (and recognized) minds. A highly recommended possession for your libraries -- if not as investment advice, at least as an insider guide to the fascinating industry of venture capital.s -- if not as investment advice, at least as an insider guide to the fascinating industry of venture capital.	2003-04-19

This makes it a fascinating read as a case study guide. An attempt to weave these scattered insights into a summary recommendation at the end of each essay, or at least some mention of what the client in question actually ended up doing, would have been even more useful. Sans such synoptic editing, this book ends up being little more than thought piece for the branding experts on some issues that pertain to corporate identity (and the marketing bottomline) but this is by no means a holistic branding reference as one of the other reviewers seemed to indicate.<br />All the same, I would still give it is a 4 star for its readability, for the breadth and the reality of the cases picked for discussion, and for the sharpness/relevance of the insights that went into discussing them. Should be a no-brainer of a buy if you are interested in the identity/advertising/marketing strategy industry in any way, especially as a real-world companion to any of Aaker's works.	2003-04-17

This book primarily updates the argument set forth in the first book with one particular phenomenon: the global expansion of Japanese multinational companies.<br />Emmott sketches out six reasons why Japanese firms may have rushed to invest overseas --<br />(1) perceived opportunities to arbitrage superior management against lower wage rates;<br />(2) the need to evade trade barriers;<br />(3) the cheapness of foreign assets paid for in inflated yen borrowed at low interest rates;<br />(4) the need to be represented locally to be successful in certain highly competitive markets;<br />(5) the opportunity to take advantage of local technology; and<br />(6) the pursuit of Japanese customers overseas.<br />Most of these still ring true in 2002. This is a fasnicating read for anyone interested in an unabashed dissection of the Japanese economy. Perhaps could be peppered with Porter's somewhat newer &quot;Can Japan Compete?&quot;. As nail-biting and still enlightening as economic analysis can get.	2003-04-17

Must to the dismay of Japan, these predictions have indeed come about and will most likely not be easy to alleviate.<br />To give you an idea of the scope you can expect from this fabulous collection of essays, Emmott talks about the \\"Predictable 4\\" ills of this country, which is still quite impressive given that these may not have been the top priorities of those Japan-crazy times...<br />  (1) Lack of natural resources<br />  (2) Lack of a military<br />  (3) Low birth rate and aging population<br />  (4) Hostility towards immigrants<br />...but then even more impressively goes on to discuss at length some factors that were conventionally perceived as strengths in the 80s --<br />(5) Japan's high rate of personal savings, though understood to reflect frugality, actually derived from the complete absence of other outlets for consumers.  With no opportunity to buy a home and no need for a car, the citizenry had nothing else to do with their money but to put it into low-yield savings accounts.<br />(6) Extensive trade barriers, which on an artificial level seemed to protect Japanese industries, actually stifled competition and drove up prices for domestic consumers.<br />(7) The homogenous population and practically one-party government, which were thought to provide stability and societal cohesion, predictably leading to stasis, insularity, and corruption.<br />(8) The conformity and obedience which made for such a good workforce also made for a supremely unimaginative people.  Japan has become an economic force by manufacturing high quality products cheaply, but the products themselves were invented elsewhere, mostly in US or Germany.  This was double trouble because there were several other nations (Korea, Taiwan, etc.) with equally disciplined labor corps, capable of meeting the same quality standards, and willing to work for lower wages.  But more importantly, as the world economy moved from the old heavy manufacturing model towards one based on intellectual capital, Japan found itself unable to compete.<br />(9) The myth of centralized planning, as is recognized by all except pseudo-intellectuals, is so inefficient that it is almost entirely unresponsive to  any changing circumstances, but especially to such an enormous paradigm shift.  If no one, or very few, even recognize or understand what's going on in the economy, how are a few bureaucrats supposed to intelligently direct the economy.<br /><br />For any astute watcher of the Japanese economy, this should perhaps be THE de facto introduction, even before anything by Alex Kerr or Ikujiro Nonaka. Some of the statistics may obviously be dated but the thoughts and the frame of analysis are both highly relevant even today.<br />Also recommended: Porter's Can Japan Compete? and Emmott's Japanophobia.ers.<br />(7) The homogenous population and practically one-party government, which were thought to provide stability and societal cohesion, predictably leading to stasis, insularity, and corruption.<br />(8) The conformity and obedience which made for such a good workforce also made for a supremely unimaginative people.

In a typically verbose, self-confessed 'prophetic mode of the inspired historian' he makes the reader wade through an egotistical, occasionally insightful and entertaining, and at times even annoyingly predictable view of the future of the networked world that he believes is no less consequential than the most important breakthroughs in physics. <br />Expect to work through stuff like: \\"Beyond the copper cages of existing communications, the telecosm dissolves the topography of old limits and brings technology into a boundless, elastic new universe, fashioned from incandescent oceans of bits on the electromagnetic spectrum.\\"<br />A perfectly predictable notion that bandwidth will revolutionize our world (what a surprise!) is fleshed out into 20 putative laws of the telecosm that provide provocative rules to live by. Some of Gilder's reasoning is tenuous, and many of his conclusions are obvious.

Combining those facts, Gilder grapples to arrive at the terribly simple idea that companies should strive to save time for their customers. Uh huh.<br />The flow of the book can be as daunting as the prose. Essentially this is 4 books in 1 -- <br />1. An investment guide, which really should be skipped for your own good.

Kerr's Dogs and Demons will equip you with a lot of such satisfying trivia. But where this book out stands out is in its focus on the vacuity of Japan's post-modern culture instead of the tired discussions about Japan-US trade frictions or the incompetence of domestic government and indigenous manufacturers.

The difficult things (Demons) are ostentatious and expensive surface statements, symbolic gestures rather than substantive commitments -- e.g., museums without artwork, monuments without honor, roads without destinations. <br />Although somewhat wry, this is a well argued and a very readable tirade on what Kerr sees as Japan's dysfunctional value-system, a land fraught with contradictions and mis-spent opportunities -- \\"nature lovers\\" who concrete over their rivers and sea-shores, financial regulators who mismanage waning stock markets, technocrats who fail to warn against preventable disasters, and the world's largest creditor nation concealing a national debt approaching 150% of GDP. I found the keen observations and little-known facts that crop up along the way quite entertaining.<br />HOWEVER, the book has its imperfections. Some minor slip-ups are easily glossed over by the forgiving reader -- e.g., \\"The Prince of Egypt\\" was not from Disney but from Dreamworks. But sweeping generalizations are more troubling. For example, Mr. Kerr tells us \\"Japan is the world's only advanced country that does not bury telephone cables and electric lines.\\" The idea is to show that Japan's city-planning lags behind practice in most Western cities. A little research will tell you that Tokyo's twenty three wards boast 90% of its transmission and 42% of its distribution cables buried under ground, while London only records about 43%. No mention also is made of the land here being earthquake prone which definitely has a big hand in the kind of construction that is undertaken, or the fact that cabling practices may have changed in the recent past (most of Japan's surface cables are actually a legacy).<br />In discussing how Japan's insular values have isolated its cinema, Mr. Kerr declares that \\"there has never been a successful joint Western-Japanese or Asian-Japanese film, or any highly regarded Japanese film set in another country.

People will tell you the TI is easier to use but my HP 12C took me no more than a couple of hours to fully figure out. Your mileage may vary but I'd highly recommend it. If nothing else it will definitely impress your colleagues and seniors after the CFA when you use this workhorse instead of the TI contraption because the latter sounds like a cop out on to the easier path (I am serious).<br />You may want to take HP's RPN functionality for a ride, which may be overwhelming for the uninitiated at first. Try it on a few longish calculations. You will find it faster than the usual notation and less error prone (no brackets to keep track of, everything is linear, no storage). Once you get the hang of it, you will find it indispensible. I bet this is one of the top reasons why people who like HP 12C adhere to it for a long term.<br />If you are wondering what it looks and feels like, check this Flash-based replica of an HP calculator, google for \\"HP calculator site:flashkit.com\\" without the quotes.<br />If however you are looking at financial calculators in general for work or personal stuff, then I'd strongly recommend the HP 42s. This is because 28s was discontinued despite being the best that HP has ever produced, and the uber-powerful 48GX with the additional ROM card from springer/Holland is astounding but if you need that level of functionality then let's face it -- you need excel/mathematica/matlab on a powerful laptop:)).<br />So, in terms of immediate calculations, shape, portability, ease of use, simplicity and speed of getting, say, a Black/Scholes done, memorizing a smile, computing an implicit vol, memorizing an interest rate curve and a surface vol -- go with the 42s.<br />Oh, did I mention that HPs have the longevity of cockroaches? I've had mine for 10 years now. Buy a calculator you like and will use, otherwise it is an expensive coaster.and will use, otherwise it is an expensive coaster.	2003-04-11

Disinformation is most effective in a very narrow context, quipped the CIA agent Frank Snepp in 1985, but this massive disquisition from the sharp folks at Disinfo.com (a must visit site for all the critically-minded) is a thrilling compilation with a very, very broad net of expos&eacute;s!<br />The book is neatly organized into sections based on nature of \\"disinformation\\" and lies. Some highlights --<br />LUCRE: the shady world of global finance...includes a revelation based on exclusive leaked documents from the World Bank and the WTO; a stinging criticism of the pharmaceutical industry's exploits; the clandestine financial dealings of the Vatican Bank; a treatise on how antitrust law actually hurts consumers and is used almost exclusively by businesses who want to kneecap their competitors; a worldwide trail of laundered money and global banking secrecy...<br />THE HIGH AND MIGHTY: targeted at the big tykes with dubious credentials...including former Senator Bob Kerrey's active role in the CIA's ultrasecret Phoenix program which involved torturing and killing civilians in Vietnam; the hidden costs of the Olympics; a thrilling account of the secrets behind the \\"European Union\\" -- this is truly eye opening; and finally some of the big groups that magnify and sometimes entirely brew the threat of political extremists in America.<br />TRUE, TRUE CRIME: a devastating look at the case of Henry Lee Lucas, wrongly alleged to be one of the worst serial killers of all time; a gripping account of the case of \\"The Monster of Florence,\\" which inspired Thomas Harris to create his intellectual psychopath, Hannibal Lecter (turns out that the ritualistic killings lead straight to Italy's high society!); and some eye opening stuff in how the cops connive with the gangs in the war for drugs.<br />THE BODY AND MIND: scrutinizes medical misgivings of our world...some fact-based insight into the mad cow disease which may have already invaded the entire world not just UK; how a lot of the meat and animal food in our world may affect global health, humanitarian, and environmental problems; how out mental illness may just be a ruse; and how psychiatric drugging of children for behavioral control is damaging to the \\"subjects\\".<br />SOCIAL DISTORTION: my favorite section of the book -- shatters our generation's pet peeve about unprecedented problems with 'today's young people' as the facts tell a different story--kids nowadays are less violent and use less drugs and alcohol than their parents' generation. Did you know that men comprise a significant portion of domestic abuse victims as well? The section contains some fascinating and somewhat topical reads about the adverse effects of media-saturated consumer culture on our psyches; the current trend toward forced treatment for drug users; about how our relationship options extend far, far beyond the limited choices we're normally given (written by a lesbian); and some pieces about religion.<br />NOT ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS: a startling number of accidents, near-misses, and other problems in nuclear power plants; the destruction of a plane over Scotland that was officially pinned on a Libyan but this official version was truly off-base; the clamour of prominent international leaders against the \\"drug war\\" for nothing other than, well, private gain of course; the sordid horrors of being an untouchable (aka \\"Dalt\\") in India; how the west punishes the developing countries' leaders for noncompliance with their wishes; and a VERY, VERY fascinating piece on the frighteningly underrated military and economic power of China.<br />911 AND BEYOND: a no-one-told-you-so account of the event, the postmortem goings-on (including the reconnaissance mission about Bin laden) and how the whole christianity/islam issue colors USA's \\"axis of evil\\" policy.<br />HIDDEN HISTORY: some shocking events from our recent yet largely forgotten (or unbroadcasted) past ...including \\"The Ludlow Massacre\\" -- a 1914 slaughter of men, women, and children; the shameful treatment of the people of the Bikini Atoll, who were deprived of their homeland and their health so the US could detonate nuclear bombs on their islands; and how, using original quotes from the men who created and implemented the United States' public school system, the school system was purposefully designed the system to keep us dumb and docile.<br />You have to be incurably slow to be still sitting there wondering whether this book is worth it...it should be included in architecture textbooks to be an integral part of a living room shelf in ANY house!

Soft Green / Hard Green	Given the degree to which the reciprocal conflict between economy and ecology is couched in our lives by now, it is surprising how little of a concerted effort exists in terms of a framework to understand the ecological crisis and the fundamental transformation for industrial capitalism, i.e., new business concepts and technological processes that can save the earth. This book offers an important, bold, optimistic framework.<br />It sets off quickly by challenging the glaring fallacy of orthodox economics that natural capital is an infinite resource to be used as input for manufacturing and other human activities because nature is \\"free\\" except for costs of extracting, transporting, altering it and is also a bottomless pit where the wasted materials can be conveniently dumped.  Nowhere in the accounting books of our current businesses do we see any entry for the finite elements of the earth itself: land, air, water, the multitudes of self-sustaining biosystems. This becomes quite startling a discussion when the authors reveal an estimate that in the vast flows of natural materials devoured by the global economy every year, only 3 percent actually end up in products.<br />Optimistically (as this whole book is), Hawkens et al then demonstrate with their plethora of real-world case studies and anecdotes that eco-friendly processes are already in place, not just as wishful theory but as a set of successful and even spreading practices.<br />One noteworthy example of Natural Capitalism in the book is about the \\"ecological city\\" Curitiba, which is located in the Southeastern Brazilian state of Parana and has a population of about 4 million people--the size of Houston or Philadelphia. There, \\"responsible government in partnership with vital entrepenurship has succeeded better than most cities in the U.S.\\" They have implemented \\"hundreds of multipurpose, cheap, fast, simple homegrown, people-centered initiatives...treating all its citizens--most of all its children--not as burden but as most precious resource\\". This is a good testimony to how these new approaches to production and consumption can in fact be used to redefine socio-economic life, not out of noblesse oblige but because they deliver dramatic cost-saving efficiencies to the bottom line, that is, higher rates of return for capital.<br />However, Hawkens et al take what is perhaps a \\"Soft Green\\" approach compared to Peter Huber's \\"Hard Green\\" (ISBN: 0465031137), who defines Soft proponents as supporters of micro-management and future forecasting by computer-based models. Hard resources, such as coal and oil, represent cheap but nonrenewable energy sources, while \\"Soft\\" refers to such expensive, alternative, and renewable energy sources as wind and solar power.<br />Natural Capitalism endorses the outcome of market processes and credit the Industrial Revolution with increasing real wages, raising standards of living, and expanding the productivity of labor 200 fold! Ultimately, dematerialization and prosperity have prevailed over the early negative effects of industrialization. In wealthy, highly modernized nations, pollution and waste have been significantly decreased, with some types even eliminated. The criticism of Hawken  et al. concerning the market process (one that free-market environmentalists are willing to concede) is that for-profit ventures only account for what is on the ledger, with the end result being a loss of capital. Thus,  Natural Capitalism offers strategies and examples of success that empower people to behave \\"as if all forms of capital were valued\\".<br />Huber on the other hand clearly prefers solutions from technology and market processes. \\"To Hard Green minds...ecological objectives are effectively advanced only by dispersed control, free markets, and traditional ethics\\". Above all,  he promotes wealth as the cure of environmental insensitivity and physical damage grounded in his belief that technology and market coordination will foster prosperity,dematerialization, and enhanced environmental awareness, but he dismisses alternative approaches as wasteful.<br />Despite many differences, Natural Capitalism and  Hard Green share an adulation of innovative economic solutions and implicitly acknowledge environmental quality to be a superior good. New approaches are bound to exasperate some and excite others but both these books pose an intelligent challenge to lazy assumptions on both sides of the political divide and ought to jump-start a reinvigorated environmental debate.<br />Either way, this is a valuable purchase for just about anyone involved in business or policy making. But a sincere reader would consider tempering this book with Peter Huber's work as well.dematerialization, and enhanced environmental awareness, but he dismisses alternative approaches as wasteful.<br />Despite many differences, Natural Capitalism and  Hard Green share an adulation of innovative economic solutions and implicitly acknowledge environmental quality to be a superior good.

Most people reading this review will know Schelling as a renowned game-theorist/economist, and perhaps as a nobel-prize winner. This is bound to lead to an impression that his books must most likely be economic discourses full of the metrics and highfalutin theoretical abstractions that usually pervade the field in academic circles.<br />I'll dispel that myth and have you know that Schelling's books -- notably this one and his seminal \\"Strategy of Conflict\\" (SOC) -- are as close as you'll come to a readable yet gripping compendium of his fascinating economic thinking. His writing is purposefully simple, and his sharp arguments evoke thoughts about matters that can and will appeal to just about any Joe Bloggs.<br />But this book is different from any of Schelling's other published works.<br />SOC for instance was a compilation of roughly a dozen essays discussing negotiation, conflict and strategy...the applications of which were international -- diplomacy, deterrence, arms control, foreign aid, environmental policy, nuclear proliferation, organized crime, racial segregation and integration, tobacco and drugs policy, and ethical issues in policy and business.<br />While most of Schelling's work including SOC has been of a macro-economic bent, the essays in this book extend his theories to a more personal, social level -- things such as how people maneuver in traffic jams, how parents negotiate with their kids (toughest customers in my book), how they behave when confronted with ransom demands, or file suits, or devise agendas for a meeting or their daily lives.  I would draw your attention in particular to chapter 6, \\"Strategic Relationships in Dying\\" which touches upon some very interesting subjects such as the relationship between a patient and his doctor, especially a terminally ill patient -- where significant human \\"choices\\" need to be made to withhold information, to authenticate assertions, and the conflict of interest that arises within small groups. This article truly underscores that apart from being a leading political economist, a m&eacute;tier Schelling has clearly excelled at, he is also at heart a fabulous thinker and writer.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in strategy, or economics, or negotiation, or even a basic thought-provoking intelligent read.<br />Shashank Tripathiicle truly underscores that apart from being a leading political economist, a m&eacute;tier Schelling has clearly excelled at, he is also at heart a fabulous thinker and writer.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in strategy, or economics, or negotiation, or even a basic thought-provoking intelligent read.<br />Shashank Tripathi	2003-04-09

Beautifully illustrated by Olivia Fraser, The Age of Kali offers a compassionate view of a nation struggling against forces both modern and ancient. William Dalrymple has written a book that is required reading for anyone interested in India's emerging role in world affairs.<br />Hindu cosmology divides time into four great epochs, or yugs, which represent the movement from perfection toward moral and social disintegration. Many Indians today believe that they live in the Kali Yug, or Age of Kali, a period of rapidly advancing darkness marked by chaos, corruption, and decay. Not until the world is cleansed by fire will the cycle repeat itself, restoring balance. \\"In the Age of Kali,\\" writes Dalrymple, \\"the great gods Vishnu and Shiva are asleep and do not hear the prayers of their devotees. In such an age, normal conventions fall apart: anything is possible.\\" Despite being at the vanguard of the computer software industry and having recently joined the ranks of world superpowers with the successful test of an atomic bomb--an ominous development when one considers the state of relations with neighboring Pakistan--India remains a country firmly entrenched in the past. In much the same way that the Luddites rebelled against the first wave of industrialization, so too have many Indians, especially the more conservative followers of the Hindu religion, resorted to violence to express their dissatisfaction with encroaching Western influence. Xenophobia and intense nationalism maintain in defiance of the fast food restaurants, beauty pageants, and satellite TV stations that threaten traditional Indian values.<br />Dalrymple's essays succeed in presenting the many disparate facets of Indian society as a whole, from the glitterati of Bombay's movie scene (otherwise known as \\"Bollywood\\") to the dispossessed women of Vrindavan who roam the streets begging alms, to the conflicts between Hindu and Muslim factions that continue to escalate in number and intensity (including the recent horrendous Gujarat massacres), to the blood feuds and political turf wars waged in Bihari, which, like Lahore and parts of Uttar Pradesh, has succumbed to the rule of drug lords and corrupt government officials, or surprisingly even to the risilient malaises such as caste system and sati -- the research is right on target.<br />This is an amusing book, laden with factual insights about India, and is a breeze to identify with -- perhaps it takes an \\"outsider\\" to look at a kaleidoscopic country under such a prying lens.

I am impelled to write this review after reading the ill-educated notes from others about this book. Especially one that extols Nehru as &quot;the one who got us freedom&quot;. Nothing could be more risibly further from the truth.<br />For those who are not aware of it, M.J. Akbar is the chief editor of one of the fringe news publications in India called The Asian Age (and I label it fringe based on its circulation numbers, not its journalism). I could hoist innumerable examples of thoughtful articles and research that have come from Mr. Akbar, but unfortunately and inexplicably this book is disappointing in its view of the Nehru dynasty. Perhaps a more fitting title for the book would have been &quot;The making of India&quot; because there is little that is engaging or enlightening about Nehru's life and personality.<br />A very different view of Nehru and his peccadilloes emerges from a couple of other factual books, often not touted as being the most &quot;popular&quot; because they do NOT pander to mass opinions -- &quot;Nehru Dynasty&quot; by K.N. Rao and &quot;Nehru: A Tryst With Destiny&quot; by Stanley Wolpert. It is clear to any close watcher of Indian politics around that era that Nehru's life (as well as the lives of his children/grandchildren) that Nehru was in fact much more of an irresponsible womanizer, a rich-dad's spoilt brat more interested in touring the world, and a politician of absolutely no original thinking. He was an eloquent speaker and a charismatic person by virtue of his fluent English, which unfortunately at the time went a long way in impressing people but his life is rife with political blunders. None of which is mentioned in this book.<br />There is also a known controversy around the appointment of Nehru as the first prime minister, because a unanimous decision post-independence proposed Sardar Vallabbhai Patel as the first PM of India. But Nehru's attention-deficient and wheedling ways got him the podium instead -- not his caliber. Such information would have best suited a book like this one, but is sadly remiss.<br />To cut to the chase, if you are interested in Nehru and his errant ways, this is not the book (the other two recommendations are). If you are interested in the events surrounding India's independence -- which was a lot more influenced by the repercussions of WW II on Britain than the efforts of Gandhi or particularly Nehru (who was basically useless) -- then this book will have some interesting tidbits for you.Such information would have best suited a book like this one, but is sadly remiss.<br />To cut to the chase, if you are interested in Nehru and his errant ways, this is not the book (the other two recommendations are).

So get it, read it and enjoy it. Even if it doesn't ruffle your fancies, it brims with real factual evidence about the dark side of big business so at the very least you'll leave with some very interesting information off a single, compact compilation.<br />THE LONG, WINDING RAMBLE:<br />The basic premise of the book is to highlight how advertising and general business practices have changed in the last twenty years. Essentially, companies decided that they were no longer in the business of selling products, because products are messy, duplicable, or even improvable. But if you are selling an idea, an experience, a set of associations, it is much harder for another company to compete with you. Think of Tommy Hilfiger for instance -- clothes manufactured in China and India for throw-away costs, but their designs are frantically devoured globally at horrendous price tags. This is why branding is big, and sometimes clandestine, business.<br />The book is divided into four sections: 'No Space,' 'No Choice,' 'No Jobs' and 'No Logo.' 'No Space' is about the cluttering of our public spaces with ads; 'No Choice' describes different tactics used by big-name brands to drive independent retailers out of business; 'No Jobs' takes aim at sweatshop labour but with the corporations' &quot;Brand, not products!&quot; mentality in mind (it also includes details of Klein's trip to an Export Processing Zone just south of Manila); finally, 'No Logo' documents the global movement against branding and many of the organizations and people behind the revolt.<br />POSITIVES:<br />1. Klein's fluid writing style really shines throughout this book and her arguments are sharp and well targeted.<br />2. A delightful plethora of interesting, superbly researched facts and statistics that'll open your eyes, sometimes vis-a-vis brands that you'd least expect to be embroiled with anything ulterior.<br />3. I found that each section contained one exceptional chapter. In 'No Space,' &quot;The Branding of Learning&quot; (chapter 4) is simply wonderful, especially for students of branding. You'll read about grade school kids making Nike sneakers as &quot;an educational experience&quot; and a 19-year-old student being suspended for wearing a Pepsi shirt on &quot;Coke Day.&quot; In &quot;No Jobs,&quot; &quot;The Discarded Factory&quot; (chapter 9) offers the same old shocking facts about sweatshop labour with a fresh perspective which only makes the situation seem worse. Etc.<br />NEGATIVES:<br />1. Where No Logo fails is in its attempt to tie these different themes together. With an attempt of this genre, it would have been very unseful to see some &quot;solutions&quot; or recommendations to the issue that Klein raised. For instance, she argues that companies have to spend more money on 'branding', and this is why production is moving to sweatshops. Companies can't afford to have factories and a brand, so they ditched the factories. But its not just the big brands that are made in sweatshops. Nike runners may be made in Indonesia, but so are the local-brand runners in your supermarket. Gap shirts are made in sweatshops, but so are the shirts in the department store. The sweatshops aren't a result of branding, they're a product of the desire of companies to cut costs. Some companies will then keep their prices low, while others will spend a lot on advertising, but hope to make even more by charging higher prices. In the end, Nike is bad, Gap is bad -- but what should they do in lieu of their current practices?<br />2. Related to the above point, Klein skimps on examples of the &quot;good&quot; companies or what is commonly tossed around as &quot;best practices&quot;.<br />3. Perhaps many of the corporate ties within the open source software community are very much along the lines of Klein's notion of an ideal balance between corporations and communities. A discussion of open source projects -- especially coming from a journalist of the caliber of Naomi Klein -- is amiss.<br />All in all, a very thought-provoking read, but too much time is spent talking about 'subverting' advertisements or painting over billboards. Consumer boycotts are explored, even while their weaknesses are admitted. So there's less room to explore ways that we in the west can help sweatshop workers get organised, and how we can help their struggles, which should be the objectives of any campaign. As a commercial-political treatise or as an analytical guide to action, which is what the book could easily have been, this book is a little disappointing.

US	52287009	R135TYC9BLPX7L	1870098811	76520224	The Ecology of Money (Schumacher Briefings)	Books	4	7	8	N	N	A good enough book for a preview, but another recommendation	I knew Bernard Lietaer as one of the world's leading authorities on complementary currencies and a chief architect of the Euro. As a former senior officer of the Belgian Central Bank and active in the domain of money systems for 25 years, his thoughts about money markets were always quite impressive. This book does an excellent job of providing a summary introduction into how money has worked and evolved in our societies.<br />However, given that you are reading this review and are most likely interested in monetary economics in some way, I'd also strongly recommend Lietaer's seminal work \\"The future of money\\", which he wrote while he was a fellow at UC, Berkeley. For some inadequately explored reason, only Amazon.co.uk seems to have the book on their database (ISBN: 0-7126-8399-2).<br />Here are some interesting glimpses from the future of money to give you a feel for the material you'll read... your money's value is determined by a global casino of unprecedented proportions...$2 trillion are traded per day in foreign exchange markets, 100 times more than the trading volume of all the stockmarkets of the world combined. Only 2% of these foreign exchange transactions relate to the \\"real\\" economy reflecting movements of real goods and services in the world, and 98% are purely speculative. This global casino is triggering the foreign exchange crises which shook Mexico in 1994-5, Asia in 1997 and Russia in 1998. These emergencies are the dislocation symptoms of the old Industrial Age money system. Unless some precautions are taken soon, there is at least a 50-50 chance that the next five to ten years will see a global money meltdown, the only plausible way for a global depression.<br />The Information Age has already spawned new kinds of currencies...the ilk of PayPal, frequent flyer miles evolving towards a \\"corporate scrip\\" (a private currency issued by a corporation) for the traveling elite; a giant corporation you never heard of is issuing its own \\"Netmarket Cash\\" for Internet commerce; even Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, foresees \\"new private currency markets in the 21st century.\\"<br />Exorbitant compensations are paid to the very few at the top: it started with movie stars and sports heroes, and has now spread to top lawyers, traders, doctors, and business leaders. In the 1960s CEO salaries were only thirty times greater than those of the average worker, compared with two hundred times today (of course Enron and Worldcom debacles may change this somewhat, but salaries won't drop overnight). About 1900 local communities in the world, including over a hundred in the US, are now issuing their own currency, independently from the national money system. Some communities, like in Ithaca, New York, issue paper currency; others in Canada, Australia, the UK or France issue complementary electronic money.<br />The value of barter transactions exchanges which do not use any money as medium of exchange - totaled almost $6.5 billion in 1994 in the US and Canada, and is increasing three times faster than normal exchanges. The magazine \\"Barter News\\" covers the industry's development and now has 30,000 subscribers. It estimates the total barter worldwide at $650 billion in 1997, and growing at an annual rate of 15%.<br />All of the above are a part of a global and irreversible process of change in our money systems and our societies. We are now in a transition period and Lietaer lucidly documents and analyzes the crevices in our official monetary systems (e.g., the 1994 Mexico crash, the Asian downturn of 1997, Brazil's woes in 1999 etc), societal problems related with ageing of our populations or with the ramifications of an information economy, and even broader environmental issues such as UN's declaration in 1998 of the world's worst year EVER for natural disasters -- and how we can resolve the ideological conflict between short-term financial gains and long term sustainibility.<br />If a work of non-fiction ever cameclose to being a financial thriller, Lietaer has written it. Required reading for anyone involved in the business of money.close to being a financial thriller, Lietaer has written it. Required reading for anyone involved in the business of money.	2003-03-25

But overall it focuses more on the &quot;Joe Blogg&quot; tips and tricks approach, which may work for some people and not for others. I still believe knowing sincerely how to solve problems will get you far. But the PR book makes for an interesting read, gives you some excellent strategies (e.g., about the essay sections etc) and does the best job of introducing the concept of &quot;difficulty level bins&quot; -- which is how the CAT works. I, much to my surprise I admit, ended up with a 780 and for those about to take the GMAT, some tips:<br />1. Definitely get yourself the 'Official Guide' (published by ETS) -- that is indespensable. You should aim to complete it from cover to cover - it gives you a really good idea of the test questions though the math is a liitle easier than what I saw on the test. It even has a comprehensive, complete list of essay topics.<br />2. Practice tests -- my scores in Powerprep : 780,770; Kaplan : 670,650,690; Princeton : 750,720. So I'd venture to recommend this book to get a decent estimation of where you really stand, and therefore u must take the included tests seriously -- i.e., emulating the real testing conditions -- in order to get an accurate idea of your potential. Kaplan is really tough - I haven't seen too many folks scoring above 700 in thier tests - infact when i gave the first test straight after a 780 in powerprep and got a 650 I was pretty turned off - but later found out that it wasn't really a big deal. Get Kaplan for practice, but the PR and the official guide should be enough.<br />3. PREP BOOKS: Well other than the Official guide, I used PR and Kaplan. I found the math tips in Kaplan (50 of them) quite impressive but the practice tests in PR give you a very good idea of difficulty levels of math/analytic. This book lays out the test in &quot;bins&quot; (easy bin, medium bin, and the tough bin). I found this to be a very unique and useful feature.<br />All in all, this particular book is superb for its purpose and complements the ETS OG fabulously. Highly recommended!seful feature.<br />All in all, this particular book is superb for its purpose and complements the ETS OG fabulously. Highly recommended!	2003-03-25
US	52287009	R16FH2VGXDE2DY	0735712638	867840778	Designing CSS Web Pages	Books	5	53	56	N	N	This is a good book, but not for everyone.	In terms of quality, I'd rate this book as high as anything from Glasshaus, most prominently &quot;Cascading Style Sheets: Separating Content from Presentation&quot;.<br />This book covers a lot of the same ground as the Glasshaus title but I found it particularly useful due to its slightly more graphic design bent. The code samples in the book are not merely basic utility layouts (2 columns, 3 columns, vertical centering etc), but more aesthetically 'designed' examples of using CSS -- a feature clearly missing in a lot of books aimed at the 'web developer' community. I'd venture to say I am not one of those to get so enamoured with the technology itself that they fail to see it as a handy means to an end. I really value Schmitt's efforts in this sense.<br />Again we get the 'separating content from design' jazz, fair enough, but then the author takes a slightly different direction choosing to show how CSS can be linked to other technologies such as JavaScript and the not-so-common PNG and SVG graphics file formats. PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is partly supported by most modern browsers and offers many advantages over the GIF format. SVG (Scaleable Vector Graphics) is similar to Flash, but can be scripted directly from JavaScript on the page. This may or may not be useful to some of you.<br />There are many CSS techniques in the W3C specifications that are poorly, inconsistently, or not supported at all, in even the latest browsers. As a practising designer, and not just an academic, Christopher is only too happy to point out the limitations of browsers and explains some of the many pitfalls that await the unwary if you try to push the envelope too far.<br />The projects, again downloadable from the publisher's Web site, focus on publishing - in business, personal and 'underground' styles. The typography is a lot fancier than any other book I've seen and the attention to detail, even for 'web' typography, is highly commendable.<br />An earlier review on this website said this book is not well technically edited. I am not sure why that was said, but I work with Opera 6 (and 7 beta), Mozilla 0.9 and above, netscape 6 and above and IE 4 and above. All samples I have tried have impressed me.<br />In sum, if you want to separate your content from design and give your 'styles' some, er, style, AND if you are fairly familiar with the basic CSS lingo (i.e., you dont need to know box models or glish but should understand what a link rel is), then this is probably a very useful book for you. If you are looking for a very basic introduction to CSS, I'd strongly recommend the Glasshaus book. If you are serious about your work, get both.site said this book is not well technically edited.

This is a superb book, get it if you are interested in the world of derivatives. As the title suggests, however, this is a *managerial* intro to the world of the world's &quot;most powerful financial intruments&quot; and will be excellent introduction for MBA students. COntains some excellent examples from this world as well (great to know this if you are going to interview).<br />If you want something a lot more numerical and yet friendly, I'd suggest &quot;The Complete Guide to Option Pricing Formulas by Espen Gaarder Haug&quot; to go alongside this book - thats a classic as well. If you want to see the Black-Scholes model in operation, check out [...] Good luck.	2001-07-23

If you are reading this page, it means that you are interested in derivative securities. I am a person who is \\"average\\" on calculus (did it in univ 4 years back), have been a consultant until now since my graduation but wanted to move into i-banking...<br />I sulked at the thought of (if not dreaded) going back to calculus and all those math-heavy thingies, but among my searches I found this book. It sounded best because rather than a lot of historical and theoretical jazz alone, I wanted to see a compilation of the actual formulae. Believe me, JUST GET IT!!<br />1. This book gives me all of the above in one neat capsule form! All the introductory derivatives stuff i read sounded like \\"And derivates can be of the type options, futures etc\\". That 'etc' always bothered me because I wanted something which told me ALL types of derivatives. This book does it - at least MOST of it. It has BlackScholes, binomials, also has an excellent section on Monte Carlo.<br />2. This book also made me feel a lot more confident than the average book from my library - right from chapter 1, I did not feel that it has been a long time since I did derivatives and integration. Worth it.<br />3. Anyone who says that this is too techie for a normal person just does not get it. I am a very ordinary calculus guy, but this made sense ....you of course need to put your head to it..you cannot be watching Seinfeld and reading this book-- and remember, its structured more like a reference book with all the formulas and brief descriptions of why/how/where they are likely to be used. Excellent and efficient scope if you ask me!<br />4. As I said, if you are looking at this page then you are most likely interested in derivatives, and believe me my friend, just get this book. It is worth EACH PENNY regardless of what other books you may have!<br />If you are really keen, I would also suggest reading this in conjunction with \\"Options, futures...\\" by John Hull (Prentice Hall). And if you are really really keen, take a look at this v. informative website:<br /><br />Good luck.keen, take a look at this v. informative website:<br /><br />Good luck.	2001-07-23

OK, before this the two top ones for JSP were:<br />1. Core JSP and Servlets (Marty Hall)<br /> 2. Web Development with JSP  (or something like that)<br />My fav was NO. 1 above because of its lucid descriptions. However, QUE has a winner ...this book is probably the best of all if you wish to get started! Usually I am a fan of Wrox books, but in the case of JSP, these two (Using.. and Core..) take the cake.<br />I am a hardcore PHP and Perl fan (and a liberal dose of Python too) so I am &quot;into&quot; scripting languages. This is one book that will help you if you have been planning to either make a switch or find out what this whole JSP + Servlets craze is all about.<br />I did not like the books that started out with the assumption that you read Java books like comics and feed on Servlets for breakfast...in this book, the first code is actually 1 line!<br />Superb, keep it up.	2000-11-06

Which is what it is, it is certainly not a book. If you are looking for light-years worth of textual reading fodder on the exalted subject of Java Beans and Servlets technology (which are both presumably well established by now), this may be good bed-side reading. If on the other hand you want hands-on code samples with explanations of J2EE oriented concepts, forget this and get yourself a decent book like \\"Mastering Java Beans\\" or any of the Wrox titles on the subject. This was one of those useless quick-to-market type books that usually come out in a flurry to cash in on a new technology's hype. Hope this helps you spend your penny wisely.	2000-06-19
