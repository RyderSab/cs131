The political structures were the same, politics were the same, characters were a little more 2D.  And it seemed like all of the wondrous developments of the Dune world took place seemingly at the same time.  Portable Holtzman shield generators, the beginnings of space-folding, discovery of spice on Arrakis by off-worlders, Tlaxian organ growing, etc.<br /><br />The other thing that struck me while reading the book was it's similarity to God Emperor of Dune.  Replace Omnius with Sandworm Leto, the intelligent robots with the Fedaykin, the outer worlds with Leto's rebels and you have pretty much the same story as in God Emperor.<br /><br />Overall, a good book, enjoyable and easy to read, but just not as satisfying as some of the other books in the Anderson/Herbert Dune collection or the original Dune series.	2004-09-29

It *is* however, a far better replacement for the manuals that comes with most slow cookers though.  There are recipies in the book, and they're good recipies.  The value of the book though comes from the tips and techniques that will teach you how to do more with your slow cooker and how to adapt recipies to slow cookers.  I definitely recommend this for people who are new to slow cooking (the ones who received it as a housewarming/wedding/graduation/other gift).  Slow cooker pro's probably won't get much from this book (of course they're not dummies, so why are they buying a book for dummies?), but newbies and intermediate users definitely will get lots out of this book.	2004-06-30

There are enough examples in this book to cover pretty much everything you might need to do with Apache or get you started (along with the Apache documentation) if it isn't covered.<br />Personally I think the first two chapters on installing Apache and adding modules are wasted space.  Presumably by the time you're ready for this book, you've already got Apache installed on your servers and are just looking for ways to tweak it.<br />I would have liked to see a section on SSI (Server side includes...does anybody use those anymore?) and maybe some more mod_rewrite stuff.<br />This book will probably be most useful to novice and intermediate Apache administrators who are comfortable with messing around in httpd.conf, but need to refer back to the online docs now and then.  Advanced Apache administrators probably won't find much new or useful in this book.	2004-04-28

Veterans may not get a lot out of it, but might still find the chapters on dealing with databases, images and PDF useful.

It's organized by cooking method, rather than ingredients like most other cookbooks.  There are a lot of cookbooks out there full of nothing but recipies, but many of them don't say anything about the different methods to prepare food.  AB also goes into some of the how's and why's of the different preparation methods.  afraid to broil? never poached anything? roasts turn out like lumps of coal?  deep fried stuff ends up grease laden?  You'll pick up a lot of good tips out of this book.  There are a few simple recipies in with each section that you can use to test the waters and practice with.<br />If you like to cook and want to expand your repetoire of cooking techniques, this is a good one to add to the shelf.	2002-05-13

The first book is an excellent text to use for teaching radiology residents the principles of medical imaging.  Now, this second edition with greatly expanded content and pictures looks like it would be suitable for teaching a course to medical physics students.  All sections appear to be significantly expanded with the additional detail needed for medical physicists.  Still excellent for residents, but might go into a little more detail than they need.	2002-04-21

You should definitely be familiar with C before reading this book.  Provides fairly good coverage of the PalmOS memory architecture, and what not to do.  Could be a little more thorough when it comes to programming UI elements though.  Coverage is split between Codewarrior and PRC tools, but could be better on the PRC tools.  I don't know that I would call it a bible though.  The PalmOS function reference section is kind of small, and doesn't describe the function calls very thoroughly.  But I suspect that if it did, the book would be twice as large as it is.<br />All in all, it's a good introductory book to learn from.  Veterans PalmOS programmers probably might want to look elsewhere.	2002-02-26

A solid background in math (especially calculus) is a definite requirement.  This is the text that was used for my undergrad honours physics classes.  Definitely not meant for intro physics geared to non-physics majors.<br />The material is well covered, although a little on the dry side at times.  Plenty of examples and questions to challenge.  The questions at the end of each chapter range from easy to difficult, and are intended to make the student think and probe more deeply into the concepts covered.  Generally they're not questions that can be answered simply by referring back to the chapter or mimicking the examples.  You need to know and understand the material to answer the questions right, especially for the more difficult questions marked by an asterisk.	2002-01-11

I found the examples were reasonably clear and easy to follow.  Text material while on the dry side clearly explained most of the concepts.  The majority of the problems at the end of each chapter were of moderate difficulty, with a few easier ones for warm up at the beginning and some considerably more difficult ones (marked with an asterisk) for a real workout at  the end.<br />This text is by no means meant for an introductory physics course though (i.e. pre-med physics or other general intro physics for non-physicist wannabes).  The book relies heavily on calculus, trig and other higher math knowledge.  People lacking a solid foundation in math and calculus probably will not like this book.  The university I went to offered three levels of physics, one non-calculus based track for non-physics majors, one for engineers and another one for physics majors and honors physics students for which this text was used.	2002-01-10

The scientists profiled are those that made significant contributions and advances in the use of radiation and radioactivity in medicine: Roentgen, Curie, Planck, Rutherford, Bragg, Duane, Bohr, Joliot, Compton and Fermi.

I haven't seen the 4th edition, but I do have the third edition, and found it extremely useful when I was learning how to write shell scripts.  I spent a lot of time looking for books on shell programming, and settled on this one.  It provides an introduction to shell and unix for novices, and has lots of examples as it develops into more advanced techniques.  Overall, I found it was quite clear, easy to read and even useful as a reference when I needed to figure out how to do something.	2001-01-04

This book will no doubt attract significant attention because of  the radiation experiments described, but the book seems be more about the  prevailing attitudes of physicians and scientists towards patients and  research at the time.  The activities that take place in the book occur  during a time when science and medical research came first, and the patient  second, and when physicians seemed as gods to their patients.  As with  other stories of &quot;medical guinea pigs&quot;, emphasis is placed on  those scientists and physicians for whom the patients just happens to be a  convenient vessel to carry out experiments on.  It ultimately boils down to  a question of whether or not the means justifies the ends.  Some of the  experiments performed did provide useful information about the effects of  radiation on humans, which produced significant advances in diagnostic  imaging and radiation therapy and has helped to save and prolong the lives  of countless others.  Other experiments described sound poorly designed,  and seem like they were performed just for the sake of seeing what would  happen.<br />The book starts out with a descriptive history of the atomic  weapons program and the Manhatten project, both on the weapons side and the  medical side.  Focus shifts to the human experiments conducted in the  earliest days of atomic weapon research up until the 1970s.  The author  manages to provide a fascinating insight on the attitudes of the  researchers as well as providing a description of the patients experimented  on.  Read the book and decide for yourself.  Those were different times,  different attitudes.	2000-08-07

One of the best features of the book is that it is emminently readable and relatively uncluttered  with jargon.  The second edition expands on the first with additional  material in each chapter, and considerably more pictures that are  illustrative, rather than just eye candy.  Concepts in radiation protection  are further illustrated and reinforced by case studies.  Any one in the  radiological field would do well to have this text as part of their  bookshelf.  Those with the first edition, I recommend upgrading to the  second edition.	2000-06-06

I find myself constantly referring to it.  The first section contains a dictionary of medicine and nuclear medicine  related terms.  Very useful for figuring out some of those really obscure  acronyms or alien medical words.  The second section is an invaluable  reference library of all things radioactive and radioisotope related.  Particularly useful is the section on radiopharmaceuticals.  Organized by  radioisotope, it lists the most common pharmaceutical forms each  radioisotope is used for, and gives the form, uses and dosages for  most.<br />Unfortunately, according to Amazon, it appears to be out of print,  and my edition was published in 1990, so newer imaging agents aren't  covered.  Still a valuable resource for the bookshelf of every  medical/health physicist, radiologist and technician.	2000-05-17

I consider myself a fairly accomplished baker and cook, although I'm not a professional.  Nevertheless, all of the recipes in  this book that I tried were complete flops.  It made me wonder if any of  the recipes had been kitchen tested at all.  None of the recipes I selected  were terribly complicated.  The Chocolate Chip Hazelnut cookies I tried  looked all right to start, but they came out resembling something more like  a puff pastry, but not nearly as appetizing.  The chocolate macaroons were  soggy and gooey, not at all like the picture in the book.  The gingerbread  squares came out dense, heavy and pretty much inedible.  The pictures are  very nice to look at, but I fear that's all this book may be good for.	1999-12-17
