A must for anyone traveling in a RV.  AAA does not have a book as comprehensive as Woodall's.  Every campground in North America is in here.  The only drawback is its size...large and heavy.

The story sounds predictable with an American writer escaping to Italy impulsively buying a fixer-upper in the country.  Sounds familiar?  Sounds like the plot for Under the Tuscan Sun, only this version is from a man who has the knack for comedy.  Doran is the writer and producer of the tv hit Wonder Years.  The Reluctant Tuscan has the feel of Peter Mayle's travel diaries but with more story than diary.  Would be great for a light summer read.	2005-04-18

So, it is very very petty for a reviewer to trash a book based on finding a few typos in the book.  As far as this book is concerned, I found very little.  Now focusing on the more important issue - what does this book teaches - positive belief in yourself.  This is combined with activities that help develop self-esteem and creativity.  There are some detail instructions and recipes, besides suggestions on what to do.  The fact that it ties back to the Gifted Girls Series is an added bonus.  Young girls should get this book more for the message and for the activities.  It is a fun book that is written, designed, and meant to be taken in fun.  Highly recommended.	2005-01-02

Katie Meier's book has a long title, and surprisingly covers a lot - spirituality, body image, peer pressure, and more.  Very similar to most non-fiction girl's books, Meier gives the advice in a big sister way.  What separates this book from others?  It actually goes into scripture and is not afraid to be frank about religion, as well.  That in itself, unlike a lot of girl's non-fiction books which shy away from one of the most important aspect in a girl's life (their emotional and spiritual side), makes this book true to itself and 5 stars.

This is a side imaginatively told, of a young Cleopatra who must rise to lead a weak Egypt.  How does this relate back to Lucy?  Lucy is in a quest to find her explorer father.  Through her gift and through her journey back in time to find her father, Lucy learns about bravery and courage.  This is not your typical girl's book where everything is sunny and bright, but a book that reminds you of a shorter version of a Wrinkle in Time.  And it is charming.  Mrs. Potter and her dog Mr. Smithy is vivid and lovable.  Lucy is spunky, and Nellie Ham is funny.  When I read the Emily Cobbs Collection, another character in the Gifted Girls Series, I was compelled to read the Lucy books.  In Emily Cobbs, the Explorer Society becomes more prominent, and there is more of a backstory on the Gifted Girls.  A wonderful new series that have been under the radar, but has caught the attention of schools and parents since it is among the recommendation lists.  My younger sister loves this series.	2004-12-28

But we're constantly reminded of it when we go through security checks at the airport and watch the news.  Lucy and the Liberty Quilt takes place at the time of September 11, detailing the event from a 12 year old's point of view.  At a time of crisis and chaos when grown ups are reduced to a state of shock and helplessness, Lucy and her family find hope and safety through prayer.  Although she is just a 12 year old, Lucy is empowered by the discovery she has a role to play as one of the Gifted Girls.  Through imagination and through symbolism, Lucy's self-esteem and confidence is strengthen so that she can be propel into action and not let fear control her.  Though some may not get the subtlety of this smart series, Lucy and the other Gifted Girls books are deeper than other books for girls, but has adventure and enough issues like friendship and growing up that would keep the interest of any girl up to age 13 or 14.

Can a father be more protective?  An interesting twist on the popular Spiderman comic books and now movies, Spider-Girl is a logical sequel for the next generation crowd.  Like Spiderman, she has all the powers, and like Spiderman, she has all his problems, too - including his old enemies.  Maybe this may get more girls to read comics, graphic novels, or books about strong superheroines, but maybe it may cause diehard Spiderman fans who want to see Spiderman forever youthful without a child to cringe.  Nevertheless, with few really good superheroines out there besides Wonder Woman, Buffy, Queen B Superheroine, or Elektra, Spiderman's daughter may just catch on.	2004-12-28

This book profiles several.  Focusing on women in history who were extraordinary before they turned 20, this book highlights heroines such as Cleopatra and Phyllis Wheatley among others.  A good collection since the greatness of these women have always been played down throughout history.  Cleopatra, who is one of the world's most fascinating women and my personal favorite, especially.  An inspiring book.  Also recommended if you enjoy reading about important historical female women - Lucy and the Beauty Queen (a fictional book about a young Cleopatra) and the Emily Cobbs Collection which references a young Queen Victoria.	2004-12-28

From the rock-climber to the athlete, this inspiring book will provide good examples for any teen.  As such, Tina Schwager's book portrays real life teens.  But for fun, you can also get inspired by reading about fictional heroines like Buffy or Queen B Superheroine.  The more examples of strong, confident young heroines out there for tween and teen girls to read about, the better.	2004-12-28

His books often are slightly dark, but triumphant in a way that remind you of Lemony Snicket and Harry Potter.  In this tale, however, James is an orphan living with horrible aunts.  He escapes his horrible existence when he climbs aboard a peach that keeps growing and growing.  Delightful in that he gets to live in a peach, and everything in the peach including a worm gets to become James' size as well.  Also recommended are Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events and the Emily Cobbs Collection.	2004-12-28

Now in this work of non-fiction and reflection, you get to go behind the books to learn what the author of such fiction A Wrinkle in Time and the Austin Family Series think about combining art and faith.  Her reflections are again inspiring and raise the art of religious fiction to social acceptance.  While others may think the elements of her novels - time travel and use of magic may be considered mysticism, many praise L'Engle's books as promoting faith and  spirituality through a clever, imaginative story full of symbolism.  Look underneath the children's books, and you will find an essay of hope and inspiration.  For more readings combining faith and art for children, read the Gifted Girls Series, The Chronicles of Narnia, and all of Madelein L'Engle's teenage books.	2004-12-28

Although I missed the tv making of the book, I find the Samantha book a near classic for Christmas.  The victorian times is among one of my favorites so this series by the American Girls became my favorite.  This series is very innocent and sweet about the daily life of a normal victorian girl, but it touches on the authenticity of the victorian era just as the Emily Cobbs series in the Gifted Girls books, but without the mystery and adventure.  Samantha is a little young for my 13 year old sister because of its simplicity in story, but alright for younger readers up to 10.	2004-12-27

Gossip Girl has superficial characters you don't care about, but at least they are entertaining gossip about.  The A-List is like reading about an overexposed A-list celebrity on a reality TV Show, who hams it up on tv as though they're in a show.  In other words, not very realistic teen fare.  But not without redemption, this series will find an audience just like reality tv shows have.	2004-12-26

You don't get a sense of depth in any of the characters, but at the same time, you don't care to.  They are the object of gossip, so you only get the superficial surface-level information about each character so they are meaningful only in their use.  As a reader, you become part of a \\"Mean Girls\\" culture, reveling in the juicy and not very nice gossip of others.  But, it is entertaining, if you like to hear gossip about and from the superrich, superspoil gossip girls who would befriend you only to gossip behind your back.  Maybe a good gossip magazine like People would be better.	2004-12-26

But the interaction between Lana, Clark, and the whole \\"Scooby Doo Gang\\" Chloe and Pete, even Whitney with the girl gives this story a soft touch.  The story of a girl who has wings, but is afraid of flying ties into Clark's fear of flying.  Cherie Bennett wrote a satisfying Smallville book, and books this length, though some consider \\"short\\" are not a distractor.	2004-12-20

She has this ability, but hates using it, and doesn't do anything spectacular with it that warrants it as a freak-of-a-week episode.  Clark and Lex falls for this Spanish teacher (although there is nothing really amazing like special powers through kryptonite to get everyone to fall for her), and have Clark (who is hopelessly in love with Lana) fall for her is unbelievable.  Having built up Clark's strength of character to have him go after his Spanish teacher, despite the way he feels about Lana, is unbelievable.  He even gets into a fighting jealous rage when Lex falls for the Spanish teacher, too.  Anyone who has watched Smallville, even for one season, knows this is nonsense.	2004-12-20

Though it is based on the first episode, Michael Teitelbaum was able to capture the episode into a teen book that still entertains, is true to the television show, and manages to give you more insight into the background of each character.

Set in the beginning of Smallville (First Season), Colon has almost completely ignored the relationships forged in the first season television show.  Yes, Clark and Lex are friends, but that is the extent of anything Smallville.  In this book, Clark runs away and lives in the city with a ragtag bunch of runaways.  He gets involve in their criminal ways, and falls for one of the runaways, a grungy tough street girl.  There is very little mention of Lex, Chloe, Lana or Pete.  But worse, Clark seems out of character.  In most cases, when Clark is out of character, he is affected by red kryptonite or even kryptonite.  Here, there isn't kryptonite to affect him, but he acts reckless and irresponsible.  For Smallville fans, this is a letdown.	2004-12-20
