Everything is described so briefly.  I hesitate to call is succinct because it really doesn't delve deep into the culture.  The topics covered are very superficial and it makes the culture look very transparent.<br />The book just barely gives you enough information to be a tad bit familiar with French culture but by all means will not prepare you for any immersion into French culture.<br />I've seen worse books than this, though.

Unfortunately, this kind of child abuse occurs everyday.<br />I commend David Pelzer for writing this book in a dignified way.  He writes as if from the point of view of the child and it should definitely help adults to understand the struggle and mentality of a child that experiences vicious and cruel treatment especially at the hands of someone they love.<br />You must read this to enrich your life.

Hillary Clinton has always been an enigmatic public figure.  She was like no other First Lady we knew.  She had those who loved her and those who hated her.  She discusses btoh her public life and private life from youth to adulthood.  <br />This book was very well-written.  We can see how her childhood has molded her values today.  She discusses his faith and how much it plays a part in her life.  Heart wrenching is her remembrance of the sex scandal of which her husband was involved.  However, understanding where her heart truly made her humanity more visible to all of us.  Her vulnerability showed and we can all feel like she is not larger-than-life as we did before but is just like each and every one of us but with an inner drive that has excelled her in so many of her dreams.<br />This book is a wonderful read.  We truly get a different insight on a woman who has been the focus of so much controversy.  This time, there's no speculation or hearsay.  We hear it straight from her.  She tells it straight.  This is history in the making.  She is living history.	2003-06-10

We all understand the fear and struggle when asked to follow God's plan but we know that he will bring us through.  That is what this song is about.  It is one of the most beautiful Christmas songs ever written!<br />The story that Amy Grant writes to accompany the song is heart-wrenching.  It's a modern-day version of the song.  This song will bring comfort to anyone going through trials.  This is an especially great gift fot expecting mothers.<br />I highly recommend this CD/book to all customers.

I have always admired Bob Paris for his health and fitness and was equally amazed at his coming out.  It was a great testimony of rising above the homophobia of his industry.<br />This book was his and former partner Rod's on-going chronicle of the development of their relationship.  It would have been great...had it been another couple.  I mean no disrespect but this was the most co-dependent couple that has ever written a book about relationships.  You may have to read it to believe it.<br />I was not surprised when they later announced their public &quot;divorce.&quot;  The formula for their relationship was a disaster waiting to happen.  Perhaps Mr. Paris should write a follow-up book about what lessons he's learned from that experience.  This would help others who have thought that his last relationship was something to be modeled after to learn that there is a much better way for relationships to run.<br />The book is an easy read.  The content however is a little hard to swallow but it's a real memoir.  It would be an interesting study on co-dependent relationships.  Read this book for what it is--a memoir, not a how-to book.	2002-11-13

Never has a fiction book brought me to anger, laughter, sadness, joy and tears as this book did when I first read it 10 years ago.  10 years later, I am still feeling the emotional impact of the story.  <br />This book is not only about slavery; it's about the relationships between people, the psychological mind of a person who has been taught that they cannot think, the innocent wisdom of children.  <br />The novel is an easy read.  The themes are not simple nor are they easy to digest for some but the emotional power of the story truly carries the reader through a historical whirlwind of justice and ethics.	2002-10-21

I completely disagree with the previous reviewers who wrote negatively about this book.  From the very first page of the introduction through the end of this text book, I was so impressed at the thoroughness in covering aspects of culture in America, especially that of students in today's school system.<br />A reviewer complained that it didn't give any solutions for solving problems in schools.  First of all, this textbook presents the facts and information.  A student is to take the problems that these students face and use them to find solutions.  Sometiems the solutions are quite obvious.  However, you must realize that giving people the solutions without explaining the reasons why first is quite dangerous and extremely ignorant.  If solution book is what you are looking for, read C.M. Charles' &quot;Building Classroom Discipline&quot; (7th Edition).<br />But even that book doesn't over the diverse cultures that our schools contain today.  The editors/authors of this book were very inclusive in writing compiling this textbook and I highly commend them and highly recommend them to you.<br />This book covers the different struggles that different groups encounter, their origins, the reasons why they have sustained or haven't and why it is important to acknowledge the multiculturalism in our schools.  Whoever didn't &quot;get&quot; this book obviously didn't understand what the title meant.

So, you wonder what the title of this book is about.  At first glance, I thought it was an unusual title.  What does dancing have anything to do with evangelism?  Why would I want to read a book on evangelism?  Does it work?  Don't people get freaked out when you start &quot;evangelizing&quot; to them anyway?<br />This book will change your mind immediately on the whole concept of evangelism.  It uses the metaphor of dancing to discuss evanglism.  Huh?  Well, think of it this way: Sharing the love of God with people is not easy.  Neither is teaching someone how to dance.  You must take small steps first and lead them slowly.  <br />A lot of what we see in evangelism out there is more like wrestling than dancing.  Who wants to wrestle over issues and how would that lead someone to God?  Wrestling is not a beautiful thing to watch but a dance between two people is.  This book takes you through the beautiful process of evangelism as a dance.  <br />I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE.  This is THE effective way of evangelism.  Brow beating someone is a waste of energy and does more hurt than healing.  (Think about it!)  Check out this book.  It's an easy read!  It truly is.  Very Christian-centered but friendly to all Christians at any reading level.  Doesn't get overly spiritual or heavy on indoctrination.  It is Christ-centered and tells you in simple terms.  Why do book authors always feel liek they need to sound more intelligent than they really are?  Just say it!  This book says it like it is.  Like I said.  A very easy read.

As I read this book, I felt as if I were in the mind of Mr. Behrman or at least following in his shadow through all his experiences.  The emotional rollercoaster I experienced while reading this book made me question my own sanity at times.  In many ways, I felt like this was my story and in others, I couldn't imagine being in the emotional predicaments that he was in.  <br />I felt the fast-paced world that he lived but what was quite impressive was how the thoughts in his mind raced like scenes from 10 different movies all playing in fast-forward all at once.  The genius of mania manifested itself through the pages of this book.  <br />The book covers his years of emotional turmoil as he fights within himself to keep on top in a hyperspeed world.  He tries to beat the system that we all fall victim to and succeeds...until he's caught, all the while trying to control his mental chaos with sex, drugs and alcohol.<br />Live the vicarious life by reading this book!  Get into the frantic psyche of the manic depressive.  Spontaneously travel the world overnight on a whim.  Experience the multitude of sexual encounters that lead from the darkest of areas to the highest of society.  Get swept up in the deluge of cash flow and the inexplicable numbness when spending thousands of dollars on un-needed purchases. Feel the rush of beating the system and the sudden impact of being trapped with no where to go when discovered.	2002-10-07
