That's not really a criticism of the author: Frugality in the kitchen is largely a matter of common sense, and she has managed to put together a good, basic primer.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is that the recipes, which take up half the book, were singularly uninspired. If you have very plain \\"Midwestern\\" tastes or picky kids, they might be appealing, but they wouldn't fly at all in this foodie family. Luckily, it's not all that hard to come up with easy recipes for fresh, frugal meals. Any of Jack Bishop's cookbooks will put you on the right track.	2005-06-29

About half weigh in with carb counts of 30-60 g. per serving. That's more than many low-carb dieters eat in a whole day!<br /><br />The author explains that she considers a diet of 130-150 g. of carbs per day \\"low-carb.\\" This is the type of vegetarian diet that made many of us fat in the first place! There's a reason that most of the popular diet plans call for daily net carb consumption of only 20-50 grams: Clinical experience has shown that higher carb counts simply won't do the job for people who have a substantial amount of weight to lose.<br /><br />This might be a useful book for people on a maintenance plan, who  want to take off 10 lbs., or who just want to cut out \\"white food\\" (processed sugar and flour) from their diet. The recipes do look tasty! But it's not going to be very useful for the many people who are looking to lose significant amounts of weight and need to restrict their carbs to lower levels to do so.	2005-04-30

It strikes the perfect balance in presenting traditional and Messianic interpretations of the holidays and is written with great sensitivity to those of differing backgrounds.

Written primarily for Christians, it gives background on traditional Jewish observance as well as Messianic interpretations for believers in Yeshua.<br /><br />I had three problems with this book, which is why I rated it only 3 stars. One was the somewhat amateurish layout - it was clearly self-published - which made some pages difficult to read. Another was the sheer bulk of the book. This is a large-format paperback and is very unwieldy to read. I needed to sit at a table! The last was price. The price is perhaps reasonable given the size of the book and printing costs, but it's an awful lot of money for information that is much more economically presented elsewhere.<br /><br />If you are just looking for a practical, concise introduction to the holidays, including music and craft suggestions, I'd recommend you get Barry Kasdan's _God's Appointed Customs_ and skip this book altogether. However, if you are a homeschooling family that enjoys unit studies and you agree with the Heart of Wisdom philosophy, this book is a must-have and the price is probably justified, as the studies go across the whole curriculum and could easily fill a whole year.	2004-07-28

Then stick with your old Utne Readers. There's nothing in this book you won't find there, and dozens of other places. Do you really need another book to tell you to recycle and watch less TV?<br /><br /> The authors, although they decry the holier-than-thou attitude of some of their activist peers, fall prey to the same illness. In the first few pages, they dismiss the majority of Americans - that is, Christians - by announcing that if you believe that human nature is the cause of our troubles, you're part of the problem. (Ever hear of original sin?) They assume that their readers have unlimited money to drop on organic bok choi and shoes with hemp content, but they miss obvious healthy and frugal options like breastfeeding. They'll tell you how to be an activist in the public schools, but not about homeschooling. The shopping guide - which is available on their Web site for free, by the way - ranks corporations so that you can make the most politically correct choices. Of course, there's little to tell you what criteria were used for these judgment calls, you don't really need to think for yourself, do you? Just march in lock-step with your progressive peers and the world will be a better place.<br /><br /> If you really want to change the world without changing the root of our problems - the human heart - save your money and donate it to a reputable charity instead. But if you want to score a date with that vegan, World Bank-protesting hottie, this book will teach you the right noises to make.	2004-07-24

Once you have the context for the &quot;difficult words,&quot; certain thorny doctrinal issues have to be faced. The authors show how doctrinal principles like pacifism/nonresistence cannot legitimately be derived from the gospels. You'll also learn what Jesus meant by his saying that he came to &quot;fulfill&quot; the law - and you'll be left to decide for yourself what that &quot;jot and tittle&quot; reference means for contemporary Christian practice.<br />This is a very brief text, concise in its arguments. Much of the meat of the book is actually in the long appendix. I was left wanting much, much more - including a working knowledge of Hebrew. This book will challenge and inspire you. Highly recommended!	2004-06-17

Laura Berquist has done all the legwork for busy homeschooling parents, bringing together a lovely selection of poetry and organizing it according to the stages of the trivium. Selections for the rhetorical stage include study questions, so the book could double as a literature text in the upper grades.<br />One note to clear up a misconception by another reviewer: This isn't meant to be a comprehensive poetry anthology for reading aloud - plenty of these are available - but rather a sourcebook for classical language arts. It's an attractive enough book, with black-and-white line drawings on some pages, but not a decorative one; that's not its purpose. The emphasis is on language throughout, not visuals. But that's part of the appeal for classical homeschoolers.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful time-saving resource for your classical homeschool.	2003-10-09

I bought this book after having my interest piqued by a simple pattern for a farmyard playmat in Debbie Bliss's _Toy Knits_. _Knitted Gardens_ takes the same idea--patchwork squares in different colors and textures--and runs with it.<br />Messent gives ideas for a garden pillow (adorned with miniature knitted vegetables), an elaborate bedpread, cottages, and even a monastery garden complete with friars. Although patterns are included, the value of this book lies in its power to inspire the knitter to design and experiment with whatever s/he has on hand. (What a great way to use up your oddments... and make room for more stash!) Some of the most interesting ideas mix knit, crochet, and needlepoint for an unusually wide range of textures and styles. Most of the stitches are basic enough for beginners, but the open-ended designs will also hold the interest of more experienced knitters.<br />And here's a secret: grownups enjoy these lighthearted designs at least as much as the kids do.	2002-01-29

She covers all the essential topics--narration, living books--in detail and also includes chapters on how she has approached picture study, music appreciation, and Shakespeare with her children. Her personal stories and responses to readers' questions make the book, and Miss Mason's method, very &quot;user-friendly&quot; to the average busy home school parent.<br />Readers should be aware of a number of biases in this book, however. Mrs. Andreola assumes that her audience is made up solely of Christian mothers. Being neither, I sometimes found this off-putting, but perhaps I am the exception that proves the rule. Also, please do not take all of her historical statements at face value, particularly those about ancient civilizations. She writes, for example, that &quot;[t]he Golden Age of Greece was a time of peace&quot;--except for those pesky Persian and Peloponnesian wars, of course. She also suggests that while the Greeks were a poetic people, the decadent Romans had no appreciation for poetry...Virgil? Ovid?<br />But these are minor quibbles with an otherwise outstanding book. The writing is elegant (unlike some other introductions to CM), the tone uplifting, and the ideas true to Miss Mason's own writings. I applaud Mrs. Andreola's work on behalf of Miss Mason and heartily recommend _A Charlotte Mason Companion_ to anyone looking into this practical and sane home schooling method.	2001-11-24

It contains all the up-to-date nutrition information you need to make smart food choices on a plant-based diet. The authors manage to do something that few health writers can: they write for the lay reader without dumbing things down. So, as well as summarizing the data on vegan nutrition, they analyze the strong and weak points of the various studies--which are often based on very small numbers of vegan participants.  If you are looking for a cookbook or a book that details the evils of the animal food industry and other philosophical and ethical reasons to become vegan, this is not it. But if you are looking for nutritional facts and advice on putting together a healthful diet at any stage of like, you won't be disappointed in this book.	2001-07-25

These are real, authentic, naturally vegan recipes from the different Mediterranean nations, not imitations that rely on faux meats or obscure Asian condiments (tasty as those things can be in the right context).<br />You'll find some old favorites here, like a variety of bean- and tomato-based crostini toppings or minestrone, as well as some interesting treats--my personal favorite is the rich and moist currant cake, made with light olive oil. Many of the recipes are Italian, but a good number are from less well-known cuisines, such as Catalan and Provencal. There are relatively few Middle Eastern or Greek recipes, but these cuisines are already well-represented in so many other cookbooks, that I didn't miss them.<br />Klein gives a lot of helpful hints along the way: nutritional information about each recipe, cook's tips, menu ideas, and substitutions for the few fresh vegetables (e.g., fava beans) and other ingredients that may be hard to find outside of major cities.<br />This is a cook-your-way-through cookbook!

No one escapes his righteous wrath: circuit queens, leather daddies, transgender warriors, televangelists, skater punks, pomo-homo academics--even the Devil himself. They're all here, in glorious technocolor (and in various states of undress).<br />_See Dick Deconstruct_ fills a much-neglected literary niche--one-handed reading for the hopelessly erudite. This is writing that takes seriously the idea that the brain is the largest sex organ. But even if you don't get hot and bothered over French lit crit or Latin love poetry, you will get caught up in the sheer force of Philips' prose, his marvelously developed characters, and his wicked sense of humor. Not to mention the copious raunchy sex.<br />What's more, Philips is not afraid of four-letter words, like L-O-V-E. Hidden among the satiric barbs is some genuine romance, a tender sweetness that reminds us that piggy sex is grand, but piggy sex with someone you love is, well, what most of us are looking for, gay or straight.<br />If this what Philips is offering as a debut, what can we expect in 5 or 10 years? Gay literati, look out: there's a new luminary in your midst and he is taking notes.	2001-05-24

Like his other titles, _Becoming a Father_ emphasizes early bonding, positive discipline, and respect for the child's physical and emotional needs. To the extent that all fathers need to hear this message, this is an excellent book.  So why the low rating? Because despite his child-positive message, Dr. Sears is caught in a time warp when it comes to models of masculinity. Underlying his arguments for an active role for fathers are assumptions that this reader found frustratingly rigid and occasionally downright offensive. An example:<br />&quot;The growing child should see that important family matters require a mutual decision-making process that involves both mom and dad, but I believe that dad is primarily responsible for making decisions.&quot; (p. 194)<br />  Even more troubling is the author's attitude toward homosexuality, which seems to be informed more by conservative religious values than by current medical knowledge:<br />&quot;'I don't want my son to grow up to be a pansy,' exclaimed John, a new father. His sentiments are shared by most men.&quot; (p. 200)<br />  For those readers who aren't already aware of the meaning--or should I say &quot;demeaning&quot;?--of this slur, Dr. Sears goes on to define a &quot;pansy&quot; as &quot;an effeminate boy.&quot; Given the author's 1950s-style ideas of masculinity, I'd hate to think how he would judge a boy who, after watching his father wearing a younger sibling in a sling, asked for a doll to play with. He concludes:<br />&quot;I am personally concerned that our society tends to approve of lifestyles [sic!] such as homosexuality. Society sees this as an 'acceptable alternative.' I can accept a person as a homosexual without having to approve of the morality of homosexuality.&quot; (p. 208)<br />  If this &quot;love the sinner, hate the sin&quot; attitude reflects your own beliefs, you will probably get a lot out of this book. But if you take a more egalitarian view of male-female relationships and don't believe--and most mainstream doctors do not--that weak paternal role models &quot;cause&quot; homosexuality, you may want to look elsewhere for advice on fathering.  To be fair, there is much of value in this book, but the truly helpful ideas can be gleaned from Sears's array of other works (such as _The Baby Book_) or from other attachment parenting guides, like Katie Granju's _Attachment Parenting_.you will probably get a lot out of this book.

(The Vesh are back!) Just when we  think that leather can't shock us anymore, Califia gives us &quot;The Cop  and His Choirboy&quot; (penned with partner Matt Rice), an odyssey into the  world of a corrupt police officer and the hustler whose love may redeem  him, and &quot;Skinned Alive,&quot; a chilling dystopian meditation on  barebacking.<br />Califia's writing is still sharp and shiny, studded with the  wry humor that has become the author's trademark. Yet this collection is  perhaps the author's most deeply personal, exploring gender, spirit, and  the meeting place between love and loss.<br />As always, Califia's work  excites on many levels.
