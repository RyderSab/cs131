The novel's social interest lies mainly in its depiction of Apartheid from two non-native perspectives: Frieda and her family are not overtly racist, but they acquiesce to the system (\\"It's just the way things are\\"); Min, on the other hand, devotes her life to fighting for racial justice.  The personal growth that Frieda undergoes as a result of meeting Min is superbly developed by Pamela Jooste.  The novel is well-written throughout, but switches between Frieda's and Min's perspectives and frequent movements forward and backward through time can be a little confusing.  Overall, however, this book is worth the time to read.	2002-05-30

It is basically a series of portraits of people that were either important in Thurber's family history, important in Columbus, Ohio from the 1910's to the 1930's, or his journalist friends from Columbus.  Thurber had a subtle sense of humor, and he uses it to full effect in describing the sometimes outrageous activities of his subjects.  The anecdotal history of Columbus that is slowly revealed proved to be quite interesting (I'm a native of central Ohio).<BR>  Each chapter did end on what at first seemed to be an overly sappy note; however, this is understandable since the book was first published in the early 1950's, when such things were probably expected by Thurber's audience.  Overall, this was a very fun read.	2001-12-29

Everywhere I went, this guide pointed out pleasant places that ordinary travel guides might not bother with.  The lists of accomodation and restaurants in every city or town were especially useful.  Interspersed throughout are historical and cultural notes that allow the visitor to enjoy each place just a little bit more, and Gareth Powell's dry wit makes the guide very readable.  My one disappointment was the comparative lack of attention to Brisbane (where I spent most of my time).  For instance, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth all have detailed, color street maps at the back of the book, but Brisbane does not. Overall, however, this guide was well worth its price.	2001-05-02

The Aboriginal song poems have been ably translated, but the editors decided to have the poems in their original languages facing the English versions.  This adds much to the feel of a foreign, exotic literature.  Explanatory notes are placed with the original versions, causing some difficulty in switching from page to page reading the translation and then the explanation (the meanings of passages are not always clear from the translation).  The selections cover four distinct literary traditions within Aboriginal Australia, from varying geographical locales.  This allows the reader to appreciate the wide variation in Aboriginal culture.	2001-05-02

I picked this book up at a Salvation Army store for about 50 cents, and I'm glad that's all I paid.  I have no problem with strong female warrior types, but Jirel does not do them justice.  As the editorial review notes, Jirel is a little stupid, and it is often her uncontrolled emotions rather than her courage or her bravery that get her out of sticky situations.  As a heroin, I just couldn't bring myself to root for her to win.  My biggest complaint, however, is the lack of other characters in most of the stories, especially the Black God stories.  Moore undoubtedly spent a great deal of time writing 30 pages of description of strange alien worlds, but after the first 10 pages they get a little boring.  A good story needs more than one character to keep up the reader's interest.  In this respect, the final story in this collection, Hellsgarde, was a pretty good story, and much easier to read because there were several interesting characters.	2001-04-19

Rather, they are meant to provide cheap introductions for beginners or slim volumes for those who wish to appear intellectual.  They are also just another volume to collect for (in this case) Poe completists.  That having been said, I love Dover thrift editions precisely because they are so cheap and provide easy access to the most famous works by reknowned authors.  This particular volume delivers, including both Poe's most famous works of poetry (The Raven, Annabel Lee, The Bells, etc.) and some less-well-known works.	2001-03-24

The writing was poor, the plot was hackneyed and cliche (for the most part), and the editing was absolutely atrocious.  It seemed like there were at least two typos, mispellings or other assorted miscues on every page.  The writing style reminded me of fan fiction (if you're not familiar with fanfic, this comparison is not at all favorable).  The author also got a few facts wrong (such as, Cleveland is nowhere near Wright-Patterson Air Force Base).  As for the plot, it is the typical UFO skeptic-turned-believer-trying-to-rescue-family-member-and-uncover-vast-government-conspiracy plot.  It became vaguely interesting towards the end, but I won't reveal the (almost) plot twist for those intrepid readers who might want to read this book.    This novel is technically the second in a trilogy, but according to the author it can be enjoyed on its own.  After wincing my way through this volume, I have no desire to read the other two.  However, I give this book two stars instead of one simply because it is the perfect thing for mindless airport reading.	2001-01-03

Accordingly, almost every poem has as its theme war, death, the sea or love lost or gone awry.  It makes for a coherent whole, but it can get depressing.  It takes awhile to actually get into the poems, and the rhythm is hard to pick up at first.

The  footnotes to &quot;The Waste Land&quot; alone take up 4 and 1/2 pages, and  a lot of them are quotations in Latin.  There are also a few poems written  in French, with no translations for those readers who might not happen to  be familiar with that language.  Also, surely the editor(s) could have come  up with a few more poems by such an important poet. I suppose the meager  selection was chosen in anticipation of readers' wearied minds after  trudging through such heavy work.  All the same, it is T.S. Eliot, and  there are good reasons why &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and  &quot;Prufrock&quot; are considered classics.	2000-08-20

Some claim he was a great forward-thinking emancipator (he  originally planned to let the southern states have until 1900 to abolish  slavery on an individual-state basis), while others claim he was never  really interested in ending slavery at all (in fact, as early as 1838  Lincoln made it clear that he thought the only practical way of ending  slavery was to contain it where it already existed, so that it would then  eventually die out). These are only examples.  These speeches, however, are  Lincoln's definitive statement, from his own mouth, of what he did and did  not stand for.  They are a bit tedious to read (and would obviously work  better as speeches), but anyone who is interested in Abraham Lincoln and  the Civil War should read this book.	2000-08-17

I must admit that before reading it, I knew nothing at all about the WoD, Rage, or even White Wolf Studios.  I  picked it up at a used book sale because it looked slightly interesting,  but because it is based on a card game I didn't expect it to be any better  than a second-rate novel.  Boy, was I wrong.  The plot was interesting, the  characters were fascinating (and kudos on the sensitive handling of the gay  issue), and Bassingthwaite's anthropological training shone through  admirably in his great depictions of the Garou tribal system.  The only  problem for me was the large number of obvious typos within the text, but  that is most likely the editor's fault, not the author's.	2000-07-27

I must admit, I'd never heard that Campbell's work was New Age garbage that is not accepted by most scholars.  This book is copiously footnoted, allowing the reader to go to the sources if he/she is not satisfied with  the conclusions.  Campbell certainly demonstrates an incredible knowledge  of mythology from around the entire world, and he weaves stories together  seamlessly.  As for the complaint that he picks and chooses examples to  support his ideas while ignoring the rest of the evidence: Campbell admits  in this book that not every single myth fits his formula exactly, but a  great many do.  He simply couldn't include all of these examples, because  that would have made the book far too long.  All of this aside, I did have  one problem: Campbell relies far too much on the work of early  psychoanalysts (especially Freud and Jung) to interpret symbolism in  mythology.	2000-07-25

One of the comments on the back cover says it pretty aptly: &quot;A compassionate, shattering character study, more short story than play.&quot;  This is basically a 30-page monologue by one of the  characters, with an occasional interjection by the other.  It centers  around the feelings of Erie (the main character) for the previous night  clerk at the hotel where he lives (Hughie), who has died. I found it hard  to really like Erie, and I was disappointed with the sudden transformation  of the new Night Clerk at the end.  However, it has to be said that this  play would be great for choosing a monologue for acting class or an  audition.	2000-07-25

Yep, this book is actually a thoughtful (and scientifically researched) examination of what &quot;the end of the world&quot; might cause.  There were some extraneous characters and the ruminations of the survivors  sometimes ran a bit long (as does the book--640 pages), but overall this  was a very engaging read.  I'm not quite sure why some reviewers thought  the depiction of cannibalism in this book was so graphic or so disturbing.   In my opinion, it was neither.  Cannibalism is a real phenomenon, and the  description of the &quot;ritual&quot; was far from horrific.	2000-07-23

When I saw this book in the library, I figured I'd give it a shot over Christmas break.  It was  not a waste of time.  This is a thoughtful and well-written book which  points out many obvious (and some not-so-obvious) instances of  androcentrism in both the study and practice of archaeology.  There are a  few places where it seemed that Nelson was about to fall into the trap of  gynocentrism which she rightly denounces as being just as bad as  androcentrism.  However, she usually catches herself in time.  I am very  glad I decided to read this book, because it has given me a new perspective  from which to evaluate the material I will read in the future.	2000-01-14

It read very fluently and was more captivating than most biographies.  L'Enfant noir is a wonderful example of the movement known as La Negritude, and it is the best French-language book I  have ever read.	2000-01-13

However, I am also willing to admit when he produces a sub-par work.  While Homebody was interesting enough to read (and better than most of the mainstream garbage  turned out today), it did not measure up to Card's typical standards.  At  the end of the book, it just felt that something was missing.  Part of that  feeling was that the character of Cindy Claybourne, who was rather integral  to the first part of the book, was left high and dry in the conclusion (as  other reviewers have mentioned). So if you're a big OSC fan, then of course  buy this book.  But if you're looking for an introduction to OSC's work,  start elsewhere.	2000-01-13

Acting is generally seen as a cooperative effort, but this collection of monologues proves that wrong.       Usually funny and almost always far more insightful than anything in the movies, this  work takes an often ignored route to exploring contemporary American  culture.  Some people may be offended by the vulgar nature of some of the  monologues (such as Dirt, in which the only word in the first sentence that  is not an obscenity is 'ya'), this very vulgarity is a reality of life that  is necessary to accept in order to understand what Bogosian has to say.	2000-01-13
