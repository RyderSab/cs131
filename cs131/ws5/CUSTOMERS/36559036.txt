Perhaps \\"vital\\" is too mild a term for it.  The moral law is almost entirely neglected today, in religious and secular circles.  And yet the moral law is the silent and invisible mechanism that slowly shapes our eternal destiny.  It is the very character of Almighty God.  The fear and love of the moral law will keep us on the path of life, keep us seeking forgiveness, keep us from harming others, keep us from harming ourselves, keep us from being shallow, and keep us dependent upon our Creator.	2005-10-11

Perhaps for that reason it requires the greatest meditation and reflection.  And intelligent commentary can be of great assistance in this process. <br /> <br />Chad Foster approaches John from a helpful and innovative angle.  By examining the apologetic aims of the Apostle, he sheds new light on some enigmatic passages.   <br /> <br />In particular, Dr. Foster's treatment of the apologetic force of the \\"Logos\\" is very welcome.  He emphasizes the impact that term would have had on Gentile seekers, who already accepted the Logos as the Reason governing the universe.  To identify the Jewish Messiah with the Gentile Logos was a powerful concept, one that the early Roman apologists used to great effect in winning the intellectual battle for the Roman mind.	2005-09-18

With the aid of the newly-catalogued Washington papers, Ellis makes a heroic effort to find the real man. <br /> <br />One small quibble.  I was hoping to learn more about Washington's religious beliefs.  Some scholars have opined that Washington was a deeply pious man in private, but spoke as a Deist in public to avoid offense.  Ellis states in passing, with no quotes or citations, that Washington was \\"never a deeply religious man\\" who thought of God as a \\"distant, impersonal force.\\"  (Page 151)  Perhaps Ellis' next book can explore this side of Washington more fully?	2005-08-27

He was constantly studying, constantly seeking a simple eloquence that could persuade ordinary people to adopt great ideas.  Dr. Briggs ably unpacks Lincoln's speeches, showing Lincoln's increasing rhetorical skill. <br /> <br />Professor Briggs also shows how the substance of Lincoln's ideas improved over time, due no doubt to his same addiction to self-improvement.  Lincoln wrestled with many great issues of his day, including national expansion, economic development, the railroads and the Mexican War.  Finally he grappled with slavery, the immense moral dilemma that the Founders, the Federalists and the Whigs had been unable to solve.   <br /> <br />The Civil War drew upon all the rhetorical skills Lincoln had developed.  His oratory infused the north with moral purpose, a determination that ultimately saved the Union and freed the slaves.  A lifetime of intellectual, moral and rhetorical improvement broke the back of slavery, giving a priceless gift to the nation he loved.  Briggs' study illustrates all this remarkably well.	2005-07-09

Perhaps a large, ancient battery that literally \\"shocked\\" untrained observers?    Dr. Price makes a persuasive case that the Ark of the Covenant was the doorway to Heaven.  It was God's moral perfection directly manifested in a corrupt world.  To those who feared Him, it was a means of mercy and life.  To those who despised Him, it was a means of judgment and death.  It was the center of the Hebrew Covenant with Almighty God.    Dr. Price also conducts the reader through an exhaustive analysis of possible options for the fate of the ark.  In plain language, he carefully examines the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of theories.    Dr. Price's popular writing style can make you forget his impressive academic credentials.  He has a Ph.D. in Middle Eastern Studies and a Masters Degree in Old Testament and Semitic Languages.  He is a learned man, well versed in both the Scriptures and Jewish tradition.

And rightly so -- the Revolution would never have succeeded without the active support of the American establishment. <br /> <br />But Cerami's book approaches the Founding from a fascinating new perspective -- the brashness of two brilliant young men, Madison and Hamilton.  They were both in their 30s, and brought a fresh and aggressive approach to America's difficulties after the war.  The Articles of Confederation were fundamentally flawed; a completely new government was required.  Hamilton and Madison saw this with crystal clarity.  They were anxious to move the process forward, as quickly as possible. <br /> <br />Cerami focuses on this providential nexus between national need and youthful genius.  Had Madison and Hamilton been in their 50s, there would have been no new Constitution.  The Convention would have simply amended the Articles.  The states would have continued in their autonomy and weakness.  And the American experiment would likely have failed.	2005-06-30

They have adopted a small view of God, often known as \\"process theology.\\" God does not know the future, because the future does not yet exist. God is discovering the future along with us.     In this great book, Dr. Ross fully restores the orthodox doctrine of God's transcendence. He does so with the aid of modern physics. Dr. Ross' argument is irrebuttable. Time is just one of the created dimensions. The Creator can see all of time at a single glance, just as He can see the rest of the universe. Our past, present and future are all in the present tense to God. His name, \\"I AM,\\" is more than just semantics!	2005-06-28

With great enthusiasm, Dr. Ross uses the latest scientific discoveries to present a comprehensive case for a Creator. Some complain that he is too quick to discuss the latest scientific theories, such as a 10-dimensional universe. But these theories are taught every day to science students, with a secular spin. Must Christians remain silent until, perhaps 40 years later, these theories have the same level of acceptance as relativity? This would put the church at an immense disadvantage in presenting an appealing, unified world view.	2005-06-25

Today's liberal intellectuals are like spoiled trust-fund children, despising the ancestors who created their inheritance.    Our public schools, our universities and our media constantly point to the flaws of the Catholic Church, often in an exagerated and misleading way.  And it is a totally one-sided presentation, ignoring the far greater weight of good the Catholic Church has brought to the world.  (What individual would want others to know all his or her faults?  Who could live with such a reputation?)    Dr. Woods' book is a valuable corrective to this modern negativity and ingratitude.  It is worth its weight in gold.  It restores much-deserved luster to the Catholic Church.  (I write this as a Protestant.)    Dr. Woods writes a balanced book.  He points out that the Catholic Church did not create western civilization from scratch.  Instead, it borrowed the best of the Greeks and Romans, and added a clear and unified view of natural law.  That strengthened understanding of natural law purged pagan superstition and laid the foundations for modern science.    Finally, Dr. Woods points the way to reversing our cultural decay.  We must remember the moral law -- the neglected half of the natural law.  This catholic doctrine is the mortar that held our culture together for almost two thousand years.  With this same mortar we can rebuild our civilization, from the inside out.	2005-06-25

He uses an old-earth framework to demonstrate the accuracy of Genesis, in a thorough and systematic way I have not seen from other authors.    Of course, this book is not appreciated by young earth creationists, as many of the reviews below attest.  I think most young earth creationists are sincere, though misguided.      The church embarrassed itself once before, rejecting Copernicus and Galileo based upon an overly-literal interpretation of Joshua 10 and other passages stating that the sun moves across the sky.  We should be careful not to make the same mistake a second time.      The Bible is divinely inspired and without error.  But that does not mean that every word and phrase should be read literally.  For example, the Scriptures say that God is a \\"rock.\\"  But no one believes that He is a finite, inanimate piece of stone.  That is figurative language.  But it dramatically and accurately conveys something about God's protection that literal language could not convey.    Moses was not a scientist.  The ancient Israelites did not think in scientific categories.  So we should not expect Genesis to use a literal, scientific framework.  The use of \\"days\\" more accurately conveys, from God's perspective, the relative importance of His creative activity.    On the other hand, for those who prefer to read the creation days as literal 24-hour days, you have an ally in Albert Einstein.  According to his theory of relativity, the speed of time depends upon the speed of the object.  For objects close to the speed of light, the universe may be only weeks, days or even hours old.  Physicist Gerald Schroeder calculates that the universe is literally 7 days old, when measured from the edge of the expanding universe.  See his book Genesis and the Big Bang (Bantam 1990).	2005-06-04

Neil Anderson is no doubt a sincere Christian.  However, his teachings on this subject are harmful, causing believers to doubt one of the chief blessings of the Gospel.      At the heart of Anderson's doctrine is the idea that demons can transmit thoughts into the minds of Christians.  But, unless I missed it, he provides no clear Scriptural support for this astounding theory.  The principal examples he cites are people who were apostates -- Judas and Ananias.  (Page 64)  He gives no Biblical examples of ordinary believers who, after the Resurrection, had thoughts implanted by demons.    Anderson ignores the force of numerous Scripture passages, teaching that Jesus has destroyed the devil's power over believers.  (See e.g. Heb. 2:14; Col. 2:15; Matt. 28:18)    Instead, Anderson takes out of context \\"spiritual warfare\\" verses such as Eph. 6:12.  That was clearly written to believers in Ephesus who were going through human persecution.  Paul reminds them that their battle is not with the people persecuting them, but with demonic power influencing the persecutors.  (Why else would the Ephesians be confused?  Why would they think they were outwardly struggling with people, with \\"flesh and blood,\\" when they were instead inwardly struggling with demonic thoughts?)    It is one thing to teach that demons can indirectly influence Christians, through pagan society.  It is another thing to claim that demons can directly interfere with the thought life of believers.    Anderson's doctrine produces happy nonChristians, and unhappy Christians.  Before Christ, people are ignorant of demonic influences.  After conversion, though, Anderson teaches believers that their minds can be flooded with demonic thoughts.      Are people to accept Christ, only to be told that demons can attack their minds?  This demonic-telepathy doctrine is very disturbing to sensitive and introspective people.  It also conveniently takes the focus off the real problem -- our own selfish motives.  This doctrine bears bad fruit, and cannot be true.      It is unclear why this unsound doctrine has survived so long, and even thrived in many Christian circles.  Perhaps it is due to the short-term benefits pastors see, when congregations have a new-found interest in \\"spiritual things.\\"  Perhaps it is due to the lack of any popular books presenting a contrary view.  Whatever the reason, the reader should proceed with a healthy skepticism.	2005-06-03

Paul Grondahl shows TR's political rise as an explosive combination of two different factors or forces -- one internal and one external. <br /> <br />These forces are on display on the cover of the book.  The title (\\"rose like a rocket\\") suggests the circumstances that quickly propelled TR into political opportunity.  New York, and the nation, were ripe for a patrician reformer.  Yet, as the book makes clear, Roosevelt's life consisted as much of sorrow as of opportunity.  So external events are insufficient to explain his success. <br /> <br />The subtitle (\\"political education\\") suggests the more important factor -- TR's intellectually aggressive approach to life, which enabled him to constantly improve by learning from his mistakes. Roosevelt himself seldom admitted to mistakes.  So it takes a great journalist and historian like Grondahl to extract those lessons for us.  A very enjoyable piece of detective work!	2004-09-25

The result is a surprisingly full picture of a man who tried to leave no personal footprints.  He saw himself as a forerunner for another.  Yet his radical use of baptism as a sign of repentence, apart from the Temple rituals, left an enduring legacy.
