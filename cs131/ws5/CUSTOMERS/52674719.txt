My son's school has DEAR time daily (drop everything and read) and they can read any book from their reading box.  This book cycled it's way to my son and he couldn't stop talking about it!  Apparently the fourth graders beg to have this (and other record books) as one of their choices.  Needless to say - I had to get him his own copy!<br /><br />The book is almost 300 pages with fabulous pictures and some really unusual facts seperated into different categories covering all manner of records from sports to science.  Perfect for skimming, or reading an entire category!<br /><br />Great for kids - and parents too!	2005-03-05

Find out!	This is a great book - a must read for those of us that really want to know what's actually going on in the world!  While I knew there were some \\"leanings\\", it really amazed me to learn how much the New York Times is distorting the news.  Bias is one thing, but some of the articles show little resemblance to what was printed by other media sources covering the same thing.<br /><br />The book describes various techniques - many are very subtle - used by the NY Times to slant a story.  Most you wouldn't even notice!  One thing is certain, after reading this book you will find that you scrutinize every news story you read/hear - and that is not such a bad thing!	2004-11-16

I knew little beyond the meager facts memorized in school and feel this book gives a good portrayal of that period in our history.  Discussion about the war for our independence was quite good and provided me with a better idea why Washington did the things he did.<br /><br />If you've read alot about George Washington already, I doubt this book will provide much new.  However, if you're like me and knew little about him to begin with, this is a super introduction into the life of our First President.	2004-11-14

Just like we always read \\"The Night Before Christmas\\", my family has the tradition of reading \\"The Polar Express\\" on Christmas eve - snuggled in our pjs in front of the fireplace, drinking hot chocolate.  The illustrations in this book are wonderful and the story, while simple, is a warm fuzzy!  For us, this delightful book really helps set the mood for the holidays.<br /><br />I'm sure we will all go see the movie, but I still hope my children will look forward to listening to me read the book this holiday season.<br /><br />If you haven't read the book yet, pick up a copy and maybe start a holiday tradition in your family!

I have been a Quicken user for years and have been happy with all the improvements over time!  Needless to say - I have repeatedly raved about this great software, but my in-laws are computer phobes and have resisted even trying it.<br /><br />I purchased \\"Quicken 2005 for Dummies\\" for them and assured them the book would answer all their questions.  Well, they hemmed and hawed for a few more days, but then tried it out.  It worked like a charm!  Any question they had was answered quickly by the book and they now feel they invented the software!  (You can only imagine how ecstatic they were when they discovered google!).<br /><br />If you are new to quicken, or are already a believer and want to get someone else hooked, this book is really worth it!

I purchased this book because of the extreme opposing reviews here on amazon - I must admit, I was intrigued.  After reading it, I think it is very clear why the reviews are as they are - even though I don't really feel she says anything new in this book.<br /><br />If you are a conservative, you will probably agree with most of what Ann Coulter talks about in the book - think she is super intelligent, that the information in her book was well researched and presents an accurate view of how things really are.<br /><br />If you are a liberal - the title alone will probably set you off.  You will see that Ann is somewhat (tongue in cheek) less than thorough in her view of things and presents liberals in a very bad light.  Again, nothing new from Ms. Coulter.<br /><br />So - who should buy this book?  Pretty much anyone with a strong opinion should check it out.  Republicans will love it, Democrats will hate it - which is probably what Ann intended all along!  Have fun!	2004-11-10

I've always been fond of the Magic Tree House series as these were the books that made my son a reader!  However, after dozens of books, my son started to get tired of the same series and showed no interest in reading the last several books.<br /><br />Inspite of this, I had to buy this book when I saw the cover - a Sea Serpent - that had to be intriguing!  Dreaded mom that I am - I made my son read this book!  He protested for about one minute - and then he was hooked!<br /><br />While the first 20 books or so of the series are for younger readers, the last ones have \\"grown\\" and appeal to the 9 - 12 year old range.  Full of adventure - this series just keeps getting better!<br /><br />If your child thinks they've outgrown this series - pick up a copy of this book - you never know - they may just find themselves hooked once again on the magical adventures of Jack and Annie!	2004-10-31

This is a tough time the United State's faces - high unemployment, unrest in the stock market and around the world, a heated election year plus so much more.  With all the conflicting information the media reports, the different directions we are being pulled in - it is hard to know what to believe - and who to vote for!<br /><br />Election day approaches, and we must decide who will lead us for the next four years.  I recommend reading this book to learn about our current President.  I found this book by Bill Sammon to be well researched.  It gives great insight into the man in the White House and the decisions he has made.<br /><br />No matter who you plan to vote for, it is never a bad thing to have more information.  Alot of misinformation has been going around for years and it is important to get the facts so that we all can make an informed decision!  It really shouldn't be about Republican or Democrat - it should be about having the best President in office to lead our country.  Hopefully the information in this book will make it a little easier to decide!	2004-10-31

As one of those people who never did figure out what I should do after highschool, I ended up getting a master's degree in a field I disliked and worked for years at a job that drove me crazy.  I stopped working after I had my child and felt a relief you can't imagine.  As my son got older, I felt it time to hit the workforce again - but was none the wiser about what to do.  A friend suggested this book and I have to say - I am amazed at what this book has done for me.  While the process is long - you have to work through many exercises - the end result is a better knowledge of yourself, your interests and skills.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who isn't sure what career path to choose, anyone who is unhappy in their current job, or people just looking for a positive change in their lives.<br /><br />I didn't give this 5 stars as I periodically felt the exercises took too much time and I just wanted to \\"get the answer\\".  Patience isn't really my strong suit and there is alot of work involved.  Having said that - the end result is worth the effort!	2004-10-30

Well - this book does answer one question - what do rich people do with all their photos?  They publish a book!<br /><br />For the fans of Paris Hilton (perhaps her family, maybe some teenage girls, etc.) this is probably a must-have.  Here, in one shiny book, are hundreds of pictures of Paris.  Different clothes, different poses, pics with pooch - you name it!  In between the pics are snip-its of \\"Paris Wisdom\\" such as fashion dos and don'ts, the Paris diet, make-up tips, etc.  And, if you are a big fan of the color pink - you'll be happy to know that it is used liberally throughout!<br /><br />I shouldn't be too harsh - afterall, my friend's daughter thinks Paris rules and uses her book like a bible (scary thought - huh!).

I found this book to be a great introduction to theories on the origins of our universe, the concepts of time, gravity, the big-bang, black holes, wormholes, etc.  This is not an in-depth textbook full of incomprehensible language and ideas, but more a guide that provides the reader with a glimpse into the various theories used to explain the physics of the universe for the past 2000 years or so.  While there are quite a few technical terms and some of the discussion is confusing, most readers will walk away knowing more than they knew before reading the book.  We're also left with the realization that this is an ever-changing field - new research and theories are constantly coming into play and many ideas and concepts are still complete mysteries.<br /><br />A Brief History of Time was not written for experts in the areas of physics/astrophysics (you already know all this), but more for the educated reader that wants to know a little more about some very interesting concepts.  Don't be surprised if you find one or more areas that have piqued your interest to do further research!	2004-10-13

This series of books by \\"Lemony Snicket\\" does not have the standard \\"happy ending\\" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their \\"uncle\\" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.<br /><br />Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many \\"large\\" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!<br /><br />The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super.	2004-10-10

I highly recommend this book to readers of the previous ten books!  While this book is longer than the others (and has some slow areas), the story is full of surprises - interesting locations, dreadful happenings, etc.<br /><br />Count Olaf and his evil minions are still after the Baudelaire children, but Olaf has definitely changed.  He doesn't seem nearly as evil as he was in past and he now has the most awful laugh which just about drove me crazy (perhaps this was intended???).  There are also changes in the Baudelaires - the children are growing up.  Sunny is no longer a baby and has become a very interesting character.  The older sibs have more issues to face, including conflicts with each other.  We receive more clues about VFD and characters from previous books show up - and not everyone is quite as they have appeared in past.<br /><br />I found more to laugh about in this book and the ending is probably the best so far.  Don't get me wrong - there are still so many miserable, horrible, mysterious things - we will have to read the next two books to (hopefully) get all our questions answered.  I, for one, can't wait!<br /><br />A note to those who haven't already read books 1 - 10.  If possible, try to read all the books in order prior to reading this book.  Each book builds on the previous one and so many references are made to past books, you won't understand the story very well - heck, it is hard enough for those who have read them in order to follow, because there is so much time in between books!<br /><br />Also, this is not a \\"happy ending\\" series of books.  While I think they are fantastic and my son loves them, I urge parents to read the books first before deciding if they are appropriate for their younger readers.	2004-10-09

Dr. Phil has written a book to help parents in their never ending quest to create happy, well behaved children.  While his suggestions are somewhat thin, he says that the basics of parenting are still what is important, and concern about the various problems of our world shouldn't make us lose that focus.<br /><br />He stresses that parents should make decisions as a unit and shows the problems that occur when they don't.  He goes over some basic ways to discipline and how to keep the lines of communication open - another area that lacks detail.<br /><br />This isn't a perfect book, but Dr. Phil provides a good, no nonsense approach to parenting that gives you a place to start  If you like Dr. Phil - you'll probably like the book.  If you don't like his simplistic style, this book isn't going to provide enough detail for you.	2004-10-03

Written in a faux textbook format, this book is both entertaining and informative.  Using fabulous comic satire, noone from the first President to our current President is left untouched.

I strongly recommend reading this book if you are the parent/educator of a gifted child.  This book is a real eye opener into school life of American gifted children - even those that seem to be doing just fine.  My son is highly gifted and absolutely loves school.  He had a wonderful teacher in third grade and likes his 4th grade teacher even better.  He scores 100 on most tests and generally seems happy.  So - what's the problem?  He's not learning anything!  Until I read this book, it never even occurred to me to ask my son if he has learned anything new this year.  He does homework daily, has tests and quizzes in all subjects - of course he's learning - right?  When I asked him yesterday if he thought he was actually learning - he said no - nothing new.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being new work that is challenging) he rated last year and this year a 4 (I think he would have rated it lower, but he could tell I was heading for a slight freak-out).<br /><br />Genius Denied points out that many bright children are just coasting in our school system.  They already know the work and \\"learning\\" the material comes effortlessly.  Even if they aren't having emotional difficulty with being forced to repeatedly learn things they already know, it can become a serious problem later on when they actually come across material they don't know.  Many won't even know how to study.<br /><br />I think the book gives great information about the different types of \\"gifted\\" classes offered by schools, especially in the elementary grades.  My son was in a math pullout last year and will probably be in it again this year.  The author questions how a 1-hour a week enrichment class is supposed to provide the learning enrichment these children need.  Heck - I never even questioned that as I thought it was so awesome our school even offered enrichment programs.<br /><br />I am not criticizing the American school system - I am sure the teachers and administration want the best for all the kids in the US and the system is working hard to make sure every child learns the basics.  However, this book clearly shows how the school system fails gifted children.  Incredible quantities of money are spent on special education programs, IEPs, etc., to help children with learning problems reach their maximum potential.  But few states have any sort of funding or mandated programs to help bright children reach theirs.  This is a huge loss to our country at a time we really need all the knowledge and talent our youth can muster to keep up with our increasingly technological world.<br /><br />The book also provides loads of suggestions on how to work with your child's school, participate in outside classes and alternative learning environments, etc.  After you read it, make sure to pass it on to your child's teacher and then the principal.

You really like this worm, his friends and family - even his vain sister.  My son loves the illustrations and pours over each page each time he reads it.  As bizarre as it seems, every child seems fascinated by worms - and this book helps you understand why!  Prepare to smile!	2003-12-07

The illustrations are so vivid and endearing!  The story is all about a helpful little boy that tries to please a mouse that wants to eat a cookie.  This leads to one thing after another (moms will totally understand this concept) and by the end of the book, the little boy is so exhausted helping the mouse he's ready to collapse.  I loved this book as much as my son did and we read this off and on for several years - a perfect snuggle up book before bed!	2003-12-07

This series of books by \\"Lemony Snicket\\" does not have the standard \\"happy ending\\" of most childrens books.  The 3 kids in these stories have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another.  Because of this, I thought my 7 year old son wouldn't like them - wrong!  He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter!  The writing is dry, but funny.  The books contain many \\"large\\" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text.  I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 12 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats).  As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!	2002-11-28
