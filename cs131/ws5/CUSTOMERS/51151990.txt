Douglas and Oldshaker have written so many non-fiction books, and this work of fiction is wonderfully done - The idea of putting together a group of folks that are considered washed up to investigate situations is reminiscent of the A-Team - just as fun, and as cool.<br /><br />This book has a sequel that was not the caliber of Wings, but one still hopes for another outing of our Wings cast -<br /><br />Please, Mr. Douglas???	2005-10-12

The idea of this book was fascinating and does bring back intensity of the 'Silence of the Lambs' interaction - and it is as effective in this wonderful read.<br />Wilson Velez is a prisoner who formed an ultra-violent gang who is in a high security prison and has a given a new court review to moderate his life at the prison - Lisbeth was a popular serial writer, whose subject has gotten worn, and failing sales - She decides to interview Wilson and maybe get herself writing again.<br />The 'dance' between writer Lisbeth and Wilson is mesmerizing - and soon you get so caught up you wonder who is really telling the true story - who is the manipulator - is Wilson a visionary or is he still the ultra-violent gang leader still operating in this high security prison?<br />The ending and its events that proceed it are thought provoking and will haunt you after you close the book.<br />Well worth the hardback price.	2005-10-12

The team Preston-Child is one of the most wondrous writers of today. Individually, they outshine themselves! The Codex is a treasure - literally and figuratively - three + brothers on a wild ride to find their father's inheritance in the Honduras. It spawned an excellent sequel, Tyrannosaur Canyon, but Codex is amazing - non-stop action as the Broadbents find what treasure really is -<br /><br />One of the most wonderful 'characters' is Hairy Bugger - he features prominently in the plot and readers will really loved Bugger's part.<br /><br />Mr. Preston, keep 'em coming - Fans of good reads - this ranks high up the list.<br /><br />Should have been a 5 star review, but my finger must have slipped!!! 5 stars folks!	2005-10-08

Tyrannosaur Canyon is a combination of Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, and James Bond - like The Codex. Canyon is a sequel to The Codex with Tom Broadbent as the hero and leaves the characters open for yet another sequel. I think I like Codex better, because instead of character like Hairy Bugger, there is only a T-Rex in Tyrannosaur...<br />A great read and thoroughly enjoyable!<br />Worth the hardback price!	2005-09-11

Angels in the Gloom continues the saga of the Reavley family and the deaths of their parents, the mystery of a treaty that could have changed the course of history, and graphic scenes of WWI front lines. This book centers on Joseph Reavley, a chaplain, who is wounded and is sent home to recover. We see the homelife in WWI England, and the horror of attacks in London. Mrs. Perry is an expert in the history of the Victorian Era and the era of WWI. Everything is succinct and not a word frivolously wasted.<br /><br />This new series is as satisfying as her other works.<br /><br />Makes me think of Wilfred Owens' poetry about England at war -<br /><br />touches the heart and puts you in the trenches with the poor soldiers and the staff.<br /><br />One hopes Mrs. Perry doesn't forget Monk and Pitt series - while developing this excellent series.	2005-09-04

But only bad guys like pedophiles, those feeding on the innocent. He channels his desires to make the world a safer place. This time the plot does not include further adventures of Dexter and his brother, but helping his foster sister Deb, go after another nasty.<br /><br />While this premise is not the surprise the debut book held, we are chuckling what Dexter gets himself in - like getting engaged in a suprisingly amusing course of events. But it gets better when he learns some 'good news' about his potential step-children.<br /><br />All in all a good read. Keep 'em coming Jeff Lindsay!	2005-08-24

True, this book features so many from the Pendergast series and they are all great - but the struggle between the Pendergast brothers just doesn't click for me. Normally when Pendergast is on the page, things sizzle and pages turn quickly. With this one - I feel like ok, happen already!<br />They keep saying the deep secret about the brothers - well, in the previous novels, Pendergast has said the brothers agreed not to marry and have children thus ending the inherited madness of the family - you think that ticked little bro off just a little? But with the hatred of the two, does it seem logical they'd have this birds and bees topic??<br />Will be looking forward to the next outing, but please get back to tighter writing, and more action.<br />As stated in the title sentence above, Pendergast in a lesser book is still better than no Pendergast book.	2005-07-14

A new face has been added to the list of must read authors - Ms. Victoria Laurie. Better Read Than Dead is the 2nd book featuring Abby Cooper, a gifted intuitive in Michigan, and her friends and loved ones. Where the 1st book really introduces Abby and her friends to us, this book pulls out the stops and lets us see the world of the paranormal. There is a favor a friend calls in to read fortunes with Tarot cards at a Greek wedding reception that lands Abby in some hot water indeed. The plot is believable as she deals with the unsavory consequences of having read a hit man's cards at the reception. This brings her to the attention of a Greek gangster, who wants Abby to advise him about his 'business' and subsequent heirs.<br />Having lived in Detroit and suburbs of Detroit, I can remember Greektown and working at RenCen. Ms. Laurie is hitting her stride, very comfortable in Abby's skin and effortlessly gets us involved in her life and friendships of Dutch, her hunky FBI boyfriend, and their friend Milo, a great cop, her sister Cat, her handy man Dave, and her sweet pooch, Eggy.<br />This book gives insight to the world of the psychic and their responsibility of their readings - what if someone not skilled read fortunes and completely misinterprets what is before her like Cat did? or visions were read another way than intended? It is a great responsibility that professional psychics face, and Abby is a great example of that - dealing with her Crew - her guides etc who help her from the Other Side.<br />Ms. Laurie is a delightful writer and gifted psychic herself, causing this reader to see her website and get a reading - she was excellent and a super person. Highly recommend you try too. If you are a fan of Abby Cooper's, you are interested in the paranormal. Follow your guides and read Abby's adventures and see how special this series and their writer truly is.	2005-06-11

Can't help it - vampires have an allure - am not the only one - Sookie Stackhouse is the heroine that can drive the hunkiest vampire crazy out there. She is a telepath, and sometimes it gets her misunderstood as a kook, but she's a sweetie. The series is a not so gory vampire tale with vampires being integrated into the main stream human life. They drink synthetic blood the Japanese invented. In the previous books, the violence had been at a minimum, if you don't count vampires biting while making love, but this book has a few moments that hit you - being a werewolf trying to be head hocho of their clan is a killer...literally.<br />There is a character that has endeared us to him - Bubba - He is a vampire whose transition to vampire went awry - he isn't all there and loves cat blood...but he can sing great!!! He used to be a famous singer out of Memphis that people have been spotting at the Burger King!!! What a great addition to the cast of characters!! We know who Bubba was, but don't say his REAL name!<br />Ms. Harris is a wonderful writer and continues Sookie's adventures into the paranormal with ease and makes them real.<br />Who wouldn't want to have a fling with Eric???<br />Parting comments - buy the whole series if you haven't done so yet, or keep enjoying Sookie and friends with her fans.	2005-05-23

For some reason, although I follow approximately 50 authors, I had not read Brian Haig's work. Well, I corrected that after reading this book, I ordered all his previous works. No wonder I keep Amazon in business!<br /><br />The reason this book captivated me is not only because of the nonstop action (although it was easy to figure 'who dunit'), is Haig's writing style is smooth and writes like Nelson DeMille, which ain't bad...<br /><br />I will have to add Haig to my list.

This reviewer is not one who like a child in class tells you the plot of a novel - you are mature enough to read the plot line when you are contemplating the book to buy.<br />What I want to tell you is why you should choose this book, or any Greg Iles books.<br />He not only chooses diverse subjects for each books, but almost all of his books have a lyric quality in his writing, that makes layers upon layers as you read - there is beauty in his style that is magic. I can quote passages from his earlier works, and not many can say they do that with other authors. I sent a 'fan letter' to Iles and he was gracious and I was impressed.<br />I call him our generation's Faulkner, because he not only knows the South, but knows how to portray it not in black and white, but how it weaves its spell into the plot of the novel.<br />If you have not read Mortal Fear and The Quiet Game, they are definite must haves. The others are excellent, but have varying impact on the reader. Blood Memory stands out among his excellent works - and is worth the wait we fans had to endure.<br />Usually his works come out in September, and we had some time to wait this time, but it is worth it.<br />This is a man who has a gift. Read the plot above, or others' reviews that read like a book review in school, although the book's subject is serious. What I am here to tell you is WHY to buy a book. It hits you on many levels and makes you think as well as experience. And that makes the difference between a good writer and a great one.	2005-02-20

This is a PREQUEL TO DAVINCI CODE	Some have gotten confused that DaVinci Code came before Angels and Demons. Not so - we meet Langdon in this formidable novel that is a delight to read, a great 'who done it' and masterfully handled. I took this book to a seminar to read after hours and when I looked and saw I only had 20 pages left, I literally screamed in dismay - The real star of Angels and Demons is the character Carmelengo Carlo Ventresca, the interim person in charge of the Vatican after the death of his mentor the Pope, and before the Cardinals vote on the next Pope. He is one of those unforgettable characters that comes once in a long while - The Vatican and Bernini sculptures are also major characters in this book - utterly fascinating how it was all pieced together.<br />If you have not read A&D & Code, go for it - they are both delightful, keep you on a rollercoaster that you don't want to get off. But my favoite is Angels and Demons.<br />Dan Brown don't go back to your first novels, strictly about coding - add a wonderful adventure and superb characters, and you have magic.	2005-01-29

With great relief to report that Carol O'Connell's latest novel, Winter House, has the top form we have come to expect from her. While the story deals with a mass murder 50+ years ago, one of the siblings disappeared at that time, and the fascination of the book is the respective relationships Mallory and Charles Butler to Neddy (Red) Wright. Charles is charmed by her, but the subtle interest is Mallory's interaction with the woman who disappeared when she was a child. This is close to Mallory's story-being an enigmatic street child, saved by Louis Markowitz, a cop, who brings the child home, and Helen, his wife who decided Mallory was a birthday present. Mallory grows up to be a cop herself. All characters who were featured in previous books that helped raise and love Mallory are included in this book. There is also a hint of magic or occult as Mallory is guided by an old radio playing music of Red's era.<br />Well written, crisp, it is a must read. O'Connell has evolved into a snappy writer, and in her last 2 novels, has set the bar very high...keep it going, please!!	2004-11-02

Thia is not a Harry Potter magic kind of book - it casts you into a world of the magical unknown.<br />This is the story of two magicians, and when you dabble where you should not go, you pay the price.

You all have read the story line from editors and other reviewers, so will tell you this is by far the best of the Pendergast books. I was saddened to see the last page before me.<br /><br />It brings back old friends from previous books, and shows more insight to our dapper agent. He speaks of his brother, and the warning he has received from him. It shows a surprisingly sensual side as Pendergast meets the Countess at her villa - like love at first sight...it shows his bravery and the mystery of his mental and physical strength he has learned from his Eastern teachers.<br /><br />I hope Child and Preston are working hard on this book's sequel.<br /><br />Don't know how they'll top this one.	2004-08-13

The story holds up and it is a thrilling ride that encompasses different eras and chess and romance. It has quite a 'cult' following even now.<br />If you have not read The Eight - it is a must read - and reread -  and we will keep our fingers crossed that Ms. Neville finally writes another  timeless book!!!!<br />The Eight is a classic and I recommend it more than words can say.<br />PS - Ms. Neville has written a SEQUEL - The Fire\\" A Movel - after 20 years!<br />I will be re-reviewing this as I am rereading The Eight in anticipation of the sequel - as I start to read, I remember why it has remained one of my favorite books -	2003-09-23

This is ellen in Atlanta - There are some debut novels that make you want for more before the end of the first novel, and Quantico Rules is one of those - The writing style is fluid and the character development is smooth - deals with old ways vs new ways - from good old J. Edgar Hoover's reign to present day and the stragglers from his regime - and the good folks who want justice like our hero Monk - This book reminds me of Les Roberts' character Milan Jankovich and that is truly a great complement - Start writing soon Mr. Riehl - if I could preorder the sequel now, I would - that's how good this baby is -	2003-09-18

This is ellen in atlanta and have stayed with the Mallory series through thick and thin - and can only tell you that this book is the BEST of the series and if Carol backpedals to mediocrity, I'll do something Mallory-like and tear up the book - yeah, right...<br />This book focuses on Riker, Mallory's partner, and as close to a friend as the impaired Mallory can get - Enter a hunchback, a beautiful and sensitive person on Riker's brother's crime cleaning service who is not who she seems - It is riviting and touching and I am proud of the jump in writing that occured in this book.<br />Am also glad that the book lessens on Charles' unrequited love for Mallory - he is a wonderful character and deserves a love interest who will be worthy - maybe shaking Mallory into seeing what she's missing??? yeah, right.<br />For Mallory fans, a must read book. For novices, a good time to jump in and connect. For series, I generally suggest to buy back issues and 'catch up', but in the case of O'Connell, use your judgement -<br />But the ending is worth the price of the book. And more's the pity that Mallory doesn't get the gravestone's message.	2003-09-18

But that didn't stop me from enjoying this book and wanting more - If you are a believer of ESP or are open to possibilities that there is more than our 'normal' senses give us, then this book is for you, because it blends a good thriller with the psychic world.

This is ellen in atlanta, and although I wrote a review of  Footprints of God, I felt I didn't do it justice - I tried to compare this book to his others - specifically The Quiet Game, which is my favorite of his works - in that he was to me the next Faulkner - and I frequently quote the beginning words of Chapter 25 which blows me away - This book, Footprints of God, and his other works, is so completely different from each, that to compare would be a gross misunderstanding of what Iles is writing - he's evolving as he writes - each work a wildly different subject that jolts you into a reality you didn't think you could be lifted to - The Footprints of God deals with the creation of a super, living computer that is frighteningly close to the artificial intelligence countries are working toward. There is an ethicist who in the process of mega MRI's has visions of himself as Jesus, and can lend the meaning of what is out there to meld man and machine - The book is phenomenal - It is not lyrical like Quiet Game. It is computer lightening quick and a wonderful book not to be missed - Iles might be our next Faulkner, only evolved...a must read.	2003-08-18

This is ellen in Atlanta, and can think of no better read than the world of Plum! This book is a perfect blend of sex, humor, adventure, mystery, etc. Moreso than the other 8 books. The side trip to Vegas was an added treat - This book also blends the perfect combination of sexy hunk Joe Morelli and the steamy Ranger - tag teaming to take care of Stephanie - Although the murderer is suspected early on, what a ride to the last page - Only wish Grandma Mazur was featured more - her visits to Stiva's Funeral Home are legendary and any page with her and you have to dry your eyes from the tears of laughter -<br />Ms. Evanovich continues to impress with her wit and perfecting Stephanie's life and adventures - Love the Yellow Escape! My brother drives one and it is a fun car and perfect for her adventures, but I have a vision of an explosion coming on - Stephanie isn't too good with cars, although with this book, Ranger's (oooh Ranger) merry men get the brunt of the damage -<br />If there are some and I cannot see many - who haven't read all of the Stephanie Plum books, go back and enjoy them from One for the Money on to this wonderful book - This is the best!

Harry is in the midst of teenage years and it seems constant PMS - One of the charms of the other books has been the chemistry between HP and Dumbledore, and Hagrid, and others - Yes, a major character dies, and that is a turning point - this book answers many of the questions we have asked ourselves - from why Harry has to stay at the Dursley's to what is truly going on in regard to the 'legend' of the return of Voldemort and the battle to defeat the evil forces - it is fascinating and worth wading thru the angst and angst and angst...<br />For charm, go back to HP and the Prisoner of Azkaban - for answers to your questions, read this one -	2003-06-22

Gregory is a psychologist in Boulder Co. with a wife who is an Asst.

Very timely - dealing with implications of right and wrong and who determines justice and who dispenses that justice. Gregory deals with burn out of his practice, and what is the level of confidentiality when lives are at stake and his patient/dr. confidentiality tears him up on many levels.<br />White makes Gregory more human and it is a step in the right direction -<br />Yiassou Stephen White!

A definite read - just have a little more patience - this is no From the Corner of His Eye, but to me that is the tops he's done in a long time.<br />(where is the guy who can only get around in the dark?)what happened to those novels?

The eight Stephanie Plum book disappoints on so many levels it hurts - the anticipation of the Ranger-Stephanie going to bed to pay off the debt from the 7th book was a bummer - didn't happen then, but when it did in this book, it wasn't even sensual. We all enjoy a trip to Stivic's Funeral Home with Grandma Mazur, and all we got was a small review of Grandma looking under some poor guys' eyes to see what a nice job Stivic did on him. Stephanie's mother had decided to go to nursing school - no word on her finally getting on her feet. The estrangement with Morelli and Stephanie has no where else to go.<br />I agree with a lot of folks that it is time to get Janet to write am outline with feedback from her fans and time to make changes and get the zip back - don't get me wrong - a lesser Stephanie Plum book is better than other's better efforts in a heartbeat - but we have seen better, funnier and sexier and really miss that! Maybe Janet can call Patricia Cornwell and talk to her about Kay Scarpetta...	2002-06-28

Elizabeth Peters has developed the familiar as our own family characters in this 14th outing of the Emersons and their kith and kin in Egypt in 1917. The plot is typical Peters - tombs to find, killers to capture, espionage adventures that showcase the son, Ramses for the true hero he is - But what has impressed me in the entire series is the character developement - from the 1st book Crocodile on the Sandbank, which brings Amelia in contact with the vibrant Emerson, to the birth of their son, Walter (Ramses), to the introduction of the beautiful Nefret in one of the best of the series, The Last Camel Died at Noon, we see the family and their servants and workers and what they mean to their lives - Their reis, Abdullah, is a strong presence that is felt even now - The best thing about this progression is we finally get to see what each character means to each other, and that is wonderful.<br />Yes, there are great adventures, yes, there are recurring villians, and new villians to come, but the fun of these novels makes you feel you are in that time and in that place and enjoying every second of it.<br />For those of you thinking of buying The Golden One, I suggest you start with the 1st and work your way up - You'll be delighted you did.	2002-04-07

We wait with anticipation for each book and Dead Sleep won't disappoint Greg Iles fans. When photojournalist Jordan Glass see her 'glass' likeness in an art collection of nude ladies purported to be not sleeping, but dead, she goes on a treck to find an answer to the mystery of her twin sister's disappearance, and the disappearance of others in the New Orleans area. The story has all the elements of a masterful thriller, but what is lacking is the lyrical quality that has been present in Iles' previous books. Look up the ist paragraph chapter 25 of Quiet Game - those words touch the heart and take you upward. Dead Sleep keeps you in the here and now and solidly, not lyrically, takes you through a wonderfully plotted book. Not his best, but Greg Iles ranks tops out there.	2001-07-31
