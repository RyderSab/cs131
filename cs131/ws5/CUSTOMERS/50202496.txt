US	50202496	RGKAFGADXKSRV	1567921582	371874655	W, or the Memory of Childhood (Verba Mundi) (Verba Mundi (Paperback))	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Still Amazing, After All These Years...	It's about time this book was reissued in English, in a fine translation by Perec's standard-bearer in the Anglophone world. Perec's half-fictive and half-autobiographical masterpiece is an original and devastating approach to one of the most difficult historical moments of the recent past, the Holocaust. &quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; embodies all of the violence of this historical tragedy and of memories of such tragedy.<br />There are two narrative threads running through this book, touching each other occasionally in a manner that illuminates both in strange and arresting ways. Half of the chapters are &quot;W,&quot; the fictional account of a man, Gaspard Winckler, who has survived a war by adopting the identity of a parapalegic (the real Gaspard Winckler) who later dies in a shipwreck off the Tierra del Fuego. Prodded by the mysterious Otto Apfelstahl, the living Gaspard embarks on a journey to recover his memory of the real Gaspard, to discover who he was and how he died. This journey becomes, in the second half of &quot;W,&quot; a description in coldly anthropological terms of a seemingly totalitarian island-state, in which citizens are forced to compete in brutal and naked athletic games for things like food and the right to procreate--the basics of human life.<br />The other half of the chapters are Perec's own autobiographical contributions, beginning, despite the promising title of the book, with the admission, &quot;I have no memory of childhood.&quot; Perec's voice sifts through his rubbled past--his father's death in the French Army, his mother's transportation to Auschwitz, his being concealed in a Catholic school and raised by his relatives--and attempts to separate what he remembers from what he has been taught to remember through photos, language, etc. His reflections are marked with a humor that is endearing in light of his horrifying experiences, and with a subtlety that is astounding in light of the atrocities to which the text must bear remote witness.<br />The two narratives, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Childhood,&quot; weave around each other like ivy, finally becoming, in a stunning and climactic final chapter, part and parcel of one story. Perec's ultimate fusion of his willful fictions and his awe-full remembrances is powerful and well-presaged; the entire universe of the book builds beautifully and disturbingly toward this final moment, as the fictions become more like fact and the autobiography occupies itself increasingly with fictions.<br />Bellos' translation is superb, even if one does lose some of the very productive puns of the original (the moment early on, for example, when &quot;l'Histoire avec sa grande hache&quot; should make us think simultaneously of History with a capital H and History with its big axe; Bellos sticks with the capital H rendering of the phrase).  (From what I can tell, he has not modified his original translation of the book substantially, if at all.)<br />&quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; is a sobering, touching, daunting and disturbing reminder of some of the worst our century has had to offer. If you are interested in a writer who is unashamed of standing heroically baffled and gaping in the face of immeasurable atrocity, buy and read this book.	2003-07-23

He opts instead for the easier, less instructive path, though, and \\"Tenured Radicals\\" is a half-informed slinging of mud, very little of which sticks.<br />Bloom and Bennett passionately believed in the legacy they were defending, and their earnestness is evident; Kimball seems rather to relish the opportunity to sting the \\"elitist academic Left.\\"  Castigating institutional figures like Houston Baker for resorting to name-calling rather than real engagement, Kimball himself is guilty of the most unpardonable of rhetorical sins.  Unable, via logical argumentation, to truly invalidate the loathed theories, chapters often fade into dismissive sarcasm or rude ad hominems: Louis Althusser's theories can't be right because he later went insane, Kimball argues, and Rosalind Krauss can't be right because she lives in a nicely decorated apartment.<br />Kimball's prize piece is his rebuke of academics who held to Paul de Man even after it was revealed, in 1987, that de Man had written for a Nazi-friendly Belgian paper during WWII.  Much should be made of this crisis, which still plagues academics to this day: When do the younger crimes of a man (or ought we to call them \\"youthful indiscretions\\"?) overshadow all the good he does later in his life?  Kimball is spot on to point out the waffling of Derrida, Hartmann, and others in this regard.  But he is wrong to claim that this invalidates everything they stand for.  This would be like judging conservatism solely on the example of Watergate.<br />But then, Kimball is not interested in fairness, clearly.  His prime example of post-structuralist close reading?  Geoffrey Hartmann, who had practically an entire book written about how careless a critic he can be (Norris' \\"Deconstruction: Theory & Practice\\").  Here, too, Kimball is myopic, since he depicts the academy as an unthinking mass when, in reality, it is a site of constant debate and struggle; post-structuralism ran/runs rampant, yes, but that never means that everyone accepts it uncritically.  \\"Tenured Radicals\\" doesn't bother to address the debates.<br />And so, Kimball's final image of Socrates' trial is both laughable and disingenuous.  \\"Tenured Radicals\\" would have us believe that Kimball speaks, like Socrates, for eternal and unquestionable truths.  The fog-thick irony in this moment was clearly lost on Kimball, so I'll help him to understand it.  See, people of Kimball's ilk--that is, those who pretend to speak for \\"culture\\" or for \\"decency\\" everywhere, and who will not countenance their being questioned to any degree--are precisely the Athenians who found Socrates guilty of corrupting the youth of his city and exiled him.  Kimball may not believe in the aims of today's \\"tenured radicals.\\"  But he owed them, in the spirit of Socrates at least, a fairer and less blindly partisan assessment.<br />Readers would do well to avoid Kimball.  Read Bloom, and Gerald Graff's \\"Beyond the Culture Wars\\" if you really want to see a civil, earnest, and informed debate between a traditionalist and a \\"tenured radical.\\"	2002-12-12

Bush and the Making of an American President	Books	4	19	22	N	N	A Fair, Thorough View of the Life of President Bush	Don't believe the packaging of this reprint: Hatfield and his editors have billed this as a broadside against George W. Bush, but it is not.  Rather, it is a meticulous, careful report of who George W. Bush is and how he came by a position to run for (and eventually win) the office of President of the United States.<br />For the first 100 pages of this book, I was astonished that the Bushies had wanted it banned in the first place.  I did NOT have a high opinion of President Bush as a person when I first picked this book up, but, after reading about his childhood--his father often away working in oil fields, the death of his little sister when Bush was 7--I actually found myself moved and feeling for him.  He was a sensitive soul, his mother says, whose smirk and joking manner came as an emotional defense at the loss of his beloved sister.  This is a side of Bush I had never seen.<br />This changes, though, when he, like other adolescents, begins to make mistakes, and \\"Fortunate Son\\" charts these mistakes as they gather steam and begin to impact other people in a disturbing way.  The reader cannot blame Dubya for his ancestors' business ties to Hitler (up to 1943) or for his being born into a privileged economic position.  Less easily dismissed are his rounds of philandering and alcoholism and his absolute educational waste of his Yale years (unless you count his making innumerable money contacts), all of which are narrated by FRIENDS of his!  The political life that follows is even more informative and troubling; Dubya's no-holds-barred, look-the-other-way campaigning fails at first but quickly gets him elected Governor of Texas.<br />To the credit of both the late Hatfield and this book, the tone of the prose is alarmingly neutral.  (The preface and introduction by Hatfield's editors at Soft Skull are NOT neutral, however.)  This was, for me, the most shocking thing, as I'd expected a nasty, partisan critique of President Bush.  Hatfield is terribly kind to Dubyaearly on, and if later the book seems less kind, it is no acerbic storytelling voice that makes Dubya look like a not-so-nice guy; it is, instead, Bush's own actions.<br />The reviewers who have been angered by the inclusion, in this book, of allegations about Bush's arrest and community service cover-up, National Guard prioritization, insider-trading, etc., have not read the book.  Hatfield is careful to discuss these as allegations, and in fact I was LESS convinced that there had been wrongdoing as re: Bush's Vietnam-era military dodge than I had been before.  It must also be remembered that Hatfield originally wrote this for a HUGE New York publisher, and that facts were vetted by a phalanx of lawyers before it went to press and was then pulled.<br />And, at any rate, disputing Hatfield's allegations misses the point.  There is enough public-record material in here to make us severely dubious of President Bush's record and sad that such a perennial underachiever has been ushered into the highest office in the land.  \\"Fortunate Son\\" is all the more useful as a story of tragic compromise, because it tells a story of a once-sensitive soul whose smirk seems to have won out.	2002-12-01

What starts off as an annoying, arrogant read quickly turns into the sort of real-life account that leaves you saying, \\"No way...\\"  Abagnale conned his way into a pilot's uniform, a law practice, hospital rounds, and 6 months in a French prison, and he'll take you with him if you let him.<br />My roommate recommended this to me for fun, but warned me that she had quit reading it after the first 20 pages.  I almost didn't even get that far.  Abagnale's narrative voice is one of the most immediately annoying I've ever read; he comes across in the initial chapters as a chauvinistic (women are \\"delicious foxes\\"--did ANYBODY ever sound so dull?), arrogant, self-pitying (despite his wavering between denials and awareness of this) jerk from a bored suburban home.<br />Keep reading, though, and you won't be disappointed.  What starts off as tentative bad-check-floating quickly becomes full-blown international larceny.  More amusing, though, and more disturbing, are the ends to which Abagnale's capers force him.  By the end of the story, feeling the heat, he abandons his pilot scam and ends up faking a Harvard Law degree and practicing law, and the pace picks up so quickly at this point that the last chapters rush by.  Abagnale ends up in jail in France, and then in Sweden (and, apparently, there was a whole line-up of countries wanting to try him!), but the book's not over there; he's way too resourceful a con-artist to go quietly, and his post-arrest movements are even more exciting than anything before.<br />It's a fast-paced, fun read.  The prose is at times appallingly bad, with metaphors that are both overdone and mixed (\\"I wanted to be one of the bulls in this Georgia peach orchard\\"), and, as Abagnale goes on and on about how much he likes women and how often he likes them, you'll start to see in him the high-school kid who talks such big talk because he never walks the walk and thinks you won't like him unless he does.  This book could have been punchier and better (and about 100 pages shorter) without those digressions.<br />Still, by and large, I'd recommend it.  I couldn't put it down for the last 150 pages, as it moves quickly and crazily, and Abagnale and his co-writer are careful to up the ante as the story progresses.  All of which makes for a satisfying light read.	2002-12-01
US	50202496	R2178693EUQTBH	0425184226	243303903	The Sum of All Fears (A Jack Ryan Novel)	Books	3	6	7	N	N	A decent read, but by far not Clancy's best	I've enjoyed everything I've read by Clancy, and \\"The Sum of All Fears\\" was no exception.  Despite its narrative sprawl and occasional lack of focus, it is good Clancy: a well-paced plot with a long dramatic peak that lasts about 100 pages and ushers in a fairly satisfying ending.<br />We know the basic plot: missing weapons-grade nuclear material gets made into a huge, multi-stage bomb by German and Middle Eastern terrorists.  It is taken stateside, and Jack Ryan and his government buddies must overcome bureaucracy and their own disagreements in order to keep this act of terrorism from throwing the world into total chaos.<br />At its best moments, \\"The Sum of All Fears\\" exhibits Clancy's trademark rapid-fire shift of scene; I can think of few authors who can orchestrate, as well as Clancy does, the sort of globally organized tension that caps off this novel.  From submarines in the Pacific to hotel rooms in Denver, from the Pentagon to the Middle East, Clancy pushes the plot forward surely, vignette by vignette, in a manner that usually manages to keep from feeling choppy or disjointed.  This strategy helps to create HUGE tension, as the scene flits from back-room to front line and registers the immediate reaction and counter-reactions of all involved.<br />\\"The Sum of All Fears\\" was also prescient in imagining the possibility of a major terrorist attack on American soil.  9/11 proves Clancy's imagination terrifyingly adept.  And although his novel delivers the requisite demonized evil-doers, the Native American terrorist Marvin Russell is painted surprisingly sympathetically, giving fuller and more shockingly human shape to the horrible act in which he unwittingly participates toward the novel's end.<br />My reservations about the novel are few but important.  First, there are meanderings, especially the annoying football conversations, which are neither illustrative nor interesting.  Their dialog is stilted, as if Clancy himself is forcing the subject, and this is only partially redeemed when the sport of football becomes, by novel's end, peripherally related to the plot.  Like the detailed technical profiles of military hardware that one has come to expect from Clancy, the football arguments halt the movement of the story.  But at least the technical details are interesting.<br />Then there's the opening premise--the adoption of Civil Rights-era peaceful resistance by Palestinians--which is a real whale of a hypothesis (no less an authority than Jack Ryan claims \\"the Arabs have figured out how to destroy Israel\\" [62]).  After this imaginative 100-page introduction, though, Clancy more or less drops the entire idea; it disappears completely, and I could almost hear him saying, \\"Wait, I can't do that--who wants to read a novel about peace?!?!\\"  Left in at the beginning, it sticks out like a spare part and a crass simplification of the Israel/Palestine conflict.<br />Despite my problems with \\"The Sum of All Fears,\\" though, it was a fairly enjoyable read, and the pay-off at the end was good, since Clancy builds tension masterfully.  But it's by far not his best work.  \\"Patriot Games,\\" for example, is tighter and better written; if you're looking to read your first Clancy, I'd start there.	2002-11-05
US	50202496	R10TV4AEZSINED	0061076082	786721892	Dream Brother: The Lives and Music of Jeff and Tim Buckley	Books	4	44	45	N	N	Two stories that work unbelievably well as one...	As a huge fan of Jeff Buckley and a fan of Tim, I approached David Browne's \\"Dream Brother\\" with a real wariness.  After all, hadn't Jeff always protested people's inability to keep him and his father separate?  Couldn't someone have told his story on its own merits?  Browne, too, repeatedly acknowledges Jeff's open antipathy toward the penumbra of his father's career.  This biography of both artists, though, while sympathetic and fair in its treatment of father and son, is convincing evidence that reading the lives of the Buckleys together sheds better light on both; Browne gives fair airing to their trouble as true artists in a market-driven field, their rise from near-crippling early financial woes, and their tragic, early ends.<br />\\"Dream Brother\\" manages to avoid many of the clichés of musical biography that can grate on a reader.  Browne refrains from self-indulgent descriptions of the music itself (which NEVER translates well into words), keeps from canonizing his subjects while yet emphasizing their contribution and originality, and fairly measures their accomplishments--huge ones, in this case.  All the same, when Browne finally states the obvious--that we'll never really know how much better Tim or Jeff could have gotten--the strain of his objectivity is palpable, and the book feels a lot like a dry, outside look.<br />The structure changes this feel for the better, though.  Jeff is certainly the main focus here, despite the manner in which Tim's career seems to overshadow the book's first chapters.  Excerpts from Jeff's journal, usually relating to his distant father, introduce every chapter in the book, the structure of which creates its own small miracle.  Browne could have been conventional, starting at the start, with Tim's story, and then dealing with Jeff's.  \\"Dream Brother\\"'s chapters, though, alternate between slices of Tim's life and periods of Jeff's, and this alternation often highlights both the distance and the biographical similarities between them: fantasies of stardom and uncompromising artistry blended with lack of focus and on-again/off-again desire to connect.  Browne structures the two stories so that they build together toward an earned emotional climax: the meeting between father and son mere months before Tim's death.  The next chapter must detail, in a prose that is no less caring for its economy and simplicity, Jeff's more recent death.<br />By the end of \\"Dream Brother,\\" grief piles itself on grief, but Browne makes it clear as well that both Buckleys were in resurgent mode at the time of their respective passings, having rediscovered, before the end, the artistic voices they had despaired of ever hearing again.  It becomes clear that, to all their loved ones and fans, the early deaths of Tim and Jeff were not simply loss doubled.  They were loss multiplied exponentially.  This book is a fitting and often sensitively crafted tribute.	2002-10-18
US	50202496	R2WO1QAIEPKI9Z	0140445382	756847149	The Loom of Time: A Selection of His Plays and Poems (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	22	22	N	N	Great Translation, Intro Materials, Poems and Play	The book's cover declares Kalidasa \\"the greatest poet and playwright in classical Sanskrit literature and one of the greatest in world literature.\\"  These are lofty claims, but you will definitely agree by the time you reach the book's end.  Substantial introductory material, historical clarity and Chandra Rajan's attentive translation make this collection of Kalidasa's poetry and one of his plays a great read.<br />The greatest strength of this book is its thoroughness.  Roughly one half of the pages comprise the introduction, the glossary of Sanskrit terms, and the meticulous footnotes to the texts translated.  Rajan is careful in her historiography of Kalidasa, who is a problematic figure in that it is impossible to date him with any great degree of accuracy (Rajan points out that scholars have placed him anywhere from 100 BC to 500 AD; she herself comes down on the earlier side, making the playwright/poet a rough contemporary of, say, Plautus and Terence).<br />This care is also evident in the lengthy Sanskrit glossary to terms left untranslated in the texts themselves.  At first, this tendency is frustrating; when you're cruising through a play or poem, you don't want to be skipping to the book's end to see what's being said.  But it also helps to preserve the integrity of the original.  Rajan points out polyvalences in the Sanskrit that would have been simply whitewashed in typical English translation.  And, miraculously, by the end of the poem/play, you've internalized the Sanskrit meanings and don't NEED the glossary anymore.<br />As for the poems and plays themselves, they're a revelation.  The translation feels a bit antique--like reading Milton, say, or even Shakespeare--but this is perfectly suited to Kalidasa's position in literature.  The epic sweep of \\"The Cloud Messenger\\" is matched only by the sophistication of the famous play, \\"The Recognition of Sakuntala,\\" which places Kalidasa alongside Shakespeare, in my mind.  While Plautus and Terence were scripting the comic format that, borrowed from Menander, would evolve into the worst of today's sit-coms, Kalidasa was writing comedy with such dark corners that it provokes as much thought as laughter.  If the seeming cheesiness of some of the lovey-dovey parts annoys today's reader, it must be admitted that it helps to accentuate the frustration of the darker parts.  The ending is happy, yes, as the King eventually realizes his mistake, comes out of his oblivion and takes his intended, Sakuntala, back; but before we reach that point, there are three or four acts replete with suffering and rejection, of an intensity that Western comedy would not countenance for over a thousand years.<br />This collection of Kalidasa makes for satisfying reading, whether you're into slogging through the weighty introductory materials for the full picture, or just interested in experiencing some of the best of Indian--or world, for that matter--poetry and drama.	2002-09-29

Sassen is interested in more specific aspects of globalization: its impact on migration (the huge theme of this book), its place-specificity, and its resultant dispersal of powers that used to belong solely to the nation-state. Her points are good, but you don't need this book to get them, since she's made them all elsewhere and ages ago; in brief, the occasional new insights are not worth it.<br />Sassen's biggest contribution to the theorization of globalization is her attention to the global city, which she posits as a site of the physical infrastructure that enables the more diffuse projections of the world market. In these cities (like New York, L.A., Tokyo, London, Rio, etc.), high-wage, white-collar workers brush against the low-wage, largely immigrant diasporae that keep the global city running; immigrants form blocs that see a certain degree of enfranchisement and force adjustments in transnational immigration law; and globalization marches on. It's interesting stuff, but it's not new. Sassen's own book on \\"The Global City\\" scoops these chapters. And that's pretty much true of the rest of the book.<br />The two chapters on gender and globalization are much more valuable (and more recent) here, as she starts in on what she calls \\"the unbundling of sovereignty,\\" the appropriation of political punch from nation-states and the relocation of it into the hands of NGOs and the global market. Unfortunately, while she opens up a great area of inquiry, she doesn't take it very far at all, \\"since the effort here was not to gain closure but to open up an analytic field.\\" As they stand, these chapters are frustratingly suggestive but ultimately not very thorough or useful. Hopefully she'll revisit the theme later.<br />The stylistic question is a thorny one; several reviewers have already blasted Sassen for the way she writes. She's certainly not the easiest read, and her incessant neologisms are annoying. (\\"Operationalizing\\"? Can we not say, \\"making operational\\"?) You can fault her for that. But you can't fault her for writing like a sociologist, and that is largely how she writes. It's dry, there are charts and facts and figures, but the prose is economical and fairly clear (fake words aside!).<br />By and large, though, this isn't a must-read. If you're really interested, check out her books, \\"The Global City\\" and \\"The Mobility of Labor and Capital.\\" They treat the same subjects, but in more useful detail.	2002-09-29

In \\"The Way of the World,\\" Moretti sets his sights on the European Bildungsroman.<br />Moretti's basic argument is that the Bildungsroman genre served, in its various national incarnations, both to reveal and modify the processes of socialization--of putting each member of society into his or her proper place within the society--specific to each culture represented.  He begins with an innovative reading of Napoleon at Waterloo and its innumerable literary reproductions throughout the 19th century, arguing that societies embroiled in Napoleonic Republicanism developed radically different styles of envisioning the individual's position vis-&agrave;-vis society than were evident in the societies Napoleon didn't reach (namely England, whose Bildungsroman Moretti finds unpalatably reactionary, \\"far more elementary and limited than its continental counterparts\\").  This framework enables closer readings of Stendhal, Goethe, Brontë, Dickens, Flaubert, Balzac, Austen, Pushkin, etc.<br />Implicit in Moretti's thesis is a valorization of all things Napoleonic that gives slightly favorable treatment to those works whose individualism pits the protagonist against a repressive society (Stendhal's Sorel is a fave here), as against the less progressive tendencies of, say, Dickens, whose heroes are constantly checked--and who constantly ALLOW themselves to be checked--in their efforts to reach beyond the lot afforded them by a rigidly hierarchized industrial society (David Copperfield, Pip, etc.).<br />\\"The Way of the World\\" combines an amazing attention to detail with an equally amazing occasional lack of it.  Moretti's readings of Stendhal are at times revelatory, but finally incomplete, as he fails to account for punishments meted out by the text.  Is Stendhal really more progressive than Dickens simply because Stendhal's heroes end up dead and Dickens' end up employed?  This may make the heroes more progressive in Stendhal, but the text seems to perform its own brutal socialization, checking the protagonists even more definitively than Dickens ever does.  Likewise, the lack of treatment of Thackeray, a huge figure who could have single-handedly troubled Moretti's pronouncements on the supposedly conservative English version of the genre, is palpable.<br />The fact is, though, this is an illuminating book.  You won't be able to read anything written in the 19th century the same way afterwards.  Moretti reveals novels for what they are--vicarious testing grounds for various ways of being in the world--and goes a long way toward making us more attentive to what subtle social messages they convey and what those messages can do to us.an Dickens simply because Stendhal's heroes end up dead and Dickens' end up employed?

It's bizarre at times in its pulling situations from left field and making them central to the world of its characters.  It's even more bizarre, though, in its ability to invest these scenarios with legitimate feeling.  For me, that's what makes Saunders' \\"Pastoralia\\" such an interesting, hilarious, and--at times--even heart-warming read: the mixture of the almost inhumanly bizarre on the one hand, and the totally human sentiment on the other.<br />The stories are constructed so that the reader spends the first couple of pages trying to squint at the new world we've been thrown into.  There are things that look familiar--self-help mantras, frustration, common corporate names--but what on earth is with the roast goat?  The pilot-themed male strippers?  The barber's fantasies of love-making in a hacienda?  Slowly, as we work at it, it all comes into focus, and then it's even funnier.  Saunders times this increased clarity (this readerly struggle for clarity) so that it generates an increasing identification with the emotional situation of the protagonists, who are frustrated, limited by their own decisions and by the obligations imposed on them by their loved ones, and doing their best to cope in a civil and civilized way.<br />Saunders is merciless in his parodic cultural contacts: corporate culture, self-help culture, the overly-picky standards of the American male, Jerry Springer culture, the self-consciousness and self-doubt of aging academics, all of them get lampooned to no end.  The collection is well-constructed, though, as most of the pessimism is weighted toward the beginning.  What comes through in the end, then, in the later stories in the collection, is the rare and satisfying moment at which we rise above the ridiculous, at which our humanity trumps our absurdity.  The final story is the best example of this; lost in reveries and longing for a chance at real heroism, a strolling academic is presented with a real, in-process life-or-death situation on the banks of a river.  He can run away, or he can help.  The fate of our worth--of the worth of humanity in general--rests in his hands, and he just might do us proud.<br />\\"Pastoralia\\" tells both sides of the story.  As a collection, though, it builds nicely towards its defining moment.  Saunders leaves us perched there, painfully aware of our failures but with the highest of hopes for what we might still do.  It's a quick read, and a great collection of stories, and I highly recommend it.	2002-09-26

Books	4	21	21	N	N	A Must for Thinking the Political Nietzsche	When this book first came out a couple of decades ago, it represented an early effort at recontextualizing an oeuvre that had always been seen as inapplicable to political considerations.  Today, that apolitical version of Nietzsche is almost unthinkable, and Tracy Strong deserves a lion's share of the credit for that shift.  If you're interested in any facet of Nietzsche's potential as a political thinker, this book is a must.<br />Strong's greatest strength is his ability and willingness to read both the befores and afters that have produced the Nietzsche we thought we knew.  He returns to Nietzsche's prized works, from the Greeks onward (with specific attention to Nietzsche's fave pre-Socratic thinkers) and re-evaluates Nietzsche's appropriations of them.  Simultaneously, Strong always keeps in mind the various ways in which those who came AFTER Nietzsche have read and mis-read these moments.  Such insights go a long way toward making a re-reading of Nietzsche as much about our changing reading agendas as they are about Nietzsche's.<br />Strong also treats our past penchant for linking Nietzsche with darker politics, when we linked him with politics at all; the long-perceived relationship with fascism is given its airing here, but Strong convincingly prods the reader into regarding such strict alliances dubiously.<br />The thoroughness of this book is also impressive.  Strong covers everything, and covers it well.  While he often carefully sets the context every time he cites Nietzsche, though, \\"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of Transfiguration\\" is still guilty of falling into a trap that endangers every book I've read on him: the tendency to regard his thought as one organic whole, always present, rather than as progressive or even disjointed moments.  Because of this, Strong often adduces comments from the much later Nietzsche in order to illuminate statements made earlier in Nietzsche's career.  It is disingenuous, because it implies--in a way that can'tbe right--that what Nietzsche thought in the 1870s was also what he thought in the 1890s.<br />The only other problem I have with Strong concerns some of the readings of more expressly literary texts.  A background of political philosophy, with all of its emphases on explicit arguments and whether they bear scrutiny, reveals itself sometimes as a poor substitute for a more literary interest in what a text conceals as it reveals.  As Strong revisits some of the more literary texts to which Nietzsche refers in \\"The Birth of Tragedy,\\" for example--namely Homer, Greek tragedians, etc.--he reads every passage as a lesson-conveying declaration; this is problematic for Nietzsche, who invested far more at that stage of his thought in anti-coherence than in rational argumentation and presentation.<br />That aside, though, anyone interested in thinking about Nietzsche politically and in how Nietzsche can be thought of as political would do well to pick up a copy of Strong's book.  It is clearly argued, well-written, and still provocative today.	2002-09-26

DeMott's prose is clear and concise, and, unlike some stuffier acadmics, he's not averse to sounding conversational.  This might contribute, in part, to what can only be categorized as an overly conversational reliance on mantras that are never adequately explained in their complexity: \\"the myth of classlessness\\" (America's disbelief in class...sort of) and \\"the omni syndrome\\" (the desire of certain people to be everything to everybody...sort of), for example, are explained well at first but then applied everywhere until their edges start to blur.<br />The strongest chapter is DeMott's historiography of autonomy and individualism in American culture; not coincidentally, this is also his most persuasively, historically grounded chapter, covering educational and media-influenced roots to the crisis.  He buttresses his case with a fine reading of Oliver North's willful flouting of constitutional law, which, DeMott argues, belied a faith in the man over all else: law, politics, public dialogue.<br />Unfortunatley, though, this welcome shot of history comes two thirds of the way through the book, by which time the reader has already been subject to a flagrant anti-history.  The readings of John Hughes's films offered, interesting but one-sided, are a case in point.  DeMott looks at \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" (1987)and \\"Pretty In Pink\\" (1986) but presents the later film first, and then concludes that the two films are identical. (A lot of movie critics at the time, to be fair to DeMott, made the same mistake.)  Thus can he claim that Hughes's movies are always about the erosion of class boundaries, supporting the \\"myth of classlessness\\" by subsuming everyone into the \\"Imperial Middle.\\"  This is not the case, though, unless you ignore the narrative structure of the films. The endings of the films--intra-class romance vs. the rejection of it--are radically different. Clearly, something was going on in America that could account for such a shift in accepted plotting, but the book doesn't interest itself in this particular historical rupture.<br />This weakness touches as well on a paradox central to his argument. For, while DeMott claims that Americans foster a fantasy of American culture as \\"classless,\\" he repeatedly uses the notion of upward social mobility to support other points. How can a society so ambivalent about the possibility of class be so ardent in their pursuit of rising from one class to another?<br />It's entertaining reading--especially the stories of politicians, like Gore, Dole, and Bush, Sr., trying to make themselves into \\"working men\\"--and often provocative.  But, often, \\"The Imperial Middle\\" feels more relentlessly polemical than carefully thoughtful.	2002-09-08
US	50202496	R2IQEJL2H46WBP	0452262054	938422940	Ibsen:  The Complete Major Prose Plays	Books	5	32	33	N	N	Amazing collection, great translation, great extras...	There will not be a better collected edition of these plays in English translation.  For both casual readers and scholars unable to read Ibsen in the original Norwegian, Rolf Fjelde's translation and supplementary materials make this volume unbeatable.<br />Fjelde presents Ibsen's major prose plays (which leaves out, of course, beauties like \\"Peer Gynt\\" but includes \\"A Doll House,\\" \\"Ghosts,\\" \\"An Enemy of the People,\\" and \\"Hedda Gabler,\\" among others) in fresh new translations, often altering standard misuses.  He explains, for example, that traditional renderings of \\"Et dukkehjem\\" as \\"A Doll's House\\" warp its real meaning, which is simply \\"A Doll House.\\"  Pedantic as it may appear, this care is necessary, and evident throughout.<br />Even better are the almost 100 pages of extras: detailed introductions to each play, as well as minutely researched production histories.  Who knew, for example, that \\"Ghosts\\" premiered not in Denmark or Norway but...Chicago, in 1882?  The production notes and introduction to the volume tell a story we don't often hear about Ibsen, a tale of difficulties in Scandinavia, followed by years of exile and, ultimately, international acclaim.  Reading the plays, which seem to have become more and more specifically Norwegian in setting and theme while Ibsen himself became more and more cosmopolitan, conjures memories of another exile who only ever wrote about home: James Joyce, not coincidentally one of Ibsen's greatest admirers.<br />For the price, you can't do better for English translations of these pieces--many of which can't be found elsewhere--whether you're a scholar in need of the historical context Fjelde obligingly provides, or simply interested in plowing through some of the foundations of 20th century and contemporary drama.	2002-09-08
US	50202496	RDEY37CNCJ6UU	0316592102	885138585	Demonology: Stories	Books	4	2	4	N	N	Fantastic, emotionally charged collection	I had already read several of these stories in the New Yorker and heard others at readings, but those previews took nothing away from the fact that Rick Moody's \\"Demonology\\" is a powerful collection of short fiction.  Despite some weak spots (like &quot;Pan's Fair Throng,&quot; which I couldn't bring myself to finish), Moody lays down one moving story after another, making for a diverse and satisfying read.<br />My favorite pieces here are the ones in which Moody does what he does best and what few of his contemporaries dare to do: strive for emotional climaxes that are well-earned, not cynical but not naïve, and incapable of being overly sentimental or cheesy.  The first story, \\"Mansion on the Hill,\\" is probably the best example of all that will follow.  Moody leavens a heavy emotional backdrop (the narrator is writing a letter to his departed sister on the event of her fiancé's marriage to another woman) with outrageous humor (his job wearing a chicken mask, the strange inner workings of a wedding production company) and the effect is beautiful and bittersweet.<br />Moody has all the humor of writers like Michael Chabon and Douglas Coupland, and the same comic cultural awareness.  What sets \\"Demonology\\" apart, though, are some of the cleverer, more experimental stories that aren't stories so much as, well, liner notes for a CD box set representing the evolution of a certain Wilkie Fahnstock's listening habits, from the Almann Brothers to Aphex Twin; or a book catalogue that becomes a journey into a comically unhealthy crush that the cataloguer can't seem to put behind him.  This willingness to push the boundaries of his chosen format while still producing classically satisfying narratives puts Moody in a class all his own.<br />But the more lyrical moments are just as powerful, often reminiscent of the astonishing first chapter of \\"Purple America,\\" and possessed of a motion dictated more by feel than by grammar.  It is this mode (in full effect in this collection in stories like \\"Drawer\\" and \\"Boys\\") that gives many readers of Moody trouble; it is true that he can be a difficult read at times, but it's a price well worth paying for the reward his stories often carry at their end.<br />I loved \\"Demonology\\" and would recommend it highly, although readers should bear Moody's occasionally difficult, Virginia Woolf-ish prose in mind.  In my opinion, he's worth the sweat, and each story's pay-off sticks with you for a while after you put the book down.  If you prefer the blunter style of Hemingway, though, most of these stories may not be to your liking.	2002-06-17

Moving quickly but without forsaking the kinds of detailed narration that bring a story to life, Haggard's novel is an engaging treasure hunt of the Indiana Jones variety.<br />The book is styled as a long chronicle written by safari-leader Allan Quatermain to his son, describing a hunt for the lost diamond mines of King Solomon in the heart of Africa.  Haggard peppers the tale with nods to real life that go out of their way to convince us that everything we are reading is true--editorial comments purportedly added later, for example--and the result is a compellingly detailed read.  It is clear that Haggard knew Africa well, and his framing of this knowledge within a focused and nicely spun-out plot pulls you right through the book to its climactic finale, which I should probably allow you, after you've traipsed across deserts and tamed native unrest with the narrator and his companions, to discover for yourself.<br />So, \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" is a well-constructed read, but another of its strong points, the humor that is so central to the story, forces a look at the bigger context.  Haggard takes solid jokes (like Good's pasty white legs, for which he is assumed to be a god by the natives) and, like David Letterman, returns to them at intervals in a manner that always uses them in a new way but lets the reader think that he or she is on the inside, slyly being chucked on the shoulder by the narrator.<br />It's this penchant for humor that gets a little uncomfortable once you think about it, because you can't help but compare Haggard's novel here to another journey to the center of Africa written two decades later, Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" which is conspicuously devoid of laughter unless it's the very evil kind.  Haggard's novel is immensely entertaining--I don't want to deny that for a second--but it glosses over some very real problems that Conrad is more careful about: imperialism and its disastrous universe of consequences.<br />I probably shouldn't stand in judgment of Haggard for his take on and his playing to the racial politics of his day, but I'm going to do it anyway because Haggard was, in his day, one of the most widely read writers writing.  Adventures like \\"King Solomon's Mines\\" set the bar for the British male for decades and, if it taught him to be a gentleman and fair-player, it also grounded this ethos in the belief that he was superior both socially and racially.  Thus is it the gentlemanly westerners who manage to import due process into African law in this novel, and thus does Captain Good's native love-interest ultimately recuse herself from his affections because, as a white man, he is like the sun.  And what can possibly be good enough to mate with the sun?, she asks.  Disturbing, in retrospect.<br />This gripping adventure story gets four stars by virtue of its great plot and skillful spinning-out of that plot.  It misses the fifth star because it buys wholeheartedly into the myths on which centuries of imperial violence were founded.  And no matter how enjoyable this novel is, it's hard to chase those ghosts away.problems that Conrad is more careful about: imperialism and its disastrous universe of consequences.<br />I probably shouldn't stand in judgment of Haggard for his take on and his playing to the racial politics of his day, but I'm going to do it anyway because Haggard was, in his day, one of the most widely read writers writing.

US	50202496	RYS9DK7SWXNRC	015626224X	789289309	Down and Out in Paris and London	Books	5	41	47	N	N	The Real Kitchen and Hitchinï¿½ Confidential	Like most of us, I read Orwell in high school (\\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\") and remained largely unaware that hed written anything that didnt involve either talking Trotskyite animals or a terrifyingly functional dystopia.  A friend of mine gave me Down and Out in Paris and London a month ago, and I was unable to put it down until I was done.  In what is basically the chronicle of a couple of months of self-induced misery, Orwell explodes a lot of myths surrounding poverty and the spirit-breaking labor that is, for many, the only exit from it.<br />We know the gist of the book: Orwell sets up shop amongst the common people, first washing dishes in various Paris restaurants and then tramping around London and environs.  Proceeding via introductions and anecdotes--some hilariously funny, others downright heart-rending--Down and Out in Paris and London offers a detailed tour of a side of life that most of us will only ever read about.  From the painstaking descriptions of exactly what kind of muck is to be found on the floor of a restaurants kitchen in 1920s and 1930s Paris (you dont want to know, but he tells you) to elaborations on how to skirt begging laws in London and the dangers associated with such living, Orwell makes his points, one after the other.  To his credit, though, there is little dogmatic moralizing; when, at the end of the book, he tells you what hes learned, he doesnt seem to feel the need to shove down the readers throat what is clearly stuck in his own.  The feeling is strong, though, that youd have to be blind, crazy or both, not to reach the same conclusions.<br />The greatest strength of Down and Out, though, is the manner in which Orwell never attempts to pass himself off as one of the people he is pretending to be.  The English band Pulp has a song about rich kids slumming with the common people, but the song points out that, if the going ever really got tough, the rich kids can always call Daddy and have him bail them out.  Orwell has to realize that he is in that same privileged situation; his tramping in London, for example, is simply to kill time until he can take up a legitimate position, and, along the way, he is able to borrow money several times from a friend in order to make ends meet.  This distance that he subtly maintains between himself and those who have little choice in their fate only adds punch to the lessons he learns, and Orwells probably privileged reader (at least privileged enough to spend money on books) is permitted to learn alongside him.<br />There are picky complaints that could be lodged here--the untranslated French passages, for example, which will leave at a loss those without high school French--but, overall, Down and Out in Paris and London is a great read, one of those few books that manages to be both entertaining and properly disturbing.  It has all the wit and scoop of later efforts like Bourdains recent best-seller, Kitchen Confidential, or Ehrenreichs Nickel and Dimed, but Down and Out, after bigger game than Bourdain and less unforgivably preachy than Ehrenreich, manages to dig deeper under your skin and stay there longer.  And that, as Orwell concludes, is a beginning.	2002-05-27

His books on the IRA and the Troubles are standards, and his critical biography of de Valera has probably forever changed the way Ireland's largest-looming political figure will be seen.  Unfortunately, \\"Wherever Green Is Worn\\" does not match Coogan's best work.  It is sprawling and lacks focus, and this cannot entirely be his fault; despite the book's merits, I can't help but feel that it is ultimately just another rushed attempt by his publishers to cash in on the popularity of Irish culture.<br />The chief and indisputable strength of \\"Wherever Green Is Worn\\" is its ground-breaking sweep.  Nobody has attempted this universal an examination of the Irish diaspora, and this becomes both an unassailable strength of Coogan's work and a dangerous pitfall, as I'll explain later.  Suffice it to say, for now, that this book is a useful first word on the topic and will hopefully provoke more thorough and concentrated historiographies to fill in gaps and tell the story with more critical focus.<br />And now, to pickier stuff, because it's crucially symptomatic of the overall way in which Coogan's newest contribution has suffered from the inattentiveness of his publishers at St. Martin's, who really owed their author a better editor than he got.<br />1) First, there are numerous typos and grammatical errors in the book, with the greatest concentration in the initial pages.<br />2) Slightly more embarrassing is the misspelling of gratuitous foreign phrases, like the italicized French \\"trahison des clercs,\\" which Coogan spells two different ways in the course of the book; if you have to throw high-falutin' French phrases around, you really want to get them right.<br />3) Then, there are errors in the Irish (and I find this more troubling because, as a language working to reassert itself, Irish does not need to be misused in major publications like this one) when in an endnote Coogan inexplicably renders the Irish for \\"kiss my arse\\" (\\"p&oacute;g mo th&oacute;in\\") as \\"pogue mo tuin.\\"  (I pointed this out in amazement to a friend from Co. Kildare, and his response was, \\"Of course Coogan doesn't know Irish, he's a Dub!\\")<br />4) The discursive tangents are another thing a good editor could have attenuated.  Do we need to know that the author's luggage was once lost in Boston, unless there's a point to the story or, at the very least, a punchline?  Do such digressions explain why \\"Wherever Green Is Worn\\" is swollen out to almost 800 pages?<br />5) Finally, the page references are dodgy, as if the editors didn't track the changes in pagination through the successive drafts of the book.  We are told, on page 386, that Coogan will discuss the nineteenth-century Fenian incursions into British Canadian territory on pages 408-410, but that's not the case.  The discussion comes on 390, and Coogan's maps of his own book are useless, most likely thanks to careless editing that failed to account for numbering shifts during production.<br />This is not even to mention the occasionally chauvinistic posture that peeks out in discussions of women in \\"Wherever Green Is Worn.\\"  \\"Caroline Marland may have the looks of a top model, but she is Managing Director of Guardian News Ltd,\\" Coogan writes on 129, and I wish this were the only time such a remark were let through (it happens several times in the book).  No matter how unnecessary it is, no matter how irrelevant to the topic at hand, we are never spared the observation of an attractive woman.<br />These are fairly petty criticisms.  However, what all of this indicates to me is that nobody took very much time preparing or proofing the manuscript of \\"Wherever Green Is Worn,\\" and this shows through, painfully.  Coogan admits in the introduction that he was compelled by his publishers to write no less than three other books (the better ones on Collins, de Valera, and the Troubles) while researching \\"Wherever Green Is Worn,\\" and this goes along way toward explaining why the book feels disjunctive and lacks any cohesion; in fact, many of its most powerful moments are precisely those in which Coogan is able to draw from his more sustained research into de Valera and the Troubles, recontextualized to foreground their impact on the diasporic Irish.  As it is, individual episodes are instructive and entertaining, anecdotal though they often are.  It's just the bigger picture that feels blurry.<br />And, ultimately, the question that organizes this book is left disappointingly unanswered: Who are the \\"Irish diaspora\\" mentioned in the title?  Those who, born in Ireland, later emigrated?  Those who were born abroad to Irish parents?  Those who, so-called \\"plastic Paddies\\" like myself, have an Irish passport but were born and raised outside of Ireland?  One of the problems in this book is that EVERYBODY'S IRISH.  Because Irishness becomes in \\"Wherever Green Is Worn\\" (which turns out to be, well, everywhere) far too broad a concept, it loses any real value as a category.  A tighter definition of the driving motif behind Coogan's study would have lent this book much more focus and power.aining why the book feels disjunctive and lacks any cohesion; in fact, many of its most powerful moments are precisely those in which Coogan is able to draw from his more sustained research into de Valera and the Troubles, recontextualized to foreground their impact on the diasporic Irish.

It was helpful as a pocket reference for store-front signs and very basic reading vocabulary, but the biggest thing to recommend it, apart from the low price, is the fact that there aren't many alternatives here. With Berlitz, you get 12,000 terms in each language, which will get you around town but not help much with words that have even the slightest disciplinary specificity or currency to them (the word 'e-mail,' for example, is absent, as are many other words that have seeped into everyday use, and this might be due to this dictionary's not having been updated since 1994).<br />The good things about this dictionary are its pronunciation guide (this is actually much more than a good thing, as even more thorough dictionaries I saw in Denmark didn't have this) and its handy reference pages, which give you the quick run-down on how to tell time, for example, or read a menu. In this way, it feels like a guide for beginning learners of the language or tourists. There's nothing wrong with that, but Berlitz ought to indicate this on the cover.<br />It's a good dictionary for the price, and it's perfectly suited to beginning learners of Danish and for short travels. If you plan on using it as a reference guide for reading or for more advanced Danish, you'd do well to look further.	2002-04-26

Everest Disaster	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A stunning, tragic read	Call it curiosity, call it an absorbing adventure, or blame it on the fact that I was sick in bed and couldn't really do anything but read.  Or just call it a disturbing report of the last days of some fascinating people, a report that is written so tightly that you can't put it down because it won't let you.  This is what Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" was for me.<br />It is so rare that a piece of fact-based or even historical narrative works so well as a book.  I credit the author's sensitive ears and eyes, which allowed him to recreate the speech and look of a cast of disparate characters in what becomes one of the saddest accounts of hubris and tragic ill-fatedness I have ever read.<br />What is most impressive to me about this book, though, is the delicate balance Krakauer is able to strike between his own guilt at having survived to tell the story (something Holocaust historians refer to as \\"survivor guilt\\") and his own need to tell it.  There is a fair amount of perhaps justified self-flagellation, but at no point does it overwhelm the narrative.  Otherwise put, Krakauer treats the tragedy with enough reverence not to bury it under the story of his own guilt; \\"Into Thin Air\\" may bill itself as \\"A Personal Account of the Mt. Everest Disaster,\\" but Krakauer makes certain that it is not about him, for it is about those who were lost and those who loved them.  This is driven home powerfully in the epilogue, during which the author presents some quite harsh criticism leveled against him by victims' families, and he does so without responding, without succumbing to the temptation to get the last word in despite his being in a prime position to do so.<br />\\"Into Thin Air,\\" like all great books, tells us about much more than the episode that is its most local concern.  The culprit in this story--and this is made clear on so many levels--is money.  Everest is now a commercial venture, the book makes clear, and mountaineering companies feeling the financial pinch areforced to \\"summit\\" climbers who are perhaps not ready or worthy of summiting, just to keep good word of mouth going, just to keep new clients coming, just to stay in business.<br />Krakauer gives us an alternative to this, though, in his well-researched and thoughtfully presented historical snippets.  There was a time, we learn, when those who knew Everest best knew it as an adventure, and not as an economic enterprise.  When the curiosity of the explorers becomes the claim-staking of the colonizers--when venture capital must be protected--questions that should arise are beaten back.  Everest was far too high a peak to be carelessly embroiled in bottom lines, and, in this book as in life, too much attention to the bottom line means suffering at a much higher cost.  Krakauer is careful not to pound this point home, but he makes it felt.<br />All of this aside, though, \\"Into Thin Air\\" is quite simply a well-written, brilliantly told, and carefully respectful rendering of a sad, sad chapter in the lives of some beautiful and brave human beings.	2002-03-12

My first foray into the work of the most famous detective novelist in English literature was both better and worse than I expected it would be.  Doyle writes in fascinating detail, but ultimately his means of plotting \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" will slightly disappoint today's readers.<br />The best thing about this novel is the world that the author creates in and around it, a world replete with mystery and unidentifiable threat and foreboding.  Characters are drawn early and drawn well, usually via a pseudo-scientific narrative that presents visible traits or facts and then draws conclusions from there.  In so doing, Doyle fits himself snugly into the realist tradition going back at least as far as Balzac's earliest novels, but Holmes' pre-occupation with scientific method pushes this even further until he becomes a sort of storyteller within a story; each clue leads to a supposition that is just as often speculative fiction as it is right on the money.  The effect of this is one of the necessary components of great detective fiction: that is, we readers are presented with solutions that are not correct and that necessarily keep us reading until we get the correct one.  Doyle does this well.<br />However, it's another necessary component of today's detective fiction that is missing in \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" and that this reader missed dearly: the right solution, carefully and mischievously tucked into the narrative along the way.  Part of why we read detective stories is to see whether we are as good at solving them as the detective in the story is, and Doyle refuses to allow us to do that.  I don't want to give the ending away, but I will say by way of complaint that it comes from left field, and in such a way that the reader never could have guessed it.  The writer of such a tale would today be accused of lazy emplotment.  The best counter-example to this is the masterful job done by someone like Scott Turow; the power of \\"Presumed Innocent\\" is largely that, when the mystery is revealed, we realize that we should have seen it all along, just like the protagonist did (although 99% of us DON'T see it all along, because Turow is that subtle).  We have been teased and held in the dark not just by Turow, but by the narrator we have come to trust.  When the plot is done right, the ending should feel like an ending to the story we've just been told, and not the introduction of something completely new.<br />Despite that fact--the fact that Doyle won't let me play detective--\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is an enjoyable read and offers insight into the earliest avatars of today's most popular type of fiction.gely that, when the mystery is revealed, we realize that we should have seen it all along, just like the protagonist did (although 99% of us DON'T see it all along, because Turow is that subtle).

Jay can easily be forgiven his occasional historiographer's dryness and insistent reminders of the boundaries of his project (I would be a rich man if I had a nickel for every time he writes that \\"such considerations fall outside of the area of the current inquiry\\" or something to that effect).  Moreover, even if subsequent publications of the translated correspondence and unpublished papers of figures like Benjamin and Adorno have robbed Jay's book of some of its potential for novelty and scoop, Jay still provides the best and most pithy assessments of the major points, and he does so without sacrificing the scholarly rigor that organizes \\"The Dialectical Imagination.\\"<br />The book could certainly better fulfill its role as research tool if the publishers would sponsor an updating of the notes and citations; now that everything has been published and republished by presses like Fischer and Suhrkamp in Germany and by the likes of Continuum, Columbia, Harvard, etc., in the English-speaking world, Jay's opus might be more helpful were it not to insist on citing the original issues of the institute's journals, to which most of us simply don't have easy access.<br />That's a small bone to pick, though, with such a thorough book.  Jay's chapter on the philosophical roots of critical theory moves quickly but surely (despite the occasional dependence on disciplinary argot that may slow down readers not steeped in the vocabulary of \\"isms\\"), providing a crucial backdrop to his reading of the Frankfurt School's entire intellectual contribution.  This chapter grounds Jay's book safely, and the subsequent chapters make good on this very promising start.<br />\\"The Dialectical Imagination\\" is sure to remain the best available introduction to the thought of the Frankfurt School on the whole.  I cannot recommend it highly enough for those interested in the history of philosophy in the 20th century, in radical politics, or in developments in literary theory.I cannot recommend it highly enough for those interested in the history of philosophy in the 20th century, in radical politics, or in developments in literary theory.	2002-01-07

Boyle's \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" is a well-told and impressively written story that approaches some of the most difficult and pressing questions facing Americans today, questions involving who we are and want to be, and how open we are and want to be.  Because it succeeds to a large degree in its provocations and plot, \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" is a great read, and I recommend it.<br />The key words here are migration and assimilation, in this case of Mexican itinerant laborer Cándido and his young, pregnant wife, América.  Boyle cleverly and effectively frames their story and the story of the Southern Californians, Delaney and Kyra, within assimilations of older migration stories: Voltaire's \\"Candide\\" and Steinbeck's \\"Grapes of Wrath.\\"  The alternately ironic and literal invocation of these two older works allows Boyle to infuse \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" with both the black-comic tendencies of Voltaire's novella and the portrayal and condemnation of social injustices so central to Steinbeck's masterpiece.<br />Nicely paced and well-written, Boyle permits the chapters to alternate between the Americans and the newly-arrived Mexicans until, in a powerful narrative moment towards the end, once it has become apparent that the two worlds are inextricably intertwined, the chapters begin to deal with both halves of the novel's world at once.  Not only does the plot start to move even more quickly at this point, but the tensions are doubled, and the sense of too many people and not enough room that dogs the thinking of many of the American characters in \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" makes itself starkly felt.<br />Strangely, it's at precisely this point that things start to feel less tight.  The carefully plotted earlier sections of the novel make it all the more apparent that Boyle seems to be throwing things in during the last few chapters (where did Delaney's gun suddenly come from, for example?) in a sort of hasty authorial clean-up.  Likewise, the nuance and complexity beginto devolve into a preachiness that is hammered home in the novel's final line; Boyle seems to have tired of the legitimate difficulty of the situation, and instead finally delivers us a hero.<br />Still, this novel is well worth the time.  It is an often funny, often heartbreaking read.  Even some of the less likable characters are rendered in a friendly manner, and this makes the whole world of \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" feel very real.  But even more real than the novelistic world of Boyle's creation are the painful political and social problems to which he rightfully draws our attention.	2002-01-06
US	50202496	R2QBCO3U0XF5IT	0385333854	710547068	Woody Guthrie: A Life	Books	5	48	49	N	N	Biography of a Nation	It's hard for a book that comes so highly recommended to avoid ultimately being a bit of a disappointment, but Joe Klein's fine biography of Woody Guthrie does just that.  Full-bodied and balanced, \\"Woody Guthrie: A Life\\" gives a very complete picture of an amazing life.  The only disappointment here is reaching the end, both of Klein's book and of Guthrie's fascinating life.<br />Klein's extensive research is the first key to this book's success; he is able to show so many different sides of one of America's greatest songwriters that Guthrie becomes ever more complex even as he becomes ever more human.  Equally as important, though, is the manner in which Klein unblinkingly and impartially tells the bad along with the good.  So what comes out in the long run is exactly how brilliant, industrious, flighty, difficult to live with, insufferable, and ingenious Woody Guthrie was.  Klein's prose and its conversational ease spin out this long yarn, detours included, in a fluent and friendly tone that reflect well the topic at hand.<br />Readers expecting mere annotations to Guthrie's music will be surprised to find much more in this book--I know I was.  I was shocked to be allowed a glimpse into familial and erotic life.  None of this interested me at first, and even seemed like an unwanted accompaniment to the real story of the music, but Klein quickly makes it clear that this corner of Guthrie's life had its own impact on his creative energies in every other area, and the gaps get filled in.<br />This completeness contributes to a portrait that quickly overgrows the confines of a single American life, for Guthrie's story is in many ways the complex story of America in the last century.  Klein's telling of this story allows us a glimpse into histories we've forgotten or have been allowed to forget.  How many of us knew, for example, that there were 3 million communists in the USA before WWII?  Their history has been muted for a long time, but their role and the role of labor unions in the formation of America--and their quick and precipitous decline--play continually in the background of this biography.<br />I highly recommend this book not just as a biography of Woody Guthrie but as a mapping of the American 20th century, as an explanation of how we became what we are and how we're still becoming, of how far we've come and how far we still have to go.	2002-01-06

In wonderfully varied pieces, \\"My Favourite Year\\" captures a broad band of moods and shows just how multi-faceted our reactions to soccer--and, at a deeper level, our approaches to remembering--are.<br />For someone not acquainted with the world of (mostly) English football (there are inclusions here as well of Scottish, Welsh, and Irish teams), some of these essays may be a tough go.  I'd be tempted to say that the best pieces here are the most widely accessible ones--that is, the ones that cater to a more general public--but that wouldn't be true.  The elation of Roddy Doyle's opening salvo could capture anyone's attention, since it seems less about soccer than about infectiously good memories.  But some of the most interesting and powerful glimpses here will be impenetrable to those with little knowledge of the inner workings of club politics in England; Ed Horton's amazing probing of the woeful and criminal mismanagement of Oxford United is both engaging and important, but I confess that some of its finer points were lost on this American reader, despite the fact that I know a fair amount about the background.<br />So, unlike Hornby's \\"Fever Pitch,\\" which manages to make itself about life-in-general masquerading as life-in-soccer, this collection might be a little harder to penetrate for the casual observer of the beautiful game.  If you're a bigger fan of the sport, I highly recommend it, especially during the upcoming World Cup year 2002.  \\"My Favourite Year\\" is a great hors-d'oeuvre for a month-long World Cup meal of soccer at its best.	2002-01-06

Julian Young points out in the first few pages of his essay that Nietzsche's aesthetics is the most ignored aspect of his thought.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend \\"Nietzsche's Philosophy of Art\\" as the needed remedy.  Readers will be sorely disappointed if they approach Young's book expecting it actually to occupy itself with the area of inquiry to which its title explicitly points.<br />Young admits that his book, despite its title, \\"constitutes a kind of biography: not a biography in the usual sense but rather a philosophical biography, a record of the twists and turns taken by Nietzsche's philosophy viewed through the prism of his philosophy of art\\" (2).  This biography has \\"four main periods,\\" according to Young, and runs roughly thus: pessimistic, not-so-pessimistic, almost-optimistic, once-more-pessimistic (1).  The \\"main purpose\\" of the chapter on &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot; is, for example, to answer \\"this question: whether [Nietzsche] also endorsed Schopenhauer's pessimism; whether, that is, he endorsed Schopenhauer's inference from the pain and purposelessness of human existence to its worthlessness\\" (26).  In case you were wondering, Young has published previously on Schopenhauer, and the argument here goes further to cast a Schopenhauerian shadow over Nietzsche than to more generally (and perhaps fairly) probe Nietzsche's thoughts on art.<br />This insistence on diachrony in Young's approach to Nietzsche's thought forces some unfortunate groupings made to serve the argument's ultimate end, which is more heavily invested in the question of when and whether Nietzsche's philosophy is pessimistic or optimistic than in the question of what Nietzsche felt art was, what it could do, and how it could do it.  (I think that the alternative to this evolution-of-a-writer's-thought approach is often equally unhelpful, though, as in Tracy Strong's book on Nietzsche's politics, which considers his thought as one organic totality and tends to see later statements as part and parcel of earlier ones, even when blatantly contradictory.  Perhaps the real answer is to look at each of Nietzsche's works one by one.  I don't know.)<br />Then there's the lack of real engagement with extant scholarship on the topic of Nietzsche's aesthetics (a lack probably due to the lack of real engagement with Nietzsche's aesthetics, except perhaps in the discussion of his views on naturalism).  Silk and Stern's opus on Nietzsche's conception of tragedy is not given the attention it deserves, nor is Strong's work on Nietzsche's broader imagining of drama and its potential, and Sloterdijk's essay on Nietzsche's \\"Birth of Tragedy\\" isn't even mentioned.<br />All of which makes for a slightly deceptive book-buying experience.  If you're interested in Nietzsche's relationship to Schopenhauer or in whether Nietzsche was a pessimist, you might have a better time reading Young's essay than I had.  But if you, like me, are looking for a book on \\"Nietzsche's Philosophy of Art,\\" look further.	2002-01-02

Its creditable intentions and seemingly careful explanations draw you in quickly, and Ben Jelloun's economical prose has all the virtues of a well-prepared lesson with none of the overwhelming preachiness.  And it is this patience of demeanor that makes this such a dangerous book, for Ben Jelloun's argument here ends up reproducing, with a gentle and seductive touch, the same limited and limiting mindset of the racism he sets out to \\"explain.\\"<br />The topic is, of course, timely, and as acclaimed a writer as Ben Jelloun is perhaps more prepared than most to take on the task.  He proceeds step by step with his clarifications, defining difficult terms in often sensible ways, all the while using a form of prose that has very long roots as an expository genre: the dialogue.  This format allows the daughter's voice to anticipate the very questions and demands for greater clarity that are simultaneously arising in the reader's mind.  And her father is happy to simplify.<br />And that's just the problem.  Racism is not a simple thing.  Ben Jelloun is to be commended for his attempt, but there is strength in not knowing, and greater strength in admitting that one doesn't know-just ask Socrates, the ancient master of the dialogue.  Socrates would have paled trying to explain racism.  To his credit, Ben Jelloun includes numerous critiques (letters sent to him from readers, things said by students during his tour of schools in France and Italy) of the earlier edition of &quot;Racism Explained&quot; and, while these afford an opportunity for showing the real complexity of racism, they also reinforce the poverty of his own argument.<br />And what's wrong with his argument?  Ben Jelloun wants to break things down very carefully and be fair, and he gives every appearance of doing so, but it is only an appearance.  The problem with this project ultimately revolves around the fact that, in order to discredit racism, Ben Jelloun relies on the same reductive worldview that causes racism in the first place, the same lack of vision that only sees things in opposed pairs: black/white, good/bad, us/them.  Thus can his daughter, at the book's end, declare that \\"racists are b**tards [salauds].\\"  She has learned well how to ignore multifarious causes and use instead blanket judgments.  Substitute any sub-group for \\"racists\\" in her equation, and you've got the beginnings of hate: for Hitler, it was \\"Jews,\\" for Falwell it's \\"homosexuals,\\" etc.  Racists are many things, but not all racists are one thing.<br />Ben Jelloun once said of James Joyce that Joyce's work is so revolutionary because it \\"works on language,\\" and Ben Jelloun's own novels have performed this revolution often over the last decade.  Sadly, when a fine author decides to take on social issues at a more explicit and obvious level, the humanity and nuance fade, and all we're left with is a choice between two worldviews: that of the reductionist explainers, and that of the racist b**tards.<br />Precisely because of its pretensions to fairness, sober-mindedness and tolerance, this could very well be one of the most dangerous books I've read.  It gets three stars for the discussion that forms around the critiques included at the end (the only sustained dose of reality in the book) and for the discussion I hope it will provoke here in the USA.	2001-12-20
US	50202496	RC7PYXABMP24R	0671039725	769595666	Carrie	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An effectively harrowing and haunting read	I picked up \\"Carrie\\" after a 15-year hiatus from Stephen King's fiction (although I read his memoir on writing last year and enjoyed it a lot), and it was a slap in the face reminding me that I need to read more of his stuff. \\"Carrie\\" is a heavy articulation of the inexplicable and how we react to what we don't understand. And, given the recent spate of revenge-style schoolyard shootings across the country, \\"Carrie\\" also sticks out as a prescient social commentary. If only we'd listened. <br />While other reviewers have been bothered by the narrative's melange of fictional, narrated segments and purportedly factual excerpts from trial transcripts, academic publications, etc.--and even what looks like a Xerox of a coroner's report--I think it's crucial to understanding one of the levels on which King's novel works so well. Part of what's at stake in \\"Carrie\\" is the relationship between fact and fiction, and how this relates directly to our understanding of what we can and cannot know, what we can and cannot explain. The cross-examinations of Carrie's friend Sue Snell drive this point home toward the novel's end; Sue is repeatedly asked how she \\"knew\\" what she is telling the court, given the haziness of the evening's events, and all that she can reply is, How do we \\"know\\" anything? This plays powerfully throughout one's experience of King's novel, because it begs a discussion of how something that we know is fiction (and thus not \\"true\\") can have such a powerfully visceral effect on us (read some of the many reviews on this site for evidence of how effective the horror in \\"Carrie\\" is). This is big game for a novel written so early in a writer's career, and King handles it well, opening up all sorts of questions that demand answers but that resist those answers with hostility. <br />Recent events have shown just how accurate King's portrayal of the cruelties of the American high school experience has been, and he is also right on the money with a media critique (the tragedy's survivors are turned into celebrities and memoirists, and Reader's Digest chimes in with a ridiculous \\"Drama In Real Life\\" contribution). Where the coolness quotient is the center of every high school, beware of those on the margins. King's conclusion is even more ominous in its suggestion that this cycle is unbreakable. <br />And what about that surprising conclusion? What's most amazing about it, perhaps, is that it's not a surprise, not one bit of it. From fifty pages into the novel, King has already told us who will die (hundreds of high school students, most of whom have been terribly cruel to the protagonist, and a few others from the town), who will be responsible (Carrie herself), and how it will be done (a tragic fire in the high school on Prom Night). The true test of his authorly mettle is that you read on anyway, and you are unable to stop. It's not surprises and expectations that push the reader of \\"Carrie\\" to the end; it's more like a voyeuristic need to actually see what we've already been told. This marks King off--along with Highsmith, maybe--as the truest heir to Edgar Allen Poe in American letters. <br />Even the few moments that ring slightly false or unfriendly in this novel (high schoolers thinking like four-star generals, for example, or the pretty drastic portrayal of Christian fundamentalists) are never less than interesting. \\"Carrie\\" is a powerful and powerfully disturbing look at how people try to come to grips with those different to them, and how often and catastrophically they fail.<BR>	2001-08-25

I liked the first installment of Bridget's misadventures in singleness a great deal, and I had high expectations going into round two, &quot;The Edge of Reason.&quot; Despite my high expectations, Fielding's sequel delivered on every count, perhaps going even further than the first novel in its engagement with the more comic side of contemporary gender relations in British culture.<br />If you liked &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary,&quot; I have a hard time believing you wouldn't like this book just as much as the first. The tone is similar but more assured (the diary data at the outset of each chapter, for example, are far more varied and inventive in this second book), and we get more hijinks with our favorite wackoes from the first book (including the pathetic Daniel Cleaver) and meet even newer wackoes, like Gary the professional Builder but impassioned part-time...angler?<br />What I liked even better about this book, though, was that Fielding pulls no emplotment punches and riddles the narrative with one out-of-left-field surprise after another. These surprises often amount to little more than local episodes that are opened and wrapped within a chapter or two, but others become jokes that run (and run well) for the duration of the novel, including the mishaps in Thailand, the speculations over the sexual orientation of one of Bridget's uncles, and the ridiculously exoticist treatment of a young African man by Bridget's mother.<br />Which leads me (in a roundabout way) to the final thing that makes this novel, for me at least, as timely as it is fun: &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; seems more willing to address (even if only via satire) contemporary social ills than Fielding's first novel did.  While &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; seemed to confine its attention to Bridget's relationship woes (and I'm not complaining about that focus at all), &quot;The Edge of Reason&quot; parodies British attitudes toward race, globalization, sexuality, and broader discussions ofgender (the constant pokes at Nick Hornby's figuring of today's British male are especially funny).  While the engagement with these topics is far from thorough, I do think that it broaches its chosen social themes in a gentle way.<br />In short, I am confident that fans of the first volume of Bridget's diary will like this second tome at least as much. Does Fielding have another one in her? I hope so.	2001-08-25
US	50202496	R32WQHKO4GLK88	156025355X	59832297	The Betrayal of America: How the Supreme Court Undermined the Constitution and Chose Our President (Nation Books)	Books	3	9	17	N	N	Great observations, poor organization and untempered vitriol	I thought I was angry about the Bush v. Gore verdict, but Vincent Bugliosi's ANGRY.  VERY angry.  So angry that you can smell his wounded sense of justice wafting from the pages of this book.  As anyone who has read him knows, he has an incisive and often very commonsensical style and legal mind; unfortunately for his fine arguments made in &quot;The Betrayal of America,&quot; his insights are too often barbed with ad hominem attacks on the SC justices and the Bushies, bringing a strident tone that will play foully with all but those who already agree with him.  In that sense, then--in the sense that he's preaching to the converted--&quot;The Betrayal of America&quot; is an informative but wasted effort.<br />Don't get me wrong--there are some great arguments set forth and observations made in this book.  Among the more interesting and fruitful moments are Bugliosi's castigation of the Gore legal team for what he describes as an utter failure under pressure.  He highlights several arguments that could have--no, SHOULD have--been made by Boies and Tribe in the interest of their client.  And their client was not just Gore, as Bugliosi repeatedly points out, but also the popular majority (in the nation as well as in Florida) who voted for him.<br />Gore was not the only victim here, the author reminds us; we all were.  The wrath that this observation is obviously intended to provoke is justified, as is the bitterness summoned by Bugliosi's close reading of the justices' opinions, even if anyone who's read the opinions can see the logical and legal poverty of the majority opinion, including the numerous conservative law professors who have decried it.<br />What is both unjustifed AND unhelpful in advancing any sort of dialogue about this unsavory episode in our nation's recent history, is Bugliosi's repeated ad hominem disparaging of the targets of his critique.  Bugliosi incessantly refers to the SC justices as spineless, unprincipled, and worse, and in one very telling moment, in which he &quot;re-creates&quot; a possible conversation between O'Connor, Scalia, Rehnquist, Kennedy and Thomas in an attempt to explain their inexplicable flip-flop on whether this was a federal issue, what began as an astutely argued legal piece devolves into comic satire, like Al Franken but not as smooth.<br />All of this--the strident tone, the humorous punches--makes for entertaining reading, but it has some catastrophic drawbacks.  First, it distracts from Bugliosi's legitimate argumentation.  Second, and more important, it ensures that none but those who agree with Bugliosi will finish this book.  For his attack ends up extending beyond the SC and begins to target as well those who ever condescended to agree with (or even just uncritically accept) the Court's poorly reached decision.  The people who most need to read this book are, in my opinion, those who actually believe that Bush won 2000.  Bugliosi dismisses the conservative justices in a tirade such as even Charles Manson was never the subject of in &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot; and this just guarantees that those most in need will not bother to wade through insults en route to substance.  And who can blame them, when Bugliosi sounds in tone here like a more intelligent Rush Limbaugh?<br />Finally, this book is poorly organized.  (The editors' preface reminds us, as if begging our indulgence, that Bugliosi was under deadline pressure for another project, but, of course, if they'd waited on this one we all know they wouldn't have sold as many copies of it.)  Instead of incorporating more fleshed-out argumentation and amplifications INTO the extant text of the now-infamous Nation article that catalyzed this whole project, Bugliosi adds a series of torturously long and often meandering endnotes.  Not only do these endnotes take us from the flow of his argument, but they repeat themselves consistently, as if the author had forgotten points that had already been made.  That kind of sloppiness is unnecessary.<br />If you were incensed at the SC's verdict, by all means, buy this book and--just like I did--nod your head at every great point Bugliosi makes.  But you'll have to admit, like I finally did, that the anger and the insults end up taking center stage, pushing the more crucial and needed fruits of Bugliosi's legal and logical expertise into the obscured wings of the debate.<br />And to those reviewers (like &quot;Avid Reader&quot; and others) who think Bugliosi simply wanted the Florida Supreme Court to pick the President, you have either misread or not read &quot;The Betrayal of America,&quot; because he covers this.  The Florida SC acted on sound legal ground, he argues, while the US SC did not.  Therein lies the difference and the titular &quot;betrayal.&quot;	2001-08-11

Wootton puts his (and others') knowledge of this masterpiece to good use, and his clarifications are invaluable, helping both to situate Voltaire's thought in the context of his own life and culture, and to resurrect some of the more historically specific humor that has, sadly, been bled away by the last two and a half centuries.  Why is it funny, for example, that Voltaire sends his naive protagonist first to the Bulgars?  Wootton tells you.<br />Second, the wealth of contextual material is great for enlarging the reader's understanding of the intellectual climate that Voltaire is critiquing.  The Leibniz summary chosen is a bit opaque (small bits of the \\"Theodicee\\" would have worked better towards explaining the basics of Leibniz, or at least Voltaire's merciless version of Leibniz), but the portions of Pope and the excerpts of Voltaire's correspondence are enlightening.<br />The translation is, by and large, very good.  We lose a little humor (which always happens in translation), as when the baron's wife is said, due to her weight, to be \\"regarded as a person of substance\\" (2); Voltaire here says that, due to her weight, she \\"s'attirait par là une très grande considération [attracted great consideration],\\" a wee comical nod to Newtonian physics that must be seen as the first scientific pun of many to come.<br />This is minor, but another moment of the translation gives me great pause, and, judging from Wootton's impassioned introductory defense of his decision, it must have given him greater pause.  Most translations of \\"Candide\\" have reliably rendered the famous final lines as \\"we must cultivate our garden,\\" or something to that effect.  Very few have dared omit the word \\"garden.\\"  Wootton delivers it as \\"we must work our land,\\" and he defends his choice with a well-reasoned appeal to Voltaire's cultural context and correspondence, and claims further that the great symbolic appeal of the \\"Garden of Eden\\" image was largely behind the traditional rendering of the line as \\"we must cultivate our garden.\\"  The problem with his defense is not just that Voltaire's line bluntly (and literally) reads \\"il faut cultiver notre jardin [we must cultivate our garden],\\" but that the Garden of Eden resonance of which Wootton is so wary is not imported by the reader but rather quite present in \\"Candide,\\" and even in Wootton's translation of \\"Candide.\\"  When, on page 3 of this translation, Candide is \\"driven out of the Garden of Eden,\\" he begins a motion that will eventually cycle him back, older and wiser, to a different garden, one drained of religious specificity but not resonance.  By tampering with Voltaire's last line, Wootton's translation robs the narrative of its aggressive insistence on this return.<br />This is fairly nit-picky stuff, though, and any reader can keep the translation difficulties squarely in mind, since Wootton makes--to his credit--no attempt to conceal them.  So what you have, in the end, then, is a largely faithful and superbly readable rendition of a work that does not fail, to this day, to make us think, laugh, and feel ashamed.  Unpalatable social insitutions like slavery fall under Voltaire's sharp attack, as does the particular cruelty of which organized religion has shown itself capable.  The guileless protagonist is back in vogue (see the tributes to Candide in Boyle's \\"Tortilla Curtain\\" and Groom's \\"Forrest Gump\\"), as candid as ever.  For [the price], that's a lot of bang for your buck.	2001-06-27

Richter's book is absolutely indispensable, as it is one of the few anthologies willing to acknowledge the existence of and include well-chosen examples from the long history of critical thought and how it helps us understand what we read, why we read, and what we value.<br />You could buy the Adams/Searle two-volume deal, split into critical theory before and after 1965, but you'll notice right away that the date they've arbitrarily chosen as their critical divide doesn't hold water.  In order to introduce the post-1965 thinkers, Searle and Adams are forced to include a bevy of far earlier thinkers, from Heidegger to Lukacs to Wittgenstein.  You're safer to stick with Richter, who lets the interconnectedness of these thinkers speak for itself.<br />The greatest strength of Richter's tome is that it simply starts at the beginning (which is, as Julie Andrews reminds us, a &quot;very good place to start&quot;) and moves forward (until about the mid-19th century, when things get trickier), charting a course through what is aptly termed &quot;the critical tradition.&quot;  This movement provides an astonishingly broad context in which one can more usefully engage more contemporary thinkers.  Present-day debates over representation, for example, and the dangers thereof, weigh a great deal more when one is familiar with the long history that underpins this debate, from Aristotle to Horace (&quot;just representations of general nature&quot;) to Sidney, etc.<br />An unexpected bonus to this focus on thinkers other than those 20th-century bastions of critical theory, is a broader understanding of intellectual currents in other periods.  Romanticism?  You've got Kant, Shelley, Keats and Coleridge explaining it to you.  The Enlightenment?  You've got Johnson, Hume and Pope.  The more context one has, the more one understands, in my experience.<br />I've harped on the critical tradition in Richter, but he has chosen the contemporary essays well, too.  They're selected and organized in such a way as to give a sense of a debate taking shape.  This not only helps the readings speak to each other more directly, but it also forces the reader to keep in mind that the critical tradition is never a finished product.  Its construction continues, and by the end of a semester spent in Richter's anthology, we become a part of this development, feel its workings around and beyond us.<br />I highly recommend this volume.	2001-06-26
US	50202496	R1YRO88F8CWR0T	067976397X	659658614	Corelli's Mandolin: A Novel	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An Unbelievably Fresh and Impressive Telling of an Old Tale	Deep down this is--let's face it--a pretty traditional, even orthodox premise, a story of forbidden love with some other incidents around it.  But de Bernieres' first gift is that he is able to tell the tale in such an inventive and unorthdox way.  His second gift, a more important one, is an attention to detail so great that it turns a love story into a sweeping epic.  &quot;Corelli's Mandolin&quot; has impressed me more than any book I've read in the last six months.<br />The outset of the novel is disarming, as the chapters shift perspective faster than a spinning camera.  Without blatantly identifying the narrators of these chapters, de Bernieres still offers enough to hook the reader, and ultimately enough to alert us to the identity of the speaker, whether it be a gay Italian soldier of Herculean size and strength or an aging Greek physician writing his island's long history.  As these characters begin to reappear with a certain degree of frequency, we become familiar with their voices and their worlds, and the narrative acquires a rhythm that it retains and on which it builds for the rest of the novel.<br />My one criticism is small and applies only to a few moments of the novel.  De Bernieres seems occasionally not to have the greatest faith in the intelligence and attention of his readers, and he goes a little further to explain things than he need go.  Carlo's and Francesco's assault on their own Italian soldiers while wearing Greek uniforms is clearly an attempt at military provocation, a justification for an Italian invasion of Greece. There's no need here for de Bernieres to have Francesco say, &quot;It looks as though some stupid bastard wants to provoke a little war with Greece.&quot;<br />Those are tiny islets of attenuated subtlety, though, in what is otherwise a wonderfully understated narration.  De Bernieres has an ear sympathetic to all sorts of human hearts, and this allows him to flesh out even the most disparate and typically instantly unlikable characters (like a Nazi officer, for example).  When reading &quot;Corelli's Mandolin,&quot; I found myself wincing at the more wrongheaded choices made by some characters.  It is a testament to the author's strength, however, that I winced not because the choice made was wrong, but rather because I knew that the character making the wrong choice was capable of so much more, and so much better.<br />De Bernieres' novel is a patient one that starts subtly and gains momentum with each page.  It is also a novel of intense emotional highs and lows, every one of them well-earned.  It's been a long time since I balked at finishing a book simply because I didn't want it to end, but &quot;Corelli's Mandolin&quot; is that kind of book.	2001-06-11
US	50202496	R2BUMJYIEV84KG	0141000198	738261988	Bridget Jones's Diary	Books	4	23	24	N	N	A Quick, Fun, Hilariously Enjoyable Read!	I was sort of dragged to see this film the night it came out, but I ended up enjoying it immensely.  Of course, I had to buy the book next, and it kept me company on a long cross-country flight.  With all the humor of Nick Hornby, the self-deprecation of Woody Allen, and a plot borrowed from a classic, Fielding's narrative moves quickly and surely; always funny and ever-endearing, Bridget Jones's attempts to move from insecure singleness make for an engaging and hilarious read.<br />The humor of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; is its strongest quality.  From the exchange between Bridget and her boss, Daniel, regarding the absence-due-to-sick-leave of Bridget's apparently too-short skirt, to the Tarts and Vicars fiasco, there's a lot to laugh at in this book. Fielding does funny well, but she's also good for a pithy rejoinder in the Cruelty Department; the American woman Bridget catches her man Daniel with says, as Bridget is leaving, &quot;I thought you said she was thin.&quot;  Ouch.<br />Some of the reviews here have bashed &quot;Bridget&quot; for ripping off Austen, which is a little unfair.  Rewrites like this are nothing new--see Jean Rhys' &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; which updates &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; or David Lodge's &quot;Nice Work,&quot; which does ditto for Gaskell's &quot;North and South,&quot; or Peter Carey's &quot;Jack Maggs,&quot; a skewed perspective on &quot;Great Expectations.&quot;  Fielding's contribution to this growing genre (the nineteenth-century rewrite) is more openly self-aware than some, and she allows herself and Bridget to have an awful lot of fun with &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; even pointing comically to other versions of this classic, like the BBC series.  I don't see this in the least as a detractor from one's enjoyment of &quot;Bridget Jones.&quot;<br />The one thing that does detract, for me, is the incessant inclusion, at the outset of every chapter, of updated data on Bridget's running battle with her weight and waistline.  There are occasional comic variations on the theme, but I felt, for the most part, that they were a distraction that I soon came to disregard.  Unlike the recipes that commence every chapter of Laura Esquivel's &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; and have significant symbolic resonance throughout the chapter they introduce, Fielding's chapter-epigraphs in lbs. and calories don't seem to add much to the ongoing story.  (What's interesting is that Fielding apparently noticed this while writing the screenplay; in the film, she leaves them out after about the first five minutes, realizing that it was a trick that gets old fast.)  But that's not much to complain about.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book for its humor alone.  However, add to that comedy a fairly well-crafted plot that pokes fun at a classic while yet paying it homage and bringing it up to date, and you've got a great, fun read.  I totally enjoyed &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; and hope to read the sequel soon.	2001-06-10
US	50202496	RL345HKFGWPSF	077109857X	240995574	Garden in the Wind (New Canadian Library)	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Wonderful Introduction to Gabrielle Roy's Work	This small collection of four pieces of short fiction (ranging from a short-story-like 10 pages to an almost novella-length 50) is an excellent introduction to the work of Gabrielle Roy, one of the most important figures in Canadian and French-Canadian literature of the 20th century.  Against an often stark natural backdrop, Roy imbues her very human stories with enough warmth to get you through a winter in the Yukon.<br />What has always amazed and impressed me most about Roy is her ability to successfully maintain a tension, in her fiction, between the fact that her characters are so often uprooted or rootless and the fact that they have, despite this, a real sense of and feel for (and even love for) their setting.  Immigrants, vagabonds, and wanderers all move restlessly across Roy's Canada, unable or unwilling to settle, and usually searching for some unobtainable rest.  From different perspectives, Roy traces their wanderings with care and grace, and genuine sympathy.<br />My favorite piece here is &quot;Where Will You Go, Sam Lee Wong?&quot;, which focusses on a recent Chinese immigrant to the Great White North, and narrates his difficulties planting himself and thriving in the harsh ground of his newly chosen world.  A close second is &quot;Hoodoo Valley,&quot; a brief glimpse of an entire community of new arrivals from Eastern Europe in search of a place in Canada that reminds them of their former home.<br />Bookending these two immigrant narratives are the first and final stories, including the title piece, which closes the book out in a beautiful way.  The French title of the story (and thus of the collection) is &quot;A Garden at the Edge of the World,&quot; which captures a little more bluntly what Roy does in this flourishing finish.  In what is here called &quot;A Garden in the Wind,&quot; Roy situates us at the border--recognizable but not absolute or permanent in any way--between the mapped and known and habitable and controllable Canada, and the endless sprawls of naked land that fan out in almost every direction.<br />In a strange way, then, Roy manages to make her Canada (she's from Manitoba) imaginable simultaneously as a center or final destination AND as the very marginal threshold of what is known.  It's this willful and well-managed blend of opposites--of lovability and unlivability--that makes Roy's fiction such an interesting, moving and edifying read.	2001-04-12
US	50202496	R1I5Q8H6SYRKQE	0486266826	393870158	The Cherry Orchard	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Pretty good translation of a powerful play	People in my line of work (that is, teachers and critics of literature) seem to be paying more attention to &quot;The Sea Gull&quot; these days, but my money is still on &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; as favorite Chekhov play.  Dover's incomparably priced edition lacks a little in the readability of the translation, but it's still a nice version of a powerful piece of work.<br />For me, the real strength of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is its unwillingness to come down propagandistically on one side of any issue.  The intellectual and eternal student Trophimof levels a critique against capitalism, but one must bear in mind that it is capitalism that engineers the upward rise of the erstwhile peasant (and now landowner) Lopakhin (and, in the context of this play's being labeled a &quot;comedy,&quot; I think Chekhov codes this rise as a conditionally good thing).  Trophimof in fact seems to be granted a great deal of authority by the play, as he complains about the lazy intelligentsia and the useless aristocracy, but, sure enough, not wanting to make things too simple or simplistic, Chekhov has Madame Ranevsky put him in his place.  If this is a commentary on turn-of-the-century Russian society and politics (and I think we must read it as such), it is a very balanced, multi-perspectival and complex one.<br />Even the criticism of the play's upper classes--the focus on Gayef's irrational obsession with billiards or Pishtchik's naive assumption that, when he is in the deepest of financial troubles, something will always come along to bail him out--is delicately balanced against the workaholic insensitivity of Lopakhin, who leaves Varya Ranevsky stranded at the play's end and expecting a proposal of marriage from him that is hinted at but never comes.  What Chekhov seems to be supporting is not, perhaps, Trophimof's over-intellectualized and propaganda-like insistence on work, or Lopakhin's materialistic actual obsession with work, but maybe a revaluation of the priorities that have led to social divisions and the problematic reactions to them.<br />One crucial translation hitch appears early on, as Gayef passionately addresses a cupboard and praises it for holding, for so many years, wisdom and knowledge and the keys to social betterment.  All other translations I have consulted have rendered this &quot;cupboard&quot; as a &quot;bookshelf,&quot; and, to be honest, that makes a lot more sense, in context.  Other issues of readability (or the slight lack thereof) in this Dover edition are best seen in comparison to Hingley's imminently readable and enjoyable Oxford UP translation and edition, which, to my mind, remains the standard.  This Dover edition's dialogue is occasionally stilted and impenetrable.<br />Still, though, for the price, this copy of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; is unbeatable.  It's an impressive and provocative play, and even more so when one is reminded of its original context.  It's problematic, of course, to pin events to each other and argue for direct influence, but I have a hard time seeing the workers' uprisings in Russia during the winter of 1905-06 as completely unrelated from this play's release in 1904, which set many of these still vital issues into motion in a very productive way.	2001-04-07
US	50202496	R1JLRNHX7JL860	014002865X	374194443	Stepping Westward	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Mis-Stepping Westward	If I could give this 3.5 stars, I would.  Bradbury's &quot;Stepping Westward&quot; strings together many comic scenes--some of them cheesy, but some downright hilarious--and takes a satirical westward stab at American campus politics at the outset of the sexual revolution; however, there never seems to be enough tension scraped together to congeal into a viable, inviting plot.<br />Englishman James Walker, a struggling writer, is invited to Benedict Arnold University, in the American town of Party (oh, the hilarity of invented names), to be writer-in-residence for the year.  He accepts the offer and moves to the States, where the English department is peopled with all brands of stereotypical American academics, from tight-collared traditionalists to spouse-swapping wannabe radicals.  Comedy ensues.<br />There is a great deal of situational humor in this book, largely of the fish-out-of-water, culture-shock variety, with America representing the free-wheeling bedlam and Walker the congenitally repressed Brit, but it's simply not enough to drive the novel to its end, and the later chapters drag.  When, at the story's close, Walker boards his England-bound ship, it is quite unclear whether the book's events will leave any lasting impression on him, or on the novel's reader.<br />As an American academic, I appreciated much of the humor in &quot;Stepping Westward,&quot; and found myself nodding my head in agreement, even at some of the sillier moments.  If you have an interest in these sorts of academic gags (like the novels of David Lodge, for example), then I'm guessing you'll enjoy this book (if and when it comes back into print).  If not, I really wouldn't recommend it too strongly.	2001-03-28

In one volume, Kintz goes a long way, I think, toward advancing the possibility of mutual discussion between Right and Left.  Those on the Left, she argues, need to quit dismissing and laughing at what appears to be irrationality, cheesiness, and seductive sermonics; to understand the resurgence of the Right, one must get to the heart of exactly how powerful emotions are--emotions which, Kintz argues, are neither wholly rational nor irrational--in its recent success.<br />Rather than predictably pin American religious and political conservatism on absolutist and narrow-minded interpretations of the (politically instrumentalized) Bible and thus of natural law, Kintz examines the dynamic interaction between such absolutism and the construction of gender roles in the American conservative family structure.  This proves a very productive strategy, and enables her to offer astute readings of issues such as gun proliferation (which she links to a wounded masculine pride and budding national fear nascent in the post-Vietnam years) and the pro-life movement (which stems, she claims, from the very fixed role assigned to the power of reproduction in the religious right's imagining of the family).<br />While reading &quot;Between Jesus and the Market,&quot; I almost wished that Kintz had gone to greater lengths to interpret her material rather than provide extensive rehearsals of it, rich with quotes.  But then I had to remember that the ground Kintz is covering--publications by right-wing think tanks and pundits--is so new for most of her (presumably left-wing-academic) readers, that the play-by-play really is, ultimately, useful for drawing liberal skeptics into the conservative world she is attempting to read.  The reader who has an immediate and unpleasant visceral reaction at the name &quot;Rush Limbaugh&quot; will have a much more informed reaction after encountering large chunks of his actual words in Kintz' fine book.  Thus, the prolonged engagement with the texts serves a powerful purpose, and Kintz is right to have recognized this.<br />Implicit in this entire study is a sharp criticism of the Left.  That there is little or no dialogue between conservatives and liberals in America is tragic, Kintz admits, but she quite rightly seems to insist that, if anything is to move forward, we on the acadmeic left must take it upon ourselves to emerge from the safety of our intellectual irony in an effort to understand the Right, and then to bridge the gap.   As the only &quot;liberal&quot; in an immediate family that is almost entirely of the conservative bent that Kintz describes, I came away from this book with something even more valuable.  Kintz has put the finger on exactly what my difficulty is in understanding where my parents come from--my parents, who, while among the most compassionate people I know, went door-to-door recently at the request of their church, helping to drum up votes in favor of an anti-gay initiative on the California ballots.  &quot;What kind of powerful rhetoric,&quot; Kintz asks, &quot;can call itself love without recognizing that its effects are the same as if it called itself hatred?&quot; (29)  The sooner we can answer that question, the better off we'll all be.	2001-03-26

Well, the risk paid off.  I've read dozens of books on writing, and especially on the craft of creative writing, and I think that King's efforts strike the perfect balance between knowledgeable, literate advice and a crash course in the very practical concerns that can make or break a writer.<br />What shines brightest for me, in &quot;On Writing,&quot; is the very serious treatment of the craft as hard labor.  King makes no bones about the sheer determination and effort that the task requires, and readers will come away with a better sense of whether they themselves feel up to it.  Part of this attention to the work behind the works involves the act of careful re-writing, and here King's advice is also invaluable.  He points out common trouble spots--and often, in a very un-self-conscious manner, points them out in his own writing--for writers: overused adverbs, unnecessary description and narration, etc.  Beginning writers as well as seasoned veterans can, if they follow King's advice, make their prose more economical and capable of greater immediate punch.<br />And then there's the moving section on his accident, and how writing ultimately helped him to move beyond it.  It's a perfect ending to a beautiful and timely book--often deeply personal, often collegially frank yet encouraging--on what I believe to be the most important craft.	2001-03-24
US	50202496	R2RRT00VCW6RGE	0226505413	293347457	God Without Being: Hors-Texte (Religion and Postmodernism)	Books	5	70	71	N	N	&quot;If 'God is love,' then God loves before being.&quot;	Let me admit first off that Marion's &quot;God Without Being&quot; is a difficult read; I admit this despite the fact that, when I first read it, my brain was well steeped in the work of Derrida, Heidegger, Levinas, and many others into and out of whose discourses Marion constructs his own argument.  There are large chunks of the essay that still puzzle me, but the clarity of the ultimate movements will not be lost on the attentive reader.  Theology is wasting its time, Marion claims, when it appears primarily as apologist for an existing God, for the most important thing about God is not first that God lives, but that God gives.<br />Beginning with an interrogation of what he will later term &quot;the ontological impediment&quot; (this very pre-occupation with systematizing or explaining God's being or God-as-Being), Marion contests that this very focus on ex-planation (with its aggressively outbound prefix) prevents one from being capable of acting as receiver (with all its quietly centripetal connotations) and thus betrays one of the most basic theological aims: speaking of &quot;the gift that Christ makes of his body,&quot; Marion reminds us that &quot;a gift, and this one above all, does not require first that one explain it, but indeed that one receive it&quot; (162).<br />The book's back cover refers to this move as one that resituates God in the realm of agape, or Christian charity, rather than in the realm of Being.  Marion does indeed speak of agape, but I think that the tidy and perhaps overly theoretical ring of the word would give way, if he had his preference, to the plain, everyday notion of &quot;giving&quot; to which he turns at the most powerful moments of &quot;God Without Being.&quot;  Because for Marion the gift of Christ is already a very physical fact (&quot;in a word,&quot; he says, &quot;the Resurrection remains historically verifiable&quot; [193]), the messy physicality of giving seems to me truer to his reinscription of God than does the theological purity of agape.<br />The deeply Catholic background of Marion's work, while not in the least a detractor, may make the book slightly less accessible for those not familiar with many tenets of or ongoing debates within the Catholic theological tradition; this was certainly a difficulty for me, but not an insoluble one.  And the framing of the essay as a working out of one's own faith, from the &quot;Envoi&quot; to &quot;The Last Rigor,&quot; allows the impact of Marion's address to operate perfectly coherently on a logical level, but even more so on an individually emotional level.<br />Readers interested in theology and postmodern recontextuatlizations of it--and even, perhaps, in the reconciliation of these two terms--will find in Marion's &quot;God Without Being&quot; a very satisfying if not moving experience.	2001-03-24

No, Follett's not Faulkner, and you'll get no musings on the human condition.  But that's not why one reads Follett; you read Follett for the tightly written, superbly constructed thriller, and, in &quot;Lie Down With Lions,&quot; that's exactly what you get.<br />The action is intense, right from the outset, where American agent Ellis blows his cover in Paris, losing in the process his girlfriend Jane, who takes up with another guy and heads with him to Afghanistan, to offer medical assistance to a populace wearied by war against the invading Soviets (sort of a 1980s version of Médecins sans frontières).  Ellis tails her there, under the auspices of the US government, to train the Afghan fighters.  At which point, the plot thickens, and doesn't let up till the very end.<br />The dynamics of the Ellis/Jane relationship are great, very natural and well drawn in a way one doesn't usually find such relationships drawn in action novels.  Their moments of greatest intimacy--including an amazingly and erotically written love scene that rivals anything in Miller or Joyce--help drive one of the novel's main tensions, a tension between the reader's responses to these two characters who are often at odds but both very sympathetic.  This tension, though, merely underscores the real, action-based tension surrounding the military skirmishes taking place on the greater stage outside the Ellis/Jane relationship.<br />As some reviewers have pointed out, &quot;Lie Down With Lions&quot; isn't much use as a history primer on the war in Afghanistan, or as a probing meditation on the nature of existence.  But that's really beside the point.  We read Follett, like we read Clancy and Grisham, because they're amazingly talented story tellers with interesting stories to tell.  I've read &quot;Lie Down With Lions&quot; three times and enjoyed it immensely each time.	2001-03-16

Annoyingly, both of the reviews already posted on this page for the &quot;Collected Stories&quot; of Welsh writer Leslie Norris refer to the &quot;Collected Stories&quot; of Welsh writer Dylan Thomas, which Leslie Norris designed but did not (obviously) write.  This review, then, is an actual review of Leslie Norris' &quot;Collected Stories&quot;!<br />Leslie Norris's collected stories are a sort of bittersweet beauty very much in the Joycean tradition (think especially of &quot;Dubliners&quot;).  They begin with some sort of pivotal moment at which confusion either enters into or peaks in the protagonist's young life, and they end with an epiphany that seems sweetly to keep the bitter at bay, but knows that the respite is at best only temporary.<br />Also a poet (see his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; as well), like fellow Welshman Thomas, Norris's language is simple but fresh, and sumptuous when necessary, a prose tone perfectly in step with the state of his protagonists.  Often (if not always), they are young boys on the brink of a knowledge that will disillusion them and send them closer to the concerns of adulthood.<br />In &quot;Sliding,&quot; an accident during an afternoon of sliding across a frozen pond upsets a group of boys, their first initiation into the idea of impermanence.  In &quot;Kingfisher,&quot; a boy, who has just been with his father to visit his dying grandmother, sees in the garden the dead body of a bird that he and his father had only that morning watched together; in a moment of suddenly adult consciousness, he takes it upon himself to conceal the bad news of mortality from his father.  In &quot;Shaving,&quot; one of my faves from the collection, an athlete in the full strength of youth returns triumphant from the rugby field to shave his ailing father, who, in the full fading of disease, is too weak to shave himself.<br />This volume collects Norris's previous two (unfortunately long out-of-print) books, &quot;Sliding&quot; and &quot;The Girl from Cardigan,&quot; putting them together with a few new stories in book form for the first time.<br />Norris excels at awakening emotion, but is subtle enough and careful enough not to hit you over the head with the hammer of sentimentality.  If you appreciate and enjoy fiction that looks at those moments that we all know, where we begin to feel ourselves a part of the knowledge that life ends up teaching everyone sooner or later, then this book is a terrific buy.	2001-03-10

The director is berated by a chorus of academics for his documentary-style authoritarianism in his approach to representing the story of Oskar Schindler and the Schindler Jews.  What merits the movie does have are, by and large, swept under the carpet in the interest of pointing out its glaring faults and moments of irresponsible over-reaching.  This robs the debate of a good measure of balance, but the wealth of different critical perspectives brought to bear on the discussion more than makes up for any lack of diplomacy.<br />The book's greatest stengths are just this sort of breadth--there are essays here by film experts, historians, literary theorists and other academic luminaries, most notably Geoffrey Hartmann and Omer Bartov.  Another virtue of Loshitzky's collection is that the reader comes away with a much better grasp of the larger debate over representing the Holocaust.  Essays point repeatedly to Claude Lanzmann's interview-style documentary as an ideal form, but the more careful essays admit that this is not the version most viewers would sit through, as it's too long, too slow, etc.<br />There are some shocking revelations, too, like things Spielberg has said in interviews that should curdle the blood of even his most vociferous supporters.  He compares his trials of being rich and famous and recognizable with the suffering of victims of the Holocaust, and one wonders what on earth he could possibly have been thinking.<br />Those tidbits aside, though, the most useful, convincing and durable essay here is, in my opinion, the balanced assessment by Bartov, a Holocaust historian, who candidly admits that Spielberg's triumphalism and hero-narrative are terribly misplaced in this corner of history.  Unlike the other essayists here, though, Bartov challenges critics to focus more on the positive accomplishments of the film,and especially the fact that it has raised overall awareness of the tragedy in extraordinary fashion.  This must not be forgotten in a judgment of the film, he argues, since it is likely (and he writes this, of course, before the breakout success of Benigni's &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;) the only Holocaust film most people--and certainly most Americans--will ever care to see.<br />While certain of the pieces cater more obviously to an academic crowd well versed in the ongoing debate and most current scholarship on the topic of the Holocaust, the book in general is quite accessible to more mainstream audiences who wish to see Spielberg's version of the Shoah challenged in an often very productive way.  I highly recommend this book.	2001-03-08

His rescuer is, of course, the man who wants the old curmudgeon's daughter's hand in marriage, and they make up and all's well.  &quot;The Girl from Samos&quot; is funnier, with a baby mix-up that leads first to the normal questions of the father's identity, but then to far less normal questions about the mother's identity.<br />Miller's introduction is exceptional, and I was especially appreciative of it, since I am not a classicist.  She provides enough background to initiate even the casual reader, and in a manner that is both humorous and accessible.  She explains what can be explained and accounted for, and freely admits to what is pure conjecture; since Menander's plays survive only in fragments, and since we don't know all of the concrete facts of his life, Miller's candor is welcome and helpful.<br />The only thing I found off-putting was the translation.  It is not only VERY contemporary, but VERY British.  While I can understand the urge to place things in a more familiar setting--an easy way to remind people that great drama is always timely--some of the dialogue sounds lifted from &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; or even &quot;Goodbye Mr. Chips.&quot;  That is, it sounds very early twentieth century British, and I spent a lot of time while reading trying to figure out why (I'm still stumped).  Phrases such as &quot;There's a good chap,&quot; and explicit references to &quot;Picadilly Circus&quot; just didn't seem to mesh with plays that are Greek and a couple thousand years old.<br />Still, you could a lot worse than spend $12 on a fine collection and very readable rendition of some of the very foundations of comic form in Western literature.	2001-03-04

If you haven't read Montaigne, you have to read him.  Hell, he invented the essay.  That's not at issue here.  Which edition you choose, though, is.  In general, I'm a big fan of the Dover Thrift Editions.  They cover many classics of the canon, with competent if mildly antiquated translations, and--best of all--they're dirt cheap.<br />This short edition, a tiny selection of the essays of Michel de Montaigne, has many virtues, not the least of which is editor Philip Smith's excellent contribution in footnotes at the bottom of each page.  Smith points to problems in the translation, updating it where necessary and remedying Montaigne's penchant for sprinkling Latin quotes here and there; all the Latin passages are translated and traced to their origins.<br />In addition, this volume does contain a couple of Montaigne's most durable essays, especially &quot;Of Friendship&quot; and &quot;Of Repentance.&quot;  Some choice ones are noticeably absent, though, and in particular Montaigne's hard look at the practice of colonizing the then-New World.  Essays like &quot;Of Cannibals&quot; and &quot;Of Coaches,&quot; which use an examination of native American cultures in order to critique the culture of Montaigne's own France, are far more popular (if not indispensible) today than they were in 1877, when the essays in this selection were originally chosen and translated.  Those omissions, more than anything else, leave this Dover Edition feeling substantially dated and disappointingly incomplete.<br />Dover Editions are usually the best buy around, but for Montaigne's Essays, it's worth your while to spring for a more complete selection.	2001-02-24

They're not just in different ballparks, but they play different games.  Clancy's job is to tell a good story and make things simple; he does it well, and I'm a fan.  Perec's job, however, is to make sure his reader knows exactly how difficult things really are.  This goes doubly for an approach to one of the most difficult historical moments of the recent past, the Holocaust.  Perec's &quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; embodies all of the violence of this historical tragedy and of memories of such tragedy.<br />There are two narrative threads running through this book, touching each other occasionally in a manner that illuminates both in strange and arresting ways.  Half of the chapters are &quot;W,&quot; the fictional account of a man, Gaspard Winckler, who has survived a war by adopting the identity of a parapalegic (the real Gaspard Winckler) who later dies in a shipwreck off the Tierra del Fuego.  Prodded by the mysterious Otto Apfelstahl, the living Gaspard embarks on a journey to recover his memory of the real Gaspard, to discover who he was and how he died.  This journey becomes, in the second half of &quot;W,&quot; a description in coldly anthropological terms of a seemingly totalitarian island-state, in which citizens are forced to compete in brutal and naked athletic games for things like food and the right to procreate--the basics of human life.<br />The other half of the chapters are Perec's own autobiographical contributions, beginning, despite the promising title of the book, with the admission, &quot;I have no memory of childhood.&quot;  Perec's voice sifts through his rubbled past--his father's death in the French Army, his mother's transportation to Auschwitz, his being concealed in a Catholic school and raised by his relatives--and attempts to separate what he remembers from what he has been taught to remember through photos, language,etc.  His reflections are marked with a humor that is endearing in light of his horrifying experiences, and with a subtlety that is astounding in light of the atrocities to which the text must bear remote witness.<br />The two narratives, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;The Memory of Childhood,&quot; weave around each other like ivy, finally becoming, in a stunning and climactic final chapter, part and parcel of one story.  Perec's ultimate fusion of his willful fictions and his awe-full remembrances is powerful and well-presaged; the entire universe of the book builds beautifully and disturbingly toward this final moment, as the fictions become more like fact and the autobiography occupies itself increasingly with fictions.<br />Bellos' translation is superb, even if one does lose some of the very productive puns of the original (the moment early on, for example, when &quot;l'Histoire avec sa grande hache&quot; should make us think simultaneously of History with a capital H and History with its big axe; Bellos sticks with the capital H rendering of the phrase).<br />So, no, &quot;W or the Memory of Childhood&quot; is not Tom Clancy.  But it doesn't mean to be, and it doesn't need to be.  What it is, instead, is a sobering, touching, daunting and disturbing reminder of some of the worst our century has had to offer.  If you are interested in a writer who is unashamed of standing heroically baffled and gaping in the face of immeasurable atrocity, buy and read this book.	2001-02-24

Rilke's &quot;Duino Elegies&quot; form one of the most perfect collections of lyric poetry you can ever hope to get your hands on.  Unfortunately for the David Young translation, however, there is much less Rilke than there ought to be; a series of strange decisions on Young's part casts a shadow over even the brighter moments of his rendering of this masterpiece.<br />For example, Rilke was a genius at enjambment; that is, he was a master at placing his most important words at the very end or very beginning of a line, in order to highlight them.  Think of the first line, which ends with &quot;Engel,&quot; splitting it from the first word of the next line, &quot;Ordnungen.&quot;  (Young merely gives these words together, as &quot;angelic orders,&quot; at the end of the third line.)  By divorcing the angels from their orders in the poem's very first line, Rilke sets the tone that not all is right in the heavens.<br />And Rilke's line breaks are even more important than those of other poets, because they are few and far between, since his lines are nice and fat, often more than 13 syllables.  Young's lines, on the other hand, are broken up into tiny 2- to 8-syllable, bite-sized chunks.  This changes not only the rhythm of Rilke's verse--which obviously would have changed anyway, in translation--but its compositional emphases, as the structure of the most important lines is simply whisked away.  And that is a tragedy.<br />Young's excuse for this unfortunate decision?  He happened, while he was working on the translation, &quot;to re-read some of William Carlos Williams' late poetry,&quot; and he liked Williams' stubbier, tri-partite lines.  Rilke, however, is not William Carlos Williams, and Young's rendering of Rilke as Williams suffers because of this incongruity.  (Oddly enough, though, Williams is another poet for whom every line break bears an awful lot of weight; too bad Young didn't carry that respect for enjambment into his work on the &quot;Duino Elegies.&quot;)<br />Those interested in Rilke should do themselves a favor and pick up Mitchell's translation.  I simply can't recommend this edition.  It gets three stars because, despite the muddle, there are SOME beautifully rendered lines, and some of the power of Rilke manages to squeeze through.  And that's always a wonderful thing.	2001-02-15

This book is a first-rate shortened version of Irish history.<br />At times, one thinks more and deeper connections could have been drawn (such as the resurrection, by twentieth century hunger-strikers, of Brehon Law-era practices like fasting for the redress of grievances) and more discussion fostered on particularly hard-hitting aspects of Ireland's past and present.  But this is, after all, a SHORT history, and a remarkable one at that.<br />There is good coverage of Ireland before the arrival of the English, in a way that touches on both historical developments and cultural ones.  Likewise, the era of Cromwell and the disastrous run-up to and aftermath of Black 1847 are given good detail.  One comes away feeling a bit as though more recent history (say, 1916 and on) has been slighted, but this feeling is probably just the product of years of weighted emphasis on the twentieth century; Ranelagh does well to bring a historical balance to the overall sweep of Ireland's development into what it is today.<br />And what it is today is, for Ranelagh, closely invested as well in the question of what England is and no longer is.  &quot;A Short History of Ireland&quot; may disturb those who view England as a still-unwelcome visitor into Irish history and culture, but Ranelagh concludes convincingly that the story of Ireland from the 13th century on is intimately related to its evolving relationship with its slightly larger neighbor and one-time persecutor/antagonist.  Ranelagh quite usefully and realistically departs from other histories of the Emerald Isle in asserting that the England/Ireland relationship can, for a slew of reasons that he points to, only ever be one of co-dependence.	2001-02-13

First off, I am a huge fan of Mark Eitzel and AMC, so that's not an issue.  I was excited to read this book because I was a late convert to the music and was looking forward to catching up on the story I'd missed behind the band I dug.  Body's culling together of reviews and interviews is admirable, and the depth of factual research in general is impressive.  Die-hard AMC/Eitzel fans aren't going to be able NOT to appreciate the concentration of information here.<br />My reservations about the book deal with the telling of the story; I really don't think there's much surprising or new in here.  Body insists that--and quotes others' insisting that--Eitzel is &quot;one of the greatest living songwriters,&quot; but he doesn't really try to test the whys and hows of this claim beyond uttering the normal platitudes about touching deep common emotional chords.  But every review of every AMC/Eitzel album has already told us that.<br />Slightly more off-putting was...how shall I call it?...a disturbing textual relationship between Body's work and some of his source material.  I'll cite one example.  As Body describes Eitzel's recorded solo show in 1991 (that ended up as &quot;Songs of Love Live&quot;), &quot;People called out for requests contantly, mouthed the words to songs, and generally revelled in what felt like a semi-religious event; part stand-up comedy, part theatre, part concert and part revivalist meeting&quot; (103).  Compare Andrew Smith's review of the concert, reprinted in the CD's liner notes: &quot;Tonight, the atmosphere in the Borderline was like a cross between a revivalist gospel service, an intimate jazz club and a pantomime.  People called for songs, mouthed the words, even commented on them between numbers...&quot;  What's going on here?  I understand that re-creating concerts one might not have attended could be a difficult proposition, but a little more gracious disclosure as to the origin of the description might be warranted in this case.  I'm almost afraid to look at the other reviews that might have been consulted in the writing of the book.<br />If you want the history of AMC, you'll get it.  The sound bites from Eitzel alone are practically worth the price of the book.  I was just a little disappointed, after finishing &quot;Wish the World Away,&quot; that a book about an artist so unafraid of picking at his own wounds seemed to pull up short of considering some of the harder questions in a fresh way.	2001-02-12

More emphasis could perhaps have been placed on poems whose formal constructions deviate (however subtly) from the rigidity of the norms, but that's just me being extra picky.<br />One thing I found a bit frustrating--perhaps because it was simultaneously enabling and inhibiting--was the manner in which she has cordoned all of the poems off into their own thematic categories.  I know that this serves the overall purpose of framing her discussion of ritual in the culture and the texts, but I think it brought about a certain narrowing of perspective in the reading of some poems.<br />All in all, though, a strongly recommended piece of reading for anyone interested in the development of poetic forms, and a potentially illuminating context for other poetry of the era, especially Old English texts like &quot;The Wanderer&quot; or &quot;The Seafarer.&quot;	2001-02-11

Henry Award pieces, &quot;Two Brothers&quot; and &quot;The Polygamy of Language&quot;).  Some of the stories don't catch hold as well as others, but overall, in bleak tones and economic prose, Evenson lays bare the damaging inter-relatedness of language, religion, and violence.<br />Several of the stories in &quot;Contagion&quot; have a darkly cultish feel to them: a preacher rewrites scripture and his children are unsure of how or whether to resist him; a madman discourses on the origin of language while going through a polygamists' camp.  Others have a somber and scientific pulse: in &quot;Internal,&quot; an interning research assistant begins to suspect that the subject of his observations may in turn be observing him, or that the line between observer/observed might not exist at all; in &quot;Watson's Boy,&quot; humans in (what the back cover tells us is) a conditioned response box vie against rats for survival.<br />For me, the highlight of the collection is the title story, &quot;Contagion.&quot;  As two hired hands walk a long stretch of barbed-wire fence, the clarity of their assigned mission--repair? report?--begins to fade, and they begin to distrust each other.  One of the men keeps a journal of their actions, until, the two men separated from each other, the whole thing begins to unravel.  At the story's end, one of the men is held captive in a room and forced to keep writing, until the clarity of the story itself begins to fade.<br />Evenson is able, in a short amount of time, to rig a perfectly normal story and then let it unravel as problems of language and fiction become thematized.  Shades of Kafka, Perec, maybe, or some of Handke's earlier work.  Often, fiction about fiction and language about language is just plain dull, but Evenson's compact, blunt prose won't allow that.<br />If you're interested in fiction that walks a little on the wild side, &quot;Contagion&quot; is a good buy.	2001-02-10
US	50202496	R3LL4HD5G42R8J	086091612X	221851833	Late Imperial Romance	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A significant and very readable redirection of po-co studies	McClure's &quot;Late Imperial Romance&quot; treats a crisis in western fiction that begins at the end of the nineteenth century.  In the wake of decades of non-stop empire-building and the attendant mapping of the world, all the unknown and uncharted nooks and crannies of the earth--the very zones of mystery that had, for years, powered the efforts of English novelists--have ultimately disappeared, victims of a secularizing process that Max Weber refers to as &quot;rationalization.&quot;  Late imperial romance, McClure argues, attempts to cope with this crisis in two ways, by either &quot;engineering a re-enchantment&quot; or an unmapping of the known world, or unearthing newer sites of the unknown (as in the borderless geopolitical networks of espionage).<br />McClure first covers writers like Kipling and Conrad, who articulate the pivotal transitional moment in this crisis, before he moves on to revealing and convincing readings of Kennedy's speeches and the fiction of Didion, Pynchon, and DeLillo.  All the way, the author's prose has a casual elegance and almost conversational readability, yet without sacrificing a bit of scholarly rigor.  McClure's treatments of the writers he examines are provocative and incisive, but the overall approach is perhaps even more significant.<br />Against the sort of ardently secularized criticism of imperialism and the post-imperial practiced by luminaries like Edward Said (and perhaps even Gayatri Spivak), McClure demonstrates that a re-evaluation of spiritual matters and their place in the discourse of late colonial post-colonial fiction can be strikingly revelatory, perhaps even more progressive.  Secular critics like Said (and, as McClure also mentions, Fredric Jameson) betray the causes of inclusiveness that they purport to support when they single-mindedly dismiss all things non-secular from their recommended vision of the world.  McClure clears space, in &quot;Late Imperial Romance,&quot; for a real inclusiveness, one capacious enough to defend &quot;the value of texts . . . that refuse to rehearse the funeral of the spirit.&quot;	2001-02-10

Fontane's inspiration for the novel was equal parts &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and the real-life Ardenne case, in which a respected military officer duelled against and defeated his unfaithful wife's lover.  Well crafted and thorough in its sketch of characters and environs, &quot;Effi Briest&quot; articulates tensions rampant in the late nineteenth century but still pertinent today.<br />Effi is still dangerously young when the older and accomplished Baron von Innstetten swoops into her mother's garden and marries her.  The couple settle in a distant port town, in a house that gives Effi the creeps to the point that she imagines she is being haunted by the ghost of a Chinese man who died in the town years before.  Innstetten, often away on government business, dismisses her fears, but the Major Crampas listens to her, and a liaison develops between him and Effi.  Years later, the affair ended, the Innstettens move to Berlin, and the Baron discovers the old letters of the Effi-Crampas correspondence by accident.  Without giving away the ending, there's a duel and a divorce and a death.<br />At the mere level of plot, there's plenty here to entertain, but there's much more to the novel than the headline story itself.  Fontane forces a look at the Prussian involvement in empire-building projects of the nineteenth century, as well as the debilitating effects of indiscriminate secularization; &quot;Effi Briest&quot; depicts a culture alternately hungry for and wary of romance and enchantment, caught between occasional fascination with the newer world and the comforts of burgeoning technology at home.<br />Douglas Parmée's translation is generally very good, capturing the somewhat informal but authoritative tone of the original.  There is one important translation hitch that bugs me, though: he renders the repeated image of the &quot;widefield,&quot; the &quot;zu weites Feld,&quot; as &quot;too big a subject,&quot; and, while this is certainly the connotation, its robs the reader of a little elasticity.<br />To a twenty-first century reader, &quot;Effi Briest&quot; will no doubt come across as a little schlocky and sentimental at times, but no more so than, say, Austen or Brontë.  If you enjoy the classics, I think this one endures pretty well.  It's a wonderful book, with characters you really get to know and love.	2001-02-10

I wish I could say that it showed a broad descriptive vocabulary for something other than genitalia; I wish I could say it demonstrated some sort of progression, some sort of upping the ante as the book progresses, but, except for one scene (in which the narrator first tries sodomy), it doesn't; finally, I wish I could say I finished reading it.  Wait, no I don't.  To be frank, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but I do think people should be aware of its existence.<br />As a memoir, it's single-minded: sex, sex, sex.  As erotica, it's poorly crafted.  But as a social document, it's incomparable.  In an era that covered the legs of pianos because they were deemed too suggestive, the narrator of &quot;My Secret Life&quot; seems to have sex with whomever he wants, whenever he wants, and wherever he wants.<br />There are plenty of examples of nineteenth century depravity, but the real value of this book is the way it shows, in pretty disturbing relief, the very class-based aspects of all this free love.  The escapades of Jennings, a well-to-do &quot;gentleman,&quot; are by and large facilitated (if not totally enabled) by his upper-class standing, by his social power, by the fact that those beneath him don't seem to have much choice.  So, one after the other, he has farm girls, maids, servants, prostitutes, etc., with seeming impunity.<br />One also learns that sexual practices this deviant were precisely NOT that deviant (which makes me want to show this book to anyone I meet who claims the world is on a moral slowdive; it's nothing new, folks, just ask Sade).  A certain shake of the head or movement of the eyes in the right part of town, the narrator assures us, was a clear-cut invitation to a nearby lady that you are ready to get a room somewhere.  I find this reserved openness--in the context of a very open reservedness about the sexual in Victorian culture--to be the greatest revelationof this book.<br />In essence, the morality under which we still pretend to live in the USA is a Victorian one, to the bone.  And 150 years ago, certain problems lurking beneath that moral facade were laid quite bare by James Jennings, who, perhaps in fitting tribute to the self-annointed moral crusaders of the day, cruised the streets in his double life, having as much secret sex as he could stomach.  And you can be certain that he voted Tory.	2001-02-10

Alter's running commentary in the footnotes (which constitute at least one half of every page!) alerts readers to centuries of interpretations and re-interpretations of this cornerstone of world literature, in a manner that makes the book of Genesis seem more alive and more vital than ever before, an ongoing and important discussion.<br />Alter's commentaries help to situate Genesis within the larger narrative arc of the Bible as well as they address even the most current strains of Biblical exegesis (like feminist rethinkings of gender roles in the creation, for example), but this reader found the wealth of fascinating minutiae even more endearing.  What did Potiphar's wife REALLY say to Joseph when she tried to seduce him?  It's in there.  What does Adam's name mean in Hebrew?  It's in there.<br />First-time readers of the Bible can expect a very readable yet faithful prose, while long-time readers can expect the unexpected, as Alter's etymological and socio-historical explanations bring a pleasantly surprising new clarity to a classic.	2001-02-10

Critique of the Sixties	I'll admit right off the bat that this is one of my favorite novels.  It's packed with more sly nods to American pop-culture of the last 8 decades than Dennis Miller could ever hope to cram into a whole week of Monday Night Football.  The prose is cumbersome and labyrinthine, but Pynchon rewards those with the patience to stick it out.  If you are willing to work your way through this dizzying journey to the heart of left-wing politics in America, there's a lot to be learned.<br />Like I said, Pynchon's style is really frustrating at times; clauses hang in places one wouldn't normally find them, long phrases get stuffed in parenthetical asides, and sentences--beautiful though they are--sprawl all over like lines of Whitman or Kerouac.  What we lose in ease, though, we make up for in depth.  The prose of &quot;Vineland&quot; almost forces you to slow down and savor it, and, given the wealth of historical and cultural moments to which Pynchon either pays subtle homage or deals a slight blow, you NEED to slow down.<br />This matter of style is directly related to the critique that Pynchon develops, through the course of the novel, of the Woodstock generation.  &quot;Vineland&quot; charts the counter-culture's successes and failures in a very fair way, and measures the 1960s against the larger tradition of radical politics in America dating back to the first-half of the twentieth century.<br />Rather than narrowmindedly berate the hippies for their rejection of traditional moralities (as a whole ugly slew of right-wing critics has done, from Michel Houellebecq to William Bennett and Rush Limbaugh), Pynchon's problems with sixties radicalism revolve around the gut-instinct, spur-of-the-moment flightiness of the era.  What was needed, the novel seems to suggest, was more thought and study, less immediate action, and a better understanding of the long term--all of which was total anathema to a generation hell-bent on living for the moment and equally convinced of the revolutionary potential in doing so.<br />Against this, the advice given to Prairie Wheeler (whose search for her lost mother sends us on this trans-generational and -historical thrill ride) to study the things she doesn't quite get, is good advice for anyone who wants to slog through this book.  Pynchon knows a hell of a lot of important stuff and he's not afraid to show it; however, obscure references should not be a reason to discard &quot;Vineland,&quot; but rather a reason to open an encyclopedia, to find out more about a sort of hidden history of the left half of the USA.<br />I've made the whole thing sound very dry and political, but there are other forces at play in &quot;Vineland&quot; that simply can't be categorized or explained: mysterious, Godzilla-like footprints that flatten buildings, for example, or ninja death-touches gone astray.  And this is to say nothing of the sheer humor of this book, which is off the charts from the outset, when an aging ex-hippie jumps through a plate-glass window to ensure that his government disability checks don't stop.<br />If you are interested in where the 1960s got us, where they didn't get us, and what we can learn from it all, or if you just want a demanding but rewarding and humorous read, then this book is a must.	2001-02-09

Grisham is not, in my opinion, a great writer--by which I mean his characters seem at times underdeveloped, and his use of the English language is often predictable and unenlightening--but he may be one of the best storytellers I've ever read.  &quot;The Firm&quot; is a masterfully plotted piece that moves along so fast you feel like you're being dragged, but not so fast that you feel you're being left behind and lost.  The intricacies of McDeere's efforts to steer himself and his wife out of the fine mess he's gotten them into at his new law firm are best illustrated by the terrible film made of Grisham's novel; a two-hour format was just woefully inadequate to chart the twists and turns of the narrative.  As a teller of tales, Grisham is much more than capable, and &quot;The Firm&quot; is probably his best.	2001-02-05

It contains some of Evenson's very best stories, especially the title short short, which turns a sudden double-homicide into a reflection on mortal power, who gets the authority to wield it, and what happens when we begin to speak the very language of those whose violent means we oppose.  For these reasons, and as its title suggests, it is useful key to many of the other stories.<br />Evenson's written style is remarkable, tightly bunched words and curt but beautifully suggestive sentences that make the prose at once alienating and very friendly.<br />Many of these pieces ground themselves explicitly or implicitly in attempts to understand or articulate specific historical tragedies such as the Holocaust.  They last long enough to open disturbing possibilities, then recede quickly and leave the reader to ponder the pieces.  No heroes, no solutions, nothing but the problems and the problems of communicating those problems.  In this, stories like &quot;Altmann's Tongue,&quot; &quot;Munich Window: A Persecution,&quot; &quot;Killing Cats,&quot; and others come much closer to the reality of the Holocaust and our need to remember it than dismissively heroic tales like Spielberg's &quot;Schindler's List&quot; can ever hope to do.	2001-02-05
US	50202496	R3KUP72NNNB6LV	014044131X	524015341	Tao Te Ching	Books	4	8	8	N	N	A perplexing but profitable read	I first encountered the Tao Te Ching in the Mithcell translation as a sophomore in college, and we read it--fitting the context of a course on world religions--as a religious text.  What is really nice about D. C. Lau's translation (and he mentions this in his fine intro) is that, in keeping with a longstanding tradition in Chinese culture, he attempts to restore some of the political import to the text.  Re-reading Lao Tzu's lyrical fragments in Lau's rendering of them really brought home to me an aspect of the text that is completely overshadowed, in most translations, by the religious angles that are important but not sole determiners of the Tao's relevance and message.  (This view sees me in disagreement with the avowed &quot;Taoist&quot; reviewer below who lamented Lau's attention to Lao Tzu's political import.)<br />While I heartily disagree with the political message of the Tao Te Ching--which sponsors a hands-off, laissez-faire, small-government formation, letting everything work itself out without intrusion from leaders and other well-intentioned officials, as if things ever just work themselves out on their own!--I appreciate Lau's efforts to recover in his translation a crucial, crucial aspect of Lao Tzu's thought, and one that has been shuffled under the magic carpet by Taoism's New Agey popularity among many Anglophones.	2001-02-05
US	50202496	R1JL6X9V89TPV5	0671880314	156284675	Schindler's List	Books	5	8	9	N	N	The Real Schindler's List	Keneally's approach to recreating history in &quot;Schindler's List&quot; is an intelligent and responsible one: he labels his representation exactly what it is, a fiction.  (Contrast this with Spielberg's pseudo-documentarian methods, which seem to want to claim some sort of absolute historical authority, in the film of the same name.)  Despite a wealth of historical minutiae culled from research and interviews with surviving &quot;Schindler Jews,&quot; Keneally is fully aware that his novel treads troubled and troubling ground; correspondingly, he is careful to alert his reader to the fact that he cannot faithfully reproduce human reality but will, rather, make every effort to get his story close.<br />Constructed like a well-plotted novel, &quot;Schindler's List&quot; sees Keneally's narrative powers at their finest.  His characters are full-bodied and believable, each with their own often very private motivations for their very public actions.  Keneally speculates on such motivations or contexts but does not pass judgment easily.  Most importantly, there is little of the handy black-and-white demonization of the Nazis that the film mobilizes to great rhetorical effect; while Spielberg's version forces one to take the uncomplicated side of Schindler and thus believe that he or she too would have done the right thing just like Oskar, Keneally allows a much more unsettling thought to percolate, one that is probably truer to life in insisting that, were we in the Nazis' shoes, we sadly and mistakenly would likely have done exactly what they did.  Keneally's Schindler stands out as a much more complex aberration of a very human (no matter how monstrous their actions) group of people.<br />I feel a little bad for having simply pitted book against movie as one so often does, but I have done so out of deference to the depressing likelihood that Keneally's book will forever be overshadowed by and tethered to the Spielberg ball and chain.  I have read that Spielberg's film is required viewing in many high schools.  Sad that Keneally's book isn't required reading.  Absent the triumphalism of the film, it stands as a sobering reminder that people can do terrible things, and that not all heroes are saints.	2001-02-05
US	50202496	R1JUX2XOJ4A5TH	1557042578	941831372	A Midnight Clear: A Novel	Books	3	9	12	N	N	The plot of a classic, but it loses lots in the telling...	I know of only two books that I have enjoyed LESS than the films that were based on them, but this is one of them (the other was Groom's &quot;Gump&quot;).  Wharton has a cracker of a plot but burdens it with a narrative voice that is often inconsistent to the point of distraction.  That, paired with a drastic lack of subtlety, made this a chore to plough through, despite the novel's numerous strengths.<br />For example, the protagonist narrating the story makes no claims to omniscience, and even shows, for obvious purposes of tension-building, bona fide surprise during crucial scenes.  However, there is another narrative voice that cuts in twice, for obvious purposes of emotion-building, and this voice belongs to the older, wiser narrator, who is writing about all of this years and years later.  His intrusions, occasional though they are, are an incongruity I found difficult to swallow, distractions that impeded my efforts to pick up again the thread of the story.  Such narrative asides are also surefire signs that an author is conscious of the fact that his or her main narrative layer isn't doing the work it's supposed to: conveying the appropriate emotion.  Hence, we get this: &quot;My eyes are full of tears just remembering this, years later, on my houseboat, in France,&quot; yada, yada.  If you have to remind me to cry, there's something wrong.  (Likewise, if you have to have the characters say each other's names EVERY TIME they open their mouths, it seems a defensive compensation for the fact that the characters are insufficiently delineated.  These guys repeat each other's names so conscientiously and so often I thought they were trying to sell something.)  There's also the annoying manner in which we are told that this is all being written down, while all the while the narrative voice is most assuredly a relaxed, spoken one, complete with unmistakably oral colloquialisms and syntax.  <br />This is all very picky, but more substantial problems gave me pause during a book that I desperately wanted to like.  There is a really amazing imbalance between the attention given to trivialities like the narrator's digestive problems and the attention given, on the other hand, to a moment marked explicitly as a sort of epiphany.  Granted, much of the focus on the humdrum and the everyday helps to really drive home the sort of boredom punctuated by moments of terror that we're told war is; but this scene in the attic of a snowbound chateau in the middle of God-knows-where, during which, the narrator tells us, he learned who he was and what he was made for, during which he gets his calling...why on earth don't we get the kind of detail here that we get when we read about bridge hands or chess moves?<br />If you can wade through this sort of stuff, or if you can block out some of these discrepancies, then you're in for a real treat when you hit the last 50 pages, which are much more tightly, understatedly, and beautifully written.  My overall opinion, though, is that Keith Gordon's film version of &quot;A Midnight Clear&quot; simply tells a great story better than Wharton's prose.  The film cuts to the chase without losing its way, enhances the build of the novel, and deals with some of the weightiest moments with much more subtlety than Wharton seems willing or able to muster.	2001-02-05
US	50202496	R2Y6Y3Z6HMUJ1K	1568581165	50197741	Father of Lies: A Novel	Books	3	6	8	N	N	Ad hominem, ad hominem, ad hominem	My experience of this novel was more than colored by the fact that I paid close attention to Evenson's professorial career in the immediate wake of the publication of his fine and controversial collection of short stories, &quot;Altmann's Tongue&quot; (for which he was practically hounded into leaving the university at which he was then teaching).  &quot;Father of Lies&quot; is, among other things, a pretty clear and pretty ad hominem attack on certain members of the administration at a certain private and religious university in Utah, and I think that the novel pulls up a bit short due to its unbridled bitterness (even if it's fun to match psychotic characters with their real-life near-namesakes, as one might do when reading, say, &quot;Primary Colors&quot; by Anonymous).  Some reviewers have admired the anger evident in the prose; I think it whittled characters down to fewer dimensions than are needed in what sets out to be a critique of the abuse of power in religious communities.<br />&quot;Father of Lies&quot; is really well-plotted and I was unable to put it down once I started reading.  Despite the reservations I mentioned above, it really is an engrossing read; the tension builds nicely and climaxes well, if a bit brutally (but we expect no less from an author unafraid of disturbing his audience, in the tradition of Kafka).  My biggest worry is that certain aspects of the novel make it difficult to accept as a functional critique in the manner that Evenson's foreward implies.  Doesn't the criminal protagonist's explicit emotional disturbance and psychological imbalance provide him with a reason, if not a full excuse, for behaving as abominably as he does?  I would have bought the critique of Fochs' actions more wholeheartedly were he depicted as having a choice or any authority at all over them.  His madness decides, though, and not he.<br />If details like this don't bother you, though, you're in for a harrowing and exciting read.  But if you really want to discover Evenson at his finest, buy &quot;Altmann's Tongue&quot; or &quot;Contagion&quot; (which has his O. Henry-winner &quot;The Brothers&quot; in it).discover Evenson at his finest, buy &quot;Altmann's Tongue&quot; or &quot;Contagion&quot; (which has his O.

However, Klam's New Yorker version of the story benefited immensely from an editor out to make it briefer and punchier, more focused.  The version in &quot;Sam the Cat and Other Stories&quot; is about five pages longer, but it feels about twenty.  And the only reason I'm telling this anecdote here is that, for me, this lack of punch and focus hurts a lot of the stories in the collection.<br />The funny moments in &quot;Sam the Cat and Other Stories&quot; are way too numerous to list in even the most abbreviated form, but, as one reviewer has pointed out already, some of them repeat themselves, so you'd probably have to list them twice.  More troublesome is the repetition of mindset, as one narrator after another gets smelted into one mass of undelineated young white male insecurity and aggression.  Part of why I read fiction is the way it's able to take me places; Klam only really ever takes you to one place, and not matter how much you like it and how funny it is, you will begin asking yourself where it all ends.  I can't help but compare &quot;Sam the Cat&quot; to another young white male collection of stories, but one that really reaches a good degree of breadth and humanity, Paul Rawlins' Flannery O'Connor Award-winning &quot;No Lie Like Love.&quot;  Rawlins shows you a spectrum of experiences, while Klam seems overly enamored of the same one.  Over.  And over.<br />I still like the collection, and will probably read it again.  (Hell, I'm teaching &quot;Issues I Dealt With in Therapy&quot; in a Short Fiction class next semester--the short version.)  But I want to see its author stretch on his next effort.  He's got way too much talent and style to be retreading the same tires for 200 pages.	2001-02-05
