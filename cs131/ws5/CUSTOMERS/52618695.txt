That describes my	Jesuit high school and college. But then again I think just about every Jesuit school graduate would say the same thing.<br />Ten men, no money, no business plan and within ten years they had thirty schools established and running.<br />And not only has the Jesuit order survived for over four hundred years (after its abolition by the Pope everywhere but in Russia), but it has thrived. There is simply no comparable for-profit corporation with that same history of longevity and success.<br />Igantius Loyola set out some clear policies that survive and work to this day.<br />Almost thirty years out from high school graduation I value my Jesuit education more than ever. What I've found is that the ability to reason, calculate, write and think is much more rare than I previously thought. To this I have the Society of Jesus to thank. I really can't imagine my life without my Jesuit education.<br />The Jesuit high school course of study is essentially the same for my son's class of 2007 as it was for my class of 1975. But it should be noted that the Jesuits have adapted and requirements in Greek and Latin are no longer there. The key here is some foreign language is essential for a high school student.<br />Money can come and go but education lasts and that can't be taken away from you.<br />There were lots of things I didn't know about the Jesuits that I learned in this book. Looking back I can see where these principles were applied. Things such as \\"only the best teachers.\\"<br />There is a definite Jesuit \\"way we do things\\" which is consistent at all Jesuit schools.<br />The references to \\"The Spiritual Exercises\\" were helpful and enlightening.<br />Some of the historical discussion about Paraguay, China and India was either unclear or slightly too long. Jim Rogers of \\"Adventure Capitalist\\" said it best about Paraguay. He described how the Jesuits had created a civilization there in the jungle and once the Jesuits were kicked out of the country,it relapsed and hasn't been the same since.<br />The readership for this book isn't limited to Jesuit school alumni or even those in business. If you want to lead a better and more productive life look at Lowney's distillation of Loyola's leadership principles, apply them and learn. ...	2004-03-22

Clever and	funny.<br />I can't recommend this book more highly. It is just exceptionally brilliant.<br />A social satire/comedy along the lines of Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and \\"A Man in Full\\" it is better in its own way.<br />It absolutely NAILS a part of American life after Sept 11, 2001.<br />It takes place in MA with a company called Playtime that has issues a la Tyco, Enron and Martha Stewart.<br />Willett has a real talent for dialogue. His gay clothes salesman is a real hoot. I don't know if he wrote it before \\"Queer Eye\\" was on the air but it sounds exactly like Carson Kreesley and it is all too funny.<br />Why this book is not on the best seller list just goes to show how inefficient Mr. Market is. Reading this book is like buying BRK.A at $1,300.<br />There's the CEO and what is he concerned about? His options and stock of course!<br />His characterizations are just great. Even minor characters like the lawyer Pearl are just very good.<br />Willett is a practicing lawyer in Boston so there is plenty of material to draw from and to that extent he's ahead of Tom Wolfe or John Grisham because he's living it and writing about it. Not just observing and writing.<br />Plenty of laughs about Dover and the goats. And milfs! What a great new word.<br />One of the best parts of the book are four lectures from the Amherst economics professor. This part is so good I wondered if it is fact or fiction.<br />It would make a great movie. No doubt about that.<br />Some clever misdirection and mystery lead to a very interesting ending.<br />Two points: 1. The NYSE opens at 9:30 eastern and not 9:00 AM.<br />2. Interesting to note that religion is not a part of the family's life and maybe that's part of the problem. Admittedly the book is a comedy but it delivers more and there is a slight reference at the end. To that extent I feel sorry for the secular Northeastern Boston-DC culture.	2004-02-13

Hard to believe the	author was a successful attorney in Texas. I guess the standards in Texas are fairly low.<br />I'm also feel bad for the author's son as he is the President's press secretary.<br />The author knows one thing about the law: you can't libel the dead. And he uses that to libel his now dead former law partners.<br />LBJ was no saint but I can't begin to accept the fact that he ordered the death of JFK.<br />The thing that turned me off right away is that the author claims he was a fairly recent hire at an Austin law firm and one of the partners tells this young associate employee that LBJ had JFK killed. That just doesn't begin to wash. I worked at a big law firm in Omaha and I can assure anyone that senior partners don't begin to tell new associate lawyers anything like that even if it were true.<br />And then the author goes on to allege that this same law firm was involved in all sorts of crimes.<br />The writing it too horrible to stand. No editor's pen touched this piece of work.<br />All in all, an embarrassment to the State Bar of Texas, the author and his family.	2003-12-31

Burke is a wonderful writer but	the story is secondary.<br />There is no &quot;murder mystery&quot; or plot involved. Dave just gets tips from various people and goes on hunches. No evidence to speak of.<br />The story just jumps around. Dave is violent. Others are violent. Dave is a reformed drunk. So are others.<br />And the reader is just sucked and addicted to Burke's spare conversations and word pictures.<br />The book is like the state of Louisania: An undeciferable and terrible beauty.<br />And it really annoys me how Burke drags in his left wing politics on the side. He complains about how his home state is polluted by oil interests and at the same time everyone is out fishing or watching the birds. So what is it? Is LA polluted or not?<br />And race and class just override everything.<br />The drinking laws of LA are unbelievable but who is to blame other than the people of LA?<br />Why are there so many criminals and greaseballs in LA? To some extent the people allow it.<br />Why doesn't Burke devote some of his wealth and influence and do something about drunk driving and the drive-up &quot;go cup&quot; business? The WSJ says one 80 year old lobbyist is behind the whole thing.<br />Yeah, I know it is fiction but it is based in fact. LA could do better but I guess it wouldn't be as interesting reading.	2003-12-02

Only two	other books (of the hundreds I've bought in my life) can make that claim. It's that good.<br />I'm a huge fan of aphorisms, truisms and axioms and that's the core of this book. The aphorisms are bound to together by a short and sweet text.<br />The author's real life losing experiences give him the authority to write the truth. He doesn't even list in full detail his background and the depth of his losses. No numbers but you know how far he fell. But his website gives you the detail: former CFO of a public company, Wall Street hot shot with an Ivy League education.<br />What was most helpful is that the book provides an analytic framework of how to win smart after losing.<br />Going through my two most recent losing events (stock market and divorce) I had the help of a friend who was able to express some of the insights from this book but it wasn't bound together by the research and time Stearns put into this book. It's all right in this book. One place.<br />In the notes he said he interviewed many people but only a few brief discussions are in the book. He edited out the bulk and, on reflection, I don't think the book would have been as good if it was a long list of &quot;war stories.&quot;<br />Thanks to Bill Kristol for his review of this book in &quot;The Weekly Standard.&quot; That recommendation - along with the title - prompted my purchase.	2003-09-12

Woodward might have been able to make them look bad, but they agreed to do it anyway.<br />Amazing access. What an open society we have. And you can be sure UBL and Saddam have read it too.

We got a taste of what it would have been like when Sen. H. Clinton said we should stop bombing during Ramadan of last year. Yeah, right.<br />A little slow in the middle.

Who, if anyone, killed Lenny Stilmach and why?<br />Then it is a comedy with several funny stories and characters. The story about the funeral of an Omaha politician was a howler.<br />There is the love/lust interest for our hero.<br />Computers, since they are a pervasive element of modern society, are prominently featured.<br />Drugs, unfortunately, are also in the same category.<br />The ancient vice of greed is the main element. The sick selling their life insurance policies during the their lifetime may or may not be a public good. It does happen but the criminal element have moved into the industry and many honest people have been bilked by what they thought was a safe investment doing some good for people.<br />Religion plays a role and shows that there is nothing new under the sun.<br />As in \\"Brainstorm\\" life imitates art. The recent takeover by the Florida Department of Insurance of Future First Financial Group (a viatical company) shows Dooling is right on the mark.<br />Detective Becker, styled after real Omaha detective Charlie Parker, is my favorite character.<br />The names are funny and, as an Omaha native, it is fun to see Omaha locations described in the book. But the insurance company Hartnett works for is NOT Mutual of Omaha or even Mutant of Omaha.	2002-11-11

I imagine the author likes to take a break from Harry Bosch. Harry has a history and is a dark and complex character. Henry Pierce is a new character but I imagine he'll be in another book.<br />What's nice about this book is that it's not from the police point of view. The main character is the victim/suspect.<br />Until this book I didn't notice the Stoicism in Connelly's novels. Maybe just now I'm recognizing it because I recently read some Stoics. Or maybe the modern American needs to be a Stoic to live without going insane.<br />I also love the way Connelly makes slight references to his other books/characters in his latest books.

The whole thing is just over the top.<br />You can figure out the murderer quite easily early in the book despite a pathetic red herring.<br />And all this business about lost love and affairs is just too much. I surely hope the real South is not like that.<br />Of the many things wrong about it, there is no way a real judge would instruct a jury in the way the judge in the novel did and people who watch television or saw OJ know that. So why even put it in the book?<br />And what's with the fascination with the rock star? I don't get it.<br />And the words are &quot;team work&quot; not &quot;teamwork&quot; at the end of the book. Hire better proofreaders.<br />The liberal slant on everything is just too much. A perfectly diverse cast of sensible liberals with NPR mugs who want to stop crime in the New South. No minority group was left out. Even Asians make a token appearance and that was a reach. Evil stupid fat Republicans who beat their wives and choke on ham biscuits.<br />Also pay close attention to the not so subtle anti-Catholic prejudice. Catholics obssessed with saints and unable to file for divorce. Unreal in the extreme.<br />The liberal guilt about past events is also revealing. Hello, Mr. Malone. Not only is the Civil War long over but so is slavery and oppression of Native American people. Move on, get over it and stop living in the past. The Taliban live in the past and that's not really a recipe for good living.<br />The more I think about it the more I dislike this book.<br />And while I won't reveal the ending, this whole book is an exercise in very bad judgment. The ACC and people of North Carolina deserve better.	2001-11-19

(BTW, _A Civil War_ is Feinstein's best.)<br />But the author goes Feinstein one better with some good insights  into the nature of golf and how the PGA Tour is so different from the other  major sports.<br />Toledo is a very interesting person. He grew up essentially  as an orphan in Mexico but was able to make the Tour.<br />I liked his  progress reports at the end of each chapter.	2000-06-26
US	52618695	RZGJ0MAG2XAKH	0060393408	962636193	The Case Against Hillary Clinton	Books	5	22	28	N	N	Smartly written. On target.	I've read the book and facts are stubborn things. It's clever to write a review asserting that the book is Sean Hannity with a thesaurus, but the book is not just opinion. It's about facts. Facts that won't go away.<br />Hillary's two major policy initiatives, health care and education  in Arkansas, were complete failures. And they both say volumes about how  she would govern.<br />The Travel office scandal is also instructive. Rather  than just remove the people under the President's patronage power she had  to ruin them with false accusations and a criminal trial.<br />Miss Noonan  touches on the cattle futures scam. The failure of the American people to  understand that these arranged trades were nothing more than a bribe still  stuns me. And Hillary had the gall not to pay all the income tax on her  bribes. I doubt the Clintons would have pulled that crime off in New  York.<br />Chapter five is brillant. I laughed out loud. Twice.<br />The author  also raises a very important point with her culture of death reference and  fish analogy.<br />The best thing she does is that she pre-empts many of  Hillary's upcoming campaign tricks and scams. Maybe the elite media will  call Hillary on it.<br />Did you ever wonder why HRC has so many different  hairstyles? Answer provided by Noonan.<br />Her point about honest liberals is  well-taken. I don't agree with Senator Bob Kerrey but I respect him. Not  the Clinton-Gore crowd. They called him a &quot;cripple&quot; and threw mud  at him in NH. It's all about power for the Clintons. And less freedom for  you. Because we aren't as smart as the Clintons and their crowd.<br />She's  already been to Nebraska getting money from Warren Buffett. But first she  stopped in a local store, Borsheim's, to buy china and silverware. I guess  the New York stores weren't good enough. Or maybe she didn't want to pay  the high NY sales tax.	2000-03-24

Big mistake.<br />The last two chapters make the book. Charming. If it's not true it should be. Think tuba.	2000-01-07

He seems like a decent, hard working man and I liked him for his fairness and smarts.<br />Dr. Tom uses this book, in a nice way, to  make some points and answer his critics. Riley Washington, for example, was  acquitted for shooting at a car but the critics would have thrown him off  the team. He was found not guilty so Osborne was right to let him play.<br />He doesn't go too much into l'affair Phillips but I agreed with him on  that. He points out the media errors. What Phillips did is not too much  different what many college students did/do about breaking up.<br />I found  his point system similar to the demerit system at my Jesuit high school;  albeit modified for college in the 90's.<br />His mentoring program indicates  where his heart is. He didn't need to do that and I can't think of  another  coach doing something similar.<br />I won't give it away, but I was very  surprised by his decision-making process regarding his retirement.<br />One  final note for certain Big Red fans, the coaches spend a great amount of  time watching the players practice and grading the films. Stop  second-guessing the play calling and the playing time. Dr. Tom makes that  point in his indirect way.	2000-01-04

That being said, there is still a lot of substance. The author's treatment of the Microsoft trial in one chapter is the best I've read.<br />This book,  without a doubt, is the story of Jim Clark; serial billionaire. Not having  a Valley background I was curious as to how seminal his role was in chaning  investors' preceptions about companies. Undoubtly the Netscape IPO was  important but was it that much of a watershed event?<br />Lewis notes a number  of times that Clark has no interest in the past, but the whole book is  really about his past.<br />The chapter on the Healtheon IPO roadshow and the  Wall Street Journal article was absolutely great. Lewis can really  write.<br />The inside baseball aspect of the book is why did Clark allow  Lewis the great access? What's the  agenda? Is it to help the IPO of myCFO?  I don't think so, but I wondered about the book's utility as a tool to  promote not only Clark but at least HLTH.	2000-01-03
