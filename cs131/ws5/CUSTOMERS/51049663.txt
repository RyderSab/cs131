My 22 month old son is totally head-over-heels with Dora, and he also loves enjoys counting activities.  We just got this book yesterday, and he's already had us read it over and over.  The numbers are very easy to find on the page, and the pictures are very cute and simple.   <br /> <br />We aren't using the Spanish part of the book yet.  Tico the squirrel (who, as all good Dora fans know, only speaks Spanish) presents the Spanish word in the corner of each page.  My son always points to Tico, but the picture is done in a very non-distracting way.	2005-02-21
US	51049663	R3JF9IYELE1WTP	0743418174	780559593	Good in Bed	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Good read	I had seen this book on the best sellers table for quite some time at my local bookstore, and I finally picked it up.  It is definitely not a waste of time as some reviewers have mentioned- it is an entertaining read.  It did take me a bit of time to get into the book, and the book has sections that could have been explored in fewer pages.  But overall, this is an interesting book.<br />In a nutshell, Cannie is a reporter, and she has just informed her long time boyfriend Bruce that she wants to take a break.  She is an attractive yet larger woman, and he is a slob and a dopehead.  He interprets her desire as a breakup, and he uses his new gig with a Cosmo/Maxim-type magazine to explain why it takes courage to date a larger woman.  She becomes livid, but she thinks she's made a mistake by severing herself from Bruce.  The rest of the book explores her journey of self-discovery that leads from this one event.  She meets a few new people, including Dr. K who leads her weight-loss class, and Maxi, a Hollywood megastar who befriends Cannie during a crying session in a hotel restroom.<br />The book delves quite a bit into Cannie's childhood, and these scenes help you fully understand her hangups with men and why she continues to pine over Bruce.  These are very key sections of the book; however, at times they dragged on and slowed the book down.  <br />I disagree with those who felt this is part of the Bridget Jones genre- this book is much more serious and not as flip.  It is merely a book about an average woman who has emotional pains and finds herself working through these pains after finding joy.<br />Without giving too much of the plot away, there is one part where the author gets preachy regarding a very difficult, emotional and controversial topic facing today's society.  As I read Cannie's thoughts while she was making a difficult life decision, I found I stopped hearing the words of Cannie and began hearing the very preachy words of the author.  I do not have aproblem reading about this particular topic; however, I felt like I was being beat over the head with in one section and found it distracting.<br />Although I agree with another reviewer that a Hollywood megastar would probably not take a near total stranger under her wing the way Maxi does in the book.  But her character is fun and caring and compassionate, and she's just a nice person to have in the book.  All of her giving actually made ME feel guilty!<br />I recommend this book.	2004-07-18

Like most of the other reviewers, I, too, enjoy hearing Sheri's acerbic wit on the air each morning.  I wasn't sure if her writing was going to be as good as her on-air persona, but it almost is.   I just had my first baby last year, so I was pregnant at the same time as Sheri, and I was so excited to see that she has done a book on Mommydom.<br />You want to connect to this book, and I almost did. I kept wondering, &quot;Am I a Misfit?&quot;  I fortunatly had a great childhood, but I'm still neurotic.  I saw myself in so many of her stories.  But I sometimes wondered if this was meant for me.  Often, Sheri refers to the Misfit as one whose childhood was quite traumatic, leaving an adult ready for any tragic situation and preparing for the worst.  I just was never sure if Sheri's Misfit has to have a terrible childhood.<br />Everything else is great.  She has lots of funny little stories about morning sickness, etc., and some sweet stories as well.  I especially liked her story about how your baby has been with you forever (you have to read the book to get the full story!).<br />I was expecting a bit more about the actual role of the mommy post-birth, and this book does deal more with pregnancy.  Is there a sequal in the works?<br />And Sheri, no, a child's toilet does not belong in the restaurant!  I have to side with Bob on that one.	2004-06-04

She works for a small newspaper writing tips for the home, and she knows that she is never promoted because of her weight.  One of her coworkers is a nice and gorgeous man who she thinks is out of her league, but she just about falls all over herself any time he's around.  Then things start changing for her when she starts losing her weight, and that's when the disappointment started for me.<br />Now, before I get into what I feel are flaws in the book, I do want to say that you will love Jemima.  You will hate her roommates as much as she does.  You will like Ben and Genevive.  Jemima's the kind of girl you want to be friends with no matter how she looks.  <br />First, I thought Jemima's description was not accurate.  You find that she is 5 feet, 7 inches, and is approximately 100 pounds overweight.  She has several chins, and her feet are so fat that when she loses weight, she has to get smaller shoes.  However, if you read carefully, you will see that she starts at around the 215 mark.  First, that would mean that 115 is what she should weigh.  Based on the American BMI chart (yes, I realize that the book is British), that would make her underweight.  Additionally, I know several women who are about this height and weight, yet do not have multiple chins.  I was so glad to find a book with an overweight heroine, only to find her unrealistic.  Plus, people find that she's beautiful AFTER she loses the weight.  Can't she be beautiful WITH the weight?  I have to agree, the weight becomes a cliche.<br />When Jemima does lose the weight, everyone is so happy for her!  However, there is one little paragraph where the narrator explains that her gym's personal trainer is the only one concerned about her weight loss, but there's no follow up.  I thought it would lead to a story line about the dangers of fast weight loss or eating disorders, but no.  Nothing.<br />Although I donot expect any great writing to appear from this genre, I was thrown more that I usually am by the constant switching between first person and third person.  The book is primarily told by Jemima, but suddenly, the next paragraph is in third person as if looking at Jemima from above.  I expected third person when the book discusses the happenings surrounding the other characters, but I found the constant back and forth distracting.  However, I either got used to it, or this switching occurs mainly in the first half of the book.<br />I have a one year old, so I hardly get a chance to read.  I'm glad I read this book at the beach, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are like me and find it hard to read during a regular day.  I would not have not been as satisfied with the book if I had read this during my precious reading time at home!	2004-06-04

My son is totally facinated with Elmo, so he instantly took to this book.  Don't let the cover fool you, however.  This book includes most of the Sesame Street characters, including, in part, Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster and Grover.  There were also two characters included who I am not as familiar with- Hoots and Prarie Dawn.  The characters keep finding bunny rabbits all over the place, and they don't know the source of the bunnies.  At the end, Big Bird tells his friends his bunnies have run away, and then he realizes that his friends have found his bunnies.  The last two pages are great and show all of the characters in the book at one time.  <br />This is a very quick book, and you can read it to your little one in less than 2 minutes.	2004-03-22

I received this for Christmas, and I definitely enjoy cooking with this book!  <br />I do agree that it doesn't always take 30 minutes for one of these meals.  I'm not one who prepares everything all of my produce as soon as I step in the door from the grocery store.  But I'm realistic, I just add on prep time, but I do find that it doesn't add on too much time to the meal.  <br />I am a huge fan of French Onion soup, and there is a wonderful recipe for Oh-So-Good Onion soup in here.  The only slow part is having to thinly slice six onions.  I have also enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan recipe.  The sauce made waaaay more than was needed for two people, and I had enough left over for two addditonal meals.  <br />Many of the recipes do call for alcohol of some sort (there is dry sherry in the Onion soup), but most cooks on Food Network (and the world) use alcohol- Sara Moulton, Emril, Tyler Florence, etc.  When you cook with alcohol, the alcohol evaporates anyway.  Now many of the desserts call for liquors, and of course, this does not evaporate, but you can use substitutes from different sources.  <br />I also find that these recipes are rather easy to adapt to a low calorie/low fat diet.  The Chicken Parmesan recipe calls for the chicken to be breaded, browned and broiled, but I just sauteed the chicken in Pam using the spices in the recipe instead- still very yummy!!!  Rachael does say that her meals are healthy- and I would agree that most are healthy in that they are balanced.  However, some meals are fried, breaded, etc.<br />I do recommend watching 30 Minute Meals if you haven't already to get a better idea of the style of these meals.  One reviewer said she was hoping there would be more tips on things like timing.  I am STILL working on my own timing, but watching her show will DEFINITELY help you with this!  I have seen her prepare many of the meals included in this cookbook, so I know everyone can pick up a thing or two about her style by watching.  I have found, though, that timing is what has slowed me down when using these recipes.<br />Desserts are not a focus of this book.  She emphasizes that she does not bake, and you can't really bake in 30 minutes anyway.  However, the ones I've tried have been quite good.  She has one recipe that is not included in the book that is very good!  Her recipe for Fudge Chocolate Wreath that I saw on 30 Minute Meals around Christmas was a huge hit.  I did not make it in the wreath shape, but the taste was wonderful.  She uses currants in her fudge, and I was a bit weary of that, but it added a nice cherry flavor.<br />All around, I am definitely enjoying this book!  I do recommend it for day-to-day cooking needs over my other favorite cookbook, Sara Moulton Cooks at Home.	2004-01-11

I did use this book often to check out definition of terms, but it was just a bit to simplistic for me.  Don't get me wrong- I had no experience in this area (I didn't even know what earnest money was), and I didn't even fully realize what the process was.  Still, I found this book to just be a bit to basic.  The basics are definitely necessary, but a bit more depth is definitely needed.	2003-03-26
US	51049663	R3DYC55TXQU3KG	0767907701	251738166	Sara Moulton Cooks at Home	Books	4	38	38	N	N	All around good cookbook	Sara Moulton is by far my favorite TV chef, and I've been watching her for about 3 years on both &quot;Cooking Live&quot; and &quot;Sara's Secrets.&quot;  If you've ever tried her recipes that are available from her shows, then you know that her style of cooking is simply all around good food.  Her show has inspired me to try new things and styles of cooking, and this cookbook continues in that tradition.<br />The recipes in this cookbook appear to be a bit more difficult than the ones that she usually features in her shows, but they are still very reasonable.  The variety of recipes runs from hors d'oeurves to soups to meat dishes to deserts.  There are even separate sections on vegetarian main courses and breakfast foods.  Most of the meat dishes also include a tidbit letting you know the appropriate wine to serve with that dish. The beginning of the book includes a special section that defines what the the items in recipes mean (like when she says eggs, she means large ones).  I especially like the section she calls Pantry.  This includes simple recipes for essentials such as chicken stock and vinaigrette dressing.  <br />She has included personal stories with almost every recipe, and many of the recipes have been inspired by close friends and family.  For example, she tells how her sister makes wonderful cookies and has continued making cookies their grandmother Ruth made, hence the setup for Ruth Moulton's Spice Balls.  These personal touches help bring life to the cookbook.<br />I do wish there were more pictures of the food, however.  Even though my cooking never looks as perfect as the pictures in the cookbooks, I like having an idea of how it's supposed to turn out.  I do wish there were just a few more recipes that are styled for a quick meal- most of the recipes are a bit time intensive.<br />I strongly recommend this cookbook, but just keep in mind it's not for a beginner.	2003-01-23

I really wanted to get The Mother of All Baby Books, but my store didn't have it.  Turns out, Ann Douglas wrote both books, so it didn't matter.<br />I found the preconception advice wonderful.  It also gives you an overview of what to expect when you're actually pregnant, and breaks it down week by week.  There are several helpful charts in the book, such as one that goes over the most common prescription and non-prescription drugs and the effects they have on the baby.  There's also information on fertility testing when things don't go as planned.<br />However, now that I'm 7 months pregnant first time mom-to-be, I find I don't use the book very often.  The week-to-week information is great when you want to know what to expect before you get pregnant/just get pregnant, but it's not sufficient information to keep you really informed when you're actually at those critical points.  I find that the book is lacking in details on those conditions that can pop up during pregnancy, such as increased heart rate, shortness of breath, etc.  These are normal events, but I just wanted more information on what to expect and when to expect these kinds of conditions.<br />Overall, it's still a great book.  I definitely recommend it to those who are trying.  However, if you're already pregnant, I recommend Your Pregnancy Week By Week.  This has been my favorite book so far.	2003-01-20

We love how Lynne Cheney took each letter of the alphabet and made it stand for a patriotic value, such as V is for Valor. Now that we've got a child on the way, we can't wait to share the lessons taught by this book to our new child.  The illustrations are awesome- the details are amazing, and I know that kids will enjoy studying them. <br />This kind of book is appropriate for all ages, young and old. Patriotic lessons are not always to easiest to teach since they are often abstract, and it can take life experiences to fully understand some of the concepts, but this is a great way to start younger children.  Pride in our country and an understanding of the price of freedom is something that we should all be working on to instill in each child, and this is a great tool.	2002-06-24

The story is fun, fast and catchy, and I used to wish that I was one of the little girls standing amongst the two straight lines lead by Miss Clavel.  <br />This book is not just for little girls.  Boys can enjoy the story as well.	2002-06-24

At the end of each chapter is a prayer and several applicable verses.<br />I enjoyed using this book as part of my daily devotional period.  The issues are concisely discussed, and the prayers are helpful and well written.  I've used this book as a springboard for thought, discussion and of course, prayer.  If you're looking for something very deep and indepth on a particular issue, this isn't the purpose of the book.  You will probably also find that not all of the issues apply to your husband.  But this book does make you examine your husbands life, as well as aspects of your own life.  It will make you think.  It has helped me change some of my thoughts and my prayers.  It is definitely a great place to start if you're trying to grow your prayer life for your husband.	2002-05-21

The story starts with her earliest memory and ends with her current life situation.  Nothing ever seems to go right in Delores's life- in just a few short years, her lives through divorce, incessant teasing by classmates, obesity, a somewhat unwilling lesbian experience, suicide attempts, abortion, mental abuse, adultry, mental illness and other life-alteirng experiences.  You feel her pain and her anxiety, but you will also laugh at some of her experiences and her thoughts.  <br />I didn't realize this book was as dark as it is when I started to read.  I would tell others what was going on in my book, and they couldn't believe I was reading such a sad tale.  Yes, it is sad, but the novel just grabs you from the start, and you can't put the book down.  You want to know what happens next- what does Delores decide?  Did she really do that?  Why won't she say yes?  Her character is well developed, and I never found myself asking, &quot;Now, just where did that plot line go?&quot;  The book is not confusing- you know who all of the characters are, and they are described very vividly, so you end up with a real mental picture of who they are both physically and mentally.<br />I am also one who can't believe this book was written by a man.  Wally Lamb definitely did his homework when he wrote as Delores- his voice made an effective female character.  <br />This is definitely one of the better Oprah's Book Club books!	2002-05-14

I was so excited to see this sequal on the shelves at my local bookstore, and I bought it immediately.  This is another light hearted tale of Becky and her credit card blues.  Luke tries to open up an office of his PR firm in New York, and he whisks Becky away with him.  Of course, Becky can't get enough of the Big Apple's stores, and she goes right back into debt.  There are some interesting plot twists in here- evil businessmen/women, intrigue and a slap-in-the-face disappointment.  <br />I knew this was going to be a light book when I bought it, but I was surprised at just how light it ended up being.  You knew Becky was going to get into shopping trouble, but all of her shopping sprees started to get a bit old by the middle of the book.  The ending is definitely good and was a fresh surprise- I can't say anything more about that, but she ends up doing something I never would have thought of doing.  I would have liked to have seen a few more plot lines more developed (like with Luke's mother) and less on the spending.  I just think that I thought the first was best because it was new.<br />I really like Becky Bloomwood, and I wouldn't mind reading about her again.  I just don't know where the series would go from here.  But if you like Bridget-type books, you'll like this, too!	2002-04-18

It's amazing that she was basically just taken away from her parents at a young age in order to become an adopted daughter of the king, since he had a daughter the same as as Malika and the daughter needed a playmate.  Malika gives an interesting account of the ways of the court- the traditions, the festivals, the reverence paid to the king and the concubines.  As a child, she never had a normal life- she was essentially a prisoner inside the court.  I would have liked to have read more vivid and detailed accounts of the court- not gossipy, just from a cultural standpoint.  I had a hard time picturing many of the scenes she described due to vagueness.<br />After her father, a revered military man, was executed after leading a coup against the king, he was executed and the family sent into exile, even though the family had nothing to do with the coup.  The conditions were incomprehensibly inhumane.  I'm amazed that Malika is able to talk about it so freely, for she even admits she's haunted by the demons.  It's difficult to even empathize despite her account, for I've never experienced anything like she went through.  It's a story that sounds more like 15th century Europe than 20th century Morocco.  Her youngest brother was only 3 when they were imprisoned.  She describes how amazed he was with the world when a few of them were able to escape.  For instance, he finds something hard on the ground but didn't know what it was- it was simply asphalt.  <br />I was shocked that I had never heard of her story, and I am upset that the US media has not focused more on political prisoners such as Malika and her family.  No, I'm not a card-carrying member of Amnesty International or anything, but it is important to bring stories such as Malika's to light.  As her story reveals (but without going into too much detail), when the international media learns of their plight, circumstances  change.  <br />Malika is very forthright with her opinions and emotions.  She describes how her feelings towards the king were so mixed with the love of a daughter towards her father and with the hatred of the wrongly imprisoned towards the captor.  Her whole view of the world has changed, and yet a lot of her original opinions never changed.  <br />I recommend this book!	2002-04-12

We had been frequenting the Chapel Hill Greenway, and, well, it's just not very challenging.  So, we picked up this book.<br />It's a very informative book.  There are maps of most of the trails, which really helps you get a feel of the lay of the trail.  Each trail has is accompanied by a lengthy description which include items such as:<br />*driving directions<BR>*flora on the trail<BR>*total distance of the trail<BR>*distance of trail segements<BR>*types of trails (dirt, gravel, footbridges)<BR>*geography of trail (hills, streams, roads to cross)<br />The only issue we really had with the book were the driving directions.  We were trying to get to a trail at Jordan Lake during the summer, and we weren't totally familiar with the area.  We were following the directions in the book, but we really needed a few more geographical points to help us find the roads.  Also, once we got to the trail area, we couldn't find the trailhead.  The state did not do a good job marking the head, but it would have been nice to have known this in the trail description.  <br />However, we did &quot;discover&quot; the Duke cross country trail from this book.  We enjoy this trail- it is the perfect length for us and it's difficult enough to be a challenge.  We also discovered that if you get caught in a rainstorm out there, there's absolutely nowhere to go!<br />If you like to walk in the Triangle, get this book!	2002-03-04

Everest Disaster	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Surprisingly good read	For years, I'd heard a lot of good things about \\"Into Thin Air.\\"  However, I'm not a climber, and I thought I'd seen and heard enough about the Everest disaster.  I finally picked up Krakauer's book, and I'm glad I did.<br />For starters, the book is fast paced (for the most part) and is written for both climbers and non-climbers alike.  Krakauer takes responsibility for some of the tragedies of Everest in the book, but you can also understand how some of the poor exercises in judegement were exacerbated by the lack of oxygen above the so-called \\"death zone.\\"  Krakauer does a fair job of just telling the straight facts, but of course you know that it's just one point of view on the story.  For instance, Krakauer was not a fan of Anatoli Boukreev, a fellow climber from Russia who was serving as one of the guides.  Of course, there are two sides to every issue, but it does make you question the judgement of others, not just Krakauer's.<br />It was also interesting to learn more about the Sherpas, the trip to the mountain and just some interesting tidbits I never really thought about.  For instance, there's a field of empty oxygen bottles up near Camp Four.  I never really thought about it, but all those people do produce trash, and if they don't remove it, it just stays.  Luckily, there is an effort to clean the mountain.  I had also been interested in perhaps going to Base Camp if I ever had the chance, but after reading about the camp where you have to stay before you reach Base Camp, I'm having to reconsider.<br />This wa just a good book to read from just a sheer adventure point of view.  I strongly recommend this book.	2002-03-03

I had recently read Jewell's first book, \\"Ralph's Party,\\" and I thought it was a very fun book.  But when I started reading this book, it was too much like \\"Ralph.\\"  Dig and Nadeen smoked the same cigarettes, ate lots of currys and had pretty much the same personalities as those in \\"Ralph.\\"  Plus, Dig finally gets a shot at trying to hook up with his dream girl, which is almost the same basic situation in \\"Ralph\\" (but the details are different).  <br />I almost gave up on this book, but I got sucked in and kept reading.  The second half is much better than the first.  The characters grow, and you start rooting for two of the characters to get together (can't tell you which ones!).  You will rightfully loathe Phil, and you will want Nadine to be less gulliable.  However, I think Lisa Jewell creates too many characters who are recreational drug users and casually sleep around.  <br />If you like British culture, you'll probably enjoy this book.  I'm quite the Anglophile, so I usually enjoy these sorts of books.  I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't read \\"Ralph\\" first, but I'm glad I didn't quit reading.	2002-02-20

Frankly, I couldn't see how such a small book was making such a fervor.<br />I finally received it for Christmas, and I read a chapter each day as part of my daily devotion.  WOW- this book takes the small prayer of Jabez and shows what strong Bibical truths are hidden in such a seemingly random prayer.  The book will challenge the way you think and will make you reevaluate my prayer life.  I begin each day with a prayer, and I've incorporated the principles in this book.  I've already seen some great blessings!<br />You will see how the prayer of Jabez reveals the need to ask God for his blessings;to want to expand your \\"territory,\\" which can mean anything from your ministry to your family to your business; to keep God's hand upon you; and to keep you from evil.  Although this book is short enough to be read in one sitting, I found it very valuable to only read short sections at a time.  That way, you can reflect on each principle individually.	2002-02-05

Even though I am not familiar with the painting or Vermeer, I've learned about some of his paintings and his favorite subject matters.  This book will especially interest you if you are a history buff or an art lover.<br />Griet tells the story in first person.  You feel her pain, her fear, her insecurities and her frustrations.  Her family forces her into servanthood after her father is stricken blind in a kiln accident.  She goes to work for the painter Vermeer.  Even though he is the man of the house, it is clear he does not run the house.  His wife, Catharina, and his mother-in-law, Maria Thins, are the true overseers of the house.  Catharina is perpetually pregnant, and the house is full of little girls.  One in particular, Cornilia, proves to be a handful.<br />The book educates the reader as it describes the life of a maid in the 17th century, as well as some of the notions and the culture of 17th century Holland.  I would have liked for the book to be longer, but the book is the perfect length for the story lines that are developed.  All of the story lines are completed, and I didn't find myself wanting to know more about certain characters.  <br />I look forward to reading Tracy Chevalier's other works.	2002-01-23

I thoroghly enjoyed reading this book!  <br />Gwyn Hyman Rubio effectively brings you into the world of little Icy Sparks.  You feel her pain, her embarassment, her anger.  I got so mad reading about her teacher, Mrs. Stilton.  What made the reading more interesting is that you don't know for sure what her disorder is (although you can figure it out) until the end of the book.  I knew nothing about Torette's other than the foul language part, and it was interesting to find out about the eye popping and the body convulsions.<br />I would have liked to see a bit more description on the eye popping part.  Every time I reached that part of Icy's fits, I just kept picturing the lady who had been on Letterman a few years back who could make her eyes seriously buldge out of her head.  <br />I especially enjoyed the end of the book.  It has a great ending, and you feel very happy for Icy.  But don't be mislead- it's not a typical feel good book.  Icy has a disorder, but she learns how to make the best of it.	2002-01-18

I did end up liking it, but it really left a lot to be desired.<br />First, the book is painfully thin.  Most of the book is just a rehash of interviews from his show.  There are some very interesting portions, such as his investigations and learning about those who refuse to come on his show.  By the same token, it was interesting to find out who surprisingly would show up in the No Spin Zone.<br />This book really revealed nothing new to me about where he stands on the issues.  His first book gave me a lot of background on where he came from and his experiences in the business, and that was great.  It helped me understand where he's coming from on his topics, and that just helps me respect him more.  But I felt like this book was just a lot of rambling on about specific topics without a lot of depth.<br />Still worth your while to read, but Mr. O'Reilly, I'd love to see a more indepth look at the No Spin Zone!	2002-01-18

The title of this book is a bit of a misnomer- when I started reading, I thought that the book would begin with a party, and the rest of the book would be about how the events of that night changed everyone's lives.  <br />It was quite refreshing to see that I was wrong!  Acutally, most of the book describes the lives of six singles living in London, and the party is just where everything pans out.  <br />The characters are very well developed.  Sibohan, Jem and Ralph are the ones you learn the most about, but you still learn a great deal about Karl as well.  The other two, Smith and Cheri, are not as well developed, but you don't really feel like you are missing any information about them.  <br />The plot is fast moving and keeps you entertained.  Everything is well thought out- all plot lines are followed through with to their completion.  <br />This is the first Lisa Jewell book I've read, and I look forward to reading more!	2002-01-17

The plot lines move slowly, and there are sudden jumps in time.  You'll be reading along in one chapter, you run across a break, and the next thing you know several years have passed.  However, you don't even know that for several paragraphs, so it's too easy to get distracted and confused.  I also think too many sub-plots and the recollections of the characters were not always expanded upon enough, either.  <br />I did think that Amanda, Mathilda and Ruth are well developed characters, and you do feel sympathy for them all.  However, I would have liked to see Ruth's father, Carl, and Imogene, Ruth's friend (and something else to the story...) more developed.  Imogene especially- I felt like I didn't really know here.	2002-01-09

Immediately, you are introduced to Claire, who speaks to the reader in first person.  Claire has just given birth to a baby girl, and her husband subsequently arrives and tells her that he is leaving her.  Immediately upon release from the hospital, she leaves her London home with her new baby, Kate, and goes back to her parents, who live in Dublin.  <br />You will find that you really get to know Claire as she goes through so many emotional states- depression, anger, and love for her new child.  Claire tries to fill the void left by her husband by dating again, and she finds that she is very attracted to Adam.  The problem is that Adam is friends with her younger sister!<br />The only thing I did not like about this book was Claire's sound off near the end of the book regarding abortion.  No matter how you feel about this hot button issue, I did not think it was appropriate for Ms. Keyes to interject her opinions in the way that she did.  This book is supposed to be fun, and this particular section distracted me.  <br />However, I'm not holding it against this book!  Read it- you will love it!	2002-01-05

I was reading it around Christmas, and it really made me think about what's happened to me this year.  It's a quick read, which was nice- I read it in 2 sittings.  I also enjoy reading books that are set in North Carolina such as this.  <br />However, the ending was very disappointing.  I don't want to reveal it here in case you do decide to check this out.  Yet I was reading this book to get in a good Christmas mood, and I wanted a happy ending.  I didn't get it here.  It's also a bit misleading to say that the letters are from three generations of women, since the third generation only contributes one letter.	2001-12-27

I am so glad I picked this one up!  This story follows Astrid through the trials of losing her emotionally challengin mother to prison and the numberous foster homes she ends up in.  After reading this story, I just wanted to give Astrid a home and a hug!  <br />Janet Finch does an excellent job of drawing the reader into Astrid's world.  We feel her fear, her pain and her joy.  We are comfortable when Astrid is safe; we are on pins and needles when she is in a terrible home.  Her mother doesn't win high marks with me, and the reader will want to shake some sense into her.  Of course, Astrid is no angel, and I kept wanting to tell her to stop and everything will be okay. <br />If you don't want your hug to be tugged or want to think about how the US can improve the foster home situation, then don't read this book!  It will make you think!	2001-12-19

Bill O'Reilly will be the first to tell you that he doesn't want you to know what side of the fence is is on.  In this book, he says he wants you to read the book and be even more uncertain about his political leanings when you are finished.  I have come away thinking he's a registered Independent, but I'm not certain.  That's one of the great things about this book.<br />I didn't agree with everything he had to say, especially about religion.  But that's the thing I like about Bill O'Reilly- he doesn't toe any one party line, and I do disagree with him sometimes.  I also agree with him a lot, mainly because I do feel that he is trying to get the truth about situations out to the public.  I'm glad he isn't afraid to speak his mind about things.  He gets a lot of heat about it, but that's what makes him such a unique person in the media- he tells it like it is.  Sometimes the truth hurts, and a lot of people can't take that, and that's evident in the viewer mail he shares with the reader in the book.<br />Some of the parts of the book are silly, like his list of favorite things (like movies), so it's not all political.<br />So, if you like an intellectual challenge, read this book.  No matter if you're liberal, conservative, or on your own, you will think while you read.  If you don't like Bill O'Reilly, that's an even better reason to read.  At least you can get a picture on where he's coming from.	2001-12-19

This was not a book I would have normally bought just based on the description, but I'm so glad I did!  I found myself in the lives of three individuals, all of whom I felt sympathy for, but none that I just truly liked.  This was great, since I couldn't decide who I wanted to be able to keep the house in question.  All of the charachters are flawed, and it's nice to read a book without a hero for a change.  The end was a true suprise- one that I would never have guessed.  I was never bored while reading.  The pace is quick, and the story flows well.  I highly recommend this book!	2001-12-17

I was just about to push into my early teen years, and I really had no clue what to expect.  I read this book, and I although I couldn't relate to everything in it at the time, it was presented in a clear, logical and Godly way.  As the years went by, I began to relate more and more to Dr. Dobson's words, and I recalled his suggestions often.  Now, I'm buying this for my much younger sister as she begins her trip into her teen years.	2001-12-10

The story moves quite quickly, and I share the character's disdain for bees.  The main problem I had with the book is that it feels like the author is trying too hard to reach for the next level of prose.  It read quite natural, but sometimes, you just find yourself in a passage feeling that the words just do not fit.  All in all, an enjoyable read.	2001-12-04

I've read several good books on marriage, but this one is different because Toben and Joanne are young and very practical.  They are also very honest and are striving to have a God centered marriage.  All of this combines into a very user friendly book.  I'm still reading it, but I've already incorporated some of their suggestions into my marriage.  I can see my husband and I in them often, so I have had to be very honest with myself about some things.  I definitely recommend this book to those of you who are engaged or recently married.	2001-03-01

I was excited at first, but my excitement quickly faded as I muddled my way through the book.  I kept hoping that the  book would get better, but it didn't.  I agree with another reviewer that  there isn't enough character development here, even with Jane.  She comes  off very shallow, and she's not someone I would really care to know.   <br />Another mysterious section is one of the stories in the middle of the  book.  The narrator is Nina, not Jane, and it doesn't really fit anywhere  in the book, except she is the downstars neighbor of Jane's much older  boyfriend.  I kept waiting for any of the characters in that section to  reappear, but they never do.  Something funny does happen in that section,  but you never know what the resolution is.<br />The best part of the book is  the last section where she tries to live by the oft-mocked Rules.  I wish  more of the book was like the last section!	2000-07-05
