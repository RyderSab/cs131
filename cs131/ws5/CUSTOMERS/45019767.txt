It is also one of the funniest books I have ever read, with a  mixture of witty smart mouth one liners ala Myron Bolitar and farcical Tom Sharpe style comic moments.  The crime novel is gripping, the comedy induces hysterical laughter and the one liners make you wish you were that sharp - this is all in one electric package. The story set in Edingburgh involves corruption in the National Health system, an ugly murder and a hitman who bites off the victims fingers before stuffing them up his nostrils.  Our hero Jack is a journalist (strange in itself)who escaped LA to avoid a hitman who was after him.  He then arrives in his home town of Edinburgh to find the guy in the appartment below has been murdered.  Jack to avenge the prior attempt on his life gets involved in this helter skelter ride to help the police catch the crooks with amazing consequences.  Quite Ugly One Morning is entertainment nothing more, but superb entertainment at that.	2005-05-23

While I am a huge fan of the TV episodes, due in no small part to the work of John Thaw as he portays our hero, I find the level of detail offered by the books even more captivating.   <br /> <br />This book tells the story of the first case that Morse and his sidekick Sergent Lewis are assigned to.  A young woman last seen hitchhiking with a friend is found battered to death in a pub yard later the same night.  Morse and Lewis are human and make many mistakes as they fight through lies and deceit to finally uncover the truth.  The twist at the end is a real shock, cleverly worked leaving a feeling of sadness with the reader. <br /> <br />But the quality of the Morse series by Colin Dexter is not the interesting stories or clever twists that are a requirement of a good mystery.  The real attraction is the character of Morse, a hugely complex man, alcoholic, lovable, egotistic, vunerable, cultured, bad tempered, lonely, this is no infallible super hero.  Morse also uses his intelligence not his athletic brawn to sift through the clues, something not seen often in murder mystery these days (probably because if the detective has to think so does the author).  <br /> <br />There are only a few quality mystery writers out there still writing, Mr Dexter is one of the best exponents of his craft and well worth your attention.	2004-11-25
US	45019767	R3DZH8VSAW3VO3	0316926086	926124045	The Loved One	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Dead Funny	Waugh is wickedly merciless in this attack, his use of humor morbid and obsene, his wit piercing, as always he leaves no room for empathy or sympathy as he cruely dissects his victims.  His targets are common themes in many of his works, the British upper class, the Catholic Church, a lack of post war standards, human vanity ,love and the biggest of all, any symbol of the establishment (in this case societies method for the disposal of the dead).   <br /> <br />This short book skewers all of the above, set against the Los Angeles British film community in the thirties. Our central character (not hero) is Dennis Barlow, british expatriate, failed poet and employee of the Happier Hunting Ground Pet Cemetry.  After the suicide of his mentor Sir Francis, Dennis has the task of arranging the funeral at the hallowed Whispering Glades Funeral Home where he falls in love with cosmetician Aimee. <br /> <br />There are cultural problems, class of funeral establishment issues and a rival suitor in the shape of embalmer Mr Joybody.  Waugh as you would expect extracts the maximum humor from every situation, allows no sentiment to creep into the novel or even endearing qualities in his characters.  As with much of his work the love story ends in tragedy, no one much cares and life moves on. <br /> <br />I love satire and this is so good, not the authors best but much better than many if not all his imitators work.	2004-11-25

The pace of the book is good moving you on through the pages and the story which I won't divulge keeps you interested all the way through. <br /> <br />In today's world the characters are a little hard to swallow, Albert Campion the hero is a gentleman detective with no apparent source of income, Lugg the ex con manservant is corny, the evil Jack Havoc doesn't come across as especially evil by todays standards and Meg the heroine is a tad pathetic although she is supposed to be a modern woman.  The setting, a dank and fog bound London is also a little trite, but makes some of the twists and turns in the plot more believable. <br /> <br />That said if like me you enjoy the period and can mentally get in tune with the values and society of the time it's a really fun book to read.  I am a sucker for the twenties through to the end of the fifties and could read books like this one after the other.  <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who felt it would make a good movie, my only condition is that it would have to be in black and white.	2004-09-28

The state of course is for tourists and the pursuit of money, offering the complete England in a sanitised and scaled down version with first class accomodation and no need to travel around to see it. <br /> <br />During the course of the book Sir Jack has the upper hand, loses it through blackmail, is humiliated and then gains it again through bribery, all in hilarious fashion. <br /> <br />Barnes utilizes dry wit and satire most effectively to tell his tale, exposing powerful corporate heads as meglomaniacs, amoral and of course corrupt beings with no soul.  Nothing much new in that of course, except for the exceptional skill that Barnes employs doing so.   <br /> <br />However as you move through the book you begin to compare the modern high speed world with a now bygone simple age.  I found the comparison compelling and while I am not prepared to give up my computer and flat screen tv I confess to being a little wistful about a slower and simpler life. <br /> <br />I have no hesitation in recommending Mr Barnes, give him a try and I don't think you will regret it.	2004-09-28

Posing as a new member of the New Jersey Dragons Bolitar is asked to try find the team's missing superstar.  <br />As the book unfolds Marvin must face the demons of his old injury and the career that never was, mix it up with red brigade style terrorists and find out the truth about the absent star.  Ably assisted by his psychotic sidekick Win the end result is never in any real doubt.<br />The plot is interesting in a non taxing murder mystery way and holds it's own with that genre.  The difference from the pack is the pace at which the story moves and the wit of the dialogue.<br />I have become a big fan of the Marvin Bolitar series of books by Mr Corbin and find the mix of murder and wit intoxicating.	2004-07-15

Reading through this book everything seems to make logical sense to me, as a layman that is, however every book like this does seem to make sense in my eyes.  Having been on the diet for three weeks I can say for sure, that it is a lot less drastic than the Atkins diet I had tried in the past and failed to stay on.  I have lost around 10 pounds in three weeks which I am pretty happy with, but it was tough for the first 2 weeks when the regime is pretty strict, after that the program becomes more relaxed and for me, easier to stay on.  <br />For me personally the bigest plus is that unlike the Atkins diet, carbs are allowed after the initial two week period as long as they are taken in moderation and are the right sort of carbs.  For a carboholic like me the lack of carbs was the biggest single issue in the Atkins approach, and was the cause of my falling off the wagon.<br />Going forward I see this program as a change of lifestyle as opposed to a diet and my aim is to make that change.  Exercise becomes tougher as you get older, so the only alternative to eating right is to gradually get fatter, or it is for me.<br />The cover price of this book is a lot less than cosmetic surgery and it could give you a new body and lessen your chances of a heart attack.  What have you got to lose?	2004-06-02
US	45019767	R3M8HTDEFLOWBG	0679723250	525245685	The Postman Always Rings Twice	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Full of Despair	This slim novel was first publishedin 1934, it felt timeless to me and was finished in one sitting without pause.  The lead characters Frank and Cora are bleak and cold, totally lacking in redeeming qualities.  What makes the book so gripping to me is that the style of the writing, the sparse use of words and it's coldness exactly matches them.<br />The content is not suitable for young children and at one time Cain faced prosecution for this publication.  Today as the world has changed Postman would not have had the same impact in those terms, but as a literary work I think it is still stunning.<br />The plot is the murder of a small time diner owner by his wife and her drifter lover who comes to work for them and the destruction of what affection they had for each other through their own amoral natures.<br />Excellent!	2004-05-20
US	45019767	R724OXW4ZXCZA	0140185011	37294671	Travels with My Aunt	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Age is no measure of vitality	Travels With My Aunt is a fairly short amusing farce, that chronicles the impact of long lost Aunt Augusta coming back into the Henry's life.  <br />Aunt Augusta is very old (we never learn quite how old)but vital and lively dragging our initially reluctant hero half way around the world into a dark world of smuggling, South American Dictatorships and the CIA.  Middle Aged Henry in contrast in cautious, timid, bored and dull in the extreme.  A Bank Manager forced to retire early after a merger, Henry has thrown himself into a life of Daliah growing and visiting rather than worshiping at the local church, as his entertainment.  Initially shocked by his wild octaganerian Auntie, he develops a taste for new adventure and living life on the edge.<br />Travels With My Aunt is clearly not what you would call typical Greene, however it works because of the stark contrast between the characters.  Aunt Augusta is a wanton disgraceful character that captures your affection immediately, while Henry is a good but boring man that fails to penetrate the emotions beyond a kind of grudging pity.<br />Beyond the humor of his farce Greene challenges us to live, not merely exist and in doing so enjoy what little time we have.  He illustrates that if we achieve the goal of removing all risk in our lives to guarantee longevity, we have destroyed the essence of life and longevity is therefore undesirable.<br />In addition to the novel I have seen Travels With My Aunt as a very clever and entertaining stage play, which I would also recommend.<br />This is not the authors greatest work by any means, however it is hugely enjoyable, very funny and has a message that we all would do well to heed.  All in all a great little package that is well worth reading.	2003-12-09
US	45019767	R1EJB7GM2GAHJL	0375703861	363806782	White Teeth: A Novel	Books	4	3	6	N	N	Humor and so much more	White teeth is an excellent novel, mixing humor with a variety of underlying issues in society today.  In many ways it reminds me of works by Nick Hornby, but achieving significantly more depth. <br />I lived in London for several years and found the fears of both immigrant and native residents refreshingly realistic in the way they are portrayed in the book.  A cultural melting pot is often held up as the achievement of the modern age, where we trancend national and cultural boundaries.  But as Smith illustrates so well, it is not the intellectual escaping to the leafy suburbs who have to deal with the issues of living the ideal, but real people like Archie and Samad.<br />The book explores a great deal of heavy subject matter, but does so in a cloak of comic prose, which makes it no only palatable but hugely enjoyable.  <br />One reviewer gives this novel one star based on factual inaccuracies about India and Jamaica, he may well be right.  However I think he misses the point, this is a book about people and relationships not places.  The issues dealt with are very real for millions of people and the book is factual in it's account of how ordinary people struggle to deal with them as they go about their lives.<br />White Teeth has had a great deal of publicity and hype since it's publication.  Often this predjudices me against books or movies, but in this case I agree with the hype and can only recommend you read it.	2003-11-30

As an Englishman living and working around Athens Ohio, I found this novel really interesting as it provides a great insight into both the area and College life in the US. In addition I also found The Thirteen to be an entertaining and grippingly realistic story, something I cannot always say about the authors alter ego.  This book cleverly combines the journey of our freshman hero Five Lowry as he discovers the great mysteries of life, namely beer, women and commerce with a murder mystery.  No mean feat in my opinion!  My wife was somewhat grieved by my mistake, personally I was rather pleased and hope all my future errors turn out as happily.	2003-09-12

In A Taste for Death a tramp and a government minister are found in a church with their throats cut.  Dalgleish knew the minister slightly and felt a strong connection with him at their meetings.  As the case unfolds Dalgleish finds himself drawn in far more personally than he expected, which hampers his investigation to some extent.<br />Apart from the mystery, this novel explores the remnants of the british class system as it crumbles, the old guard represented by Lady Ursula hanging on for grim death and Kate Miskin determined to sweep away all vestiges of her upbringing and create a new life.  Neither character ultimately achieves their aim as nothing can remain unchanged, but as James aptly illustrates you also cannot just dismiss your past as though it did not take place.<br />James develops each character brilliantly as the story unfolds from the lonely spinster Miss Wharton who discovers the bodies, to Kate Miskin a newy assigned assistant to Dalgleish who's complicated personal life becomes tragically caught up in the case.<br />The book has been rated by other reviewers as both her best and one of her less noteworthy works.  I found it superb and rate it up there with her best.  Several reviewers also complain about the amount of detail the author goes into, in my opinion the detail is what brings the books to life, makes them believable and raises them above the mundane coffee table crime novel.<br />James achieves so much more than a mere who dunnit in her work, as she explores her complex characters insecurities, hang ups and emotions.  In addition she always explores some new facet of English society and leaves you with something to ponder long after the book is back on the shelf.  I feel James's work compares favourably with any contemporary &quot;serious novelist&quot; I have read recently and recommend her whole heartedly.	2003-08-31
US	45019767	R30SNE0SMIY8WG	0684801523	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Life Without Meaning	Firstly let me say I found this book unusually interesting and unlike many &quot;classics&quot; easy to read.  The tale is a romance, Jay Gatsby longs to be with Daisy, a girl from a different social world that he knew for a short period of time mamy years before.  On a different level the book describes the pointless existence of the idle rich and their dissatisfaction with their lot, although set in the 1920's it is still applicable today in many ways.  The characters Fitzgerald paints are shallow and undeserving, having achieved their wealth through inheritance or crime.  The author clearly is critical of his creations, but at the same time seems to be entranced by their mixture of style without substance.  My one dissapointment was the lack of any character I felt I could identify with or empathise with, even the narrator Nick Carroway came across to me as having few if any endearing qualities.  Probably just my personal prejudice in a novel rather than any literary requirement.	2003-07-15

Not a horror story but a grippping thriller with some supernatural moments Green Mile strays from King's normal output.  The green mile is the carpet running down death row, the book tells the story of it's inmates and in particular the giant John Coffey accused of raping and murdering two young girls.  The suspense and drama is spellbinding, the characters are so brilliant you feel as though you know them personally.  The book is narrated in the first person by Paul Edgecombe who is the supervisor of the cell block, the narration adds further to the sense of being there, being a spectator that makes you part of every event.  There is everything in this book:-life, death, love, hate, salvation, spirituality, sacrifice, morality and even God -everything that is important.  The Green Mile made me cry which no other book has ever done, I find myself thinking about it often, I also revisit it frequently which is very rare for me.  Given the quality of this novel I cannot believe the usual work King puts out, I guess money talks.  If I had to pick 5 books to take on a desert Island this would be one of them.  I just cannot praise it highly enough, the only disappointing thing is it eventually ends, even if you read it very slowly.	2003-05-28

Destiny takes him half way round the world and back again to accept a proposition to take the place and inheritance of a missing boy.  The story as so many of the time and genre are, is set in the midst of a middle class English country family.  The plot which I will not reveal is clever although not really a shock to the attentive reader, the writing is good and the characters are well developed.  The suprise for me was not the twist in the tale, but that the person you really get to like in the book is Brat who is the imposter and criminal.  Actually most of the characters are both likeable and comfortable which makes the readers journey through this book extremely pleasant if not gripping.  This was my introduction to Josephine Tey, it will certainly not be the last time I read her work.	2003-05-28

I found myself caught between the camps and unusually confused about what I thought about Mr Robinson's book.  I roared with laughter at parts, thought other sections mere juvenille bathroom humor and found other pieces thought provoking.  Woodpecker is a tale of the red headed romance between outlaw and sex crazed do gooding exiled princess, nothing strange about that you may say, if you do Woodpecker is right up your street.  The characters are weird but interesting, the story is mad but compelling in a non intellectual way.  Despite what others say I didn't find the meaning of life between it's covers, but does every novel have to explore the human condition.  Maybe read heads deserve having their own condition explored just once.  Personally I enjoyed all the men hating, tree hugging, caring groups at the festival being ridiculed, but that's just my own bias shining through.  The bottom line is that it was great fun to read, what more can you ask, should you ask more?	2003-05-28

The husband and wife experience different emotions relating to their loss and later recovery of their belongings.  For Mrs Ransome the events mark a new beginning, for Mr Ransome the effects are equally marked but significantly less pleasing.  A witty story that delves quietly into relationships and suppresion almost without you realizing it, worth the price on it's own.  The Lady in the Van is the documentary of a non comformist woman who lives in a van, or to be more precise several vans.  Over time she and her van migrate into the authors garden, where she constantly berates him despite his efforts to help her.  While extremely funny the story is quite graphic as it details our heroines struggle to fit into society and the frailty of the elderly when they have no support mechanism.  A superb blend of comedy and illumination, Bennett brings the unseen element of society under our noses and gently nudges our concience to acknowledge it.  Overall an excellent book well worth the investment in both money and time,	2003-05-21

The Deal Breaker might just change all that, it is a mystery set in modern times that for once is believable, the plot is cleverly thought out with the added bonus of making you laugh out loud from time to time.  Myron Bolitar an ex basketball player turned sports agent is drawn into this murder mystery to help his client and ex girlfriend.  Myron is tough, hansom, human and honest just what you are supposed to get in a hero, he also with the help of his less admirable cohort Win, delivers some of the funniest one liners ever written in a novel of this kind.  I read it on the recommendation of a rather frail looking old lady working in a bookstore, although dubious at the time I cannot be more pleased to have done so.  Try out a somewhat different but excellent approach to mystery writing.	2003-05-03

Pennyfather suffers almost every possible misfortune though his life, from being sent down from university for indecent behaviour to imprisonment for white slave trading.  Despite being innocent of all crime Paul allows misfortune and punishment to visit him almost unprotesting.  It is as though Waugh punishes him for his insignificance and his lack of substance and that is his true crime.  I am a huge fan of Waugh and find the satire and cutting wit outrageously funny, but beyond the humor there are more relevant messages for the society of his time and it's establishment figures.  I cannot recommend any of Waugh's novels highly enough and this, his first, is no exception.	2003-04-18

About a Boy is in some ways the male version of Bridget Jones Diary, exposing the shallow aspect of our nature.  The hero Will stumbles on single mothers as the ideal no strings, not ready for a relationship woman for him to prey on.  To this end he attends a single parent group meeting and invents a two year old son with hilarious results.  Will despite his cynical &quot;I am an island&quot; attitude, becomes ensnared and outsmarted by Marcus a 12 year old role model of uncool, that he meets through this sad little group.  Naturally as we have come to expect in such tales, underneath the public facade Will is found to our and his surprise to be much more than first we were led to believe.  Love, the non narcissic variety as in all classic cases of redemption, proves to be the catalyst in unearthing the real Will.  Nothing new in the storyline, but there is in the insight Hornby brings to the story.  Very funny novels rarely explore serious subjects such as suicide, loneliness, social rejection and the effects of parenting without understanding.  Hornby does dive into real world issues blending the comedy and the tragedy we all experience in a way few can.  The result is a subtle presentation of real life, funny and sad, each facet dependant on the others rather than standing alone.  An amusing but thought provoking package, an extremely well written package at that, a cut above the famous Diary for my money.	2003-04-18

Brand has a very similar style to Agatha Christie, she is a very accomplished writer in the genre in her own right and does not suffer in comparison with such elevated company.  I am reluctant to spell out too much of the plot other than to say it revolves around the Doctors, Nurses and Patients.  After all the point of mystery novel reading is trying to fathom out the real evidence from the red herrings yourself and I would hate to rob a potential reader of the fun of trying to solve the crime.  I didn't figure it out myself until it was laid out before me by the detective at the end of the book.  A worthwhile read from an excellent writer of murder mystery.	2003-02-04

Initially innocent he is corrupted by Henry Wotton his supposed friend, a devoutly immoral character who leads Dorian Gray into a truly sinful existance.<br />By chance Gray discovers his wish came true and the portrait not his own face is aged by his lifestyle, but when he sees the extent to which the image has been ravaged he wishes to recinde the wish. Wilde illustrates the ugly side of our natures and shows there is always a price to pay for it despite the public face presented to the world. Despite the dark message, the biting wit and sarcasm keep the reader amused as well as disturbed, leaving me with a somewhat guilty feeling if I should laugh while reading it (which I often did). The interesting thing is the author does not take a moral stance, maybe because of the life he led himself. Although Wild's only novel and not overly long, it is a truly great work. For the wit alone and a lifetimes worth of quotations it is essential reading.	2002-12-22

Lucia is the snobbish self appointed but undisputed Queen of everything cultural in this small rural english village.  However she finds herself challenged unintentionally by Olga Bracely a famous opera singer who takes up residence in the village.  As she fights for her throne the reader is witness to the malice, manipulation and backstabbing that is just under the surface in village life.  As in all good stories Lucia is all but dethrowned and then regains the upper hand once again.  The book is witty, full of interesting if somewhat strange characters and entertaining.  After first reading Queen Lucia I felt a little disapointed having heard Bentley described as being on a par with Wilde, Wodehouse and Coward.  I do not find this claimed level of wit and word smithing in Queen Lucia myself, however once I got past this disappointment I found myself both entertained by and fond of this novel.	2002-12-21

US	45019767	RQXZLEC9KWKA4	0879517344	716664432	Wilt	Books	5	22	24	N	N	Out Loud Funny	This is Sharp's best novel yet, the second detailing the life of Wilt a college lecturer and his severely disfunctional family. In what is basically a farce Sharpe's satire bites deep into every subject he touches, as Wilt comes under investigation by the police for drug dealing, infiltrates a US nuclear air base and has to use face cream to cool his burning uncontrolable penis.  If my description of this novel sounds manic, the reason is simple, the book is manic.  As an Englishman living in the US I am not sure if the humor travels well, but I hope my American friends can appreciate it, because this book is one of only three (all written by Tom) capable of making me laugh out loud wherever I am reading it (which can be most embarrasing). Try it and enjoy a different view of life and then be thankful you don't have to live Wilt's life.	2002-12-09

I can see why this is described as an early feminist work, however I did not see this excellent book in this light, no doubt due to being male. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for the quality of the writing, the excellent characterization, the period and the setting. However I found myself impatient at the slow pace of the heroines activity or should I say inactivity in moving toward her goals. To me this is the tale of someone who for the times in which she lived had everthing that was available to her but was unable to achieve satisfaction. In the story the heroine wants to reject even her children to achieve another life she is unable to define, she is confused and frustrated with tragic consequences. To my mind her sex is not the crux of the novel, the complexities of life and how individuals achieve or cannot achieve self fulfillment regardless of gender are the subject explored. Well worth reading regardless of your interpretation.	2002-09-26

I am now so glad I had an open mind and was prepared to read it for myself before jumping to ill considered conclusions.  The political perspective is presented, but in no way intrudes on the plot if you do not wish to involve yourself in it.  The story is of the struggle of two young architects to achieve their differing ambitions, which does not sound on the face of it particularly gripping.  However Rand through her excellent characterization and her depiction of the violence of Roark's struggle against convention and the contrast of the almost prostitutional nature of Keating's rise held me spellbound.  Treachery, violence, rejection, manipulation and dominance are just some of the themes Rand explores though this fantastic novel.  The politics behind the story, well I guess it's interesting if not compelling, but not nearly as interesting as the story.	2002-09-25

Not a novel in my view, more an artist using all his materials in a vast experiment, with the secondary agenda of shocking the establishment and sensibilities of his time.  Constantly changing style and using a truly massive vocabulary, often seemingly at random, he seems to be using his powers to toy with the reader.  There is no real story, no exploration of the human condition and yet it is truly amazing.  Like watching a world class gymnast who has total mastery of their body you are left feeling Joyce can do anything with our language.	2002-08-23

Descriptions of the chaos, despair and the ebbing belief of the troops are particularly compelling.  The dialogue was the problem, boring in the extreme and so unrealistic (unless conversation was really that different then)- It could have been amazing, but in the end it was a relief to finish the last page!	2001-12-07
US	45019767	R2TINZK1XI41I9	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Read it - You will not regret it!	Superbly written with a fine balance between the serious social issues and the light hearted view of our host.  &quot;To Kill a Mocking Bird&quot; is set in Alabama in the 1930's and is told through the eyes of &quot;Scout&quot; the young daughter of Atticus the single parent town lawyer.<br />The central tale of the book is that of Tom a negro falsely accused of raping a white girl, who despite his innocence is found guilty by his bigoted peers.  The secondary stories concern the struggles of Atticus to cope as a lone parent role model, the difficulty of being a child learning about concience and empathy as they grow up and the mysterious disappearance of Boo Radley.<br />The book builds slowly as it paints a vivid picture of the times, the characters and prevalant attitudes.  Once the scene was set this book built such a head of steam I was unable to put it down.  I read this book in one session, something I have never done before	2001-02-28
