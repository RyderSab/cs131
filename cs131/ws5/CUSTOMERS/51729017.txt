This first of three books by J.G. Betancourt attempts to serve as a prequel to the adventures of Corwin, by \\"introducing\\" readers to Oberon, Dworkin and the creation of the kingdom of Amber. The writing isn't quite up to Roger Zelazny's standards, but if that standard was easy to reach, Zelazny's work wouldn't really be all that impressive, would it? Betancourt's story suffers from the automatic predictability that comes with all prequels, just like the lack of suspense over what will happen to Anakin Skywalker in the third Star Wars movie. Although Betancourt telegraphs a lot of his plot twists, the story itself is fairly decent, and if you look at this as a regular fantasy story, it's a pretty good story. The book is certainly worth the cover price.	2005-03-03

I've been reading all of DC's comics since the mid 1960s, and this story brings back so many of DC's horror and mystery characters that every time I turned the page I found myself pleasantly surprised by another old friend. Those readers who are only familiar with the spandex crowd of heroes will not be able to enjoy the full flavor of this story, but the story builds to an outstanding conclusion that puts this story in the same league as the Swamp Thing \\"Gothic\\" series about the building battle between Heaven and Hell. By all means, buy it!!!	2005-02-27

It's a collection of the first half of a story. If the original comic series completed the story arc in the first 12 issues, then the TPB should have included all of those issues. Also, too many Amazon reviewers make more of the story than they probably should. This comic is well written and well illustrated, but it is definitely not on the same level as \\"Watchmen\\" or the Denny O'Neil/Neal Adams \\"Green Lantern/Green Arrow\\" stories of the early 1970s. It's just another comic book story, and this collection leaves the reader hanging at the end.	2005-02-27

Roger Zelazny has always been my favorite author, ever since I discovered the original Amber series sometime around 1977. I find most of his work to be consistently incredible, and \\"Italbar\\" is no exception. On the other hand, \\"A Dark Traveling\\" has always seemed to me to be substandard Zelazny. It's almost like he started to write what could have been a great story, then stopped after he jotted down some ideas and cleaned up a rough draft. The ending is definitely rushed. If you haven't read Roger Zelazny, you should read one of his other novels first. Once you see what the master did on a consistent basis, you'll have a better understanding of how this one story falls short.	2005-02-27

Understandably, George Lopez had a rotten childhood. In the first half or so of his autobiography, he constantly reiterates this point repeatedly, to the point where the reader stops learning anything new and, at least in my case, dreads reading the next paragraph. Toward the end of the book, Lopez switches from whining about his rotten childhood to constantly pointing out his belief that he is God's gift to Latinos. He also goes into great detail about his self-belief that he is a major talent as a golfer, as well as an infallible comedian. However, his \\"hard look\\" at his life never dwells on any of his faults or mistakes. He briefly mentions getting caught in school with pot, but says he only had it because someone gave it to him before school and he had nowhere else to put it. Lopez mentions a problem in his marriage that causes his wife to give up on him and kick him out of the house, but he softcoats the entire episode. (Reading between the lines, it appears he had at least one extra-marital fling, but he doesn't want to take a \\"long, hard look\\" at whatever the problem was.) Between his whining about his childhood and his acceptance as the greatest thing to ever happen to Latinos and comedy, I found George Lopez' book to read more like a psychiatric session for him than an open and honest revelation to his fans. If you must read this book, I strongly recommend checking it out from your local library before committing your own hard-earned money.	2005-02-26

William Shatner's \\"Captain's Blood\\" is actually a pretty good read. I was impressed with how he weaves various Star Trek characters in and out of the storyline. He goes out of his way not to slight the fans of any of the various TV shows, except for \\"Deep Space 9\\", I suppose. The story itself reads well, with Kirk and his multi-species son getting caught up in a pending civil war involving the two races that make up the Romulan Empire. The \\"bad guy\\" is telegraphed a mile off, and the story apparently necessitated Kirk's character making some extremely questionable decisions that, well, were obviously stupid when revealed in the book. I also have a hard time imagining Picard as a physical person, although I suppose he has to be presented this way if the character is going to try to hang at the same level as the eternally scrappy James T. Kirk. Overall, nothing in the book was any worse than what we all saw in the original TV show, and the two Enterprise captains appear practically the same as they did in the movie where Kirk died. Not a bad science fiction book, all things told.	2005-02-26

Some of the passages in this book are hilarious, but then there are just as many bizarre bits that seem to exist just to fill space. One bit is about an uncle telling his nephew to go to sleep while reminding the boy about previous acts of violence the uncle has committed in the boy's presence. This isn't satire, nor is it humor in any way. It's just foolish. Carlin is a comedic genius, one of the few truly great minds that expose the underbelly of every aspect of America, but parts of this book read like the man has taken a serious blow to the head. I gave this book three stars because Carlin's usual hilarious barbs about American life are always worth the price of admission. However, I couldn't finish reading the book, due to the alarming amount of pabulum the reader is forced to wade through to get to the good parts.	2005-02-26

I'm not, by nature, overly impressed with trivia books. I enjoy them at times, but I rarely consider them \\"page-turners\\", which is why they are often considered great choices for bathroom reading material. This collection is a welcome exception! History is a fascinating field, something more people need to realize but few can grasp after years of stale high school history lessons.

This sequel does not stand up to the original. I'm not a prude, but there was absolutely no need for the two graphic sex scenes between two of the main characters. They added nothing to the story, so I was left to gather this would be significant somehow in the third volume, if one is forthcoming. The other semi-graphic sex scene between two other main characters fit in well with the dominant member's character as portrayed in the graphic novels, but still did not need to be illustrated.<BR>     One of the group turns traitor, and strives to be a partner to the martian jelly-blobs attacking the earth. The martians appear to be trying to wipe out humanity. Why would anyone want to be the sole human left on the planet in this scenario? Just another example of little or no justification for adding a plot twist. I suppose the story's weakness lies in the limited amount of time the creators had to produce this sequel. Either way, I recommend to those who want to read the story, if you must buy it, wait for the softcover trade paperback. The hardcover is just not worth the money.	2004-02-03

Boy, was I mistaken! Obviously a collection of some earlier work, Bill Bryson shares much more of his personal thoughts and less of the local color that made the other two books such wonderful works. After reading half the book, I put it away. I got the impression that Bryson couldn't accept that the America of his childhood had evolved, and that he refused to find anything worth praising about mid-America today. It's really a shame, because his crankiness is often charming in his other works, but here it just makes me want to tell him to go back to England. If smalltown, USA is your thing, go find a book by Charles Kuralt. He knows how to make the middle states seem appealing.	2003-11-29

I'm not sure what I expected, but the book is entertaining and the characters are fairly amusing. I'm not a fan of Grisham's more well-known works, but if they aren't your preferred reading material, don't compare those with this book.

I expected this book to be about four baseball legends in the twilight of their lives, reflecting on their friendship while on a road-trip to see one of their dearest friends in his final hour. (Sounds like a chick flick!) That's nearly half the book, with the other half being the author's summaries of the four Red Sox legends' lives and careers. I'm a die-hard Red Sox fan and I read everything about them I can, but after a while all of the new books become repetitive. This book offers insight into the personal lives, thoughts and even childhoods of the four legends of Beantown baseball. This makes the book an invaluable addition to anyone's collection if you love baseball, team sports in general, or male bonding. (The author even squeezes in some fishing stories!) However, it's definitely a guy book, not the sort of thing you'll find on Oprah's book list.	2003-11-29

I believe his creativity diminished as his guaranteed sales numbers increased. As a lark, I read two of his Bachman books to see if the creative juices had returned for these stories. I was not disappointed. The story here involves children walking across America as a national contest, with the winner being set for life, and the losers having their lives ended. A bizarre and disturbing story, but well-written with fascinating characters. Anyone above the age of 10 will know who the winner will be after the first page, but all of the characters grab your attention and the way the boys interact will keep you reading. I strongly recommend this story.	2002-02-09

If you are looking for the price guide most stores will go by, subscribe to Beckett's magazine. If you want a book that will list all of the regional, food issue and oddball sets, buy this instead of Beckett. I collect Red Sox cards and had nearly 100 cards that I could not identify with the Beckett, even after combing through the book page by page. I bought this book because I needed info on minor league team sets, and to my delight was able to identify all but 3 card sets! This book was well worth the purchase! The only drawback is that the majority of minor league sets are identified by team name, manufacturer and number of cards in the set. I would like to know who was in each set so I can identify minor league cards of former Red Sox as managers, but the size of this book definitely prevents this. This book is huge compared to Beckett, a result of the additional sets and information provided. I'll stick with the Standard Catalog from now on, until someone produces a complete checklist of Red Sox cards!	2002-02-09

I came across this book as I was searching for something to read about Sacco and Vanzetti. Being from Brockton, Mass., the opening setting for the book, I was immediately intrigued. (The story opens in the Brockton V.A., where my mother worked for some years.) <BR>   Mr. Brennan does a great job of spinning his story. His depiction of growing up Irish in early 20th Century Boston created a world I could easily envision. In a rather original twist, his hero's adventures in WWI were not about blood and glory, but ducking out of work and doing whatever it takes to avoid danger. His tales of bootlegging, of family tension, and of struggling with the decision to do the right thing, regardless of the cost... This was a fantastic read and I look forward to future efforts.<BR>   The only problem I had with the book is that Mr. Brennan stated he wrote it to fan the flames of public outcry to overturn the convictions of Sacco and Vanzetti. These two people do not appear in the book until it is half over. Having read the author's intent before buying the book, it kept nagging at the back of my mind until the characters finally appeared. The story focuses on Vanzetti, and presents a rather weak case for his innocence. The main arguement seems to be that Vanzetti was too nice, too self-educated and too peaceful a man to commit murder. Mr. Brennan presents his view that almost everyone wanted these men to be found guilty and ignored evidence that would have vindicated them. While this is certainly possible, it doesn't mean that Sacco and Vanzetti didn't do the crime. The potential evidence presented in the second half makes a weak arguement for reopening the case.<BR>   As I've said, it's a great read. It was not the story I expected, but it was definitely a story worth reading.	2002-01-22

I normally dislike pure fantasy books, where the author can change &quot;the rules&quot; whenever he or she feels like it.
