Regarding the book's strengths and weaknesses: for about 2/3 of the story I was fascinated and puzzled.  The solution, however, does not hold up well when I look back over the book from the end.  For one thing, given the solution, the killer acted very irrationally, which is never satisfying.  In addition, I think the pacing of the story was off -- too many facts emerged in the last few pages, in an Agatha Christie-like, rabbit-out-of-a-hat manner.  Many of these late-discovered facts should have been known to the characters sooner, and their ignorance makes the ending more strained.	2005-09-15

They are like, well, the airy, fluffy yeast doughnuts that you love to eat but don't last, and so similar to each other that you can't remember the story.  Well, I couldnt do it and yesterday \\"11\\" arrived in the mail and I finished it before work this morning.  See, that's the problem.  They don't last.  That said, I was laughing so hard last night that I kept my husband awake. And as a big bonus, Steph started to change a little bit. (One of my gripes is that she never seems to gain more depth).  She tries a few different things, ending up working for Ranger as a researcher (I hope this continues, it seems as though it could take her in some interesting directions).  She thinks a bit about her life.  She defends herself and doesn't screw it up (well, not all the time).  There is even a plot that is kind of a mystery.  I still would like to see Stephanie find something that she is at least moderately interested in doing, and I will keep hoping.....	2005-08-17

But I could barely get through a third of it.  There is a huge amount of pretentious descriptions of everyone's designer clothing.  Who cares?  Not only that, but Molly herself could certainly not afford the stuff she wears on a reporter's salary (and frankly, I wouldn't respect her for wasting any money on it).  I found the endless label-talk both distracting and pretentious.   Beyond that, I thought the dialogue and relationships seemed very forced and awkward.  With the weight of all this, the murder couldn't hold my interest.	2005-08-09

But I had a hard time finishing it.  <br />First, I found March to be seriously irritating.  Despite his constant movement, he struck me as basically passive; I kept wanting to say something like \\"get over it\\".  Of course, this criticism is also a testimonial at how well Mr. Spiegelman delineated his character, I lose interest in a well written character who makes me impatient.  The same can be said for March's girlfriend, Jane.  Moving on...March's client is so dislikeable that I was constantly wondering why March was still working on the project, even after she fires him AND he understands that the case may be endangering people dear to him (I understand persistence, but to continue when your loved ones are threatened with physical harm, and the case is hardly of earthshattering importance anyway?)  One of the consequences for me of this disbelief and irritation was that I didn't care who or what was responsible  - I just lost interest.  Some of this may also be attributable to the fact that the usual clue to clue journey of the detective structure was mostly missing.  Instead, it was a lot of dead ends and a Big Revelation.	2005-07-27

The characters tend to seem shallow and cookie-cutter.  I started \\"Wrongful Death\\" expecting it to follow this pattern, but I was pulled into it immediately.  Others have described the plot; I just want to say that if you enjoy fully filled-out charcters and a plot out of the ordinary, try this one.  I can't understand why Kerr is not more well-known.	2005-07-03

The bigger issue is that she has no real personality, she is just an object of other people's love which, as far as I can tell, she does nothing to merit.  While I enjoy the email format, I think it exacerbates the problem of character development and here, I think the only character that seems like a person (although a fantasy person) is Jack. Also found th eending not at all believable.	2005-06-23

(It only took a few hourse to read). Also, now that I have read two of them, I think Stoss should \\"deepen\\" the texture a bit; build characters more, create more depth overall.  The books feel a little bit outline-ish to me.  No more so than Zelazny, but  I always wanted more from him, too.  (a little bit of Neal Stephenson would be good).

Other reviewers have described the plot; I will just say that it was pleasurably twisty.  About a third of the way through the book I thought the solution was obvious, and I was disappointed, but I was wrong! <br />A minor flaw is that the book ended too abruptly.  It needed a little more of a wind-down. <br />SPOILER ALERT!  <br />There is a hint toward the end of the book that Alex and Allison may be heading for a split and Robin may reappear...Mr Kellerman, if you read these reviews, DON'T DO IT.  While one criticism I would level at all of the Alex D. books is that the two female love interests do not have very well-developed characters, as far as they go, Allison is preferable.  Robin is kind on whiney.	2005-05-27

As best I can tell from the extensive endnotes, the author did a phenomenal research job, and then (from my point of view) turned his work into fiction.  Instead of presenting us with the facts (fascinating in themselves) the author presents everything \\"through the eyes\\" of the participants, pretenting to be in their thoughts, and using quotation marks with the abandon of a novelist.  We all know that this is just plain made up, but by using this form of presentation, the author blurs the distinction between fact and fiction.  He DOESN'T know what these people were thinking, and making it up implies that he does; requiring me to search the footnotes at the end of each sentence -- what is true and what is made up? For example, on the first page we follow Ken Lay's thoughts as he is driven to work -- the footnote shows us the source for what kind of car it was -- but of course no reference for Lay's thoughts (and even if Lay had said what he was thinking, we have know knowledge that he told the truth).  Accordingly, although the book is entertaining, I demote it to a \\"2\\" for horrendously bad journalistic practice.	2005-05-23

The PW description seduced me into thinking it was a story about journalist investigating mysterious lights.  It isn't.  The lights serve only to get Our Hero to the place where he meets cliched smart beautiful librarian, so that he can ultimately embrace the charms of rural life. <br /> <br />Now, just about every romance formula is done over and over, and if it is done well, I enjoy it over and over.  I did not think this was done well.  The characters were all surface; there was no apparent reason for Hero to fall for this particular woman or she for him (except that pickings are slim in a very small town). And it struck me as being purely anti-moderniist/technological -- a tiny backwater town equated with all that is good.  (the concomitant bad thinks about the small town did not figure in).  On the whole, I would rate this similarly to a Danielle Steele, which is negative to me but of course, in the eyes of many, a high compliment.	2005-05-12

The \\"conflicts\\" keeping the characters apart were unconvincing -- I kept thinking, \\"no one would act that way\\".  This made it hard to sympathize with their plight.  Similarly, the roadblocks in our hero's way -- such as being considered a suspect -- rested on completely irrational behavior by all (not that that's unbelievable for government agents, but still). The ultimate resolution of the \\"mystery\\" was a letdown.   The info about the Big Hurrican itself was interesting.	2005-05-12

What struck another reviewer as a negative -- how in the dark the reporters were about what they were writings about -- struck me as well, for a different reason, namely, how worrisome it is that things that have such a gigantic effect on the market's perception of the company can be so hard to find out about. And, as that reviewer pointed out, it highlights how little the media who write about the \\"business world\\" really know about the details. (Of course, anyone who has ever read a news story about a company they work for is aware of this).   <br />I enjoyed following the reporters' quest to find things out - the \\"reporter as information hero\\" approach. It reminded me of \\"All the President's Men\\" and the days when I respected the press as the natural adversaries of bovernment / big business, which is always stonewalling.  I also found the book to be much more intelligently written than many of the other books on the subject.  I also agree with the reviewer who would have liked to see more discussion of What it All Means, although it's easy to see why the authors would have regarded that subject as something no one is interested in.	2005-01-11

I really like some of DeMille's books, and was looking forward to this.  I expected to read something inventive built around flight 800.  Instead, he wrote the most obvious conspiracy theory.  Not only does this lack the suspense of how it turns out, but the journey itself doesn't engage, as it does in some \\"airline crash\\" thrillers where the thrill is in the \\"how\\" it happened.  For me, a big disappointment.	2004-11-29

I was looking for an intelligent, not dumbed-down synthesis.  Certainly the book is intelligent, well researched, apparently encyclopedic.  It is an excellent reference.  What it is NOT (at least for me) is a book to read through.  This is why:  (1) I found the retention of the notes in the middle of the text very distracting.  Although I am sure you can get used to it, it really breaks up the continuity between sentences.  The fact that the book IS so very well noted aggravates the problem of reading through the notes in the text.  (2) A great deal of knowledge about skeletal anatomy is assumed.  Although I am reasonably well-read, I do not know the names of all of the the skeletal parts and the potential medical abnormalities, which made parts of the book read like a foreign language.  A glossary would have been helpful to me. (3) The information felt very \\"episodic\\" to me -- not much more than a paragraph on any topic.  This made it hard to stay engaged, because each topic was over just as I was becoming interested. <br /> <br />None of the foregoing should matter if what you are looking for is a reference to go to - like an encyclopedia - for direction.  My issues were with the disconnect between what I wanted (an intelligent reading experience) and what I now think is the book's purpose.	2004-10-28

But will definitely look for more. <br />Problems: <br />(1) grammar:  there were a lot of jolting dangling participles.  Please have a good editor eliminate these next time!  I do not consider this trivial, because the flow of the narrative is badly interrupted by these things. <br />(2)awkwardness:  In places, there is a failure to deal with details that harms the \\"genuineness\\" of the atmosphere.  It nagged at me that Emma was not in school.  You don't just keep kids out of school for months on end.  Was it summer? I couldn't find a season reference anywhere. <br />(3) the so-called \\"teasing\\" between the heroine and randall.  These exchanges \\"read\\" to me as hostile and dismissive.  If I were a dealer and someone constantly called me a rip-off artist, I don't think I would view it as teasing.

Also, it is rare that an author uses the device -- used very very well here -- of looking at the same event in light of one or more different facts and creating an entirely different scenario.  That kind of reinterpretation is central to this book and makes it fascinating, because you think you know something and then the implications of the few facts are resifted into another scenario.	2004-09-13

The \\"hook\\" of a body that looks just like the heroine, Maura, is a good one, and I expected to explore more of the depths of Maura's background.  However, both the explanation of the \\"twin\\" and the emotional resonance are not satisfying; the treatment of both seems to be superficial.  Beyond this, the investigation of the crime and tracking of the killer had little challenge to it.  And to me, the ending was a letdown	2004-08-22

I like the fact that Stephanie and even Lula seem to be getting a littloe more competent, while still playing &quot;screwball&quot; roles.  But I agree tht the series has reached a point where it needs more.  It's time we got more of a real plot and more depth to the characters.  I disagree with the criticism that the characters are actually regressing; I think we are learning more about the real characters of the cardboard cutouts (Steph's need for independence, Joe's Italian chauvinism)but I no longer feel like it's enough.  I want something more serious to happen -- for example, Ranger disappears (even the RangeMen are worried) and Steph goes looking for him to save him, encountering mid-East terrorists and so forth.  In sum, although Ten Big Ones didn't evidence much grown of Evanovich's writing skills, I will still read the next one.	2004-06-26

I agree with other reviewers that the character of Kate is interesting and feels &quot;real&quot;, and I enjoyed the book enough to read others in the series.  However, I thought the ending was very abrupt and not really satisfying.  I think too much was left to the reader to infer -- I never did really understand the fate of the original corpse.  I think the strands should have been tied up a little more.  I agree with the reviewer who didn't understand Kate's relationship with her boss, or the boss himself, for that matter.  He spent the book being moody, which was attributed to having an awful wife -- but this is 2004 -- it is hard to believe that a man with no children would stay with a wife so (apparently) hostile and unsympathetic.  I wanted to slap him.  Finally, although I read a lot of books by british authors, I am absolutely stumped by the meaning of the term &quot;Gaffer&quot;.

Given the large number of books being written in this genre, I would put this one way at the bottom of the list.  Saying the characters are \\"unrealistic\\" just doesn't give the flavor - after all, none of these books are really realistic, and if we can identify with the characters, we don't care.  But here is mean \\"so far off the map that they aren't even realistic for a chick lit romance\\" and the plot too preposterous for suspension of disbelief.  I was irrevocably turned off after two pages of reading about Becca's great life -- come ON, even Warren Buffet doesn't live that life, and at 31 or so, a highly successful banker/investment adviser/FEMALE is still going to have many bosses above her and much less power.  And that kind of unrealism to that degree, is a real turn-off for me. (Plus, it made her unlikeable in her invinceability).  I also agree that the idea that some rich guy today would marry at his mama's bidding is ludicrous, and if there were such a person, he would be a candidate for serious psychiatric counseling.	2004-06-10

I think it just felt to formulaic, without enough charm in the writing to make me not mind.  Other readers, obviously, differ. I agree with the reviewer who said that one just couldn't believe that Bailey would be involved with these people (although there WAS some motivation for becoming re-involved) and the people were too uninteresting to care about.

Another reviewer criticized it for being too long, too complicated, and too demanding of the reader.  Just the sort of review to send me directly to the book, if i hadn't already read it. So yes, if you like books that are short, have big print, and leave you feeling like you just ate cotton candy, this is not for you.  I, however, love books that are long and complex.  I loved the movie industry history, I loved the LA history, I enjoyed the main character. She needs to have a more fully-formed character, but the beginnings are there, I think.  I did find the interaction of Ann with her father and sister to be a bit jarring; I 'm not sure whether it was because his full-blown awfulness didn't seem to fit with the rest of the characters or whether he seemed like an afterthought.  But still, a great book.	2004-06-08

In fact, I read a great many of these, and this is one of the best -- entertaining without being too strained. As other reviewers have noted, the plot involves writer Cece Caruso, writing a biography of Erle Stanley Gardner and suffering writer's block.  Reading old correspondence leads her to a convicted murderer who asked for Gardner's help decades ago and who is still in jail.  Cece decides to solve the crime.<br />Following this plot obviously involves considerable suspension of disbelief, but the story moves along at a good clip with entertaining episodes and all the right ingredients -- an old mystery, a locked box, wacky best friend, and so forth.  I highly recommend it.	2004-05-14

This book isn't bad, but it's not exceptional either.  Beyond that, the most useful thing I can say, probably, is that it is more of a &quot;coming of age&quot; story than a &quot;treasure hunt&quot; story.  It reminds me more of &quot;A Separate Piece&quot; than &quot;the Da Vinci Code.&quot;  While there is a lot about the way the mystery book has affected the narrator, his father, his friends, etc. the actual &quot;mystery&quot; of the book itself is secondary to these relationships and characters.  In fact, I could not make myself care about the mystery book.  To put my views in context, I am not much of a &quot;da Vinci Code&quot; fan either -- I think it goes too far in the other direction with cardboard characters and awkward dialogue.  If you like mysteries about art and art history, or codes, read the &quot;jonathan and flavia&quot; mysteries of Iain Pears or &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson.	2004-05-13

That said, I agree that many of the characters are underdeveloped, although I did think Grace was well done.  My personal biggest complaint was that the REALLY BAD bad guy was so much a cardboard stereotype.

It is painless reading, but also, I think, too superficial.  There is not enough depth to the plot or the character interactions.  I feel as though, instead of using each book to add depth to his characters, White is relying on us knowing them from the prior books.  I find this unsatisfying.  Still, it was not a BAD book, just too short and lazy.	2004-02-17

But that is not the only issue here.  First, the subject is supposed to be investigating corporate fraud.  As another reviewer noted, however, the only subject covered is computer techniques.  The actual tracking of the fraud never really appears in any detail.  I was expecting a tale of actual processes and insights into actual crimes; however, the book stops short at the recovery of information from computers.  The interesting part would be how one piece of info leads to another and suggests other places to look.  But nothing is looked at that closely, so the excitement is lost.  I also agree with the other reviewer that the relevance of the dog-mauling case is tangential at best.  Even in chapters with strong subject matter, such as the investigation of the swiss handling of jewish acounts, the prose is lifeless and conclusory; it does not follow the trail of the adventure.	2004-02-14

Also (call me picky) it was marred by obvious total lack of proofreading -- for example, the colorado ski town was called &quot;Vale&quot; rather than &quot;Vail&quot; and the past tense of &quot;broadcast&quot; was &quot;broadcasted&quot;.  These things may not bother some people, but to me it indicates that no one cared enough even to proofread the book.	2004-02-07

It was a little thin -- both in the sense that it had big print and few pages and also in the sense that I thought the skeleton could have been better filled out.  This is particularly apparent toward the end of the book, where there are loose ends relating both to plot and character.  I thought Smith did do a creditable job of making the heroine sympathetic despite her mistakes; just wish the promise of the book had been better fultilled.	2004-01-27

As other reviewers have said, the atmosphere is great.  And, also as other reviewers have said, the plot is not very significant.  What you get with Furst is:  good atmosphere and a likeable hero, who, however, is pretty much the same in each book.  Personally, I would would like the books to have a bit more character and plot development, so that it doesn't seem as though the events and characters are basically interchangeable; but the books are entertaining nonetheless.	2003-11-04

After all, it is a big subject.  The book is the best explanation I've yet seen of the transformation of the professions into businesses like any other, and the absolute dichotomy between what the public thinks auditors do and what the auditors actually do.  Unfortunately, I think what one takes away from this is: don't buy stocks, you can't know what's going on with them.  Although &quot;Unaccountable&quot; makes the accounting profession look bad, absent a complete restructuring fo the financial markets accountants will continue to work to please the management rather than the investors, because that is the only way the accountants can survive.  The same is true for lawyers, bankers, and rating agencies.	2003-10-12

The unfortunate side effect is that at times I didn't want to keep reading.  I disliked Lena for her self-destructiveness and hostility, but I actually think that the character is well drawn and developed.  I also disliked Jeffrey and can't understand why Sara tolerates him -- he strikes me as being seriously violent and a jumper to conclusions.  As to the book as a whole, the solution was not very satisfying, especially as regards Sara's sister Tessa; I would have liked a more interesting, less contrived solution.  Also I think the brutality was excessive.	2003-09-21

I actually have not read this book, but have been dissuaded from doing so by the prior reviews.  To future readers of the reviews, I ask: what does the fact that there really WERE soviet spies have to do with McCarthy?

Bubbles is a similar character type to Stephanie Plum and fun to read about.  I have one big HOWEVER (which also applies to Stephanie): why does the author want to describe her as dumb?  Obviously, she isn't, and obviously, the author isn't; and obviously, she would be boring if she were really dumb.  So why tell us that she barely made it out of high school and flunked every course but one at the community college?  A character like Bubbles would really be ashamed of such a thing, unless it was explainable by deep post divorce depression, or revenge or something.  In short, I am not dumb, the author is not dumb, the reader is not dumb, why try to paint the character as dumb?	2003-05-20

When I asked myself &quot;what is this book about&quot; I did not have an answer.

It is well written, and Cruver manages to convey the essence of the businesses and the misdeeds of personnel without becoming bogged down in fact, law, and accounting rules.  This is not a book for the reader intent on following the details of those rules and the precise nature of the corporate misdeeds.

Although I liked the book well enough, I came away feeling that there was something missing.  None of the characters, including Gregory himself, caught my interest enough to care what happened. Gregory is going through a mid-life crisis here, and I felt like advising him to give it up and find a new profession.  <br />If you want to know about the plot -- Gregory finds himself acting as therapist to an FBI agent who was instrumental in the release of a death row prisoner based on DNA evidence, and also as therapist to the released prisoner.  Many in the law enforcement community are angry about the release, despite the evidence.  As violence erupts, things told to Gregory in therapy gives him an information advantage over his cop friend Sam Purdy, but he is bound by his confidentiality obligations. <br />One small detail that really bothered me, because if seems somehow disrespectful -- none of the people who prepared this book for print bothered to check the name of the bombed federal building in Oklahoma City , which is referred to in the book as the \\"murrow\\" building rather than the \\"Murrah\\" building.

First -- there was no real plot, unless a New Guy is supposed to qualify.  the whole book is about the trial that follows the last book.  Nothing new or surprising happens at the trial.  this is the biggest flaw -- the whole book is just an epilogue<br />Second:  things that should be Startling Developments are  a letdown.  Much is made of the fact that the wife of the killer of Sally's father has a dying wish to see her, but when we find out why, the why leads nowhere.  it's a big \\"so??\\"  This is just one example.<br />Third: you don't have to be a trial lawyer to find the courtroom stuff annoying -- you learn this much just from watching Law & Order -- which is, that all that defamatory stuff about Sally could have been objected to by the defense.  So I found it annoying.<br />I came away with the impression that van Wormer's books are heading more and more away from mystery/suspense and closer to superficial romances.	2002-12-05

I am not exactly sure why; maybe just to be reminded not to become complacent about it.  This one juxtaposes chapters describing the plot with chapters focused on the bios of individual victims, a technique that, I think, makes the tragedy more vivid than massing victims in to a big number.  I learned a few new things about the plot, a lot of new things about some of the heroism of the victims and the minutes before the collapse.  In contrast to the previous reviewer, I did not think the approach was clinical; if anything, I thought the writing was a big overwrought in places.

I hated it.  To be fair, in general i hate books where the device to explain an otherwise unbelievable set of characters is: one or more of them is a psychopath, so nothing needs to be explained, he or she is \\"evil\\" and could do anything.   In addition, the characters are cardboard, the plot, such as it is , is dumb, and the most sympathetic character is a fish.	2002-07-19

The hero's disillusionment was vivid without being so bad as to make his character a chore to follow; the plot was well crafted. i didn't figure out what was going on until very near the end; and best of all, when i did find out, it made sense, unlike a lot of books whose endings may be surprising but have little connection to what went before.<BR>   Basically, the hero (aptly described by one character as \\"Dudley Doright\\") who has become a political outcast, is asked to preside over and rubber stamp a justice Dept. investigation. Depressed enough that he thinks he is willing to do just that in exchange for a new job far away from D.C., he quickly discovers that there is more to the case than meets the eye, and off he rides (figuratively).  my only real quibble is with the end, which is in my view unrealistically happy.	2002-07-16

The author succeeds in doing just that.  We have a &quot;cast of characters&quot; -- notables and non-notables -- aboard the Lusitania, as it makes its last voyage.  When, as we know it will, the ship sinks, we are anxious to know what happened to the people we &quot;knew&quot;.  The author also manages to set the stage with historical background of the development of submarines and the context of the war, and the political scene, as well as to follow the political repercussions and the investigation into the sinking.  All in all, a page-turner, well researched (with tons of footnotes, just the way i like it).  The big surprise to me was how long it took rescuers to get to the ship, which was relativel close to shore.	2002-07-02

This one, plus some of marian keyes, are among the few i have enjoyed. <br />First, i laughed a lot, always a recommendation.<BR>Second, despite how much i enjoyed Bridget Jones, i was pleased to meet a heroine who did not spend most of her time drinking and sitting in pubs.  I thought the eating disorder was introduced very deftly, and was explored in a way both entertaining and meaningful at the same time.  <br />Although i was in places annoyed at natalie for being too passive, on the whole i found her to be a sympathetic heroine, well worth sticking with.  I also enjoyed the supporting characters.<br />What i liked best, however, was the &quot;take a deep breath, step back, and look at your life&quot; story.  The point is not so much that natalie doesn't eat (hard for me, and probably for many, to understand) but that she doesn't even realize where her life is leading her until something forces her to step back.  Having been through similar periods, i found maxted's insight rewarding.  One reviewer said that taking up the Pilates exercise program is a major life change for natalie; but that misses the point, which is, that a step back and reevaluation is an important part of life.	2002-06-11

Certainly this book is way far above the standard paperback romance.  I also agree with the reviewer that found characterizations somewhat shallow.  I enjoyed the plot, the book was fast paced; it did not seem really predictable as i was going along. on the other hand, the legendary ring is not very convincing as a subject for all of the action, and the plot was perhaps a bit too coincidental.

I like disaster books generally; this one was more satisfying than most. It does not gloss over the detail; rather the interest is in the detail of how crash investigators work, trying to eliminate various theories to find the truth.

The plot and characters are unconvincing --just sketches. the solution to the mystery did not seem credible to me. and the hero was so obnoxious in the first 50 pages that his shift in attitude was itself not very believable.  Maybe it's one of those &quot;girl&quot; things, but i am not enamored of characters who seem to think their mission in life is to alienate the maximum number of people by boorish behavior.

Most of what was new was about the lives of the terrorists, reconstructed from police work.  Considering how recently the events occurred, i think the authors did a fairly good job.  My criticisms may reflect information not available to them , rather than any fault of theirs.  But still, two of what seem like big questions to me are not addressed at all, or dismissed in a sentence:  was any effort made to get to all the people trapped on the roof of the north tower? the book talks about calls to 911 from those poor people, but does not reflect anyone acting on them or even trying to reassure them. The book mentions in passing that the roof was too smokey for helicopters, but surely someone should have been trying?  Also, where were the engineers?  Shouldn't someone have been considering how great the risk was of sending the firefighters in? Wasn't there a consultant somewhere who should have been thinking: maybe we shouldn't send more people in?  These are questions that i hope for answers to each time i open a 9/11 book ; so far i have not found any.  However, that does not detract from the fact that the authors did a good job ordering the information, especially tracing the hijackers.	2002-04-05

This book is a good exemplar of the truism that porn is just plain boring.  the only thing distinguisning the beings merry has sex with from each other is the description of their bodies.

This is not it, maybe because it was an early book? The characters don't make sense, particularly sharon's relationship with a cop, who is first nasty (in a way that i would consider &quot;over the top&quot; for teasing) and later becomes just as inexplicably friendly.  This was very jarring for the reader.  I kept wondering why the beneficiary of the will, rather than the executor, was making legal decisions about the estate -- doesn't everyone know that there has to be an executor?   this mistake bothered me.  Regarding the actual antiques, while I don't really know, I find it hard to believe that business is conducted in the way described.  All in all, pretty unpolished.	2002-01-28

The description of the front seemed very alive (not that I have any real life experience to compare it to).

But for me it was to jarring, reading a book with characters so very different and not-admirable.  Moreover, I find it impossible to believe that a 28 year old, at least attractive woman, who is also a doctor (let alone all the other women who keep this business going), would pay for sex.  And then, towards the end of the book, this woman who apparently was alienated enough to pay for sex decides that she needs to have a real relationship with the male prostitute.  I just don't believe it.  I also am not charmed by the male prostitute himself, who is supposed to be sympathetic despite his profession.  Again, i don't believe it.  Further, I agree with the reviewer that found the language virtually impenetrable; often i could not figure out what was happening. I stopped reading Lovejoy books because they became too desolate for me (couldn't Lovejoy be at least respectable enough to live a halfway normal life in a house?.  This is far more so.	2001-10-23

The actual writing deserves better than 2 stars, although it's of the terse, partial sentence macho/cool style.  The problem is that i dislike the hero.  We are supposed to think he's a Good Guy (are we?) because he keeps after the story, despite pressure from the ubiquitous Evil Rich Guy and the money-grubbing stooges that run the newspaper and (gasp!) would actually like to make money rather than subsidize ted's curiosity.  But -- all of us have to make a living, why should he be exempt?  More seriously, he drops his sort-of girlfriend because she actually wants him to interact with her, be interested in her kid, and do other basic things generally thought by most humans to be natural and positive in a relationship, and instead takes up with - -  could it be any worse?? -- an INTERN at his own newspaper.  No wonder they fired him, he deserves it.  and he picks on his editor, who spends a lot of time trying to defend him to management, with zero gratitude from ted.  I would hate to think that men in general think ted is a likeable fellow.  Finally, the villain is not believable.	2001-10-18

A murder, which ultimately turns out to have political connections, is interspersed, and held my interest, but the murder is really subsidiary to the philosophical questions -- who, if anyone, is a &quot;good&quot; german? or for that matter, a &quot;good&quot; american or russian?  <BR>I loved this book for its character development and thoughtfulness.

On the downside, however, some of her behavior in this book does not make human sense -- it seem outright nutty.

I thought the mining detail was one of the most interesting facets of the book, not at all hard to follow, and added immensely to my enjoyment of the book.  Similarly, i was delighted with the non-formulaic nature of the plot; it is intriguing not to be able to unravel the whole thing on page 10 or so.  I also enjoyed the digression into the character of the missing geologist and his relationship with his wife.  For me, the most unconvincing and flattest part of the book is Em's relationship with Ray, her ostensible love interest.  Maybe he will develop some in later books, but I just could not believe that this woman could have reached the point of thinking about marrying someone who wants her to abandon the intellectual side of her nature.  Nor am i convinced by Em's repeated soul-searching and rejection of requests to helf the FBI.  This woman could not be this un-self-aware.	2001-09-04

The main character, Reb, is a stuntman, making his ability to survive in the face of evil pursuers easier to swallow. The historical puzzle is extremely well done. On the down side, i wish the book had been a little bit &quot;denser.&quot; The book moves at the speed of a TV show rather than what i expect of a book, and it is clear that the author, whose writing is very good, could produce a less sketchy effort. I hope he does, it would be a treat. A couple of minor complaints: the heroine, though smart, is utterly helpless -- too much so even to pick up a gun that is lying on the floor in order to save herself and the hero. Only a total dingbat would be as unfailingly unable to help herself. Mr. West! pay attention and fix this next time. Also, anyone reading the book cannot but marvel at the fact that people are carrying around genuine, 500-year-old manuscript pages that are brittle, fragile, and very valuable when there ia a kinko's on every corner. Readers with an interest in art, surely a big part of the audience for this book, will cringe constantly at the thought of what is happening to these papers. Maybe the idea of copies is tough on the plot, but pretending that xerox machines do not exist doesn't solve it. But this is a small point; overall i would highly recommend this book.	2001-08-28

I don't know much about mummification technique, and would like to know more, as well as more about the biotech techniques currently being used to study mummies.  This book gave me a bit of new info, but it is general in nature and does not cover any subject in much depth.  Thus, interspersed with paragraphs about discoveries are discussions of the morality of examining mummies, colorful bios of people in the mummy business, detours into mummy collectors and Resurrection men, etc.  If that kind of pleasant, meandering survey is what you are looking for, for a weekend's entertainment, this book is very good.

I enjoyed it, although i also agree with the idea that it's a bit rambling.  The sample script beginning at the end of the book, critiqued by other writers, was probably the most interesting part of the book because of the insight it provides to writers' approaches.

In addition, the author uses way too many actual historical figures, which i think highlights the awkward writing, because i found myself thinking, &quot;that person wouldn't talk like that, or think like that.  also, the plot was, well, trite.  not recommended	2001-05-17

Instead, I got a real pleasure that i carried around until i had finished it (same day I started).  The characters are interesting and a little eccentric, and eccentric without being stupid.  The plot is good, but really secondary to the interplay of the charcters.  First thing this morning i logged on to order the rest of Ms. Moseley's books.  I highly recommend this book	2001-05-14

The characters are very one-dimensional; it was almost impossible to tell them apart.  Even the heroine had no real personality but was just a vehicle around which the plot revolved.  The plot itself held no surprises:  the murderer could have been anybody, there was no real thread to discovery and understanding. It was more like a one hour tv show than a book.	2001-05-10

I would like to have seen a little more analysis of the weaknesses in the technique (mainly what author calls the &quot;soft tissues,&quot; and possible approaches to increasing accuracy, or alternative versions of the same skull with soft tissue variations). this is a quibble, though.	2001-04-09

I was hoping for a much more detailed work that would specify particular types of antiques (e.g. ceramics, furniture), and, even better, special periods or makers (e.g., moorcroft, doulton, arts&amp; crafts). this book really didn't tell me any more than my eyewitness guide	2001-04-09

It's great if that is what you are looking for, but I would have liked a little more  depth.  The question that is most interesting to me is ignored:  how did people propagate and hybridize the tulips?  I am a gardener myself, and i would love to know the answer to this question.  Every time the book says &quot;...and soon there were dozens of tulip gardens...&quot; i got frustrated.	2001-01-31

A lot happens, the pages turn, one wonders what it going on.  My one reservation is that, as the bodies pile up, the book wants us to feel that Our Hero is cornered, set up, framed - but instead the thinking reader starts to wonder:  surely with all of this happening, someone besides Our Hero will notice that something is suspicious?  That said, i recommend the book anyway.	2001-01-22

Second, i would like to see a little development of what andais is queen OF; she is queen of the unseelie; but her kingdom seems to consist of a single underground castle in illinois.  Is this it? do all the sidhe who arent hiding among the humans living in that mound?  if so, the &quot;alternative worlds&quot; of amber were more satisfying.	2000-11-20

There was some effort here at character development, but there could be a lot more. also, all the stuff about the &quot;lady&quot; just didn't ring true.  If it's going to be there, it should have more attention paid to  it.  in short, i thought a lot more could have been done with the idea, although i still think it's better than most romances today.  but i would still rather reread laurie mcbain, or even better &quot;bride of the machugh&quot; or even jude devereux' scotland book, which was much more fun.	2000-10-12

I loved the length and the complexity.  I was, however, disappointed with the ending.  In fact, it didn't really make sense. why write this fantastic 900 page  tome, and then pay so little attention to the ending?  Suffice it to say  that the closing scenes and the ultimate villain just weren't believable.   it seemed like stephenson was just tired of the book and wanted it to be  over.  i also agree with the reviewer who was irritated by the loose ends.   Who WAS responsible for putting randy in prison?  If it is the person who  seems like the only possibility, it is hard to understand how he had that  kind of power.  Next time, stephenson should take a break if he gets tired,  but come through with a better finish.  p.s. i love lawrence pritchard  waterhouse.	2000-07-21
