It is insightful, engrossing and on target.	2002-11-08

Fascinating.  Intricate.  Will give you plenty of motivation to assess where you are, spiritually.	2002-11-08

Scripture is frequently quoted to support excellent and insightful views.  The book was written just before Y2K and is remarkably correct in predicting what seems to be the current (2002) state of the US economy.  If you are at all interested in the responsibilities and future of today's churches, this is a must read and must act guide.	2002-09-13

Each talks mostly about his own basketball life.  &quot;Who is Rosen?&quot; Well, you are right to wonder.  His chapters are of no interest to the avid fan who wants to hear Jackson's story.  Pay only 1/2 price for this book, since it's the Jackson half that will capture and maintain your interest.	2002-07-27

The problem is the scripture does not always relate to the Graham segment, so it is confusing and non-supportive.  The best part of the book is Graham's commentary.  It would be a lot better if the scriptures matched his thoughts.	2002-07-27

It is loaded with thought provoking challenges about our country and the people who lead America's companies and other organizations.  Amos doesn't preach, but he knows where the answers are.  If you want to give a CEO, VP or other senior level professional something that's easy to read and can better the businesses and lives they affect, consider this book.	2002-06-13

The most extraordinary thing about this book is that you'll see clearly that Franklin did not get where he is because of who his father (Billy Graham) is.  You will be intrigued by how his life took the twists and turns it did.  His journey will fascinate you.  His landing will assure you.  There is only one reason possible that he ended up where he has.  A great read.  A great gift.	2002-06-13

Some chapters go into excruciating detail.  You may realize after reading 1/3 of the book that the rest is innocuous.  This would make (and perhaps did make) a fine HBR article.  It is excessive as a book.	2002-06-13

One of the authors worked at Palm through the bulk of the period, so the insight is real and relevant.  Though the writing style is not at the level of other fast-paced, informative business stories (The New New Thing or Blockbuster, as two examples), it does cover the essentials and moves steadily forward.  If you love your Palm or like high tech business profiles, this book will not disappoint you.	2002-05-09

The subject is interesting.  But, it's the same thing over and over.  If you read 1/3 of the book, you've read it all.  Any third will do.  Just too much of the same stuff over and over.

The author spends a big chunk of pages discussing his personal time and family situations, which makes the book unique, but does leave you wanting more about the school and the students.  This is a well written book and if you want insight into a great Div 3 football program, this hits the mark. It would have been good to get more insight into the student body, religion on campus, why players, coaches &amp; staff at a Catholic school seem to drink and swear so much, etc.	2002-05-03

Instead, the author steps through a functional flow (getting an idea, starting the business, dealing with VC's, etc.) on a chapter by chapter basis, inserting case studies as she goes.  It's quite well done, though somewhat superficial.  You are likely to learn a little from some chapters, nothing from others...unless you haven't lived in the US or followed the business world at all in the past 10 years.  You definitely will be reminded that entrepreneurs are a unique breed with definite challenges ahead of them...and no guarantee of success.	2002-05-03

At least, the ones I wanted to find were not there - such as social subjects and how that relates to the Bible, etc.  Further, each subject is written in a rambling style that doesn't seem (at the end of each) to reach a summarized conclusion of any kind.  This was a lot of money to spend on a book that is so loosely created.	2002-03-26
