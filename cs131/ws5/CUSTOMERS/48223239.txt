I was truly bored, I didn't feel the events in the characters life were developed enough to for my satisfaction. I also didn't care for the main character, which probably added to my sense of frustration while slogging through this title.	2005-09-14

Lots of cliches and alot of back and forth between cities and characters. The second storyline, which I felt didn't belong in womens contemporary romance, went into too much detail about the homosexual couple, Rudy and JP. FYI, no euphemisms used here. Too many events happened that were described in brief, fun things such as the haunted B&B were just miracuously solved in a paragraph with no warning.	2005-06-24

This book contradicts the info I gathered from my other sources (other sources made more sense), the format wasn't organized well, even if I did want to try Woods' methods, where would I start? I do not believe that a failing child needs to be sat down for a whole hour each day and be made to suffer through more instruction and homework at home! And out of nowhere, there is a paragraph on punishment...right after saying that praise is key, she says you may need to use punishment. For what, not being able to read?

The characters are rich, but really good people, uh huh. The characters are of course beautiful/handsome. The cynical workaholic meets the woman of his dreams, chases after her, she has issues.

This title could have been an interesting read if written better, but was only so much twaddle! A used single ply tissue has more strength than featured characters Lute and Nelda! The few dramatic scenes thrown in certainly would have enhanced the book if they had been played out instead of stopping at a safe point. It seems the whole book was written because the author wanted to mention the fact that musicians Holly, Valens, and Richardson were killed in a plane crash in Clear Lake, Ia.

I enjoy Cat Marsala mysteries, and was excited to pick this title up. It started out with some drama but soon lost its way, and became boring. I didn't care for the way Cats family treated her, nor was there anything going on romantically, which is something I like to catch up on. I think it could have been developed further, I would have liked to have known what the lieutenants reaction was at the end, and seen Cats family eating some crow. I guess I am not into Oz either, Brian D'Amatos notes (?) at the end were probably the biggest mystery.	2001-09-01

A first time reader of this author, I was highly pleased with the interesting, well-written opening, however, things went rapidly down-hill. Jane was a total contridiction.
