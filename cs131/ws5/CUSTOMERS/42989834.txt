So, I'm a plus size/thick/phat/fat/big girl and I absolutely LOVED this book. I'm so proud that someone is actually stopping to acknwledge how fabulous fat women are (and yes i said \\"fat\\", it's about time we stop avoiding the word lol)! I suggest that every big girl read this book . . . it's so real. And though you may not agree with everything she says, do realise that this is her perspective and her life as a plus size woman -- respect her for putting it all out there. Anyway, this book inspired my last english paper (I got an A!) on plus size women and fashion! <br />And to all the skinny women reading about this book with their lips curled into a snarl, get over it honey! the title may be about you but this book is not about bashing skinny women, it's about uplifting the big and beautiful girls! <br />Good Read!	2005-09-02
US	42989834	R23HX8UWBKX0XH	0525947906	588569880	Drive Me Crazy	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Change is good	This novel signifies a change in EJD. He isn't sticking strictly to a female character or bouncing back and forth from character to character as he tells this tale of love, lies, and lust (as he has done in many of his previous novels that we all know and love). He has instead taken the time to develope a central male character. And not just any male, but a crossword filling, dictionary reading, limo driving, chocolate covered (threw that one in for the ladies, lol) ex-convict who has dealt with everything from being a preacher's kid to growing up in south central to enduring the memory of a failed marriage to accepting a gay sibling. You will definetly fall in love with Driver and the other characters. I am quite certain that you will enjoy EJD's new writing style.  <br />A good read even if you've never read an EJD book before.	2005-09-02
US	42989834	R1LB5NSDZKIQTP	0758200137	356224225	Baby Momma Drama	Books	5	1	1	N	N	All that Drama	This was basicallly the story of two sisters and their love lives, told from the perspectives of Jasmine (the older sister), Stephanie (the younger sister), Travis (Stephanie's fiance & newest baby's father), and Dylan (the jaded yet sweet-as-pie business owner who meets Jasmine). They are all out for the same thing: Love. But, they all get burned by the flames of lust. (Any further detail would spoil the story.) <br />One of the interesting things about this novel is the relationship between the two sisters. At first they are at each other's throats but later in the novel they closer and more understanding of each other. They have both made mistakes in their lives when it comes to the men they love and they learn that they must accept, support, and love each other before they can lead a successful relationship with anyone else.  <br />The grandmother, Big Momma, serves as the glue that wholes the drama filled family together with her blount, tough love approach. She only wants the best for her girls. <br />I suggest that everyone read this book. Yes, it is full of drama but it is also hillarious at times and heartfelt at others. This really made me examine life and love.	2004-09-29

Writing a novel from a female perspective can be very difficult for a man, but he did it. The story is very exciting, I couldn't put the book down. Of course EJD holds nothing back and brings it to you real, no sugar coating. I also like the way he mentions characters from other books he written. Very beautiful writing.	2003-07-29
