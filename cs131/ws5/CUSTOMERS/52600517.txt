Katrina has written such a beautiful book. I often pick it up to read chapters over again (and the recipes are delicious!).  She includes stories from her own life of things that worked and the sometimes hilarious ones when things went bad (cat peeing on the floor and she lost it in front of the children).  And who among us hasn't packed our children in the car to see some children's entertainer, only to realize later that we would have had more fun snuggling up and reading to eachother at home?  Because she shares her humbling parenting mishaps, it's easier to consider her advice in the stories when she seems like such a perfect parent.  She offers practical and thoughtful ideas for slowing down, connecting, and really being present with our children.<br />This is my favorite book to give to mothers with young or school-age children.  Buy an extra one -- you'll want one to loan out so you can still keep your own.  Enjoy!	2004-03-27

From the first page of the book, you'll find practical tips to cut down the bickering among siblings.  My favorite tip was learning not to even say my children's names when they're bickering and just say &quot;the two of you - that's enough&quot;.  I appreciate the explanations for why it's important to let them work things out whenever you can tolerate the bickering and no one is being seriously hurt.  He also explains the differences between a sibling telling a child they're &quot;smelly and stupid&quot; and a classmate... and why it means you might not have to interfere at that moment when siblings say mean things like that to eachother.<br />This is a great companion book to my favorite sibling book, &quot;Siblings without Rivalry&quot;.  They're both worth having.  Read them, apply them, and get ready for more peace and quiet!	2004-03-27

Don't get me wrong, this was a good book, but the title is misleading (and at the time I ordered it, they didn't have a \\"see inside\\" feature).  The author provides lots of interesting information about the science of the soul but very little about nurturing it.  The problem is that if you already know that you're raising 'little souls' and not just 'kids', you spend nearly all of the book reading info about proof of the soul's existence and neurobiology (fascinating information, but if you've read it before in other books and publications, it's quite repetitive).  <br />Bottom Line:  If you've never really thought about the divine side of childhood or the 'little soul' inside your child, you'll probably love this book.  However, if you already know the soul exists and that nurturing your child's soul is the most important thing you can do for them & you wanted this book to learn more about soul nurturing... you'll probably be disappointed.	2003-01-06

This book is full of wonderful, practical ideas for supporting children and helping them become more resilient.  I appreciate how the authors don't attack parents, but rather present their ideas as case studies based on their years of work with families.  The chapters dealing with schools, teachers, and parents should be a reading requirement for everyone before parent-teacher conferences.  As you read, you're required to take a hard look at yourself - so this is not a \\"ten tips to fix my child, I'm already doing things right\\" kind of book, as shown by this excerpt:  \\"Think of your daily interactions with your children.  Place yourself in their shoes.  Now ask yourself:  If someone responded to me the way I responded to my children, would I walk away from that interaction feeling stronger, would I feel loved, would I be a more resilient person, or would I feel more defeated?\\"  Much of the book focuses on how to make those interactions more positive and I found their examples/case studies really helpful when you're raising challenging children!  They \\"get\\" how exhausting it can be parenting them...and provide practical tips for improving your relationship with them.<br />This book tackles everything from empathy, to understanding temperaments to nurturing \\"islands of competence\\"...and since the case studies include ages of preschoolers through teen years and beyond, it's a book you'll want to keep around to refer to again and again.	2002-02-09

The author has done a tremendous job of taking many experts' views of the &quot;right&quot; way to raise a girl, discussing their merits (pros/cons), and then giving her own recommendations.  She includes specific information and tips for situations you're likely to encounter (from Barbies, to adults commenting on how beautiful your child is, to playground and friendship struggles).  She doesn't come across at all with a &quot;raise your daughter this way....or else...&quot; attitude, but she does really get you to think about how and why you choose to react and how important it is that you understand your child even if you don't agree (empathy).  A bonus is that many of the strategies apply to both boys and girls....and the chapter for fathers is truly wonderful (especially if you're unlikely to get the father to read an entire book).  Also, unlike other books, this book takes you right from your daughter's infancy through teen years and beyond.  It's a book you'll probably read over and over as your child reaches a new stage of development.<br />Bottom line:  You'll learn practical tips and strategies to help keep your daughter's self-esteem strong from preschool through teen years and beyond.  This book has been the favorite among my friends with girls.  Best wishes to you and your girl(s)!	2002-02-06

This book should definitely be read after the authors' first book in the series &quot;The Indigo Children : The New Kids Have Arrived&quot;.  I laughed out loud while reading much of this book as the authors shared some of what they've learned about Indigos since their last book.  This book is not so much about teaching you how to guide these Indigos (their first book offered excellent ideas on discipline, etc.), but more about giving insight about them that you might be able to apply to Indigos you know.  This book isn't formal at all (the authors mention right in the beginning that this book doesn't &quot;flow&quot; the way you might expect), but rather a hap-hazzard collection of &quot;stuff&quot; they've learned.  The stories and messages the authors share help &quot;connect&quot; you so that you feel much less alone in parenting these &quot;royal&quot; children.  The book is an easy read.  Enjoy!	2002-01-18

Each chapter offers strategies for enhancing moral intelligence including...a self-test to evaluate your child's virtue strength, practical ways to enhance the virtue (several to choose from, so you can choose the ones best suited to your child's temperament and learning style), discussion questions to help launch a dialog with your child, and much more.  The one thing that was missing was information on what behavior is developmentally appropriate by age.  For example the quizzes on each virtue are great...but perhaps it's not as serious if a 4-year-old is somewhat selfish or less empathetic than it is for a 12-year-old.  Other than that and the occasional feeling like the book was written for some parents needing significant moral boosting themselves (advice like &quot;don't ask your kids to lie for you&quot;), I found the book very educational and uplifting.<br />Bottom line - This book provides tools to teach critical ethical principles to your child...enabling parents (teachers, etc.) to better model, inspire and reinforce these moral values.	2001-10-26

This is an amazing, empowering book!  James offers methods to help you see, feel and listen to your inner voice... to strengthen your energy field in order to make contact with spirit... to recognize signals from spirit beings (including temperature changes, flickering lights, TV on &amp; off, and more)... to acknowledge the actions of angels in your daily life...to create a development circle to increase your sensitivity...to overcome fears and limitations...and to protect yourself from negative or harmful forces.  He includes examples from his 20-plus years as a psychic that help demonstrate his points.  James has &quot;fine-tuned&quot; his psychic abilities and now he's teaching us how to develop our own innate psychic talents.  So while his other books may have brought healing and hope of an afterlife, Heaven and Earth teaches you how to communicate with it.

There are a variety of great-tasting recipes, so you're likely to find one that makes a dessert your child is craving. If your child truly has multiple allergies, however, this book may not have any recipes you can use. I was also disappointed that most of the recipes use sugar and a gluten flour. For a no wheat, milk, eggs, corn, soy, yeast, sugar, grain and gluten comprehensive recipe book (all meals, snacks, desserts), I highly recommend &quot;Allergy Cooking With Ease&quot; by Nicolette Dumke. Feeding a child with allergies is a challenge. Finding even one recipe they love makes it easier. Best wishes to you and your child.	2001-08-28

However, I was expecting to find ideas I could implement right away - like making our mudroom more functional for kids, etc... but the book isn't really geared towards that.  If you are building a new home or would consider renovating one, you'll find tons of ideas (and beautiful color photos, not sketches) for everything from attic spaces, bathrooms, hideaways, playrooms, special activity rooms, homework centers, family rooms, kitchens, outdoor playspaces and more.  Also, since most rooms/lofts/furniture appeared to be custom built, there's very little info on where to buy or how to make them.<br />Bottom line - you'll find wonderful ideas and inspiration - but not detailed plans.  This isn't an easy &quot;rearrange-the-room-in-a-day-to-make-your-home-more-kid-friendly&quot; project book, nor is it one you can follow if you're on a tight budget.

Although children need to be spoken to in each of these love languages, there's one love language that meets their deepest emotional needs and should be used often with them (and authors caution how you use that language for discipline).  The information in this book complements books that address communicating with children based on their temperament (such as &quot;Raising your Spirited Child&quot; and &quot;Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka).  I also appreciate that the author included an informative chapter on &quot;love languages in marriage&quot;, instead of just a one-liner encouraging readers to buy his book dedicated to that subject.  <br />Bottom line - Even if you've read tons of parenting books, you will truly learn something new from this one - something to enhance your relationship with your child and adults in your life.  You'll probably even learn something about yourself.	2001-07-25

The critter has lost his baseball glove so his mother suggests he cleans his room to try and find it.  He tries to get his family to help, but no one will.  Cleaning up his room means shoving things into the closet and under the bed.  He does decide to make the bed (&quot;won't mom be happy&quot;, he thinks) and when he reaches over the bed to find the pillow, he finds his baseball glove.  My children love this book, but as my five year old pointed out the other day, &quot;he's not putting a few things in the closet like he said he was.... he can't even close the door he shoved so many things in there!  That's not the way you're supposed to clean!&quot;  Although our family finds this book entertaining, I don't feel it teaches a lesson as well as some of the other books by this author... and it definitely doesn't teach them a good way to clean their room!	2001-06-23

I love how the mother and child in this story interact.  When the child wants to keep the salamander he found, the mother (instead of saying &quot;no&quot; or lecturing him about why we don't take creatures out of their natural habitat) asks him questions that require the child to think about what the salamander needs to sleep, eat, play and more.  Step by step the boy imagines how he could meet the salamander's needs, yet still keep it in his room, which is now quickly turning into a woodland paradise for his new friend.  This is a wonderful story for all children - especially for the ones who desire to bring home live &quot;treasures&quot; from nature to keep in their room!	2001-06-09

He also offers lots of advice about playdates, daycare, overnights, and issues for teenagers.

I was hoping the content and emotions in this story would be ok for my 5 year old.  He loved it!  There was just enough suspense, drama and adventure to thrill but not scare him. The novel features four siblings who discover Narnia, a magical world, hidden behind fur coats in a wardrobe inside the home they've been sent to live in. In Narnia, they find ethical and moral challenges as they help their magical friends (mostly talking animals) free the land from the spell of the evil White Witch who has made winter a permanent season and turns anyone who she perceives as a threat into stone.

The book jacket claims content to be a &quot;groundbreaking look at sibling rivalry&quot;.  But with subjects like &quot;recognize and highlight each child's unique abilities and interests&quot; and &quot;use rewards and praise to encourage your children to be more cooperative&quot;, the book fell way short of my expectations for new or groundbreaking ideas.<br />Although not alluded to in the title, the book \\"Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles\\" by Mary Sheedy Krucinka also addresses many sibling issues by helping families understand each other's temperament and communicate more effectively.  A favorite section shows how to say or do things differently to avoid enraging others (i.e. a child who transitions easily may announce he's done playing and move on to the next game...leaving the slower-to-transition playmate in tears or outraged because there was no warning).  She also offers tips to help children change their &quot;bulldozing statements&quot; (often button-pushing ones like &quot;I'm not inviting you to my party!&quot; or &quot;Shut up!&quot;) into statements that persuade others to listen (&quot;I didn't like what you said&quot; or &quot;I'd like a choice&quot;).

This book looked like it would really keep my 2-1/2 yr old entertained- especially on car rides.  It's a nice solid book with large buttons securely fastened to long colorful ribbons.  The first page starts with a brightly colored picture and an indentation to place one button.  Each page adds another place for a button - all the way up to page 10 which has a place for all 10 buttons.<br />The saleswoman where I bought it cautioned me that the buttons get tangled, but I didn't think it would be a big deal and bought it anyway.  I was so WRONG!  Within minutes the ribbons are all wrapped around eachother and the buttons no longer reach where they're supposed to.  If you don't mind spending hours untangling cords (or if you have a child who loves to untangle ribbons, yarn, long strings, etc.), then this is a terrific book.  But for me, the point of the book was to keep my child occupied without my intervention...and for that purpose, this book failed miserably!	2001-05-18

You�ll understand and like your child better!	This book became my first parenting bible when I wasn't sure if I could make it through another day (let alone 16 more years!) with my child.  What's different about it (besides the fact that this author knows your child isn't like most children!) are the explanations of how temperament affects children's reactions to situations and how changing what you say, or your reaction, expectations or schedule can have a dramatic effect on the child's behavior.   She understands it's hard to like a child who seems mean and nasty and embarrasses you on a daily basis - and she doesn't make you feel guilty or inadequate because of it.  I thought of my child's \\"difficulties\\" in a more positive way and could relate to him better after reading and applying the ideas in this book.<br />The author's new book, \\"Kids, Parents, &amp; Power Struggles\\" reviews a few highlights of this book and is loaded with ideas for improving communication and relationships based on a child's temperament and how to help the child communicate his thoughts, feelings and needs in a socially-acceptable way.   One thing missing from her first book, which she covers in her 2nd one is a section on ADD/ADHD and other medical issues which could be contributing to the \\"spiritedness\\" of the child.  Still missing, though, is the mention that food intolerances may negatively contribute to the behavior of the extremely spirited child (which was the case with our child).  I strongly recommend both books to save your sanity and to improve the relationship with your child.	2001-05-18

I found &quot;The Secret Handshake&quot; by Kathleen Kelly Reardon much more useful.  Her book covers the basics &quot;Cain and Abel&quot; does (though much quicker!) and features quizzes to understand your political style (and your co-workers and executive management's too) as well as your company's overall style - and most importantly how to stretch your style at times to meet certain needs. You'll also learn how to handle recognition, patronizing behavior, separating offense from insult, influence cultivating, how to be gracefully right or wrong and much more - issues &quot;Cain &amp; Abel&quot; doesn't address.  &quot;The Secret Handshake&quot; advice applies to anyone wanting to improve productivity by learning the tools and understanding the options for making the politics involved in most any project work for you.  Although &quot;Cain and Abel&quot; is an easy-to-read, well-written book, there's just nothing revolutionary about it and it gives so few ideas about how to succeed in spite of a political environment.	2001-04-30

She offers plans to &quot;strategize&quot; and &quot;attack&quot; while listing common pitfalls and insider tips.  She also provides estimates for how long it may take for each attack step (sort, purge, assign a home, containerize, equalize), which really helped me set expectations for getting the mess under control and maintaining it.  The &quot;what questions to ask before buying that next organizing container, gizmo or gadget&quot; section is a real money-saver!<br />Bottom line - You'll learn how to design an organizing plan based on your goals, your natural habits, and your psychological needs.  Read this book, design and execute your plan, and get ready to feel liberated and empowered!	2001-04-23

Instead of &quot;Stop yelling!&quot; try &quot;When your voice is as calm as mine, I'll be glad to talk with you.&quot; (works for whining too!)  Once you've read this book, the &quot;pearls&quot; are easy to use later as a quick reference (about 50 issues including bossiness, getting ready for school, bedtime, teeth brushing, TV, temper tantrums and whining ).  The first time I read the book a few years ago, I knew there were some great ideas, but I also felt like I was about to let my children initially experience too many logical consequences, and perhaps a drop in self-esteem.  I think the book missed an opportunity to give parents an option to gradually implement their method of teaching responsibility by first acting as an emotional coach.  A recently released book used in conjunction with this one was the answer I was looking for.  If you have young children or think you may want to help coach your children first, try this book along with &quot;Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka (author of &quot;Raising your Spirited Child&quot;).  The combination is powerful!  I keep both books on hand for quick reference and my favorite ideas from them taped to my refrigerator.	2001-04-09

The author's ideas didn't foster good communication skills and worsened the power struggles in one of my two spirited children.  Adults certainly wouldn't say to eachother &quot;that's 1...2...3 - take 5 minutes&quot;.  You're in the checkout line and your child wants a lollipop, you say &quot;no&quot; and they have a tantrum.... so counting makes it better?! It may get them to stop, but do you think the child feels like you heard or understood him? Although the methods worked with one of my children, I much prefer the methods suggested in other books where you plan ahead for potential problems in order to avoid them - but if they come up, you empathize with the child so that they know you heard them.  &quot;Oh, you would really enjoy a lollipop today.  Perhaps we'll get one another time.&quot;  And then keep the child busy helping you load groceries onto the conveyor belt or give them a snack you brought along...Control or Coach?  You decide what works best for you and your family.	2001-04-07

It's hard to believe Dr. Brazelton, who has written so many other brilliant parenting books, was an author of this book!  It's not that the content was bad or controversially new - but as I read it I kept thinking &quot;Been there, heard that.  Where is the infamous Brazelton wisdom and humor usually found in his books?&quot;  This book reads like a thesis and is nothing like his other parenting books.  This book was such a disappointment for  a Dr. Brazelton fan.	2001-04-03

The author has written such a beautiful book - filled with information, tools, reflections, and &quot;exercises&quot; -sure to help you (and your child) expand your awareness of intuition as well as how to embrace and share those &quot;gut feelings&quot;.  My favorite tool in this book was learning how when I'm apart from loved ones, I can imagine a protective light surrounding them, that keeps them safe and sends them my love.  This book is truly a powerful, nurturing guide.  Enjoy!	2001-04-03

A Guide to the Four Temperaments : Choleric, Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Melancholic	Books	4	21	22	N	N	A great resource for improving interpersonal relationships	What's different about this book are the temperaments themselves (choleric, sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic - instead of the standard Myers-Briggs type) and learning how to &quot;guess&quot; temperaments by observing body-types and favorite colors.  What's missing are &quot;quizzes&quot; to help figure out what temperament you are and helpful hints on working with others of different temperaments.  The information is presented in an easy-to-read conversational style.  I recommend it as a supplement to other books on temperaments (my favorites being &quot;Kids, Parents and Power Struggles&quot; and &quot;Raising your Spirited Child&quot;) and not as your only source for information on this subject.	2001-04-03

The book has some variations of ideas that have been around for awhile (&quot;catch them being good&quot;, &quot;earning privileges&quot; by using a reward for good behavior, and &quot;time-outs&quot;), but nothing revolutionary.  The authors use frequent, annoying metaphors to explain simple concepts and repeat themselves a lot, resulting in a difficult-to-read, confusing book.  Before deciding to try the &quot;Nurtured Heart&quot; approach, you might want to read &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; by Alfie Kohn, who challenges reliance on carrot-and-stick psychology.<br />As an alternative, I highly recommend &quot;Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles : Winning for a Lifetime&quot; by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka who also offers a nurturing approach to these spirited children (the author uses a more positive word than difficult, don't you think?), but without a reward-based system.	2001-04-02

This book has more descriptions, information and tips that &quot;resonate&quot; with me than any other book I've read.  You'll find yourself thinking &quot;Yes!  That's EXACTLY what MY child says (or does)!&quot;  Then Mary helps you see the reaction you're likely to get with each potential response... based on your child's temperament (most books overlook the fact that a statement or action that calms one child can enrage one with a different temperament).<br />My favorite sections are the tips about temperaments (especially teaching children and parents how to say or do things differently to avoid upsetting others) and helping children change their &quot;bulldozing statements&quot; (often button-pushing ones for parents, such as &quot;You're not my boss!&quot; or &quot;Shut up!&quot;) into statements that persuade others to listen (&quot;I'd like a choice&quot; or &quot;I didn't like what you said&quot;).<br />Have you read a lot of books and wonder if you'll really learn something new in this one?  Absolutely.  With two spirited children of my own, I've enjoyed the following (plus many others), but now recommend &quot;Kids, Parents, &amp; Power Struggles&quot; instead:  Parenting with Love &amp; Logic; Raising your Spirited Child (an excellent supplement); How to Behave so Your Children Will Too; Magic 1-2-3; Setting Limits; How to talk so kids will listen... (and others in their series- great supplements, though); Children are from Heaven; Children the Challenge; plus others from Dr. Sears, Leach, &amp; Brazelton.	2001-03-30

Remember the first time you took a personality test and learned your personal style and that of your co-workers?  Your eyes were opened to a new style of communication.  This book does the same thing for the corporate politics arena.  You'll take quizzes to understand your political style (and figure out co-workers and executive management's style too) as well as your company's overall style - and how to stretch your style at times to meet certain needs. Some of the most helpful sections of each chapter are the descriptions of a situation, the various options of actions/words that can be taken, and the potential reactions to each option.  You'll also learn how to handle recognition, patronizing behavior, separating offense from insult, influence cultivating, how to be gracefully right or wrong and much more.  This book isn't only for those wanting to climb the corporate ladder - but for anyone wanting to improve productivity by learning the tools and understanding the options for making the politics involved in most any project work FOR you.	2001-03-12

This book gives outstanding detail and theories behind classroom instruction in a Waldorf School.  He includes actual stories, poems, and math exercises used in class - and shows which elements appealed to various temperaments.  Have you ever thought about adding somber details to a math problem to appeal to a melancholic temperament? How brilliant!  All through the book I kept finding myself saying, &quot;Yes!  This is what school should be like!&quot;  If you've wondered what's wrong with schools today... when you read this book you'll know... and you may find yourself wishing you could go back to school and be in his class even if just for one day.	2001-02-04

But that's mostly what this book gives - highlights with not nearly enough description, details, or explanations.  It's not that you'd waste your time reading the book (you can finish it in about an hour), but you might not feel you got your money's worth.  You might want to try &quot;School as a Journey&quot; by Torin Fisner (about the same cost but nearly 3x the length!) which gives outstanding detail (including actual stories and poems told in class) and theories behind classroom instruction when he shares his teaching experience of his own Waldorf Classroom from Grade 1 through Grade 8.<br />Bottom line - if you want a light introduction to Waldorf Kindergarten, this book is fine.  But if you love details with the how's and why's, you'll be disappointed.	2001-02-04

I have a child who is allergic to 60 foods - including wheat (and most other grains), sugar, tomatoes, eggs, corn and many more common foods and spices.  Other books offer great recipes, but often contain an allergen that I don't know how (or there isn't) a substitute for.  If you have only one or two common allergies, you can probably find a book that has great-tasting recipes (and more commonly-found ingredients) that are free of your allergen.  But for a child with multiple food allergies - this book has made living with food allergies an easier part of everyday life by offering recipes with similar taste and appearance to what everyone else is eating.	2000-12-30

The author provides lots of inspiration and encouragement and gives you the tools you need to weave stories into your everyday routine - &quot;transition times&quot;, traditional reading times, times when children are doing something you'd like them to stop doing, to pass time waiting in lines, in the car, etc.  I've learned a wonderful new way to interact with my children.  Once you start telling stories - your children will never let you stop - and you won't want to either.	2000-12-17

But as I read a chapter each night, I kept thinking &quot;it has to get better!  Didn't I like this book as a child?&quot;  I noticed my son wasn't begging me to read more each night, as he had with all the other books.  <br />After we finished the book I asked him his thoughts about it.  &quot;I didn't really like it. I just didn't get what they said!&quot;  I had to agree.  The language and especially the sailing jargon was not clear.  Yet this 5 year old &quot;got&quot; the much more complicated concepts in Rats of NIMH?  I was disappointed that this book didn't spark conversations from my son, like the other books had.  Though we did talk about how interesting it was that the same person who wrote &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot;, a book he truly loved, could also write a book like &quot;Stuart Little&quot;, that he didn't enjoy at all.<br />We're happy to leave Stuart Little behind and be several chapters into &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.  Now I'm hearing &quot;just one more chapter PLEASE...&quot; again.	2000-10-03

Children today seem brighter, more opinionated and definitely more defiant.  They are master &quot;button pushers&quot; and come into this world with a sense of &quot;royalty&quot;.  These children often act and talk like adults in little bodies - appearing wise beyond their birth years.  Traditional parenting methods simply don't work and cause considerable tension and frustration in families. <br />If you've been pulling your hair out (and reading any parenting book you can get your hands on!) trying to find something, ANYTHING, that will help you become a better parent or teacher to a challenging child like this, this is the book.  You'll learn that it's not your imagination --- kids really are very different than previous generations.  The book is full of tips and advice on how to guide these children into adulthood.<br />The &quot;What Can You Do?&quot; chapter offers more than 60 pages of useful information from twelve experts.  Topics in this chapter include &quot;disciplining the Indigo Child&quot;, &quot;seven secrets to raising a healthy and happy child&quot;, &quot;teaching the children&quot;, &quot;sending potent, positive messages to children&quot; and much more.<br />This book will help you recognize and celebrate your children for their exceptional qualities --- and, most importantly, provide new ways to guide them to adulthood while showing them you love and care.	2000-10-03

This book's incredible description of a peaceful, yet interesting garden along with its empowering fantasies like flying a magic car, or jumping to China in magic boots has quickly become an integral part of helping our 4.5  year old boy manage his &quot;energy&quot; - at bedtime AND throughout the  day.  Whenever we see that he's beginning to feel out of control, we now  ask him if he'd like to take some time to rest and visit his garden or fly  in his car.  This garden is such a fun place to visit in his mind, that he  often agrees.  We don't even have to read the book at that moment - he just  closes his eyes and remembers past adventures!  A couple of minutes later,  he's more balanced, relaxed and ready to play again.<br />The morning after we  first read him the magic car &quot;fantasy&quot; (after a night of loud  thunderstorms, when we usually find him hiding under the covers or in our  bed), he said &quot;Mommy!  I went in my magic car and visited the  thunderstorms!  The guardian angel kept me safe and I got to see them up  close - they weren't even scary!  And then I flew through space and I...[he  lists all the things he did].&quot;  So I've added this book to my list of  &quot;great books to give to parents&quot;.	2000-05-31
