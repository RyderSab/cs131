A wife and mother with a successful career discovers her husband can no longer put up with the fights and the neglect. He leaves her and so starts her adventure through time. In the violent world of vikings she finds her husband going by a different name, but he knows her not. She tries to win his heart and in doing so, she realizes why her husband left her. Will she be able to travel back through time to win him back? Will she even want to go back to the future with his viking version so near and dear to her?  <br /> <br />From the first page this book captivated me. I felt every emotion Ruby experienced. The frustration, the jealousy, the desperation, the joy. I fell madly in love with Jack and Thork, but was so angry at Thork at times, I thought I would throw the book across the room. Instead, I kept flipping the pages.  <br /> <br />I laughed, I cried, and I laughed and cried some more. I cherished this book thouroughly and finished it in record time. Two days after I opened it for the first time, I have just finished. I woke my fiance with my sobs. You see, he is my viking and I saw so much of him in this novel. I'm sure you'll see your man too, or atleast the viking version of him. More crude, more muscular, more violent, more insufferable, with a deep need to be loved. Thork was such a real character. He was a true viking (violent, a lady's man, fiercely loyal to his family and his honor).  <br /> <br />The first Sandra Hill novel I read, I really disliked. It took me a over a year to pick up another of her books. Thankfully I gave her a second chance. I LOVE this book as I do so many of her novels! It's not as funny as many of her other books. It's actually quite sad in parts. But the tragic elements are what make it so wonderful to me. I highly recommend this one. And if you want another novel by this great author that will have you laughing so hard you cry, you have to read The Last Viking. Thank you Sandra Hill! <br /> <br />	2004-10-30

Their interaction with one another is dynamic!<br />Sandra Marton is by far my favorite author. She always stirs feelings in me with her 3-dimensional characters.

Matt takes advantage of the fact that his lovely wife (who he has been separated from for 6 months) has amnesia, and he conceals the fact that they were having problems so he can win back her love. But will the strange man who caused her head trauma come back to finish his job? <br />The characters in this novel were two-dimensional and monotonous. I never experienced any feelings for the hero, and the narrative was extremely conventional; it lacked appeal. The love was nonexistent and the suspense was missing as well. I do not advocate spending time reading this book.	2002-06-28

The setup: A handsome Hollywood director and a sassy movie critic meet and sparks fly. No matter how much they want to hate each other, their bodies refuse, and it's only a matter of time before they have the perfect Hollywood ending.<br />This novel started very well. I was instantly hooked but before long the story began to drag. The leading lady wasn't very likeable. She also kept complaining about how unimpressive Hollywood parties, actors and films were, yet her job was a movie critic. Most film critics go into the business because they are intrigued by it. Her complaining was annoying and unrealistic.<br />The conflict between the two lovers turned silly towards the end. The misunderstanding was so ridiculous, I almost didn't even finish reading the novel but since Alice Bowen's other novel (Dangerous Promise by Alyce Bowen) is one of my favorite novels ever, I decided to finish it. <br />The ending was sweet and left me happy for the two characters, but all in all this novel was a major dissapointment. I was expecting so much more. I recommend Bowen's other novel Dangerous Promise (p. 1982). It's also about the Hollywood industy, but it's so well done.	2002-06-05

Fury leads him to force her into an unwanted marriage--but maybe their marriage was wanted afterall. <br />The beginning of this novel started off a little slow but once the characters meet again things pick up. I loved Slade. He was so charismatic and I felt like I could fall in love with him. However, the leading lady got on my nerves. She was very selfish and wanted to keep Slade from &quot;her baby.&quot; She was ruthless. She used Slade to have a child and then never told him about the baby. Then when he discovers he has a son she tries to keep him away. She was so mean to him for no good reason. He deserved much better in my opinion but it was still a good book. His son was precious and the hot scenes sizzled. I recommend!	2002-05-16

Jacques' family comes to him and discovers his mind has been shattered. With time he comes to trust them again and find the betrayer responsible for all his pain.<br />The opening of the novel is captivating but once Shea meets Jacques and begins the long healing process, the pacing become almost unbearably slow. As soon as Raven and Mikhail get involved, the pacing picks up again and the story draws you in. I really enjoyed having the family together. Re-visiting old characters adds so much to this novel. The action scenes were violent but justified, and the sex scenes were hot and few, which I liked. I highly recommend!	2002-05-07

The lake is a refuge for Janey and her little brother Jim, a place where they can get away from their parent's endless parties and the suffocating heat. Janey sees Jim as her child and her mother as an untouchable object of beauty that even her father cannot touch. When Janey realizes her mother's friend wants Janey, she gives into him leaving her young brother to spend his time playing alone as their parents stay in the vacation home.<br />This novel is a fast read filled with vivid descriptions of the lake, rain, water and just about everything else. The imagery is beautiful but at the same time too much description of the environment clogs the details of story. There are only so many times you can read about what the lake looks like, especially since you got it the first time around. The details of the story fall second to the environmental description but the story was an interesting one even though I was left wanting more details. <br />The poetry-like writing style distances the reader from the emotional aspects of the story. Even though I understood what Janey and her father felt, I never became involved to the extent that it affected me. The climax of the story was anti-climatic and mundane in it's instructional execution. I felt this novel, though beautifully poetic, could have been so much more.<br />However, I am looking forward to the movie which opens in theatres today. I am hoping that the visual execution will live up to this story's potential.	2002-05-03

Her father died when she was 11 and a loneliness has lingered with her ever since. She's more mature than her best friend and relates to older people on the island.<br />In particular, she is similar to George, who lost his aunt to suicide decades before, when she mistakenly thought he died in the world war 1. In this time of war and tragedy, the loneliness only grows in these two characters who come to have a special connection to each other, even though they barely interact.<br />This novel started off slow but before I knew it I was hooked. The story came to life through it's honest execution and three-dimensional characters. The pacing was natural and the situations were believable. Alice seemed so real to me and I miss her now that the book has ended. I felt like I completely understood her. Alice is very wise for her age, yet still innocent. I cannot wait until Volume 2 and 3 come out and I hope to see Alice in both novels (Volume 2 is to take place in the 1960s and Volume 3 in the 1980s on Snow Island). <br />Katherine Towler has an impressive talent with words and strong character development. Her debut novel stands out as one of the greatest novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. I highly recommend!	2002-05-02

Mikhail needs to meet his lifemate or he will committ suicide to stop himself from changing into a ruthless vampire. Raven enters his head and his prayers for a lifemate have been answered. The only problem is she is human and therefore has many limitations. The risk of changing her into a carpathian is great but with assassins hunting their every move, Raven's life is threatened. Mikhail knows the only way to save her and himself is to change her to one of them and fight the assasins. She is the Carpathian's ONLY hope to continue their race because the males must have life mates to live a carpathian life and they need women to reproduce more female offspring. Women carpathians are a dying breed.<br />Mikhail loves Raven so possesively, he almost suffocates her by controlling her every move, even when she sleeps and how deep. The completeness of his love was beautiful but I imagine if I were Raven I would be very turned off by his obssesive controlling of her. Still, he was an amazing hero and very easy to love!<br />This novel had a strong beginning. I was immediately drawn into the plot but about half way through I felt the pacing become erratic. The story seemed to drag at some points and go too fast at others but I still wanted to find out about these characters because I was in love with them. I became attached to their strong love for each other and felt they were well-rounded characters.<br />If you enjoy love scenes, you will love this novel. Almost every other chapter has a steamy love scene. Every other chapter also had a very violent scene. <br />I am continuing to read the rest of the series because I hear that they only get better. I highly recommend! :)	2002-04-25

The story was very solid and satisfying. The characters were 3-dimensional and easy to love. I really enjoyed this novel so much so that I did some research and discovered that Cooper Adams (Jenna's rodeo star brother) is going to be starring in a book of his own coming out soon called Cowboy Boss!!!

Grace has everything to lose: a happy life with a loving husband, a wonderful brother and an amazing career. She loses it all in one moment. To save herself and avenge the murders of her husband and brother, she is on the run with the very documents that caused all this horror. The police, thinking she killed her husband and brother, and the killer, who wants the documents, are both after her, but she is a strong and an intelligent woman and she gets away...just barely . She learns &quot;street smarts&quot; and how to survive despite this agressive murderer on her tail.<br />When Grace discovers the mystery the documents hold, she knows she must travel through time as the documents explain to meet Black Niall, who she has been dreaming about since she first discovered the documents. He has shared her hot dreams and their lust for each other is so powerful all he has to do is kiss her to make her explode with passion.<br />With Niall's help, they travel back to 1998 to face the ruthless killer. Niall is almost God-like in his strength and the love he shares with Grace makes you wonder if they were made for each other.<br />I expected a romance novel but instead, this novel was filled with action, suspence and VERY little romance...but when she finally does meet Black Niall (65 pages away from the end of the book!) they share some amazingly HOT scenes!! The story reminded me of the movie &quot;The Fugitive&quot; mixed with the film &quot;Mission Impossible,&quot; But I didn't find the lack of romance all that dissapointing because the story was so well-written and interesting.<br />This story should be classified as a suspence thriller. She doesn't even meet the hero until page 340 (The story ends at page 400). Most of the novel is about her running from the killers. It's exciting and you really come to love Grace and care about her character. She is so three-dimensional, she seems like a real person.<br />Black Niall sounds delicious but he also plays a minor role in the novel. He is like the supporting character and he comes across as 2-dimensional. I never fell in love with him but I did lust after him.<br />The ending was sweet but I had another ending in mind that never came to fruition. However, that made the novel UNpredictable and that's a good thing. This is my first novel to read by Linda Howard, and I see myself picking up MANY more in the future. I HIGHLY recommend!the novel.

The leads grew up near each other in the past, but now they hate each other; yet they are so attracted by one another. Usually this describes the whole book up until the end where they realize they had misunderstandings and really do love each other. <br />However, Rage of Passion is different. The leads quit hating each other before half the book is over and are actually nice to one another. Instead, the conflict stems from the heroine's previous marriage and a custody battle with her vile ex.<br />This made for an interesting story and more of a romance. The hero is very likeable and the heroine, who was abused by her ex, is still a pretty strong woman despite the abuse. The hero helps to heal her and her little girl. <br />I thought Rage of Passion was a nice change for Palmer and I look forward to more novels by Palmer along these lines. It's nice to have some variation.	2002-04-05

Woman hates man. Yet they find themselves immensely attracted to each other and have been since they grew up around each other, but their age kept them away from each other back then because she was too young for him. It's the same trite story but in a different setting with slightly different characters....So why do I like this story? <br />Because I like Palmer's formula. I know how it's going to end and the book is highly predictable but that's part of what brings me back to Palmer time and again. Every once in a while you want to cuddle up and read something familiar and this is it. <br />This novel is well written with 3-dimensional characters that were likeable most of the time. I found the heroine stronger than many of Palmer's heroines. She would stand her ground and talk back, when she wanted to. She would LET the hero &quot;force&quot; her to do things that she secretly yearned for. I don't call that weak. I call that giving into ones desires. <br />The Rawhide Man is a fast read and good for a dull day. If you're looking for something new by Palmer, this is not it. But if you want the Palmer classic story, you've come to the right book.	2002-04-01

He never listens to her and because the doctor says no sex, he decides not to sleep in the same bed with his wife because of his 'if we are not having sex then why bother sleeping in the same bed' attitude. He is so completely dense! he believes his wife has been cheating on him with several men and that she may be disease infested so he wears condoms so he won't get her diseases. <br />And yet this weak heroine stands for all of this treatment for no reason except to keep this miserable story moving. She never confronts his wrong assumptions by just telling the truth. Instead she withdraws and is annoyingly silent. She runs away from him and yet he never was abusive and she never was abused. She just becomes this incredibly weak person. <br />The only reason I continued reading this horrible story was because I was stuck on a plane with nothing else to read.

The prologue drew me in fast and once I was hooked, I could not put this book down until it was over. By page fifty, I had cried so much my eyes were puffy and red. Sandra Marton brings these characters to life. She lets you see what they are thinking and I felt like I understood their decisions by reading about their internalized feelings. <br />The hero and heroine are so right for each other but their wrong conclusions about the past make them star-crossed lovers. The attraction they have for one another sizzles and I even felt my stomach flip when he'd kiss her. My emotions were so caught up in this novel but...<br />The ending would have been perfect had the characters feelings been revealed to the reader. However, at the most vital scene, Sandra Marton stops revealing the character's feelings to the reader. Instead there is dialogue between the characters and the secrets are revealed with out the reader ever knowing how the other truly feels about the revelation. This makes the end unrealistic and it falls flat. A few lines of internalized feelings would have made this a five-star book, and because it comes so close, I would have liked to give it 4.5 stars.<br />I highly recommend this novel because, even though the ending falls slightly short of perfect, this book is a great read with three-dimensional characters, an interesting plot, and great pacing.	2002-03-02

I'm usually very good about picking the killer but EVERYBODY was suspect to me in this book.  When an author can hide the killer the entire time, it's a real treat. I wasn't surprised at who it turned out to be because I knew it had to be one of the several people I suspected. <br />In addition to the suspence, this novel has a thread of romance.  You easily fall in love with the characters and invest in their relationship.  I cared what happened to these characters and cared about the survival of their relationship.<br />If I had to complain, I would say that I wished it was even more scary.  I was expecting to be scared out of my wits but it was hard to relate to a woman who lived in the middle of nowhere with no electricity in the 90s.  I think if the setting had been an apartment in the city, I would have been more likely to feel frightened because I would be thinking this could happen to me. Instead, I was distanced from the situation because I could not relate to the setting. <br />However, I think this is a wonderful novel and worth the read.  I highly recommend!	2002-02-18

I had to keep checking the front page to make sure this terrible book was by one of my favorite authors, Diana Palmer.  Every character in this novel was one-dimensional, and the book was so dialogue heavy. It never SHOWED me what the characters were feeling, but only what they were saying.  I love Diana Palmer but this book was such a dissapointment.  I wanted to love it, but I did not care about whether the characters got together or whether they lived or died.  This was one of the worst books I've ever read.  The only reason I finished it was to be fair to one of my favorite authors. Pass on this one; it's a waste of time.  Try Palmer's Lacy.	2002-02-06

WARRIOR is a steamy romance filled with three-dimensional characters that come to life and are easy to love. <br />&quot;As a biologist, Eden Summers had confronted all kinds of wild creatures, but never had she encountered any as gloriously untamed as Nevada Blackthorn. Life had taught this defiant warrior some painful lessons. Now he believed in survival-and nothing else. Yet Eden saw a gentleness behind the man's steely self-control, and she longed to tame his wild heart...and soothe his restless soul.&quot;<br />I finished this book the same day I picked it up. The first page hooks you, and you're pulled into this hot romance that will not let you down.  I highly recommend.	2002-01-29

Amelia is physically abused by her father and mentally abused by King through most of the book.  I've never hated a lead man in a book so much.  King is one of the most dense characters ever! I can't stand him! Ughhh! He is so distasteful! Amelia was weak through most of the book and just got on my nerves.  I guess it was understandable because she was being abused but her loyalty to her abusive father was just sick! King almost gets her beaten to death and that is sooo UNFORGIVABLE in my eyes.  I wish I never picked this book up! It made me cry because I was so angry and felt so sorry for Amelia.  It wasn't a romance.  It was a pity fest. Yet I had to give it 2 stars cause no matter how much I hate the book, it did make me feel something and I did like her brother Quinn and his story.	2002-01-05

I had heard wonderful things so I bought this novel with high hopes and was deeply, deeply dissapointed. <br />The plot was dull. The love story was not romantic. There was no suspense. I am easy to scare yet this book didn't arouse any fright. The mystery was entirely too easy to figure out. I actually was laughing towards the end of the book because it was so bad. I couldn't believe I had spent money on this dull novel. <br />Seriously, don't waste your time or your money. Maybe Clark has some other great books, but this one was not one of the good ones. Too bad I read this one first. Now Clark is ruined for me. I doubt I'll try this author again.	2002-01-05
US	50602553	RJ9HMQGUZSGCB	0515130389	573580919	Carolina Moon	Books	3	2	3	N	N	No surprise here	I don't know if I'm just really good at knowing who the killer is in a book or if it was just too obvious but I knew who commited this crime at about a third of the way through the novel.  Still I enjoyed the story somewhat.  <br />The lead character was a strong woman but after all the abuse from her evil dad and pitiful mother, it was amazing she turned out ok (and unrealistic).  I think the father was also unrealistic in some ways.  If he wanted to molest his daughter and not just beat her (the daughter admits she knew her father wanted her sexually when she was a child), it's hard for me to believe that a man as evil as he was would hold back. <br />Things just didn't add up in her family life, and the end was cheesy and predictable.  Definately not one of her best books but still interesting.	2002-01-05

Why is it that I always get so upset at the male leads and then fall head over heels for him?

The dialogue was so natural.  I truly felt like Barbara could have been recounting a true story word for word. The relationships between the characters are 3-dimensional, and I understood all the character's reasons for making the decisions they made. I cried, I laughed a little, and I felt alot. <br />This book revealed some truths about how many people live their lives in fear of being unaccepted and unloved, and how some do not know how to show love or know when they are loved.	2001-12-29

There was no climax; no big secret.  The end of the book was so abrupt, I couldn't believe it! It had such potential and then totally flopped.

Still I read it through to be sure I was right.  The romance didn't make me feel anything.  The characters didn't seem to connect in a way that made me feel that they were honestly in love.  The lead male was two dimensional and even the lead female was a little too cold at times but still had depth.  The theme of sex and violence was a nice change for me.  I enjoyed that it was a little different from all her books and more of a mystery.  I wanted more of a closure at the ending, but it kind of ended abruptly.  Also, there were times when the story dragged as Roberts tried to flesh out small characters.  I could have done with out that but still it was interesting and a good book to read if there's nothing else to do.	2001-05-10
