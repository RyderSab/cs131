The catch is, this time, is that the survivor of the attack, a small child named Nixie Swisher, attaches herself to Eve and ends up living in her home while Eve tries to figure out who killed her family. <br /> <br />I thought this was brilliant. We get to see Roarke struggling, with his own desire to \\"fix\\" everything, as well as seeing them both out of their depth with \\"normal family life.\\"  A potential tension is introduced into their relationship - he wants children, and she's not ready to even think about it.  The other characters, including Summerset, show different sides of their personalities, and Nixie was great, funny and very believable.  It's also nice to see Peabody and McNab getting along so well and Peabody growing into her role as Eve's partner. <br /> <br />I don't agree with the other readers that Eve should be \\"nicer\\" and should have gotten over her trauma already.  It's refreshing to read a novel in which abuse issues are addressed realistically (well, except for the gorgeous, billionaire husband part).  I also find myself wondering when and if Eve will EVER be ready to have children, what that would take, and how she would get there.  At this point, I can't imagine it, which may be exactly what Ms. Robb wants.   <br /> <br />I really like what she's doing with this genre and can't wait for the next installment.	2005-06-10

The deterioration of Sarai's character into a mindless idiot was very disappointing, as was the convenient way in which Ms. Pierce disposed of the other children.  Far too much of the book was spent on the mechanics of spying, which, though interesting, did not serve to drive either plot or character development in any significant way.  I also prefer my evil characters to have  bit more nuance.  One of her most awful villains (in Cold Fire) is the more awful for the small amount of empathy he evokes. <br /> <br />Aly, also, did not seem to suffer from any sort of moving transformation - her conflicts were just not that believable, especially compared to Alanna's struggles over her relationship with Jonathan, or Keladry's grief and anger in \\"Lady Knight.\\"  As for Nawat, I am sorry to say that I just found him dull. <br /> <br />I'm rating this as two stars, because I still admire what Ms. Pierce is trying to do, but I hope she gets back on her game in her next novel.	2005-06-10

This book covers the journey of a rather strained party of travelers, four magically-gifted \\"mystics\\" and two King's riders who are assigned to protect them, as they move through the kingdom, trying to discern if rebellion or other issues are surfacing. <br /> <br />The book is definitely predictable.  I had figured out several key plot devices well before the major characters did.  It is also derivative:  other authors have covered the \\"hate and fear magicians\\" topic before.  However, I am still giving it five stars, because the plot is enjoyable, the characters are believable and interesting, and the world-building is great.  I especially enjoyed that both Tayse and Sennath are very strong, but also very vulnerable at the same time.  The villains are dangerous, irritating, and fanatical, but very believable.  I also enjoyed watching the gradual evolution of the characters and their relationships with each another.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.	2005-06-10

(with a spoiler or two)	With &quot;Emma's Secret,&quot; Barbara Taylor Bradford returns yet again to the world of the Hartes.  This story centers around the mystery of Evan Hughes, a young American woman who is somehow connected with the Hartes.  Interspersed with this story is a look at how Emma, Blackie and the other original characters got through World War II.  Compared to the other section of the book, this one just shines, making me wonder if perhaps this was cut from the original manuscript of &quot;A Woman of Substance.&quot;<br />The rest of the story, I'm sorry to say, was just tame.  The characters are a bit flat. and a lot of the original conflict and spark is leached out of the story.  The ending also appears rushed.  We get cameo appearances by Jonathan Ainsley, who is still sociopathic and evil, but never actually DOES anything, except lurk and make menacing speeches.  Sarah Lowther also reappears, but it seems that she is now a sympathetic character, without a hint of rancor about how Paula summarily tossed her out of the family several years earlier.  I found that incomprehensible.  I also found the conflict between Tessa and Linnet somewhat unrealistic.  The mystery never really held my interest and the open ending seemed rushed (or an invitation to buy the sequel?).<br />I'm giving this two stars for the great Emma Harte excerpts.	2004-06-07

As always, Ms. Lackey tells a good story and her characters are interesting and fun.  <br />However, Kiron settles back in to freedom and his home society so smoothly, it didn't seem as though he'd left at all.  Also, I found it rather shocking that the loss of his family described so movingly in &quot;Joust&quot; is not even *mentioned* in this book.  With his status and particularly with his dragon, doesn't he think to ask one of his new friends for help in locating and rescuing them?  I also didn't understand why the villains chose to suddenly escalate their strategy.  We're led to believe that this particular group has been engaging in their behavior for three centuries, and yet, all of a sudden, they begin acting in strange and oppressive ways for no apparent reason.<br />Criticisms aside, this was a really good book, with some very funny and interesting moments.  It did lack the emotional impact of some of her other books, especially the Vanyel series.	2004-05-30

Maybe it's because I enjoyed \\"Fresh Air\\" very much, but I found this sequel to be very disappointing.  The characters, with the exception of Lucinda, were largely static.  Renee's change of character was completely unbelievable, and the plot device involved with her was lifted wholesale from one of Ms. Allen's other books.  Gin hasn't changed at all, Katanya and her family appeared as \\"walk-ons.\\"  Although I did enjoy seeing Lucinda's transformation and budding romance, she is ALWAYS right and the people she disagrees with are ALWAYS wrong.  It's really annoying.  Eli also seemed to be too good to be true.  Jason (Soupboy) was a lot of fun, but, again, his character seemed recycled from other books, especially Dream Train and Claudia's Shadow.  Since I am complaining about recycling characters, I also noticed that this is the third time Ms. Allen has named the mother in her story \\"Lily.\\"  <br />Maybe it's just because I've read so many of her other books, but this one seemed formulaic and repetitive to me.  The moving attempt to integrate 9/11 into the plot raised it from one to two stars.	2004-05-29

I am sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed.  Although this story DID feature a look at the women characters, and Ms. Kurtz DID include a formidable woman abbess, in the tradition of Hilda of Whitby or St. Hildegarde, the book consisted largely of description of Alyce de Corwyn's life and times as she came of age, with virtually no plot.  <br />We meet a plethora of new and interesting characters, many of whom get killed off.  We have the appearance of a stock villainness, who appears, commits a heinous sin, and conveniently dies.  Over and over, we hear of Alyce's willingness to be married off as part of her dynastic duty, yet that thread is dropped in the most improbable of ways.  We get an update on how Deryni are doing at this court, a look at a Haldane King who is ruthless, and basically meet a bunch of stock characters.  Unfortunately, Ms. Kurtz still seems unable to write an ambivalent hero (or a likeable villain) unless Donal and Jessamy are supposed to be so, but neither elicited strong emotional reactions one way or another. <br />Again, beautiful and vivid world-building, an interesting look at the convent, in particular, and I enjoyed learning more about Alyce (who seems rather too perfect for my liking), but I was very disappointed in the lack of plot holding this book together.	2004-04-20
US	50109712	R1K7YYITL5BO5K	0441011349	257317250	Angel-Seeker: A Novel of Samaria	Books	5	4	7	N	N	Very beautiful story, with familiar themes... (spoilers!)	&quot;Angel-Seeker&quot; is the story of two women of Samaria.  Elizabeth is a young woman who has lost all of her close family and yearns to recreate the security she knew as a child.  At the first opportunity, she moves to new angel hold at Cedar Hills, hoping to attract an angel and bear an angel child, as she will then have a place forever.  Rebekah is a Jansai woman who is preparing for her upcoming marriage.  She encounters an angel who needs her help, tends him, and, gradually, they fall in love.  <br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this story has several familiar themes, especially to &quot;Jovah's Angel.&quot;  It was nice to see familiar characters again.  The theme of the wild young woman finding contentment with an Edori lover is somewhat overdone, although I found Elizabeth to be much more likeable and interesting than either Miriam (Angelica) or Delilah (Jovah's Angel).  In fact, I found Elizabeth to be one of Shinn's more interesting and sympathetic characters, as she seems to grow and change throughout the book.  Rebekah seemed a bit more passive and certainly somewhat cavalier regarding her own safety - and the potential disgrace she was bringing upon her family.  If she is willing to risk all to take an angel lover, surely it would have occurred what risks she was running.  She seems imaginative - I would have liked to see her chafe more at her restrictions and wonder more what it would be like to be born into a different type of family.  Her reluctance to leave Breven (and her willingness to honor her betrothal) seem odd to me.  Jordan was a wonderful character, one of my favorites - and the freeing of the Jansai women and seeing the Jansai men get theirs was a terrific scene.  Delightful.<br />I do hope that Ms. Shinn finds some new and creative ways to keep writing about this world.  There are only so many ways one can write about the clash of the Edori with the Jansai, with the angel, or the greedy merchants vs. the righteous angel(s); orthe beautiful, innocent pure heroine finding love with the angel (or the more central male character) where the less pure, more worldly-wise woman finds love with the selfless, devoted Edori lover (and perhaps less material success than she wanted or had been accustomed to, but that's all right, because she finds TRUE LOVE).  That is a bit hard to swallow.<br />I'm giving it five stars, because it actually is one of my favorite Samaria books, and because of Elizabeth - but probably will get the next book from the library, just in case.	2004-04-20

Lewis, because the basic premise of this book is very similar.  A young demon, Termite, receive regular communications (h-mails) from her advisor, Anesthesia, as to the best way to ensare her &quot;victim&quot; as the woman progresses from college through adulthood, including marriage and motherhood.  <br />The e-mail (excuse me) &quot;h-mail&quot; format works well, allowing for an immediate glimpse into the &quot;victim's&quot; day-to-day life, and her ongoing struggles with issues like her weight problem or a gossiping church group.  The subtle infighting between Anesthesia and Termite is hilarious, as are the not-so-patient corrections Anesthesia makes of her young protege (who appears fairly thick) - through them, I found myself observing all of the tiny ways I get in my own way.  The ending was especially great.<br />Although there were one or two subtle political sentiments I disagree with, this is still going on my gift list for those who are wrestling with what is core to a life of faith.	2004-04-17

Finally, she writes a mystery in which Roarke's involvement is intrinsic to the plot - he's not just shoving his way into Eve's job.  Their conflict was so well-drawn and realistic, it amazed me.  I was very impressed with its resolution, in how far Eve and Roarke have come to understand each other.  I do have to disagree with the reviewer who said that Eve's response &quot;emasculated&quot; Roarke - she was the wounded party, it's for her to decide if and how she wants to retaliate.  If he just jumped in, he would take away her power even more.  On a side note, it's a real pleasure to read about people with childhood issues who have to continue to work through them - so often, True Love comes along, and that's just the end of it.  <br />The mystery was good and entertaining, with several amusing, well-placed, political &quot;slams.&quot;  It's also delightful to see Peabody as a detective and to get a closer look at Caro.  I am looking forward to Visions in Death and to when this comes out in paperback.	2004-04-17

This book is a very nice read.  It has an amusing premise, that &quot;The Tradition&quot; that creates and guides fairy tales has a life of its own, and that sometimes, fairy tales need to be modified!  The characters were sympathetic and the plot was interesting enough to keep me reading.  Lackey obviously enjoys world-building; she has the details of her world worked out very nicely.  <br />That being said, most of the book is derivative, of her own works, if not from others (i.e. the Elven Court motif).  How many times are we going to read about the deserving person (such as Talia or Vetch or Vanyel or Lavan or Rose) who emerges from an oppressive destiny to settle into a new life?  Following that is a period of apprenticeship, a major test of some kind, and then True Love (well, Vetch found his with a dragon and Laven with a Companion), but True Love nonetheless.  Then - either a happy ending or Final Challenge that result's in the protagonist's death.  <br />I enjoy Ms. Lackey a lot, but I wish she would spend a little more time challenging her characters and fleshing them out a bit before she starts writing.  I hesitated between three and four stars, but four won, as I did enjoy this book very much.	2004-04-17

I did enjoy Lackey's attention to detail and her story was very good, with a nice surprising twist tucked away.  &quot;Drusilla's Gift&quot; irritated me - too much shifting around, although I did like both main characters.  I was also never really clear on what was going on.  I normally enjoy Catherine Asaro's writing, but found this story totally predictable and Iris' dialect more than a bit annoying.  Another annoyance goes to the publisher - please make sure that the names are RIGHT on the book jacket - that is an apprentice editor's mistake!<br />Three stars for the interesting Mercedes Lackey, with some credit given to interesting world-building from Catherine Asaro.	2003-11-12

Imagine my surprise when I read \\"Birthright,\\" an interesting story that weaves together  plot threads of Callie Dunbrook discovering a new identity with the very interesting archeological dig, while rekindling her relationship with her very sexy ex-husband, Jacob.  The story is interesting, and the characters well-developed - I particularly liked the episode where Lana has a bad day, instead of being as perfect as so many of Nora Robert's heroines are.  The major attraction of the book for me, though, was watching Callie and Jake attempt to get beyond their problems and established patterns and really work on their relationship.  That really sold me.  <br />I'm giving this four stars rather than five, because the ending was rushed and the climax UNBELIEVABLY contrived, but, other than that, I really enjoyed this book.  I hope she writes more like it.	2003-04-28

Vetch is a serf, bound to the land, and to his cruel master, when he is rescued by a &quot;Jouster&quot; - a sort of knight-equivalent who rides a dragon.  Vetch is a very likeable, pragmatic character, and Ari is a fascinating one; someone who doesn't fit the mould of his society.  Lackey really excels at world-building and description, but this book is a little thin on plot.  I especially enjoyed &quot;listening&quot; to her characters' ethical reflections and dilemmas, though.  This is a very good, interesting read, though not one I would buy in hardcover.	2003-04-28

Although she describes herself as &quot;an ordinary person,&quot; these reflections are not ordinary:  she discusses such topics as resurrection, fasting, chastity, intercession, and solitude.

I don't agree.  It is wonderful to see Keladry grow into her role as a commander.  It is equally powerful (if not wonderful) to get the full description of the war scenes, the desolation of the camp, with the attention to detail.  Others have complained (warning, spoilers!) that Keladry's relationship with Cleon didn't go anywhere.  I actually kind of liked that, and I liked that, for once, a story doesn't have to be about a romance to be interesting and a female heroine doesn't have to be involved with someone to have an identity (although, I would like to see her fall in love and live happily-ever-after, eventually).

The problem is, it just doesn't compare to Lee and Miller's Liaden novels, with their wonderfully intricate plots, terrific characters and intriguing storylines.

This is a shining example of series that has intelligent plots, wonderful world-building, great, interesting characters that drew me in.  As one other reader has said, I never much cared for Pat Rin, either, but once I started the book, I found myself rooting for him, more and more.  Lee and Miller have a wonderful ability to evolve their characters without resorting to cliches or stock appearances - their characters are always nuanced, and grow with the series.  I also really enjoy the plot twists, although I would have liked to know more about why the Commander of Agents acted as he did.<br />Val Con's reaction at the end of the book threw me - I'd never seen anything in his character that led me to believe that he'd be that happy at the Council decision - but, other than that, a really wonderful story.  I hope they write other stories with these characters, because they are wonderful and their world is sublime.

Although some of her ideas and stories on her faith journey are interesting, her stories are overloaded and overwrought, and she tries too hard and is too self-consciously witty for this to be a good read.  (Who cares if she wears fishnet stockings?)  I felt as if she needed to document everything that had to do with her faith life, whether of interest to the reader or not, which made the book &quot;cluttered&quot;, as least for me.<br />Her discomfort with the two labels of &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot; shines through, as does her evident pain of the exile she now feels from her Orthodox community.  I really wanted to hear more about why she became a Christian, what drew her to Christianity, why she felt the need to leave Judaism - was she feeling these doubts all along?  If so, why not engage them *before* converting to Judaism?  Part of me wonders if any faith community will ever be enough for Ms. Winner, especially since the ending was somewhat open.  I think she has some interesting ideas and thoughts, but wished she'd waited to write this book until she'd matured a little more.	2003-02-24

This book is great for anyone who is interested in writing.  Through a series of suggestions, Anne Lamott both offers ways for writers to practice their craft and for them to deal with the inevitable difficulties that come with pursuing creativity, such as writer's block, jealousy and harsh criticism.<br />Not only is the advice excellent, but the book is hilarious.  Ms. Lamott speaks frankly (and endearingly) of her own failures, both as a writer and as a person, and tells some hilarious anecdotes.  Since I struggle with jealousy, that chapter is one of my own personal favorites.  This book is also liberating, in that it gently and subtly gives us (or, at least, me) permission to accept our own flaws and negativity, and see if perhaps they wouldn't make a good short story.  <br />For those looking for a detailed how-to manual on writing and publication, this book would probably be a disappointment.  For others who might be interested in a excellent writer's reflections and musing on her craft, this is very funny reading, excellent advice, and would make an wonderful resource.	2002-08-24

This collection by theologian and author Molly Wolf, taps even deeper into the mystery of human suffering and pain than her previous books.  In these beautifully-written essays, Wolf discusses tragedy, post-traumatic disorder, jealousy, and other issues that rip the human spirit.  Wolf doesn't spare herself or her readers - at times the imagery is very, very powerful and quite graphic.  This is a searingly honest, deeply personal and redemptive book that establishes Wolf as a new and important voice in Christian theology.	2002-08-24

The one exception to this is, as other writers have noticed, John Mohr's story, \\"Lover of Shadows.\\"  That is a beautifully-crafted interesting and marvelous story.  I hope he writes some more.  It is a pleasure to encounter familiar characters again, such as Joram, Evaine, Rhys, Richenda, Dhugal and so on, and get some more information about them.<br />This collection also cleared up something for me, in that Ms. Kurtz explains that she tries to write her female characters closer to the way medieval woman actually lived.  Her choice, of course, but, I have to say, if I wanted to read about the way women lived, I would read history, not fantasy.  I also notice, interestingly, that she does not follow our medieval history by producing great female abbesses or theologians.  Surely, the Church of Gwynedd could produce a Hildegard of Bingen, a Hilda of Whitby or a Catherine of Siena?  Again, her choice, but I have to say one of the reasons I only get the Deryni books from the library instead of buying them is that the only women who actually hold real power are either misguided or evil, and that her most sympathetic and interesting characters are invariably male.	2002-08-15

I just re-read this book, having read it for the first time last summer, and wasn't as thrilled with it then as I am now.  I've changed my mind.  It is truly fabulous.  I still missed Hannibal, and wondered where Artois came from, but the book flows along so seamlessly, those were just minor questions in the back of my head.  Hambly's world-building is wonderful, the atmosphere of place and time richly drawn, and her characters grow and change, but still remain true to themselves, right down to Livia not offering January any sugar with his tea.  The book starts off fairly slowly and builds to an impressive climax, much like the hurricane described in the book.  I especially enjoyed getting a closer look at Chloe St. Chinian, who marries Dominique's protector, Henri, and see if she truly was the \\"chill, pale girl\\" described in \\"Died Upon a Kiss,\\" but the whole book was wonderful.<br />Several plot lines are tied up in this book.  I only hope that doesn't mean that there won't be any more Benjamin January books, but was hearted to read on the book jacket that Ms. Hambly is working on the next one.  It can't get here soon enough for me.	2002-08-01

I usually love Charles De Lint's writing, and when I heard he was writing a book about Jilly Coppercorn's story, I was thrilled.  What a letdown.  His writing is still beautiful, although without the usual sense of magic and a bit more heavy-handed, hence the two stars, rather than one.  In other novels, such as &quot;Memory and Dream&quot;, magic blends more seamlessly into the story, in this book, the Dreamlands sequence seemed very either-or.  I also think there were too many characters.  It was hard for any one of them to develop - it almost seemed cluttered.<br />As one reviewer has already stated, I didn't buy Raylene's transformation, either - she's depicted as this ice-cold, half-insane killing machine, and all of sudden, she *stops*, and sacrifices herself for Jilly?  It seems incredibly implausible.  Also, for several books, De Lint has been teasing us with the possibility of a relationship between Jilly and Christie, and then demolishes that possibility with Daniel, who really appears more like a cardboard cutout.  And where did Sophie's sudden reluctance to take Faerie seriously come from, let alone all of Wendy's doubts?  Finally, the ending felt very incomplete and tacked on - he was working toward this major climax, and then undercut it.  I hope I like Charles De Lint's next book better, because I found this one very disappointing.	2001-12-30

I agree that the confusion between Ashe and Rhapsody is perhaps a bit contrived, and, frankly, I think Ashe is something of an idiot, at least in those scenes.  However, the battle and confrontation scenes are excellent, however, as is the interaction between Achmed and Rhapsody in particular, and the plot twists are very interesting.  I also like watching some of the bloom rub off of Rhapsody's ideals - she really comes into her own in this book.  Very good book - I hope that Haydon writes some more in this universe!	2001-12-30

In her simple, straightforward and lucid style, Reverend Barbara Crafton shares several stories drawn from her personal and ministerial lives. The stories are brief, their impact is not. She has a unique gift for being able to see the grace and meaning in simple incidents and to convey it without getting in the way.

The &quot;fairy tale&quot; was revolting, Colby was way, way, way too controlling and macho, and instead of both characters changing and growing together, as usually happens in her other books, Diana seemed to be the only one whose lifestyle had to change.  I did like Brandon, and his subplot interested me.  I actually bought this book to read on a trip, and disliked it so much, I left it on the airplane.  <br />Actually, if anyone else had written this book, I probably would have given it two or three stars, but since I've read one or two of Ms. Krentz's other books, I know how good she can be!  For those of you who, unlike me, prefer more traditional romances, this could be your cup of tea.  It wasn't mine, alas.	2001-08-05

It tells the story of Amelia Jones, an introverted, somewhat sad young woman, who discovers an unsolved murder, and embarks upon a quest to discover what really happened. <br />As Amelia searches for the truth, she meets some very interesting characters, and finds out some very poignant truths about herself.

That it doesn't is a tribute to Episcopal priest Suzanne Guthrie's wonderful way of infusing even the dullest and most tedious activity with grace.

When she is telling stories and letting the reader see how they informed her later life and faith, this work shines.  However, occasionally, she descends into routine descriptions of events, coupled with long lists of names of the poets she worked with.  Although the work was enjoyable, I would rather have seen more shaping around the incidents described, and less straight description.  As it is, I am not sure if I read a history of the American poetry in the 1970's, a biography or spiritual memoir.  If I could, I would give it three and a half stars.	2001-07-30

It tells the story of Maya Witherspoon, a half-British, half-Hindu medical doctor, who has moved to London to escape the enemy who has killed her parents.  Returning to the world of &quot;The Fire Rose&quot;, it uses the same system of Elemental Magic.  <br />This book draws you in, with excellent world-building, interesting supporting characters (including a very charming one based on Lord Peter Wimsey), and, for once, a villain who may be evil, but whose logic makes a twisted sort of sense.  Although Lackey's explanations and sidelines do occasionally interfere with the plot and we never actually get to meet a Gnome, this is a very engaging, interesting and fun book.

Zimmerman's language is clear, simple and beautiful:  her faith and love shine out through every word.  She imbues her poems with mystery and faith, without backing away from the difficulties inherent in Christian ministry:  both as Christ experienced them and for disciples, ancient and modern, who seek to follow him.

Too often, it seems that Jesus is depicted either as judgmental, angry and punitive: or meek and mild beyond all reason.  The Jesus as illustated Dr. Donoghue's Scriptural examples is a full, rich and complex human being, a person who gets angry, is sad, feels betrayed and hurt, and expresses his feelings fully.  This Jesus is one that resonates with the words &quot;fully human and fully divine.&quot;  <br />This book is eminently readable, gentle and sane.  Its one fault was that parts of it struck me as very mildly and unconsciously sexist, in that he tends to speak of women in terms of their relationships and appearance, but men in terms of their jobs.  This could, however, be simply a function of the population he sees.  Other than that very minor point, it is a wonderfully refreshing spiritual resource, one that should be widely read and enjoyed.	2001-04-08

In engaging such issues as the role of the laity, the function of the ordained ministry and its role in the church, Dr. Countryman reminds us that all Christians - indeed, all humans - are not only sacred, but function as priests and ministers in their own right, and each has his or her own calling.<br />This book strips away many preconceptions regarding ordained ministry and invites its readers into a dialogue concerning the nature of priesthood, vocation and calling.  It would make (and has made) a wonderful basis for a study group, and should be required reading for anyone even nibbling away on the idea of ordained ministry.  A deeply thought-provoking, valuable, and insightful spiritual resource.	2001-04-08

In this book, Ms. Mathewes-Green juxtaposes descriptions of the Mass with insights, essays and commentary on Orthodoxy, religion, American society, and other modern issues, such as abortion.<br />While her writing is clear and interesting, her strong focus on the pragmatic contrasts sharply, and jarringly, with the almost mystical descriptions of the Eucharist.  Her writing has also taken on an unpleasantly sanctimonious undertone:  other Christians are depicted as over-ritualized and cold,going through the rituals without intelligence or thought; or vapid and childishly simple-minded.  Also, her attempted explanation of the need for an all-male clergy, while valiant, rings hollowly, at best.  Once again, women, according to this system, may only aspire to a sacred leadership role through, and only through, a relationship with a man.  One wonders how an Orthodox woman who feels called to ordination would feel, reading this.<br />Although I admire Ms. Mathewes-Green's deep faith and commitment to the church she obviously loves, the marriage of mysticism and daily life; modernism and a traditional faith did not quite come off, at least not for me.  An interesting work, but one I was glad to return to the library.	2001-01-06

Especially noticeable is the &quot;Not Wolf&quot; story, and his essay on the importance of mercy.<br />This book is very refreshing and readable, the equivalent in book form of a five-minute shoulder massage, or a cup of tea on a rainy day.

Whether she is learning about child prostitution in Nepal, serving salad on the streets of San Francisco, or discussing the Vietnam War with Sister Chan Khong, Galland illustrates both the horrendous difficulties, pain and trauma these women face; and their remarkable courage in rising above them. Especially moving was the chapter on the Disappeared in Argentina.<br />This book highlights little-known or discussed issues facing women worldwide, and would be valued enough for that alone.  It also realistically grapples with the complicated structures of forgiveness, setting boundaries, and healing.  A superb spiritual work that crosses denominational lines.	2000-10-24

Of particular interest was the discussion on the whole interfaith issue; how hard both of them worked to maintain traditions on both sides; also, the shift in both of their perspective's on both women's and men's roles in marriage.<br />They also discuss such topics as divorce and blended families.  The chapter on divorce, in particular, seemed slightly sensationalized, and the examples extreme.  Both of the Roberts' are from the baby-boom generation, so for those not in this generation, this might not be as interesting or understandable.  It also raises the question as how those with fewer economic resources might achieve equality and parity in their marriages.  However, this was, overall, a very interesting and readable book.	2000-10-01

Although the title suggests this book refers to those  approaching or into mid or later life, Reverend Guenther suggests that the  &quot;second half of life&quot; can occur at any age - it is a mindset and  a change in focus, rather than an arrival at any specific  age.<br />Wonderfully written, this book speaks about spiritual direction,  craft, shifts in perspective and life; as well as discussing aging, both as  one who will eventually age, and one who has ministered to the aged.  Her  insights are sensitive and helpful, and the suggestions for ministry  practical and compassionate.  Her sections on spiritual direction do tend  toward a mainline Christian focus, not surprisingly, as Ms. Guenther is an  Episcopal priest.  An excellent, helpful book.	2000-09-09

The story is interesting, with several new characters,  especially Katherine and Hermes Aldaran.  My one quibble is that Marguerida  has retreated farther into the role of a proper Comyn lady, and both Gisela  and Katherine seem to be a bit more interesting. <br />The ending is  open-ended enough to allow for sequels, unfortunately, with the sad passing  of the great Marion Zimmer Bradley, it seems unlikely that it will  continue.

This is a fairly typical  Tristan-and-Isolde theme:  what saves it from the commonplace by Ms.  Bradshaw's beautiful writing, her clear, subtle world-building, and her  creation of layered, multi-leveled characters.  Elements of the  supernatural are introduced in a low-key and fairly believable way (insofar  as having conversations with ghosts are &quot;believable.&quot;)  A very  good, well-written, engaging story, with intriguing glimpses into the  pre-Christian world.	2000-08-23

Mandy is a strong, intelligent, courageous ten-year  old girl who lives in an orphanage.  More than anything else, she craves  something or someone to love and take care of.  One day, she is out for a  walk, and discovers an abandoned cottage.  I loved reading about her long  hours restoring the cottage, her life at the orphanage, and her other  adventures; and admired her strength, determination and perserverance.  Julie Andrews Edwards demonstrates she is a gifted a writer as she is an  actor and singer:  I only wish she had written more books like this!	2000-08-23

From drug addiction, to alcoholism:  through the deaths of her father and  best friend, and the birth of her son, Ms. Lamott traces her spiritual  journey in a series of moving, funny, and deeply personal anecdotes.  One  warning:  this book is probably not for those seeking a  traditionally-minded, conservative Christian memoir, as it is definitely  not either traditional or conservative! <br />For those whose faith is less  structured, this book is an incredibly funny, searingly personal and deeply  moving account of one woman's transformation through faith.  Ms. Lamott  possesses the rare gift of translating her faith into day-to-day  experiences and sharing her innermost, most difficult or stressful thoughts  in a very funny, realistic, human way.<br />Other readers have mentioned the  story of the woman in bicycle shorts (Ms. Lamott's \\"Enemy Lite.\\"), which is  truly hilarious.  Other highlights included the\\"celebration\\" of Ash  Wednesday, and her encounter with another Christian whose faith seemed to  be quite a different order from her own.  Ms. Lamott is also wonderful when  she writes about children:  whether about her own son or her friends'  children.<br />This would make a wonderful gift for those who are \\"teetering  on the edge\\" of Christianity, wondering, can this faith, this tradition  possibly ever mean anything to me?  Through these stories, Anne Lamott  illustrates the miracle that is her faith, and leaves the door open for  anyone who wants to follow.  A wonderful, inspiring and very funny book.	2000-08-17

Now that her year of probation is over,  Keladry is a full-fledged page.  Unfortunately, the harassment hasn't  stopped yet, but does slow down as she demonstrates her abilities again and  again.  <br />Some new characters appear, Owen, a younger page with a strong  case of hero worship, and Lalasa, a young palace servant whom Keladry hires  to protect from ill-treatment.  Nice to know Keladry hasn't slackened on  her ongoing quest to protect those around her from bullies.   One minor  point:  I still find myself wondering what happened to Princess Kalysin?   Wasn't she going to become a knight?  But, that aside, this is a terrific  book, and one point, toward the end, nearly reduced me to tears!

Although she offers plenty of practical  advice and suggestions, she avoids didactism, or lecturing.  Her use of  vignettes and stories are very helpful.<br />This book is invaluable both for  a would-be or practicing director (or so I would imagine), or anyone  currently receiving spiritual direction, or interested in pursuing it.  In  a very gentle, non-judgemental way, Ms. Guenther outlines stages, benefits  and limitations of spiritual direction. Her writing style is warm,  accessible, and engaging.

Although an interesting premise, this book  never really came together for me - was it science fiction, fantasy, or  just fiction?  The characters were a little too stock- the beleaguered  mother, the troubled daughter and the handsome professor who will make it  all better; not to mention the fact that the evil Bad Guys were so evil,  I'm surprised they weren't wearing black hats.  On the plus side, the book  contained a few nice bits, the plot was unusual, and the ending definitely  had an interesting twist.  Fair, but not great.	2000-08-14

Teacher, therapist and  theologian Kathleen Fischer looks at the various myths surrounding women  and anger in Western, particularly religious, culture, and does an  excellent job of deconstructing the myths, placing anger into context and  suggesting methods for integrating and dealing with this inevitable facet  of life.  <br />Especially helpful was her section on forgiveness, in which  she both warns readers as to the dangers of forgiving too soon, and shares  the painful, but liberating journey toward resolution.  The anecdotes she  shares, either personal, or from women who have shared them with her, are  very helpful and interesting.

God  loves you.&quot;  Working from that central premise, he goes on to discuss  what that means in terms of the community, the church, the Bible and the  world.<br />Those who espouse a more legalistic view of Christianity will  definitely have a problem with this book.  But for others, especially those  recovering from harm done in the name of religion, or those unsure as to  the relevance and meaning of the Christian faith, this book will serve as a  healing, refreshing and well-balanced look at some central truths in  Christianity.  A gentle and very sane book.	2000-08-02

The villians, with one or two exceptions, were fairly standard, cookie-cutter, &quot;bad guy&quot; types.  The heroes,  too, are typical De Lint:  one or two recovering types, a few morose guys  without a life, a few interesting standouts, and cameo appearances from  Angel and Jilly.<br />That being said, this is still a marvelous read:  the  supernatural characters are creepy and intriguing, Mr. De Lint's language  is, as always, superb, and some of the supporting characters, like  Bettina's abuela and the Aunts are very, very funny.  Mr. De Lint's focus  on personal choices and individual actions in the context of larger battles  between good and evil is always thought-provoking.  Especially gripping is  the realization that one can slip from a so-called &quot;normal life&quot;  into a vehicle for evil, almost without realizing it.  Or consenting to  it.<br />I almost gave this book four stars, due to its familiarity, but,  frankly, I find Mr. De Lint to be one of the finest writers in his field.   If he chooses to write the same sort of story in the next ten books he  writes, I will still probably read them.  I would like to hear more about  how the lives of Angel, Jilly, Geordie, etc. are &quot;going&quot; - maybe  we will need to wait for the next collection of short stories for that?  A  very, very good fantasy novel.	2000-07-28

Although she makes no secret of her political or spiritual  views, Dr. Chittister places them in context, sharing anecdotes and stories  as a means for getting her point across.  She also manages to detoxify such  &quot;buzz words&quot; as &quot;feminism&quot; and clarify why  &quot;Westernization&quot; meets with such strong resistance in other  cultures <br />In additioning to covering the &quot;same old ground&quot; (as  I've heard it described) of why traditional hurts women, Dr. Chittister  also illustrates how it harms men, society, and the earth; and points out  how it differs from the way Jesus related to people - inclusive, peaceful,  healing and compassionate.  This book points to a more respectful and open  theology.  A brilliant, balanced, and compassionate work.	2000-07-28

Sorcha's suffering is incredible, poignant, and grimly realistic.   Especially gratifying is the way suffering transforms the characters, for  good or for ill, and Ms. Marillier's refusal to adhere to traditional  stereotypes.  I look forward to the second volume.	2000-07-23

The society has some  striking parallels with nineteenth-century America, or South Africa under  apartheid; and the plot deals with important themes:  sexism, racism,  genocide, and social expectations.  Nolan is a very sympathetic character:   Kit, somewhat less so.  She seems to spend quite a lot of time rebelling  for the sake of rebelling.  I also did not understand why such an  intelligent woman was involved with such a cruel, violent person as Jex.  I  thought her character definitely came alive toward the end of the  novel.<br />Although this novel was very good, it lacked the emotional  intensity of her other works, which was why I rated it as four stars.   Good, but not as great as the superb Sharon Shinn usually writes.	2000-07-18

Her explanations surrounding the cultural gap  between the baby boomers and their aged parents are interesting, as are the  case studies, which are just grim enough to be realistic.  <br />A minor flaw  is that the book is very much focused on the boomers and *their* aging  parents, which makes its appeal to the non-boomer audience limited.  Added  to which, she does not cover the poor, destitute, or those who have no one  to support them.  A good book, if not as complete as it might have been.	2000-07-05

In &quot;King Kelson's Bride,&quot; Katherine Kurtz once again returns to the saga of Kelson Haldane, this time focusing on the ethronement of his vassal king, Liam of Torenth, and his search for a new bride.<br />This book  had several excellent points.  The cultural details and depiction of  Torenth are excellent.  Those in the &quot;buffer states&quot; of Orsal,  Forcinn, etc. are fleshed out.  Matyas in particular was an interesting,  well-drawn character, and Liam very believable.  I also enjoyed reading  about Jehana's progression.<br />However.  All of Ms. Kurtz's recent books  seem to suffer from a major flaw - the heros are models of perfection, the  villians, evil, scheming demons without one redeeming quality.  Camber had  his share of flaws, as did Morgan, in her earlier works, but not Kelson.   Frankly, the character of Conall was incredibly believable to me - who  wouldn't react against a pair of self-righteous noble demi-gods like Kelson  and Dhugal?  I was sorry when Ms. Kurtz killed him off.  Also, with the  addition of so many characters, familiar, well-loved ones were reduced to  cameo appearances - did Duncan even *speak* until the end of the book?   <br />As the Deryni Chronicles have progressed, one can see Ms. Kurtz's growth  as a writer and historian:  incidents are more fully fleshed out,  descriptions more interesting and detailed, situations more complex.   Unfortunately, her characters and plots have grown correspondingly less  interesting.  A good book with a good plot, but, I have to say, I agree  with the other writer who misses Morgan and Duncan in their heyday.	2000-07-03

Part social criticism,  part inspirational, part Buddhist history and theory, and part  psychological theory, the book never seemed to quite come together.  I  wanted to hear more about how to develop resilience, what cultivates it.  I  also felt that Dr. Young-Eisendrath could have expanded the parameters of  her research to include more than four individuals, interesting though  those were, and perhaps made her language a bit more universal, and watered  down some of her more critical opinions, which, in my opinion, detracted  from the overall effect of her book.	2000-07-01

Well-written, with a well-paced plot, lyrical flow, and gentle style.  <br />I could not, however, ever quite manage to transcend my  dislike for the main character.  Yes, Fran has been victimized, and, yes,  she has flaws and is imperfect and human like the rest of us.  Her  behavior, however, is so disjointed and dislikeable, it was impossible to  warm up to her, and a remark the character makes toward the end of the book  makes it clear she has learned nothing from her experience.  In her effort  to show the strained dance between abuser and abused, perpertrator and  victim, Ms. Quindlen creates a character who, despite her best efforts,  would enable the same behavior that nearly destroyed her.  <br />This story  left me with very little hope for any of the main characters.

These women are of  all ages and are drawn from all professions:  from art to politics; from  explorers to activists.  Some are famous and high-profile; some are  relatively unknown.  Each of these women has evinced a remarkable courage,  openness and determination not to give up her dream - whether writing about  the feminine identity of God, crossing the South Pole, or adopting a baby  girl from China.<br />Too often, as Mary Pipher (the author of &quot;Reviving  Ophelia,&quot; and one of the women profiled is this book) says, courage  has been defined as courage in the face of physical danger, the courage of  a superhero or of Rambo.  With this book, Ms. Martins suggests that courage  comes in many aspects, all of which are important and valuable.  I would  especially recommend this book as a gift to young women, although both  genders and all ages should find it enjoyable.	2000-06-26

William Countryman engages the topic of forgiveness from a gospel perspective, especially how it fits into the Christian life, and how it contributes to the &quot;forgiver's&quot;  sense of self, spirituality and quality of life.  Mr. Countryman neither  minimizes nor glosses away important issues such as abuse, pain, suffering,  anger or fear; nor does he participate in sugar-coating, guilt trips,  self-hatred, sanctimoniousness or denial.  <br />Instead, this work  illuminates the gradual, often difficult and painful, process of conversion  needed to experience God's love and forgiveness and the realization that  ultimately, every human being, each of us, will need to be forgiven for  *something*.  Mr. Countryman also reminds us that as we grow into our  experience of God's love, forgiveness becomes that much easier, an  extension of the wonderful love and support we feel.

According to author Ellen Snortland, women have been conditioned by society to believe that they are helpless in the  face of attack.

As a practicing martial  artist, all I can say is RIGHT ON to Ms. Snortland and all others like her  who strive to make this world a safer place for women, children and men  alike.  All girls, women, men, boys and everyone else who care about  women's safety, or who just want to understand the origins of violence in  our culture should have a copy of this book.

Although the primary focus is Christian, prayers from  other faith traditions are included.<br />This book is exquisite, to see and  touch as well as to read, and the prayers are beautiful.  Archbishop Tutu  prefaces each chapter with a meditation on the topic:  those alone are well  worth owning the book.  A wonderful collection.	2000-06-17

We see George Balanchine at the end of the career,  and such greats as Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins.  The incredible,  difficult, almost insane demands put on the dancers are clearly drawn, as  is Ms. Bentley's love for her art.  Especially evocative is her struggle  with reconciling art with her demanding profession.  <br />Often, artistic  memoirs focus on the superstars, the Tallchiefs and Nureyevs, for instance.   The view from the corps de ballet is all the more interesting for being so  rare.  This book is beautiful, wry, humorous and exquisitely-written.  I  wish Ms. Bentley had written several other volumes.	2000-06-17

In &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, Sharon Kay Penman concludes her Welsh trilogy, begun in &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; and continued in &quot;Falls the Shadow.&quot;  This tale chronicles the conflict between Llewelyn ap  Gruffydd and Edward I of England.  Llewelyn shines here; as in &quot;Falls  the Shadow&quot;, I found this character to be amazing and utterly  fascinating, and the love story between him and Ellen de Montfort was  exquisite and poignant.  Similarly, Daffydd ap Gruffydd's characterization  was marvelous.  <br />Ms. Penman's tendency to allow fictionalized characters  such as Hugh and Caitlin center stage, however, only detracts from her  novel.  This book is not for the faint of heart; the starkness of the  ending, fictionalized characters aside, was something that stayed with me a  long time.  A very good book, if lacking the power of the other two in the  trilogy.	2000-06-09

Included in this memoir is the erosion of  her career due to memory loss; her hospitalization and treatment, the  disintegration of her first marriage, and her slow, painful, climb back to  life.<br />This book testifies to both the worst and best of the human spirit:   agonizing, as one relives the abuse Ms. Cutting suffered, and heroic, as  she fights to reclaim her life and music.  The abuse she suffered becomes  all the more real under the dignified, poised and restrained words she  uses.  A deeply wrenching and uplifting book.	2000-06-09

Ms. Clark, as always, writes very well, but the  reason I rated this book as three stars was due to a very unlikely  coincidence, and a glaringly obvious flaw in the plot.

Ellen is determined to mine the details of Anne's life, to discover why it  was that her lover left her, and why he always returns to Anne.  In turn,  Ellen's arrival sends Anne into deep introspection: neither woman emerges  unchanged from their interaction.  LeCompte's imagery is beautiful, her  prose is smooth and finished, and the story is intriguing, although  occasionally slow-moving.  A very interesting and promising first novel,  which, unfortunately, has not been followed with any others.	2000-06-02

Rather than forming war crimes tribunals, rather than whitewashing or ignoring the past, the democratically-elected government, led by President  Nelson Mandela, formed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  In exchange  for amnesty, those guilty of war crimes were required to appear before the  commission and make a complete and full disclosure of any and all  atrocities committed, receiving in turn a full pardon.<br />This is extremely  difficult and painful reading.  The atrocities are grisly, and I only had  to read about them, not listen to them, nor experience them.  In clear,  unvarnished prose, Archbishop Tutu covers the difficulties in forming and  leading such a commission, the differences and problems the commission  members themselves had, and the response to it on the part of South African  citizens.  Yet, with all of the limitations Archbishop Tutu outlines, this  was a remarkable, hopeful, amazing process, unlike any in human history.   The book concludes with a fascinating, intriguing discussion on the nature  of forgiveness. A wonderful, painful and inspiring book:  one that shares  the best and worst of the human condition, written by a great moral leader  of our time.  This book should be required reading for every human being  alive.	2000-06-02

Jean Ferris does not moralize:  she does not skip over the obvious anguish every young woman must feel when  she is such a situation, nor does she whitewash Daphne's difficulties in  learning to trust and depend on the friends she gradually allows in her  life.

In &quot;The Serpent Garden,&quot; Judith Merkle Riley features another strong woman moving outside the constraints of her society; this one, a &quot;paintrix&quot; forced to support herself.  The supporting characters  are almost more interesting than Susanna and Ashton.  I especially liked  the portrayal of Bishop (later Cardinal) Wolsey before he fell from favor,  and Marguerite, later to be Queen of Navarre.  The descriptions of  day-to-day life are interesting and well-written, and the story flows  smoothly.<br />However.  This book suffers from what I call the &quot;third  act flaw.&quot;  This storyline is almost identical to &quot;The Oracle  Glass&quot; in that it follows the same pattern.  Plucky young woman is in  a difficult situation.  Plucky young woman discovers she has unique and  marketable abilities to resolve difficult situation.  As she grows in  prominence, plucky young woman finds herself accumulating enemies...  and  so on.  (Come to think of it, this plot also is similar to that of &quot;A  Vision of Light.&quot;)  Also, although Hadriel, the cherubs and the demons  were amusing, the supernatural elements in &quot;The Oracle Glass&quot; and  the Margaret of Ashbury books were both more subtle and more crucial to the  plot.  A nice read, with a nice ending, but not as good as her earlier  works.	2000-05-29

She shares stories about her  own insecurities, failings, and youthful assumptions which are as poignant  as they are funny.  The book is well-written, very entertaining, and is a  fast read, yet one you can come back to again.

The transcendental love Nouwen experiences, the peace and relaxation he  feels while ill, and the struggle to hang onto his new experiences after  recovering are believable, touching, and all too real.  This book would  make a wonderful gift for anyone facing a serious or life-threatening  illness, or those deeply frightened of dying.  I hope it comes back into  print soon.	2000-05-28

Each chapter covers a different aspect of the Rule, including such topics as prayer,  work, mindfulness, hospitality, peace, and listening.<br />Her stories from  the desert sages are wonderful and extremely funny, and several of her  insights are insightful and very helpful.  I found the chapter on obedience  in particular to be one of the most pithy, eloquent, and well-written  summaries on such a loaded topic that I have ever encountered.  One can  tell that she is a clinical psychologist from that chapter!<br />The only  criticisms I have are that the content is definitely dated:  many of her  specific images no longer apply, especially in world politics, her language  is occasionally didactic and flat.  &quot;Prayer is not magic.  Prayer is  not...&quot; and so on.  Also, a minor linguistic point:  she tends to  start each chapter with an image, relate the image to the topic, discuss  the topic, and then return to the image.  This is fine for occasional use,  but grates on repetition.  Also, those not familiar with Christianity,  especially with monastic communities might want to do some background  reading first, as some of the images are quite specific.  Overall, a very  interesting discussion on how to apply the Rule of St. Benedict to today's  world.	2000-05-27

He spotlights the uneasy mix between traditional Christian  faith and a modern world-view:  contrasting the seven-day creation story  with fossils dating back billions of years:  the understanding of Earth as  but one planet in one galaxy of millions are just two examples of the major  shifts in the world view that have taken place since the birth and death of  Christ.  <br />For those espousing Biblical literalism and fundamentalism,  this book will read like utter heresy.  For the true atheist, perhaps, it  will seem like goody-goody wishful thinking.  Yet, throughout it all, Spong  clings to the notion that God is Love, God is Life, God as the ultimate  Source of All, and urges people, Christians or not, to examine their  beliefs and enter into discussion and dialogue about what Christianity and  religion mean in the world today, and for the next millennium.  Even when I  disagree with Bishop Spong's conclusions, he makes me reevaluate my own  faith, and thus both stimulates and refreshes it.  I am grateful for this  book, even as it disturbs me.	2000-05-23

It is astonishing to discover just how much the two  religious leaders had in common, just how universal certain core truths  really are.<br />One minor quibble, however: I am not sure how our Islamic  sisters and brothers would feel hearing Jesus and Buddha being described as  *the* two greatest religious figures of human history.  Surely, Muhammed  must be up there as well?  Nonetheless, this book is fascinating and  excellent reading for contemplation.	2000-05-23

The interviews are  sensitive, interesting and well-conducted.  Ulstein seems, however, to shy  away from drawing conclusions based on his data, or from offering solutions  to these problems.  He also appears to have a bit of a religious agenda of  his own, in that he included many interviews with those who are still  practicing Christians, and fewer with those atheists or agnostics.  It  would be interesting to do a statistical survey to see how accurate the  percentage really is.  A good and interesting, if not great, book.	2000-05-23

Beautiful young dancer overcomes adversity, makes hard choices,eventually triumphs.  Beautiful descriptions of Venice, supportive secondary cast (for the most part), and  nice descriptions of dancing and the hard work it takes to get  there.<br />However.  The undertones are chillingly homophobic, the love  scene, though tender, was marred by Pippa's incredible stupidity - would  she really want to risk a pregnancy, in view of her attachment to ballet?   Granted, she is young and all that, but still!  Also, at her age, she might  have a great natural talent for singing, but it would be far too soon to  see if she could have a career in it, especially without serious study.   The average soprano voice does not develop until the early twenties at  least - and if Pippa really could sing the Doll Song, as depicted, she'd be  a prodigy in music as well as dance.  Finally, aside from her naivetie,  does Pippa have *any* faults?  I much prefer Ms. Godden's other works with  more realistic protagonists.	2000-05-22

In it, he describes his struggles with other people, his difficulty discerning what God intends for  him, the direction his ministry is to take, and, woven throughout the book,  are the continual, endless and beautiful themes of God's reconciling love,  the Eucharist, forgiveness, friendship and love.<br />It is especially  heartening (although sad for him) to read of his own struggles with others,  his sadness and depression, his occasional hurt feelings, and to know that,  great as he was, Nouwen struggled with the same problems of alienation and  sadness that afflict us all.  Yet, somehow, he found the strength to go on,  and to inspire millions.

It has also made me aware of how far we have to go!<br />I know many find him  disturbing, &quot;out there&quot;, a heretic, one who seeks the limelight  for its own sake.  The Bishop Spong who emerges in these pages, however, is  one deeply, passionately, and irrevocably dedicated, to inclusiveness,  justice, fairness, and the gift of love in Christ.  His willingness to  provide a voice for the disenfranchised, to put his career and life on the  line, time and again; and to use his considerable intellectual, spiritual  and leadership gifts toward these ends is nothing short of heroic.  The  saga of the 1998 Lambeth Conference was heartbreaking:  what sadness for  Bishop Spong to have to end his active career on such a note.  History will  be the judge, however.  His bravery, commitment and dedication to unpopular  and difficult causes will be long remembered.  An excellent, surprisingly  personal, autobiography.	2000-05-10
US	50109712	R342SPO0U0JX6N	0824515846	314182409	Voice From The Desert	Books	5	8	10	N	N	Luminous - true spirituality at its best	&quot;Voice from the Desert&quot; is a deceptively-simple, slight volume, in which Bishop Jacques Gaillot chronicles  his &quot;resignation&quot; from the see of Evreux, France; and his &quot;appointment&quot; as Bishop  of Partenia - a North African wasteland, now defunct.  With remarkably  little bitterness, this extraordinary man outlines his beliefs and the  actions which eventually led to his dismissal.  His resilience was such  that he established a cyber-diocese on the Internet, and thus can reach  millions of souls, where before he only reached thousands.  One can only  mourn for an institutionalized church which prizes doctrine, authority, and  image over the true, all-embracing and eternal love which Gaillot embodies  with every word.  My only regret is that he does not address the ordination  of women and the position of women in the Catholic church.  A beautiful,  inspiring and radiant book.	2000-05-08
US	50109712	R19VLITXE23K78	0848810856	475284066	Emily of Deep Valley	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A truly marvelous book	Maud Hart Lovelace spoke of &quot;Emily of Deep Valley&quot; as being her best book, and I can understand why.  The book may have been set at the turn of the last century, but Emily's problems are eternal:  loneliness,  shyness (especially with boys!), and uncertainty about what to do with her  life after high school.  How she deals with her problems and finds  happiness is a wonderful, very encouraging, story.  I loved the Betsy  stories, but truly empathized with Emily, as will anyone who was shy or  retiring in high school.  Please reprint it.	2000-05-03

Robb manages to pull a superb thriller out of her hat.  This is obviously a tribute to Dame Agatha Christie.   As a Christie-lover, the various references to her work made me smile throughout the book.<br />With a cameo appearance from Mavis, the reappearance of both  Charles Monroe and Officer Truehart, and the continually building  relationships, now between Peabody and McNab as well as Eve and Roarke, as  well as some interesting twists here and there, this book is definitely an  excellent read, with a very satisfying - and surprising - ending.  I hope  Ms. Robb continues to delve into Eve's and Roarke's pasts, especially since  she handles it with such sensitivity.  <br />I'm only sorry we have to wait to  read &quot;Judgement in Death.&quot;  The scene with Eve and the baby was  absolutely priceless.	2000-04-30

Farrell is a likeable, attractive young woman, and the way she struggles and works through her problems is realistic.  My one quibble is that the young male lead is  almost too good to be true.  A very good book.	2000-04-30

It provides both context and balance in discussing passages, analyzing the societies (Jewish, Roman, Early Christian and Hellenic) when the various epistles and Gospels were  authored.  Ms. Thurston discusses what is both said and unsaid, and  provides more accurate translations of some of the more controversial or  unclear language (i.e. diakonos).  Of particular interest for those seeking  further study is the bibliography included at the end of every chapter.  An  important and inspiring book.	2000-04-30
US	50109712	R2C07INPBK5QA5	0399145923	573580919	Carolina Moon	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Much better than the Reef!	This was one of Nora Robert's better recent efforts.  Her one fault is that once the abused heroine meets up with Mr. Right and they get together, she never again has any fallout from abuse - and that just would not happen  in real life!  For what it's worth, I thought the heroine reached out the  hero out of a need for affirmation that she was still alive, not out of  callousness or insensitivity, although I can understand why that could be  interpreted in that way.  I really enjoyed the character of Faith in  particular.	2000-04-28

The imagery is beautiful - angels, perfumed seas and so on - as are the prayers which are the only things worth reading in the book.  The instructions are vague,  and the message is lost somewhere in all of that rambling.  Not only is  this book sexist, it is cruelly insensitive to those not in relationship  (&quot;no one gets into heaven alone&quot;), and also ignores those who  might have alternative lifestyles.  She should have just published the  prayers.	2000-04-22

This book is a story of a young woman's  triumph over adversity: difficult family circumstances, near-abuse and  drugs.  Very moving and incredible read.	2000-04-22
