It is a 'saga'.  It doesn't seem like a 'bad' book, just not one I am interested in. <br /> <br />Back Cover: <br /> <br />They agreed to share their lives...but what about their hearts? <br /> <br />To Kit Sheridan, Chapel House is a haven.  A Jersey Shore mansion overlooking the ocean, it is inhabitied by a group of close friends and seems the perfect spot to recover from her divorce. <br /> <br />When Cole Perelle, a young doctor, arrives at the beach house, he and Kit immediately strike up a special, close friendship. <br /> <br />It is a friendship so valuable that neither is willing to risk it by acting on the intense attraction that develops between them.  Their intertwined lives begin to echo the rhythms of the waves on the beach as they come together, pull away and come together again.  But like a forceful wave, Kit and Cole's passions inevitably crash, forcing them to choose between certainty and doubt...between love and all else.	2005-05-29

But as I am clearing out my bookshelves, I found I never 'read' this book, just skimmed through.  Therefore, I am not keeping it.  I am not very interested in ' terrible misunderstanding' themes. <br /> <br />The back blurb: <br /> <br />Badder Than Before <br />Years ago, teenage Nicki Lockwood had been the only one in town to see past Travis Halloran's bad-boy leather jacket and tough talk--until she'd seen just how bad he was.  He'd carelessly caused her father's death, then lied and denied it.  And now Travis was back, ready to do even more damage. <br /> <br />To save one of their own, the mighty Lockwoods had destroyed Travis Halloran.  And as he'd rotted in jail, he'd called himself every kind of a fool for believing that wealthy, wide-eyed Nicki would know he wasn't guilty.  Now, at last, he could prove his innocence.  But his proof was worthless because the truth would destroy Nicki--the woman he'd waited forever for...	2005-05-28

This novel tells the 24 hour drama of three generations of women family members.  I really enjoyed the beginning of the book and laughed out loud at some parts throughout the book.  However, this book does repeat itself (character dialoge) that was uninteresting the third time you read it.  This may be how people really speak, but it is annoying when reading it over a couple days.  For instance, the line &quot;You know, children don't take after strangers&quot;  is brilliant!  But the third time I read it, well, it lost its punch.  All in all, I would recommend the book.  In particular, all three spirits were exceptional written, I enjoyed the grandmother Lily, didn't 'appreciate' the daughter Sandra and was truly 'scared' of the granddaughter LaShawndra.  She is a segment of today's generation that is absolutely every parents nightmare.  But she is real!  And for that I give Ms. Ansa all the credit.	2003-04-19

I finally finished reading it because I didn't have much else to read.  It wasn't a bad story.  Sensuality level was on the mark, but... it just wasn't a great story.    However, I am in the minority and you should try this book.  I usually love the 'family' novels, especially when you get to revisit characters.  But this time it just felt too forced.  I enjoyed 'The Winston Brothers' much more although by necessity the stories were short.	2003-04-19

This is her debut and it is wonderful.  <br />Back Cover<BR>Opposites Attract<BR>Attorney Cole Cassidy knew Brenna James had no reason to like him, much less trust him.  After all, he'd almost sent her to jail.  But when fate threw him back into her life, he seized the moment to get closer to the mysterious, beautiful, innocent waitress.  And never had anyone been more determined to uncover Miss James's secrets...<br />Never in her life had Brenna felt so off-balance.  She'd spent years keeping secrets and trusting her instincets.  Which would she believe now?  Instincts that warned her of danger and urged her to run?  Or instincts that were drawn to the caress of Cole's hands and eyes, promising compassion and understanding?  Either way, Brenna was faced with the threat...of falling in love.<br />The back cover can't give justice to how good the writing is in this book.  It is a totally believable story with real people (the supporting characters are excellent), issues and resolutions.   Everything does not work out 'perfectly'.  Ms. Mignerey has written a complex book that works on all levels.  I do not want to give any details because the book evolves beautifully and you should experience it first hand. I read it in one day and half the night.  I can't wait for the other two books to arrive.	2003-01-05

But when the famous film star finally found Christy Reno, nothing could convince her that he wanted her for keeps, nothing could prove to her that she need never again face life's storms alone.<br />Christy had thought of Trace every day for the past three years, and she thought of him now every time she looked into her daughter's eyes--eyes that were so like the child's famous father's.  But Christy could never be part of this man's world.  And she was determined to hold fast to what she had--even if it meant losing the only man she had ever loved.&quot;<br />This storyline has been done a million times:  a rendevous and subsequent child.  But this is the first time it has been done with believable reasons why the mother did not tell the father.  This story is gripping in its emotions, description of the storm and its characters.  You would make the same decisions Christy did based on her history.  And Trace was allowed the time to grow (3 years) without it seeming like a 'miracle' had taken place.  The love scenes were also right on mark.  They were real!  This is a fantastic book you should not miss.	2002-09-15

After a reread, I am not quite sure why, but it is definitely worth reading.  Interesting characters and not a typical 'romance' ending plot.  The subplot with bad guys features real bad stuff.  Alicia is smart and perhaps Jason was the reason I didn't immediately take to this book.  He seemed a little too naive.

But that was before her husband's violent treachery forced Olivia to take her young son and flee in the middle of the night.  Now, living under an assumed name in a small town far from the bright lights of L.A., the last thing Olivia needs is to call attention to herself--or to get involved with anyone again. So when she rescues two young children from drowning, she suddenly finds herself in the media spotlight.  For the spirited twins turn out to belong to the mysterious Max Rothwell, a brooding, reclusive man Olivia finds herself irresistibly attracted to.<br />Haunted by his own secrets and the tragic death of his wife, Max wants nothing to do with romance.  Though he's drawn to Olivia's quiet strength and compassionate nature, something tells him she's not who she appears to be.  What begins as a reluctant truce soon grows into a sensual longing, bringing two wounded souls together in a tender passion that may heal them both if they can learn to trust in their hearts...&quot;<br />This is my first book by Wendy Morgan and with a 5 star rating will not be the last.  I thought the characters and storyline were freshly written, although the storyline has been used many times.  This is not a rehash of last decade's run of the mill story.  The 'twists' to the story were realistic!  Wow, finally a writer that writes about things going wrong and knowing we the reader will still get our 'retreat from reality fix'.  I applaude Ms. Morgan on her courage, even though we know it will turn out alright.  Hey, this is still category romance.  :)  Ms. Morgan also writes under another name.  That information can be found when you purchase this book.	2001-11-18

Uh-oh!  Runaway bride on her honeymoon alone at his Lazy O Dude Ranch!  Luke knew too well what happened when he comforted a sobbing woman, and no way was sweet Josie Randall getting anywhere near his strong shoulders...<br />Josie's two-timing groom-not-to-be had done her a huge favor.  She'd never even imagined she could love a man so much, until she'd looked into Luke's dark brown eyes and saw forever.  But how was a woman to convince six feet, two inches of nonmarrying man that she was the woman he didn't even know he was waiting for?&quot;<br />I bought this book solely on the writer being Robin Wells, who wrote 'Baby, Oh Baby'.  Unfornately, this book is not of the same caliber.  The 'conflict' seemed forced and took a whole book to resolve.  Luke's 'oh shucks' demeanor was not attractive.  It turned me off that a grown man would use phrases like 'oh criminy' or 'good gravy'.  I wouldn't speak to this guy!  :)  This story seemed old although written in 1997.  I read this book months ago and didn't want to write a poor review, but after looking through this again...this is my honest opinion.  Buy 'Baby, Oh Baby'.  That is a wonderful book.	2001-11-18

I wouldn't buy it today, because it's just too implausible for the female lead to have been so wimpy.  But that was a big story line 20 years ago.

I wouldn't buy it today, because it's just too implausible for the female lead to have been so wimpy.  But that was a big story line 20 years ago.  Now it is easy to get strong characters (women and men).  But with all that, I really liked this story.  See if you can get it at the library.	2001-08-13

This book is so well written that there aren't any secondary characters.  Every character enriched the whole.  These are 'Real People' folks.  I couldn't put this book down and read it in one sitting (okay I feel asleep in bed, but that was not by choice).  Stop reading the reviews and read the book.  It is excellent!  <br />Thank you Ms. Wells.  I was getting discouraged reading 'new' authors.  You have restored my faith.  Imagine, I have had this book for weeks and just happened to find it under previously read titles.  I am ordering 'Prince Charming' today.	2001-08-11

Therefore, it is always hard for me to believe they can 'fall in love' with such callous men.  That being said, this is a pretty good historical.  But I won't keep it.  It is not a book I would pick up and reread because it was so great.  Again, the problem is not in the writing, but my own tastes.	2001-08-04

And I love &quot;unrealistic, why are they together&quot; stories as much as the next avid reader.  But this is a beautifully written, lyrical feast.  I really appreciated the descriptive language.  I loved how this story slowly unfolded.  Not my usual style, but good writing wins every time.	2001-07-29

There are quite a few reviews on it, so I will not expand on the story.  Surfice to say, some loved it and some didn't.  If you like my other picks you will probably like this.  It's different from what I usually read, but it was fun.  Definitely a keeper!	2001-07-28

Especially for a short novel.  You felt the love blossom and there weren't any contrived 'misunderstandings'.  These were real characters with real flaws and concerns.  And I loved the fact that the single mother was not portrayed as helpless or a victim.  Kudos to Nora (again!).	2001-07-24

Thank you unknown reviewer!  This is one of the best books (series) I have read.  Rafe is a traditional male lead (bad boy), but the characters are fleshed out so well the old formula is still interesting.  I read the series in order, but I am rereading out of order a month later and the books truly hold on their own.  I really liked this book, but I can't say it is my favorite.  They are all so good, I think of them as one continuous story.  And wouldn't it be nice (and profitable) for them to be re-released together.  I don't think in the last 6 years there have been that many better books.  Once again...Why is this out of print? :)	2001-07-24

I was just browsing thru the book (I read it a month ago) in order to refresh my memory before I wrote this review.  I ended up rereading the book.  Nora is the best.  I can't wait to refresh myself with the other brothers' stories.  However, this story will be hard to beat.  It may be my favorite.  Series (3 of 4)	2001-07-21

Sorry, I really liked \\"Deep Waters\\", but I probably won't buy another JAK unless I am stuck at an airport and I have read every other available Romance, Mystery or Thriller on the newsstand.  I think I have made myself clear.  It is time for me to find some new talented authors.  Although I know I have some previously read titles of hers to review.

It is like your first love, you really are 'in love', but later on you wonder...was it just because it was my first experience?  I liked this story because it was DIFFERENT.  Lizzy was not a perfect raving beauty.  Still rare for the romance genre.	2001-07-17

This is the most sensual, erotic, Romance I have read.  It has set the standard and I fear it will not be matched many times.  I am buying her two other books and late this year another is coming out.  I won't even read the reviews before I purchase it.  A definite keeper I will read again and again.	2001-05-28

In fact, I will let you know when I don't like an LH book.  I think she is a great writer. I haven't read all her work (and I don't really want to at this time), but she is so far ahead of most other writers that I think she is held at a different standard.  Reading the reviews won't really help.  There are over 100.  Try this book.  If you don't like it, don't take my opinion again.  :)	2001-05-24

Cleopatra's eccentric nature became tiresome after a while.  Not my style.  However, I enjoyed both Paula Detmer Riggs and Carole Buck very much.  Enough to try other work by them.  CB's story was very good because the woman wasn't perfect (size 6, etc.) and came to realize her own beauty.  I really enjoyed this story the best.  PDR's story showed a man's side of pain and how he needed to heal before he could move on with his life.  These stories were a nice departure from typical storylines.  Overall, I would keep this book because it is different from what I normally read.	2001-05-22

My review would be bulls eyed to 4 reviewers (Desmond/Singapore, lieslt/NYC, Sooz/DC and Elizabeth/midwest).  JAK's style is hit or miss (to me!).  But this is a hit.  Definitely an author most people love or hate, with some of us middle folk that just like a good story.  I do understand why this book could be irritating.  But I still would recommend it.	2001-05-13

It wasn't terrible, but after this second reading I wouldn't read it again.  Safe to say I didn't like Oliver (and yes I can understand how he became the control freak he was) and Annie wasn't particularly bright either (no excuse I can think of for that).  JAK's characters/books can be repetitious.  But I do like some of her writing.  I just won't buy any more at this time.	2001-05-12

But JAK is such a good writer that I still liked the book.  But there really needed to be more development of the relationship before/after marriage.

A Keeper	I usually cannot tolerate historicals because the female leads are fluff.  This is not the case in this book.  I loved it.  It was not formula writing.  The path was not smooth for Derek and Sara to get together.  And it was believable.  Sara TRIED to make it work in her old life!  How often do you see that situation in a Romance?  That is real life.  And I have come to realize I appreciate it when the author goes beyond 'I love you' to how to live together in that love.  That is the real test of love and creates a much more interesting and balanced story.  A definite keeper.	2001-04-29
