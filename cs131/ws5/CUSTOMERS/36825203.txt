Before I read this book, all I really knew about the Supreme Court was that it was  powerful, and that appointments to the Court were for life.  After reading this outstanding book by a true Constitutional scholar, I have a much better appreciation of the Court's role and I understand why there is so much Congressional interest in and political rhetoric about President Bush's two recent Supreme Court nominations.   <br /> <br />Levin made extensive use of our Founding Fathers' historical documents to analyze the Court's actions and decisions.  The main purpose of his analysis was to show the ideological differences between conservative judicial originalists (judges who \\"look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of the framers when deciding a constitutional question\\") and liberal judicial activists (judges who \\"consider the Constitution a document of broad principles and concepts, one that empowers them to substitute their personal beliefs, values, and policies for those enumerated in the Constitution\\").  Levin is a staunch judicial originalist who sees judicial activists as a serious threat to our freedoms.   <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Levin presented a strong case with many examples to support his position that the tyrannical Court has assumed authority not granted to it, and has usurped authority granted to Congress, the President, and the states.  His examples were very effective, especially when he quoted from actual Court opinions and decisions.  I often had to read those Court quotes more than once (or twice) to try and understand their logic.  Levin's analysis and commentary leading up to and following the quotes really helped me to understand the significance of those Court opinions and decisions. <br /> <br />Levin's well-documented depiction of a Supreme Court out-of-control and out-of-touch with our Nation's core beliefs and governmental principles should be a wake-up call for all Americans.    <br />	2005-10-12

Forty-five black-and-white photos perfectly complemented the emotion-packed pages of one-liners that all began with, \\"A son needs a dad...\\"   <br /> <br />For me, this book was pregnant with meaning.  Many times I was compelled to pause and reflect, often with misty or tearful eyes.  I found two one-liners that had a significant impact on me, and believe they will continue to have a significant impact on me as a dad throughout the years to come: <br /> <br />\\"A son needs a dad...to be the role model for the father he will become.\\" <br /> <br />\\"A son needs a dad...because without him he will have less in his life than he deserves.\\" <br />	2005-09-28

The result was a book with a lot of potential for all organizations and their leaders to improve their individual and collective effectiveness and competitiveness. <br /> <br />This book offered a detailed, holistic approach to what it takes to effectively get things done.  The authors included many great examples (especially the letter to a new leader at the very end of the book), and years of personal observations to reinforce their disciplined execution culture perspective.  Some of the main points repeated throughout the book were the critical role of leadership in fostering honest, accurate, and constructive communications at all levels; a constant emphasis on accountability and follow-through; and how learning how to ask great, probing questions with a purpose can lead to the type of dialogue at any level that will bring reality into focus so effective decisions can be made. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who has ever looked at his/her organization with pride and thought, \\"There is absolutely nothing we cannot do,\\" or with disgust and wondered, \\"Can we ever do anything right?\\"  This book can help you understand the \\"why\\" behind both extremes and possibly give you a new way of looking at and putting to use some well-known, common-sense ideas.     <br />	2005-07-05

What made this book really stand out from other business-oriented books was how applicable the approach, advice, and conclusions were to all organizations -- large or small, public or private, profit or non-profit -- and to individuals' personal lives. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about what it takes to transform yourself and your organization from mediocrity to greatness. <br /> <br />This book is a detailed and well-documented study about the differences between good and great. Collins and his team of researchers and analysts used a common-sense research methodology and readily available data on public companies for their study.  From those dry, humble beginnings, Collins transformed his team's efforts into rich and dynamic principles about life and organizations that can propel both from being just good to being truly great.  <br /> <br />According to Collins, \\"I like to think of our work as a search for timeless principles - the enduring physics of great organizations - that will remain true and relevant no matter how the world changes around us...That good is the enemy of great is not just a business problem. It is a `human' problem. If we have cracked the code on the question of good to great, we should have something of value to any type of organization.\\" <br /> <br />The book's chapters were sequential and based upon what Collins and his team learned about the journey to greatness. Each chapter contained facts, stories, statistics, and credible analysis, and ended with a summary of two distinct parts: key points and unexpected findings. While the key points were critical to reinforcing the chapters' material, I thought the unexpected findings were invaluable in exposing the common myths and misperceptions about greatness that Collins' research disproved. <br />  <br />I can honestly say that the book's content and Collins' easy-to-understand writing style kept me interested and fully engaged from cover to cover - the lines and margins of my book have my highlights, underlines, and extensive notes to prove it!  In the last six pages before the epilogue, Collins explained the broader, universal context of his work and showed how and why it can be applied to individuals and all organizations. Those very focused and powerful pages helped solidify in my mind why I consider this book one of the best and most important books I have ever read. <br />	2005-01-25

Whether you are already familiar with the extraordinary life and career of Coach Wooden, or you are looking for a quick biography-like synopsis of Coach Wooden's incredible story, or even if you have never heard about Coach Wooden, this book can inform, inspire, and entertain you. <br /> <br />This book contains over 200 quotes by and about John Wooden, the greatest college basketball coach of all time (10 national championships in 12 years, including 7 in-a-row and an 88-game winning streak), and, more importantly, one of the greatest teachers of morals, character, and life values.  As a long-time fan of Coach Wooden, I was impressed with how the selected quotes accurately captured the essence of Wooden the Coach, and Wooden the Man. The chapter titles provided a great working outline of Wooden's life and the teaching environments from which he has taught, and continues to teach, so many life lessons to so many people over the last 60+ years: Indiana Years, Early Westwood Days, Practices, Games, Dynasty, Teacher, Pupils, Philosophy, Retirement, Tributes, The Game Today, and Family. <br /> <br />Although best known for his accomplishments on the basketball court, by far Wooden's greatest contributions have been made off the court.  Reger's skillful selection of personal snapshots and anecdotes from and for Coach Wooden truly show how positively influential one person can be in the lives of others.  Reger accurately assessed Coach Wooden's character and influence and paid the ultimate compliment to Wooden the Man when he wrote, \\"This world would be a better place if there were more human beings like John Wooden.\\" <br />	2005-01-21

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in business and in Life	Books	5	3	6	N	N	Deeply Personal & Broadly Universal	I wish someone had told me a while ago, \\"Go out and buy and read this book...It could have an instant, dramatic, and positive influence on your life.\\"  I did buy and read this great book, and it has begun to change my life in some very positive ways.  In fact, I think so much of this book that I have shared it with my boss (who loved it) and we have bought it and shared it with everyone in our office. <br /> <br />Miller's common-sense approach to addressing the deeply personal and broadly universal character issue of personal accountability was both refreshing and enlightening. The book is a series of short, simple, and inter-related chapters that discuss or illustrate different thoughts and perspectives about personal accountability.  The chapters contain many outstanding stories, anecdotes, and personal experiences of people making a difference through personal accountability.  Many times I personally related to the questions and situations Miller presented.   <br /> <br />According to Miller, the essence of QBQ is making better choices in the moment by asking better questions. Instead of asking lousy questions that do not solve anything -- \\"Why don't they communicate better?\\" or \\"Who dropped the ball?\\" or \\"Who is going to solve this problem?\\" - Miller argues for questions that begin with \\"What\\" or \\"How,\\" contain \\"I,\\" and focus on action - \\"How can I make a difference?\\" or \\"What can I do to contribute?\\"  Miller's argument was a great complement to Stephen Covey's first habit (of 7) of highly effective people (being proactive; being responsible for making good things happen in your life) and Viktor Frankl's last of the human freedoms (being able to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances). <br /> <br />Lastly, I believe Miller intended this book for individuals who are serious about introspection for the sake of character refinement and life improvement.  I love challenges, and I took Miller's words that follow as a constructive challenge that I have gladly accepted:  <br /> <br />\\"Learning is not attending, listening or reading.  Nor is it merely gaining knowledge.  Learning is really about translating 'knowing' what to do into 'doing' what we know.  It's about changing.  If we have not changed we have not learned.  What have you learned today?\\" <br />	2005-01-16

Well, I sure am glad nobody told me exactly what the book was about because I not only bought it and read it, I thought it was an outstanding book.   <br /> <br />\\"Oxymoronica,\\" a new term introduced by Dr. Mardy Grothe and the title of this book, was defined inside the front cover as \\"any variety of tantalizing, self-contradictory statements or observations that on the surface appear false or illogical, but at a deeper level are true, often profoundly true.\\"   <br /> <br />In keeping with that definition, the book contained over 1,400 oxymoronic and paradoxical quotations from ancient times to today, organized into fourteen categories, most of which you would expect to find in any standard book of quotations (i.e. advice; insults; politics; sex, love, and romance; marriage, home, and family life).  Complementing the wit and wisdom of the quotations was Grothe's historical and cultural research and his ability to present and put into a logical, often humorous, context the quotations so that I could reflect on and appreciate their profound meanings.  You can open the book at random or read it sequentially and get the same pleasant experience both ways. <br /> <br />I had many profoundly personal moments of reflection on people and events in my life throughout the pages of this book: <br /> <br />\\"Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's own ignorance.\\"  Confucius <br /> <br />\\"You can't make anything idiot-proof because idiots are so ingenious.\\"             Ron Burns <br /> <br />\\"The child is father of the man.\\"  William Wordsworth <br /> <br />\\"When you add to the truth, you subtract from it.\\"  From the Talmud <br /> <br />\\"He had nothing to say and he said it.\\"Ambrose Bierce, on a contemporary <br /> <br />\\"I learned an awful lot from him by doing the opposite.\\"                               Howard Hawkes, on Cecil B.

I recommend it to brand-new leaders to help lay a solid leadership foundation upon which to build, and to seasoned leaders and managers interested in sharpening their leadership skills and refining their approach to leadership. <br /> <br />This book is a series of interdependent philosophical essays that are part of a holistic view of effective leadership.  DePree defines the art of leadership as \\"liberating people to do what is required of them in the most effective and humane way possible,\\" and that definition is a theme that runs throughout the book.  Another closely related common theme in these non-sequential yet complementary essays is that leaders must abandon themselves to the strengths of others in order to serve them and allow them to realize their full potential. <br /> <br />DePree put a lot of emphasis on people and fostering leadership environments in which trusting, respectful, and effective relationships flourish.  His ideas and beliefs about leadership, some that I have never really read anywhere else, were refreshing and stimulating.  One largely ignored insight that particularly stood out to me was that \\"much of a leader's performance cannot be reviewed until `after' the fact.\\"  In today's common short-term focus/instant gratification world, such insights deserve our uncommon attention.    <br /> <br />Although originally published in 1989, DePree's thoughts, ideas, and approach to leadership are timeless.  While some people may argue that DePree's writings are idealistic, I found them to be realistic given the nature of people and the frenetic pace of our hyper-competitive professional environments.  Every leader owes it to him- or herself, and to those who allow themselves to be led, to read and reflect on the leadership wisdom contained in this small and powerful book.   <br />	2004-10-26

Dobson fervently believes his understanding of Judeo-Christian parenting concepts from Scripture are as valid today as they were for our ancestors. <br /> <br />Although the title may seem to imply cruelty or harshness, Dobson goes out of his way many times to clearly denounce any excessive or abusive applications of discipline on children.  Dobson advocates giving children definite boundaries with certain consequences for certain actions and behaviors, and establishing those boundaries while children are young.  His \\"5 Points to Commonsense Parenting (1- Developing respect for parents is the critical factor in child management, 2- The best opportunity to communicate often occurs after a disciplinary event, 3- Control without nagging, 4- Don't saturate the child with materialism, and 5- Establish a balance between love and discipline),\\" are great guidelines for creating and sustaining those boundaries.   <br /> <br />Besides presenting in-depth perspectives on the parent-child relationship, Dobson presented his moral and disciplined perspectives on schools teaching and children learning, sex education for children, the special needs and responsibilities of moms, and the signs and dangers of drug use in children.  He finished most chapters with a series of practical questions and answers that deepened my understanding of the material in those chapters. <br /> <br />Dobson took many morally courageous positions throughout the book, and was not afraid to speak out against what he thought were hurtful or immoral common practices.  The best example of this moral courage was his direct challenge of safe-sex advocates.  He included a powerful 1992 \\"USA Today\\" full-page ad from his \\"Focus on the Family\\" organization titled, \\"In Defense of a Little Virginity,\\" that confronted typical sex education \\"safe-sex\\" myths with the documented facts of teenage sexual health risks.  <br /> <br />This book contains a wealth of Dobson's morally-sound, common-sense wisdom and years of experiences with children, parents, and families--a handy reference that I will use frequently.  <br />	2004-09-23

Lutz, Chairman of General Motors North America.  This revised and updated book contains the blunt, honest wisdom of an authentic maverick leader in the form of his laws of business that have stood the test of time over his thirty years in the car industry, and his rise to the top of Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.    Organized into three parts, the book opens with the story of Chrysler's second turnaround in the early 1990s.  Lutz was part of the executive team that conceived and brought to life one of the most famous and successful muscle cars of all-time: the Viper.  Part Two is an in-depth review and validation of Lutz's eight immutable laws of business.  The final part is Lutz's corollaries to his laws, or, as he calls them, \\"The Rest of the Story!\\"    A former Marine with an ongoing, life-long love affair with the Marine Corps and its leadership practices, Lutz presented many business and leadership concepts and personal anecdotes that reflected and blended his business and Marine Corps backgrounds.  From his beliefs about the need for attention to detail and critical performance evaluations, to his emphasis on holistic, empowered, cross-functional teams and the value of a culture that nurtures middle-management dissent of conventional wisdom in open forums, Lutz's insights and experiences were both entertaining and informative.           If the following lists of Lutz's business laws and corollaries even sound remotely appealing to you, read this book - you will not be disappointed.     Lutz's Immutable Laws of Business:  LAW #1: The Customer Isn't Always Right  LAW #2: The Primary Purpose of Business Is Not to Make Money  LAW #3: When Everybody Else Is Doing It, Don't!

As Freedman noted in his introduction, \\"...the Marines have specialized in operating under chaotic, fast-changing, high-intensity conditions that provide not only little way of knowing what the opposition is going to throw at you but perhaps no way of knowing exactly who the opposition is going to be... Everything about the Marines--their culture, their organizational structure, their management style, their logistics, their decisionmaking process--is geared toward high-speed, high-complexity environments.  It's Darwinian....\\"  <br /> <br />As a career Marine officer, I found Freedman's descriptions and explanations of Marine practices and thought processes about 95% accurate.  The book is filled with many quotes by and references to many Marines I know directly, know of indirectly, or know by reputation, that brought the principles to life.  In short, he captured the true essence of what makes the Marine Corps a good source of ideas and philosophies about leadership and management, in both the military and the civilian business worlds. <br /> <br />Effectively applying these Marine principles to the business environment requires judgment and understanding, and should be expected to vary from organization to organization.  The Marines' military model will not fit every situation for every organization, but I believe most organizations would serve themselves and their customers well by learning how and why the Marines have been so successful in a very similar operating environment. <br /> <br />Let me share with you four of the best principles, in Freedman's words, that I have personally seen work time and time again throughout my career: <br /> <br />*Aim for the 70-percent solution: It's better to decide quickly on an imperfect plan than to roll out a perfect plan when it's too late. <br />*Task organize: The size and make-up of groups within the organization should be changed according to the needs of each specific mission. <br />*Manage by end state and intent: Tell people what needs to be accomplished and why, and leave the details to them. <br />*Demand to be questioned: Subordinates should feel free to openly disagree with their managers, up until it comes time to carry out a final and legitimate decision. <br />	2004-08-09

Once I have made that mental connection, I am compelled to discover why that book has influenced so many different people.  Viktor Frankl's &#34;Man's Search for Meaning&#34; is one of those influential books, and now I know why -- it is one of the best, thought-provoking, and potentially life-changing books I have ever read.  Frankl was a Holocaust survivor who used his concentration camp experiences as a laboratory to study the nature and character of man.  Frankl went on to become a world-renowned psychiatrist whose thoughts developed a new psychotherapy called logotherapy. He believed man's main concern in life is in fulfilling a meaning that is unique only to him, that each life has its own specific meaning, and that everyone is responsible for his own life and existence.  The book was broken down into two complementary chapters, and a postscript (revised edition).  In the first chapter, &#34;Experiences in a Concentration Camp,&#34; Frankl shared his thoughts and observations as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps.  The descriptions of his life and the lives and actions of his fellow prisoners was authentic, yet not as overly graphic as other Holocaust accounts I have read.  In the second chapter,  &#34;Logotherapy in a Nutshell,&#34; Frankl gave a scholarly explanation of logotherapy.  While some of the more academic terms and concepts were difficult to understand at first and required me to re-read some sections, he gave sufficient examples that helped me to get his main points.  The postscript was titled, &#34;The Case for a Tragic Optimism,&#34; and was based on a lecture Frankl gave in 1983.  Frankl defined &#34;tragic optimism&#34; as &#34;...an optimism in the face of tragedy and in view of the human potential which at its best always allows for: (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt theopportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life's transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.&#34;  The postscript helped me to better understand some of the more difficult connections between the first two chapters.  Throughout this book, I found many spiritual and thought-provoking quotes and passages that made reading it a very personal and reflective experience for me: &#34;He who has a 'why' to live can bear with almost any 'how.'&#34;  Friedrich Nietzsche &#34;We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread.  They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.&#34; &#34;Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.&#34; &#34;...the commonplace truth that no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.&#34; &#34;Man is 'not' fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them.  In other words, man is ultimately self-determining.  Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.&#34; &#34;Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now.&#34; &#34;In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured.&#34;  I consider my life to be a constant work-in-progress, so this book is on my short list of books that I plan to read again and again to help me keep my life focused and meaningful.	2004-06-17

Starting with the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks (Hannity's radio show began on Sept. 10, 2001), Hannity related how liberal thinking helped make those attacks more likely and how that same liberal thought process undermines traditional American values and threatens our basic freedoms and liberty.  In detailed discussions about issues like taxes, welfare, defense, families, religion, abortion, character, leadership, education, intelligence, immigration, the media, patriotism, the environment, and civil liberties, Hannity was very clear in his opinions of what is right and what is wrong.  Hannity wrote with the same candid passion and conservative perspective that have made him one of the country's most popular radio and television political commentators.  The book was well-written and well-documented.  Whether or not you agree with Hannity's beliefs or style, this book will provide a great snapshot of the American political differences between liberals and conservatives in the early 21st century.  What you get out of this book should not surprise you if you know for what it is you are looking.  If you are a conservative, this book will entertain you and reinforce many (if not all) of your values and beliefs.  If you are a liberal, this book will probably upset you, but it will give you tremendous insight into the heart and soul of conservative political thinking.  If you are undecided, this book makes a very compelling case for rejecting liberalism and embracing conservatism.  Regardless of your political preferences, this book is worth reading and discussing.	2004-05-18

I soon discovered an outstandingly balanced and informative organizational leadership book that took an honest military leadership perspective and effectively applied it directly and indirectly to civilian business environments.  This real-world leadership book should appeal to any military-related person and anyone interested in better understanding the military and business leadership connection.  This book was written by a brother duo, one a successful corporate executive and the other an experienced SEAL officer.  In their introduction, they accurately assessed what made the book stand apart from other leadership books I have read: &#34;Be forewarned: This book does not pay homage to godlike CEOs, legendary generals, and other corporate cult figures.  It is our view that masterful leadership and effective teams, not colorful mavericks, produce success...Every great leader has a great team above, around, and behind him or her...[The book is] a collection of lessons from SEAL training and SEAL operations that have been tested in the business world.&#34;  The book is broken down into six chapters (Setting Goals, Organization-Create Structure or Fight Alone, Leadership-The Hardest Easy Thing, The Thundering Herd, Building a Thundering Herd, and Now Maintain Your Momentum), with embedded lessons related to each chapter title.  Each lesson starts with a SEAL mission (a SEAL team sea-story or experience) and ends with a suggested business take-away.  The lessons stimulated thought and offered ideas for improving individual and organizational leadership.  The authors left it to the readers to decide which lessons applied to their situations and then challenged them to apply those lessons.  The authors' candid perspectives and observations were refreshing and were reflected in their equally straightforward lessons.  A sampling of the authors' colorful lessons includes: *Avoid creating a capability and then looking for a mission to justify it *Build boundaries to prevent infighting and cannibalism *If you think no one else can replace you, you're an egotistical S.O.B. who's failed *There are probably good reasons why your marching orders seem screwed up *Identify your lead dogs, feed them well, and build a pack around them *If you need to scream, you need to practice  The team-building and teamwork concepts emphasized in this book apply to military and business leaders and organizations.  If you want time-tested ideas to improve your leadership, or your organization's effectiveness, then you should read this book.	2004-01-01
US	36825203	R2XJQ26U698GB1	0310208157	482773465	Everyone's a Coach: Five Business Secrets for High Performance Coaching	Books	5	2	2	N	N	A Coaching Legend's Leadership Lessons	Don Shula, the National Football League's all-time winningest coach, teamed up with Ken Blanchard, the internationally known and multiple award-winning author, educator, and management and leadership consultant, and together they co-wrote an outstanding book about leaders getting the best performance from the individuals and organizations they are privileged to lead.  Whether you are responsible for the performance of multiple organizations, or for just one other individual, the leadership wisdom and insights in this book can help you maximize your coaching and leadership effectiveness.  The winning combination of the two separately distinguished leaders in their respective fields, and the complementary structure of the book were brilliant.  Organized around the acronym C.O.A.C.H., the five coaching &#34;secrets&#34; that Shula had practiced and Blanchard has been teaching for over 30 years, the book alternated synergistic passages from Shula then Blanchard to explore and explain the acronym in theory and practice from the football gridiron to modern business situations, and ultimately to the game of life.  Here's how Shula and Blanchard define and think about the acronym C.O.A.C.H.: Conviction-Driven: Effective leaders stand for something. Overlearning: Effective leaders help their teams achieve practice perfection. Audible-Ready: Effective leaders, and the people and teams they coach, are ready to change their game plan when the situation demands it. Consistency: Effective leaders are predictable in their response to performance. Honesty-Based: Effective leaders have high integrity and are clear and straightforward in their interactions with others.  Conviction-Driven: &#34;Someone has said that a river without banks is a puddle.  When I apply that saying to human interactions, it reminds me of the job of a coach.  Like those river-banks, a good coach provides the direction and concentration for performers' energies, helping channel all their efforts toward a single desired outcome.  Without that critical influence, the best achievements of the most talented performers can lack the momentum and drive that make a group of individuals into champions.&#34;  Overlearning: &#34;To me a game doesn't end when the clock finally runs out.  It ends on Monday, after we've analyzed every play and learned all we can from it...Failure is successfully finding out what you don't want to repeat...Learning is defined as a change in behavior.  You haven't learned a thing until you can take action and use it.&#34;  Audible-Ready: &#34;Preparation means everything to me.  I'm passionate about my players being ready for anything.  Now, part of being ready is being able to shift your game plan at will.  I see myself as a battlefield commander who has the guts to make the right moves to win.  I want to be prepared with a plan - and then to expect the unexpected and be ready to change this plan.  I must preserve the right to change - even to change at the last moment - as circumstances demand...Audibles aren't surprises - just new ways of doing what you already know how to do.  Business people need to learn to call audibles, because in today's world, nothing stays the same.&#34;  Consistency: &#34;Your team will soon learn what your standards are and perform accordingly.  I not only insist on practice perfection, I'm there to see that it takes place.  I don't miss practices.  I need to be out there smelling out whatever isn't working.  Even the slightest deviation from perfection needs to be noticed and corrected on the spot.  Correcting and redirecting performance is strategically important - it's where we outstrip the competition.  Some coaches will let little things go.  Right there is where the difference is made.  To me, it's not a matter of how many times we've done it or how late it is or how tired the players are.  We'll do it until we get it right.  Then we won't deviate from it in the game.  I'd rather throw out a play or formation duringpractice than find out it can't be done correctly in the ball game.  We seldom try anything on game day that we haven't been able to perfect in practice.  If I'm asking our players to do something they can't do, I want to know about it now.&#34;  Honesty-Based: &#34;I have a straight-up approach.  I don't know how to go around corners or how to finesse.  My players know this and they expect candor from me.  Congruence is important to me.  What you see with Don Shula is what you get.  I don't play games.  Effective coaches confront their people, praise them sincerely, redirect or reprimand them without apology, and above all are honest with them.  Integrity pays, and integrity means being honest with yourself and others.  This is a key ingredient in my coaching philosophy.&#34;  In his introduction to the book, Blanchard stated that he is on a search for simple truths to help leaders and managers be their best.  With Shula's proven long-term coaching effectiveness as the foundation for this book, Blanchard has found and shared many  simple leadership truths and complexities.  This book would be a welcome addition to anyone's coaching or leadership collection.	2003-12-29

The only drawback to reading this book was that I was limited to five stars in reviewing it-it deserved much more.  Donald Phillips wrote one of the best leadership books I have ever read.  He skillfully blended many effective historical references (letters, speeches, vignettes, and anecdotes) with modern management and leadership theories to create an easy-to-read performance and character analysis of one of the very best leaders our country has ever known.  This remarkable book could (and should) serve as a &#34;wake-up call&#34; for the many self-proclaimed leaders in all walks of life who fail to understand the adage, &#34;Leadership is action, not position.&#34; Some of the book's timeless leadership themes demonstrated and often perfected by Lincoln included: *Leaders foster trust and build effective relationships with subordinates. *Leaders are persuasive vice coercive; coercive dictatorships violate the basic rights of individuals. *Leaders build leaders, not followers, though vision, patience, and persistence for long-term effectiveness vice short-term gains or conveniences. *A leader who constantly maintains his honesty and integrity, and shows compassion and mercy, will inspire all around him or her to loyalty and great achievements.  Phillips, in his preface, perfectly described the book's value to the leaders of today and tomorrow... &#34;Since leadership principles are usually expressed rather abstractly, there is a great need for simple, concrete illustrations.  Tangible examples make the difference; people relate to them.  That's what the study of Lincoln gives us - tangible examples from a widely recognized great leader.  Therein lies the basic premise of this book.  I hope that present and future leaders in all walks of life will be enlightened (as I was) by the remarkable leadership genius of Abraham Lincoln and then will use that knowledge to improve their own skills.&#34;	2003-12-17

For readers unfamiliar with Dorothy Law Nolte's 1954 classic poem, it is included in the front of the book along with Nolte's introduction, &#34;The Story of &#34;Children Learn What They Live,&#34;&#34; in which she shares her thought processes and experiences that led to her wonderful creation.<br /><br />If there were any doubts about the unbelievably powerful influence that parents have on their children, this book will erase any such doubts.  I found it a delightful and insightful, easy-to-read book filled with many realistic, common family situations that reflected my own beliefs, experiences, and personal parental goals and expectations.  The stories and examples were very effective in helping me to understand and visualize the authors' main points and insights.<br /><br />The most important theme throughout the book for me was that parents have conscious choices to make when it comes to responding to their children.  Often, those choices are between good, helpful, thoughtful, and objective proactive responses, and bad, hurtful, thoughtless, and emotional reactive responses.  Children are sponges to their parents' words, emotions, and behaviors.<br /><br />Just as the old adage says that leaders lead by example, parents parent by example.  As a father, reading this book reminded me of the closing to another of my all-time favorite poems, &#34;Little Eyes Upon You:&#34; &#34;You are setting an example/every day in all you do,/For the little boy who's waiting/to grow up to be like you.&#34;<br /><br />This great book should not be read just by parents for raising children, it should be read by everyone for building character and stronger relationships.	2003-11-17

Despite the author's impressive credentials and his obvious skill with discussing in clear and common-sense language a wide range of leadership-related topics, the presentation of his thoughts and insights was sloppy, confusing, and severely detracted from what could, and should, have been a much better and tighter leadership primer.  With no table of contents and no grouping of the seventy-seven topics into logical and coherent categories, each single topic was read and presented in complete isolation of the other topics.  The one-page topic descriptions and explanations were too brief to effectively stand-alone, and would have benefited greatly from the synergy provided from being grouped together with related topics.  I repeatedly thought to myself as I read the book, &#34;He said something very similar somewhere else,&#34; but the lack of organization quickly frustrated my efforts to use the book to cross-reference among the topics.  Ironically, the back cover accurately described from my perspective not what the book is in its present form, but rather what it could easily be if it was effectively organized: &#34;Stan Toler...creates a winning combination of motivational quotes, enlightening scripture, and eye-opening narratives that will inspire you to unlock the potential in your own life and still find time to have an impact upon those who look up to you...packed full of practical, hands-on advice that will spark your mind and get you on the fast track toward achieving your goals while encouraging those around you.&#34;	2003-07-22

The result was a truly outstanding book of leadership thoughts, concepts, principles, and analysis complemented by exemplary vignettes and anecdotes from the life of arguably the most respected and admired president in United States history.  Do not miss this book if you are a student or practitioner of leadership.  The book is a four part study of Reagan's leadership effectiveness: the critical elements of his vision-based leadership approach, his mutually supporting leadership and management styles, the skills that made him the &#34;Great Communicator,&#34; and the personal character that transformed his beliefs and vision into powerful realities.  At the end of each chapter is a list of summarizing leadership lessons and principles.  Strock's thorough research and insightful analysis made each list pregnant with meaning and importance.  Strock made a very strong case that Reagan's brilliance as a leader was his gift of a compelling, five-part vision (family, work, neighborhood, freedom, and peace) and the integrity of his consistent and disciplined actions relative to his vision.  Strock also discussed some Reagan leadership flaws and failures-not many, but enough to appear honest and balanced.  Strock's Reagan was an authentic man of vision, purpose, and character.  Read this book and you will understand how Reagan was willing and able to communicate great thoughts with authority as the leader of the free world, and why his vision for America was believed in by so many people here at home and around the world:  &#34;Ours is the land of the free because it is the home of the brave.  America's future will always be great because our nation will always be strong.  And our nation will be strong because our people will be free.  And our people will be free because we will be united, one people under God, with liberty and justice for all.&#34;	2003-07-21

His game plan for success was largely told through his gridiron experiences, but this plan is about much more than just football-it is a proven, common-sense guide for succeeding in the game of life.  What makes Holtz's life and leadership insights so compelling and believable are his dynamic life experiences and his incredible list of accomplishments: parents were divorced; fiance' broke off their engagement, but they later married and remain so after 40 years; only coach to lead 4 different programs to top-20 finishes and 6 different programs to bowl games (William and Mary, N.C. State, Arkansas, Minnesota, Notre Dame, South Carolina); 23 of 32 college teams he coached have received bowl bids, with 18 top-25 finishes, 8 top-10 finishes, and one undefeated national championship; 3rd winningest active coach and 7th place all-time with 243 victories; wife's heroic battle with throat cancer; fired or let go as assistant coach more than once; polled as the best motivational speaker in the country two years in a row, and his motivational video &#34;Do Right!&#34; is the all-time best-seller; guest speaker at most Fortune 500 companies; and was invited to the Oval Office by four different presidents.  Holtz's game plan consists of ten steps. Each step is explored in detail in its own chapter. The colorful, real-world stories and humorous anecdotes Holtz used to present the steps' lessons perfectly complemented his conversational writing style. The final chapter is considered the &#34;end-zone&#34; of success-where you can be if you have the courage, desire, and character to apply the lessons described within the plan's steps.  The book is jammed full of common-sense, spiritual, philosophical, and motivational life and leadership perspectives. The most memorable passages for me as a father, leader, and follower were Holtz's thoughts about discipline: &#34;For me, a disciplinarian is someone who requires that people understand the consequences of their decisions. You use discipline to reinforce choices. Our athletes and my children knew that if they chose to misbehave, they were also choosing to pay the consequences...In each case, I never punished anyone; the offenders chose the punishment themselves by their actions.&#34;  He illustrated his commitment to being a disciplinarian by describing the circumstances that led to him suspending his top three Arkansas players before the 1977 Orange Bowl (against Oklahoma), and to suspending two of his best players before his top-ranked Notre Dame team played the second-ranked University of Southern California in 1988: &#34;[They] recklessly violated our Do Right rule, which governs personal conduct...These were not bad guys; they simply made a bad decision...I didn't want the keys to our offense to miss our biggest game of the year, but when they decided to break our rules, they also decided to miss the game.  Now I had to support that choice.&#34;  Holtz is a master motivator and a proven true winner in football and life. My highest recommendation for this book is best captured by Holtz himself when he wrote, &#34;As you know, the only things that will change you from where you are today to where you want to be five years from now are the books you read and the people you meet.&#34; I hope I someday get a chance to meet Lou Holtz and thank him for his outstanding book on life and leadership.	2003-06-30

The authors did a great job explaining a lot of current &#34;best practices&#34; in use by recognized innovative businesses.  Then, they made a very strong case that future competitiveness in today's dynamic, globally connected world depends on a holistic commitment to institutionalizing &#34;best practices&#34; into business model (the &#34;who,&#34; &#34;what,&#34; &#34;when,&#34; &#34;why,&#34; &#34;where,&#34; &#34;how,&#34; and &#34;how much&#34; of providing products and services) innovation that continually meets and exceeds stakeholders' (customers, employees, partners, suppliers, distributors, shareholders, lenders, communities, etc.) needs and expectations while remaining true to a solid core of corporate values and principles.  As a &#34;business-novice&#34; I sometimes had trouble following and understanding some of the similar-sounding &#34;down-in-the-weeds&#34; business terms.  But, I really liked the authors' approach in giving readers many tools and options to innovate their business models based on their own situations.  The authors made clear that organizations can either innovate their business models every 2-4 years or they can stagnate, wither, and die.  The authors' most important revelation is that their common-sense approach to making continuous business model innovation a priority is not a common practice: only a few businesses have even begun to 'scratch-the-surface' of this achievable vision of the future of business.  I believe the best way to face the future is to help create it, and reading this book can be a great start to creating your competitively advantageous future.	2003-06-27

It was well-written and expertly balanced management and leadership concepts with real-world examples of effectively aligned organizations, such as Federal Express and Southwest Airlines.  This book should be read and discussed by leaders and managers at all levels, especially by mid- to senior-level executives.  In brief, alignment deals with the relationships among the people, processes, strategy, and customers of an organization relative to that organization's purpose, or what the authors called &#34;the main thing.&#34;  Alignment is both a noun, a state of being, and a verb, a set of actions.  Vertical alignment connects organizational strategy with the people responsible for transforming that strategy into meaningful work.  Horizontal alignment deals with understanding your customers' wants and then creating processes to deliver what your customers want, when and how they want it.  Effective leadership nurtures the organizational culture that is built around and upon &#34;the main thing,&#34; and it is this culture and leadership combination that drives and sustains self-aligning organizations in turbulent times.  The authors' analogy of landing a plane helped me to visualize the dynamics involved with organizational alignment.  To land a plane, a pilot must adjust and react to multiple simultaneous factors and conditions (i.e. air speed, altitude, angle of approach, wind speed and direction, etc.) and then understand how a change in one will affect the others.  Likewise, to align an organization, a leader must adjust and react to feedback about his people, processes, strategy, and customers, and then understand how a change in one will affect the others.  The authors clearly and thoroughly explained the alignment factors and conditions throughout the book.  They followed their explanations with incisive questions for readers to ask about themselves and their organizations to assess their degree of alignment.  Those questions were definitely a highlight of the book for they really helped to stimulate my thinking and should help inspire organizational progress to alignment.  Another highlight was the appendices that contained examples of actual tools and products used and created by some of the aligned organizations studied by the authors.  The inside back cover jacket sums up why I give the book my highest recommendation: &#34;Essential reading for all managers and executives, &#34;The Power of Alignment&#34; offers a new way to reestablish focus and sustained energy, and is a dynamic approach for staying balanced and achieving extraordinary levels of performance.&#34;	2003-05-27

I was pleasantly surprised to find this book was written as a complementary &#34;stand-alone&#34; book with a much different style than its predecessor.  Unlike Blanchard's usual simple, entertaining, and fun-to-read story-telling books, this book was a detailed, practical, common-sense guideline for individuals and organizations on their journeys from hierarchy to empowerment.  Besides the credible factual and objective analysis of becoming empowered, this book confirmed for me what I always suspected about Blanchard's usual powerful parables: they are backed up by extensive research, knowledge, and experience.  This book starts with a great, concise overview of &#34;Empowerment Takes More Than a Minute,&#34; and then moves on to common, expected questions with practical, executable answers designed to assist people and organizations going through the journey from hierarchy to empowerment.  The book concludes with an outstanding detailed empowerment action plan that captures the essence of how the 3 keys to empowerment (share information with everyone, create autonomy through boundaries, and let teams become the hierarchy) can and should be applied simultaneously through the 3 stages of change (starting and orienting the journey, change and discouragement, and adopting and refining empowerment).  Designed as a guidebook, I can easily see the book being used by leaders at all levels who must deal with and implement empowering, or other major changes in their organizations.  As is the case with all guidebooks, the information in this book requires the readers' judgment in applying it to the realities of their situations.  If viewed as a guaranteed checklist for success by people and organizations that want a quick fix with little thought, this book will likely fall short of expectations.  If viewed as a practical,common-sense packed reference, I believe this book will be an invaluable leadership tool for long-term effectiveness and efficiency.	2003-05-07

I found the book to be a great, honest accounting of a very prominent and controversial public figure involved in very sensitive and high-level government issues and policies-U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, U.S. hostage negotiations, international arms sales, and the &#34;Iran-Contra Affair&#34; to name a few.  I related to North as a lieutenant colonel of Marines in the highly structured, undisciplined, politicized, and bureaucratic environment of the highest levels of government in Washington, D.C. North came across as an imperfect man who admitted his mistakes and who did his best to do what he was told, do what he thought was right, and do what he thought was best for his country.  To say that North has had an interesting life is an understatement. North's background in this book definitely helped me to understand and appreciate his keen insights and perspectives while watching him report from the battlefields in our war with Iraq: *His &#34;Norman Rockwell&#34; small-town childhood-dad was a combat-decorated WWII Army officer *The near-fatal car accident while attending the U.S. Naval Academy that severely injured him but crippled one friend and killed another *His commissioning, marriage, and subsequent deployment to Vietnam *His infantry platoon leader combat leadership experiences *The challenges of balancing his Marine Corps and family duties and responsibilities *How his re-affirmed strength of faith sustained him in many life struggles (the book contains many powerful biblical and inspirational references) *How he was assigned to the National Security Council in 1981, and eventually fired on November 25, 1986 *His experiences testifying before Congress investigating the &#34;Iran-Contra Affair&#34; starting on July 7, 1987, ending with his indictment on 16 accounts on March 16, 1988 *His very public trial that started February 21, 1989, through the May 14 verdict of guilty on 3 counts (out of 16), and his July 5 sentencing (3 year suspended sentence, $150,000 fine, 2 years probation, and 1200 hours of community service in an inner-city drug-prevention program) *The special prosecutor's subsequent 3 failed appeals from July 20, 1990 to May 28, 1991, and finally, on September 15, 1991, the special prosecutor's dropping of all charges and the closing of the case against North *His calling-it-like-he-saw-it praise and criticism of democrats and republicans in all branches of the government, civil servants, and foreign diplomats and governments  The book showed the best and worst, and highs and lows of justice, politics, democracy, and bureaucracy in action, from the unique perspective of an outsider who became an insider, and then was simultaneously viewed as both villain and victim by those he worked for and with, and by the American public. Truly an American story that should not be missed.	2003-04-22

Most of all, he was a charismatic leader who inspired himself and others to great achievements in a time when America was starting to come of age as an emerging world power.  James Strock did a tremendous job in capturing the many leadership lessons that can be learned from the life and times of this extraordinary man.  The book's thirteen chapter titles do a good job of describing Roosevelt's leadership effectiveness: &#34;Leading-wherever you are,&#34; &#34;Always learning,&#34; &#34;Action, action, and still more action,&#34; &#34;Getting the best on your team,&#34; &#34;Putting action into words,&#34; and &#34;Putting words into action&#34; to name just a few.  At the end of each chapter is a listing of Roosevelt's leadership take-aways that can serve as an excellent primer on leadership.  For example, &#34;A leader should aim to build a life based on service, not a career based on advancing up a series of positions,&#34; &#34;Strive to exemplify character,&#34; &#34;Courage (physical and moral) can be developed as an act of will,&#34; and &#34;Use simple, down-to-earth stories to communicate complex issues.&#34;  Throughout the book, Strock made great use of many colorful Roosevelt quotes and anecdotes, what I affectionately call, &#34;Teddyisms,&#34; to reinforce his main points and help bring those points to life.  Besides extensive research into the life, writings, and others' personal recollections of Roosevelt, Strock made many effective references to respected current leadership and management experts such as Stephen Covey, Peter Drucker, John Maxwell, and Warren Bennis.  Those references proved to me that Roosevelt's leadership has stood the test of time and is certainly still applicable today.  This book helped reinforce my opinion of Roosevelt as a morally and physically courageous leader who was not afraid to follow his vision and convictions despite often open and powerful publicopposition.  After reading this book, I can understand why many people view Roosevelt as a benchmark against which to judge public servants, especially presidents.	2003-04-18

Bob Greene is a gifted writer who wrote a great book about a remarkable town that did extraordinary things in some of the most trying times in our nation's history.  The miracle of the North Platte Canteen is a story about little-known wartime heroics, filled with many first-hand personal accounts and recollections from some of our diminishing remaining national treasures-our WWII veterans.  This book should be read by all, especially those not old enough to have experienced WWII America.  This book describes and explains Greene's love affair with the North Platte, Nebraska railroad canteen and the people whose lives were positively influenced by what happened there between Christmas Day, 1941 and April 1, 1946.  The residents of that small town, and neighboring towns, took it upon themselves to provide food, love, and support to the millions of servicemen riding in the endless, cramped WWII troop transport trains that stopped briefly in North Platte.  Greene captured the volunteer canteen workers' incredible spirit of selfless sacrifice, and the everlasting gratitude of the mostly drafted young men who briefly stopped at North Platte on their way to war.  Although most stops lasted maybe ten minutes, their memories of their canteen experiences have lasted all their lives.  As Greene noted, &#34;He started to cry softly in mid-sentence.  I would have attributed it to the stress of being about to go into surgery, except that it was happening regularly when I spoke with the men who had come through North Platte on the trains.  The volunteers from the canteen, while emotional, usually remained composed.  But the soldiers they had welcomed...as often as not, they would weep at some point during our conversations as they recalled the experience.&#34;  The memory of any place that brings tears to the eyes of men who have seen and experienced combat is a very special memory of a very special place.  The story of the North Platte Canteen is a story of a long ago and largelyforgotten America when times were slower and people seemed more morally balanced and values-centered.  However, according to a January 31, 2003 &#34;Washington Times&#34; article, the staff at a North Platte motel revived the canteen tradition by providing a friendly dinner &#34;with a bit of hospitality for dessert&#34; for over 500 North Dakota National Guard troops who stopped there after a long day on the road on their way to the Persian Gulf in preparation for war with Iraq. Read this book and learn all about this very special tradition.	2003-04-09

I am convinced this book has the potential to lead organizations to unheard of levels of effectiveness and productivity.  In typical Ken Blanchard fashion, the authors taught their important lessons through a logical and believable fictional story based on their years of research and experience.  The story &#34;guides readers step-by-step through one manager's struggle to discover the three essential keys to empowerment.  By following the manager's odyssey to the Land of Empowerment, readers discover that they can take the same journey, which, like any heroic journey, is filled with paradox, challenge, and fitful stops and starts.&#34;  The authors defined empowerment as not giving power to people, but releasing the knowledge, experience, and motivation they already have.  They then identified and explained the three essential keys for achieving true empowerment:   1. Share information with everyone   2. Create autonomy through boundaries   3. Replace hierarchical thinking with self-managed teams  These simple definitions are deceptively powerful when teamed with patience and persistence.  I found the title of this book was most appropriate.  From my experience, the term `empowerment' is frequently spoken, largely misunderstood, and rarely applied to its maximum extent.  This book took the mystery out of the concept of empowerment and left me with a great appreciation for what true empowerment is and how it can be achieved.  I am excited about what it could release in me and others who read it.	2003-03-20

This &#34;manual&#34; was not the easiest book to read, but once I got comfortable with the dated and sometimes awkward language, I found the book tough to put down.  I believe the lessons contained in this book take moments to learn and understand, but require a lifetime to master.  I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone interested in seeing how the thoughts of one of mankind's greatest philosophers apply to life today.  &#34;Enchiridion&#34; is organized into 52 descriptive paragraphs (chapters) that are considered the highlights of Epictetus' documented philosophical teachings.  Each paragraph presented common life situations and describes how one should think and act about them.  The opening lesson introduced the practice of recognizing those things in life that are and are not in our power.  Those things in our power, described as, &#34;such great things... through which alone happiness and freedom are secured,...&#34; are our own acts, like opinion, desire, moving towards and turning from a thing.  Those things not in our power, described as being slavish, subject to restraint, and in the power of others, are our bodies, property, reputation, and jobs or careers.  This lesson concluded with focusing on those things within our power, and not being concerned about what is not in our power.  The other great comforting lesson for me was, &#34;Remember that thou art an actor in a play of such a kind as the teacher (author) may choose; if short, of a short one; if long, of a long one: if he wishes you to act the part of a poor man, see that you act the part naturally; if the part of a lame man, of a magistrate, of a private person, (do the same).  For this is your duty, to act well the part that is given to you; but to select the part, belongs to another.&#34;  The pages of this thin book are pregnant with meaning,insights, and wisdom, and I believe it is a very positive influence in my life.	2003-01-30

I distinctly remember being immediately inspired by the leadership demonstrated by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.  I bought this book hoping to learn more about this heroic leader and gain some insights into how he prepared for and responded to the unprecedented and unimaginable horrors and challenges in the moments, days, and months following the attacks that claimed thousands of innocent lives.  I was not disappointed.  I am convinced that no one can write &#34;the definitive&#34; book about the dynamic topic of leadership.  The value of Giuliani's book was that he shared his personal leadership principles and then shared personal and often colorful stories of how he learned and applied those principles. What I found most refreshing and of most value to me and I believe to those interested in developing as leaders was that he acknowledged and repeatedly emphasized how his experiences contributed to the leadership he demonstrated in response to September 11.  Many people say that leaders are made, not born.  Giuliani went a step further and humbly gave credit to his mentors and experiences in a way that made me reflect on why I am the type of leader I am today and want to be tomorrow.  Giuliani is the only person who could have written this once-in-a-lifetime book (at least I fervently pray that nobody else has a chance to write about his or her experiences as the mayor of a major metropolitan city leading up to and following a massive terrorist attack).  I highly recommend this book, and believe the back cover comments complement my recommendation: &#34;For having more faith in us than we had in ourselves, for being brave when required and rude where appropriate and tender without being trite, for not sleeping and not quitting and not shrinking from the pain all around him, Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of the World, is &#34;Time&#34; 2001 Person of the Year.&#34;	2003-01-17

With his childhood stories, he took me on a journey through time to a place that many today would dismiss as &#34;old-fashioned,&#34; and Hickam would argue was &#34;the way things can and should be.&#34;  Inspired by the events of September 11, 2001, Hickam reflected on his youth and realized the values he grew up with in Coalwood were what many people needed to move on with their lives following the tragic terrorist attacks on America.  Hickam expertly wove his thoughts and experiences into the four &#34;Coalwood Attitudes of Strength and Courage&#34; (We are proud of who we are, We stand up for what we believe, We keep our families together, and We trust in God but rely on ourselves), which led to the &#34;Coalwood Assumption&#34; that most Americans found themselves either wanting to say or saying repeatedly following 9/11: &#34;We are not afraid.&#34;  In his introduction, Hickam explains the purpose of this book: &#34;If you want to stop being afraid, or if you want to avoid the habits of fear and dread, this book can help by teaching you a philosophy of life that will fill your heart and soul with a sense of well-being and confidence.  It is a philosophy that was developed by real people who led good, happy and hearty lives while managing to raise a crop of children who went on to have successful lives of their own.&#34;  Hickam is a master storyteller, and his stories contained many powerful moral and inspirational passages.  Some I related to as personal memories, others as things I missed growing up or never thought about, and still others as a father wanting his young son to experience in his childhood.  This book has a lot to offer to many different people with many different needs in many different situations.  I encourage everyone to read this book and let Hickam take you on a journey of discovery into your heart and soul.	2002-11-22

It deserves at least twice that many for honestly and publicly discussing the challenges and opportunities that today's U.S. military faces as it struggles to accept and adapt to the revolutionary and transforming environment in which it finds itself.  Today's U.S. military faces a post-Soviet Union superpower-rival environment with an asymmetric global terrorism threat, in a rapidly exploding advanced technological computer-networked world, and an administration that respects it and understands today's forces cannot continue to function on yesterday's paradigms and be successful against tomorrow's foes.  The authors clearly described these dynamic circumstances, boldly challenged today's defense status quo, and bravely offered compelling alternatives intended to further the revolution in military affairs (a Clinton-era term) or the transformation of the armed forces (today's current term).  I read this book after being stationed in the Pentagon for the last two-plus years.  I believe it has influenced many of the highest-level transformational studies and initiatives that I have heard about and in which I have participated.  I do not necessarily believe everything the authors describe and recommend, but I do believe their insights and vision of what our future forces might be and what they might be able to do are certainly deserving of serious discussion and consideration.  If I were the Secretary of Defense for a day, I would make reading this book a requirement for all my staff and a pre-requisite for any assignment or appointment to the Pentagon.	2002-11-12
US	36825203	RZ7FZVKD2IMG5	0070120641	687795084	The Disney Way	Books	5	28	28	N	N	How Disney Does It	If you have ever wondered how Disney does it year-in and year-out, and why other companies are constantly competing with and comparing themselves to Disney, then you need to read this book and learn about Disney's magic.  The authors are a couple of Fortune 100 consultants who studied and now teach the management and leadership `secrets' that have kept the Disney name synonymous with organizational excellence for decades.  The opening paragraph inside the front cover flap was all I needed to inspire me to read this book: &#34;Walt Disney's dreams, beliefs, and daring gave birth to captivating characters, thrilling theme park attractions, and breathtaking tales that have inspired the imaginations of generations of children and adults.  Disney also launched an entertainment and marketing empire whose influence is felt around the world, and whose success provides a model of business excellence that can guide any company.&#34;  The authors did a great job introducing and explaining Walt Disney's four pillars - Dream, Believe, Dare, Do.  The authors then skillfully showed how upon those pillars were built the ten Disney principles of: 1- Give every member of your organization a chance to dream, and tap into the creativity those dreams embody. 2- Stand firm on your beliefs and principles. 3- Treat your customers like guests. 4- Support, empower, and reward employees. 5- Build long-term relationships with key suppliers and partners. 6- Dare to take calculated risks in order to bring innovative ideas to fruition. 7- Train extensively and constantly reinforce the company's culture. 8- Align long-term vision with short-term execution. 9- Use the storyboarding technique to solve planning and communication problems. 10- Pay close attention to detail.  The opening chapter gave the necessary background on Walt Disney's formative years. The next ten chapters each focused on a different principle.  Each chapter used stories and case studies about big and small organizations that successfully applied that particular Disney principle.  All chapters ended with reflective questions to ask and actions to take for yourself and your organization that reinforced that chapter's focus.  The questions and actions were all clear and concise, and, probably more often than not, unpleasant for individuals and leadership to honestly answer and admit to.  I know that the Disney way is easy to understand, much more difficult to execute, much less frequently executed than it can and should be, and truly unforgettable when experienced firsthand.  This book can be your most important first step on the journey into Disney magic for you and your organization if you have the courage to dream, believe, dare, and do - The Disney Way.	2002-11-11

First, it helped me understand and appreciate how Disney continues to deliver the highest quality products and services year-in and year-out.  Secondly, it clearly described many proven ways and concepts to improve my organization's customer service.  Lastly, this book gave me a lot of practical lessons that can and should be adapted to fit into most management or leadership situations.  I read a couple of outstanding books by Disney-outsiders (&#34;Built to Last&#34; by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, and &#34;The Disney Way&#34; by Bill Capodagli and Lynn Jackson) about how and why they were so impressed with Disney.  I wanted to read a book about a Disney-insider's perspectives on what Disney does to impress everyone and exceed all expectations.  This book showed me the &#34;what&#34; of Disney's practical magic of customer service: a full-time business of shared values, enforced standards, focused work, self-discipline, and attention to detail that is virtually transparent to all Disney guests.  I got all that I wanted and more from this outstanding book.  After I finished reading this book, I read through my highlights and realized that the following paragraph from the introduction perfectly previewed the book:  &#34;In this book, we take you behind the scenes to discover Disney best practices and philosophies in action.  We provide you with an insider's glimpse of quality service principles in action both at Walt Disney World, as told from the perspectives of cast members [Disney-speak for &#34;employees&#34;], and in other organizations, as told by executives who have participated in Disney Institute programs.  Walt Disney's fundamentals for success still ring true.  You build the best product you can.  You give people effective training to support the delivery of exceptional service.  You learn from your experiences.  And you celebrate success.  You never stop growing.  You never stop believing.&#34;  Sharing the secrets behind Disney's `practical magic' in this book is yet another example of Disney's commitment to exceptional guest [Disney-speak for &#34;customer&#34;] service.  Read this book and enjoy being Disney's guest.	2002-10-15

Lee on Leadership : Executive Lessons in Character, Courage, and Vision	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Timeless Reflections of a Great Man and Leader	If you are looking for a Robert E. Lee biography, or a detailed historical account of Lee's civil war experiences, this book is not for you.  The subtitle to this book, &#34;Executive lessons in character, courage, and vision,&#34; is precisely why I recommend it to anyone interested in developing as a person of character and as an effective leader.  As a fan of military history, Crocker's use of Lee's civil war experiences as the primary setting for this masterful analysis of Lee's leadership was as informative as it was entertaining.  Crocker also used Lee's pre- and post-war experiences to present a complete picture of Lee the man as well as Lee the soldier.  Ten of the book's eleven chapters ended with concise, bulletized leadership lessons that highlighted the chapter's key points.  Lee's leadership was not always perfect, and the chapters' lessons allowed me to learn from and understand Lee's failures and successes.  Crocker's expert use of quotes complemented his descriptive narratives and in-depth analysis to create an easy-to-read character and leadership primer.  Consider the following examples...  * In a letter to his son: &#34;Live in the world you inhabit.  Look upon things as they are.  Take them as you find them.  Make the best of them.  Turn them to your advantage.&#34;  * General Grant's recollection of Lee's April 9, 1865 surrender at Appomattox: &#34;[Lee] was a man of much dignity, with an impassable face... my own feelings, which had been quite jubilant on the receipt of his letter [agreeing to discuss terms for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia], were sad and depressed.  I felt like anything rather than rejoicing at the downfall of a foe who had fought so long and valiantly, and had suffered so much for a cause, though that cause was, I believe, one of the worst for which a people ever fought.&#34;  * &#34;...obedience to lawful authority is the foundation of manly character...As a general principle you should not `force' young mento do their duty, but let them do it voluntarily and therefore develop their characters...Young men must not expect to escape contact with evil, but must learn not to be contaminated by it.  That virtue is worth but little that requires constant watching and removal from temptation.&#34;  Robert E. Lee was devoutly loved by the men he was privileged to lead, deeply respected by the commanders who opposed him, and always recognized as a true gentleman by all who knew him.  Read this book and you will learn why Robert E. Lee remains one of the most revered American leaders in history.	2002-09-26

Books	5	58	59	N	N	A Great Thought-Provoking Book	I do not normally choose to read a book based on the author's resume', but Stockdale's credentials (retired thirty-three year U.S. Navy Vice Admiral (3-stars), spent over seven years as the highest ranking U.S. prisoner of war (POW) in Vietnam, Medal of Honor recipient, 1992 Reform Party vice presidential candidate, president of the Naval War College and the Citadel, holder of eleven honorary doctoral degrees, experimental test pilot, author, professor), compelled me to read his book.  I am very glad I followed my gut instincts, for Stockdale wrote one of the best thought-provoking books about life, character, and leadership that I have ever read.  This book is a collection of essays, speeches, and articles by Stockdale (and one by a Stockdale friend and colleague) about his many and diverse experiences and how they have influenced his personal philosophies about life, character, and leadership.  Many of his key points are repeated throughout the book, but the different purposes and audiences for the essays, speeches, and articles prevented those key points from becoming stale.  Stockdale's key points included, but were not limited to: character is demonstrated under pressure; his POW experience was the defining event in his life, a blessing (that I believe most non-POWs (like myself) will have trouble understanding or appreciating); the value of an education in philosophic classics (i.e. Stoicism, Epictetus, the Enchiridion, etc.); his first-hand accounts of the events leading up to the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution which officially began our involvement in the Vietnam War (I was surprised); how the lack of character and integrity in senior U.S. leadership prolonged the Vietnam War and ultimately led to defeat and betrayal; and how Vietnam's U.S. POWs differed from our POWs in other wars.  Not one of the easiest books to read, but certainly one of my most inspiring and stimulating readings.  I believe this book is one that I will use as a frequent reference, and it is already influencing my personal research and reading selections.	2002-09-25

I am amazed at his ability to capture my life's common and often taken-for-granted moments and teach me how to see what I too often fail to see.  I related to this book as a first-time dad with a toddler son.  Taking and making time to be there for my wife and son in the &#34;precious present&#34; is something I truly treasure.  In my efforts to be a better husband and father, this book renewed and reinforced my commitments to them.  Lou Holtz, the dynamic and successful college football coach and motivational speaker, wrote, &#34;I am not what I want to be, I am not what I ought to be, I am not what I am going to be, but thank God, I am not what I used to be.&#34;  That quote sums up how I feel about my ability to constantly live in the precious present.  Johnson's book will now be a frequent `reality check' for me and I recommend it to anyone who might need a quick reminder of what makes the present so precious.	2002-08-31

Vince Lombardi has written one of the very best leadership books I have ever read.  It is thorough, well-researched, and full of great quotes, stories, and personal anecdotes about coaching and leadership.  This book was the result of Lombardi's many years of personal observations and experiences with both positive and negative coaches and leaders in law, politics, football, writing, and speaking.  Lombardi's writing style suggests that he wrote this book to pass on what he has learned, and not merely to try and impress the reader with his superior language and clever catch-phrases.  The book is neatly organized into four chapters: coaching for teamwork, the winning coach, the winning team, and constant reinforcement.  Lombardi closes the book with a reflective conclusion and a modest suggested reading list.  Most interesting to me was Lombardi's description of coaches: &#34;Coaches...know they belong on the sidelines.  Coaches know they can't play the game, know that only the players belong on the field of play, and that only players can actually win the game.  Coaches don't do things, they see that things get done - things that ensure the players are totally prepared mentally and physically.  Coaches seek to create an environment within which their players have the greatest opportunity to succeed.  A coach knows she is only as good as her players, so her first priority is not to seek to personally duplicate the talents of her players, but rather to provide for them the things they can't provide for themselves - direction, authority and the freedom to do their jobs.&#34;  To further solidify the coaching-leading connection, Lombardi states, &#34;The leader of the future is the coach.  Listening, communicating, teaching, challenging, directing, delegating, motivating players on the field - while she remains on the sidelines.&#34;  Lombardi simply wrote an extraordinary book for ordinary people who wish to learn about coaching and leadership, or for any leader who wants to refine his or her coaching and leadership skills to be effective in any teamwork environment.  If you thought coaching was only for organized and competitive sports, this book will show you that it really applies to the game of life.	2002-08-27

George Bernard Shaw once observed, 'Common sense is instinct. Enough of it is genius.' My instincts tell me this book was much closer to being genius than it was to just being overly simple common sense.  Johnson's clever and insightful story is about two mice ('Sniff,' who sniffs out change early, and 'Scurry,' who quickly scurries into action) and two 'little people' ('Hem,' who denies and resists change for fear of something worse, and 'Haw,' who adapts over time when he realizes change can lead to something better) who live in a maze and how they deal with the realities of unexpected changes in the location and quantity of their cheese supply. Each character represents an easy to recognize, common, stereotypical person with a common approach to changes in life. The cheese represents what a person wants in life (e.g. health, money, a good job, a strong relationship, peace of mind, etc.).  This book was an original and light-hearted approach to the complex and anxiety-filled subject of changes in life. Subtle yet powerful messages were expertly woven into the story and led me to pause, reflect on, and identify with the characters and their actions.  Johnson's style is not for everyone. If you have read any of his previous books, you will not want to miss this one. If you have never read any of Johnson's books, you may as well start with this one -- it may help change your life.	2002-08-26
US	36825203	RPW6NG63G5C1G	0060928077	713341293	Integrity	Books	4	26	28	N	N	Great beginning discussion	If you have ever thought about integrity (who has not?) and are looking for a comprehensive study or analysis on what this often-used and often-misunderstood character trait means traditionally and in today's society, then this book is a great place to start.  Carter defines integrity with three required steps.  Step 1 is the act of discerning what is right and what is wrong; your personal views are well thought out in advance.  Step 2 is acting on what you have discerned, even at personal cost.  He cautions that doing what is right will often be painful.  Step 3 is saying openly that you are acting on your understanding of right from wrong.  Carter repeatedly makes the point that the test of integrity comes only when doing the right entails a significant cost.  Carter analyzes actual and hypothetical examples using his three-step definition.  His examples include journalists, marriage vows, political candidates, competitive sportsmanship, and college professors' letters of reference, and more.  Carter's scholarly and lawyerly-logic efforts were certainly not light-reading, but he did well in making a potentially dry subject interesting and informative.  While his frequent and almost excessive direct references to his Catholic beliefs and his admiration of the American Civil Rights movement led by Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. might make some readers uncomfortable, I thought they were effective and appropriate to his discussions.  Towards the end of the book, Carter even proposes a set of eight principles for bringing true integrity to our politics and democracy that will certainly generate both positive and negative critiques.  Overall, I admire Carter's courage in tackling such a difficult subject (everybody thinks they know what it is, but very few seem to agree on it) and being the first to put it out front for all to see.  An introspective and thought-provoking book that was well worth the effort it took to read and absorb.	2002-08-15

The other half is John Wooden's twenty-one secrets, or teachings, for a lifetime of success. I highly recommend this unique and inspiring book to leaders and followers, teachers and scholars, coaches and players, fathers and sons, and husbands and wives.  After I read &#34;Wooden&#34; by John Wooden and Steve Jamison, I bought and read this book. I was initially disappointed with Hill's less-than-stellar, yet brutally honest, portrayal of a man for whom I have the deepest respect. I even thought about throwing the book away in disgust. I am glad I decided to keep it and read it all the way. I would have missed out on a truly fascinating and entertaining opportunity to learn many things that are helping me be a better person. I believe the same opportunity exists for anyone who reads this book.	2002-08-09

In 480 B.C., the Persian King Xerxes, with a force numbering upwards of two million men, met the Spartan King Leonidas, with a force of only three hundred Spartans and some allies, at the pass at Thermopylae.  When Xerxes demanded that the Spartans lay down their arms to allow the Persians to advance, Leonidas responded, &#34;Molon labe&#34; - come and get them.  What followed was probably the seven most heroic days in military history as the Spartans fought off the Persians and held the pass until the last man was finally overwhelmed and killed.  This outstanding book graphically tells the full story of this epic battle from the point-of-view of a gravely wounded Spartan battle squire captured by the Persians.  If you are a war, history, or military `buff,' or if you just love reading exciting and heroic stories, then you owe it to yourself to read this book.  Pressfield's research and writing style brought the battle to life in my mind like no other book since Michael Shaara's Civil War classic, &#34;The Killer Angels.&#34;  There is a famous ancient monument at Thermopylae that is inscribed with the words of the poet Simonides, that reads:  &#34;Go tell the Spartans, stranger passing by, that here obedient to their laws we lie.&#34;  Those few words have taken on a new meaning to me.  Read this book and you will understand why.	2002-08-09

If you like a step-by-step scientific approach, you will probably not relate well to this book.  If you are new to reading about leadership, this book will help give you a solid foundation from which to learn and grow as a leader.  If you are a seasoned leader, this book can offer you some fresh perspectives and new ways to look at yourself and those you lead.  Each chapter explains one of Maxwell's 21 leadership laws.  His explanations are complemented by vignettes of some familiar leadership failures and successes and personal anecdotes from his 30+ years of leadership experiences.  His writing style is easy to read, but I sometimes lost track of which law was being explained.  What I liked best about this book was that it was descriptive not prescriptive.  His descriptions and examples for each law left me time to reflect on how well or poorly those laws were followed by leaders I observed or by myself when I led others.  This book would make a welcome addition to anyone's leadership library.	2002-08-07

This book is a well researched analysis of the American (western) approach to and conduct of war, and its moral, physical, and political consequences. Accurate and powerful historical examples complement this analysis. Poole argues that despite all the claims of American military superiority at all levels, the U.S. military has grown so dependent on technology and massive ammunition expenditures that it has let its individual and small-unit skills and experiences atrophy and be lost.  If you believe that the U.S. military is by far the best in the world, then Poole's perspectives will challenge your beliefs. Read what he has to say about our World War II adversaries, think about what he says happened to us in Korea, follow his logic about what happened in Vietnam, remember our approach to and conduct of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, reflect on his discussion about our efforts in Somalia in 1993, and then see if you notice any common trends extending into our operations in Afghanistan. Scary stuff.  Fortunately, Poole also gives some common-sense advice to reverse the dangerous course we are following to tactical inferiority. This advice is exactly what many senior defense and defense-related leaders fear the most, for it would shatter the status quo in which they rose to power and have fought so hard to maintain.  Poole packs a big and important message into a small book that is as thought-provoking to the American taxpayers as it is to the American fighting men and women.	2002-08-04

Shackleton's amazing adventure saga alone is a great read, but it is the leadership insights that make this book a &#34;must-read.&#34;  Perkins carefully organized the book into four inter-related parts.  After briefly summarizing the Shackleton expedition, in Part One Perkins presents his 10 strategies for leading at the edge: 1- Vision and Quick Victories: Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on short-term objectives. 2- Symbolism and Personal Example: Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and behaviors. 3- Optimism and Reality: Instill optimism and self-confidence, but stay grounded in reality. 4- Stamina: Take care of yourself: Maintain your stamina and let go of guilt. 5- The Team Message: Reinforce the team message constantly: &#34;We are one - we live or die together.&#34; 6- Core Team Values: Minimize status differences and insist on courtesy and mutual respect. 7- Conflict: Master conflict - deal with anger in small doses, engage dissidents, and avoid needless power struggles. 8- Lighten Up!: Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about. 9- Risk: Be willing to take the Big Risk. 10- Tenacious Creativity: Never give up - there's always another move.  Interwoven with these strategies are detailed accounts from Shackleton's expedition and real world business examples to fully illustrate the strategies' applicability to today's leadership environments.  Part Two is case studies of four organizations that successfully applied the strategies and achieved remarkable success.  In Part Three, Perkins &#34;outlines a number of qualities and actions that...contribute to living, learning, and thriving at &#34;The Edge.&#34;&#34;  Part Four provides the reader with some tools to further develop individual leadership skills.  Written by a former combat Lieutenantof Marines in Vietnam and current &#34;President of The Syncretics Group, a consultancy that focuses on effective leadership in demanding environments,&#34; this book was a very enjoyable and informative study of leadership.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about, and seeing if they have what it takes for, leading at the edge.	2002-07-24

Secondly, I always admired and looked up to Tom Landry as a leader and a devoted Christian gentleman. Lastly, I love to collect and use quotes. I loved reading this book for one simple reason - it exceeded all expectations for all my reasons for buying it.  I cried the day Tom Landry died, and again the day after his death when I read articles and listened to television stories about the life and times of Tom Landry. This simple, little book brought back many of those same emotions. This book is not one author's lofty opinions about a man. It is a collection of quotes, stories, and vignettes from scores of people from all walks of life who are united in their deep love and respect for a man among men, a man of unquestioned character and integrity.  You do not have to be a Dallas Cowboys fan, nor know a thing about Tom Landry, nor do you need to collect quotes to enjoy and be motivated by this book. If you are inspired by reading true accounts of moral, spiritual, and successful leaders, then this book will exceed all your expectations, too.	2002-07-19

I just read this book for the second time (about 15 years after my first reading) and it re-confirmed my belief that this book is one of the best books I ever read.<br /><br />As a career Officer of Marines, I grew up seeing this book on the U.S. Marine Corps Reading List - and now I completely understand why.  Besides being an entertaining science fiction story, it is one of the best depictions of military life from an infantryman's perspective.  Heinlein realistically captured the mood, fears, thoughts, language, and challenges of the average &#34;Grunt&#34; in a timeless and universal way.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the societal philosophical aspect of the book.  Written in 1959 during the Cold War, Heinlein's moral and political implications, carefully woven into the story throughout the book, are still thought-provoking, and some are probably still  controversial even today.<br /><br />Another interesting and very subtle yet powerful message from this book is that despite technological advances (e.g. the interactive individual armor suits, and ultra-sonic,  powerful space transport ships), combat is still very personal and comes right down to the individual man on the ground engaging the enemy.  Today's technology-blinded military transformers would be wise to reflect on Heinlein's view of the human element in war:<br /><br />&#34;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-hour,  occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die.  We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.  We've been doing it, with changes in weapons but very little change in our trade, at least since the time five thousand years ago when the foot sloggers of Sargon the great forced the Sumerians to cry &#34;Uncle!&#34;&#34;	2002-07-18

Greenleaf.  Armed with varied and extensive civilian leadership experience, Greenleaf boldly took me on &#34;a journey into the nature of legitimate power and greatness.&#34;  This journey challenged me early on when Greenleaf stated that the traditional hierarchical leadership used in most organizations, one person in charge as the lone chief atop a pyramidal structure, is the likely cause of most of our leadership problems.  Greenleaf favored another, less frequently used tradition where the principle leader is &#34;primus inter pares&#34; - first among equals.  Throughout the book, Greenleaf made a compelling case that &#34;primus inter pares&#34; exists in important places with conspicuous success.  With my leadership experience rooted in the traditional military hierarchical structure, at times it was difficult to understand Greenleaf's perspectives on the first or second read.  Greenleaf's insights into the servant as leader (one who makes sure that other people's highest priority needs are being served) in the first chapter lays the foundation for his subsequent chapters: the institution as servant, trustees as servants, servant leadership in business, servant leadership in education, servant leadership in foundations, servant leadership in churches, servant leaders, servant responsibility in a bureaucratic society, and America and world leadership.  With all the recent attention focused on moral and ethical breakdowns within some large and powerful institutions (Enron, WorldCom, Arthur Anderson, the Catholic Church, etc.), this book's continued relevance is obvious.  Overcoming my challenges in reading this book was definitely worth the effort.	2002-07-17

Much is written about leaders, and this book helps to fill the huge gap in what is written for and about followers. The few minutes it takes to read this book could change the rest of your life. I first read it back in 1985 and I re-read it frequently.  Hubbard's inspiration for his &#34;preachment&#34; was an obscure but important event in the 1898 Spanish-American War. President McKinley needed someone to quickly deliver a message to an insurgent general somewhere in the jungles of Cuba. An army officer was recommended and McKinley personally handed the message to this officer with the mission to deliver the &#34;message to Garcia.&#34; This officer's unhesitating acceptance of his mission with no superfluous questions and his subsequent completion of the mission is Hubbard's definition of an invaluable subordinate.  Hubbard's lessons of initiative (doing the right thing without being told) and loyalty to yourself, your boss, and your organization (doing the right thing when told only once) are timeless and well told. Hubbard spoke to all leaders and subordinates when he wrote, &#34;It is not book-learning young men need, nor instruction about this and that, but a stiffening of the vertebrae which will cause them to be loyal to a trust, to act promptly, concentrate their energies: do the thing -- &#34;Carry a message to Garcia.&#34;&#34;	2002-04-18

Forester wrote one of the best books about the individual fighting man in war. His great storytelling style is entertaining and his admiration of the enlisted foot soldier is refreshing. This book is not only one of my personal favorites, it is also on the U.S. Marine Corps Reading List. A must-read for anyone who served, is serving, or will serve in the military, and highly recommended for anyone who likes a great, historically accurate adventure story.  In today's super-sophisticated and computer-intensive world, this book appears to be an out-of-place dinosaur. The beauty of this book is that it reminds the readers of the simple fact that while high-technology can be a force-multiplier on the battlefield, it does no good unless the troops are properly trained and know how and when to take the initiative and especially when they may find themselves cut off from their units, surrounded by enemy forces, and stripped of all but their basic weapons and individual survival skills. Rifleman Dodd shows how one effective and dedicated man can make a big difference despite the odds against him.  This book is one of the few books I like to read over and over again. Forester's genius becomes clear when you can make easy connections between Dodd's experiences and the actions of our troops on the ground in Afghanistan.	2002-04-15

I read the majority of this uplifting book as a metro train commuter to and from my duty station, the Pentagon.  Having known three of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon, I had personal reasons to read this book.  I found the many short, direct, and moving stories from common people, and their sharing of their deepest emotions, very comforting.  I consider this book to be another step in my continuing personal program of coping and healing.  I believe many others would also find reading it a great spiritual and emotional experience.  The only flaw with this outstanding book is that it is almost exclusively devoted to or focused on the World Trade Center heroes, victims, survivors, and volunteers.  The book has very few stories about what happened at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania.  I commend the authors for their tremendous job in compiling these great stories from the thousands received and for publishing such an important book in such a short time to help so many.  Tragedy and devastation were equally shared by friends, family, and acquaintances in New York, the Pentagon, and Pennsylvania.  I believe this book should have included a few more Pentagon and Pennsylvania specific stories since the book's cover proclaims, &#34;Stories to Heal the Heart of Our Nation.&#34;	2002-04-12

This book of Wooden's wisdom and life philosophies is definitely on my short list of the best books of all time about character and leadership.  This book is a collection of the simple and direct beliefs and observations of John Wooden, arguably the best (college) basketball coach of all time.  Interestingly, very little of what Wooden wants to teach is about basketball.  His quick stories, short vignettes, and detailed memories focus on life and relationships with others.  Coach Wooden is a gentle man with the courage and discipline to live his life according to his deepest held ideals, values, and principles.  Despite his teams' unbelievable success (10 NCAA national basketball championships in 12 years (including 7 in a row!), 88 consecutive victories, and 38 straight NCAA tournament victories), and his own fame (many coach-of-the-year honors, &#34;Sports Illustrated's&#34; sportsman of the year, a lifetime winning percentage of over 80%, and the first man to be elected to college basketball's hall of fame as both a player (3-time All-American at Purdue) and coach), he resisted the public pressures and temptations to stay true to himself and his beliefs.  Coach Wooden defines success as the &#34;peace of mind that is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.&#34;  The book finishes with 30 pages devoted to Wooden's legendary &#34;Pyramid of Success&#34; and another 5 pages of his favorite sayings - 35 priceless pages in a priceless book.  At a time when America is re-defining and searching for true heroes to lead us forward from our darkest days, this book is a beacon of hope and guidance and should serve as a blueprint for making heroes of us all.	2002-04-10

I especially recommend it to anyone who is interested in wars and the men who fight them.  Bradley's personal and passionate account of arguably the toughest, bloodiest, and most highly decorated battle our nation ever fought is simply remarkable.  By the end of the book you will long remember and appreciate the sacrifice and significance of the U.S. Marines' WWII Battle of Iwo Jima and the lives and deaths of the six flag raisers (Harlon Block, John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousley, and Mike Strank) forever immortalized in Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal's prize-winning photo atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, and in the world's largest bronze statue, the United States Marine Corps War Memorial.  Shortly after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, an e-mail I will never forget arrived at my work computer.  Attached to the e-mail was an image, actually two images side-by-side.  No words were needed.  On one side was the Rosenthal Iwo Jima flag-raising picture, and next to it was the New York City firemen flag-raising at &#34;Ground Zero&#34; picture.  Reading this book helped me to fully understand the old adage, &#34;A picture is worth a thousand words.&#34;	2002-04-10

Vince Lombardi is arguably the greatest professional football coach of all time.  His 10 year coaching record was 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties.  His legendary Green Bay Packers played in 6 World Championship games and won 5, including the first two Super Bowls, and his post-season record of 9 wins and 1 loss is unmatched.  Today, the name &#34;Lombardi&#34; conjures up many images in the minds of those who knew the man, knew of the man, or have heard the many myths and legends about the man.  Who better to tell and analyze Vince Lombardi's story than his son, Vince Jr.?  This book not only presents a balanced view of Vince Lombardi the man and coach, it also gives readers the &#34;Lombardi Leadership Model&#34; (self-knowledge + character + integrity = leadership) and other useful tools and insights for introspection and personal leadership development.  Besides being a great biographical account of a very complex, often misunderstood, and highly successful leader in a public and highly competitive environment, this book is also a great guide to personal growth for any leader in today's chaotic environment and tomorrow's uncertain future.	2002-04-10

Simply one of the best (if not THE best), most enjoyable, and most entertaining books on ethics, morality, character, and leadership.  This short and easy to read masterpiece by two of the most influential business and spiritual thinkers of our time should be required reading for all managers and leaders in any organization - business, family, government, military, etc.  The stories and situations used to teach the many commonsense (but unfortunately not common practice) lessons are real and recognizable to everyone.  The power and wisdom behind the three &#34;Ethics Check&#34; questions and the &#34;Five P's of Ethical Power&#34; for individuals and organizations are priceless.  If you ever wondered why some people and organizations make such a big deal about ethics, read this book and you will wonder why more people and organizations do not make ethics their top priority.	2002-04-09

Studying the western way of war is only half of the equation. Reading and absorbing the lessons in this book is the other half - the most important half.  This well-written and well-researched book is sorely needed in today's U.S. military. To all those blinded by the technologies involved in transforming the U.S. military, or the so-called &#34;revolution in military affairs,&#34; this book should serve as a 'reality check.' Poole repeatedly shows how the Western over-reliance on ordnance and technological superiority was effectively countered by adversaries who recognized the West's strengths and consciously decided to focus on small unit tactics and training.  Poole's message (some may call it a warning) is clear: the West will never live up to its military potential (or up to its over-inflated militarily superior opinion of itself) if it continues to ignore pursuing the tactical excellence needed to complement its unquestioned technological superiority. The real transformation or revolution in military affairs should be the paradigm shift to ensuring that our individuals and small units are as tactically proficient as they are technologically advanced.  This book can help all Western military decision-makers think differently about warfighting and can help save lives on the battlefield.	2002-04-09

Unlike his other books, (&#34;Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun&#34; and &#34;Victory Secrets of Attila the Hun&#34;) this one had a pervasive negative tone through use of many real-world &#34;what-not-to-do&#34; examples. This excessive negativity was de-motivating and made for heavy reading.  Roberts' strength is his use, understanding, and insightful leadership perspectives of historical figures. I learned a great deal about the myth of Achilles. Unfortunately, Roberts focused too many of his examples on the nine flaws of Achilles (disloyalty, greed, hostility, betrayal, withdrawal, inflexibility, deceit, vengeance, and arrogance) vice the nine shields of immortality (commitment, selflessness, cooperation, integrity, rigor, flexibility, honesty, respect, and humility).  I know there are many true stories of people in leadership positions who possess little to no true leadership qualities and lessons can be learned from them, but I prefer to read about true leaders who exemplify the true essence of leadership to learn what can be done. After reading his other two fine leadership books mentioned above, this book pales in comparison.	2002-04-04

I kept waiting for the book to suddenly come together and live up to its reputation, but it never did.  This book is an adventuresome story of Ender Wiggins, a young genius boy in a future universe where human survival is threatened by an alien &#34;bugger&#34; race.  Ender's life is a struggle as his family's third child in a society with a two-child limit law.  His life changes when he is `manipulated' into a training facility where he quickly becomes mankind's greatest military leader and ultimately saves the human race.  Card's detailed descriptions of the actions in and around the training facilities' Battle Room were fantastic and by far the best parts of the book.  I was taught in college that fiction writers (especially science fiction) should lead their readers into a &#34;willing suspension of disbelief.&#34;  That is, get them to willingly accept and believe in something that is not real.  Card was never able to get me to the point where I accepted or believed in a future world where genius adolescent children had such power and influence as Ender and his siblings and friends. The story flowed smoothly and I was easily able to follow it, but I just did not believe it.  I am not a big science fiction or fantasy reader, but I did read and enjoy Heinlein's &#34;Starship Troopers&#34; and &#34;Space Cadet,&#34; Robert Adams' &#34;Horseclans&#34; series, Barry Sadler's &#34;Casca&#34; series, and Robert E. Howard's &#34;Conan&#34; series (and most of the subsequent writers of Conan's adventures).  I was disappointed that this book was not as good as those books mentioned above and I have no intentions of reading the rest of the Ender series.	2002-04-03

Fortunately, the very first paragraph of the introduction put me at ease and tickled my curiosity when it revealed that the book had &#34;more than forty printings worldwide, translation into thirteen languages, and best-seller status in North America, Japan, South America, and parts of Europe.&#34;  Now, having read the book, I understand why it has achieved such extraordinary success.  The authors did a fantastic job of transforming cold statistics into meaningful analysis and then translating their analysis into plain language for students of management and leadership.  Their many examples and common-sense conclusions were easy to understand and believe.  Whether you are a CEO or a technician on the line, and work in a multi-national corporation or a small local business, this book's lessons can apply to you.	2002-04-03

I like to experiment with different authors and books about management and leadership. My readings include, but are not limited to, the works of William J. Bennett, Ken Blanchard, James Collins, Dr. Stephen R. Covey, H.W. Crocker, W. Edwards Deming, Viktor Frankl, Lou Holtz, Dr. Spencer Johnson, General John A. LeJeune (USMC), Vince Lombardi, Miyamoto Musashi, William Oncken, General George Patton (USA), Rick Pitino, Steven Pressfield, Wess Roberts, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, Robert Schuller, Hyrum Smith, Major General Perry Smith (USAF), Sun Tzu, and John Wooden. This book does not make my listing of the top 50 leadership, management, or character refinement books I read.<br /><br />Besides never having read any of Bennis' books before, I was attracted to &#34;On Becoming A Leader&#34; by the front cover's announcement, &#34;The Leadership Classic Recommended by Vice President Al Gore to All His Advisors.&#34; Unfortunately, I believe Mr. Gore's recommendation was largely based on Bennis' obvious political leanings that permeated the book. The political overtones were distracting and definitely detracted from Bennis' credibility in presenting his ideas.<br /><br />While I found certain sections of the book interesting, overall the book failed to inspire me to think introspectively about leadership like the works of the authors listed above.	2002-04-01

I re-read this book and found it better the second time around.  Even though I would not call this book one of the best leadership books I have read, I am glad I decided to read it again with a much more open and receptive mind.  <br />Bennis' scholarly approach to the subject of leadership was generally interesting and at times a little too much and too long-winded for my tastes.  What I liked best about this book is that it dealt with leaders and developing leadership from a `self-made' perspective.  One of the book's main themes is that \\"each of us contains the capacity for leadership.\\"  What I liked least about the book was Bennis' blatant liberal political preferences, which I felt strongly detracted from his message and credibility.  I now understand why the front cover proudly proclaims that this book was recommended by Vice President Al Gore to all his advisers.<br />In a lot of ways, he challenged many of my personal beliefs and pre-conceived notions about leaders and leadership.  Bennis reinforced his own points with many quotes, stories, and anecdotes from profiling close to thirty leaders.  Even his choice of leaders was challenging for me as he included many folks from fields not normally associated with strong leadership traditions (i.e. Hollywood, entertainment industry, etc.) and excluded the more common strong leadership traditions fields such as sports, the military, and elected government officials.  <br />Once I was able to get beyond the book's faults and shortcomings, Bennis had enough good ideas and observations to keep me interested and entertained.  This book is not one I would recommend making a special effort to get and read, but if it was readily available and you had the time, I believe it would certainly be worthwhile to give it a try.	2002-03-27
