I've been a huge fan of Catherine Spangler's since I devoured her first two books SHIELDER AND SHADOW CROSSING. I eagerly and anxiously look forward to each and every one of her fabulous futuristic romances.  These books are simply brilliant!  I only wish she would write faster!  Of course, I read these books in one sitting.  <br />I had been waiting for Celie Cameron's story for ages and was so glad for it to finally have been written.  She was paired up with the perfect hero in Rurik.  This book couldn't have been more adventuresome!  I know I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.  <br />Keep on bringing 'em on, Catherine Spangler!  I'll be here to read and enjoy them!!	2003-04-13

Her mother, a failed time traveler, decides that Janice should travel to the medieval age to prevent the devastatingly deadly plague.<br />Jan goes back in time with all sorts of surgical instruments and equipment from the future. She appears at the cottage of Ethelred, a barber/surgeon who was burned at the stake for washing his hands and instruments, just before he's killed. She convinces King Edward and everyone else that she's from the future and is there to help. Will she succeed without messing up the future and more importantly, does she care? <br />Without a doubt, this is one of the funniest time travels I have ever read. The heroine changes history as we know it. It's enjoyable from a time travel or historical standpoint, but also as a comedic farce of a tried-and-true genre. <br />Kathy Boswell, Romantic Times Book Club	2003-01-08

While I will admit this book was quite titillating in it's content, I must also admit I was a bit uncomfortable with the dominant/submissive role played in this book.  I guess I'm just too much of a `dyed in the wool' traditional monogamist. <br /> Annie Cavendish is a schoolteacher with a new lover, Mark. He's a great lover but he has another side to him that she doesn't know about.  He wants to initiate her very slowly as not to scare her.  Mark is a dominant and wants Annie to be his submissive in all ways.  This takes time and while Annie is amenable in some ways, in other way she's very hesitant. She just needs to have her mindset changed a bit.  It's up to Mark and his special set of friends to help Annie out.  Will it be worth it in the end and will Annie finally go along?<br /> I will say that I enjoyed reading this book and it was quite a change for me from what I normally read.  It did open my mind and my eyes to another way of life.   <BR>Kathy Boswell, The Best Reviews	2002-09-02

Dixie LePage has just found out that she's the sole heir of her two great aunts who lived in Bringham, England. Her grandmother had broken from her family when she married and moved to America. She always called her sisters witches but Dixie didn't know she meant that literally.<br /> Dixie decides to travel to Bringham to see for herself just what she's inherited.  When she arrives, a smarmy man tries to pick her up at the airport.  She discourages him and finally finds a place where she can rent a small car reasonably.  Then she gets the run around while trying to not only see Orchard House but trying to fix it up in anticipation of either living there or selling it.  <br /> Sebastian Caughleigh, her great-aunt's lawyer, does everything in his power to discourage Dixie from even staying.  He has a hidden agenda going on that he most especially doesn't want Dixie finding out about.  It could ruin everything he's ever strived for. His nephew James as well as several women in the neighborhood is all in on trying to discourage Dixie from wanting to stay.<br /> Then Dixie meets Christopher Marlowe. As she gets to know him, she finds that she's falling in love with him.  What she doesn't know is that Christopher is `THE' Christopher Marlowe and he's a 400-year-old vampire.  What in world will Dixie do when she figures out this little detail?  <br /> This campy, seductive and downright fun vampire novel was an irresistible read.  I simply could not put it down once I started reading it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and cannot wait to read the sequel to this most intriguing book!  <br />Kathy Boswell, The Best Reviews	2001-12-31

Dixie has opened a shop called The Vampire Emporium, eight-year-old Sam Schwartz's favorite place to go. Stella, Sam's mom isn't too sure about this place but Dixie is very nice so she tolerates it for Sam's benefit.<br /> Doctor Justin Corvus, whom we met in WALK IN MOONLIGHT, has come for an extended visit. When he meets Stella, something just clicks.  He knows nothing can come of it but there's just something about Stella that just draws him. When Justin finds out that Stella is taking Sam out for Begger's Night, he tells her she must bring Sam by the shop.  Dixie and Kit are going all out and Sam will really enjoy it.  Stella has reservations but agrees to bring Sam by.  When Justin finds out that Sam wants to dress up as a vampire for Halloween, he talks Dixie into making him a costume from remnants so Stella won't get suspicious. This just about wins Stella over but still she isn't sure about this handsome hunk of a man interested in her.<br /> It seems as though Justin has gotten the neighborhood bullies angry with Stella when he tells them to stop breaking bottles on her garage door.  Johnny Day, the worst bully of all vows to get even with her and with Justin.  Late one night he does just that when he pulls a gun on Stella and Justin.  Justin steps in front of Stella but the bullet passes right through him and kills Stella.  Justin rushes Stella to Dixie and Kit's where they talk him into transforming her.  Justin doesn't want to lose her and even though he has reservations he transforms Stella.  Now how will this affect Stella's life and especially Sam?  <br /> Justin's and Stella's story was every bit as good as Christopher's and Dixie's.  I was glued to the pages and couldn't wait to see what would happen with Justin and Stella and how they would deal with day-to-day life with an eight-year-old.  Rosemary Laurey threw in quite a few intriguing aspects to make this book justa bit more interesting!  I eagerly look forward to the next book in this highly entertaining series.<br />Kathy Boswell, The Best Reviews	2001-12-31

Her SHIELDER series is just brilliant! I looked for the first book of this marvelous series forever and finally Catherine sent it to me herself when she asked me to review SHADOWER, the second book of this series. I have thoroughly enjoyed this whole series and SHAMARA is no exception.<br /> SHAMARA is the story of Jarek san Ranul and Eirene Kane and what a story it is!  This story takes us all over the galaxy and back again.  Eirene is an Enhancer but she does everything in her power to try to hide the fact.  Controllers have already wiped out the Enhancer population but a few still pop up every now and again.  When Jarek suspects what Eirene is, he tries his best to get her to help but she's denied the fact that she is an Enhancer for so long she refuses and tells him he's mistaken.  Unfortunately circumstances are working against Eirene and time is of the essence to Jarek. Jarek cannot let the Controllers wipe out any more Shielder colonies. It is just too heartbreaking to hear about another whole colony being decimated without one survivor. Pretty soon the Shielder population will be as non-existent as the Enhancer population. Can Jarek finally convince Eirene to help him and can they eventually admit their love for each other? What will Eirene do when she finds out that Jarek killed her father?  How will Jarek tell her that her father was a traitor to the Shielder population and an evil man and that Jarek had to kill him so he wouldn't kill another Shielder. <br /> This world that Catherine Spangler has created is as real to me as it can be.  The characters are amazing and the fact that I can visit all of the beloved characters over again in each and every book is just a bonus in my opinion.  Even though each story is a stand alone, the books are all that much better when they are read together!  I eagerly look forward to Catherine Spangler's next book.

As much as I enjoyed THE STAR KING, I could not imagine enjoying a sequel any more but I must say that I did!  THE STAR PRINCE is every bit as wonderful as THE STAR KING was!<br /> This is the story of Ian Hamilton, Rom's stepson. Rom has thrown Ian a curve when he named him as his successor to the throne. There are those Vash individuals who feel an Earth dweller would not make a good successor. Ian has been given a secret mission to check out the Frontier but not only does his ship keep getting sabotaged but his pilots keeping drinking themselves to death.<br /> Tee'ah Dar, Rom's niece, has been a good Vash all of her life but all she wants to do is fly.  When her parents tell her they have made arrangements for her marriage, she runs away. She runs into Ian at Donavan's Blunder when Dar guards confiscate her stolen star cruiser and leave her stranded.  Ian has never met her so he doesn't know who she is. When he finds out she's a pilot he hires her right away. This is only the beginning.  <br /> Hang on to your hats for a wild ride through space.  This is a one sitting read. I know I stayed up far to late in the night reading just one more chapter to this incredible book.  I know I, for one, will be avidly awaiting to see what Susan Grant will come up with next.	2001-11-22

She almost always gets her man even if she does  have some risque ways of going about it.  Her boss has given her one more  chance to redeem herself or she's to be shown the door. Now she's on the  trail of a jewel thief. She's tracked him down to Las Vegas and has only  one more chance to nab him.  She has jewels and a sexy expensive  dress.<br />Simon &quot;Beau&quot; Beaulieux is in Las Vegas too. He's there  to track down his elusive black sheep cousin Remi.  Remi, it seems, has  made off with the family jewels.  Beau has to catch him before his dying  grandmother finds out about the theft.<br />Now, picture, if you will, Kit and  Beau meeting over a poker table.  Kit mistakenly thinks that Beau is the  jewel thief she's after.  They are down to just Beau and Kit at the table  and Kit makes a reckless bet. She bets her expensive dress.  Whoops, she  loses! <br />Before it's all said and done, Kit has followed Beau down to San  Deigo looking for Remi.  She's shot in the arm and now Beau has decided  that he has to protect her.  Then there's the story of the  legend......<br />This was one of the hottest, sexiest books I've ever read.   The sparks between Kit and Beau fairly burn holes in this book. I  thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more books  from Nina.	2000-02-08

I read THE BRIDE FINDER and of course, was anxiously awaiting the sequel.  I will have to say that THE NIGHT DRIFTER did not disappoint in the least.  The story of Lance and Rosalind was intriguing, to say the least.  Susan  Carroll has created a very interesting family in the St. Legers.  I am  hoping there will be more stories about this strange and wonderful family!	1999-04-18

I honestly did not want to stop reading about the MacKinnons and the Clarens. Donna did a wonderful job of weaving the three stories together into one  wonderful, beautiful story.  Her next book can't be published soon enough  for me.	1999-04-18

I loved the way she took Jericho Beaumont down to the depths and brought him back up to the top. She did a wonderful job with the lead characters in Heartthrob.  The sexual  tension between Jericho and Kate was so thick you could almost see it.  I  thought Kate was the perfect foil for Jericho.  She also made great use of  her secondary characters, especially Susie and Jamaal.  She threaded their  story through very nicely. Suzanne Brockmann is an automatic buy for me.	1999-04-18

The characters were wonderful.  I love the legend aspect of the story.  The ending was a total surprise to me.  I am looking forward to the sequel.  It  can't be written too soon for me.	1999-03-31
