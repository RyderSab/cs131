It communicates all of the basics that are required. <br /> <br />I've attended one of this consulting group's manufacturing classes.  I found them to be dead on.  I like the way they handled the accounting/cost/metric relationship to lean production.  Basically, the current accounting standards will cause you to do things in opposition to what lean principles will have you do. <br /> <br />In some other office scenarios, I think this more traditional approach will not have all the pieces or tools required.  I work in an industry where order entry is significantly more complex than the examples presented, a much higher degree of interaction with other players is required, and rework loops are significant part of the process (customer driven rework).  ANITECH has an approach that tracks the information flow surrounding the work process, while applying the same lean techniques that are presented in this book.   <br /> <br />Tracking the information flow provides an opportunity to sort out, automate, and lean out that information flow.  There is tremendous leverage in this concept.	2005-10-10
US	52572139	R2B42WKKX0SEXZ	0393020223	746851988	The Future of Spacetime	Books	4	5	5	N	Y	Interesting thinking on the edge of knowledge	This a book derived from 5 physicists who gave a discourse to honor Kip Thorne on his 60th birthday.  If you're interested in the musings of some of the greatest minds in science, this is an excellent book.  Absent is the mathematics that gives substance to the thoughts, which makes this subject very approachable to the lay audience. <br /> <br />The topics are far ranging in the field of physics and the discussions are beyond the edge of what is currently provable.  This is the area of where knowledge meets intuition, where great theories and insight are born. <br /> <br />If time travel, the universe as four dimensions, and related subjects are not for you, then this isn't the book for you.  If your interested in the thoughts that will propel further investigation in the quest for knowledge and understanding, this is an excellent book.	2005-09-01

Overall, I found the book to be well written, personal, and filled with principles, explanations, and anecdotes. <br /> <br />Each principle is explained in a manner that should strike a cord in many people.  He supports the concept embodied by the principle with anecdotes, both personal and historical. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book to help with interpersonal relationships, this is a good book to to start with.  John covers a lot of ground in this book. <br /> <br />That would be my major criticism of the book.  There are many, many strategies and approaches, and keeping track can get confusing.  They are well organized.  This will have to be a book that you refer back to as issues in your life come up and you are looking for help. <br /> <br />I think Covey's work is more managable and priciple system oriented, but that shouldn't detract from John's work.  There is an unlying system, but John's approach appears to be more of set of tools to help you, with each dealing with a specific type of problem.	2005-08-26

The advertisement for the book lead me to beleive that it was something different.  I enjoyed and learned from the book. <br /> <br />What the book was to me is a personal history of the introduction of lean to the US.  Mr. Bodek was a key and instrumental force in doing so.  From that perspective the book fills in a lot of gaps of how things happened and who played what role.  The book also gives a great overview of what Lean (Toyota Production System, TPS) is and how it is applied, and who the key players were/are and an insight to their personalities. <br /> <br />The book is not a detailed examination of the production system.  If you are looking for that, Mr. Bodek gives references to other books published by his company translated from the original Japanese.  This gives you insight to those works and which to chose from.  This, in and of itself, is worth the price of this book. <br /> <br />The book does cover the major topics of the TPS and gives plenty of examples and implementation stories.  The stories are great in themsleves, and a great insight to the way of Japanese management.  Mr. Bodek is a strong proponent of that style.  It also goes into some biographies of the key players in the process.  It hits on Demings' and Juran's impact in Japan. <br /> <br />The war stories of the industrial touring trips to Japan were interesting.  The problems faced by jumping in to the publishing opportunities to present the original works to a new audience were facinating business stories.   <br /> <br />The biggest AHA moment for me was the discussion on Quick and Easy Kaizen, or the Japanese implementation of a sugggestion system.  Radically different from any I've seen in the US outside of Honda and Toyota. <br /> <br />If your looking for a fast easy read on the history of bringing Lean to the US  and the key underpinnings of the process to include a good description of the key components with annecdotes, this is thebook for you.  If your looking to understand lean and find other references of use to you, this is the book for you.  If your insterested in filling in some knowledge gaps of how and why some things happened, again, this is for you.  If your looking for specific action items to implement specific components, go elsewhere, or use this book as a guide.	2005-05-03
US	52572139	R2UPEXI4QHP9PY	0743237919	616537910	The Testosterone Advantage Plan: Lose Weight, Gain Muscle, Boost Energy	Books	4	26	26	N	Y	Excellent Resource for Beginner and Advanced	I just finished the book.  I've been working with a trainer for over a year, and have seen great changes in physique, and some weight reduction (10 lbs).  Just some background for the review.  I thought the book was very good but not great, and the areas of concern have to do with the some of science of their claims (they rail against small sample sizes in the studies and their cases studies are small samples).  Regardless: <br /> <br />The book is in three sections; first the \\"T\\" plan and why it is better than other programs or fads out their for their target audience; secondly, is the sample diet plan; finally, it is the work out plan in 3 stages. <br /> <br />The target audience appears very similar to the Men's Health audience.  The authors are explict in that they are adressing the 35 year old male who is 20-30 lbs overweight and wants to change.  The goal is a blatantly male physique, akin to the cover models of Men's Health and not that of Mr. Universe. <br /> <br />The authors take you through a review of the current science on nutrition and exercise.  You find out pretty quickly that though there is a great deal of information, there are just as many holes and unknowns in the current body of knowledge.  The authors do a pretty good job of identifing what is based on sound science, what is cutting edge and not yet supported by large clinical trials, and what is supposition and educated guess work based on anecdotal evidence and experience.  <br /> <br />Most of the most interesting stuff is based on small sample studies or interpreted data based on studies of interest but not exclusively focused on the authors topic.  The bottomline to all this is the author's position that diet fads (Atkins, low-no fat, etc) and the Agriculture Departments Food Pyramid are junk.  To get in decent shape and maintain it takes a different diet (\\"T\\" Plan), coupled with overall body exercise that builds muscle (aerobics doesn't). <br /> <br />The authors describe their ideal diet which is similar to the mediterranean diet, 1/3 fat, 1/3 protein, 1/3 carbs.  This is adjusted to accomodate the different goals of specific individuals, fat loss (authors emphasize \\"fat loss\\"), body composition change (weight maintenance with fat loss), weight/muscle mass gain. <br /> <br />The authors give you the tools to determine the ideal daily caloric intake based on their best guess of the ideal protein intake.  The focus is on determining protein needs (takes protein to build muscle) and then splitting the rest between carbs and fat.  The authors go through a fairly indepth review of the right kinds of fat to eat, monounsaturated.  This information is then converted to grams for you to develop a diet to fit the need.   <br /> <br />The authors give 3 sample 1 week plans as an example and recommend that you vary it by checking the labels on foods to keep the ratio of fat, protien, and carbs in the correct proportion. <br /> <br />The workout plan makes sense and was in line with what my trainer put me through.  The assumption is a guy who hasn't worked out in a while and the plan is based on crawl before you walk before you run progression.  Stage 1 is to tone up and prepare your body for the work to come.  The second stage is to build strength and keep the muscles in balance.  The last stage is to build strength and muscle. <br /> <br />Overall, the plan appears reasonable, sustainable (you won't starve, get to eat meat, and 2000-3000 calories per day over 3 meals and 2 snacks), and safe.  The authors go out of their way to make sure you do the workouts safely, why go through all this and get hurt. <br /> <br />They do discuss supplements, generally against, aerobics vs resistance training, pro resistance, and offer what to do after 9 weeks.  I'm planning on keeping my trainers workout but adjust my diet to more along the lines of authors recommendations. <br /> <br />P.S. - no alcohol - they don't call is a beer gut for nothing.	2004-12-30

I'm a trained kaizen facilitator and 6 sigma black belt, just background for my review.    Having read the book, I found it is a sound introductory read for those looking to understand how lean and 6 sigma can transform a business.  The target audience for this is managers and executive contemplating initiating this process.    The authors do a great job of providing war stories of successes within thier client base.  They present the basics of the tools involved.  They explain what is expected of management to make an implementation successful.    If you are loooking for the details on how to get it done, I'd go to other books (anything by Shingo, or go to Productivity Press).  As with many consultant books, this has the feel of a marketing tool to promote their consultancy.  TBM is regarded and one of the best if not the best in \\"Lean\\" in this country.    Things that Anand pointed out, but some one with little experience may not pick up on  are:  *Continuous improvement is a journey and not a destination  *Senior management MUST be directly involved for success  *Use the gains to grow the business  *Standard work IS the discipline in the process  *Everything must be looked at from the customer's perspective    These may not be new or exciting, but very true and often difficult maintain.  I liked the book.  I did not get out of it what I expected (more detail and insight), but I learned a few things.  I can recommend the book as  a starter book for some one to gain an insight on what it takes and at a high level how it works.	2004-12-12
US	52572139	R1ARQQJLJL3O75	0385502885	46586012	Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instincts Will Make You Better at What You Do	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	Intuition vs Analysis	This is a great follow-up to Gary Klein's previous work \\"Sources of Power\\".  Where \\"Sources\\" is more about how intuition is used and his theories about it, \\"Intuition at Work\\" is more a practical guide on how to apply the theory and its implications.<br /><br />Gary tries to demystify \\"intuition\\" by stating his defintion of intuition as experience put into practice.  Through this defintion, Gary tries to answer the question, how does one become expert in their craft/profession through their cumulative experience, and how do they apply that experience.  He gives many examples of this.<br /><br />Through out the book, Gary is driving the point that intuition is a developed sense through the honing of experience into recognizable patterns for future use.  This pattern recognition capability differentiates the novice or journeyman from the truly expert; examples given are the experiences of the neonatal intensive care nurses (those who can sense a problem before other nurses or the measurement equipment, the experience of the marine NCO who can sense the order of battle from subtle signs that the team leader in the middle of the exercise is totally missing.  The individual usually has no idea how he/she goes about pattern recognition, hence the mystical connotation of intuition.<br /><br />Deeper in the book, he gives practical advise on how the individual can develop their own expertise, and how to structure training /development experiences to foster the growth of the intuitive decision making.  There is also an excellent chapter on coaching.<br /><br />Though he very much bashes the analytical approach, he keeps resorting back to it to prove certain points.  There is an execellent chapter on the short comings on purely quantitative measures for management, and how they need to be integrated with knowledge of the process of the measures (where they come from, and their reliability).  In 6 Sigma this is called Measure System Analysis (MSA, gauge R&R being a component of it).<br /><br />From a 6 sigma perspective, I think this approach is entirely compatible (not withstanding the author's negative position on analytical decision making), but they are mutually support and not mutually exclusive.  The basic idea on intuitive decision making is that there are times and situations that are either time dependant(heat of battle) or at a strategic level (data points in many directions) where data will fall short.<br /><br />In the heat of battle is not the time for a 6 sigma design of experiments.  However, the DOE (or other analysis) is very appropriate to expand the process knowledge and drive better future decisions based on sound current experience.<br /><br />The author does cover training methods and allowing the student to make mistakes that expand their knowledge based and mental models.  It is in providing sound mental models that I think the analytic will shine in providing correct mental models.<br /><br />Since the author was focused on supporting the importance of the intuitive approach, there was little mention of the limitiations of the aproach.  Experience in 6 Sigma teaches that the teams hunches often are proven wrong with the data.  I suspect this is due to limitations of their mental models and the rigorousness in which the mental models are developed and tested.  A good book that covers some of this is Peter Senge's \\"The Fifth Discipline\\".<br /><br />A key issue that Senge writes about is that many times there are time delays from and action to true response.  The time delay is not always apparent.  The person then developes a mental model of an action and apparent response that is then flawed.  I think this tends to, among other reasons, lead to crisis management/band-aid approach to fixing problems as opposd to true corrective action.  How many times has a manager or supervisor \\"fixed\\" a problem, only to have it crop up a week, month, or 6 months later.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially for trainers, 6 sigma practioners, and managers.	2004-10-11

In essence, the author proposes that everyone knows about the major battles, and major battles have impact since they usually impact the outcome a war, but they minor battles can create ripples in history that have an effect on future events that may be more signficant than the battles everyone knows about.<br />The author selects the Battle of Okinawa, The Battle of Shiloh, and the Battle of Delium.  The ripple effects are derived from the impact these battles had on the participants.  To most people, these battles are minor and obscure.  Okinawa shouldn't be, but was overshadowed by other events.<br />The key point of Okinawa (aside from the author's personal interest, a relative died there) was western culture's reaction to suicide bombings that Japanese used in the battle and the significance of the desire to fight to the last regardless of the outcome.  The Japanese were fighting to extract casualties and for strategic advantage.  The hope was to deter the imminent invasion of the home islands.  The ripple here is the parallel of what we might do faced with Islamic extremists.  In WWII, we used the A-Bomb on Japan, and Afganistan we are using Daisy Cutters.<br />In Shiloh, which probably the author's strongest argument, the battle impacted the pyschology of the south (The Lost Opportunity), the key focus of two generals ideas about prosecuting the war (Sherman and Grant), and how in a few moments careers are made and broken (Lew Wallace).  All of these had impact far beyond the battle, the war, and the century.  <br />Victor Hanson is an excellent writer and brings and interesting perspective to the subject.  This is a very good book and well worth reading, it will make you think.  (Chaos theory which an example is the fluttering of a butterfly in China impacts the weather in North America.)	2004-06-09

It had some short comings, and I get to those, but it did make approachable some of what astronomers do and how they do it.  The book is basically a historical narrative of the science of astronomy and cosmology, and how they are continuously striving to answer some basic questions:  How old is the Earth and consequently the Universe?;  What is the nature of that Universe?<br />In this regard, the book does very well.  It introduces historical figures, what they did, how they did it, who they influenced, and a few interesting side trips to historical oddities that later proved prescient.  There are historically significant people, and people significant only to the field in the book.  The book however, is not so much about people as the questions asked (fundamentally remaining unchanged), the answers each generation uncovered (constantly changing with new insight and new precision of the fundamental technology), and the politics of the scientific community.<br />The author makes approachable aspects of the theories of Einstein, Newton, Quantum Mechanics, the inner workings of stars and how this influenced astronomy.  This is were the author is strongest.<br />The weak areas are primarily in the paucity if figures, diagrams, and pictures to highlight and illustrate key techniques, theories, and technologies.<br />What impressed me the most is how the science of astronomy and cosmology are built on estimates, built on assumptions, tied to just a few laws of nature or knowns.  The answers the participants in the field devine from their work is constantly being refined as the estimates and assumptions are better understood or tossed out.	2004-05-02
US	52572139	R2JJ3S7XYVCC4L	0071408649	277176599	Leadership Lessons of the U.S. Navy SEALS  : Battle-Tested Strategies for Creating Successful Organizations and Inspiring Extraordinary Results	Books	4	12	13	N	Y	Extraordinary Teams	I liked the book.  I think it hit the mark for it's intended audience.  The lessons learned from the school of hard knocks are clear, simple, direct; very military at the front lines.  Each point is illustraged with a war story from both the civilian and military perspective.  Being ex-military I liked the war stories.<br />The lessons are very useful, but like many books of its ilk, not new.  The key lessons were learned and documented many years ago by the Greeks and Romans.  I think the thing to keep in mind is that communication has not ocurred until both sides understand the message.  In that line, I think this book does a very good job of describing key leadership traits and tools and introducing them to a new audience.<br />The book is organized by chapters, and key points and illustrations within each.  There are contradictions in the points that are not brought up or discussed.  I think this is true due to the nature of human interaction and its complexities, that a tool or technique works until it doesn't.  The key is for the leader to recognized the difference.  The book is weak here, but I also think that is something better learned from experience.<br />Some major take aways for me was the dicussion on organizational structure, the need to follow SOP, until there is a greater need to not, good leadership demands good followership, followers have major responsibilities towards their leaders (how and when to tell the boss the path we are following is wrong).<br />For me this is not new, but it is great to be reminded of these things.  This book is not the best I have read on the topic, but very useful for the key insights form practical life and death experience.	2004-03-17

That is where the real bonding and intimacy is.  I can't say I'm confortable with everything they ask...just one of those quiet unemotional types.<br />This is good for any couple, but I think the intended audience are for beginning couples, and even better when you are thinking about marriage.<br />There are many chapters dealing with a relationship topic.  It would be good to cover 1-2 a week.  This would be a very good couple devotional book to work through.	2004-02-20

Goldratt in &quot;The Goal&quot;.  This is a novel about a production plant, suffering many or all of the problems very common in industry in varying degrees.  I was expecting more of a treatise on 6-sigma, and the managmeent thereof, but then I didn't investigate the book that well.<br />If you are looking for an introduction to 6-sigma, how to develop an implementation plan, and see how it can play out, this is a good read, just as The Goal is good in what it does.<br />The book is a good read, effective for what the author intended, but if you are experienced or knowledgeable, who may want to pass.  I would refer it to someone looking to investigate 6 sigma.	2004-02-10

I have not tried using the princicples presented, but they are detailed, clear, and I think they would work.<br />The authors take you through the whole process of presentation (how you should look and act, more clean yourself up than changing what you are), where to meet and how to talk to a woman and it is a numbers game, how to flirt and get a priming date (safe location to explore if you really want to date the girl with an exit strategy), seduction date(s), and what to do thereafter....<br />The book is thick and full of details.  I think this is the place to start if you are looking for a book in this genre.	2004-01-04
US	52572139	R2IYXWCYGRJMIH	0130084573	625511267	Leading Six Sigma: A Step-by-Step Guide Based on Experience with GE and Other Six Sigma Companies	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	The 6 Sigma Book for Leaders Planning a Deployment	Of the many books I've read on 6 sigma, this IS the book on how to plan and deploy a 6 Simga initiative in a company.  This is not a book on the tools and how to use them in detail.  It is discussed, but more in terms of highlighting the training required and the caliber of people assigned.  <br />There is a comparison and contrast of successful deployments and less successful deployments.  The authors disect why they failed.  They have a GE bias, in that at least on of the authors is heavily versed in the GE system.  This is not to the detriment of the book, but it does color the successful path they advocate.  That path is well trod and proven successful.  There are variations to that that can be successful, and will depend heavily on the culture of the company.<br />The path they advocate attacks the common organization barriers that ANY initiative will face.  So in that sense, the book is broader that just 6 simga.  Those elements are:<BR>* Active and strong leadership from the top<br />* Appropriate resources, people and funding<BR>* Demand results<BR>* Be willing to change internal policies and procedure to support implementation<br />This is a must read for anyone planning an implementation, or looking to fix one.	2003-11-03

Many people have been out of school for a long time or never got into the statistics of 6 sigma before.  The goal was to find a primer to help them over the hump before the training.<br />I found this book to he helpful to me, and have to test it on someone less familar with statistics.<br />What I liked about it is that it covered 90% of the topics I needed, ANOVA, multi-variate statistics, DOE, and non-parametrics are not included.  It did provide a clear, concise description of the topics in a manner that should not lose non-mathematicans.  It is not rigorous like a text book, but does a descent job of explaining things in lay language while attempting to bridge the gap between lay language and more correct useage.<br />My search was not exhustive, but I like this book, and I know it helped one co-worker understand the basics in her college stats course.<br />Where I found it a little weak is in describing the mathematical notations used (summation signs, etc.).  It could have been a little stronger at translating the statistics in to practical useage in the real world.	2003-10-16
US	52572139	R18D1J2Y2H7CWZ	1880156059	617016057	Knowledge Based Management: Unleashing the Power of Quality Improvement	Books	4	6	6	N	N	A Primer on Process Improvement	I thought the book was an excellent introduction to the topic of process improvement, where the author argues that we should manage processes from the vantage point of knowledge of them.  By this they mean more than knowing how the work gets done, but what is the cost of failure, what are the key defect types, what are the sources of the defects, and knowing the tools to address these issues.    If you are an expert in the topics of quality, process management, 6 sigma, this may not be the book for you to expand your knowledge.  This may be a good book for you to use as a tool to help a manager, colleague, or someone less familar get a grounding.  There is a good discussion of problem solving, the requisite tools, process mapping, and a good primer on why it is important to business.    I would read Demings \\"Out of the Crisis\\", and then pick up this book.  There are may others that I would include on the list, but this is a good start.    If you are looking for an excellent discussion on DOE, Taguachi Techniques, and other sophisticated methods, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for a well thoughout introduction to the idea that we need to solve problems by fixing processes and not people, this is an excellent book.	2003-10-13
US	52572139	RC8JB5DOOTI2Q	1893554244	392253978	The Eleven Days of Christmas: America's Last Vietnam Battle	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	Some things never change	I found the book so facinating that I read it in 12 hrs.  Part of my interest is that I flew on G's as an RN for 5 yrs in the 80's.  I heard the urban legends, myths, and other stories surround the Linebacker II operation.  This book rings true on many levels.<br />The author introduces the subject with a bit of history on the USAF and Strategic Air Command.  He did gloss over some details, like LeMay taking a rag tag outfit of cobbled together units and forging SAC in his own image.  But this is a minor point.  The author is setting up the cultural conflict in SAC that is evident in the events of Linebacker II.  And this rings so true, many of the cultural artifacts were still in existence in 1989.<br />There is the discussion on how SAC developed and was involved in the conflicts of Korea and Viet Nam.  How the culture of zero mistakes and top down decision making, thought necessary for a nuclear excahnge where it is likely you are going with what you have, doesn't fit the conventional battlefield.  In the conventional battel field, you go back day after day.<br />The author then takes you to the policitcal decision making that lead up to the battle of Linebacker II, and the squawbling of the generals.  It was faciniating, that the bottomline to the battle and the return to the peace table had less to do with the destruction on the ground than the political wills of the leaders, manifested in the battle itself. The fact that Nixon held the line and forced the bombing to continue, even after the NV signaled their desire to go back, signaled that Nixon was one to be dealt with and that the NV need to work with him to get a deal.<br />The book then goes to the day by day activities of the battle, from both the aircrew and and NVA side.  From the aircrew side, the author did his homework and though not loosing the audience in the detail and minutia of the cockpit, his descriptions ring true.  I never had the opportunity to work the ASQ-38 offensive system, (I was oneof the first to be totaly trained on the replacement OAS system), I worked with many who had and the details are there.<br />In the day to day activities, the author describes the problems created by the command structure, the lower commands reactions and attempts to compensate and correct, and how that interaction played out.  He also provides vivid descriptions of the actual engagements and tactics used, how the tactics faired, and the response on both sides to gain advantage.<br />I thought the book was superb example of military history focused on a pivital battle in the war.  It provides enough detail for people familar with the military and the systems, but doesn't get bogged down to lose the uninitiated.  It provides great insight in the thought process and cultural history of the services and the different commands with the USAF.  Many of these issues exist even today.<br />I especially like the discussion of the urban legend of the mutiny within the crew force.  In my day, the story became that the crews mutined during a CINCSAC vist to Andersen AFB Guam, during the Linebacker II operation.  This mutiny forced CINCSAC to hurriedly leave the base to save his skin.  Having read the book, I could see the grains of truth in the legend, and how it merged over time, coupled with the modern crew force twisting it to meet their personal desires.  Having been a &quot;Crewdog&quot;,  I can see how the U-Tapo story got twisted in to a mutiny, and the consequent disregard of orders that were blatantly stupid in combat, and the blending of the cold reception of the CINCSAC after the battle into the modern legend.	2003-10-13

The authors purposely reiterated certain key concepts that for me was a detractor, but for some one new to the subject they are talking about may not be.<br />Taking the authors process in components, there is nothing truly new here.  What is new is the process they propose?  The tieing together of the different elements to develop critical information to determine a business fit between the customer and your organization and presenting that to the key decision maker. Again, nothing technically new, but well presented in a well designed process of gathering data to prepare for research interviews with people in the customer's organization to gain the necessary coaches and insight to prepare a presentation to the decision maker. <br />Though this process is designed for the sales professional, it is useful for others.  How many managers, engineers, accountants, etc, need to propose business solutions, initiatives, or other major projects to senior managers?  Many I would suppose.  This is an excellent process (with minor adjustments for internal use) for you too.  Basically how to present a project top gain the attention and support of a decision maker.<br />I can not make a personal testamonial to any success using this process at this time, but am planning to.	2003-10-08

The focus is on how to sell Quality/Process Improvement to business leaders and peers without drowning them in the technical minutia that may turn them off, thus losing the energy of a good implementation.  The author then takes the approach of  how to market Quality/Process Improvement from the perspective of a marketing professional.  <br />The author then moves on to the difference between quality and value.  This is a very good discussion on quality from a customer's perspective and what they perceive as quality and as value.  <br />The discussion then moves into the area of internal customers, and why the concept's time has passed.  What you should focus on, per the author,  is getting everyone to focus on the customer, moving the organizational focus external of the company from an generally internal one.<br />The book was not what I expected, but I enjoyed it.  I liked it, but  my opinion is that it is for the quality profession who is interested in reading something well written that will challenge some base assumptions and makes you think about some foundational concepts.  There are good nuggets here with a lot of narrative.	2003-06-04

De ja vu all over again.  D. Abrashoff graduated the USN Academy in 1982, I graduated the USAF Academy in 1983, a comtemporary of mine then.  Reading his book reminded me of all the things I suffered through my tour of active duty.  It also reminded me of the basics I was taught at MY academy.  On a theoretical level, nothing new here.  On a practical level, this book is a gem, and I have just recommended it to my process improvement team.<br />The book is packed full of some ones learning on how to implement what a lot of other books explain in theory.  The author doesn't plot out checklists, but gives meaningful anecdotes to explain his experience and point he is making.  His key points are the chapter headings:<BR>Take Command<BR>Lead by Example<BR>Listen Agressively<BR>Communicate Purpose and Meaning<BR>Create a Climate of Trust<BR>Look for Results, Not Salutes<BR>Take Calculated Risks<BR>Go Beyond Standard Procedure<BR>Build Up Your People<BR>Generate Unity<BR>Improve Your People's Quality of Life<br />A key take away for me, and in my experience, it is one thing to &quot;COPY EXACTLY&quot; (stealing an Intel term), it is another to understand the principle.  By his examples, he indicates that other ships copied techniques (benchmarking) and improved specific areas of performance (all good), but failed to understand the principles involved.  This allowed them to not extend improvements to other areas of their processes.  This has been mimiced in business by all the failed initiatives that litter the highway, all good if you pay attention to their design, key assumptions, and core principles.<br />I though the book was well written, to the point, well illustrated with examples, all expressing key truths (though not new, well done).  You can find other books that take each aspect (check the chapters) and dive deep into theory, but if you want a practitioners guide to how to get it done, this is a great book.	2003-03-31

There are books on the market that are more detailed in specific topics such as active listening, but as an overall practical guide to improving social effectiveness through starting and maintaining conversations, this is excellent.<br />The key to good converstation, per the author, is asking open ended questions that focus on the other person.  Be actively engaged in the conversation through active listening.<br />The book also goes into how deliver honest positives, even when that is difficult.  You could call this &quot;spin&quot;, but it is spin in the more positive sense, as opposed to what some politicians have performed.<br />The book also deals with how to communicate personal information to maintain and develop the conversation, use of body language, active listening, issuing invitation (conversations and other), handling criticism, defusing difficult situations, and requesting change of behaviors in others.<br />As I said, the book is well written, covers each subject well, with plenty of useful examples.  If you liked Covey's &quot;Seven Habits&quot;, you'll like this book.  I plan to make use of many of the techniques.	2003-03-29

The Question Behind the Question: Practicing Personal Accountability in business and in Life	Books	4	5	6	N	Y	Reviews Paid Off	...This book is not a heavy read. Finished it in an hour and a half on plane with a meal.  It heavily uses annecdotes to make it point.  The gist of what it talks about is how you frame your question impacts your outcome.  Many people frame their questions in the first person (I or me)and in the reference of victimhood, e.g. &quot;Why does (fill in the blank) happen to me?&quot;<br />Through the annecdotes, the author tries to teach you to frame questions that empower people to take charge and responsibility for their actions and situations.<br />This is a good book for managers and subordinates.	2003-01-20

I have completed course work for a black belt and need to complete the project.  This is just to provide a basic reference for my comments. (Update: 7 years lean & 6 sigma black belt)    The book is good and technically accurate.  It is written by a consultancy, with a not totally overt message to hire them.  They do not go in to the detailed nuts and bolts of 6 sigma or lean. If that is what you want, look elsewhere.  They do discuss both, with more on lean than six sigma.  Heavy emphasis on change management and leadership involvement (as it should be).    They have their angle on approach, which seems the case with most consultants (everyone has their flavor), but it is not out of line with the orthodoxy of either discipline.    The best benefit is how they integrate both disciplines.  This integration was not an overt display with in the book, and that maybe intentional.  There is a line of thinking that Lean and 6 Sigma are two sides of the same coin, or a ying and yang to continuous improvement.  The authors seem to go down this road.  They take a project management approach, and in project definition try to decide if this is a 6 sigma or lean project.  It wasn't crystal clear what they do if it is blended.  My take away is that you blend your approach.  This may mean spin-off projects from the main project or a longer total duration as you work through the lean and 6 sigma issues.    It is worth getting and reading.  The DFSS (Design for Six Sigma) is better done elsewhere.  Lean sigma is relatively new, so expect more books on different approaches.  I like the integrated approach, pick the dominant theme and use those tools.  Address issues as they come up.  Move the ball.  I like what one instructor told me about both.... \\"I can do Lean without 6 sigma, but not 6 sigma without Lean.\\"  By that he meant there are tools in Lean that only help clear the clutter for 6 sigma, like 5-s & standard work (work place organization and housekeeping).	2002-12-30
US	52572139	R17ET09N4SD7IE	0873892968	304576422	Business Process Benchmarking (The Asqc Total Quality Management)	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Sound, Solid, Thorough	Robert Camp writes as an engineer to an engineer.  The detail, thoroughness, and organization is first rate.  The topic is very, very useful.  The perspective he takes in this book how do you manage the benchmarking process within your organization.  There is detail on how to benchmark, though he refers to his first book if you need more on that topic.  This book is excellent for the process of managing benchmarking and setting up the organization to provide a sustained and effective benchmarking effort.  There are plenty of tools and examples in the text and in the appendices.<br />Be prepared for a more &quot;text book&quot; approach to writing than that of other business books.  I got thtought he book, but at times it was on determination not exciting writing style.	2002-11-03

As you will see in other reviews, the book tended towards generalities.  It's key ideas are excellent, but not new.  The linkage bewteen vision, strategy, and operational plans is well done.  There are a lot of annecdotes, and some numbers and examples.  The book tends to stay in the rarified air of CEO strategy.  The book draws heavily from the GE experience and on information in Welch's books.<br />I also saw strong parallels to the topics discussed in the Malcolm Baldrige criteria (linkage, strategy, plans, resources) and systems thinking (Peter Senge, The Fifth Discipline).<br />I think this is good as an introductory book and in providing context, then move on to other books for the meat of the subject.	2002-11-02

It covers all of the basics and enough detail to present a sound and solid beginning to anyone looking to understand Lean and Kaizen.

The book is detailed in explaining the philosophy and its underpinnings.  It is short on mathematical proofs, but there are detailed references where you can find that kind of information should you choose to.<br />There are tons of examples of why conventional management wisdom is terribly flawed, why &quot;Quality Control&quot; of the lot inspection sort is wasteful, and how you can fix it all.  Just don't be in the market for &quot;Instant Pudding&quot;.<br />The explanation of the philosophy is straight forward and fairly simple.  The 14 points are explained as is &quot;operational definitions&quot; and system tampering.<br />I especially like the funnel experiments and how it relates to machine/process operations.	2001-01-11
