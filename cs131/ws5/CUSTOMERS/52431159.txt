Imagine how pleasantly surprised I was to find that Margaret Edwards was a dynamic, funny writer whose issues in the sixties regarding the state of young adult services has numerous parallels in today's world of teen services!  While the text is certainly dated in terms of language and the books discussed, the refreshing attitude of Edwards can still be seen in many public libraries all over the country.  This is a great read, intrinsically and historically, and I think many librarians will say, &quot;How little has changed!&quot;  Let's hope we all work to further the work that Edwards began.	2003-02-01

Strong has written an excellent account of the inherent flaws of prenatal care in the United States, highlighting where Western medicine succeeds and where it fails.  Looking critically at other health care systems around the world, he demonstrates how alternative health care for birth when delivered by midwives has higher success rates in preventing premature birth and various birth problems.  If anything prevented me from giving this excellent work five stars, it was the fact that Dr. Strong, while praising health care systems like the Netherlands, decided not to address the fact that those same praiseworthy birth traditions are delivered by lay midwives, not the nurse-midwives found in other countries.  While both lay (or direct-entry) midwives and nurse-midwives contribute important care to pregnant women, Dr. Strong failed to address the prejudices surrounding direct-entry midwifery in the United States despite its affordability and accessibility in remote areas.<br />I think this is an important book for mothers to read, but be aware that it presents research and, while well-written, is not written in the accessible format of many books destined for the expectant parent.  It would be an excellent book for anyone interested in the sociology or medical anthropology of birth and its inclusion in women's studies classes would enrich any curriculum.	2003-01-20

Covering all aspects of prenatal care, birth, and postnatal care, this is an excellent work for both professional and expectant parent.  Expectant parents should be aware, however, that Davis responsibly addresses the many possible complications of birth from a professional standpoint - information that might inform one future parent while alarming another - so parents should use their self-knowledge to determine whether they wish to read those parts.<br />This work would also be invaluable for the professional midwife interested in mentoring students or for the future midwife wanting an overview of midwifery practice and information on entering the profession.  Extensive resources and bibliographies are presented.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-20

Boyden of Deerfield	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Insightful into Deerfield's school culture	McPhee has written a highly readable account of the impact of a single individual on one of New England's important boarding schools.  This work is particularly interesting when juxtaposed against similar works on the history of Groton School, St. Paul's School, or Exeter/Andover when viewing how one person can cause an entire school culture to take root.  Found most often in schools where strong headmasters have either founded the school or contributed a life of service, Deerfield Academy comes across in McPhee's work as the true child of Boyden whose various quirks in no way detracted from his personal mission of making a difference in boys' lives.  While by no means a critical work, &quot;Headmaster&quot; is nevertheless an important document in understanding the history of an important boarding school.	2003-01-20

So many books on interpersonal relationships among children now center on the topic of teenage sexuality but many behavior patterns of power and control begin much earlier in the pre-teen years.  \\"Odd Girl Out\\" concentrates on the power dynamics of young girls (pre-puberty) and how a lack of vigilance among educators and parents can amplify or worsen girl bullying.<br />Since I work among teenagers, I immediately realized the importance of reading this book - the types of behavior Simmons describes in young girls continues to be played out among teen girls (i.e., making outsiders \\"pariahs\\" or spreading rumors continue to be ways of asserting power and controlling behavior).  If schools and parents could begin talking about this behavior when girls are young, children could learn to change their behavior and make responsible decisions about peer relationships later in life.<br />\\"Odd Girl Out\\" is well-written, filled with examples (and be warned that many will give you flashbacks to your own childhood), and offers excellent suggestions for managing this behavior among bullies and their victims.  Several valuable resources are referred to for thos interested.  Highly recommended.	2003-01-19

This joint effort between organization guru Julie Morgenstern and her daughter, Jessi, is really a valuable read for teens.  So many teenage boys and girls feel like their life is out of control and for many of them this manifests itself in the feeling that they can't find things, they don't have enough time in the day, that \\"stuff\\" is taking over.  \\"Organizing from the Inside Out for Teenagers\\" accomplishes what the adult version does - it takes you through steps in order to evaluate what's important in your life and then helps you develop a system that works for you (giving you some non-binding advice about what has often worked for other people).<br />I think my only criticism of this book is that it really assumes that readers come from comfortable economic backgrounds where parents with ready cash can go out and buy containers or certain items to help teens organize themselves.  While I'm sure any parent with the money will cheerfully buy anything their teen feels will help organize them, many young men and women do not have the financial means to accomplish these goals and will have to stick to the less expensive suggestions.  Overall though, an excellent book that will have positive impact in multiple areas of your life should you implement the suggestions and get control over your stuff rather than it having control over you.	2003-01-19

I was delighted to find Shary's book not only to be well-written, but filled with insight and a pervasive gentle humor.  The author successfully shows how film images of teenagers reflect pervasive social and political trends and often better depict adult fears of teenage behaviors rather than a realistic sense of actual teen culture.  I found his dividing up the hundreds of films he describes into subgenres (like movies about school culture, slasher films, movies about love and sex) to be extremely helpful in placing the films in their larger context as well as to see how some concepts evolve while other archetypes appear to be repeated again and again.<br />As a librarian and teen educator, I felt that this work had a lot of value.  With the emphasis on media literacy and critical thinking skills in education today, teachers and librarians need to be thinking about appealing ways of presenting information that will engage students into critically examining their culture.  Using popular films that star teen characters and/or teen culture would be a good way to accomplish this goal, and Dr. Shary's book would be an excellent and accessible text to use as both a model and as background knowledge in this type of class.  Because of the prevalence of cable television in the lives of teens, even the older movies from the 80s are likely to be relatively familiar and useful for discussions about historical trends and changes.<br />Dr. Shary should be complemented on this excellent, academic work on the image of youth in contemporary film.  All college and high school libraries would be recommended to have a copy on hand and use it as a guide for collecting some key films of high quality for their visual collections.	2002-12-03

I am thankful this husband and wife team decided to update their work as it was needed.  The old book was written in an age when fewer people had access to good quality natural food stores with their now common staples of herbal and homeopathic remedies.  Reflecting recent research, and continuing the constant educational crusade of alerting the human companions of dogs and cats to the truth about pet food, the Pitcairns continue to offer alternatives to highly-processed, poor-quality food that literally kills (or drastically shortens the life) of our beloved dogs and cats.<br />Like many of the reviewers for this book, I could regale you with real-life stories of my previously unhealthy pets (adopted through animal shelters or rescue societies) who were changed by altering their diets, much to the astonishment of their veternarians.  I would rather alert you to the fact that, as with everyone, what an animal eats is crucial to its health and two of my wonderful animal companions (a cat given up for a allergic (human's that is) reaction and a dog with chronic skin problems with big vet bills attached) would not have been given up had their previous owners spent approximately 8 dollars more a month on either a higher quality food or fresh food easily made into a raw-foods diet.  For anyone with cats interested in exploring their animal's health in depth (or who are endangered of needing to give up a cat due to a family members allergic reaction), I would also strongly encourage you to buy Anitra Frazier's The New Natural Cat.	2002-06-27

Her prose is readable; her scholarship exhaustive and convincing.  Every married woman or mother (and often those who are both) has said to herself, &quot;There's something not fair here, I just can't put my finger on it.&quot;  Well, Crittenden puts her finger on it!  Corporate attitudes (from often &quot;family friendly&quot; companies), taxes, divorce law, and rotten child care all enter her gun sight as she explains the current situation, how we got here, and what we need to do TO MAKE IT FAIR.  The answers are like the problems: complex and difficult to implement.  That does not mean, however, that the solutions aren't worth attempting - they are.<br />I especially enjoyed the author's analysis of countries like Sweden and France and how they have handled issues surrounding parenting and work.  The most interesting factor was the description from the member of Sweden's &quot;Father Commission&quot; as to why Sweden adopted such liberal and finanically supportive policy for parents.  It seems that at the time of widesweeping legislation offering financial support to new parents, Sweden was undergoing a shortage of labor.  Rather than relying on the importation of labor, Sweden realized its greatest resource were Swedish women who faced obstacles to working when their children were young - unreliable child care, no guaranteed job when they returned to work, lack of flex time, etc.  Sweden's government decided to remove the obstacles, jack up financial support, offer great child care, and put in place crucial legislation encouraging parents (read &quot;men and women&quot;) to spend time with their kids.  Result: happier women, men who know what its like to be a parent and get support at work for doing it, and happy babies living in a profitable economy.  Go Sweden!<br />If there are any drawbacks to The Price of Motherhood, it's thatCrittenden has spent so much time with the topic (both researching it and personally experiencing it) that her bitterness occasionally seeps through in prose.  I think her arguments might have been stronger in some instances if she had managed to root out the sarcasm or the repeated &quot;It's not fair...&quot;.  But she's right.  It isn't fair.

Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A must-read for educators	In the many first-person accounts detailed in this story, I was amazed to see the recurring theme of apathy on the part of the schools to the labeling of young women as \\"sluts\\".  While a principal or teacher in a large school cannot be asked to know every rumor bandied about the cafeteria, the majority of stories included widespread vandalism detailing sexually harassing statements in addition to actual catcalls and statements made during class time and in the presence of a teacher.<br />So where were the educators?  Not only is the behavior against the law (bravo to the chapter entitled \\"Afterword\\" and Appendix A for detailing action to be taken and an example of a positive school reaction to such a situation) but it could never be construed as a positive learning environment.  How could a teacher or administrator feel that this behavior was acceptable?  Tanenbaum's answer would probably be centered around the innate, ingrained nature of our society's habit of labeling good girls/bad girls with all the emotional baggage that this process entails.  The principals and teachers involved in these painful incidents had one thing in common - they went through a school system at some point in their life and probably engaged in or witnessed this type of harassment.  We must all remember - silence is consent.  Would you want your daughter to go through this?	2002-05-20

While some of the advice was excellent (I now have several additions to my &quot;must read&quot; list), I disagreed heartily with some of their reviews and was dismayed to find inaccuracies (like putting &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; in the Mother/Daughter relationship chapter while stating that Meggie and her mother both loved Father Ralph - it was her Aunt who was hot for him!!!).<br />I think this book might be better in small doses so as not to overload on the &quot;attitude&quot;.

Other reviews have labeled the work &quot;history lite&quot; and I do see what they mean - very little time spent on Alexandra's views and influences politically (for which there exists substantial documentation as viewed in the Romanov classic &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot; by Robert K. Massie) - it would have taken up too much page space describing political climates and individual personalitites.  Nicholas also appears to be an intellectual lightweight with very little mind of his own.  While he was easily influenced, there exists a decent amount of material indicating Nicholas' frustrations with his wife and her often highly emotional views (see Massie).  However, Erickson should not be faulted for her excellent and highly readable prose.  Russia of this era truely comes alive and a real sense of Alexandra's world helps aid the reader in making decisions about her behavior.<br />Also contradicting a below review, I definitely feel that Erickson's book has brought out at least two major new contributions to the scholarly work about the Romanovs.  Namely, bringing to light the fixation of Nicholas and Alexandra with the French mystic, Phillippe Vachot, one time butcher then hypnotist and charlatan to the aristocracy.  Their reliance on his judgements and spiritual healing so early in their marriage and reign is incredibly predictive of their later dependency on Rasputin, down to their referring to Vachot as &quot;our friend&quot; in correspondance to one another.  The fact that Vachot stated prior to his death that he would be reincarnated in another man who would come to give them spiritual guidance, all but cemented the later easy acceptance of Rasputin.  The second of Erickson's contribution centers arounda more detailed account of Alexandra's ongoing health problems (someone with chronic leg pain is going to hate balls and receptions involving hours spent on her feet, regardless of her shyness) many of them mental in nature.  Also, how easily accepted drugs of their period (barbituates and cocaine) were used by both Nicholas and Alexandra as little was known of side effects by physicians of the time.  This drug use (which occurs right around WWI and the downfall of the monarchy) could only have greatly infuenced decisions made in a completely autocratic government.<br />An excellent work and one worthy of reading by any Russian scholar interested in the time period and Romanov dynasty.	2001-10-23

She has successfully integrated her own personal experience (as a journalist then as a scholarly writer) with that of her friends and enemies, the movers and shakers of the women's movement.  Her work is infinitely readable and having both a scholarly reflection of the sequence of events coupled with her emotional account is riveting.  <br />Two major things emerge from this book.  First, like most movements the women's movement was intensely grass-roots with all its heated emotions and disorganization.  Made up (with a few exceptions) of young women, initial efforts at organization suffered from awkward leadership and infighting.  Second, nevertheless, the issues women were fighting for struck such a chord across America that eventually the movement was comprised of women from all races and backgrounds - resulting in the successful passage of important legislation.<br />Brownmiller's book would be an excellent addition to a women's history collection - one warning though, there are a ton of names of movement leaders peppered throughout the book and someone new to the history might be confused initially.  A reading of a more scholarly book might be a good preface.  Thanks Susan for a super book!	2001-10-22

He has produced a book so densely packed with up to the minute references, detailed instructions for various obedience exercises, and managed to still lace throughout a profound love and respect of animals. Owning up to old, outdated, and cruel methods of training, Spector gives lots of credit to pioneers of clicking like Karen Pryor and has put an excellent bibliography within the book. If any criticism exists, it would be that some exercises are hard to picture (purchasing Peggy Tillman's &quot;Clicking with Step-by-Step Pictures&quot; would be a helpful adjunct) and also Spector has used precise scientific language which causes the reader to slow down during certain passages.

Deftly weaving the history of the &quot;prep&quot; school, he gives insight into the current attitudes and tremendous evolution of independent schools. Both the parent of future prep student as well as educators in the system benefit tremendously from this book. Powell does not paint an entirely rosy picture; he confronts issues of institutions unwilling to change, sometimes mediocre teaching, and the hairy issues surrounding the college application process. This insight is balanced by utterly devoted teachers and institutions, the benefits of the independent school environment (little to no violence, personal attention that public schools can often not afford, and teache rs and staff highly motivated to know students and expand their horizons). Powell nevertheless provides tremendous insight into the independent school system and paints a picture of hope for a system willing and able to change with people who wish to create the best environment for children.	2001-08-27

I have to say that I was more than a little confused by the less enthusiastic reviews - what book did they read?  Not only does Adam Pertman include a great deal of information not previously reviewed (his statistics are the latest available) but he also NEVER implies that anyone goes through the adoption process (child, birth parent, or adoptive parent) emotionally unscathed.  What he does contend is that greater access to information for all parties leads to better adjustment and more contented individuals, both with themselves and the adoption process in general.<br />The book is a comprehensive and successful undertaking.  Pertman manages to give historical perspective of both domestic and international adoption, review the evolution of legislation surrounding the adoption process and records availability, while offering a sound emotional basis for participants in the process.  (Pertman was adopted himself and has also adopted children with his wife, so he comes at it from many perspectives.  He also has interviewed numerous birth parents for the book, and has an open relationship with the birth parents of his children.)  I was flabbergasted again and again by the empathy for all parties this author displayed all the while presenting scads of information about each step of the adoption process for the reader.  He has an excellent list of resources at the back of the book.<br />This reader is truly a must-have for anyone considering adopting a child, considering giving up a child for adoption, interested in the legal aspects of adoption and record availablity, or interested in the history of adoption.	2001-05-28

I would like to point out that Dr. Schoen does have a very holistic approach to veterinary medicine, having succesfully utilized both traditional and alternative methods of treatment.  While other volumes exist on homeopathy, acupuncture, and herbal treatment for animals, this book might be useful in terms of how the author came to use those treatments and his ideas on how they make work in the bodies of our animal companions. <br />Also of interest for the reader is the author's intense self-reflection on the human history of attitudes towards animals throughout time.  I thought Dr. Schoen did an excellent job explaining the many paradigms that have existed throughout time (largely centering around human dominion over the animals, how many have believed they have no emotions in order to justify atrocities, etc.) and how we live with those schools of thought today in terms of our laws surrounding animals as well as the prominent methods of treatment of animals both in the home and on the farm.  His having to exhaustively fight/acquiese to dominant theory during his veterinary training and early practice is an interesting sociological anectdote.<br />This book is not only a well-written, feel good volume of one man's journey in life treating and living with animals, but also exists as a thought provoking volume questioning our societal attitudes towards animals.	2001-05-28

His insights into the college experience, ranging from living arrangements to coursework to volunteer experiences are drawn from hundreds of interviews with current and graduated Harvard students.  Although at first glance, the reader might want to make the assumption that Harvard students are different from the norm, quite the opposite is true.  Light's lecturing at various higher education institutions has come up with correlations from large state universities and small liberal arts colleges alike.<br />The main crux of the study isn't overly shocking - students need close contact with faculty and other students who will challenge their minds and engage their hearts.  Attention from others is the key correlating factor to having a successful and rewarding college experience.  Of particular interst are the chapters on diversity and on study skills; both might be of particular interest to high school educators in terms of equipping high school students with the personal and study skills necessary to succeed in college.	2001-05-12

The dogs are very similar to children - they call their owners &quot;pets&quot; and believe they shape the behavior of the people around them.  Pongo and Perdita also have an extensive network of dog informants (tapped into when they &quot;walk&quot; the owners).  This novel also struck me as an excellent introduction into British post-war life for children (I always thought it especially wonderful that the male owner was some type of British tax genius with lots of connections in the government).  While Cruella deVille is not quite as scary as the Disney character, children and adults everywhere can appreciate and identify her with people who see animals as only something to provide a service or product for them - not as creatures with emotions and thoughts of their own deserving of life.  A wonderful anti-fur demonstration is included in the climax of the novel.  All interested readers should be sure to pick up Smith's sequel as well!	2001-05-01

Women's history is a passionate topic of mine and I was interested to see how the author would tackle such a complicated issue as marriage throughout the ages.  Yalom was clearly up to the task!  Her prose is witty and smooth while her research bears up under close scrutiny.  Clearly such a mammoth undertaking as studying &quot;the wife&quot; in every society could not have been attempted in a mere 400 pages, so she does concentrate on Western society.  Nevertheless, her scope is enormous, beginning with pre-history and leading up to the late 1990s.  She does a marvelous job combining scholarly work with personal diaries and anecdotes, as well as the analysis of art and other cultural references.  <br />Two things struck me while reading it: 1) I never thought &quot;Well, this is getting a little dry&quot; and 2) Everything old is new again, since many of the struggles women have today are continual themes that have existed for hundreds of years.  I definitely appreciated her broadening the scope of &quot;wife&quot; to include other types of romantic partners in the last chapter during her analysis of the latter half of the twentieth century.  Yalom's &quot;History of the Breast&quot; is waiting in the wings for me to read.  I just wonder what's next - &quot;History of the Child&quot;?  &quot;History of the Daughter&quot;?

The ecumenical potluck has kosher suggestions but all the other menus are described in a kosher format (meat, pareve or dairy).  <br />Since my husband and I are vegetarian, I was looking for something beyond the more &quot;hippie&quot; resources available for Jewish vegetarian cooking and this book has more than exceeded my expectations.  (A note to others thinking of preparing some of the vegetarian dishes: Schulman does include chicken bouillon granules in some of her vegetarian recipes which would render the food NOT vegetarian by the majority of the veggie world - just use powdered vegetable soup granules instead.)  She also has an entire extra chapter of other passover recipes so you can switch or substitute to your heart's content.<br />I think this volume would be especially appreciated by the first-time Seder host/hostess as Schulman gives you a diagram of what your seder table should look like, the various seder plate items and their meaning, and an excellent reference for kosher wines and liquors (I would also recommend kosher.org as an additional resource).  This beautiful holiday will certainly be enhanced by anyone choosing to read and implement the suggestions of this book.	2001-03-26

Let's face it - what zaftig woman hasn't said to herself, &quot;My God, what DID they do before the bra?&quot;  Well, here's your answer.<br />The illustrations from various sources are top notch and of excellent quality with an emphasis on 19th and 20th century advertising.  Since support has changed according to fashion, the book naturally chronicles in detail the ebb and flow of various fads.  Suddenly women fainting at the drop of a hat no longer seems an affectation after reading an account of a 23 year old woman who died shortly after a ball - the autopsy revealed her ribs that overlapped one another from years of corset use had finally pierced her vital organs!  I did find Fontaine's text to occasionally be a little shallow, and was dismayed to see Tony Curtis refered to as the captain of a submarine in &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (it was Cary Grant).  Whenever I find a small error like that I can't help but wonder what other errors I'm missing.<br />For the costumer, the social historian or anyone interested in women's issues, the book is a wonderful read.	2001-03-26

In an approachable question and answer format, Basso outlines the most frequently asked questions about anatomy, relationships, contraception/STDs, and violence that he has experienced in his many years as a high school teacher.  Particularly wonderful are the informative and often funny illustrations peppered throughout the book.<br />I did find his weakest area to be the section on pregnancy and childbirth.  (Episiotomy is NOT necessary for birth and numerous studies throughout the world has shown it to be an unnecessary procedure).  I also took issue with his use of the word &quot;AIDS&quot; when most educators use &quot;HIV&quot; to describe this STD.  I think that many teens (and adults) would not be able to put this book down - I know I couldn't!	2001-03-07

Authoritative knowledge refers to the dominant accepted theory (usually the Western medical tradition and dependent on technology) and how its acceptance translates into customs and practices surrounding birth.<br />Many of the studies were very easy to read and the articles that &quot;told the tale&quot; of births in Greece, Mexico, and Sierra Leone were especially good.  A surprise for me was how much I enjoyed Marsden Wagner's article - a doctor and public health official by training, Wagner was appointed the head of the World Health Organization's Maternal and Child Health Department.  As he studied the efficacy of midwifery techniques the world over, Wagner began publishing WHO reports recommending the adoption of midwifery systems and a rejection of technology-oriented birth.  His story of how the Western medical community continually attempt to disparge and undermine his work (my words as his are more understanding of the difficulty of change) is an excellent overview of the power of medical professionals.	2001-03-05

While not an in-depth, sociological analysis of the concept of virginity, _The First Time_ instead focuses on the real experience of women as told in their own words.  Bouris does occasionally draw themes between stories and often brings in various feminist and gay perspectives of sexuality which enlighten the discourse.  I think this book would be extremely helpful to parents or young women as we can always learn from other people's mistakes (particularly from the women who mention a lack of facts and values from their parents or guardians).  This book would be an excellent read when combined with _The Sex Lives of Teenagers_ by Lynn Ponton.	2001-03-05

I cannot avoid commenting on this fabulous book, however! Diamant, who is known in the publishing world for her comprehensive and approachable books on Jewish life, has shown us an incredible and untapped side of her talent through this novel.<br />The story of Dinah (and of her &quot;mothers&quot;, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, the wives and concubines of Jacob) traverses childhood to womanhood to old age, from Canaan to Egypt and throughout it all, you live and breathe with these characters. Diamant has managed to do an astonishing amount of research for this book as she seamlessly weaves the daily life, religion, and natural world of the women into her prose.  Her accounts of Canaanite and Egyptian life appeared extremely accurate on all accounts, yet the book did not for one second ever seem dry or pedantic.  I read this work in one day to the exclusion of all else!	2001-02-26

Based on the premise that you will encounter brick walls in uncovering your ancestors, Croom attempts to give you ideas and strategies using proven techniques.  She assumes you have read the basic books (including her own).<br />Another unfortunate assumption is that she tailors her book for genealogists who are not utilizing one of the numerous software databases and therefore much of her text is spent with helpful hints about organizing your group family sheets and documents.  I actually found the numerous &quot;sleuth&quot; quotes from Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie to be very distracting (and I'm a huge mystery fan at that!).  Final thought, a good book for the non-computer using, intermediate genealogist.	2001-02-17

His research was clearly exhaustive and I found the first two-thirds of the book to be worthwhile but wordy.  The real gem of Moran's work is the last third of the book which deals with the 1950s to the present day.  It is very easy to chart our contemporary situation and approach to this topic by reading the history of the last few decades in particular.  Presenting the arguments of the pro and con sex education elements was very enlightening considering the ways in which the same arguments have been recycled again and again.  Most revelatory was the numerous evidence Moran presents showing that sex education in its current form neither increases or decreases age at first sexual experience or other risk behaviors unless the individual student in particularly future oriented.  A very worthwhile book and important for educators and parents.	2001-02-15

Her depication of life on the island, as well as the loving relationship between a girl and her dog, offer readers two good reasons to read this book.  Hyland tells the tale of Colleen and her dog, Skipper, while drawing the parallel story of a poor Irish boy, Patrick, who works on the SS Ethie.  I think many young boys and girls will be able to put themselves in the place of Colleen and Patrick and live this harrowing adventure to the fullest.  Since there is a happy ending for everyone, the story can be read by younger children (seven or eight) without fear of nightmares.	2001-02-11

Using Lewis' dog, Seaman, as a focal point, she details the many dangers and perils faced by the explorer group while doing good character development of the protagonists.  Sacagawea and York, a slave owned by Clark, are shown in their pivotal contributions (often ignored) to the expedition.  My only criticism revolves around the portrayal of the various Native American groups encountered by Lewis &amp; Clark.  Because she has drawn on the diaries and their viewpoint, various tribes are depicted as either &quot;noble savages&quot; or &quot;thieving Indians&quot; and deeper cultural issues are not explored as to the traditions of these varied groups.  Overall an excellent book, but perhaps best read with adult guidance.	2001-02-11

While the story is intensely emotional, Evans still manages to intersperse her personal experience with well-researched (the text is footnoted) commentary and reflection on the history of China's reproductive policy and the historical/cultural attitudes towards women.  She does an amazing job since many books and articles on China and its &quot;one-child&quot; policy tend to be either very &quot;pro&quot; or villify China's attempts to control population.  Evans presents a surprisingly complete picture with factual evidence of abuses of Chinese women via the government presented concurrently with empathetic views of the cultural legacy and how the current government policy is fighting thousands of years of sexist history.  <br />I think this book has appeal to both the adult considering adoption as well as anyone interested on the widescale implications of this complex situation in China.	2001-02-11

The bulk of the book centers around putting your forebears experiences in perspective through historical analysis of population trends and social life/everyday living thoroughout British history.  The last third of the book discusses research techniques and the documentation peculiar to the British Isles.

This is not your standard &quot;noble Newfie&quot; book from the perspective of humans.  Rather, the book is written largely from the point of view of the two dogs and their adventures in the wild.  Carr is an excellent observer of both nature and her dogs and the detailed text reflects this acuity. Her sketches of the dogs and other wildlife pepper the book and are overall very good.  My only criticism of this work is that is rather long and I found several typographical errors.  I think it would have great appeal for anyone interested in dog behavior or Southwestern nature.	2001-02-11

I agree with the other reviewer that it is certainly a real &quot;tearjerker&quot; but in a wonderful &quot;power of miracles&quot; way.

Differences abound, however, in Harlow's additions of relationship complexities and her drawing class and cultural tensions between various groups of islanders.  The book reveals a great deal about life for fishermen on the island of Newfoundland and of the immigrant Irish culture.  The book would probably be meant for a slightly older audience than &quot;Wreck of the Ethie&quot; because of the various group tensions, but I actually feel the this book does not do as good a job depicting the shipwreck (perhaps because the point of view is solely from the shore rescuers whereas the &quot;Ethie&quot; offers both points of view).  Excellent cover art and good prose.	2001-02-11

The kids in the class LOVED it and even my chronic fidgeters were riveted by the pictures and text.

Presenting a range of often likeable characters, Dr. Ponton does an excellent job of showing the intelligence and resilience of her patients while at the same time demonstrating how parents can feel angry and confused about how to parent their teen.  The book illustrates all the main issues surrounding adolescents, eating disorders, drugs/alcohol, sex, and abuse, as well as analyzing the complexity of mother/son, mother/daughter, father/son, and father/daughter relationships.<br />If I had to offer one criticism of this book, it would be that Dr. Ponton's language (particularly at the beginning of the book) tends to be extremely clinical and often presents a layer to wade through to find her point.  Although we live in the era of the pseudo-psychological talk show, and some of the language will be familiar, parents and teens seeking answers to a problem may find this quality of the book off-putting.  Conversely, I think this book would be of intense interest for other therapists who are interested in seeing various past and current adolescent theory put into practice by a skilled practioner.  The stories of the teens and their families are compelling to all audiences, however, and I cautiously recommend this book to a large audience.	2001-02-07

The contributors are thoughtful, often in emotional pain, honest about their experiences, and each one is a talented writer.  <br />The one thing that did emerge most clearly from this work was the overall tone that adoption was an incredibly painful thing for all parties involved.  The more positive essays were from the adoptive moms - birth moms and adopted daughters were obviously struggling to make sense out of their experiences.  I suspect that there are numerous people on all sides of the fence with incredibly positive adoption stories, but pain often prompts us to find an outlet and for many women, writing is the answer.  I do not regret for a moment reading this wonderful collection, but at the same time I seriously wonder whether adoption is something I'm able to emotionally tackle after experiencing Wadia-Ells' book.	2001-02-07

I can't imagine the difficulties she encountered in keeping her pact of not giving unsolicited advice as the teens recounted the poor choices they made or the threats of violence they encountered.  I found her work to be excellent for anyone interested in either a middle school or high school experience, particularly in a large public school system.  Even from the adolescent perspective, it was easy to see how both teens and teachers became victims of the system in which they participated.<br />One warning: you will get very caught up in the lives of these troubled and not-so-troubled individuals.	2001-02-05

The sections on 18th and 19th century realities for young men and women was particularly interesting.  I do wish that Hine would have footnoted his sources, as many historical and psychological assertions are made without the reader being entirely sure as to the origin of the material.<br />My biggest concern about the book is that I was unable to see, after careful reading, where the &quot;rise and fall&quot; actually was.  Despite societal changes and historical trends, it appeared to me that teenagers have simply risen (or fallen depending on your perspective) and there has in actuality been little fluctuation at least within the 20th century in the degree of their powerlessness.  Hine's writing becomes a tad more flamboyant when speaking of the 60s (as he confesses this was his own coming-of-age period) and there is very little contemporary information for the 1980s onward.  This book would probably be more helpful for the researcher looking for information on the 1800s and early 1900s, but would not lend itself to someone looking for insight into adolescent culture of the last 25 years.	2001-02-02

I had never read Jane Vella before!  A Maryknoll sister and longtime worker for Save the Children, Vella has taught in 48 countries and for over 45 years doing community development work in incredibly varied and diverse situations.  You don't have to be interested in community development though, to get the point of this book.  While her stories are riveting (you constantly grip the book asking, &quot;And then what happened?!&quot;), her message is consistent - she maps out how she plans, teaches, listens, and reflects on all her teaching/learning experiences.  I particularly appreciated her honest approach (she tells you stories of when things didn't go well) and her egalitarian approach to equalizing power in the classroom (she calls it &quot;the death of the professor&quot;).  This would also be an excellent volume for anyone working with a culture not their own - Vella models how to truly listen to people's needs in their education experience and not impose what you think they need.	2001-01-31

Of particular interest are the letters on illness and aging as well as friendship.  I'm particularly glad she included passionate love between women, but find other aspects of diversity sadly missing.  She does include some letters from Islamic women, but other cultures are sadly excluded (my suspicion is that this is from lack of ready resources at Kenyon's disposal rather than a conscious decision on her part).  Some of the letters are enthralling, other's somewhat boring, and therefore similar to what you might uncover in your family's attic.  This book is definitely worth the read, but I'm uncertain as to whether it's worth a purchase.	2001-01-29

It certainly would have been stronger writing if the authors had left their personal interpretations out of the text and let the facts speak for themselves, because the facts are just that - proof of a tremendous bias in society that continually affects women's health on a day to day basis.<br />Having used this book as a textbook in a college course on women's health, I found it to be an excellent source when combined with other books and articles, usually those concentrating on the history of a given issue.  The history aspect is crucial - and by concentrating on scientists and government statistics for their work, Laurence and Weinhouse often leave the reader bewildered as to how our society got to a place where women's health is ignored or endangered by cultural attitudes.  This book helps get women angry at their treatment by the medical profession and that often is the first step to understanding and exploring other issues in women's studies.  My thanks to the authors.	2001-01-27

Each article is a jewel offering a glimpse into a world not often revealed - women experiencing the changing attitudes of a society that often did not offer them the choices they deserved.

As a vegetarian, this book was of little use to me in the kitchen (three-quarters of the recipes are meat based) but if I did eat meat, some of the stews would probably be delicious and easily adapted to a crockpot!  The real strength of this book comes from the meticulous scholarship of the authors who give a fascinating glimpse into the lives of conversos (Jews living as Christians for survival).  In many of the stories (and a little vignette accompanies each recipe),  jealous neighbors or suspicious gentile servants reveal the outcomes of their spying on their neighbors (my favorite being the servant who noted that her mistress must definitely be a Jew since she uncomplainingly leapt into bed with her husband on Friday night in contrast to all the other days of the week!).  Gitlitz and Davidson pain an excellent picture of medieval life in close quarters and successfully transmit the constant stress and tension in the lives of these individuals trying to straddle two worlds.	2000-10-11

The use of tofu is effortless and inspired unlike  many vegetarian cookbooks that struggle with making it into a &quot;meat  analog&quot;.

She lucidly recreates the social norms and complex personal lives of Austen  and her family (and with all the name-changing of brothers and uncles in  order to receive inheritances, this is no small feat!).  I loved how  Tomalin draws parallels between events and places in Austen's life and her  various works; she obviously has an intimate knowledge of literary theory.   Yet Tomalin does not fall into the mistake of trying to render Austen's  books autobiographical - she clearly states what Austen experienced and  what was fiction.  You practically weep at the destruction of all the  correspondance (and Jane Austen was a prolific letter writer in her  lifetime) by family members - so few letters survive to give us insight  into this intriguing character.  Thank goodness Tomalin is able to write  such an excellent biography despite this lack of primary material.	2000-07-22

Uris has written a saga of the intertwined histories of two families, one of  Catholic subsistence farmers and the other wealthy Protestant  industrialists, during the political turmoil of the late 19th century.

While both take place in humankind's prehistory, I'm afraid I found little else in common.   Particularly disturbing was the widespread misogyny and violence against  women portrayed as part of the culture of the humans at the time.  I also  found the author's often excessive descriptive sytle distracting at times -  a little more simplicity would have been appreciated.  The main character,  Torka, was difficult for me to connect with and I felt his character  development to be abrupt and without explanation.

Tying the development of philosophical beliefs and life events to her literature, Elbert  demonstrates the role of Alcott's intense committment to abolition and  women's rights in her work.  She conducts particular in depth analyses of  several of Alcott's &quot;adult&quot; novels as well as the March family  series (Little Women, Little Men, Jo's Boys).  I was especially interested  in the family conflict Alcott felt between her domestic obligations of  supporting and caring for her mother and father and her dedication to her  career.

Practically half the book is devoted to a meticulous charting of Madeleine's parents, the Korbels, and their narrow escape from the  Holocaust and later the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia.  Following  them to America, Dobbs shows how Madeliene's drive and natural intelligence  lead her to assimilate seamlessly into American culture and graduate from  Wellesley College.  I think the author also does an excellent job charting  the conflicts for women of this period and demonstrates how Albright  succeeds in constantly acquiring new skills and a network of influential  friends and colleagues during a time when she could have been simply a  &quot;supportive housewife&quot;.  His insider look at her political career  in New York and Washington is fascinating and very informative.<br />Perhaps  Dobbs deserves to be best congratulated on developing a three-dimensional  picture of a complex woman - no saint but instead a powerful human figure  in our time.	2000-07-14

A complex person, she balanced both passion and intellectual pursuits in an era when just daily  life and survival could be all-consuming.  I think it is important,  however, to separate the wonder of this subject from the actual book  itself, the first half of which I found less than smoothly written or easy  to follow.  Bober's documentation naturally stems from the wealth of  letters and diaries of the main figures but I often felt like I wasn't  getting the full story through her editing.  Her use of  &quot;dramatization&quot; of events and scenes can be excused since the  audience is a young readership, but it was a little disconcerting.   Nevertheless, she has produced a good book (particularly the sections on  Adam's vice-presidency and presidency).	2000-07-14

I was pleasantly  surprised, then, to find Newberger's approach to the subject of the male  character both thorough and non-sensationalist.  Beginning with infancy,  the author does a wonderful job charting the development of character in  boys (although much of the information can be applied to girls as well -  the language is far from exclusionary).  Newberger also possesses a  supportive attitude toward parents and charts the familial and societal  pressures faced by them while illustrating how this affects parenting  ability and skill.  Rather than definite stages, the book is divided into  topics like &quot;curiosity&quot;, &quot;teasing and bullying&quot;, and  &quot;play and sports&quot;.  The result is like a well-done essay series  but without the repetition or wandering that often accompanies that type of  volume.  The best thing about this book is Newberger, though; his loving  and supportive attitude toward children and their parents envelops you  while not being cloying or patronizing.  He is a wonderful resource and  advocate for boys, and girls, of all ages.	2000-07-08

The appendix also has wonderful forms you can use  for keeping track of who gives you what when, since after reading this  book, you will inevitably be checking your bill with a magnifying glass  (and finding numerous mistakes, as 98.5% of all hospital bills contain  them, according to the author).  Since this book is endorsed by the  People's Medical Society, a non-profit consumer organization that I think  has ties to the Rodale Foundation, it's nice to know that the revisions of  this volume have input from previous readers sharing their experiences (and  how the book helped them in their own hospital experience).

From women's rights to labor issues,  Chicago corruption to pacificism, the author glides easily from social  issue to personal insight.  Jane emerges as a real individual, not an  &quot;angel&quot;, but someone to be greatly admired.	2000-07-06

Most enlightening (and frightening) was the chapter  dedicated to infection control issues - it's amazing how often overworked  hospital staff ignore basic hygiene and universal precautions in an effort  to get all their work done.  The authors give examples of lots of good  questions to ask (and direct you to the risk management department of the  hospital - not the public relations office).  The book also breaks down the  hospital bureaucracy so I came away with an excellent understanding of how  all the parts of this large &quot;machine&quot; interact with one another.   Blau and Shimberg have devoted a good amount of space to the issues of  patient rights and insurance concerns which will probably affect anyone  having to deal with the paperwork aftermath of a hospital stay.  Peppered  with anecdotes (some funny, some scary), this book is an excellent resource  and should be recommended reading for anyone evaluating such a facility.	2000-07-05

Each woman relating her harrowing/funny/poignant experience of birth has her own voice and style.   What was amazing was how different each birth experience was for each woman  (and not just regarding the setting that it happened) but at the same time  how similar their experience was in terms of it being a life-transforming  event.  I felt her inclusion of experiences of multiple births and of  infant loss to be a choice that really rounded out this book.	2000-07-04

Very up to date in terms of medication information and surgery, the  authors also do an excellent job of describing the symptoms of inflammatory  bowel disease and WHY you are feeling this way (something I've yet to come  across in any other book on IBD).  I was disappointed in the primitive line  drawings used to illustrate the book and in the negative attitude toward  some alternative medical treatments discussed in the &quot;mind/body&quot;  chapter (although I was pleased to see its inclusion).  The authors should  be commended for approaching the emotional aspects of IBD in a forthright  manner and the book would be an appropriate addition to any IBD library.	2000-07-04

Individuals  with IBD consciously choosing the surgery often have a more positive  attitude and suffer fewer emotional downswings because of the overall  improvement in their post-surgery life.  Phillips includes the usual  chapters related to family members and their coping issues, which is very  helpful, but the overall lack of first person accounts, and the slightly  outdated information make The Ostomy Book the preferred book on this topic.   Still, this volume would be useful if the new ostomate or a family member  is having difficulty adjusting.	2000-07-01

I'm a big proponent of first person accounts with living with an ostomy and this book is one big anecdote from both ostomates and ET nurses.  It is so full of information that I'm going  to read it through a couple times for all the information it has to offer.  Although this is meant to be a resource for traveling, I actually found the  details of people discussing how they normally care for their ostomies and  then how they change their care for traveling to be very enlightening and  to contain lots of information not found in the traditional IBD and ostomy  books.  Perhaps the greatest benefit though, was being inspired by the  various individuals who have not let their ostomy slow them down in the  least and who lead active lives that should be the envy of non-ostomates!

With a psychiatry background, he worked in a free clinic in New Orleans in the 1960s with &quot;flower children&quot; who introduced him to then  &quot;alternative&quot; concepts like yoga, meditation, and vegetarianism.   With these interests more and more compelling, he decided to travel to  India and began training in homeopathy and Ayurveda.  He set up practicing  these newfound skills in Chicago and became so successful that he founded  six clinics around the city.<br />While the unifying concepts to Ballentine's  approach are unarguable - self-awareness, transformation, and wholeness - I  found myself rather disturbed by the absence of a few things in this book.   Namely, the author is so pro-alternative medicine that he doesn't even pay  Western medicine the lip service it's due; namely, that its strength is  crisis medicine and intervention.  On a similar vein, on the chapter on  herbal traditions, my hackles rose with the author's claim that the reader,  upon completion of the section, would be able to walk into any health food  store and select a &quot;medicinal&quot;.  This without the usual  disclaimers of working with a reputable practitioner, be aware of  interactions if you are currently taking other medication, etc.  <br />With  that in mind, I found Ballentine's knowledge of homeopathy to be truly  comprehensive and one of the best historical discussions and practical  applications I've found to date in any book.  Other stand out chapters  include the exercise and movement chapter as well as the &quot;Healing as  Transformation&quot; chapter which concentrates on breathwork and chakras -  very well written and good advice for everyone.  The resources at the end  of the book are comprehensive, but I still wish that, considering the fine  job explaining the complexities of various alternative/complementary  traditions, that the author would have spent more time discussing how to  selecta reputable practitioner to accompany the individual on their  journey.  Still a recommended purchase for an alternative medicine library.	2000-06-30

She was overwhelmed by the response of other women in  similar situations and by the universality of their experience.  Gathering  the narratives of many women with chronic illness, she compiled this  comprehensive and extremely moving book.  Much of the narratives involve  issues surrounding &quot;invisible&quot; illness.  While some of the book  refers to specific details of the British medical system, American readers  will definitely identify with the types of hurdles to effective treatment  faced by these women.<br />I was particularly interested in the chapter  &quot;Feeling Useful: Work, Roles, and Contributing to Society&quot; and  found Marris' issue of the main definition of &quot;normality&quot; in our  culture is our work from which we derive status, identity, income, and  social contact.  When chronic illness enters the picture, women often end  up in dangerous situations.  Financially, women lose out in general since  they make less money than men for the same work, and spend less time in the  workforce (if they take time off to care for a family) and therefore earn  less towards retirement.  Experiencing a chronic illness or disability  results in a group of people at high risk for long-term poverty.  This is  not a &quot;how-to&quot; or self-help book in the truest sense of the word,  but anyone who might gain strength or insight into other experiences of  chronic illness might enjoy reading it.  I know I gained much insight into  my own experience.	2000-06-30

Using the primary idea that &quot;Attention has power&quot;, Dr. Chopra asks us to begin using our  power by bringing our attention to key issues in our lives - both physical  and mental - in order to tap into our natural boundless energy.  Although  the author touches on the issue of chronic fatigue syndrome, this book is  not for individuals suffering from that illness (although many of the  principles would certainly benefit them) but rather is for the person  without a specific diagnosed condition who remembers fondly a time when  they had enough energy to tackle their day and not have to nap on the couch  before dinner!  <br />The reader begins with an overview of issues surrounding  fatigue in our modern world and then takes a dosha quiz to determine their  &quot;type&quot; according to Ayurvedic medicine.  Having read several  books on the subject of the Ayurvedic philosophy, I have to say that this  was the best quiz to determine dosha I have seen thus far.  Subsequent  chapters have various recommendations for specific doshas when applicable.   Dr. Chopra centers his text on several &quot;Primary Energy  Principles&quot; which are statements emphasizing the connection of the  body/mind and the fact that we derive our energy from the abundant energy  resources of nature; lack of energy indicates an imbalance or block in this  flow.<br />As with any Ayurvedic resource, the recommendations for overcoming  fatigue are incredibly holistic.  Beginning with key principles surrounding  diet (by dosha) and good digestion, Dr. Chopra also encompasses issues of  stress reduction (using breathing meditation, yoga postures, alternate  nostril breathing exercises, and self-massage), tapping into the natural  rhythms of the day (principles of good sleep, limiting high-focus or  stimulating activities after dinner and before bed, getting fresh air and  sunshine, getting exercise with recommendations by dosha), and paying  attention not only to the health of the physical environment surrounding  you but also of your mental and spiritual well-being.  I found this last  chapter to be particularly profound as I know many people who take to heart  a &quot;fitness plan&quot; and never stop to examine why they do not  experience passion or joy in their personal pursuits; they have stopped  growing as people and the stagnation affects their bodies in profound ways  despite their surface &quot;care&quot; of it.<br />If fatigue is an issue for  you (is it not an issue for anyone?), this book is a recommended purchase  as you will refer to it again and again as you seek to regain health and  vitality in your everyday life.	2000-06-30

Once again endorsed by the CCFA (an indicator of quality), this book is extremely well written and  definitely the best laid out book on the market.  It's always been a pet  peeve of mine that IBD books never seem to have any good pictures or  illustrations and this book has a plethora of both.  The information is  still your standard IBD stuff - overview of the diseases, medical/surgical  treatment, emotional issues, IBD in children, in pregnancy, etc. - but it  is easy to read and very accessible in attitude.

The author is quite candid in her personal experience with chronic illness and the resources at the end  of the book are excellent and not the usual &quot;run of the mill&quot;.  I  love her quote about the importance of first person narratives. &quot;For  those of us who are ill, chronic illness sets us apart.  But when we read  about the experiences of others, we realize we are not alone and that  healing is available to all of us, regardless of our disease.&quot;<br />While Wells includes the usual information about good doctor/patient  relationships and the importance of spirituality and alternative methods of  healing, her real strength lies in her incredible ability to get the  emotional heart of the various aspects of being chronically ill.  I found  her chapter &quot;From Denial to Acceptance and Back Again&quot; to be  amazing in its clear articulation of the emotional stages of chronic  illness and the profound isolation that can result from that experience.  Everyone with a chronic illness should read and keep this book in their  personal health library.	2000-06-30

She outlines numerous diets for different IBD situations and  has many recipes available (pretty much the bulk of the book).  My  criticism centers around two points: 1) for me as a vegetarian, many of the  diets were inaccessible due to their reliance on meat (a common occurrence  in IBD books since meat is very low-residue) and 2) the recipes are very  hard to read since she has detailed metric and standard measurements (which  are laid out oddly) and each recipe is followed by a very technical  breakdown of its elements - even to the kilojoule of energy!  If you are a  carnivore, I think this could be a very useful book to have - or at least  to read.	2000-06-30

Gaby delves in detail into each vitamin and mineral (and hormone) crucial to the building and maintaining of bone,  sometimes exhaustively.  He cites numerous nutritional studies from  reputable medical journals and builds a comprehensive vision of nutrition's  role in the prevention or reversal of this terrible condition.  What this  book isn't, is a holistic program for osteoporosis.  Gaby only cursorily  mentions the role of exercise and spends less time on the various  medications available than other resources.

Books	4	110	113	N	N	A necessary resource	Considering my own love/hate relationship with Prednisone, I was very interested in this book, which was a delight to read.  I still can't believe the huge lack of information available on steroids, considering its  widespread use, and the personal nature of this story is very engaging.   The two authors are sisters, Julie a doctor and Eugenia a professional  flutist who develops a rare lung disease that requires steroid treatment.   There is an excellent question and answer formatted chapter between the two  sisters and an excellent chapter on the psychological effects of the  medication, with Eugenia describing how she felt on the medication and  Julie describing physically why she felt that way.  Since Eugenia works in  television as a cultural commentator she was especially concerned about  changes the medicine might affect in her appearance, and her sister gave  her excellent nutritional and exercise advice that is repeated in the book.   I do need to point out, however, that Eugenia could 1) afford the more  expensive food items, 2) had the time/energy to prepare them, and 3) could  physically exercise.  For others, including myself, who take Prednisone  during a massive physical crisis, bedrest and debilitating pain/lack of  energy necessitates us eating what is on hand or someone else buys (usually  prepared foods) and exercise can be an impossibility, hence the typical  Prednisone weight gain.  This book is still a must-have for anyone  personally dealing with this medication or with a loved one taking  steroids.	2000-06-30

While Part I of the book are these  fictionalized narratives and, quite frankly, lack emotional impact for me,  Part II is made up of several very well done self-exploration exercises  exploring feelings and aspects of chronic illness.

Gottschall developed this very restricted diet in response to her daughter developing a severe  case of ulcerative colitis.  She took her to a husband and wife M.D. team  who had published numerous works on Celiac disease and had developed the  &quot;Specific Carbohydrate Diet&quot; in response to weeding out foods  that trigger intestinal sensitivity.  With her daughter's positive response  to the diet, Gottschall began a campaign of her own to develop recipes that  fit within the guidelines as well as advocated in general about the  benefits of this program.<br />When they say &quot;specific carbohydrate&quot;  , that's no joke!  No flour of any kind, no rice, potatoes, pasta, nothing.   Any kind of commercially prepared foods are out of the question as added  starches are a common ingredient.  This is a no-gluten diet times ten.  You  grind your own nuts for flour for muffins and a pizza crust is made from  shredded zucchini!  The recipes in the book (and more than half the book is  the recipe portion) seem like they have the potential to be quite good,  however, I can't imagine existing on only 35 or so recipes for an extended  period of time.  Some proponents of the diet stay on it their entire lives  but other people have said they simply used the diet for a year or two and  then began reintroducing foods successfully.  Incredible discipline and  vigilance would be necessary to implement this diet to the letter, and I  can't help but note that, at least in the case of ulcerative colitis, many  individuals' disease &quot;burns out&quot; after a year or two which may  coincide with the &quot;cure&quot; this diet offers.  Nevertheless, I'm not  one to disregard the many testimonials this diet receives but would caution  any observant to keep a close watch on their nutritional requirements  (since IBD sufferers have difficulty absorbing many nutrients and an  elemental diet like this one might reduce available nutrients to begin with  - and vitamin supplements with its starches would be out of the question).	2000-06-30

Each chapter is an in-depth interview with various healers,  some from Western traditions, some with interests in Eastern traditions.   The quality of the interviews is sporadic; I felt that since Moyer's  doesn't have a medical background that there were times better questions  would have elicited a more interesting turn to the conversation.  Some  interviews will put you right to sleep unless comprehensive discussions of  neuropeptides excite the heck out of you!  The most informational  interviews came from physicians speaking about their fears and admitting to  the types of limitations and insecurities they experience in the course of  practicing - and how these fears are never discussed with patients in case  they should &quot;get too close&quot;.  For my purposes, the interview with  Ron Anderson, CEO of Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Texas was particularly  enlightening particularly his statement that &quot;But as we shift to more  chronic disease models, we've got to have people who are able to help take  care of themselves when they go home.  Chronic diseases have to be dealt  with as illness in the community and in the family.&quot; (p.33) And I  would add, in the workplace.  I wouldn't purchase this book, but taking it  out from the library for a quick skim would be fine.	2000-06-30

Grant is a straightforward, clinical writer and some readers might be put  off by his use of widespread, medical terminology.  Like any IBD books, the  drug sections become quickly dated, but Grant supplies good information on  existing drugs and surgeries.  He falls into the common pitfall of many  M.D.-authored books of completely ignoring the emotional aspects of  inflammatory bowel disease and does not seek to refer readers to resources  that might provide support.  This is a solid, useful reference for IBD  patients.	2000-06-30

Every chapter in this book is well written and scrupulously  up-to-date with excellent references and resources.  Chapter subjects are  very holistic in that both the medical and emotional aspects of IBD are  represented.  There is even a chapter on the use of alternative medicine in  the treatment of IBD!

My one criticism would be that when read consecutively, the chapter topics did  not seem to flow logically (to his credit, the author does state in the  introduction that he designed the book to be read in such a way that people  could skip around to what interested them).  Transformative change segways  into the midlife company which transitions into mergers and acquisitions -  a little jarring although always interesting.  I think this is definitely a  book to have on the Schein section of the bookshelf.	2000-06-30
US	52431159	R3VCRWSIMSWFNI	0062731378	868402611	The Essential Guide to Chronic Illness: The Active Patient's Handbook for: (see reading line)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Mediocre Resource for persons with chronic illness	While I couldn't disagree with the main premise of this book - that patients need to be informed partners with their physician in the management of their chronic illness - the fact that the author felt  compelled to write the book not only because of his deeply felt belief in  this partnership, but more because of the urgent need for this relationship  due to the increasingly impersonal nature of managed health care, disturbs  me.  Long does offer good advice in his chapter on selecting a managed  health care organization and what to look for when selecting a physician.   The author has a rather pat prevention and lifestyle section followed by a  chapter devoted to a discussion of each chronic disease.  The disease  information section I found to be very good, containing a thorough  discussion of drugs and valuable resource listings.  Long also has chapters  on terminal illness and chronic disease in the elderly.  He follows with  numerous appendices, which are relatively informative, with his  prescription drug appendix and glossary being the most valuable.  <br />I have  a couple pet peeves with this book centering on what I find to be  inadequate information regarding nutrition and vitamin supplements.  Long  goes out of his way to write &quot;avoid 'megavitamin doses&quot; but never  connects each disease with the specific nutritional deficiencies and  vitamin needs they possess.  He doesn't even encourage readers to take a  generic multivitamin/mineral supplement!  In his health care provider  directory, where he describes the background of individual health care  providers (i.e., nurse practitioners, gastroenterolgist, etc.), he lists  &quot;homeopathic physician&quot; as an &quot;outdated&quot; form of  medicine.  I'm sure the government of France, which requires homeopathic  remedies to be sold in pharmacies in that country, would express surprise  that they were peddling an &quot;outdated&quot; form of medicine.  Even if  Long didn't find compelling medicalevidence to support homeopathy, the  innocuous nature of this type of treatment deserves better treatment.  The  whole point of &quot;chronic&quot; illness centers on the fact that it is  &quot;chronic&quot; because the medical establishment has no cure.  With  that in mind, alternative therapies that would not harm and could possible  help alleviate symptoms need to be treated with more respect.<br />I found the  strongest aspect of Long's book to be his thorough understanding of how  chronic diseases affect all aspects of a patient's life.  &quot;A chronic  disorder can be one of life's most difficult challenges.  It can affect so  many aspects of our lives - impairing the basic activities of daily living,  compromising the pursuit of education and gainful employment, limiting  social interaction, and seriously degrading the quality of life.&quot;(p.7)   His observation that a patient who lives with a chronic disorder is faced  with three realities - coping with the health care system, coping with the  disorder itself, and coping with the emotional adjustment - also resonated  with me.  I felt disappointed that Long, while expressing so well the way  in which chronic disease affects an individual on so many levels,  completely neglects a more holistic approach to illness in his discussion  of each disease.  Only in the chapter on terminal illness is therapy and  support groups mentioned as an important aspect of treatment.  Overall,  read the book for information on conventional therapy for your specific  chronic disease but don't expect too much more.	2000-06-30

A wonderful mix of Weil's personal journey of being disaffected with the medical system, his travels abroad to  look for answers he could only find at home, stories of patients that  taught him key concepts about the body's inherent capacity to heal itself,  and discussion of herbal and mind/body research that has influenced his  work are only some of the main concepts he expounds upon in this volume.   The main crux of the book is short and sweet: the body can heal itself  because it is a healing system.  <br />Weil links the lack of doctor's belief  in this healing system directly to their education.  Medical students work  in teaching hospitals populated by patients who represent only one end of  the total spectrum of illness - the very sick.  Since in this group healing  responses occur less frequently than in the general population, doctors  develop pessimistic attitudes that are applied across the board to all seen  patients in their practice and often these attitudes are conveyed through  thoughtless remarks that are the equivalent of a &quot;medical curse&quot;.   These powerful words expressing little optimism for healing are often  internalized by the patient (although a chosen few will rebel and fight  against them just to prove the doctor wrong) and rob the patient of belief  in their own capacity to respond to their illness.<br />Building on these  concepts, Weil describes several of his patients and friends who, against  traditional medical odds, have undergone &quot;unexplained&quot;  spontaneous healing often from life-threatening conditions.  In almost all  cases, acceptance of the illness rather than struggle characterized a key  part of the healing process and indicated a mental shift that Weil believes  can initiate a transformation of the personality with it a healing of the  disease.  It's a relief for anyone finding hope for the medical profession  while reading this book that Weil has begun a revolutionary medical school  program in his home state of Arizona that begins to incorporate many of the  &quot;radical&quot; ideas found in this book.  This is a medical volume  that should be on everyone's shelf.	2000-06-30
US	52431159	R1WHL3JHEHF8AG	0449000745	245886240	Dr. Rosenfeld's Guide to Alternative Medicine: What Works, What Doesn't--and What's Right for You	Books	2	18	38	N	N	Disrespect takes away from author's credibility	Dr. Rosenfeld, despite his grandfatherly appearance on the cover of this book, has a sharp wit which often degenerates to outright sarcasm in the course of this work.  <br />I did find Dr. Rosenfeld's review of  &quot;traditional&quot; scientific studies that have been conducted around  alternative medical theories informative.  His emphasis on the  double-blind, placebo study does have its limitations, however, and like  many traditional Western doctors, Dr. Rosenfeld considers &quot;anecdotal  evidence&quot; to be of significantly less scientific relevance because of  its inability to take into account the numerous additional variables  encountered.  Even those therapies without Western science to back them up  get reviewed by the author and he makes a point of saying, even if he  completely discounts any theory behind the methodology, what possible  dangers a therapy might hold for people with various conditions or whether  the therapy really isn't capable of hurting anyone if they really want to  try it.  <br />The most disturbing and off-putting element of this book is Dr.  Rosenfeld's &quot;humor&quot; laced throughout the book.  While bad puns  like the chapter title &quot;High Colonics and Coffee Enemas: Public Enema  Number One&quot; could possibly be ignored, episodes like the section on  Ayurvedic medicine in which the author makes fun of the  &quot;tongue-twisting&quot; Hindi words for the various doshas by comparing  them to &quot;something from a Danny Kaye movie&quot; cannot.  I found that  while Dr. Rosenfeld was obviously trying to include in his information on  each therapy anything that could possibly be construed as dangerous for a  patient seeking help, he ended up including very outdated information that  I doubt is seriously practiced any longer (like smearing individuals with  goat dung to treat alcoholism Ayurvedically which the author admits  probably isn't done at all currently but he still makes a point of  mentioning it).  If Dr. Rosenfeld had left out his &quot;humor&quot; the  book would be much easier to read and the book would reflect the balance  that is inherent within it.  This balance is often obscured by his  &quot;wit&quot; unfortunately.	2000-06-30

Unless you are  a bodywork specialist, this book probably has much more than you would ever  want to know about what seem to be some very esoteric practices.  However,  it is a fabulous resource to use to find out about alternative therapies  (the section on acupuncture was the most comprehensive and easy to read I  have come across in all my research) and Stillerman has a wonderful  bibliography and resource listing (many resources have been transcribed  into my Complementary Medicine Resources list).  Reading it from cover to  cover as I did was an interesting experience in that it showed the  interrelated qualities and history of many types of bodywork (some  individuals had the same teachers or came out of the same schools of  thought and developed in their own direction).  Stillerman does not judge  any of the bodywork methods she reviews so it is up to the reader to decide  whether or not a particular method would be right for their condition (this  is where the bibliography and resource list is invaluable for further  investigation).  An excellent resource but unless you're a massage/bodywork  professional, you probably won't want to purchase this book - just borrow  it from the library.	2000-06-30

Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the level of  scholarship in this volume.  Her earlier chapters centering on the  development of the clinical concept of &quot;hysteria&quot; through the  19th and early 20th century are her strongest and best researched and the  insights she makes regarding connections between influential thinkers are  excellent. <br />Showalter ties the psychological basis of vaguely explained  or ephemeral illness to more modern diseases like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome  with its numerous psychological and physical symptoms and pinpoints the  difficulty of many chronic illness sufferers.  Namely that we &quot;live in  a culture that still looks down on psychogenic illness, that does not  recognize or respect its reality.  The self-esteem of the patient depends  on having the physiological nature of the illness accepted.  The culture  forces people to deny the psychological, circumstantial, or emotional  sources of their symptoms and to insist that they must be biological and  beyond their control in order for them to view themselves as legitimately  ill...&quot;  While this insight is excellent and, I believe, very true, what  the author misses out on is the profound personal nature of the experience  of chronic illness with its various ramifications.   <br />Her final  conclusion - that feminism and the feminist interpretation of the  &quot;hysteria&quot; phenomenon has raised women's expectations of  themselves without the inherent power to fulfill those expectations and  that the way we should deal with this outcome is simply to study the  various aspects of hysteria further -falls flat and does not seem to be  well-grounded in the previous context of the book.  Unless you are really  interested in 19th century medical/women relationships (the one strong  point of the book), I think you can miss this one.	2000-06-30

Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease.  He spends a great deal  of time outlining a &quot;low-residue&quot; diet as well as a low-oxalate  diet, both of which are purported to assist persons suffering from IBD.   Since both diets are quite nutritionally sound, they are certainly worth  trying and his discussion on lactose sensitivity is one of the most  balanced I've read.  With only one chapter pertaining to IBD, it might be  more practical to request this book interlibrary loan rather than purchase  it, but if you have other family members with other digestive problems, the  other chapters may have increased relevance and applicability!	2000-06-30

In Ayurvedic medicine, most diseases originate as an imbalance in  the digestive system based on the principle that the constant renewal of  every part of the human physiology is dependent on proper digestive  functioning.  Ayurveda views digestion as the body's means of extracting  intelligence from food and then processing it to support the intelligence  inherent in the entire human physiology.  Gives new meaning the words  &quot;junk food&quot;, doesn't it?<br />Once again, advice is given according  to dosha type (see above review for a more in depth discussion of doshas)  and numerous suggestions are made for improving digestive health.  It is  important to note that this book is not written for someone suffering from  a specific digestive illness - it is rather meant to improve overall  digestion, and as a result health, for the average person who just needs a  gastrointestinal tune-up.  The holistic nature of the suggestions would  have far-reaching mind/body impacts for anyone's well being so this small  book belongs in everyone's personal library.	2000-06-30

They have the standard chapters on dealing with diagnosis,  initially coping with difficult symptoms, how illness affects the family,  etc.  They also have a chapter on the Health Care system that is typical of  chronic illness books and REALLY bothers me - it's the usual tract on being  a good patient and what the doctor needs from you.  Most of these  &quot;types&quot; of chapter acknowledge what you need from a doctor but  make a point of saying you aren't likely to get it - a truism, but never  easy to hear and it always angers me that in addition to being sick, we  have to do all the work for taking charge of our health care too!  <br />This  book does have strong points, don't get me wrong.  The premise that  &quot;consciousness of your story can free you to understand yourself more  deeply and to change in directions that make your life more livable&quot;  is very true and the authors strongly encourage individual therapy to  support people in their quest for mental health during a chronic illness.   The chapter on empathic listening is one of the most constructive tools  I've seen in this type of book yet, and would be a boon to relationships in  which no chronic illness was present!  However, with two authors and often  disjointed chapters and writing, I wondered about the sophistication of  editing this book experienced.  My recommendation would be to turn to other  sources before consulting this one.	2000-06-30

As a result, the material, while interesting and occasionally  insightful, lacks focus.  I did appreciate that each of the chapters  (focusing on one of the stages) began with a well-written dramatization of  someone coping with chronic illness followed by the author's analysis of  how the characters handled the issues involved.  I realized this book would  be an excellent book for an illness support group to read and discuss  chapter by chapter.	2000-06-30

Kron became a therapist  specializing in chronic illness issues and how they impact the self and  family.  The book itself is written in a question and answer format (the  author had a column &quot;Ask Audrey&quot; for years and derives much of  her information and inspiration from that) and while the questions are very  basic (and the answers common sense for the most part), the writing is good  and resources are listed although they are a little outdated.  I found a  question directed to how a chronically ill person should evaluate possible  careers to be of especial relevance.  Audrey's advice: try to find work  with flexible hours, look at contractual work where you can set your own  pace, become your own boss, find a situation where someone can easily fill  in for you, look at jobs with increased mobility (so you can carve out time  to rest/ use the bathroom), identify something you love to do, find an  understanding boss and coworkers, find a job with flexibility to tailor the  work to your needs (disability laws require this), and become so good at  what you do that you're in demand despite your illness.  All good advice,  presuming a certain level of skill and stamina.	2000-06-30
