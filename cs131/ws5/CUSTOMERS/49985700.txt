I love America and anyone who say the war is bad, just ain't for the troops and that is final.  I love the troops and the Iraqi's, and I love to see the war.  Hannity has shown me that I can love family and Christian church and still love war.  All he says is, \\"They got the weapons and they want to take away our lord\\".  That is it!  It is just that black and white.  We need to kill'em all over there cept the Iraqi's whose a good people.  I can't wait to spend billions over there, while things collapse around here.  I love them Iraqi's so much, I am happy to give up my social security and my childrens education.  We had to take Sadaam out, cause we put him in there and he loves the chemical weapons.  Hannity's book is great cause it is pretty much whatever the conservatives say he agrees and whatever the librals say he bashes.  I love stuff you don't have to think about too much.  Kinda like pro wrestling - Good and Evil/Black and White/Right and Wrong.  Ain't no Gray in the U.S. of A.  Kinda catchy ain't it.

He is obviously skilled in \\"spinning a good yarn\\" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries.	2003-01-07

This book has it all; suspense, God, devil, hell, and action galore.  This is what we need more of in the world... good wholesome Christian violence stories.  Stories that show kids how they will burn for not believing in the lamb.  How can we convince people to believe in our dogma if we can't give them consequences for their actions.  This is the perfect holidat gift for the atheist in your home.  It will teach them a lesson in the vengeful and murderous side of our everforgiving and loving God.  I am glad to be Christian in this time of year, but if things don't start changing to the Christianity side here pretty soon in this country I am gonna have to convert or something.  I need salvation and spite in my life.  Christians use to be the baddest kid on the block, now it is Islam.  They understand religion over there, kill for the lord.  Just like the tribulation forces and Nicolae.  It won't be long now... Christian soldiers will soon unite and end the world in a firey blaze of glory.

I decided to read this book and open my mind to the creationist point of view.  What I found was an astonishing array of unsupported accousations, heresay, and blatant promotion of Christianity.  The book reads as a pamphlet for why you should go to church and be a christian.  As somebody who has studied the other side (scientific evolution) I am amused at the way it has been depicted.  The author refers to evolution as atheistic at least 50 times in the book.  Talk about biased.   I am around teenage kids who are getting fed this militant psuedoscience at their churches on a weekly basis, and they are buying into to it.  Evolution and its evidences can be quite technical and to put it into terms the kids understand means a watered down version is what they get.  It becomes easy to refute with little nuggets of misinformed creationist propoganda.  It is scary!!  Fundamentalism in not only in Arab nations, it is right here in the USA in the form of young earth creatism.  In the end the author even has the audacity to say something to the effect of... if you believe in god and he exists then you have won, if he doesn't what did you lose.  If you don't believe in god and he doesn't exist what did you gain, if he does exists you get to go to hell.  The moral is believe in God, what do you have to lose.  Is it just me or is this a horrible way to live your spiritual life.  \\"I might as well believe, cause he might exist and who knows\\"  What happened to questioning and skepticism.  This book is ridiculous and hilarious at the same time.  I wish everyone would read this book to see the biased and prejudicial sentiments that are running rampant.	2002-11-22
US	49985700	RE5UZMA0RYBZQ	0553061747	959749263	The End Of Science: Facing The Limits Of Knowledge In The Twilight Of The Scientific Age	Books	4	4	10	N	N	Great book, interesting theory, intriguing interviews	Some of the people who reviewed this book are extremely full of themselves, pious, pretentious, and afraid of challenging viewpoints.  I may not have the credentials that some the so called critics on this page claim to have, but I know something of the nature of science.  I was a biology major and geology minor in college and now teach an Earth and Space science class at the high school level.  I am sure I have just caused a few smurks from the elistist crowd of \\"reviewers\\", but that is fine because I am comfortable with my grasp of scientific knowledge.  I would like to start off by saying that I don't necessarily agree with everything Mr. Horgan puts forth in his \\"hypothesis\\".  I do believe, however, that his claims have merit and are extremely engaging and thought provoking.  The following are my opinions on his assertions.<br />1.  Is science moving away from pure reserarch to profit driven applied science?  Yes<BR>2.  Will science be able to continue its progress forever?  The real answer I believe is yes, but the author contends - no.  Why?<br />He states this not because he believes science can't continue, he is merely stating(I believe) that society as a whole is ignorant and indifferent to pure scientific research.  He states that all fundamental discoveries of nature have already been found and everything else is merely details.  I disagree with this, but I agree that society will not be willing to dish out money to fund the scientific endeavors of the future unless they are profit driven.  Look at our culture today - people are more interested in viagra than smashing subatomic particles, rogaine than piecing together the lineage of homo sapiens, prozac than discovering the beginnings and eventual fate of our universe.  People as a whole are shallow, superficial, and materialistic, and further more cannot comprehend the far reaching vision it takes to support pure science.  The other reviewers are missing the point - science could go on forever, we couldkeep filling in the details and making new discoveries over and over - but two things will be missing (1) money (2) public support.  Without these things science will turn into blind religious bigotry and intolerence - it is cheaper!!!<br />In conclusion, it is my belief that Mr. Horgan does not lack creative imagination and thought, but rather it is our society and its short sighted, narrow minded, bubble gum approach to life that is the true evil in this equation.  It was said once to understand the true virtures of a society you should spend time in their jails and schools.  We all know what the jails are like and I am here to tell you our schools are certainly not a breading ground for new Einstiens and Darwins.  Look out universe here we come!!!	2002-02-01

First of all, science could never validate creationism because it is based on religous scripture that deals with intangible things (walking of water, miraculous cures, stopping the sun, and other things which defy science)<br />How can this science deny such fundamental discoveries like; radioactive dating, doppler effect (supporting the big bang), evolution by natural selection, and punctuated equilibrium.  These are fundamental tenets to science and give us an accurate potrayal of our world.  It baffles me to think that people will go to epic links to belch forth their brand of ignorant and intolerent \\"science\\".  I would like to propose this scenerio.... had the bible never been written and all we had to go on was man's instincts and intelligence, what conclusion would we come to independent of religous belief.  If there was no \\"moral\\" scripture to guide/control our thoughts, how would our view of earth's history be changed.  Would we have evolution vs. creationism debates?  We have to ask ourselves if our religous fervor is controlling our rational minds.  Are these people so afraid of a life without biblical fanaticism that they will intentionally put out falsified information.  It is books like this that make me believe that god is most certainly indifferent to our plight on earth, otherwise he wouldn't put such self-righteous, sanctimonious zealots here on earth to pollute our minds.  Science is the answer, because it has no bias, if there was proof of god and the hand he/she played in our creation science would be the first to admit it.  The evidence doesn't suggest the fairy tale these \\"writers\\" would have us believe.	2002-02-01

I will break this into 2 segements - <br />1.  The Book<BR>this book was an interesting 1 or 2 day read for an avid reader, or a 4 or 5 day read for a toilet reader - either way it is a short nugget of a phish tour from the author's perspective.  I was pleased with what I read, because I took it for what it was worth.  This was not a phish bible written by the head lizard of prussia.  This was an ordinary guy who has responsibilities in life and he went out and observed life on tour and wrote about it.  That was the book, period.  It was not meant to validate or justify the life of the psuedo-hippy, trust-fund hippy, college hippy, doing it because its a fad hippy, i smoke pot hippy, i smoke pot, do acid, do shrooms, drink imports, eat ectasy, trade tapes, have a van, dog, and a cheese sandwich maker hippy.  It was meant to give people his perspectives on the shows and adventures he had.  I will admit that most of the book was rather lame and boring (it seemed he spent too much time talking about getting started on the book???????)  A masterpiece it was not, but it was not meant to be - so get over it<br />2.  The people<br />I love phish - I think phish is talented, original, quirky, jazzy, jammy, and all together cool.  They don't appear to be self-absorbed or sanctimonious, and are certainly not in to what others think about them.  All this being said - I have never met a group of people, as a whole, more pretentious than some of the so called phish critics on this page.  Some of you phish fans must wake up in the morning think you are like one of trey's best friends or something.  Do you really think you are a character in the man who stepped into yesterday.  Do you think Tela, Col. Forbin, and Wilson are real people.  It is just music, great music with great philosophy, but just music.  It isn't real life.  You can't wake up in the morning put on Hoist, light up a joint and watch the world pass by all your life.  Face it - The members of phish are not slackers - they work on their craft, they are industrious and organized - they have some ambition.  Playing the guitar and sitting in front of computer, trading tapes, and smoking cigarettes isn't going to get you closer to Nirvana or utopia.  Get a life, get a job, and get off your soapbox - you bunch of pseudo-intellectual, quasi-hippy degenerates that think that if I read books and eat acid I must be smart and with it.  What a sad and lame bunch most of you truly are!!!!!!!	2002-01-28

This is an obvious misprint for anyone who knows ANYTHING about the bible.  Another horrible blunder by the author was to include a dog and cat as unlikely heroes of Christian soldiers.

That is the message of the lord, believe what we do and be saved or think for yourself and spend eternity in the fiery depths of hell with the wicked lucifer.

There is one point I would like to make - Can the author, Jerry &quot;Koresh&quot; Jenkins, take his pile of wealth he has accumulated to heaven with the rest of the saints?  If this is the end of times and all of  the signs are there, why waste your time charging people for this book?  What good will your money be when the lord comes to burn the earth?  This  book is nothing more than a sensationalistic piece of gargabe with a sole  intent on stealing money from people who have nothing better to do than  thumb their nose at all the non-believers.  Why all the need for material  wealth when the rapture is upon us?  Get real!	2000-04-23

Jerry Jenkins is right, the lord is coming very soon and I just don't know if I can wait any longer.  I am 64 years old and don't have much longer to live, so I just hope the lord hurries up and comes down so I can see all the flesh boiling.  I am so excited about his arrival that I do nothing more than sit in my chair and  count the seconds waiting for the rapture.  I think it will be great!   (because of course I am saved - How do I know?  Because I went to church  every Sunday and said my prayers and ate my spinach like a good little boy)  This book tells all about how the good lord is coming for the sinners  (druggies, hippies, people with alternative lifestyles other than mine).   I'm sure the apocolypse will happen any day now because I have been wanting  it so bad, and this book reaffirms my belief that it will happen.  And for  all you believers out there - Go ahead and pray for it, it couldn't hurt!	2000-04-13

I was raised in a christian household where we didn't question the literal truth of the bible and Jesus was a white man who was not of this earth.  When I grew up and became a man, I  resented the teachings I was given and rebelled against the church (and  became a die hard athiest)   After reading this book I was overwhelmed with  a sense a inspiration and awe that no minister could ever plant in my soul.   I saw for the first time the passion of Christ through the eyes of Jesus  the man.  I still am very much against organized religion and all its  hippocrites, but I now refer to myself as agnostic.  For someone to write  these beautiful words about such a loving and tolerant man, proves that  there must be some sort of an oversoul (like Emerson's).  This is a must  read book for the open minded soul who has questions about their  fundamentalist upbringing.  It is not for those who are intolerant, close  minded, and think they have all the answers.  Jesus spoke of love and  compassion, he didn't judge his fellow man like most all christians do  today (gays, muslims, jews, different races, hindus, drug users, and anyone  who doesn't agree with them), Jesus would have not tried to change them by  condeming them.  Jesus would have loved them - nothing more.  Fanaticism  breeds contempt, the more fanatical and judgemental you are the more people  will stop listening to you!  By the way, Jesus was more than likely not a  white, european, english speaking man.  He was a Jew who probably looked  more of Eygptian descent.  Open your mind and heart and read this book -  Absolutely mind shattering and sure to be a tear jerker for the  compassionate soul.	2000-04-09

This book is pure hogwash.  This whole notion of God Vs. the devil is nothing more than a step backwards for our struggling culture.  This book gives the reader the idea  that their is a devil here on earth making people do bad things, and we  need a savior to &quot;save&quot; us all.  I don't buy it  one bit.  There  is no evil force turning our souls rotten, what happened to free will.  I  hate it when people start talking about hell and heaven as tangible places  where our souls actually go.  These places and peoples (Satan, angels,  etc.) are dreams of a confused animal that has lost its way.  True  immortality comes from within the heart and mind, as well as through our  offspring which shares half of our genetic infomation.  Face it, there is  no such thing as heaven, hell, or the devil - they are metaphors for our  own insecurities!	2000-04-06

I can't wait until the movie comes out	This might be the best book any elitist, intolerant, bigot has ever written.  It has it all.  It tells you how to live, what to believe, and even what is wrong and right.  It is my hope that this book will be in classrooms everywhere someday.  Students should just burn all history and  biology books and read this book over and over again until it has  completely brainwashed them.	2000-03-24

That is what this church was founded on right.  Jesus couldn't stand them &quot;non-believers&quot; and  Romans, so he told God, &quot;Come and get me lord&quot; And he did!  I  can't believe schools won't let this book in as a required textbook for  students.  I guess it must be them EVILutionists that are brain washing  people into thinking sinful thoughts.  I just pray everyone will someday  think just like us so the world will all be the same and we can finally get  some salvation around here.  It is my hope this book will help people  become more intolerant of others beliefs and wishes, just like the lord  wants it.	2000-03-16

If you like to have your entire perception of the world changed, this is the book for you.  Cheers to Lightman for his outstanding ability  to capture the imagination of his reader with releastic alternative  realities.  Absolutely mind shattering, paradigm obliterating, and awe  inspiring material.	2000-03-13

Indescribable in its poetic genious, and jaw dropping implications.  I can't stop wondering about the endless possibilities that  lounge in the secrets of our universe.  Lightman makes you think about the  world in such ways that the mass of society would surely frown upon it.   This is not a book for the so called &quot;pseudo-intelluctal&quot;, but  for a reader who questions traditions and the world around them.  Anyone  who reads this needs to be open to a shifting of their paradigm structure  as they know it.  Read it and learn!	2000-03-12
US	49985700	R17X5ZPTMZFLVZ	0345376595	691321715	Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Sagan is the messiah of marketing astronomy	After having just watched the movie, &quot;Mission to Mars&quot; it is obvious the Sagan's impact on scientific popular culture is growing exponentially.  Movies such as Contact, Armageddon, Deep Impact, and even  (regrettably) Rocketman, have been shaping public perception of our species  future in space.  I believe Sagan has been responsible for this recent  explosion in the interest of space.  Of course I realize the findings of  the &quot;supposed&quot; fossilized Mars life has played a huge part in  this as well.  Sagan is magnificent in his ability to pull the reader in  and open his/her mind to the truly important things in life - truth,  discovery, and skepticism.  This book is a truly a steeping stone in our  pursuit towards the ultimate question - where are we going?  Space the  final frontier.	2000-03-12
US	49985700	R3EN1ROMBBWAQE	0345384725	413866135	Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors	Books	5	54	58	N	N	Carl Sagan breathes humanity into the souls of his readers	From DNA, Darwin, and Huxley to dominance, submission, and primates this book has it all.  Carl Sagan was simply a shaman of words and wisdom, while being a prophet of science and rational thought.  Shadow's of forgotten  ancestors is Sagan's finest hour with unwavering skepticism and a passion  unparalleled in the scientific community.  I have read this book cover to  cover twice, and still feel as though it will have more insight to offer as  I begin to read it a third time.  The book reveals the egocentric nature of  man and his attitudes toward animals as lesser organisms based on ancient  fears of his own past  .  Animals are very complex and intelligent, a  sentiment that is for some a deplorable idea with atheist and Darwinian  connotations.  Sagan simply diffuses the idea to his readers that animals  have the ability to feel complex emotions and acquire learned behaviors  from parents, just as humans.  It is not the author's intention to drag  humans through the mud of the animal world, but, rather, lift the animals  up to the level of humans by showing our similarities which include:  reproductive strategies, behavior patterns, altruism, love, and the  perpetuation of the species.  Sagan offers an alternative view of the  world, a world in which man shares the Earth with other organisms and  accepts their differences rather than condemning them.  Such an optimistic  belief in a world that breeds hate, bias, and indifference.  Anyone who  reads this book and still believes man is superior to animals and holds a  special place in the world, missed the entire point and needs their  compassion spoon fed to them.	2000-02-27
