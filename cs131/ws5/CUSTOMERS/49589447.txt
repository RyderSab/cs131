I know I was not.  My husband was and still is a most important person in my life.  I felt totally disconnected when he died and still struggle with it daily.  If not for this wonderful book of daily meditations, there are days when getting out of bed would have been more than I could do.  6 months after Jack's death, I am now able to occasionally notice the lovely blue sky, hear the birds signing, and feel the sun on my face.  My grief therapy is only effective in the slow healing of this grievous wound in my soul with the daily reminders in this compilation by Hickman and being encouraged to recall the wonderfulness of Jack, my husband, my best friend, my life love.	2005-04-09

The word \\"practical\\" is a most important focus in the title.  In reading, I found a sense of calm in knowing that I was not losing my mind, or going crazy, or just plain weird.  As a \\"new\\" widow, I find the emptiness overwhelming at times and picking up this book (between counseling sessions) is a great boost to my sense of where I am now.	2005-01-20

But if you have read the four previous Earth's Children books, then you will find great comfort in Ayla and Jondolar settling into a home and family after the travels and travails of their earlier episodes.  This book took a long time (1 month) for me to read and I took to it slowly and comfortably.  There is repetition in this that could have been omitted which would have reduced the page count of the book, but I do not find the repetition painful at all.  This is a slow, quiet read and I certainly have enjoyed Jondolar's \\"return home\\" with Ayla opening the world of the Zelandonii to others.  Be patient with this book and it will reward you.	2002-09-27

Traveling with Harry from Mulholland, through Nichols' Canyon and over to Tuxedo Terrace, Connelly brings all of the flora (good and bad) of the area to his stories.  The &quot;Last Coyote&quot; and the &quot;Poet&quot; were good, but this episode with Harry Bosch truly put things in perspective.  Thank you, Mr. Connelly, for a wonderful read.

The Adamses deliver their messages in their own words (through their letters) with Mr. McCullough filling in gaps with interesting paragraphs and setting scenes for the next message from these wonderful people.  We in American are very fortunate to have had such people to commence our republic and Mr McCullough does us a great favor by reminding us with this wonderful tome.  As an aside, I am not a frequent reader of biographies or history but &quot;John Adams&quot; by David McCullough is a terrific book about an incredible time and fantastic people.

This was a slow starter and then I just slowly moved through the book until about 1/3 of the way through.  Maybe it is because I am not a frequent reader of the &quot;English&quot; mystery -- although I do really enjoy contemporary mysteries.  I also like mysteries that &quot;teach&quot; me something.  This book got me into antique and collectible books and kept my interest in discussions about the Masons, revisionism, forgeries, book clubs (Folio B), publishers and revisionism.

When will we have the ability to evaluate skill and talent beyond skin color or accent?  This book reminds us to appreciate eachother.  This should be required reading in our junior high schools as part of American history/social studies.	2000-10-23

(I picked it up because I am a &quot;Jeopardy&quot; fan.)  I liked it, so I moved on to Likely to Die.  I liked that one, too.  So, naturally, I picked up Cold Hit.  When I got to the end of one chapter and found myself sitting in my chair at 1am on a weekday morning (I leave for the office at 6:30 am), with my hand over my mouth saying, &quot;Oh, my. . .!&quot;  Well, this is by far the best!  Read it now!	2000-10-18

This was a spontaneous purchase  because I liked the title.  I figured that the author had a sense of humor.   Boy!  Does she?!  This is a nice moving book with lots of insider  information on the food industry as well as inside the beltway.  The  characters are well-rounded (and not perfect).  I liked every character and  did not want a single one of them to be the &quot;dirty guy.&quot;  The  food details without the recipes littering the content is a welcome change,  and walking the city streets can help the psyche -- try it!  I will  definitely buy more from this author.	2000-09-05

I can hear the lilt in  the lore peppering this book and I love every bit of it.  This book is like  having an intimate conversation with Brenna, Aidan, Shawn and Molly. Even  Jude's visions of Lady Gwen feel like my own. What a wonderful book.  I can  hardly wait to get into &quot;Tears of the Moon&quot;!	2000-08-30

Half-way through the book, I am into an interesting political omlette.  I feel like I am plodding through  muck.  Thank heavens for the interesting middle -- otherwise, this is not  worth the price of the hardback nor my precious reading time.	2000-08-25

Have been a Cornwell reader for years and Reichs  deserves as strong a following.  Love the detail of her investigation and  her method of getting the reader involved in all the nuances of her work  and family relationships.  Reichs really gets into the biker world but,  thankfully, does not wallow in the slime.  She is focused on her  investigation and never loses sight of her purpose -- who, what, where and  why.  The &quot;why&quot; can be a distasteful jolt, and Reichs manages to  deliver satisfaction to the end.  The reader is a definite participant on  this literary ride.	2000-08-11

What makes the  series stand out is Savannah's personal relationships (from family to  friends to enemies) and the variety of personalities involved in her world.   Of course, being a private investigator exposes Reid,et al. to a variety  of characters with a variety of responses.  Oh, but this series is fun!   Every book is a must read!	2000-08-09

Bought this book on Friday night, started it on lunch break at work on Tuesday.  Finished it Tuesday night before going to bed.  Great book!  Could not put this book down.  Not just a personal profile of McCone, but  insights into us all and our concept of who we are.  Really was involved in  this case with Sharon and when I got to the last page, I wanted to keep  going.  How long must I wait for the next episode?  Too long.  More.  More.	2000-08-02

My sister told me about the Anne George series and am I ever glad that she did.  Mouse and Aunt Sister coming out with another book is just what I needed to avoid another day of laundry and cleaning and grocery shopping.   I cannot do anything but sit down in my chair with my glass of tea and  laugh myself silly, chapter after chapter.  The only drawback is that now I  have to wait 'til July 2001 for the next series of chuckles.  &quot;Torch&quot; will start you off laughing when you see Fred's reaction  after his return flight home.  You can take it from there. Another great  read from Anne George.	2000-08-01
