In short it is  a documentation of God's beautiful earth from the eye of a creative photographer.	2005-03-21

The pictures are really inspiring, but in order to get similar results you need a heavy weight pocket, as most of the photos were taken with fast lens that are not cheap basically, i highly recommend it and i am glad i baught it, at a price so low for it's real value.	2004-04-16

Among all the stories which popup every day, this is one story that we should tell our children exactly how and why it happened, the book as the movie did, presented the whole enigma in such a fantastic realistec way, you feel actually living with the characters breathing with them, at times joining in discussions... the complexity and huge number of names and sides in the story means it is not for teatime at all, you really need to concentrate well with this one.  The event was a tragedy no question about it, and what the late Mr.Garrison tried to do was to prevent what we are witnessing now a days by disclosing the truth, to tell the truth is a courageous mission, to stick to it and face such enormous powers ready to do any thing even kill the president is even harder.  I do recommend that we should have a copy of this story whether as a book or as film, for the sake of history which is always twisted by the claws of the most powerful .	2004-03-04

You will find many approaches for each operation. of course it will be impossible to gather all the surgical craft in one book. but this one succeeds in collecting a large chunk of it. i highly recommend it for all juniors and postgrads alike.	2003-07-16

But we will all agree that we need some desent plans to understand the projects, now THAT is the ONLY drawback here, you lose orientation inside these magnificant houses because the figures of the plans are microscopic and poorly labled. this affects how much you can get out of the book. otherwise it is wounderful.	2003-06-29

This book contains a selection from his work, from bridges (for which he is famous), to monuments to many other examples. the text is concise, photos are nice, but the figures are small in most of the times, trying to keep a small size low cost volume. Needs an experienced eye to understand fully what the figures are. apart from that the book is great, the book's subject is even greater.	2003-05-12

This book hits and misses in trying to collect the basics for surgical knowledge and more.<BR>You'll find many missing points which you can fill from the internet or from magazines or other resources.<BR>Most of the chapters are excellent and are probably all what you might need for your college study like those on trauma, diseases of the thyroid and parathyroid, metabolic response to injury etc.. but there are some which are disasterous like the chapter on breast conditions, but probably the subject itself is complex and controversial anyway.<BR>The text overall is very well written and the structure and design of each chapter is very logical, some figures are not so great though, plus the book needs an update. you might consider supplementing it with Surgical clinics of north amarica for some of the chapters you read.	2003-05-08

The only thing is that it is increasing necessary for the authors to update this edition. laproscopy in many situations is still -on the pages of this edition- in the cradle!!, which is not the true case, and many indications for some investigations have changed. but after all this is medicine. if you have this text and keepon with Advances in Surgery or Surgical Clinics of North America then you would cover most of the defects.	2002-11-02

It is a good choice for medical students and surgical residents in there very beginnings but not beyond. This edition has been printed in style, if u have ever passed over the previous ones u could realize the differences. <BR>  still though it needs more on managing trauma, and more details regarding laparoscopy. And probably a larger chapter on operative techniques in general. The images are generally good although some of them date back to really old editions.<BR>  It really depends on what u want from a book, thats all.	2002-11-02

The examples and their implementation are very useful and easy to do, the book presumes that u have a sizable knowlege in perspective and other techniques of drawing but helps to improve your skills in COLORED presentations taking various examples from drawing shinning objects to full scale projects. The description of materials in the beginning is short though, but is enough for the intermediate user, and the book heavily uses the PRISMACOLOR markers so if u are not used to these and don't intend to use them look for another manual. In short it is a job well done!	2002-02-25

The book starts by explaining the different types of pastels and papers and other instruments and tools of the trade... that is very useful for selecting which for what. then he gives an account regarding the different basic and lateron advanced techniques of pastel drawing, the book has an array of examples which are simple and fairly easy an reproducible, you won't stand there saying how did he do that?. then it assends with the complexity to lift to a higher level. As in any book about art, the important thing is having the talent to be able to extract the most out of these  books.	2002-02-09

Omura has done a great job. The chapters are very well designed, taking you step by step without rush through the basics of autocad and the platform, then famialarizing you with some basic commands and components supported bt exercises, lateron while you buildup a project you learn more advanced commands and tricks, for me as a beginner i found grasping the material written which was alot very easy. the exercises are very useful, the CD is a great deal containing the mastering autocad 2000 instant reference guide and lots more, the figures are very well showen.<BR> The book could use some &quot;speed&quot; though, some times you feel a bit &quot;still&quot; there is sometimes too much description for things which could seem too much basic. and the chapter on the 3D modeling and design could use some more work, i am planning to buy a specialized book for that purpose.<BR>but all in all i think if i was to choose i would buy this book again.	2001-12-26
