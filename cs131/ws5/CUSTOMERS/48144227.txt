I had a friend who actually read &quot;Narcissus in Chains&quot; first, even though I explained repeatedly it was the 10th and latest Anita Blake novel.  She said, &quot;I know why you like this so much.  It's porn.&quot;  Of course, if you start from the beginning of the series like a normal human being then Anita Blake's descent into erotica is a bit more subtle.  The good news is that there is apparently, possibly, maybe a resolution to the Anita-Jean Claude-Richard love triangle.  The bad news is that Hamilton is covering the same ground: Anita has new powers, they come in handy at the right moment, power struggles abound, love life is in tatters, etc.  Then again, I have to admit that Anita becoming comfortable with her sexuality would be &quot;new.&quot;  But to tell the truth I read these books for the horror and violence,  at which Hamilton is a master.  I just hope this series does not become like John Norman's Gore series when the sex overwhelmed the characters and plot.  Unfortunately, I am afraid, I am very afraid...	2002-01-19

But then the type of vampire Quincey Morris becomes in this novel by P. N. Elrod is not the same sort of vampire as Dracula or any other &quot;traditional&quot; vampire.  This is more the &quot;good guy&quot; vampire which appears in Elrod's other vampire novels.  So the rest of the crew of vampire hunters have to contend not only with the fact their friend from Texas is now one of the walking undead, but, to recall a line from &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers,&quot; he is not &quot;that kind&quot; of a vampire.  However, I do enjoy the way Elrod takes down the high and might Abraham Van Helsing, the original know it all of the vampire universe.  Do not ask me to explain why I like that so much, but I do.	2001-10-16

Hoyt is concerned with blood fetishes.  Like similar books which try to deal clincially with &quot;vampires,&quot; this book makes a good case but most of us will not find it as fascinating as we do the stuff Bram Stoker, Anne Rice, Laurell K. Hamilton and Joss Whedon have been coming up with.  However, if you are interested in medical/psychological approaches to vampirism, this book is as good a place to start as any.	2001-10-16

Stoker's device of trying to let all of the characters tell their own story in the first person gets a bit trite after a while, but what is important here is that he sets the rules for what everybody knows about vampires.  The first half of the book, while the Count entertains Jonathan Harker and first comes to London and preys upon Lucy and Mina, is the best part of the book.  The final chase and staking of Dracula ends up being somewhat anticlimatic.  Still, I think this book reads better than &quot;Frankenstein.&quot;  Oh, and I do know enough about science to recognize that someone drained of blood cannot receive a transfusion from everybody.  A minor error given the times, but it still makes me smile.  &quot;Dracula&quot; remains the standard by which Anne Rice and the rest who have followed in his footsteps are necessarily judged.	2001-07-15

You will read about Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, of course, but also of Terence Fisher and some of the other directors the studio employed to lesser degrees of success.  I especially like when Hunter talks about how the studio decided to approach the Dracula series (you know I have a soft spot in my heart for the undead).  It is amazing how well I remember so many of these movies and I know I have not seen them for years.  Fortunately, AMC has been running a lot of Hammer films on Friday night's this year.  Not a scholarly work, &quot;House of Horror&quot; is a treat for fans, not academics.	2001-06-30

Having seen all of the Hammer Dracula movies it is easy for me to understand why Lee felt frustrated in the role.  The character was reduced to being so animalistic; in some films he never even speaks.  This autobiography makes it clear Lee could have done much more with the role (and actually got the chance to do so, but in a film made after this book was published).  Certainly an interesting book for Lee's fans, but hopefully they will end up with more of an appreciation for the man's entire career in acting.	2001-06-30

Don't be confused by the &quot;Vampire Hunter&quot; title, because this is a world where vampires have legal rights and Anita Blake spends more time raising zombies in her job as an Animator than she does staking out the vamps.  In &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; Anita is the target of the Master of the City and it seems her best ally is another vamp named Jean-Claude.  One thing I like about this book is that it feels like you are already in the middle of an epic story, which is exactly the case.  The violence and the horror grow with each book of this series, but you have to begin at the very beginning to enjoy it all.	2001-06-29

If the focus had been more on India Cohen, or even exclusively, this would have been a really first-rate Vampire Slayer novel.  But there ends up being way too much going on in this story.  Then again, one of the things that makes Holder stand out as a writer of Buffy stories is that she continues to use the people and places you creates (e.g., the Ghostroads), so hopefully there will be some more on India down the road.  They already proved in the Spike &amp; Dru novel that stories about past Slayers can work, so let's just keep our fingers crossed on this one.  &quot;The Book of Fours&quot; is not a great Buffy novel, but it is certainly above average.	2001-06-29

Everybody knows people who suck the life blood out of you, who take advantage of your feelings of love or affection and make your life miserable in an attempt to feel better about themselves.  Like the vast majority of self-help books this one tells you things you already know in your mind but tries to give you a kick in the butt to actually have the heart to do something about them.  If you are in a situation where this is happening to you, please give this book a try.  You owe it to yourself.	2000-11-24

Well, trust me, this one is well worth the investment in time and cash.  Golden and Holder are far and away the best writers working on Buffy books and in this entire series they get free reign with the characters and their imagination.  There is also a respect for Buffy and her friends you do not always get in such books.  Let me put it another way: you know how good this series is?  I went out and got a hardback edition because this is a keeper (even if you do not have a gate).	2000-11-24

This is not because you need to learn about the rules for vampires; everybody pretty much knows those already.  But the structure of King's novel is very much modeled on Stoker's classic.  King brings to the story his ability to take the supernatural and place it in the realm of the ordinary world.  In this case it means Maine, which harkens back to the writings of H. P. Lovecraft.  It is interesting to think of New England as being comparable to Eastern Europe in terms of mysticism and things that go bump in the dark.  This is not one of King's better novels, but it is still a good read.  Just remember to read Stoker first.	2000-11-24

But Stoker's vampire novel can still provoke some intriguing classroom discussions over the use of different first person narratives, the elements of horror, and the willinging suspension of disbelief.  Given all the variations on Dracula in films, it may well be worthwhile to talk about the range of interpretation versus being faithful to an author's original vision.  For some classes, this might be worth a shot and Dover makes it economically feasible.	2000-11-12

They do not give in to the sensationalism of their infamous subject, which is a pretty neat trick.  It is hard to think that even without Stoker's novel this is a character who would have been forgotten by history.  After all, you can make the argument that Vlad does in Eastern Europe what El Cid accomplishes in Spain: stops the Muslim invasion of Europe.	2000-11-12

Meanwhile, Jack's gal pal is trying to advance her career through a slick radio star.  Just because Jack is dead does not mean he doesn't have feelings.

My complaint, like so many others, is that the retroactive overlaying of so much eroticism onto the original novel.  There was some, but it was subtle and implied.  Stoker was not writing soft porn.  However, Marie Kiraly is--and without the benefit of the Count himself.  You know what?  This book would have worked a lot better if the story had not involved the title character.  How's that for ironic?	2000-11-05

It is not as clinical as it might be, but it certainly in the grand tradition of such scholarship.  The most interesting parts for fans of vampire literature are the details on the original folk lore beliefs and rituals, most of which are a lot more interesting than the ones made up by Hollywood.

Actually, I figured that particular allusion went over the heads of the vast majority of the Buffy audience.  But it is nice that Joss tosses a bone to us older fans every once in a while.

There are large areas of overlap, obviously, but if you have room on your shelf for more than one such book, by all means, this is a strong second choice.
