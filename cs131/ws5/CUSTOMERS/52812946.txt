Especially for someone like me with a basic understanding this was very helpful.  Hagen sets out the history of Buddhism and with few words spells out how you and I can find peace of mind and gain wisdom through simple practices, and without the need of a \\"guru\\", \\"teacher\\", or \\"spiritual guide\\".  The author has a clear writing style that gets directly to the point without trying to be too cute or complex.  I would recommend this book to any friend.	2004-02-01

He's fascinated with far away places, and the people who live there.  He answers the question I think we've all had when traveling \\"who lives here, why, and what are they like?\\"<br />Halpern takes on his journey from one edge of America to the other visiting small communities at the edge of civilization.  We get to know the people who live in relative danger and seclusion.<br />What I found interesting was that many of the folks he brings us along to meet are more afraid of living in cities than staying in the extreme locations where they've been for years.  Their feeling of stability living in an outwardly unstable environment tells us something about the power of home, the power of place in our lives.<br />Halpern has an easy, flowing writing style that doesn't get in the way of the story and is very readable.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it quickly.  It's been a couple of months now since I finished, and I've found myself thinking back often to the people I met through Halpern, unique people living in unique locations.	2003-09-30

Can one book successfully sum up what's needed for a successful real estate career.....yes. <br />I've been a real estate broker for 11 years and I've been to and heard just about every major \\"real estate trainer\\" out there: Wickman, Buffini, Stumpf, Kennedy, Ferry, Knox, Droz, DeLuca, etc. What they all offer are specifics of how they were successful realtors in their time. Which is really helpful, but what sets this book apart is that Keller looks at the challenge of treating your real estate sales career like a business. There is real wisdom here, not just about having a \\"successful\\" real estate career, but life balance, and personal fulfillment through our real estate business.<br />I know a number of other agents who have read this book and one thing I've heard a few times is \\"I wish something like this was around when I got into the business\\", which are exactly my thoughts. Keller has kind of a tough love approach to spelling out exactly what is involved in true mastery as a realtor producing at a very high level. Another thing I find interesting is that this book could be about any industry, any career. The disciplines and business concepts he describes are universal.<br />Keller starts with the open questions of essentially \\"what would it take for an agent to succeed at a really high level, and let's use a million dollars as a kind of random goal.\\" He then builds with 1) finding the motivation within to climb this mountain, 2) How to earn a million, 3) how to net a million, 4) how to receive a million in passive income (a true business owner), and finally 5) how to put it all together with the key of focus driving your business. <br />Keller has a direct common sense outlook and writing style which I found refreshing.<br />This book applies to the new agent as well as a realtor who is already producing at a high level.	2003-07-17

What impressed me about this book is that it's 1) based on actual research rather than theory, and 2) written in a manner that is very easy to understand and implement.  <br />Loehr's work in the past centered around seeking the source of human capacity - what makes it possible for some people to perform at the highest levels even under extraordinary pressure.  He's noteworthy for having started an institute that has worked over the years with many top athletes including Pete Sampras, Dan Jansen, Mark O'Meara, and Ray \\"Boom Boom\\" Mancini among others.  Schwart's background has involved understanding the nature of wisdom - what constitutes a satisfying, productive and well-lived life.  Together they've developed a model for peak living that combines the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.<br />They state that which is obvious but not followed well by most of us Americans - that without physical energy and health it's impossible to follow the rest of our dreams and ambitions in life.  In the physical realm their analysis specifically of top athletes shows that peak performance involves both a willingness to push the body to the limit, and also hugely importantly regular periods of rest and recovery.  They apply this to the \\"corporate athlete\\" who is their target audience for the book with the following advice - seek out stressful situations that push your range of psychological muscles - AND find time regularly for recovery.  They have specific recommendations for incorporating rest and recovery throughout every day.  They say that in the work world we tend to live linearly - meaning working straight through long days - which results in low energy periods/burnout/unreleased stress/etc.  I completely identified with this section of the book and am going to use many of theirconcepts successfully tested on successful athletes and include them in my business day planning.<br />The book acknowledges that without a personal big \\"why\\" driving what you do in life having physical energy is pointless - with the opposite holding true as well.  Plentiful physical energy without a reason for existence goes nowhere and a crystal clear purpose can't be lived out without ample physical energy to make it happen.  As with all of the book the chapter on spiritual energy is filled with real life examples of people who have been through their institute and whom they've helped develop a game plan for overall life performance.<br />The chapters on emotional and mental energy are really the glue that holds the physical and spiritual together - and are also interesting.  <br />The book finishes with a \\"resource\\" section that includes a summary of the main points they've made, worksheets on connecting with a big purpose and on connecting the small habits (little muscles) into bigger habits and successes (large muscles).<br />A great read - stimulating - thought provoking - and possessing that rarest of information in today's world - some actual wisdom.	2003-06-21

I've come home many days after being enmeshed in our modern world for 10 or more hours and been reminded of the expansiveness and beauty of the natural world that's only a 4 hour drive away from me.  This is a well-written and beautifully photographed book.  I have to admit that I'm fascinated with Nevada.  With the great otherness and open space that is the Silver State.  <br />I learned quite a bit and was entertained by the essays that divide the sections of photos with chapters including: \\"The Meaning of Nevada\\", \\"People and the Land\\", Basin and Range\\", and \\"Prospect and Chance.\\"  There is good history here about Nevada's people and it's geography, helped by quotes from the likes of John Muir, Mark Twain and authors of other Nevada oriented books as well as regular folks who like their home state.  <br />However the real draw is in the photos.  Scenic, evocative, large, well footnoted, just plain beautiful.  I really felt like this is a book crafted by people with a love and appreciation of the place that is Nevada.  As though they wanted to share their passion and knowledge with me.  I also like the simplicity of the look and feel of the book.  There's a frankness and openness that's reminiscent of the state of Nevada itself.<br />Enjoy!	2002-08-24

But there is a lot of meat that will keep you thinking.  Wilson is fascinated with marriage rates over time, across cultures, and among different races - but he's concerned with the plight of children.  His argument of why children do much better in a marriage setting, like all of the book, is heavily documented and well written. <br />His analysis of the sex ratio (number of men per hundred women) I found totally interesting.  The ratio has changed a lot over time because of wars that kill off men - immigration which usually means that more men than women will move to another country - prison populations which draw men out of society - etc.  Wilson looks at how differing sex ratios effect family arrangements like polygyny as well as general sexual behavior between men and women and mating patterns.<br />The author examines the role shame & stigma played in the past in ensuring that marriages last and that families care for their children, and compares that with today's more open attitude towards personal decisions.  \\"Our society has managed to stigmatize stigma so much so that we are reluctant to blame people for any act that does not appear to inflict an immediate and palpable harm on someone else.  We wrongly suppose, I think, that shame is the enemy of personal emancipation when in fact an emancipated man or woman is one for whom inner control is sufficiently powerful to produce inner limits on actions that once were controlled by external forces.  A truly free man or woman is a person whose actions are controlled by gyroscopes rather than opportunities.\\"<br />He has a very even-handed section on the effects of day-care on children involving differing scientific studies.<br />Subchapters include \\"If marriage is good, why is it in trouble?\\", \\"Jealousy\\",  \\"The Effects of Divorce Laws\\", \\"The Shotgun Marriage\\", Does Welfare Cause Dependency\\", and \\"The Victorian Interlude\\" among others.<br />Wilson's bent can be summed up in his words - \\"Family, though the smallest and seemingly most fragile of institutions is proving itself to be humankind's bedrock as well as its fault line.\\"	2002-08-01

It all felt very personal and familiar and made me wonder how many other people would find that these two stories hit close to home.<br />I should mention that I just discovered recently that this is my brothers favorite book (and he's no &quot;phony&quot;).  I wouldn't rate it as my favorite, but I do have an affinity with this text, having now read it twice, once as a teenager and now as a thirtysomething.<br />Salinger describes this work in the preface as &quot;a pretty skimpy looking book&quot;.  It's certainly short, but both stories are funny and addresses how a family - albeit highly dysfunctional by today's pop-psychology standards - deals with issues like death and suicide.<br />I really enjoyed the interplay in the second story between brother and sister Franny and Zooey over big questions like the search for wisdom, being real and losing the ego.	2001-01-10

The Prathers impart some wisdom on the subject of enduring relationships based on their own experiences and those of the many couples they have counseled over the years.<br />The authors take us through the different stages of a marriage and map out what to expect and how to deal with these changes.  They present an excellent strategy for having arguments, and discuss how much people lose out on by choosing divorce.  There is a good chapter on dealing with an affair.  They end with the six promises of a real relationship<br />I felt that almost everything they have to say here rings true.  This is a great roadmap for staying married forever and reaping the rewards of lifelong love and friendship.  They inspire me to have a successful and &quot;real&quot; marriage.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone.	2001-01-04

I made a road trip down highway 395 this past summer through the Eastern Sierra region and this book proved to be an invaluable resource.  It turned me onto many great places to visit off the beaten path.  There is excellent history, wildlife and geological info, and descriptions of the towns along the way.  The photos are just great, making this both a coffee table book and a great visitors guide.  I stopped at the Interagency Visitor Center in Lone Pine (which I would recommend as a good starting point for anyone exploring the area) and among their large selection of books about the region I found this book to the best single source if choosing just one.  You'll be very happy with this purchase.	2001-01-03

I don't know exactly what is different here but the photos look especially vibrant and kind of jumped out at me.  <br />From Antartica, to Cape Cod, to Tahiti, Indonesia and Newport Beach to name a few you'll see all the different elements of beaches around the globe.  I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't love having this book around.  This would also make a great gift.<br />I used to live in Capitola on the sand and looking through this reminded me of all the reason I love the beach.  It's obvious that the authors must have the same passion.  Also the book cover and pages are high quality and physically look and feel great.	2000-12-23

Roberts takes us along on his personal search for answers to the mysteries of the Anasazi through his interviews of leading experts, his camping and hiking expeditions throughout the region, conversations with living Native American Hopi and Navajos, and his research of the modern day archeological history which started with an amateur rancher in the 1880's.<br />I found this a fabulous read.  It's told in an entertaining way, as though we're along for the ride with Roberts as he follows his own curiosity into the world of the Anasazi.<br />I was impressed with how he presented the mysteries surrounding the Anasazi.  He raises many questions which baffle current archeologists, and leaves the final conclusions up to the reader.<br />Roberts also does a good job of bring up different sides of issues such as how much to allow the public into delicate significant sites - what is the proper role of government agencies to balance preservation with access to the public?  Also through his informal interviews he exposes the balance between the archeological practice of digging up bones and pots from ancient sites versus leaving them in their natural state as more of a natural museum.<br />Roberts is a contributing writer for Outside Magazine, has an inherent interest in the Anasazi, and spent years hiking and camping throughout the Four Corners region where the Anasazi lived until about 700 years ago.<br />I had a good time taking this trip with the author through the past and am now encouraged to learn more about the Ancient Ones who inhabited our West for so long before we arrived.	2000-12-23

I always found a smile on my face and a bit of wisdom in my soul.  This is an eloquent, poetic book that I would highly recommend.<br />Muller starts with some history of what the Sabbath has meant in the Jewish and Christian religions and how it has been practiced through the centuries.  But this is not dogmatic reading at all.  The author uses the word Sabbath as a metaphor for rest in our lives - whether it's an actual day, morning ritual, or simply a few moments alone during a busy day.  He reminds us that there is a reason that this Sabbath concept has been such a strong component of life in our past, and warns us against the modern trend towards constant activity.<br />Chapters are filled with personal experiences, stories of others, poems, and suggestions for incorporating mindful rest into our lives.<br />I look forward to rereading this numerous times in the future.	2000-12-23

My skin crawled reading about the brutality and inhumanity he tells us of.  I've heard and read a lot about the concentration camps before, but this first hand experience was very powerful.  Frankl had already developed his psychological theory before the internment, so he tells us how his experiences essentially confirmed his view that humans have a need to find personal meaning.  He recounts numerous stories from the camps of how hope for the future kept him and his comrades alive.  Frankl describes how the prisoners were able to create dreams and plans for the future in order to stay sane and keep their will to live in an environment where it was very easy to give up.  What I got out of his recounting of the horrors of the death camps was that even though the Nazi's took away almost all of the basic human necessities we are used to in life, and brutalized their prisoners, they weren't able to control the minds of those imprisoned.  We each have the ability to control our own thoughts no matter what the situation - this is our power.<br />The second half of the book delves into Frankl's formal psychological theory he terms &quot;Logotherapy&quot;.  He says traditional psychotherapy looks into our past to find cures for current psychological problems.  His Logotherapy on the other hand he says helps people through finding hope for the future by getting in touch with the meaning in their lives. I felt his argument was in some ways simplistic in that he suggests those who are depressed and/or suicidal have lost a personal meaning to life - and that they need to find it.  That much is probably already evident to the suicidal patient - they already know they have nothing to livefor.  Telling them to &quot;go find meaning to your life&quot; is surely good advice, but kind of obvious.  How do you do it? Frankl does have some suggestions however.<br />I felt that overall this was a compelling read that challenges the reader to consider what role personal meaning has in their life.	2000-12-20

Ruiz has an easy writing style that is very accessible and a joy to read numerous times.  <br />This is a book you can finish in an afternoon sitting, yet it's simple truths have the potential to alter profoundly how you view loving relationships as well as your relationship with yourself.  There's a lot here.  I've read this twice and it's spoken directly to me in ways beyond what I can explain in this review.<br />Don Miguel teaches through parable and direct suggestion the transforming power of self-love.  He says that all relationships start with you, and how you feel about yourself.  You will allow just as much abuse and what he calls &quot;emotional poison&quot; as you inflict upon yourself.  A truly loving relationship requires self love - which is so lacking in most of us.  Ruiz compares the ideal relationship to the one we have with out pet - say our dog.  The relationship with our dog is perfect because we get exactly what we expect from our dog.  We never wish that our dog would be better at being a dog, and we love it freely just as it is.  Yet with our mate we tend not to accept them as they are, we expect them to be different, to act in ways they would not naturally act.  Then we are unhappy with them.  We think we are in love with them, but really we're in love with how we want them to be.  He says that we do not truly accept this person we say we love because we don't accept ourselves.<br />Ruiz tell us that humans hunt for love because we don't have it.  We don't have it within ourselves.  We hunt for love from other humans who also don't love themselves and are also on the love hunt.  Then we are surprised and upset that we don't get the love we want from them, and they feel the same.  So true!  Other people don't have the love we need, only we do.<br />Don Miguel ends the book with a guide to healing our &quot;emotional body&quot; and also prayers for ourselves.	2000-12-13

I read this book about a year ago, and still regularly think of it and apply it's concepts in my life and business.<br />I have worked in sales for years, so I am very familiar with the 80/20 concept as relates to business.  Simply stated in my field of real estate it's a proven fact that in different markets of the country and over time 20% of the agents make 80% of the income.  This is true in other types of sales as well.  Of course the flipside of this is that the large 80% of the agents only make 20% of the income.  Basically a small number of people make most of the money.  Why this is has been debated, but it seems to be a consistent rule that holds.<br />Koch points out how 80/20 is seen in other areas.  For example 20% of taxpayers account for 80% of IRS revenue.  What Koch does then is expand this rule to all aspects of life.  He says that the 80/20 rule holds for all kinds of activities.  He says that 20% of your work activity is responsible for 80% of your productivity on the job.  And that 20% of your leisure time is responsible for 80% of your happiness.  When I read this I just knew intuitively that it is true.  So the next step is to figure out what the 20% activities are that are paying off the 80% returns in your work, or personal life, or anything.  And then devote your energy into those activities and receive huge returns.  He says that we're better off focusing on our strong suits where we're most effective rather than focusing our attention on the areas where we think &quot;we need to improve&quot;.  This idea alone is priceless.<br />This is practical, useful material that you can put to use today in your business and personal life.  Koch has some seemingly offbeat ideas about playing with time unconventionally, boosting happiness, productivity through being &quot;intelligent and lazy&quot;, and more that I loved.  It really opened my mind to a range of possibilities.<br />Koch is a successful businessman who says he researched and could findno other books written on this subject.	2000-12-06

Having reread it 14 years later I realize that I was Holden - or am.  The thought patterns, the use of language, being easily annoyed with dumb people, feeling physically ill when confronted with the inhumanity of the world  - it all rang so true for me.  The absurdity of life.  All the &quot;phonies&quot; out there.<br />How can an author capture this feeling that so many young men feel?  It's amazing to me how this story speaks to me in a very personal way, and yet so many other people feel the same way.  Isn't this the story of an outcast?  What does it say about our society when a large percentage of my peers have so much in common with Holden Cauffield?  Is this a timeless story, or one born of 20th century America?<br />I'm going to make a mental note to revisit the world of Holden when I have children of his age.  My parents probably could have benefited from doing the same.<br />There's not much else for me to say that hasn't been said before about Catcher in the Rye.  Writing this does make me question the 5 star ratings I've given other books.  I'd like to give this a 5+.	2000-12-06

He differentiates between true happiness which can permeate a life and fun which is temporary and immediate.  Most all of us say that we seek happiness yet we seldom give it as much real consideration as we do choosing a new kitchen tile.  Prager looks first at what happiness is, then what prevents it, and finally what produces it.  This isn't a fluffy &quot;feel good&quot; read by any stretch.  He says that true happiness is the result of sometimes difficult life decisions.  Chapters include &quot;Happiness is a Moral Obligation&quot;, &quot;Accept Tension&quot;, &quot;Develop Self-control&quot;, &quot;Happiness is a By-product&quot;, &quot;Life is tragic&quot;, &quot;Comparing Ourselves with Others&quot;, and &quot;Seeing Yourself as a Victim&quot; among others.  <br />This material is direct and to the point.  A number of concepts have stuck with me and changed my outlook and behavior.  I see this as a must read for myself numerous times in the future.<br />After buying this book you'll have no excuse not to be happier.<br />(FYI - Reading this book encouraged me to investigate Prager further and I discovered that he is a clear thinker on a range of subjects.........	2000-12-06

I own probably 10 books about the enneagram personality type theory by a number of different authors, and I find Riso and Hudson to be the best experts in the field.  Of their numerous books I find this their finest to date.  It's a revised edition of the 1990 &quot;Understanding the Enneagram&quot; which was itself excellent.<br />This would make a fine introduction yet also has a lot of advanced material.  The book contains a good questionnaire for finding your type, thorough descriptions of each type, insight into the levels of development (which is unique to these authors), practical recommendations, and the spiritual dimensions of the types.<br />Unlike other authors I've read on the subject, I find Riso and Hudson direct and easy to understand.  All in all a very complete and accessible guide to the enneagram.  I've also seen these authors in person and would recommend the experience.	2000-12-06

I read this book about a year ago, and still regularly think of it and apply it's concepts in my life and business.<br />I have worked in sales for years, so I am very familiar with the 80/20 concept as relates to business.  Simply stated in my field of real estate it's a proven fact that in different markets of the country and over time 20% of the agents make 80% of the income.  This is true in other types of sales as well.  Of course the flipside of this is that the large 80% of the agents only make 20% of the income.  Basically a small number of people make most of the money.  Why this is has been debated, but it seems to be a consistent rule that holds.<br />Koch points out how 80/20 is seen in other areas.  For example 20% of taxpayers account for 80% of IRS revenue.  What Koch does then is expand this rule to all aspects of life.  He says that the 80/20 rule holds for all kinds of activities.  He says that 20% of your work activity is responsible for 80% of your productivity on the job.  And that 20% of your leisure time is responsible for 80% of your happiness.  When I read this I just knew intuitively that it is true.  So the next step is to figure out what the 20% activities are that are paying off the 80% returns in your work, or personal life, or anything.  And then devote your energy into those activities and receive huge returns.  He says that we're better off focusing on our strong suits where we're most effective rather than focusing our attention on the areas where we think &quot;we need to improve&quot;.  This idea alone is priceless.<br />This is practical, useful material that you can put to use today in your business and personal life.  Koch has some seemingly offbeat ideas about playing with time unconventionally, boosting happiness, productivity through being &quot;intelligent and lazy&quot;, and more that I loved.  It really opened my mind to a range of possibilities.<br />Koch is a successful businessman who says he researched and could findno other books written on this subject.	2000-12-06

He battled for many years with severe depression, and looked for answers to his life through higher learning before having a complete change of life and finding inner peace and joy through living in the present moment.  He encourages the reader to let go of the ego and brain &quot;noise&quot; and be in the now, which is how he says he lives.  Most all of the &quot;problems&quot; we have in life don't directly effect us in the moment, yet we are controlled and tortured by them he says.  Tolle also makes the case for healing past pain and suffering through simply being fully here now.  Making these changes in our materialistic, image possessed, ego driven society is a challenge indeed, but he would say it's our only way out.  This is truly life changing stuff.	2000-12-04

Southern boy is raised dirt poor by his mother - gains societal approval through attending Harvard and rising to the top of his profession - then comes home to wrestle with his childhood demons.  It helps that he's a corespondent for the New York Times and writes like we all wish we could.  His style is emotional, direct and very real.  Bragg opens himself and his family up completely and we're the better for it.  I'll leave it at that and encourage you to take a trip into Rick's world yourself.	2000-12-04

Hillerman says that we each have a particular, unique calling in life.  He intersperses complex psychological research along with many fascinating mini-biographies of famous people to make his point.  I at times lost track of where he was going, and other times didn't quite agree with his logic, but overall found this a very thought provoking read.  He presents a fine balance between fate and free choice leaning towards the inevitability of much of our lives due to our unique character.  This mindset allows him to shed dignity on those exceptional odd characters in human history who were troubled yet left much behind.  Reading The Soul's Code encouraged me to take up a number of biographies and to see my life more as it's own story, it's own drama, which I'm writing as I go along.  What a powerfully neat way to view human existence.	2000-12-03

It probably didn't take me more than a couple of hours in total to read, but I literally laughed out loud a number of times, and grinned throughout.  His introduction is &quot;This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all....... What follows then, is mainly a list of &quot;don't&quot;s and &quot;not&quot;s, not unlike the Ten Commandments, but without the moral base.&quot;<br />He has 58 short 1-3 page chapters with titles like &quot;If something is boring you, it is probably you,&quot; &quot;The unexamined life lasts longer,&quot; &quot;Just because the person who criticizes you is an idiot doesn't make him wrong,&quot; and &quot;Live in the past, but don't remember too much.&quot;<br />After you're done this is a good book to have around to read to friends, or to pick up when you realize you are taking things too seriously and want to laugh at life.<br />Excerpt: &quot;A long happy life last five minutes.  One would think that this rule would go without stating, but many people actually believe that a long life of uninterrupted happiness is a real possibility.  And they act on this belief!  They change families, careers, the structure of their faces, countries, everything, for no more substantial reason than they recall five minutes of uninterrupted happiness in the past, and now they wish to re-create the moment in perpetuity.  They even convince themselves that the five-minute period they recall was really five years and giddily substitute the exception (bliss) for the rule (confusion, doubt, misery, fear, confusion, and confusion).  Happiness is wonderful, but if you have had more than five consecutive minutes of it, it means you weren't thinking.&quot;	2000-12-03

You'll travel through the galaxy, through time, and through perception looking forward to what comes next.

Take short excerpts of famous writers works that involve debauchery,  have it short enough to read in a couple of days, and market with bright red, white and blue with the word SCREWING on the cover.  Maybe this is an ingenious way to hook regular Joes into reading a little good literature.  In any case it worked for me.	2000-12-03

You should read this	The author presents a fairly straightforward theory of how he's seen compatibility relate to long term marital happiness and stability.  He breaks it down to three areas: practical, sexual and wavelength.  I've thought a lot in the past about the way I relate or don't relate in relationhships, but reading this book I had a number of &quot;aha&quot; moments where I felt like this makes real sense.  I've discussed his ideas with a number of friends and the consensus is he's right on.  The great thing is that after you read this I'll bet you'll feel compelled to talk about these ideas with friends and more importantly your lover.  It's an easy, accessible read that I would see as invaluable to people looking for love or married for years.	2000-12-03

Well, I discovered that the story of moving people and water into the West where humans really have no natural right living is quite entertaining.  Reisner is the perfect storyteller and he permeates this real drama of pure will, deceit, graft, engineering prowess and the pork barrel with a subtle sarcastic wit I could read all day. He makes a real effort to keep his personal views out of the picture and rely on interviews and statistics.  Even though it seems that he likely sees most large water projects as foolhardy and boondoggles he presents both sides - for example highlighting how one of the massive Comubia River dams had the unexpected value of helping us win WWII through power generation.  I read this for a book club and the four of us (all California natives) used it as a springboard for literally hours of conversation.  This should be required reading for anyone who claims to be an informed citizen living in the American West.<br />There is also an excellent PBS companion 4 video series of the same name which I found available at my library (or sold through Amazon.com packaged with Chinatown) which I would HIGHLY recommend.  It adds a lot thorough interviews, footage of a dam failing, and beautiful scenery that lets you appreciate the natural beauty at stake when considering these large water projects.	2000-12-03

Almost all are written many years after the event, allowing some  life perspective on the very complex, all too common experience of divorce.   I found it very refreshing to read men's largely unheard feelings on this  subject.<br />This is a follow up to the editors first compilation titled  &quot;Women on Divorce: A Bedside Companion.&quot;  Why women's essays  about their divorce are a &quot;bedside companion&quot; while men's  feelings on the subject are seen as a second thought and &quot;the other  side of the story&quot; I found telling of the editors mindset and sadly  the prevailing societal notion that women's feelings are valued more than  men's.<br />I noticed that the essays were slanted mostly towards men who led  a life of extreme womanizing and numerous relationships after their  divorces.  This doesn't resonate with my experience of the other divorced  men I know.<br />The editors have put together an interesting read and deserve  credit for acknowledging the experience divorce has on men.  I could easily  have passed on some of the selections, but the following alone I found  worth the cost of the book:<br />- Michael Ventura's &quot;The Ex-Files&quot;  speaks eloquently to the specific loss and guilt that is divorce, and on  the unresolved feelings we carry around.  &quot;Let's not pretend that  divorce is anything but failure... Whether it was reckless or silly or  inspired (or all of the above), it was still important... You hurt others,  you got hurt, and you failed... Of course, failure is not confined to  divorce.  Many a marriage is a walking failure - people joined in a pact  not to know themselves or one another, who try to pull that not-knowing  around themselves like a shield against the world.&quot;<br />-Michael Ryan's  &quot;How to Get Divorced&quot; absolutely killed me.  A completely  sarcastic guide book for how to wreck a marriage.  Example: &quot;If  something about your wife bothers you, speak right up!  There's really no  good reason why your wife can't be better in every way, if only she would  try harder.  Scrutinize her aloud on a daily basis.&quot;  And &quot;Stop  Having Fun!  This is tricky, because you and your wife probably wouldn't  have gotten married in the first place unless you had been having at least  a little fun together.&quot;  But his best advice for ruining your marriage  is &quot;When in doubt, be selfish!&quot;  It allowed me to totally laugh  at  my own divorce and my role in messing up the marriage.<br />-Daniel Asa  Rose has a great essay about the love/hate/grief that he has for his ex,  and how his promiscuity hides the fact that at heart he's a one woman man.	2000-09-15

A quite inventive  concept that made a real impact on me.  I doubt that I read much here that  I didn't already know about the fundamentals of exercise/weight  loss/nutrition/eating habits.  Let's face it, we all know what is and isn't  good for us.  But this book coupled the simple rules of weight loss to the  all important WHY to make the life change needed to allow us to lose excess  pounds and keep them off.<br />Eat less - more healthy food - exercise more -  I know all this.  yet as I sit here today there is some reason I haven't  changed my habits.  The Philosopher's Diet did an excellent job of  rationalizing why I should act differently.<br />Bottom line - this book has  encouraged me to get and stay in the shape I desire much more than anything  else I've run across, probably because it challenges the reader to take the  road less traveled, and I like a challenge.	2000-09-07

I'm a  gen x'er and found it harder to identify, but it still held my interest. He  has an enjoyable style that's witty without being pretentious.<br />Morgan  takes us through his dream assignment of driving a new Porsche Boxter  across the country and through the hard-wired American desire to be seen in  a 'cool' car.<br />He describes the very 20th century mode of viewing our  personal history through the cars we own.  &quot;Back in high school I  drove a 73' Mercury Capri and was dating..........&quot; I don't know if  this is true for others, but I connect chunks of my life with the car I was  driving just as he does.  There were the Audi years, and college days  driving a Honda, etc.<br />Morgan has a great take on the SUVism that  Americans have embraced: &quot;once upon a time the car was going to take  us to our cabin in the woods, now it's become the cabin.&quot;  <br />It seems  we Americans are always seeking a new frontier, and maybe getting in the  car and just driving is the modern equivalent of the Lewis and Clark  ambition in each of us that he speaks to.  Morgan asks where we go when the  frontier is closed, as was declared over 100 years ago.  He poetically  details the rush of the open road, and warns &quot;a lot can go wrong in  the distance to the moon.&quot;<br />He covers a lots of geographical ground  from coast to coast, and has quick insights here and there.  In the end, I  felt there was more he could have done with the concept, but still enjoyed  the book.	2000-08-29
