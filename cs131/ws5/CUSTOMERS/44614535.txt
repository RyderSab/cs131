It was as if Farland wanted to finish the story before anything else happened.  At least he had the courage to give the series some kind of conclusion, unlike some other writers, whom I won't mention.  All in all, disappointed with the result.	2005-05-29

We get the idea of the gunslinger chasing the man in black but we don't know why or for how long.  The story seems to gain some substance as it progresses; the gunslinger meeting the boy Jake and the events on their journey provide some story line to follow.  It is only in the series' suceeding books (the drawing of three, the wastelands) that we get an overall picture of whats happening.  The series is like one big jigsaw; instead of a flowing storyline, the story jumps around from the present to the gunslingers past.  King is one of the few writers who can do this successfully.  Even though I found it hard to follow the first book, the following in the series are excellent and I would definitly recommend them, even though it is necessary to read the first book in order to follow the storyline. A bit of a tough read, but worth it in order to follow the rest of the series.	2003-12-17

It is King's best book to date, a book that you will read over and over again.  It is a mix of horror, romance, and sci-fi, expertly intertwined.  It is a tad bit long alright, but well worth the read. If you havn't read it yet, give it a go; its worth it. (also look for references to this book in the dark tower iv: wizard and glass)	2003-12-12

I'll try to express my opinions of the book without spoiling the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet (I hate it when people do that).<BR>I loved the character development in this book.  We finally see what being a gunslinger really means and Roland, Eddie, Sue and Jake really live up to the title in a gripping ending.  The old style Western feel of the book (with a few differences) really appealed to me also.  King has created a world where things are almost normal, with subtle and some not-so-subtle differences that make this book my favourite of the series.  I could write a lot more but I'd probably give too much away.<BR>And look out for characters from King's other books (I just love the way he interweaves different stories).  Read this book; you will not be disappointed, and keep an eye out for his next in the series, which I hope will be out soon.	2003-11-30

After reading the previous book, Bird of Prey, I had a good background knowledge of some of the characters and the world in which it is set.  The characters are brilliant, so are the plots, the adventures, the intrigue, the love triangles.... the list goes on and on.  If ever a book deserved 5 stars, this is the one.	2003-06-17

Tolkien's The Hobbit	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Delightful	&quot;The Hobbit&quot; has to be one of my favourite books of all time (next to the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series).  It depicts the tale of a young (well, young for a hobbit which is about 50) hobbit which by chance becomes involved in an adventure, which is very un-hobbit like. And though Bilbo Baggins (the hobbit) complains endlessly and wishes to be back in his nice warm hobbit hole, he has the time of his life (well, maybe not the whole time) and forges strong friendships with elves, dwarves, men and wizards.  Artfully written, it is a delightful tale which I will undoubtedly end up reading again and again.	2002-09-16

Even though the ending of this book is OK, there are still to many unanswered questions, too many sub stories to follow.  In his first few books of the series, I enjoyed the plots because they were relatively few and easy to follow.  Now though, there are too many plots and questions; when is the series going to actually approach some sort of ending?  The way things are going, it will take another 9 books, especially if Jordan continues to answer half the questions posed by previous books and introduces more than were answered.  I really wish I could give the book more stars but in good conscience, I can't.	2002-08-19

Smith has written a beautiful, adventerous story about love, greed, death and courage.  It takes place in a few different places, starting in Egypt, moving its way to England and then to Ethiopia. Wilbur Smith created wonderful characters, both lovable and detestable. The basic plot of the story is that a tomb found in Egypt reveals seven scrolls, the last scroll containing cryptic clues to the burial site of an ancient king.  Two people come together, one a woman from Egypt and a man from England, and struggle against the power and corruption of a lunatic multi-millionare to find the burial site and the treasures that lie within.  After reading most of Smiths books to date, I have to say that this is one of my favourite.  I really enjoyed this book.  Read it; you will not be sorry.	2002-02-11

I was suprised when I found this as it was an original book, not based on any of the resident evil games.  I found that this book was excellent, joining together the events in the books resident evil 1 and 2 while also producing a good plot and story to the book. A good follow up and definitely worth reading.	2002-02-07

You find out how to find all the puzzle pieces, find out where the traps are and about the different kinds of monsters. Perry made a great attempt at creating an exciting, adventerous book and for those who love the resident evil games, they will love it even more.  Perry gives the characters some depth and also works outside the game, giving it a unique quality.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys si-fi or just a good read. An excellent book, 5 stars.	2002-02-07

If I could give more I would! This is an entertaining, captivating and imaginative book. Tolkein creates a magical world where you feel that anything can happen (which in all truth could)and the characters he makes are both lovable (Bilbo)and despisable (e.g.Smaug). For people who love fantasy, this is the best in that context that I have ever read, save a few other well known books by the same author. I don't believe that anyone has not heard of Tolkien by now, either because of the movie Lord of the Rings or because of his reputable books. In either case, those who have not read this book (and also The Lord of The Rings series, which is a sequel of sorts to The Hobbit)READ IT NOW!!!Don't be among the minority. You won't regret it, I promise.	2002-02-06

The first book is excellent for a first in a series.  Robert Jordan creates an entirely new and imaginative world with original ideas and captivating plots.  I enjoyed the companionship between the Two Rivers folk the most, especially between Mat, Rand and Perrin, each who think the other two are great with women.  The books that have followed The Eye of the World are good; each book has its own individual climax while still leaving questions unanswered, and each time introducing new characters and new plots.  An excellent book, a must read.	2002-01-22

I thought that after two excellent books that Rowling wouldn't be able to produce another of the same calabre, but she did, and in flying colors too.

I thought, well, I suppose it must be a good childrens book.  As time went by, however, my friends (aged friends!) read it and they were raving about it and recommended that I read it. And so I did.  I can just say that this is one of the very few books that were up to my expectations. It is such an original plot and its amazing how well Rowling conveys the feelings of the characters in the book, Snape with his emmence dislike for poor Harry, Hargrid's kind and gentle nature, despite his physical description, the vindictive nature of Malfoy, Ron's longing to be better than his brothers, and Harry's happiness about finding out he is a wizard.<br />Rowling introduces some delightful idea's into the story, such as the sport Quiddich, which I found highly entertaining, and the rivalry between the four houses at Hogwarts. An excellent read, especially for those young at heart.  For those who read it, it will be one, if not the, most entertaining and delightful books you have ever read.	2001-11-07

King has written an amazing book, not just about the monster that lurks in the sewers, but of friendship and enduring hardship together as a team. The characters in this book are excellently constructed and the world around them, insurpassable.  This will move any reader at heart and wish for a friendship as secure and unbreakable as these seven kids had, and will weep when they see the courage and determination they have.  A definite must read, but be warned, you will be moved by it.	2001-10-17

I might be a little old (so some people say) to read the Harry Potter books but I just couldn't put it down.  I bought the first book about a week before I had bought all four and read them.  Rowling has created an astonishingly real life world and the characters seem so real I got caught up in the whole story and read it like it was real life.  The fourth book is the best of the lot and that is saying a lot.  It is filled with intrigue and plots to resurrect &quot;You Know Who&quot; and to kill our hero Harry Potter.

An excellent view of the war between good and evil, this book is filled with brilliant characters and excellently constructed plots and sub-plots.  Although it was a long book, I never got bored of it and at this stage I have read it twice. <BR>If you have read &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series to date, you would notice that the character Flagg appears in it aswell, and so does the plague, the superflu.  I love the way King intertwines stories this way, another example being the regulators and desperation.<BR>And back to the book in question, I think that anyone who has read any of Kings books, or enjoys reading at all, this is a must read.  Put it at the top of your reading list because it is simply, the best.	2001-10-10

In this book Farland seems to draw out the plots and situations just to fill the book, which is shorter than the other two. Still, I can't be too critical about it as it introduces some enjoyable new characters and uncovers some new and unforseen twists. <br />In this book, Gaborn, still recovering from the diminishing of his Earth Powers, struggles to eradicate the force of reavers that attacked Carris. While this is happening, the girl Averan uncovers a plot of the reavers that could end the world. To stop this, Gaborn must travel to the underworld and confront the one true master, the greatest of all reavers. This book also looks more closly at the characters of Gaborn Raj Aten and we discover much more about them.<br />Even though this book was not up to my expectations, I still thought it was a good book and would recommend anyone who has read the previous books in the series to get this book. For those who havn't read the others, I suggest you do!	2001-04-16

When I first began to read the book, I was disappointed as it was not up to my expectations. So, I stopped reading it after the first chapter and onto the shelf it went. However, later I took it up again and once I got past the first few chapters, I couldn't believe what an amazing book it was. I mentally kicked myself for not reading it sooner.  The overall plot of the book is that this lord, Raj Aten, is intent on taking over all his neighbouring countries and it seems that the only individual who can stop him is a young prince named Gaborn.  The most amazing concept of the whole story is the idea of endownments but I won't go into any more detail on that as it would probably ruin the story. So don't be fooled by the first few chapters; give it a go and you'll thank me!	2001-03-27
