I, however, enjoyed the book but not as much as his other legal thrillers<BR>The King of Torts is Clay Carter, a 31 year old lawyer who has worked in the public defender's office in Washington, D.C.  His newest client is Tequila Watson a young black man who kills another man after leaving a drug rehab center.  The next day Clay is approached by Max Pace who says he represents a drug company that produced a drug that caused Tequila and others to kill.  The company is willing to pay Clay $15 million to bring a $5 million dollar settlement with the murder victims' families. <BR>This case propels Carter into his own law firm, creating a very large venture with many lawyers, paralegals and staff.  The firm continues to grow as other mass tort suits are filed.  Greed is the key and this will eventually bring down the protagonist.<BR>The King of Torts is a good read although some Grisham fans might find it a little disappointing.	2003-02-24

The Cat Who Brought Down the House is the 25th in the series of \\"detective\\" novels written by Lilian Jackson Braun that feature James Qwilleran and his two Siamese Cats, Koko the male feline who aids Qwill in solving the cases and Yum Yum, the female cat.<BR> The action takes place in Moose County, 400 mile of everywhere.  This time Thelma Thackeray returns after nearly a six decade long career in Hollywood.  The octogenarian does not plan on sitting still as she acquires the old opera house and proceeds in opening a film club to screen old movies.  The circumstances are marred by the kidnapping of her Amazon parrots and the suspicious death of her twin brother.<BR> As with the previous Cat Who books all this gets Qwill thinking and Koko doing his \\"thing\\" that gets the case solved. This latest entry is a quick read.  Braun also re-tells two stories from her latest (2001) short story collection, Short and Tall Tales.  If you are a Lilian Jackson Braun fan this book [is]recommended.	2003-02-14

Instead of the danger coming from a mutant microbe it comes from a man-made mutant molecule or nanoparticle, molecule size robots.<BR> Most of the story line takes place in a Nevada test laboratory, Xynos Technology where Jack Forman who wrote the original computer code that made these runaway robots possible, must find a way to confine and eliminate them.<BR> Crichton has, in the past written about genetic engineering (Jurassic Park and The Lost World.  Growing up most of us has seen dinosaur movies and can only wonder if man fooling around with prehistoric DNA could actually achieve this.  In The Prey, we not only wonder but can only think how close to reality can nanopartiles  be engineered and cause all the havoc in Crichton's latest, fast moving, can't put it down thriller.

Mount Vernon Love Story, a biographical novel by suspense, mystery writer Mary Higgins Clark is actually her first novel published in 1969.  It pre-dates all her encounters with murder, mayhem, crime investigations and of course Kay Scarpetta. The work was originally published as Aspire to the Heavens which was George Washington's mother's family motto.<BR> The book begins as Washington is getting ready to leave the Presidency to attend the inauguration of John Adams.  The novel takes place in the present 1797 and is a series of flashbacks following Washington as an army officer in colonial campaigns against the French and Indians in the Ohio valley up to the American Revolution.<BR> Clark tells us of his affection for Sally Carey to Martha Patsy Curtis, the widow with two children he eventually marries.  Martha was called Patsy by her father and of course George. (As Lady Bird Johnson was never called Claudia, the first first lady was never addressed as Martha.) George always called her \\"my dearest Patsy\\" and her referred to him as \\"my old man.\\"<BR> From a historian's point of view Mount Vernon Love Story is an interesting short book. It's not the type of book I would like to see again by this wonderful author.	2002-10-27

Garelick intertwines many fictional characters with real people that played out the horrors of the war. The story involves the lives of seven people as we follow them over a six year period of time as the face the horrors of war, the mass murders of not only European Jewry but all those that were in the way of Hitler's paranoid desire to rid the world of Jews and Untermenschen. <BR> Jews has fought in World War I for Germany and were awarded the Iron Cross. They were an important part of Germany's industrial and financial sector as well as Poland's textile industry. However, due to Hitler's obsession of conquering the Soviet Union he took needed people and sent them to the front lines.  Hitler's attack on Stalingrad was a major tactical error which eventually cost him the war. The loss of an entire tank division attempting to cross a frozen lake was vividly well written. I generally do not read historic novels but after meeting the author and hearing him speak I decided to read the book.<BR> The novel is a page turner. However I did find one technical error in the chapter on Yom Kippur, Garelick states \\"The sun had set. The full moon, the stars and the flickering oil torches gave the scene...\\" There is no full moon on Yom Kippur!  Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, the week before always begins at a new moon. Several days after Yom Kippur is Sukkot which always falls on a full moon.	2002-09-29

There were seven previous  novels, all out-of-print and now available in paperback. &quot;The Thief  Who Couldn't Sleep,&quot; was Block's first Evan Tanner mystery.  We  learn early in this first work Tanner had his sleep center destroyed during  the war and therefore no longer needs to sleep. He spends all of his time  awake that may or may not be to his benefit. Tanner probably never planned  on being a spy but here in our first encounter with him he led a revolution  in Macedonia treks from Ireland to the continent and across Europe to  Turkey in search for missing gold.  Tanner is an interesting character  although not as humorous as Bernie Rhodenbarr in Block's The Burglar who  series or a serious as Matt Scudder in the long standing series with that  New York City based detective. None the less &quot;The Thief who Couldn't  Sleep,&quot; is pleasant to read. I am pleased that the powers-that-be  decided to reprint the entire Evan Tanner series.

The book is exciting as we  go on tour, backstage and into the offices on Music Row in Music City,  Nashville. Read the books and close your eyes as you  &quot;listen&quot; to  Garth's wonderful songs. The author is well versed on the topic having  written four other country bios over the past few years. The major  difference is that she was there for much of this and not only knows Garth  but many of the people involved with him as well.   Some years ago  before this reviewer was into country music he was given two of Garth's CDs  and a video. He was impressed with he video but not owning a CD player had  to play them through his computer. He was hooked and still is. Garth is  number one. The book is great.

I have read all Bernie Rhodenbarr books, the Matt Scudder series the four books in the Affairs of Chip Harrison and several other books. When I saw &quot;Hit Man&quot; on the shelf with other Block  books I had to take it home. I was surprised to find it isn't a novel but a  collection of stories about a hit man. As the title suggests each of the  stories is about a hit man, Keller, who is a paid assassin.  Keller is an  interesting character.  He lives alone in his one-bedroom New York City  apartment except for a short period when her has a live in girl friend and  a dog he acquired after a hit. He never cooks for himself depending on  restaurants and take-out food.  In each adventure Keller receives a call  from someone in White Plains, New York and is off to that upstate community  to get his assignment from the &quot;old man,&quot; through an  intermediary, Dot.  Keller is NOT a hero in the true sense because  after all he is a killer. Nevertheless the character is true Block. I  enjoyed it and found the book was a page-turner because you want to go from  one assignment to the other. At one point I though Block was going to wipe  out this character. However the last story in the book opens the  possibility of more &quot;Hit Man&quot; episodes.

Not unlike her three prior books, the Vince Gill story tells country music fans the of life and times as well as  the ups and downs in the career of the star she selected to research and  write about. The cover of the books states the book is an unauthorized  biography. It's NOT like most unauthorized bios were the writer digs into  the dark corners of the subject's life.  The Vince Gill story truly  reports his career from his high school says up until the present. Vince  has won more CMA awards, 17, than any other country star. He has also won  eleven Grammy awards for his beautiful tenor voice, songwriting skills and  his amazing guitar playing. Jo Sgammato's bio is truly a heartwarming story  of an artist who is considered the nicest guy in Nashville.  Vince Gill  fans owe it to themselves to pick up a copy of this book by a NY York Times  best selling author. The three other country bios are: &quot;A Dream Comes  True, The LeAnn Rimes Story,&quot; &quot;Keepin' it Country. The George  Strait Story,&quot; and &quot;Country's Greatest Duo, the Brooks and Dunn  Story.&quot; I'm looking forward to her fifth bio on whoever that may be.	1999-04-07

The novel is short, under 200 pages. In this story  Tulip Willing is a topless dancer, hence the title. She's a tropical fish  fancier and a biologist who call upon Haig in his capacity as a detective  because he too is a tropical fish expert. Tulip's fish are poisoned and  this leads to the murder of her roommate, Cherry Bounce on the stage of the  Treasure Chest. Chip is sent out to investigate for his boss Haig.    This Chip Harrison novels has the same brand of wit as the others and  similar to Block's &quot;The Burglar Who....&quot; Series featuring Bernie  Rhodenbarr.

Matthew Scudder is Lawrence Block's remarkable private investigator. He's a former NYPD detective who left the force after an accident left a child dead in a crossfire.  But that was years and probably took place sometime  in the past before the first Matt Scudder novel. &quot;The Devil Knows  You're Dead,&quot; is Block's 11th in the series. (As of this writing there  are 13.) This is a fast paced story in which Scudder finds he is asked to  solve the death of a Yuppie lawyer living in an area of Hell's Kitchen.  Matt and his girlfriend Elaine spent an evening and Glenn Holtzmann, the  lawyer, and his wife Lisa.  From the beginning Matt doesn't like Glenn.  Glenn is killed and a homeless vet is arrested and accused of the murdering  Glenn. Scudder is asked to prove that the vet didn't do the crime by his  brother. Of course one thing leads to another as the truth unfolds. The  relationship between Elaine, Matt's girlfriend becomes more serious as they  plan on buying an apartment together. TJ, the streetwise African-American  teen is back assisting Scudder. As I have said in other reviews of Matt  Scudder novels. They are like potato chips. You can't quit after  one.<br />Matthew Scudder is Lawrence Block's remarkable private investigator.  He's a former NYPD detective who left the force after an accident left a  child dead in a crossfire. Because he is unlicensed you can't  &quot;hire&quot; him. Instead he does you a favor by taking your case and  solving the crime. In exchange for the favor the client returns the favor  by giving him some cash. Scudder is recovering alcoholic.   Scudder is  hired to find a missing girl, a would be actress, who came to the Big Apple  from the mid-west. When her parents fail at contacting her they find that  Scudder may be the one to help. He comes highly recommended by a NYPD  police officer that has known Scudder for years. This Block/Scudder  adventure takes us to the dark side of Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen.   All   this makes for excellent reading.  I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;On the  Cutting Edge,&quot; and I am anxious to read the next Matt Scudder novel  sitting by my easy chair.	1998-12-22

A petty thief, Jake  Jablon, known as &quot;the Spinner&quot; because he's always spinning a  silver dollar, is found murdered. Someone crashed in his skull and then  dumped him in The New York's East River. Matt Scudder was hired in advance  by Jablon to find his killer if he is killed. He knew someone was after him  because he was blackmailing three people. Jablon hands Scudder and envelope  containing information on the three. Scudder hides the envelope in his  hotel room with the instructions not to open it until Jablon is dead. When  it becomes known that he was dead Scudder's work begins. He examins the  contents of the envelops and begins to visit all three victims of Jablon's  blackmailing efforts. Scudder himself is in danger. The book makes citing  reading and is very difficult to put down. The book originally appeared in  paperback that makes it difficult to find in my public library system.  After being a success a hard cover version of the book was published with  mystery writer Jonathan Kellerman, another one of my favorite authors  writing an introduction.	1998-12-22

In  &quot;Eight Million Ways to Die,' Scudder has begin to realize being under  the influence is not in his best interests. He has already begun to attend  AA meetings and is trying very hard not to dunk. He isn't always  successful, but at least he is trying.  A prostitute, Kim, comes to Matt  because she wants to get out of the life. She asks him to find and speak to  Chance, her pimp. Matt does and Chance agrees to let Kim off the hook.  However Kim is found dead, slashed to death. Chance, of corurse, is the  prime suspect. He says he didn't do it and hires Scudder to prove his  innocence. In Scudder's search for Kim's killer another prostitute is found  dead, this time an apparent suicide. Chance is also a collector of African  art. Many pieces adorn the walls of &quot;his girls.&quot; Although his  business is to promote young women we can't help not liking him. Block's  knowledge of New York City makes this and his other novels in the series  more interesting to a reader who can actually visualize where he is while  reading. I could not find &quot;Eight Million Ways to Die,&quot; in our  library system and because it has been out of print for sometime equally  difficult locating a copy in bookstores.

He's a former NYPD detective who left the force after an accident left a child dead in a crossfire. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic, attending meetings  of AA. (In earlier books in the Scudder series he's always drinking. In  time he realizes he needs help.) By the time we meet up with him in &quot;A  Long Line of Deadmen,&quot; Scudder has been sober ten years.  In this  novel we learn of a legendary club that consists of 31 men. They meet once  a year until their membership is down to a single member who has the  responsibility of recruiting another thirty men to carry on the tradition  to wait until all but one of them is alive. The group meets for years and  years, considering the new recruits are in the late twenties and thirties.  When members of the club start dyeing at an alarming rate Matt Scudder is  hired by one of the members to investigate. Characters from past Scudder  novels reappear. The ever present Elaine, his call-girl  girl friend have  developed a more permanent relationship. In &quot;A Walk Among the  Tombstones,&quot; Block introduces a streetwise American-American teen that  has street smarts. His only permanent address is his pager. TJ is back and  helps Scudder with the case. TJ reminds me of a black ten year old I knew  many years ago in the South Bronx, intelligent and street wise at the same  time. I guess only God knows what became of him.  I hope Scudder keeps TJ  alive and well and in action in future novels. I enjoyed this Scudder novel  as I did the others in the series.  It's not as fast paced as the other in  the series but does make very well reading. I suggest if you enjoy  &quot;Long Line...&quot; you might want to read the others in the series in  sequence.	1998-12-02

Even though drug dealers are low on Scudder's list  even they deserve justice. Block introduces several new characters, the  Kongs, a pair of teenage hackers who break into the telephone company's  computers and a streetwise African-American kid who goes by the name T.J.  This kid has real spunk is a very likeable character I hope Block and  Scudder keep around for a while. Other characters that have been in past  novels are off to Ireland.  Elaine, Scudder's, call-girl friend who he has  had more than a passing interest in comes center stage as a lover.  Read  one Scudder novel is not unlike eating potato chips.

Matthew Scudder is Lawrence Block's remarkable private investigator. He's a former NYPD detective who left the force after an accident left a child dead in a crossfire. Because he is unlicensed you can't  &quot;hire&quot; him. Instead he does you a favor by taking your case and  solving the crime. In exchange for the favor the client returns the favor  by giving him some cash. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic who attends AA  meetings throughout the book. In earlier Scudder novels Matt is almost  always without a drink in his hands.  I have read most of the Scudder  series to date and fond &quot;A Ticket to the Boneyard,&quot; the best. I  could not put it down. Reading it took priority of everything else I had to  do or should have done.  Scudder is reacquainted with James Leo Motley  sent to prison a dozen years earlier. Motley vowed to get even and kill  Scudder and all his women. Although Scudder is divorced the only woman in  his life is Elaine, a call girl. This doesn't stop Scudder as friends,  acquaintances; the psychotic killer eliminates people he doesn't know.   If you read only one Lawrence Block/Scudder novel, &quot;A Ticket to the  Boneyard,&quot; should be that novel.  An afterthought: Matthew Scudder  is a realistic, likeable character. In the early books we find that after  he left the NYPD he took up drinking and left his wife and two sons. From  time to time she asks Scudder to send more money because &quot;we need  it.&quot; Scudder generally obliges. Although not living with his family  Scudder is not distant from them. He speaks to his boys on the phone and  brings them into the city for a ball game. For some reason that Scudder  doesn't know finds himself visiting churches and leaving a donation,  tithing, ten percent of money recently received from a client. Scudder says  Catholic churches receive donations for than others because they are  generally open at late hours. Although he's not a religious man he finds  peace and solitude in the almost always empty sanctuary he visits.	1998-12-02

Harrison answers an ad which reads  &quot;Resourceful youth wanted to assist detective. Low pay, long hours.  Familiarity with tropical fish helpful but not absolutely necessary.&quot;   Chip answered the ad because he was on the lookout for a job with a future.   Chip believes the death of a girl from an overdose of heroin was murder.  She was one of five rich girls(sisters), four of which die in the novel.  Were they related? Were they all murders? Chip and Haig believe so.  &quot;Five Little Rich Girls,&quot; a short novel, under 150 pages. Is good  but not as exciting as Block's Matt Scudder series or interesting as his  books about Bernie Rhodenbarr, &quot;The Burglar Who...&quot; series.	1998-11-25

After many years of Matt Scudder, unlicensed PI, he has finally become licensed. As Matt, himself puts it he is on his way to becoming respectable and a high-priced detective. &quot;Everybody Dies,&quot; is one of the best  in the series of 14 novels in the series written by one of America's best  detective novelist, Lawrence Block. I have read all the books in the  series, except &quot;In the Midst of Death,&quot; have enjoyed them all  with exception of &quot;Even the Wicked,&quot; and look forward to number  15 when ever its published.  Over the years we follow Scudder from being  an alcoholic with always a drink in hand, through this meetings of AA as a  recovering alcoholic to the present, a sober alcoholic. We live with him as  his relationship with call girl Elaine Mardell, who gives up the  profession, grows. They live together and become a married couple a novel  back. Block introduces TJ, the street wise African-American.  TJ assists  Scudder, at first, and later becomes as disposable as his right arm. By the  close of  &quot;Everybody Dies,&quot; TJ has become Matt and Elaine's  surrogate son. (Matt was married before, divorced and is the father of two  sons, now grown. Friend Mike Ballou can't tell the officials about the two  men who broke into his New Jersey storehouse, the stolen booze and their  murder. Mike enlists Matt to help bury the two on his upstate New York  farm. The two deaths lead to many others as the title suggests and threats  on Matt's life. It's another can't put-it-down suspense novel.  I truly  enjoy reading Lawrence Block. Not only have I read all the books in this  series but the Bernie Rhodenbarr &quot;The Burglar Who...&quot; series as  well. Block has several other series which I will &quot;attack and  devour&quot; next before going on to his stand alone novels. Thank you  Lawrence Block!	1998-11-23

Night after night he goes to the movies. It is here he first meets Ilona who is a principal player in this novel. Lawrence Block must be a Bogart fan as well. This is evident with the dialog, which is reminiscent of Bogart films such as &quot;Casablanca,&quot; New characters are crisp, colorful and convincing. Max Fiddler; a New York can driver appears to pick Bernie up on more than one occasion. (I wonder what the odds are of this happening in NY?)  I hope Fiddler returns in a future book. Old characters from pervious novels are mentioned. Carolyn Kaiser, his best friend who runs the Poodle Parlor, a dog grooming place and Ray Kirschmann the best cop money can buy also play important roles as they have in the past.

Our favorite reoccurring characters, Carolyn Kaiser who runs a dog grooming parlor, and Ray Kirschmann the best cop money can buy also make play their roles as they have in previous &quot;Burglar Who book...&quot; Lawrence Block does an excellent job telling of burglaries, murder and mayhem.  As with other books in this series he does it with a great sense of humor. That's what makes these stories of a burglar who also owns an antiquarian bookshop in New York Greenwich Village fun to read. They are light reading, just right for a cold winter's night in front of a fireplace or a bright summer afternoon at poolside.

Bernie is a loveable cat burglar who has to turn detective to save his own skin after stumbling over a murder. If you read a more recent &quot;Burglar who...&quot; you soon realize Bernie's friend Carolyn is introduced in a later work. His second occupation, that of a Greenwich Village used bookstore owner doesn't take place until later. I generally advocate reading books in a series in sequence to see how reoccurring characters develop.

There are separate chapters on both Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn before they became Brooks and Dunn in 1991. Since then they have cut several CDs, all of which have generated several number one hits.

It falls short. The cats do play a part in the investigation but their role is not as involved as in the past books. Fans of LJB probably will want to read this book.

How well I remember the snow storm in the days of that year traipsing blocks with my grandfather from Morris Avenue to Jerome Avenue in the Bronx to check on his car parked in a gas station lot. The friendship between Rabbi Hirsch and young Michael is heartwarming. Their friendship, Michael working as the Shabbos Goy, the rabbi teaching this 11 year old Irish alter boy Yiddish and Michael teaching him correct English and the in and outs of baseball is captivating.  Terrorized by a local gang of anti-Semitic hoodlums the main characters are caught up in hate and violence that only a miracle can bring to an end. Michael questions why can't his comic book super heroes come to his aid. Instead he conjures up a golem, not unlike the golem of the past century from Poland, which was told to him by his rabbi friend.  There is more. To tell more would ruin the book for you.

The first of eleven  novels in the Peter Decler/Rina Lazarus series, The Ritual Bath, published in 1986, throws the two together for the first time when Decker is assigned to investigate a rape at the mikvah in the Orthodox complex where Rina lives with her two sons, Shumel (Sammy) and Yaakov (Jacob or Jake) . Decker and his partner Marge Dunn are shocked that such a heinous crime could take place at a Yeshiva, Jewtown as the police refer to it. As the novel unfolds and murder comes into play Rina and Peter are drawn to each other. As one would expect their relationship is frowned upon because she's religious, frum, and Peter is considered an outsider. Peter's biological mother was a Jew; but was given up for adoption at birth. Through an adoption agency mix-up he was placed with Baptist parents. He grew up as a Baptist. Magnificent treatment and presentation of Orthodox Jewish lifestyles!

Once again husband Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus are placed in another situation of mystery, murder and mayhem. The two are modern Orthodox Jews. Peter, born a Jew but brought up in a Christian home, met Rina in \\"The Ritual Bath,&quot; Faye's first book. Their courtship continued as Faye's Orthodox husband had leaving her to bring up her two boys. Decker, himself, went through a \\"conversion-learning process\\" in early novels. Their Jewishness is much apart of all the novels. \\"Serpent's Tooth\\" opens in a Los Angles restaurant where a mass murder ensues. Thirteen are dead and scores are wounded. The book is fast-paced, and a usual her characters are very realistic. The interpersonal relationships, Decker, his daughter Cindy, by his first marriage; Faye's two teenage boys by her first marriage; and Peter and Rina's daughter add much to the novel.  There are a number of twists as one would expect in a murder novel but there are some pleasant ones in the personal relationships among the Deckers as well. Of course the horrible crime is solved but Kellerman leaves one open end concerning the family's future housing arrangements.  Next on my reading agenda is her \\"Quality of Mercy\\" written a few years back, but not part of the series. Her 12th book, now in the works, also out of the loop is \\"Moon Music,\\" that will be set in Las Vegas.  Book #13, will bring Decker and Lazarus together again.	1997-11-20

The &quot;Sacrifice of Tamar, not unlike the author's other two books, &quot;Sotah&quot; and &quot;Jepthie's Daughter&quot; takes place in an insular ultra-othrdox community. &quot;Sacrifice of Tamar&quot; centers mainly in Brooklyn and later moves to Isreal. In the opening chapters Tamar is raped by a blackman and later, the same night, has sex with her own husband. She becomes pregnant and is very concerend that the child may be the rapist's. (She keeps the attack a secret from all but her two closest freinds.) Later she is relieved when the baby born to her, a boy, is white. There's is suffuicient foreshadowing to predict some of what that might occur in years to come when her own son marries and his wife is pregnant with his child. Her characters in this book, Hadassah, Jenny and the Klovitzer Rebbie are believeable and likeable characters.  Ragen writes with such authority it's almost as though she has witnessed  much of what occurs in her books as good writers write from experience. The books is out of print and her other two novels are difficult to find in my library system owing to their popularity and not ther scarcity. Having read all three in recent weeks I am looking forward to her 4th, due very soon. Another book, &quot;Romance Reader,&quot; by Pearl Abraham is also about insular Orthodox communites. Although not very well writen it too is worth searching out in your library.	1997-10-15

Once again Ike (female) and Abby (male) are the detective team bent on solving a crime. The detecting pair, TV news producer and director for a TV network, are this time looking for the killer of nine homeless men. Why are each found dead with their faces painted yellow and a tag labeled &quot;U.S.S.R. stuck into thier clothing? Ike and Abby are unique. They are ex husband and wife who zip around New York City streets on rollar-blades.  The book is well researched and written. When I read this one and first novel &quot;Until Death&quot; I couldn't wait for the her next novel in the works. This books deserves the attention of mystery fans.	1997-09-30
US	50919099	R2L2GTQLCOHT5K	0373262191	10781591	Until Death	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great whodunit	I first learned about Until Death while unline several years ago when I was on the same on-line service as the author. I enjoyed the novel from beginning to end. The two main characters, TV news director Abby Abagnarro and his former wife and TV producxer Mary &quot;Ike&quot; Tygart come across a shocking murder of Connie Candela, the show's anchorwomen. She's found at her desk, dressed to kill, or should I say be killed  the medical examiner rules she drowned to death. That's only the beginning. The book is worth searching for in your library or book store.	1997-09-30

This time the TV news director Abby Abagnarro and his ex-wife Ike Tagart are at New York City's Madison Square Garden. They are granted an interview by the Icemaan, a New York Knick player. The Garden floor is pelted with buckshot. The Iceman is dead but not from the gun shots. He has been knifed. There are other  shootings and yet another murder. The two, both Abby and Ike, are bickering as they have in the other two &quot;Until&quot; books. Abby's attitude is bit more flip this time around and that's why I rated it as an &quot;8&quot; as opposed to &quot;9s&quot; on the two precious novels. As with &quot;Unil the End of Time&quot; and &quot;Until Death,&quot; &quot;Until it Hurts&quot; is worth the search for at booksellers and libraries. Get they now, read them and wait for the next &quot;Unil&quot; book which I hope is in the works.	1997-09-30

The author depicts her life and the restrictions imposed on her by her Hasidic parents. She does very little to &quot;hide&quot; the identity of the community where she lived. Although she gives a fictious name to the town, which really is Monsey, New York street names and other places do or did exist when the author lived there. I rate the book as an &quot;8&quot; because it is not a very well writen novel. I'm sure people in the Community who read the book must have had mixed feelings about her and the book	1997-08-04

For those of us who have been RVing and been on the road this grand trek might not seem so unusal. For Marilyn Abraham and her husband Sandy this trek was their introduction to their motor home. It was their first experience. Until they took off that July morning they had never been in an RV before! As the title states, first they quit their jobs, gave up their life in the fast lane and traded everything in for life in a twenty-nine foot Winnie. Some of their experiences we may take for granted. For example the friendliness of people they meet in their travels and at campgrounds was surprimg to them. A good book for all RVers who take to the open raod and might consider being full-timers.	1997-04-13
