I admit, most of Egan's physics and mathematics are way, WAY over my head (come on, how should I imagine n-dimensional cubes, singularities in the 6th dimension,... - no way, Jose!) and I was speed-reading whole 'lecture' passages in the book.    But I enjoyed 'Diaspora' anyway because it's so inventive and unique, simply blows your mind away, and that's even after having read 'Permutation City' where some of the same ideas popped up, too.    A lot of readers comment on the lack of characterisation, but then, we're not really talking about characters in this book are we? The whole cast is sentient software (ok some are based on fleshers (= humans)).<br />I'm looking forward to another Egan!!	2000-09-21

The story is loaded with energy and imagination: Starting with Ruby's description of her own conception in the early 1950's and  ending in the present, with chapter-long footnotes alternating with Ruby's  account flashing back to the tragic-comic catastrophes haunting her family  since WW1.<br />It makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you gape, it  NEVER bores you. The characters are so alive (and some of them are truly  repugnant!), they threaten to jump out of the pages.<br />You have to read the  book quickly or you stand no chance remembering all these brothers, uncles,  sister, aunts and where and when and how they died (almost all of them  do!)<br />Enjoy and hopefully Human Croquet will be just as good!	2000-07-29

This time he throws in a very different kind of alien  presence. I have read Hamilton's short-story collection 'A Second Chance At  Eden' and, judging from the alien technology/biology, it's leading from the  Mandel Universe into the Night's Dawn Universe (Hamilton's monumental  series starting with The Reality Dysfunction).<br />I'm not going to rehash  the storyline, but it's very entertaining, I finished the 600 pages in less  than a week and Greg Mandel says 'No Messing' a lot less often than in the  other books!	2000-07-19

It's not easy to read either! I bought it because the storyline intrigued me: Virtual Reality threating Real Life, Conspiracy, etc.  Unfortunately reading it was less intriguing: The story is broken down into  little pieces, jumping between a confusingly large number of narratives,  often seemingly unconnected. At times the story stalled, meandering around,  without discernable direction, indulging in (admittedly colourful)  descriptions. <br />Two positive points about the book were characterization  and vision. Orlando, !Xabbu and Renie are unique and beautifully realized.  The descriptions of future VR technology is captivating, I was espcecially  fascinated by the Beezle character, the Gel-Vaults and the concept of VR  alternative world-building.<br />Will I read the second installment?

Two are set in WW2, one in the present. All of  them operate on a truly global scale. It must have been tremendously  difficult to write this book and Stephenson has done an awesome job! Once I  found my way into the story, it was a rollercoaste: the suspense keeps  building up and the book is full of action, ideas, strange characters and  historical, geographical and cultural background. This book could have been  your three standard novels: One US Marines in WW2 action-story, one  historical novel about Turing/Enigma/Bletchley Park and one  Cyber/Techno/Finance thriller about building a data-haven in SE Asia and  creating a Virtual Currency. But then, even with three books you would  still be missing the vicious humour of the story: In parts it felt like a  cross between Catch 22 and a Ben Elton novel!	2000-06-16

Good fun reading a novel about a senator fighting through the preliminaries to become presidential candidate for his party and comparing it to the real-life saga of Bush v. Cain!<br />During the first 100 pages I  thought, so old-fashioned: Focus on one character (Kerry Kilcannon) and  provide flash-backs to his childhood (have you noticed, every Irish male at  that stage is an alcoholic and a wifebasher!) and formative years, for the  reader to understand the motivation behind every decision he makes, every  action he takes in his later life.<br />And then the depiction of his  loveaffair with Lara: Just didn't seem like end of twentieth century, too  romantic to be true.<br />I don't understand why the author had to throw in  the storyline of the fanatical pro-lifer, intent on killing Kilcannon. I  didn't think it did anything to enhance the suspense. Maybe because of the  twist in the end...<br />But afterwards, the author concentrated more on  campaign and less on Kilcannon and that's where the book gained momentum:  Journalists hunting for a story that could end Kilcannons race;  Preparations for a TV debate with the other contestant; how to get the  pro-choice votes; how to provide security for the candidate; the relation  between Dick Mason (the incumbent Vice President who of course wants the  Precidency) and Kilcannon.	2000-03-09

Several years ago I read the Grisham novels 'The Pelican Brief' and 'The Firm' and was completely hooked, ripped through one of them in one marathon afternoon reading.<br />Since then I have read 'The Chamber', which I found  more substantial but not as enjoyable as the previous ones, and 'The  Client', which I thought was neither profound nor fun.<br />When I picked up  'The Runaway Jury', I was wondering if it would confirm the downhill trend  of Grisham's writing.<br />It's not as bad as _The Client_, but not top of the  crop either. It is suspenseful enough for me to have missed three tram  stops while reading. It does demonstrate that it's possible to write a  legal thriller without corpses (discounting lung cancer). It does have a  relevant and controversial topic (tobacco legislation) at its core. It does  give some fascinating insights into the courtsystem: Jury selection,  Sequestering, Trial Strategies. It does show, that Grisham writes a smooth  pen.<br />But: The story is very simple and straightforward. Much of the book  is spent in the courtroom, listening to the pro/contra smoking specialists.  The remainder is scheming to influence the jurors. It wasn't enough to keep  me electrified throughout the book. The second half I was just trying to  get to the verdict (and hence missed my stop!). The ending was predictable  and kind of fizzed out.<br />All in all: I'm glad I didn't spend any money on  the book. On the other hand I'm sure that I'll read one of his other books  when I feel like literary junk food again. And just maybe he writes  something like his early books again.	2000-02-22

The first few pages reminded me of a book by Ford, 'The Sportswriter', that I hated: All style, no story.<br />But after the slow beginning, it picked up and I was fascinated by the main character and the so different  societies he moves in.

Legal Tender is suspenseful, funny and well written.<br />Bennie Rosato is a great lead: Resourceful, down to earth and she doesn't loose her sense of humour even  in the hairiest situations: Accused of killing her ex-lover and lawfirm  partner, there's no way she'll let the cops catch her before she solved  that, and some other, murder.<br />Good on her!	2000-01-27

Can't believe he got this past the editors. But after I got used to that, I started enjoying the multiple twists and relentless pace. It's a good, albeit not  very believable story.

It works because both are original in their own way. If Ridley Scott had made his movie 1 to 1 from the book, he would have bored us to death.  The book thrives almost entirely on dialogue (internal and external) and on  description of minutae (just think of the scene with Isidore, the Andys and  the Spider!). PKD is such a great writer, he doesn't need movement to  captivate the reader, he simply creates his dark and surreal world,  populated with reluctant protagonists driven by powers beyond their  control.	1999-06-03

The first 200 pages swept me away: How the first 100 get to Mars and the beginning of their new life.

The first 50 pages I found really hard-going and kind of preachy. I hated the way Card was always finding the pure, good core in every character. I don't think everybody is fundamentally good.

The novel concentrates on four characters, two adolescent sons and their fathers. Like in 'My Name is Asher Lev', Chaim Potok proves to be a  master in character development: Danny's father is one of the most  interesting personalities I have ever encountered in a book, and one of the  most tragic! (I wonder if he could also create a female character?! As in  'Asher Lev', the women stay in the background. Half the book focuses on the  conflict between Danny and his ultra-orthodox father, a few pages get  devoted to the relationship between Danny and his younger brother, but when  Reuven tries to talk about Danny's sister, his answer is: &quot;....Let's  not talk about my sister,...&quot; (p200), and from the mother we only  know, that she has a heart condition.) There are many more parallels to  'Asher Lev': Again we have the conflict between the Orthodox Jewish way of  life and how the more 'Assimilated' (not sure if this is the appropriate  word!?) Jews live. The conflict is mainly religous, but overspills into  politics and escalates when the Zionists succeed in founding Israel.<br />I  don't agree with some of the reviews suggesting that you need to be Jewish  to understand/be interested in the book (If you don't have a clue, like me,  it'll make you more interested).I finished the book in under two days, was  simply glued to it!!

But poor Constantin can't really enjoy all this  affection, as he has to find out who kills all the girls, how to survive  his friendship with Roy Rolkin, how to drink about 3 litres of vodka per  page (more than 400 totally), how to overcome his allergy to V.I. Lenin  (the office-cat who loves fishburgers for breakfast) and who his beloved  Julia really is. I liked the book for it's surprising twists, the multitude  of characters and the setting in post-war Russia of 2015. Downsides are  some implausible story- and character developments, and sometimes the  language: It's in 1st person and like: &quot;Believe me, brothers, I didn't  always look like this&quot; (p1). The 'brothers' bit is repeated on nearly  every page!	1999-04-03
