I thought it was going to be difficult to read and comprehend but infact, it wasn't at all.  The lives between three main characters and several sub characters is fantastic.  You get the life stories from everyone.  It was magnificent.	2004-10-17

From that point on, I have become a fan and love the Dark Tower series. <br /> <br />Song of Susannah is again, another fantastic story in the seeking of the Dark Tower.  It is so close to the end of the long epic, but  a lot has to be done.  I hate how these books have cliff hanger endings but I can't wait to feast my eyes on the 7th novel.	2004-08-29

I had a lovely time reading it and couldn't stop reading.  I love Christy's enthusiasm in the small mountain town.  All the characters were constructed very nicely.  It inspired me to watch the television show.<BR>The only problem however, was all the preaching and the finding of god.  I found myself skipping the parts about the Bible and what not.<BR>Other than that, it was a very very very good book.	2004-05-02

Mr. Koontz did a fabulous job depicting characters and a very psychotic situation.  I went crazy and couldn't put the book down because the suspense from page one just keeps building up and building up.  You have inklings of what is happening, only you aren't positive.  The reader doesn't get the whole picture until the last 5 or 6 chapters of the novel.<br />Melanie, the 6 year old girl was abducted by Lauras husband (Melanie's mother).  Melanie's father puts Melanie through painful and pshychologically damaging experiments in order to perfect a specific phsychogeist state.  The Door to december is chilling and people are getting brutally murdered.  <br />This novel was by far the most suspensful book I have ever read.  I absolutely loved it.	2004-04-26
US	40558735	R2ZRXKPKCUEZIU	006092988X	892654736	A Tree Grows in Brooklyn	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Classic	This book was quite good.  This book was only on my reading list since my senior year in high school.  I am a freshman in college and have finally read this lovely peice of literature.  Betty Smith portrays a beautiful life of Francie Nolan and her growing up in Brooklyn.  Her family-Johnny and Katie (her parental units), Laurie and Neely (her sister and brother), Sissy and Eva (her aunts) all help build the pages of this book with a since of character and wit.  The simplicity in this book is fantastic.  I'm not very good at summarizing but basically it is about Francie and her family through out a period of over a decade in New York.  Francie's family is poor, yet they are one of the purest families out there.  I especially loved &quot;Book One&quot;, this section made me feel like a  kid again.  I loved Betty Smith's descriptions of the weekends, and collecting &quot;junk&quot; and the pictures of the candy stores and library in my mind.  It is a classic indeed and recomend it to anyone.	2004-04-20

I am now a freshman in college and continue to purchase and read every single V.C. Andrews book that is published.  This book was definitely a classic V.C. Andrews book chock full of death, rape and being housebound with odd family members.  It was quite predictable but I was kept entertained.  Unlike the other series, this book portrays quite a different family.  Usually the heroine of the novel goes through highschool meeting the love of her life, however, in this book that does not happen.<BR>Celeste is housebound and imprisoned by a mother who is obsessed with supernatural powers.  She can't go to highschool because she has to stay at home, resembling her dead twin brother.  Honestly, I can't wait until \\"Black Cat\\" comes out because I'm curious what is going to happen to the new arrival third member of the party.	2004-04-16

I read the exerpt and bought the book.  This was the first book of this particular topic that I read, and I must say, bravo!  It captivates life as it was right after the Korean war between young Korean women and American GI's.  It depicts the life of  Hyun Jin and her friend Sookie, and the boy Lobetto and how there lives take place from childhood up until early 20's.  The time line of the book begins when the three are youngins and their lives eventually go seperate ways.  The book portrays life as Korean &quot;prostitutes&quot; as you may call them evolve.  The Hyun Jin and Sookie want to make it to America and the path along the way takes several intersting turns and halts.  There are rapes, beatings, friendship, relationships, family, and the brining of life.	2004-04-13

Judging by previous reviews people did not like the book at all.  I rather enjoyed it.  It was simple but the characters were well made.  I have never read a book with an Iranian character before and it was a learning experience.  The story is a tale about a house wrongfully sold to an Iran man.  It's a story of freedom and strong will.  There are some turns in this book that I did not expect at all.  But I thought it was good enough to recomend to  some of my reader friends.

It is because compared to the other three books I have read (Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Choke), this one was not as good.  It does have a psycho plot.  You have to keep reading this book because the plot and what is happening is at the tip of your toungue but you just can't grasp it until you finish the book.  I read it in one sitting.

It was very very good.  &quot;Lucky&quot; on the other hand was even more shocking.  Not only was it mor vividly depicted but it was real.  The first chapter is gruesome.  Sebold depicts her experiences so well that it paints horrible images in your head.<BR>The story however does have happy endings.  But you are left feeling eerie and having a sense of relief.

First of all the whole concept of a book with a spelling bee is brilliant.

Not only does this reveal who Eliza is but it unwravels a story about eahc of her family members: Mariam-mother, Saul-father, and Aaron-brother.<BR>This book took me back and I had to reread a lot of pages just to make sure I was taking in what was really happen.

At first I was skeptical because the first few chapters just went on and on and on with not all that much going on.  But as the book went along it started coming together.<br />One of the things I really admired about the book was the detail.  Ms. Kingsolver depicted these beautiful scenes using so much vivid detail it felt like you were there watching it all happen.<br />The book is basically has three stories.  One about Deanna whom is a ranger living in the mountains.  She is a strong-willed nature loving woman.  She has kept to herself on this  mountainside for two years when all of a sudden she meets a young male  (Eddie Bondo).  Their relationships buds and her life becomes topsy-turvy.<br />The Second story is about a young woman named Lusa whom is widowed and left with a farm to take care of and in-laws that don't know what to think about her.  She tries to find a new way of bringing in money and decides to raise goats...read the book if you want to know the whole story.<br />The third story is about an old man named Garnette who is trying to make the come back of old Chestnut Trees.  This is the most quirky story because he also has a small war with his neighbor Nannie-their personalities clash but then it all works out in the end.<br />I couldn't imagine how these three stories could possibly weave together but they did flawlessly.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It would make an excellent movie.	2003-05-27

Basically it is Dr. DeBeers journal about his life in his medical center and his falling in love with Willows mother.  I wasn't that intrigued by it but it kept my attention enough to allow me to keep reading...and it was a quick read too.   It had a fast paced story line. <br />I am a huge fan of the V.C.

I admit it did become quite predictable but the story line kept me wanting to read on.  <br />The story is about a boy named Stanley Yelnats (notice the name...look closely) around 13 whom is wrongly accused of steeling a pair of famous shoes.  His sentence leads him to Camp Green Lake where there isn't a lake at all...just a vast area of dry desert like sand.  His punishment is to dig holes, and dig holes and dig holes to \\"straighten him out\\".  <br />The story is clever because it jumps back and forth between two story lines.  One about the present and how Stanley survives along with his friends and the short curcuited leaders, and the other is a tale of the past.<br />Everything is linked together and fits like a glove at the end.  I started reading and could not put this book down.  It is fun for all ages...and I am now officially dieing to see the movie!	2003-05-06

'Ny is the bestest guy ever!  Not only have I read this book over 50 times, I never tire of it and I crack up everysingle time.  This is deffinately not for the conservative mind.  You need a sense of humor and an open minded stature to love this book.  Oh my god it is so darn good!!!  I recomend this to all.	2003-02-16

US	40558735	R1AO3MTT4XK3OQ	0446670251	437057713	The Virgin Suicides	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Lovely	This is a brilliant story about a family consisting of daughters.  The Lesbon girls are famous among the neiborhood boys.  The story is based on the lives of the young beauties and how the guys try to decode their habitual lifestyles.  The story ends with all committing suicide.  <br />What a fantastic read.  I could not put it down.  The movie is fantastic although like most made from books movies it doesn not hold all the minor details tha make the story that much more important.	2003-02-03

I admit this series has not been the best but that would never stop me from reading any of her books.  I will deffinately read all that are to come, I just hope they aren't as dissapointing as the DeBeers series has been.  Out of the four books, this one is the best one.  It's story plot is a classic V.C. Andrews story minus the romance, and the main character goes crazy which was a little different.  Like I said this won't stop me from reading more books.  I do hope they keep coming because as long as they are published I will purchase and read.  I incredibly hope that they are better in the future.	2003-02-02
US	40558735	R32FFLICVL1CQ2	0393312836	483124263	A Clockwork Orange	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Tasty	This book was utterly amazing.  I admit I was a bit uneasy to read of the violent happenings that happen in the first two chapters.  I was not expecting such quick -paced situations.  But it keeps happening and I couldn't help but get intrigued with the whole thing.  My heart was beating the whole time.  Anthony Burgees paints such vivid pictures of what is happening I found myself wanting to stop and catch my breath.  This is deffinately not a book for those who have dainty lifestyles.  It is quite violent and disturbing...which are books I love!	2003-02-02
