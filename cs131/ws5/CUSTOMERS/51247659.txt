I agree with everything the previous reviewer from Yorba Linda said, so I'll make this review short.  I also carry this pocket-size book with me on all my desert hikes, and aside from being lightweight it also happens to be the most useful book I know of for quick and easy identification of desert trees (some of which look very similar to each other and would be hard to identify without a book like this).  For example, on my last hike in northwest Arizona where I live, I was able to use this book to easily distinguish the canotia crucifixion-thorn from the other two common crucifixion-thorns and other similar-appearing trees such as the smokethorn.  If you carry this little book around with you long enough, eventually all the desert trees will start seeming like old familiar friends.  And you can't beat the price either!	2005-04-08

The author, Daisaku Ikeda, is knowledgable and very enthusiastic about the subject, and his respect and admiration for the early pioneers of Chinese Buddhism are contagious.    The reader should be aware, however, that, as the president of Soka Gakkai International (affiliated with the Nichiren Sect in Japan) the author has intentionally limited the scope of this book to those facets of Chinese Buddhist history that have particular relevance to the later development of the Nichiren Sect.  To his credit, he is quite forthright about this, and openly states it in various contexts throughout the book.  Thus, while this book is very informative in the topics that it does cover, the focus is mainly on the development of the T'ien-t'ai School and the study and practice of the Lotus Sutra --- and there is no mention at all of the Pure Land School, and only passing reference to other schools such as Ch'an (Zen), Hua-yen, Esoteric Buddhism, and so on, which were also important in the history of Chinese Buddhism.  (This limited scope is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5.)    This fact, however, should by no means limit interest in this book to T'ien-t'ai scholars or followers of the Japanese Nichiren Sect.  It simply means that it should be read in conjunction with a broader survey of Chinese Buddhism.  \\"The Flower of Chinese Buddhism\\" has some real strengths, in particular its descriptions of the period when the Buddhist scriptures were being translated into Chinese by masters such as Kumarajiva, the travels to Central Asia and India of Chinese pilgrims such as Fa-shien and Hsuang-tsang, and the early attempts to classify and understand the vast (and sometimes contradictory) treasury of Buddhist scriptures that came flowing into China across the Silk Road over several centuries.  Another strength is the discussionof the factors behind the persecutions of Buddhism that occurred several times in the course of Chinese history.    Despite its slightly narrow focus, the material that has been selected for in-depth coverage in this book is so well-written and informative that I'd strongly recommend it to anyone interested in one of the great spiritual and cultural encounters in world history: the remarkable story of the transmission of Buddhism from India to China.	2004-08-23

Centered around an adventurous trip through Death Valley by two women in the 1920s, it gives a fascinating glimpse into the region and some of its eccentric inhabitants before it became a National Park and popular tourist destination.  The book was written at a time when real American wilderness was beginning to disappear, and the deserts were first coming to be appreciated for their remoteness and solitude and austere beauty, rather than as simply wastelands to be exploited for mineral resources.  Edna Brush Perkins, along with a few other desert pioneers like Mary Austen and John Van Dyke, was among the first to contribute to a greater understanding and appreciation of the great American deserts.  Aside from its historical significance, though, the book is well written and is sure to be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in this harsh but fascinating region.	2004-05-07

Beale's Wagon Road, which followed the route that was later to become the famous Route 66 across the Southwest (generally followed now by Interstate 40), was actually a faster and safer route to California than the much more popular Gila Trail to the south through Apache territory --- but it was avoided by most emigrant parties after news spread of the tragedy that befell the first party that attempted to follow it.  Although almost forgotten now, the disaster was so notorious at the time that it wasn't until the opening of a railroad along the route, followed by the development of the automobile, that this historic road became widely used.<br />That ill-fated journey by the Rose-Baley wagon party is the subject of this book, along with useful background information on  the Hualapai and Mojave Indians, the Santa Fe Trail, and the Sitgreaves, Whipple, Aubry, and Beale surveying expeditions across northern Arizona in the 1850s.  This is a pioneering work on an important but largely forgotten event in the history of the westward migration in the 19th century, and it is surely the definitive work on the subject to this point.	2004-04-04

Together with the classic novel of late 19th century Mohave life, Crazy Weather, by Charles McNichols, it provides a strong sense of Mohave tradition and culture.<br />One of the unique features of Mohave stories (and Mohave life in general) is the central role played by dreams.  As it says in the preface to this book:  &quot;The Mohave clings to his belief in dreams as a basis for everyday life.  Not only all shamanistic power, but all myths, songs, bravery, fortune in battle, and good fortune in gambling derive from dreams.  Every special event is dreamed.  Knowledge is not a thing to be learned, a Mohave will say, but something to be acquired by each person through his dreaming.... Dreams, then, are the foundation of Mohave life.  Dreams are always stated as if they had been cast in mythological modes.  In no other tribes are activities so controlled by this psychic state.  In no other Indian culture is daily life so completely reflected in myths and songs.&quot;<br />Some of the stories are legendary and illustrate the Mohave concepts of their relationship with nature, while others are based on actual historical events, such as an ill-fated raid by the Mohave and Apaches on the Pimas to the south.<br />If you're interested in Mohave traditions, American Indian cultures in general, or in the region of the lower Colorado River and its history and cultures, I think you'll appreciate this book.	2004-03-17

This is an excellent basic introduction to the geology of the Grand Canyon, with a preliminary background summary that places it in the context of plate tectonics, the movement of the North American continent northward from the equator through the Paleozoic Era, and the other major geologic forces that provided a backdrop for the deposition of the layers of sandstone, limestone and shale that we see today.  Among its strong features are the imaginative illustrations that show the depositional environments through the geologic periods in which the various rock formations were laid down. The illustrations provide strong visual associations for learning the rock layers (Kaibab Formation, Coconino Sandstone, Redwall Limestone, etc.) that comprise the Grand Canyon.  This isn't an advanced textbook, however, and someone looking for that would likely be disappointed.  That doesn't mean that it's strictly for beginners, though.  Even someone with a good background in Grand Canyon geology would appreciate the way this book ties everything together in a coherent and well-illustrated overview.	2003-10-28

The book lived up to my hopes in both of those respects, but what surprised me was how absorbed I became in the story itself.  On one level, it's a simple adventure story involving South Boy (who's actually white but was partially raised by Mojaves and was given that name by them) and his best friend Havec (a Mojave) as they travel up the Colorado River into Piute territory --- and in some places it almost reminded me of Huck Finn travelling along the Mississippi with the runaway slave, Jim, and meeting an assortment of characters along the way.  On another level, though, it's really about the challenges of truly understanding another culture and way of thinking --- and in the end the pull of their respective societies is too strong and the two friends inevitably have to part and follow their separate destinies.<br />The author seems quite knowledgable about Mojave culture and history, as I've confirmed from subsequent readings on the subject.  If you're interested in the American Southwest, the Colorado River, native American cultures, or just a good story, I think you'll enjoy this book.	2003-05-12

Like some of the other reviewers, I don't read Pali, and it's probably true that this isn't the most literal translation. However, I've read several translations of the Dhammapada and this has been my favorite for a long time.  In any translation of a poetic nature, the translator must choose a certain balance between a strictly literal translation of the source material and a poetic rendering of the material in the target language, and Mascaro leans a little toward the latter.  I've been a student of Buddhism for some years, though, and I find very few places where Mascaro's translation seems to be inaccurate --- even though there are other translations that may be a little more precise and literal.  In any case, there are many Buddhist philosophical works where precision of terminology is critical, but, since the Dhammapada is a more general work consisting mainly of aphorisms,   it's one work where a little poetic license seems acceptable.	2003-02-11

Well illustrated (with black-and-photographs), it provides a lot of interesting information on their evolutionary background, habitat and range, physical features (including some things that surprised me, although I live near pronghorn and thought I knew a little about them), herd behavior, and so on.  Even though it's actually a &quot;children's book&quot; (apparently aimed at about the junior high or early high school level), most adults would probably find it a very informative and interesting introduction.  I'm an adult who's interested in pronghorns and I have a couple of other books about them as well, but I think &quot;Wonders of the Pronghorn&quot; actually gives the best introduction without getting either too simplistic or too technical.	2003-01-24

There are plenty of anecdotes that bring their songs to life for me in a new way.  Just to take one example, the first song on the first disk of the 5-CD set &quot;Django Reinhardt: The Classic Early Recordings in Chronological Order&quot; (which I'd highly recommend, by the way) is a popular song that was new at the time, called &quot;I Saw Stars.&quot;  It's a nice little tune, with some great solos by both Reinhardt and Grappelli, but I learned from this biography that the newly-formed quintet had never played it before.  They were on their way to their first-ever recording, and were concerned that their music might not be commercial enough to be accepted, and Grappelli had just obtained a copy of the sheet music for &quot;I Saw Stars&quot; (which was a popular hit in the U.S. at the time).  They went over it a couple of times in the taxi on the way to the studio, stopping along the way to pick up vocalist Bert Marshal, who Reinhardt thought might give the group a more commercial sound.  (In later recordings, the QHCF rarely used vocalists.)  To listen anew to the recording knowing now that they were just improvising on a song they'd never even played before just brings home all the more how intensely talented these musicians were.  This biography is full of similar examples, as well as filling the reader in on Reinhardt's early background and musical studies while travelling on gypsy caravans as a boy, and on his teen years spent backing up &quot;musette&quot; dance musicians in Paris cabarets and so on.  All in all, I'd say that if you're a fan of the great Django Reinhardt's music, this biography will enhance your appreciation of it all the more.  (The author, Charles Delaunay, by the way, was a French music critc and contemporary of Reinhardt and Grappelli, who was instrumental in getting their professional careers started and who probably knew them and their music as well as or better than anyone.  So this is as authoritative a biography of Django Reinhardt as there is ever likely to be.)ic, this biography will enhance your appreciation of it all the more.

The hikes are very well chosen, and not only have geologic interest but are enjoyable and scenic hikes in their own right.  Some of them are classics (such as the South Kaibab Trail in the Grand Canyon, the Peralta Trail in the Superstitions, the Heart of Rocks Trail in the Chiricahuas, and so on) that many Arizona hikers will already be familiar with, and the detailed information in this book lets you experience them in a whole new way.  There are also some less-well-known trails that I'm looking forward to trying.  On some of the trails that I'd already hiked, this book answered questions about things that I'd seen along the way and wondered about.  If you do any hiking in Arizona and have any interest or curiousity at all about the geologic features that you're passing through, then this book will be one of the best purchases you could make, and will pay for itself many times over in all the knowledge and enjoyment you'll get out of it.	2002-02-21

It picks up where Lewis and Clark left off, with Colter's  and Drouillard's trips back up the Missouri River for trapping and further  explorations in Blackfeet country, and continues through the great period  of exploration and mapping of the American West leading up to the Mexican  War and the California gold rush.  This book has given me a whole new  perspective on the history and geography of the West.  I see that one  reviewer found it a bit dry, but I think it depends on what you're looking  for.  If you want a collection of &quot;wild west tales&quot; of legendary  mountain man exploits, you may be a little disappointed (although there  actually are a few of those too), but if you'd like a deeper understanding  of the geography and early history of the West, and a compelling picture of  the Rocky Mountain region, the Pacific Coast, the Great Basin and the  Desert Southwest before they were transformed by large-scale emigrant  migrations, you'll love this book.  I could hardly put it down.  Utley does  a great job of weaving the stories of individual mountain men together into  a story of exploration and discovery that reads like a novel, and the  excellent maps make it easy to follow the routes and place names.	2000-04-13

Personally I think it could have been even more interesting if Roberts had  started earlier in Apache history and included the Apache interactions with  the Spaniards, Pueblo Indians, and so on.  Roberts would be the ideal  author to incorporate that early history, as some of his other writings  (such as &quot;In Search of the Old Ones&quot;) demonstrate his interest  and expertise in the ancient Indian civilations of the Southwest and  Mexico.  In any case, anyone who wishes to learn more about the late 19th  century Apache conflicts and the personalities involved will certainly  appreciate the scholarship and flowing writing style of this book.  And the  comprehensive bibliography provides plenty of leads for those who may wish  to read the original source materials.  After finishing this book I was  inspired to revisit some of the sites in southeastern Arizona such as  Cochise Stronghold, the Chiricahua Mountains and Fort Bowie, and they came  to life for me in a way they never had before.	2000-04-07

Alan Wallace and Sangye Khandro.  It's divided into three parts, titled  &quot;Transformation,&quot; &quot;Dream Yoga&quot; and  &quot;Meditation,&quot; and each of these three parts consists of a  &quot;root text&quot; by a renowned Tibetan author and a commentary by  Gyatrul Rinpoche.  The first root text is a wonderful &quot;lojong&quot;  (mind training) text called &quot;Transforming Felicity and Adversity into  the Spiritual Path,&quot; by Jigme Tenpe Nyima.  The second is a dream yoga  text called &quot;Releasing Oneself from Essential Delusion,&quot; by  Lochen Dharma Shri, and the third is a Dzogchen text called &quot;The  Illumination of Primordial Wisdom,&quot; by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche.  Taken  together, these three texts and their lucid and practical commentaries give  a very complete introduction to the essential teachings of the Nyingma  tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, and will be a great treasure for anyone  interest in practicing these profound methods.	2000-03-23

Because Chopra takes a  fresh approach and does not follow any particular dogma, some may have a  bit of a knee-jerk response and write him off as &quot;New Age.&quot; The  search for a deeper understanding of God, however, is as old as humankind  itself, and hardly started with the &quot;New Age&quot; movement in the  modern world.  Hinduism and Christianity are two of the world's great  religions, and each has contributed great insights to that ancient search.   Anyone with a true spiritual motivation will be able to recognize certain  universal religious truths revealed in other religions besides their own,  even though there may be many differences in terms of methods, traditions,  and so on.  I'm a bit sorry to see the reviews for this thoughtful book  become a forum for aggressive assertions of the superiority of one religion  over another.  There's no problem whatsoever with the basic teachings of  either Hinduism or Christianity, but the problem is the growing tendency  toward fundamentalism in both of those religions.  With a fundamentalist  viewpoint, one sees only the outer form of one's own and other religions,  and completely loses the insight into the deeper underlying truths.  That  seems to be the source of some of the attacks on this book, whereas,  ironically, this book itself is a very helpful antidote to that type of  closed-minded thinking.	2000-03-15

Yoshikawa's novel is based  on the Heike Monogatari (Tale of the Heike), which is a classic of Japanese  literature and one of the best historical sources of the late Heian Period  in Japan.  &quot;Heike Story&quot; remains true to the history but fleshes  it out in a way that brings the historical characters to life.  The  translation seemed fine to me, and I'd recommend this book to anyone  interested in Japanese history and culture, and especially the late Heian  and early Kamakura Periods.	2000-03-02

Today this land includes not only the various regions of India, but also Nepal,  Pakistan, and Afghanistan, and &quot;Holy Places of the Buddha&quot;  includes all of them.  Each site is given a full description, including its  place in Buddhist history and its condition today, and much of the text is  accompanied by helpful maps and photographs.  It would take a very long  review just to list the many sites that are covered.  The real value of  this book is in providing a background understanding of the Buddhist holy  places, but separate guidebooks (such as the Lonely Planet guides) will be  required for instructions on how to get to each place.  For anyone  interested in Buddhism or South Asian history, and especially for anyone  interested in making a pilgrimage to any of the sacred and historic places  of Buddhism, I can't recommend this book highly enough.	1999-12-26

This is not entirely his fault, because it's a weakness inherent in attacking science from a religious standpoint.  Of course, as is often  pointed out, the theory of evolution is simply that --- a theory, which is  constantly subject to revision as new facts come to light.  But this is  precisely the difference between scientific theory and religious doctrine:  The scientist (in principle, at least) starts with an open mind and feels  free to modify his or her theories as new facts emerge, whereas an author  like Johnson starts out with his mind made up and shoehorns the facts to  make them fit his position.  Ironically, in light of the title of this  book, it's Johnson who is unable to maintain an open mind.  This is not in  any way to suggest that religious &quot;truths&quot; are less meaningful  than scientific &quot;truths.&quot;  In fact it could be argued that it is  religion which points to the ultimate truth, beyond the realm of the  senses, whereas science is limited to the relative truth, i.e., that which  can be empirically observed and quantified.  In my opinion Johnson actually  trivializes religion by implying that religious insights can have no real  value unless they can be proven scientifically.  In any case, this will  always be a futile endeavor, because the real purpose of religion is  different from that of science.  In trying to discredit the theory of  evolution because he apparently sees it in opposition to his personal  religious views, Johnson is forced to focus on just those facts which  support his opinions and to disregard the rest.  This hardly satisfies the  definition of an &quot;open mind.&quot;	1999-12-24

This should be a must-read for  anyone who loves the Southwest and cares about its future.  At the same  time, I have to say I agree with some of the comments by other reviewers  about how he sometimes seems to be much more aware of how others impact the  pristine wilderness areas than of how he does so himself.  After reading  his biting observations in the &quot;Down the River&quot; chapter about  campers who left an old shoe in a spring and a dirty sock hanging from a  bush, I was a little taken aback when he started the next chapter with the  following story:  &quot;On the way we stopped off briefly to roll an old  tire into the Grand Canyon. While watching the tire bounce over tall pine  trees, tear hell out of a mule train and disappear with a final grand leap  into the inner gorge...&quot;  Then on to the next adventure, with no  further mention of the poor mule train or of the tire which will probably  be there for hundreds of years longer than will the old shoe and sock. What  makes that attitude even harder to understand is his obvious deep love for  the natural beauty and wildness of the region.  At times his lyrical  reflections almost pass into the realm of the mystical and sublime, such as  during his journey through the doomed Glen Canyon.  Despite the occasional  contradictions, this book is a classic, and I would strongly recommend it  to anyone with an interest in the Southwest.	1999-12-24

I must admit that I agree with the Amazon.com review that notes  the &quot;occasional... creeping pedantry,&quot; but perhaps that's  inevitable in a work like this.  The writing style and appreciation of the  details of nature can sometimes call to mind Thoreau (or perhaps Barry  Lopez or Annie Dillard), but at heart this is a didactic book, a  presentation of the basic understandings of Buddhism.  When those  philosophical and practical explanations occasionally become a little more  explicit or overt, it can create that &quot;pedantic&quot; effect.  All in  all, though, this is a very creative and literate presentation of the  Buddhist teachings, and certainly gives the reader plenty to contemplate.	1999-12-08
US	51247659	RT77V7VVJFX1M	0960068880	969793180	Handbook to Higher Consciousness	Books	5	194	196	N	N	The one book that really changed my life	I first picked this book up about 20 years ago just to see what kind of a silly book would have a title like that, but after reading just a couple of pages I realized that it actually contained some wisdom.  After reading a  few more pages I decided to buy it, and I can honestly say that it's been  the single most helpful book I've ever read in my life.  I've probably read  it a dozen times since then and it's the one book that's actually changed  my life.  For anyone willing to make the effort, these methods truly do  work, and you can start feeling the benefits almost immediately.  One thing  that may put off some readers is that it contains a few leftover 60's words  like &quot;groovy,&quot; but, if one can overlook that, the underlying  message in valuable beyond words.  Ken Keyes draws somewhat on Buddhist  ideas and other philosophies (as he notes in the introduction), but only a  genius could organize them into such a practical and usable system.  This  book has benefited me so much that I almost feel like it's my duty to write  this review to recommend it to others as well.	1999-12-03
US	51247659	R28YI8U0TSETYC	1567310079	86598545	Siddhartha	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A spiritual search beyond religious dogma	The review by the previous gentleman (a Muslim from Turkey) shows what is so precious about this book.  Although the setting is in ancient India, and Siddhartha studies and practices with Hindu brahmins and the Buddha, his  experience is not restricted to any specific religion.  It is something  that an open-minded person of any religion would be able to recognize as a  true spiritual search, which is really the essence of all the world's great  religions.  And any person sincerely drawn to their own spiritual search  will see something of Siddhartha in themselves, regardless of the  particular dogmas of their own religion or culture.  I think this is why  this book has stood the test of time and still inspires today.	1999-12-01

If I were to make  one criticism, it would be that it emphasizes the murals at the expense of  largely neglecting the sculptures, which are magnificent in their own  right.  The book might better be titled, &quot;Murals of the Ajanta  Caves.&quot;  I ordered it without seeing it first, and I was a little  disappointed to see how few photographs were included of the sculptures.   Nevertheless, the beautiful and clear photographs of the murals alone are  worth the price of the book, and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone  interested in the Ajanta caves, or in ancient Indian or Buddhist art.	1999-11-28

(It's quite short.) I enjoyed it just as much as the first time and understood it in a different  way than I had when I was younger.  For such a small and simple book it's  surprisingly rich, and really does make you kind of look at life in a new  way.  It's definitely worth the short time it takes to read it once --- or  even twice!	1999-11-25

Having been to Bodh Gaya and Sarnath myself, I find that these accounts by generations of pilgrims really bring the images and feelings back to me.  And the descriptions of the other places  (Lumbini, Kapilavastu, Rajagriha, Shravasti, Sankasya, Vaisali and  Kushinagara) are so vivid and alive that I now almost feel like I've been  to all of them too.  I'm sure that anyone with an interest in Buddhism,  India, pilgrimage or travel will appreciate this book.	1999-11-18

They are a great improvement over any previous translations of the Buddhist Pure Land  sutras, and the value of this work is enhanced by the scholarly  introduction and footnotes.  This is a great contribution to the field of  Buddhist studies, and will be especially appreciated by anyone with an  interest in the various Pure Land traditions and practices.	1999-11-18

While it's true that the Cultural Revolution brought  suffering throughout all of China, Tibet bore the brunt of the destruction  due to the devotion of the Tibetan people to their Buddhist religion and  traditions.  Of the more than 5,000 Buddhist monasteries in Tibet prior to  the Chinese invasion and occupation in 1950, fewer than 20 remain intact  today.  Most were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, and while the  Chinese government has recently allowed a few to be reconstructed for the  sake of tourist revenues, the heavy-handed suppression of the Buddhist  religion continues to this day --- punctuated by periodic  &quot;re-education&quot; campaigns in the few remaining monasteries.  The  Communist party line insists that the Tibetans needed Chinese  &quot;help&quot; to emerge into the modern world, but the only real  beneficiaries of whatever economic &quot;progress&quot; they've brought to  Tibet have been the millions of ethnic Han Chinese who've been induced to  migrate to Tibet during the occupation.  For anyone interested in the  plight of Tibet, &quot;Exile From the Land of the Snows&quot; is essential  reading.	1999-11-18

For a more updated and scholarly translation of the Pure Land  Sutras, I would recommend &quot;The Land of Bliss: The Paradise of the  Buddha of Measureless Light,&quot; translated by Luis Gomez, and of course  there are a number of fine modern translations of the Heart Sutra.  I think  this book (Buddhist Mahayana Texts) is worth buying, however, for the  English translation of the Buddha-karita, a beautiful and poetic life story  of the Buddha by the ancient Indian poet Ashvagosha.  This is one of the  classics of Indian literature.  Even though the English translation may  sound a little dated, the richness and beauty of the Sanskrit original  still shines through.	1999-11-18

John Reynolds has produced  a scholarly yet highly readable translation of this important text and  commentary, and has added a very helpful and insightful introduction and  commentary of his own.  For anyone seriously interested in practicing  Dzogchen, one of the most profound Tibetan Buddhist methods for realizing  the nature of the mind, this book will be a great treasure.	1999-11-18

Tantra is a very commonly misunderstood subject in the West, so an introduction like this by a genuine tantric master is particularly  valuable.  Anyone interested in penetrating the true meaning of Buddhist  tantric practice would do well to start with this highly readable and  authoritative guide.  Lama Yeshe's wisdom, experience and clarity shine  through on every page.	1999-11-16

Milarepa's life would be  an inspiration to spiritual aspirants of any religion, and especially to  anyone interested in the teachings and practices of Tibetan Buddhism.	1999-11-05

A great sinner early in his  life, he deeply realized impermanence and the constant immanence of death,  and the limitless spiritual potential of human life, and practiced so  intensely that he achieved complete Enlightenment.  This book is a  centuries-old collection of his &quot;vajra songs&quot; and spiritual  teachings as he wandered through the mountains and villages of 12-century  Tibet.  To this day, these beautiful songs of realization are among the  most popular topics of teachings by Tibetan lamas, particularly of the  Kagyu sect.	1999-11-02

The Majjhima Nikaya (Middle-length Discourses) is, along with the  other nikayas of the Pali Canon, probably as close as we can come today to  reading the actual words of the Buddha.  The Mahayana sutras have their own  great virtues, with their lofty vision and profound scope, but these  Middle-length Discourses are on a much more human scale.  What a joy and  inspiration it is to walk with the Buddha through the villages of ancient  India and hear his teachings to monks, royalty, peasants and members of the  other religious sects of the time.  Although his teachings weren't put into  writing for several centuries after his death, the monks of that period put  great emphasis on memorization and group recitals to ensure that nothing  was lost.  This lovely English translation is a great treasure for the  modern world, and particularly for all Buddhists.	1999-11-01

I'd highly recommend  Four Corners to anyone with an interest in this fascinating region.	1999-10-31
