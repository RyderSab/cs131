US	14979919	R3CF5NRSPW2KR0	0060557257	253092517	Sushi for Beginners	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Great Fun!1	I just finished this book. It is my first experience with the author and I have to say it got me hooked. I am looking forward to the rest of her books. This book is long so it will keep you busy, which is nice if you love to read. For those weary of the length the short 2-3 page chapters keeps the pages flowing. <br /> <br />There are many characters in this book, each with their own unique storyline, but all tied together by their ties to each other, through work and friendships. I am impressed with the authors ability to keep the stories seperate but not off subject.  <br /> <br />The main characters: <br /> <br />Gorgeous, workaholic Lisa has just relocated from London to Dublin to start a new magazine for women called Colleen. She is less than pleased with the move, as she is deeply fixated with pop culture, and finds Dublin to be dull. She is bitchy on the surface, but as you learn more about her you see that the tough exterior is only a front to help her cope with her insecurities.  <br /> <br />Working under Lisa is Ashling. She is the \\"girl next door\\" type, and oh so helpful. She is the one to turn to if you need a band-aid, button or tissue, as she carries everything around with her and is always willing to help. Her sweetheart personality annoys bitchy Lisa, but deep down Lisa's got a soft spot for her. She is very superstitious, as a result of her troubling childhood. She is trusting and non-confrontational. <br /> <br />Other characters include Joy, Ashlings neighbor who always drops by for a chat, and a go at the Tarot Cards. Ted, Ashling's friend who has just started a career in comedy as a way to meet women. Clodah who is married to oh so hot Dylan, and raising their two children. Jack, the mysteriously endearing boss of Lisa and Ashling. Marcus Valentine, Ashling's boyfriend\comedian. Trix the receptionist at the magazine. A homeless man named Boo, who Ashling befriends and many more. <br /> <br />The story deals with love, betryal, ambition, divorce, infedility and so much more. I urge you to follow the stories in this great novel. With so many great twists and turns along the way you'll never experience a dull moment. Key's writing is realistic and so down to earth. While you read and learn about the characters it becomes quite easy for you to see these characters as real people with real problems.	2005-02-23

All of the fabously rich things this nameless character, who refers to herself as Moi throughout, did kept me glued to the pages for some reason. I particularly enjoyed Moi's little acronmys!  <br /> <br />I believe that the authors intention was for the main character to be a bit obnoxious as many of the reviews seem to imply. I think Moi was supossed to piss us off, and secretly make us wish we had the very life we are hating on as we read. I believe it was the authors intention to poke fun at the lives of the fabously rich, and show the reader what young, shallow, rich bombshells do on a daily basis and what they may be thinking.  <br /> <br />While it really had no story to it, for some reason I still think it is worth reading. Take this one for what it's worth. Don't go into it thinking you're going to get a philoshophy lesson, just read it and laugh.  <br /> <br />	2005-01-27

Like many other reviewers have said all there are no new images of Britney many are from the I Love Rock and Roll video shoot, and the others are from music videos as well. She does look nice in the pics but they are also all very similiar. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about this calendar is that holidays are not labeled. I like calendars to tell me when it is a holiday such as President's Day so that I know if banks etc. will be closed. This calendar has no such labels so I have to look at my parents calendar for the info. It sounds like a trivial thing but I think it defeats the purpose of having a calendar.  <br /> <br />Overall I'd say even if you're a huge fan of Britney like I am don't get this calendar. There are tons of better ones out there this year.	2005-01-25

Well I am so glad I bought this! <br /> <br />The story is about Maggie who is a stay at home mom raising two young boys, whom she had with her live in boyfriend Jake. The two never married because Jake is just not into the whole marrige thing... this urks Maggie a bit... <br /> <br />Out one day with the children Maggie runs into Claire, and old friend from school, and upon dragging Jake to a party at Claire's house she begins to envy Claire's life as an unattached woman... Maggie seems torn between wishing Jake would just marry her already and wishing she was a carefree single. While at the party she also learns that the man living downstairs from Claire happens to be the attractive australian gardner who's van she happened to hit a few days or so before...  <br /> <br />Soon Maggie begins to suspect that Jake and Claire are having an affair... which leads Maggie to do some things she would most likely never do...  <br /> <br />I loved this book. I loved the irony involved and I feel the author penned the characters in a manner which makes them so loveable and sympathetic to them, especially Maggie... I suggest this book to anyone who loves the Chick Lit genre of books. You won't be let down.	2005-01-21

I felt like it just was moving way to slow, but once the relations between Sophie and Phinneas began the story made up for its slow start. So many crazy things happened to Sophie and her sister on their visit to tiny Temptation, Ohio where they are filming a video which may or may not be X rated. This book takes on so many twists and turns but what ultimetly got me hooked was the passion between Sophie and Phinneas. Deff. a guilty pleasure type novel.	2005-01-19
US	14979919	R35I037IFALNZ7	0767917219	865691715	The Right Address	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Guilty Pleasure	I see that this title recieved mixed reviews. I can see why but I actually enjoyed this book. I suggest that if you choose to read this do not take it seriously. If you want a serious book this isn't it. I believe the authors intention was to exaggerate things for shock value.  <br /> <br />The lives of many characters are examined in this book but the main character is a woman named Melanie. She is the second wife of a wealthy man, but doesn't come from money herself (she was a flight attendant). Melanie lives in the most coveted apartment building in Manhattan, and while all of the women who don't live there are jealous of her, they will never admit it, only beat around the bush. All of the other upperclass NY women hate Melanie, and look down at her, and she just longs to fit in. She wants to be accepted, and in her quest to be accepted she only seems to alienate herself more.  <br /> <br />Some of the smaller story lines included are, 1)Melanie's upstairs neighborand her husbands affair with his hispanic cleaning lady from the office. (She becomes demanding after becoming pregnant with his child, and he must cope with her wishes). 2)Jerome (a gay man who hangs out with 2 of Melanie's enemies) and his secret life. 3) Melanie's husbands attraction to a young author living up stairs and her secrets... to name a few. <br /> <br />This book had its funny parts and to me the story is just riviting. Very \\"guilty pleasure\\". Most of the story is \\"soap opera-esque\\" but I would suggest indulging if you aren't looking for a realistic book.  <br /> <br />Take this one for what it's worth.	2005-01-19

This is a cute light chick lit read. If you enjoy chick lit you'll enjoy this one.  <br /> <br />The story follows Jane who has just been laid off from a company that makes pink slips - how's that for ironic!? - as she attempts to pay her rent and find a new job, and maybe even work with some other victims of the companies layoff to get revenge. Jane also learns that her father - a hard working man - has also been let go from his job, and her mother - who has never worked a day in her life is now working for a trendy dot-com company and encourages Jane to apply. This light story pokes fun at the dreaded unemployment office, crazy roommates and family life.   <br /> <br />While another reviewer seemed upset at the few mistakes the author made in this text I have to say that to me those mistakes are so minute that I happened to miss them altogether and only now became aware of them upon reading said review.  <br /> <br />I suggest to take this book for what it is. A light work of fiction. It is not intended to be a pop culture bible, nor should it be expected to be. If you like chick lit you'll like  this book (Though I must say it is not the best I have read but still worth reading).I happen to think it was fun and will check out some of the authors other works.	2005-01-19

It was on the NY Times best seller list forever! I for one do not think this book deserved all of the recognition it recieved. <br /> <br />For one the novel is FILLED with annoying typos, misspellings, and grammar errors ( as I am sure many of my own reviews are, but this is allowed because I am not a published author ;) ). That really annoyed me to say the least. <br /> <br />Overall the story wasn't to bad. I mean it started out funny then got old quick. The characters were underdeveloped so it was difficut to get involved in the story being told. The secondary characters were mere snipbits and were practically useless.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line: The Devil Wears Prada is utterly dissappointing. While I didn't hate it enough to not finish I have to say having seen in on the bestseller list for so long I was hoping for more.	2005-01-19

Gotta say I just wasn't thrilled with the sad ending....<br /><br />However, I did love the characters and the overall concept of the story. It is always a shock when an old friend (possibly one you may envy) comes back into your life, and this story follows a few friends as they experience just that.<br /><br />I love this authors writing style, and I really felt the narrator Cath  was a close friend of mine throughout.

I choose this particular book because my boyfriend was toying with the idea of joining the Marines and I wanted to learn more about it, so I searched for a book that could tell me something about the subject. What I found was a fascinating account of bootcamp at Paris Island, South Carolina... I could not get enough of this book. <br /> <br />The author, having spent time with these young men as they experienced the Marine Corps basic training really captures the reality of the training experience. Told from many different points of view this book tells so much about the young men who choose a life of service.  <br /> <br />Upon reading this book I gained an even deeper respect for those who choose to make the Corps their life. I suggest this book to anyone wanting to learn about the Marine Corps, or anyone who knows someone in the Marines.	2005-01-19

I am so gald I read it. Since I read it so many years ago I will not attempt to summarize it. All you need to know is that if you read this you won't be sorry. As a white girl from a small New England town I found the urban narrator to be so interesting. This book shows what it is like in the ghetto, in the drug dealing world, and how ignorance can be your downfall. It shows that while doing things \\"the easy way\\" can be lucritive for a while, all of the things you do come back to haunt you, and the decisions you make affect not only you but those you love as well. I couldn't get enough of this book. Recommended for those over 16.	2005-01-19

It's like you read this entire book, and experience this great build up to NOTHING.... <br /> <br />Besides that dissappointment I found this book to be funny. I am a huge fan of the Chick Lit genre and this fit in perfectly with my tastes. <br /> <br />Lizzie is working in Hollywood as an assistant to an assistant, the bottom of the ladder. Though her status in Hollywood is low she is by no means stupid - having formally been working in politics in Washington DC, but nonetheless in order to be employed in the extreamly competive world of Hollywood she is an assistant assistant, tackling such challegeing tasks as sorting push pins by color, and walking dogs. <br /> <br />What Lizzie really wants is to become a screenwriter. Having been fetching lattes daily at the Starbucks across from the office she becomes aquainted with the cute man behind the counter, and they soon begin writing together in their spare time, promising that if one of them got someone to look at their screenplay they would not leave the other hanging... of course... <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil the fun in case you decide to pick this up. It's cute and a nice easy read. I just wish the ending didn't just flop.	2005-01-19

I thought this book was terrible. A great idea but terrible execution. Who wouldn't want to read a book about a murdered girl looking down at the life she left behind? Sounds so mysterious and intriging... but this was awful. It went on and on and on and it was just weird.  <br /> <br />I have nothing else to say beacuse this book was just too bad.	2005-01-19

This book take many twists and turns and involves murder, betryal and more!

While the subject matter is controversial and at times the author can be a bit vulguar the story is so intense and riviting I could not put it down. <br /> <br />How things change when we get a bit older. Friends from our younger years who we shared such fond memories become strangers to us as we grow up and enter high school. This is what happens to the characters in this book. Kids who experienced intense relationships as children become strangers, even enemies in their adolesence, as each attempts to discover who he\she is.  <br /> <br />This author has an incredible way of bringing his characters to life, and deeply develops each character. This book deals with high school popularity, homophobia, depression, rage and family secrets. I suggest this book to an older reader with an open mind, as some of the subject matter may not be appropriate for younger teens.	2005-01-19

She is a genius trying to cope with everyday life in a world of people who aren't quite as intelligent as she. She speaks with a psychologist regularly because he father pays for it and wants her to go. She hasn't had an average life to say the least, she skipped several grades early on in her life and was always told that once she got to college she would meet more people like her (which she didn't and comes to resent her father telling her it would be so).  <br /> <br />Filled with sarcasm this books clever little one liners and Carrie's over analyzation of EVERYTHING will have you laughing the whole way through. I suggest you follow Carrie Pilby as she tries to be normal in a world where normal is not eaisly defined.  <br /> <br />The littlest things that are analyzed in this book will really get you thinking. I loved this book I hope you will too.	2005-01-19

I am not a fan of children and have no interest in working with them or reading about them so I didn't think I would like this but I tried it and whatddya know, I LOVED IT!! <br /> <br />This is a book about a girl, Nanny, who is living in and going to school in New York City. She is a student at NYU who is specilizing in Child Development. She takes a job as a nanny for a very rich woman in New York City after meeting the child and his family at the park posing for a family photo (not realizing she was the current nannys replacement). Upon taking the job she basically becomes Mrs. X's slave. Her hours become unbearable, sometimes with no notice at all, leaving her neglecting her studies. Nanny, having bonded with the child, Grayer, takes all the crap Mrs. X dishes out... until she literally can not take it anymore!  <br /> <br />I LOVED this book. I have to say that while some of the situations were clearly exxaggerated for impact, it was overall realistic. There are many women who push off their child raising responsibilities to their young nannies, and take their services for granted. These two authors are wonderful and this book was full of humor and drama, an overall perfect satire. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read. You won't be dissappointed.	2005-01-19

If you thought planning your wedding was tough try planning 2 different weddings in two different countries, all while keeping one a secret from your family! That's Becky Bloomwood's challenge in the third book of the Shopaholic series. Fun an dfrustration fill the books pages from beginning to end.

All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.     Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.    Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series.	2005-01-17

I was reluctant to buy this one because of the abundance of terrible reviews it recieved, but I am glad I did. While it is not the best book I have ever read it was worth reading. These authors infuse their writing with great comedy which keeps readers from becoming bored.  <br /> <br />This book explores the sexually charged working world from a young girls point of view. An attempt at witty social satire the authors exxaggerate Girl's role in the work place and point to sexism and sex itself as a major obstacle for working women to overcome. The authors are attempting to have morals win out over dollars in the protaganists life which may be a rarity in society. <br /> <br />Overall I recommend this title for those who want something a bit heavier than the normal \\"Chick Lit\\". It has all the elements of the \\"Chick Lit\\" we all love with an extra little moral lesson, or attempt at one. Try not to take it so seriously and you will enjoy it.	2005-01-17

Everyones favorite shopaholic takes Manhattan's shopping scene by storm is the second installment of the shopaholic series. I don't want to give anything away so all I am going to say is, if you loved the first one you'll love this one. Kinsella will have you laughing out loud throughout.	2005-01-17

Alex is caught in the middle of being a loyal employee of the original agency and a new employee of the new agency fighting to keep her job. When Alex becomes aware of the shady plot to force an original founder of the original agency into retirement in order to make the new agency's owners more money Alex knows that something has to be done.  <br /> <br />This book explores the reality of ageism in Hollywood, in that the takeoever agency is filled with beautiful young women, while the original agency is made up of middle aged women. <br /> <br />Overall I'd say So 5 Minutes Ago is a fun quick read, but not as exciting as I expected. I was anxious to get my hands on this book only to be a bit let down.	2005-01-17

This book was used as a supplement for a Criminology course I took in the spring of 2004 and I have to say it is one of the best texts I have read for any of my classes. While it can be used as a text book it can also stand alone. I learned so much from this one book and would suggest reading it if you are interest in criminology.	2005-01-14
