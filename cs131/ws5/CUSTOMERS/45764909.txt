First off, yes, the transalation is NOT amazing, but its not hard to get past once you get trapped in the core story. :) So onto the review!!!<br /><br />These days, I read very few books, besides the Bible, spiritual growth books, and manga, but Koji Suzuki is an exception. He is probably the only author that I can get wrapped up in, no matter what book it is.! He says himself, that he doesn't consider himself a horror writer, or his books horror, he never attempts to write horror. And Spiral does show this.<br /><br />Spiral is such an odd step away from Spiral, it has the same kind of tone, but it doesn't feel as ominous and forboding. In short, it doesn't have the same feeling of impending doom. Spiral is more about unraveling a mystery, solving a code. At the same time, it still holds a very eerie quality, even though it steps into some very far-fetched plot turns, it somehow remains plausible because of the characters.<br /><br />Whereas the bad translation in Ringu didn't hurt the book a lot, the bad translation is pretty apparent here, but once again despite that, this book is still a VERY worthwhile read, and a good ride into the unknown.<br /><br />Anyways, if my review sounds vague, its only because I'd hate to ruin the book for you.! So enjoy!!!<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2005-04-26

Explosion, Vol. 1	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A cute look into what it takes to make it. :)	NOTE:  This review has been revised and re-written WEDS 1/23/13 for quality assurance purposes.<br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />  This will be a review of the whole series, so be warned, there may be some spoilers.<br /><br />  Re-reading my old review, I realize now just how naive I was to the realities of the music business and how this manga paints a totally unrealistic view of the industry.  This phrase from my original really paints my naivete:<br /><br />  \\"As someone whom has seen many fascets to the entertainment industry, it is nice to see a fresh and innocent, yet VERY honest portrayal of the entertainment industry.\\"<br /><br />  The truth is that this manga is for children, and as is the case with most mangas or novels dealing with the entertainment industry, they are purely fanatasy, showing no or little resemblance to the real thing.  Like me, however, you may begin to think, these books represent some kernel of truth, and they do, but you have to sift through a lot to find it.<br /><br />  The story of BB Explosion is about a girl name Airi who gets to audition for an elite \\"Actors School\\" in Okinawa which will not only give her the opportunity to meet her teen idol.  When she makes this decision a gollem, a guardian statue, comes to life on her way to the audition, one that only people who have \\"what it takes\\" to make it in the industry, can see, which gives her encouragement and advice.  It is a similar plot device to Sai in \\"Hikaru no Go\\" and it does work very well in this particular manga.  This character helps focus Airi as she realizes that as a member of the \\"Actor's School\\" she is expected to progress to eventually become a member of the show \\"BB Explosion\\" which she has watched so many times, and is in shock.  At first, she doesn't really give it a lot, and doesn't take it seriously, but when she is moved from the fast track class to the normal class, she realizes she wants to become a famous singer and starts truly pursuing it.<br /><br />  Throughout the manga, she goes through phases like this, where she works hard and achieves a level of success and then just levels out and stops working hard and growing.  I liked this aspect of the manga, and this is consistent in Asian culture, the belief that if you work hard, you will eventually achieve success.  I believe this to be true myself, especially now that I own a business.  In the music industry, however, this is less true because now that I have had a decent amount of experience in the industry and have met people who work in it or used to work in it, I realize that it is not something you can just work yourself hard in to it.  I suppose this series does show that, by the character of Caesar because not everyone can see him, therefor not everyone can make it, only a select few ever will.  This is completely true.<br /><br />  The record industry is a harsh world where you will be stepped on time and time again by the record labels and they do not want an individual, they want a yes-man, they want people who do what they are told, and who will conform to what they believe will make them money. This is especially true if you pursue a show like American Idol or X-Factor (I have been on American Idol).  These shows were created for entertainment, to tear thousands of people down only to exalt 1 person, as if they are magically a better singer because these people say so, which just is not true.  I have seen hundreds of fantastic singers get their hopes dashed, and the sad thing is, they let these strangers, these producers, these judges, to do it.  I allowed them to do it.<br /><br />  The book is based off of a real school, and the main character Airi is based off of a real person, but the real person never achieved the amazing success Airi does by the end of the book.  Where this manga falls short, though it teaches hard work (though there is one character in particular who is a little nasty, in the 3rd and 4th book, that may represent the true nature of the industry), it does not show the realities of the industry, it is merely a fluffy fantasy, and sadly, I would rather let my children watch a horror film than read this because while it is an encouraging read, it gives them a very distorted view of the record industry.  This doesn't mean I am saying you should not read this, no, you should read it for yourself and judge for yourself what you think of.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyk, that may represent the true nature of the industry), it does not show the realities of the industry, it is merely a fluffy fantasy, and sadly, I would rather let my children watch a horror film than read this because while it is an encouraging read, it gives them a very distorted view of the record industry.

US	45764909	R1X2V35ZICGYHB	1932234004	75828016	Ring	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A great Cerebral Horror Tale....	For those of you whom have only seen the American film, or maybe you haven't seen it, I suggest watching that, then the Japanese film(s), and then coming to this book. My reasoning for this is, that way you will NOT scrutinise the films for what they change or don't keep, ect, but take them as they are, because after you read this, you will be curious, and want to read them anyway. :)<br /><br />  I was a little leary of reading this book to tell youthe truth, I'm not sure, but I didn't think it would be something I'd like. I mean sure, I LOVED the movies, but I knew that this was different, of course the basica plot is the same: A person unravels a mystery surrounding a video tape that kills you. However, in this, it is a married man with a 1yr baby girl whom discovers the tape, Asakawa. The reason he gets involved is basically the same, but the tape is new in this, it has just been created. And rather then playing on innate nature to lean towards nuturing out curiosities, it plays more on how the tape is like a virus, and how its spreads. It also is very interesting in that it takes many turns that the movies would not dare to take, as the films tread more on the common and cliched, the books take on new territory. They take old ideas and make them anew.<br /><br />  Ring is the first book in what is sure to be an amazing trilogy(Only Ring and Spiral are out right now.). I would reccomend this book, and the second one \\"Spiral\\", to anyone whom is curious. You undoubtedly like this book if you like psycological/supernatural thrillers or just like a plain ol' good book.!<br /><br />  God Bless & Love ~Amy	2004-10-20

Most of the time, I like the style of Manhwa better than Manga, although I enjoy both, I just love the art style and humor of the Koreans a little more. :D Sometimes, the artstyle looks exactly the same as Japanese, but I like it when it is in the Korean style, in such Manhwa's as: \\"One\\", \\"Sweet and Sensetive\\", and \\"Snow Drop\\". I was curious about this one since I first saw it a few months back, but it kept slipping from my mind. Finally I purchased it at an Anime Convention, as well, I can't wait for Volume 2!!!<br /><br />  Saint Marie revolves around a High School Freshman \\"Dah-In Hyun\\", she is just a normal girl, her roomate is her best friend, they've been really close since Jr. High. But lately she's been acting a little distance, and Dah-in doesn't know why. Dah-in keeps hearing conversations of people that aren't talking. Soon though Dah-in finds out that there is a battle in her school, going on between two sides of people called to battle, the \\"Good\\" side, is the white side, and the \\"Bad\\" side is \\"Black. The black and white are chess pieces, and the school is their chessboard. This is what makes Saint Marie so intriguing, and I can only wait for the next volume to see more of this \\"battle\\".! Also, the characters are great, in the back pages it explains a lot about chess, and has profiles for each of the main/supporting characters.<br /><br />  So, if you're looking for something new to read that is a step above the other Manga/Manhwa, or are new to it, look no further than Saint Marie, it is only bound to get better. So, I hope you give it a try!!!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-09-26
US	45764909	R3HBEW5TFCY0EY	0618269193	575454780	The Presence: A Ghost Story	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A very pleasant surprise..... :)	Every now and then, while I am at the library, I will pick a random  book out to read, and sometimes they turn out to be great books, sometimes they suck. But luckily enough, when I picked \\"The Presence\\" by Eve Bunting, I picked right.<br /><br />  I am a sucker for ghost stories, so right off the bat, I had to pick this, but that didn't mean I expected it to be good, nope. Exactly the opposite, I thought it would be quite bad, quite ordinary. But it is not.<br /><br />  The Presence is one of those rare stories that tells the tale of not only how one girl copes with loss, but how many cope with loss. And it does it well, this is the second book I have read recently on this issues, the other being \\"Pop Princess\\", but out of the two, I would have to say that this one is better. For a few reasons: 1. the humans are'nt walking cliches. The people are quite real, everything seems quite real, while keeping a somwhat surreal atmosphere. 2. The author doesn't fall into the same traps as Rachel Cohn, despite uses the same basic story, except in a different setting. The character in this is coping in a different way, but she comes off as very likeable, unlike the lead in \\"Pop Princess\\".<br /><br />  Now, I know, you're probably going, \\"Geez, you must've hated that book!\\", actually, I loved it, but I think that it didn't succeed on the same level as The Presence. The Presence really captures Catherine's pain, by slowly revealing it to us throughout the novel instead of telling us right off the bat. It has an air of mystery too it, also because of the ghost she encounters, Noah, he is very mysterious, and his past is revealed slowly as well, keeping us wondering exactly why he is this way, until the end. :)<br /><br />  The book doesn't end in a snug package, but it does end nicely. It didn't feel contrived, or unnatural, I liked the way it ended, because it shows us a little more than some novels show, but also a little less at the same time. :)<br /><br />  Anyways, I know I haven't been overly descriptive, but I think it is best to leave you wondering, this book unravels its tale slowly, but it keeps you reading till the very end. And that is why I cannot reveal more without guilt, it just wouldn't be right. :D<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy/> <br />     Anyways, I know I haven't been overly descriptive, but I think it is best to leave you wondering, this book unravels its tale slowly, but it keeps you reading till the very end.

Now, the reason I had not already purchased it is because I didn't have it in my area, and I didn't feal like ordering from Amazon so, I waited patiently and Viz republished it!!!<br /><br /> Now, I AM VERY familiar with Rumiko Takahashi, but I have NEVER actually read her work, not to say I haven't wanted to, other things have just topped my list lately. But this was one of the things that topped my list, so as soon as I knew it was republished, I bought it. I know enough about Takahashi to know that she normally does humorous things, like &quot;Ramna 1/2&quot; and &quot;Inuyasha&quot;. But even though this is quite serious, it is a very intriguing, unique, and engross tale of immortality.<br /><br /> This story follows a man(Yuta) and a young woman(Manna). Both of them have eaten the flesh of a mermaid in there life. Which in this, if you have EXTREME luck, gives you the &quot;gift&quot; of immortality. All others whom don't have the &quot;luck&quot;, either 1. turn into a &quot;lost soul&quot;(A hideous monster), or die(personally I'd rather die!!!). There are 3 stories in this one: Part 1 and 2 of &quot;The Mermaid Never Smiles&quot;(Where we first meet Yuta and Manna, and the mermaids/immortality), part 1 & 2 of &quot;The Village of the Fighting Fish&quot;(A story that tales of Yuta's past), and the 1st part of &quot;The Mermaid Forest&quot;(A story following Yuta and Manna after TMNS). All the stories have to do with the same people, but the second story is more of a back story, I think that one is probably my favorite, but all of them are awesome, and make me excited and impatient for the next volume!!!<br /><br /> The art style is your classic Takahashi, but it is beautiful. I have come to appreciate and love her art style with &quot;Mermaid Forest&quot;. The translation, especially for Viz, is excellent. Not all of Viz's translations are bad, but they seem to hit or miss a lot. ;P<br /><br /> So, anyways, if you like Rumiko Takahashi, manga, or good stories in general(and don't mind some graphic violence), then you will undoubtedly enjoy this volume of &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot;.<br /><br /> God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyad, but they seem to hit or miss a lot. ;P  <br />  <br /> So, anyways, if you like Rumiko Takahashi, manga, or good stories in general(and don't mind some graphic violence), then you will undoubtedly enjoy this volume of &quot;Mermaid Saga&quot;. <br />  <br /> God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy <br />  <br />	2004-07-28

I am a conservative Christian so I wouldn't pick certain titles either, but this one caught my eye, and it is pretty intriguing. Although its nothing new, I was drawn into because it was funny, so I bought it.<br /><br /> Now this is the story of Megumi, a young 9yr boy whom is playing around a river bank with his friend one day and they save a \\"wizard\\" from an attack. He is then rewarded with a book that holds a genie whom grants him one wish. When Megumi ask to be made \\"the manliest man alive\\", he is turned instead into the womanliest woman alive!!! And the thing is, everyone except his friend whom was with him, remember him ALWAYS being a girl. As in being BORN a girl. But he STILL remembers being a boy, he has his memories as a boy. After living as a girl for 6yrs though, he is seeming less and less like a boy with his friends help. But he still fails miserably most the time, especially since he has to keep kicking the guys butts who chase after him because he is so HOT.! :D<br /><br /> Cheeky Angel is a lot of fun. It covers something VERY WELL that I have thought about a lot. \\"What would it be like to have a sex change?\\". I mean, that's just plain messing with God's will, but this guy had no choice and everyone remembers him being a girl except him and his friend, so its a little different. In reality he is a woman, but with the memories of a little boy trapped inside. I though \\"Well, I guess if he failed to find a Genie, he could get a sex change, since technically he is a boy....\\" HAHAHA its confusing, yeah. But its a HECK OF A LOT OF FUN!!!<br /><br /> All the things that the guys do is hilarious, and I love Soga, he has some of the BEST expressions.! :D So if you want something funny, and/or enjoy gender bending, you will be VERY delighted by \\"Cheeky Angel\\"!!!<br /><br />(...)	2004-07-27

A *Cute* & *Sweet* Manhwa	I read a lot of shoujo, it is probably my favorite genre of Asian comics. :D  This is a Manhwa(Korean Comics), and although there are some Manhwa's out there that look identical to manga(Japanese comics) like Ragnorak, this one has the trademark Manhwa style I've come to know and love from such other comics as [[ASIN:1591826888 Snow Drop, Vol. 5]] and [[ASIN:B000IOEM48 One (One)]]. The art is a little bit different, but in a fun and refreshing way.<br /><br />  Well, first off, I picked this up on a whim, I said \\"OOOOOOOOH!!! The cover IS SO PRETTY!!! I'LL GET THAT!!!\\", really, that's what I said. :D  I bought it, not expecting much, but it turned out to be a very light and enjoyable read about a high school girl named \\"Eeji\\" whom lives in a house with her parents and 3 brothers, they like to boss her around a lot.  One of her brother likes to run out of the shower yelling \\"I NEED A TOWEL!!!\\" butt naked(which is actually quite humorous. ;P). When Eeji starts going to High School she meets a guy whom looks really familiar, and starts pursuing him, but along the way she runs into another guy whom takes a fancy with her and starts pursuing her. So forms the \\"triangle\\" which undoubtedly will fill the rest of the volumes.<br /><br />  Despite its conventionalizes, its a fun, semi-romantic, and a quick and entertaining read. I can't wait for the next volume either. Its only bound to get better.! So pick it up today if you love Shoujo!!!<br /><br /> God Bless ~Amy	2004-07-26

I just thought it was cute. However, with volume 2, it develops the characters of Akira and Suoh more, taking the spotlight away from Nokoru, and as much as I love Nokoru, it was nice to see the other characters fleshed out a bit more. :D Even though the boys do look almost exactly the same, they're personalities really set them apart. Nokoru is the woman obsessed-slacker-genius, Suoh is the martial arts pro, goal focused, and serious one, and Akira is the young innocent master chef whom looks up to his Senpai's with adoration.<br /><br />  The stories in this one are much better too. Especially the story that involves Suoh's search for a girl he saw in the Wisteria.<br /><br />  If you even remotely like volume 1, you will love volume 2! It is just as much fun, the characters are stronger, and the art work is gorgeous. Its more than a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />  God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy	2004-07-08

But in this after the first story, it actually gets serious as it goes into a back story about how Suog and Nokoura met. This is probably the best story in the whole series. While it is still pretty light and fun, it has serious and dark overtones to it as well. It was nice to see a bit of a change of pace, and a little more depth to the characters as well.<br /><br />  It makes me wish that this series was longer. I found that with each volume I enjoyed it more and more, and cared about the characters more and more. That is a very impressive feat. I never cared much for Clamp either, but I have come to enjoy several of their other works including: [[ASIN:142154041X X, Vol. 1: 3-in-1]].<br /><br />  So, get this volume, it is 100% worth if you even REMOTELY enjoyed the last two volumes. :D<br /><br />  God Bles & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-07-08

This is a manga for those looking for a break from those with heavy subject matter or ones with complicated emotions. This is a manga for those young at heart, for anyone with a fun-loving spirit and a non-cynical attitude.<br /><br />  I read this manga intially because my brother purchased it and had me read it. It took me a while to read because I lost it. At first I didn't think it was anything special, but once I'd finished it the first volume, I fell in love with the fun stories.  The plots are far-fetched and the idea of finding three 9-11yrs who are this smart and rational, is highly unlikely but that is why this manga is fun! The characters are cardboard cut-outs (in the best sense, however), and no real character development what-soever, if you are looking for that, look elsewhere.<br /><br />  The manga follows Nokoru Imonoyama, Suoh Takamura, and Akira Ijuyuin, the three members of the Clamp Elementary School Board. They begin solving crimes and mysteries to help Damsels in Distress. And this manga follows their \\"mini\\" cases. I hope that in the 2nd volume(which I will be reading shortly), they will be developed a little more character-wise. :D That the mysteries they solve will be harder as well! :)<br /><br />  It's a light, fun, and fluffy read, and if you are looking for something to help you escape reality, because this manga has zero bearing on reality, then it is most likely something you will enjoy!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-06-29

She buys a wig with dark brown mid-legnth hair to hide her beautiful long red hair, and some large fake coke-bottle glasses to disguise her beautiful face, and some drab clothes that hide her figure (as far-fetched as this is, I actually no someone who did something similar to this, and it did work). It works and nobody recognizes her, she calls herself \\"Ella Sanders\\", and starts attending the local high school. She meets a nice normal guy named Dave and they hit it off.<br /><br />  Just a few years ago there was a TV movie with Justin Timberlake and Maggie Lawson based off of this book. It was also titled \\"Model Behavior\\", but its not as good as the novel, and the TV film was more of a new version of \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" than an adaptation of this book, and not a very good one at that.  The book deals with some of the same issues such as finding yourself, but it is about far more than that.<br /><br />  I guess Jaqueline isn't the most interesting female lead, but the male characters are fun, and the romance is nicely written, its a fun, fluffy, and funny book. The book is trying to say that models are just like you and me, no matter how aloof and far off they may seem. While we all know that, it is something we often forget, especially as teens, we seem to see models as something we should strive to look like, if they were treated as normal people, then we probably would stop looking at them, which the book does show. Regardless of its intended message, it is  a fun and nostalgic quick read for teenagers. Highly enjoyable.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-06-21

Cut is about something that is hard to tell a story about without seeming melodramatic, soap-operish, or cliche. Patricia McCormick succeeds, even though the story is many of those things. She did a few years of research on the subjects of this book before actually writing it which at least actually makes the location of a girls rehabilitation center feel more real, though the characters still feel a bit carbon-copied.<br /><br />  Callie is a 15yr girl whom is stuck at \\"Sea Pines\\" or \\"Sick Minds\\" as the patients like to call it. It is a place where people with \\"issues\\" go; Food issues, drug issues, or self-mutilation issues. Callie, as you can guess cuts. Which means in order to release her emotional pain she gives herself a cut on her physical body. This is why she is at Sick Minds. When we come into her story she is not talking to anyone at Sick Minds or anyone period, she doesn't want to, and she doesn't want anyone to why she's there.  There are other girls who are probably more screwed up then her, which include and anorexic girl that has had a heart attack because she wont eat, and she still doesn't eat, and a girl whom keeps eating to ease her pain. There is another anorxic girl, and two drug abuse girls in her group as well. Through the story we begin to find out why Callie is hurting herself and why she wont talk.<br /><br />  Now, for the audio book, I absolutely LOVED Clea Lewis' voice. She does the voice for Pepperanne's blonde friend(can't remember her name), in the cartoon show Pepperanne. At first I was unsure of whether or not it would be any good with her voice, but she makes very good use of it. Pretty much all the characters voices are very distinguishable from one another, and just like the books I didn't want to stop listening to it.<br /><br />  Speaking from person experience, I have had issues similar to these, I have eating \\"issues\\" and other things, I understand what these girls, especially Calie is going through. Hearing it a second time on tape after I began counseling and such I've begun to really see the parallels between the characters and myself. I think that people with issues like myself are very well portrayed, it shows that there is hope if you seek help. Your life doesn't have to be dark and depressing all of the time. :)<br /><br />  1/25/13 Sadly, my counselor didn't actually help me get to the root of my problems, which was PTSD, I had to discover that for myself in 2009 after getting married.  In 2006, I developed a cutting problem shortly after I overcame my eating disorder, I all ready had self-abuse problems with biting and kicking myself in the past, but never any flesh wounds and I was able to stop doing that a few years before I started cutting.  What truly helped me heal was my faith in Jesus Christ, but also the friends I had who I lived with and helped me get to the roots of my problems, and being there for me.  They helped more than a counselor or psychiatrist ever could, sadly, all they did was dope me up and harangue me.<br /><br />  These issues I struggled with, and Callie too and the other characters in this book, could never be conveyed in a book as short as this.  While it is a good introduction to these issues for children, it also gave me ideas for ways to cut myself when I started cutting, and sadly, this is the issue with these kinds of stories, while they are intended to help, they may actually do more harm then good, even though in the end, Callie conquered her demons.<br /><br />  One of the other issues in the book is the way it compartmentalizes the issues in to one person per issue, as all ready said, I struggled with anorexia and cutting, as well as bulimia and codependency, most of which cause by the abuse I suffered as a child.  Most people have more than one of these issues at a time, not just one.  The book does not address the issue of transference either, which I all ready said was an issue of mine, that is, the transference of one form of self-abuse to another, or even a transference to others abuse.<br /><br />  With these things in mind, I would not recommend it to people struggling with issues however, but rather I would give it to people who want to understand more about these issues, maybe people who have friends who struggle with these issues.  It is a cursory study of the topic of teen self-abuse, and will at least give a decent amount of insight.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyo another, or even a transference to others abuse.<br /><br />  With these things in mind, I would not recommend it to people struggling with issues however, but rather I would give it to people who want to understand more about these issues, maybe people who have friends who struggle with these issues.

With the way they talk about it, it seems they are talking about something entirely different.<br /><br />  REVIEW: Lapis is was born into the Spar community from a Hunchback woman and a Dwarf(who reminds me of a miniature Santa clause ;p) man, he has been born doubly cursed.  This curse involves him turning from a man into a woman at any given time, and usually at the worst times. He just hopes that him and his parents can escape to paradise after collecting the 12 stones that his father gives to him for his birthday. After a misunderstanding his parents are murdered by the cruel ruling habit(ruling people) Diamond whom loves Lazuli, Lapis' female form.<br /><br />  I do love fantasy, and this is the tale of a young man coming to terms with his destiny.  Les Bijoux is a fun fantasy tale, but its not light-hearted. Its a pretty heavy story, though lightened with humor throughout the series. The whole thing with Lapis changing into a woman makes me wonder, \\"What would I do if I was both man and woman\\". I mean, how could you choose which to date? Or marry!? Of course that's not what Lapis is worried about in the 1st Volume, he just wants to avenge his parents death, and Diamond whom is in love with his female side Lazuli, does not realize that Lazuli and Lapis are the same person. With these heavy issues, and it's fun spirit and sense of humor Les Bijoux remains a fun and thought-provoking read.<br /><br />  Give Les Bijoux a try, you've got nothing to lose. You'll love it if you like Fantasy and/or bishounens, and charters who are real people and just not really hot guys.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-06-17

Peach Girl is an odd concept really, I mean we're following the love escapades of a girl whom is naturally blonde and tan in a world where everyone has dark hair and non-tan skin. Momo can't help it, she hates the way she looks, she wishes she could look like everyone else around her, if you are American and reading this review, it may seem a little off because here in the U.S. someone like Momo would be considered an absolute babe, but obviously in Asia, they have different standards of beauty.<br /><br />  So in this volume Momo has to deal with a backstabbing friend whom copies everything she does and tries to steals all the guys from Momo's life. Any guy that seems to take interest in Momo or/and that Momo likes. All Momo wants to do is look normal and get some friends who are not total jerk wads and because Momo is so insecure about the way she looks she doesn't realize all the guys that like her. its kind of fun to get some insight into the life of the \\"hot\\" girl. All girls are insecure about the way they look, especially the ones we consider hot because as it shows in Peach Girl, they often are subject to a lot of vitriol for \\"looking good\\".<br /><br />  Of course \\"Peach Girl\\" isn't deep, its a whole LOT OF FLUFFY SHOUJO!!! If you like fluffy shoujo then you'll love Peach Girl no doubt.!<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-06-03

I will admit I am pretty big fan of vampire stuff, and I used to condemn anything with vampires, but being the horror fan I am, I was gradually drawn into them. So when my brother purchased &quot;Lament of the Lamb&quot; and told me it was a &quot;different&quot; take on vampires, I had to check it out. Of course I'm no vampire expert, but I have seen enough to know that I've never seen it done like this before. haha<br />  Most the time vampires are often glorified, but anyway you look at its more of a curse then a blessing. In this manga however, there is no immortality, no people biting you and turning you into a vampire, no in this, vampirism is a genetic disease/curse that will eventually kill you, possibly drive you mad if you resist it.<br />  Kazuna is your typical high school student, he's not sure what to do with his life after he graduates, he has no plans. One day he finds himself reacting strangely to blood, he passes out at the sight of it while sitting in as a model for a friend whom is painting him. He has no idea what is going on and can't figure out why he'd react to it like that. He soon finds himself having strange and terrifying dreams, he is drawn to his old house, and there he discovers many hidden secrets.<br />  I really enjoyed the art style and story in this. It was very well-drawn and very well-written. I look forward to the next volume, I think it will only get better because things can only get more complicated as it goes on. :D<br />  So, I hope this intrigued to and encourages you to check out &quot;Lament of the Lamb&quot;, especially if you're tired of the same ol' vampire tales that litter media.<br />  God Bless &amp; *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-06-03

Well, unique in story, not really: So it goes Jenny You is a famous Pop Princes \\"Doll\\", but she is your regular diva with a princess complex. She hates what she's doing, but her mother makes her. The other lead character is Eumpa One, he is new to Daewon High School, and unlike all other guys, is unimpressed by Jenny's beauty. Instead he longs after a rather plain looking girl named \\"Younjou\\".  Before long though Eumpa begins noticing Jenny, but not for the typical reasons. Eumpa is a musical genius, he is actually a genius all around, he is 1/2 Korean, but lived in the U.S. and learned Korean in a month in order to be able to study there(Yikes!).<br /><br />  One is not a manga, it is Manwha.  In case some people don't know, Manhwa is like Manga, but it is Korean comics. I have grown fond of Manhwa, I love their art style, my favorite is [[ASIN:B008GKBO60 Snow Drop, by Choi Kyung-Ah , Volumes 1-12, Complete]], which I highly recommend, and there are other Manhwa's that out there like [[ASIN:1591826098 Faeries' Landing, Vol.1]], [[ASIN:159182690X Les Bijoux (Les Bijoux), Vol. 1]], and [[ASIN:1931514739 RAGNAROK #1]]. Point is, manga isn't the only thing now, and Manhwa is printed from a left-to-right format, so its not what we call \\"backwards\\".<br /><br />  Even though the story isn't all too unique, the characters are great and the art work is beautiful and fun, especially their facial expressions; much the same way the expressions in Snow Drop are amazingly entertaining. The characters in this manwha actually look their unlike, unlike most other manwhas or mangas where the characters often look 10-20yrs older than they actually are.  The characters, as the series going become a lot more complex, even if you are not entirely impressed with the first volume, I would give it a second chance and read the next couple of volumes, it will grab you!<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-05-27

Most of the time, I read a lot of shoujo, I'm a serious shoujo maniac. I read licensed and unlicensed manga, so I've read a good variety (and not just shoujo). What drove me to buy 'Demon Ororon&#34; was I was looking for something a bit different than what I normally read. Reading the same thing over and over, gets old sometimes.<br /><br />While 'The Demon Ororon' isn't necassarily entirely original, it is certainly interesting, and the art style is refreshing. At first I was a little off-set by the artwork because the chins are so long, but I have come to appreciate it, it fits the dark story-line.<br /><br />As for thr story it is about when a girl(Chiaki) takes in a man from the side of the road because he is badly injured and she wants to help him. He turns out to be not a man, but the King of Demons. This sounds absurd to her, but he says he will grant her one wish, she wishes that he would stay by her side forever, and so we have the stage set for the story to follow, which become increasingly entangled and intriguing as the volume number increases. There is a fair amount of violence and not really romance, but a deep emotional relationship between Chiaki and Ororon.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, just like that other review, it is the poor editing.! Couldn't they have done a better job here? I mean this is a major company, I have come to expect better from Tokyopop.!<br /><br />Anyways, if you're looking for a dark story that has some horror elements give Ororon a try, it is worth getting used to the unique art style for.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2004-05-27

Paradise Kiss starts off, in the first volume, with a somewhat fantastical style, and then with each volume we get to know the characters a little bit more as they grow into adulthood and get ready to face the real world and things are slowly more and more grounded in reality. Which is unfortunately what ends up happening to most people as they grow up, they let go of their dreams for \\"reality\\".<br /><br />  In Volume 4 the Fashion Show is about to happen and now Yukari and George's relationship is not such a sure thing. What seemed like a match made in heaven is now seeming to become something that can never truly work out.  George hates to be tied down and is far to flighty to maintain a long-term relationship, especially once reality hits.<br /><br />  Yukari is getting ready for her college exams and finding work as a model, George is still uncompromising, and the whole Paradise Crew remains optimistic, even when its seems failure is eminent.  The thing about this volume is how realistically it deals with the relationship of George and Yukari and the triangle of Miwako, Arashi, and Tokumori. This volume and the last volume make it pretty clear that its no longer a fantasy, but some of the Paradise crew are starting to face \\"reality\\", for better or worse.<br /><br />  Oh, and another thing, guess what! We learn more about Isabella, woohoo!!!!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-05-20

I've read quite a bit, not just the stuff released here, but I've read many scanslated mangas(Mangas scanned and translated by fans, its legal while the manga isn't licensed here. :D) as well, and a lot of smut even. I've read manga that tries pretty hard to be all sexy and what-not, and most the time it's just sex, and not even remotely sexy, it just isn't successful in that area.<br /><br />  I am a conservative Christian and single waiting for marriage (NOTE: THURS 1/31/13 I did make it to marriage with having sex.  :D), I generally I don't read things with sex in it, I wont read it, or I'll skip over those parts. This volume didn't have any actual sex, it did have a little nudity, but it wasn't overdone, and it was tasteful, so  its no loss if you cover it. ;P<br /><br />  Anyways, part of the reason this manga works so well is because of Sakuya, the lead male, he is just so freakin' hot! My brother even thought so, and he is totally straight. lol Its really something when you can get a straight  guy to admit something like that. I've read it twice, and I think I liked it EVEN MORE the second time. Aine at first, seems like a weak character, but she is the perfect balance for Sakuya. Her innocence and his experience is what makes this manga so sexy.<br /><br />  This is DEFINITELY every girls fantasy, you know, meet a famous rock star and have him not only fall in love with you, but make you his lyricist! HECK YEAH!!!!<br /><br />  If you're looking for a break from the typical and tame girly shoujo manga, I HIGHLY recommend Sensual(Kaiken) Phrase to you. Recommended for older teens and young adults.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-05-17

Maybe you're just browsing through to see how good these books are because you're wondering the series is still worth reading. Well, fear not! These books are EVEN BETTER!!!<br /><br />  Since I am reviewing the box-sets, I would say this particular set is my favorite because these books begin to change the series, they lead it into an entirely new direction as a whole. By the time you read these and get to the latest \\"The Slippery Slope\\", it almost feels like an entirely new series, but in a good way. The characters are more defined, the situations are more absurd, and the plots are tighter. :D<br /><br />  Book Seven: The Vile Village - This is a book that deals with a town obsessed with birds(crows), and has thousands of rules that center around protecting them or protecting the rules. Its basically a totalitarian society. So this books focus is a primitive government that is out of hand. They have a system where you don't get a fair trial hearing, you don't get to tell your story, this is because all they care about is burning people at the stake.<br /><br />  The reason that the children are here is because the village VFD goes by the aphorism \\"It takes a village to raise a child.\\", and so the children get to choose a village to be raised in since no one else will take them. They choose V.F.D. for obvious reasons(if you've read the previous books).<br /><br />  Like all the books, it can be painful and infuriating to read, especially since the towns people are more than a little unreasonable in the face of logic.  The plot also deals a lot with the idea of the mob mentality and how people, a lot of times, rather than doing the right thing, do what everyone else says is the right thing to do.<br /><br />  Book Eight: The Hostile Hospital - I couldn't wait to get to this book because of the morbid cover.  This book has the children on the run yet again(no I'm not going to spoil why.), and they come across a hospital and find a way to become volunteers at the hospital in the Archival library in hopes of finding out information on V.F.D. and Jaques Snicket. Their's not much I can say without ruining it. This book is fun because it reveals a few secrets and takes some new twist in the characters and story, it's not creepy like the cover suggest it could have been, but it a lot of fun. :D<br /><br />  Book Nine: The Carnivarous Carnival -  This book is interesting because of how the Baudelaire's get here, what they do in it. Things they thought they wouldn't do in a million years, and over and over they find themselves doing them. I wont give anything away, its impossible to summarize the plot without giving anything away since if you're reading this you probably haven't read the other two preceding it, so I wont. But it captures the carnival atmosphere perfectly and its great.! :D<br /><br />  This is a great set to buy, of course if you can't afford it you can buy the three books separately or go to library, but be aware that you WILL want each immediately after the other. If you can, get all three at the same time! + The Slippery Slope, which is in my opinion the best book yet, this series just keeps getting better.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyital in the Archival library in hopes of finding out information on V.F.D. and Jaques Snicket.

In this installment to Paradise Kiss the character of Yukari continues to grow and become her own person, and for the first time since I started reading this series, I've found myself disliking George. All the characters seem to be growing(except maybe Isabella, but even she(he) had some development in the second Volume).<br /><br />  Yukari has decided to become a professional model and goes all the way with George which leads to her moving in with him. She must have her mother sign some papers in order for her to join the modeling agency however, so this leads to a dilemma. Can she go home and will her mother accept her choices?<br /><br />  Though the fashion is still very prominent, the story and characters are taking the forefront even more int this volume. This is a good thing, because the characters are so good the story seems new and fresh with page, they seem real and not like just the normal cut and paste manga characters in Shojo.<br /><br />  What makes this series so fun is how it mocks traditional shoujo manga plots and characters, the characters are aware that their in a comic, and are constantly breaking the 4th wall. Yazawa somehow makes this work extremely well, it makes it more funny. :D<br /><br />  Be aware there is a large portion of sexual content in it, for a conservative like myself, it is good to know before delving in to this manga. The love scenes are done tastefully, and hey you can always cover it like me if you don't want to see them. ;P I would suggest not giving this to those under 16yrs of age.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-05-04
US	45764909	R2M1GYW4411NHR	0060095563	849471024	The Situation Worsens: A Box of Unfortunate Events, Books 4-6 (The Miserable Mill; The Austere Academy; The Ersatz Elevator)	Books	5	31	39	N	N	Books 4-6: Hitting the stride....	It is easier to review the box set then three separate books in three separate reviews, so this is what I am doing.<br /><br />  I had a 1yr hiatus between books 3 & 4.  I became disinterested in the series, but for some odd reason I decided to pick the series up again. I never stopped thinking about the books or liking them, I just felt they weren't good enough to continue reading.  Maybe you've felt the same about the first 3 books as well. If you have, I encourage you to continue to read on.<br /><br />  In book 4, though its the lowest rated on Amazon.com at 4stars, I wouldn't say its the worst, this is the book that got me hooked, the book where I really appreciated Snicket's humor and morbid writing style. Maybe it had to do with me being older, or the old saying \\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\\", who knows? With this in mind, on to the reviews!<br /><br />  Book Four: The Miserable Mill - I have a feeling that the reason this book is rated so low because of the Child Labor issue. I mean the person whom is in charge of the Mill is disgusted at the idea that some 14, 12, and 1yr children should do normal children things.  No, he believes that they are loafers and must make a living for him in the Mill living on nothing but a stick of gum for lunch and a small dinner.<br /><br />  We're talking about machines that could very easily kill children, especially babies. Not to say everyone at the mill  supports this notion that they should work there, but none  of the adults are willing to oppose the foreman, and that's how it is.<br /><br />  This book handles the issue of child labor very well.  I enjoyed the book because of the touchy issue because it handles it with dry humor but yet it still takes the issue seriously. Be aware what you're stepping into, and in my opinion this book has Count Olaf's best disguise.<br /><br />  Book Five: The Austere Academy - This book deals with bullies. In the form of Carmelita Spats and Mr. Nero. They both despise orphans, and this is why any orphans in the school are forced to live in the orphans shack. Right now, that is where the Baudelare's are residing. The former residents were the Quagmire triplets. A brother and sister whom lost their brother and parents.<br /><br />  Since Sunny is too young to attend school she is forced to be an administrative assistant and the Baudelare's have to learn in classes with moronic teachers who make them memorize dumb stories and exact measurements of things. Nero also makes all students listen to his horrible violin playing in a nightly mandatory 6hr concert, whoever doesn't must give him a big sack of candy. ;P Its quite absurd, is it not? Yet this is the joy of these books, the serious paired with the absurd. Book 5 is the place where the books begin to take a new turn in events. But of course I wont give that away, but they only get better here!<br /><br />  Book Six: The Eratz Elevator - This book has them placed in the care of Jerome and Esme Squalor, a couple whom lives on the top of a HUGE apartment complex in a room with 70some odd rooms(Boy I wish I lived there, hehe). This book deals with the the obsession of being fashionable or as Esme would say \\"In\\". haha She is OBSESSED with being the most fashionable AKA in style person possible, which includes such things as going without electricity, wearing pin-stripe suites(Actually I like pin-stripes, ;P). As well as many other ridiculous things like eating at a cafe that serves only salmon dishes(including dessert).  There many more things to be revealed here, but I don't want to give anything else away. Its just a lot of fun  watching Snicket make fun of people obsessed with fashion and doing things because they are \\"in\\". :D<br /><br />  All in all, I'd say this is a strong set. The books only get stronger after these three, so if you love these 3, you'll love the next three even more. :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyand this is why any orphans in the school are forced to live in the orphans shack.

Well, I'll admit its been a while since I've read the first three books of the series.  They are are my least favorite in the series, simply because they get much better after those three.  Especially after book 5, however since this is a 1-3 box set, you will have to go read my reviews for the other box-sets if you want to compare the quality of these ones to the ones that proceed them.<br /><br />  Book One: The Bad Beginning - Well in book one we our introduced to the Baudelaire's, they are quite happy children that live with their parents in a large house, and are very rich.  These children include: Violet, a 14 year old whom is a genius inventor, and will tie her hair up when in the midst of inventing, Klaus, her 12 year old brother whom is a genius of books; he can't get enough of them, and is quite often a well of information, and last but not least Sunny, a small baby whom is still crawling, can't really talk yet except with made up words, but she has four extremely long & sharp teeth.<br /><br />  Now, so the story goes, the Baudelare children were playing on the beach, when they became orphans, this is where their misfortunes begin, because they must live with a guardian now, a relative or something. Well, they end up living with Count Olaf, and really I don't want to tell you more of that book, or it will ruin the story for you.<br /><br />  NOTICE: If you don't want ANYTHING in the books after book 1 spoiled DON'T read the next to descriptions of the books, skip them and read my summary.<br /><br />  Book Two: The Reptile Room - In this book the Baudelaire's have escaped Count Olaf and Mr. Poe has placed them in the care of Dr. Montgomery Montgomery, or their Uncle Monty. He is a man whom studies reptiles and has many interesting and dangerous reptiles. The Baudelaire's begin to feel that they will actually enjoy living there too, but is it safe for them to get comfortable?<br /><br />  Uncle Monty is a lot of fun, and it's great seeing all the reptiles, in fact, this is the book that inspired me to become a herpetologist myself, with a collection of 14 reptiles currently, and counting.  This is the most joyful book, it is sad, in places, but the orphans really have a lot of joy with Monty, which makes the subsequent books even more bittersweet.<br /><br />  Book Three: The Wide Window - After they had to leave Uncle Monty's house(I wont say why), Mr. Poe has placed them in their care of their paranoid grammar obsessed Aunt Josephine. A woman who's husband died a couple years back and wont use stoves in fear that she set the house on fire or something like that. Her house \\"barely\\" sits on a ledge next to lake Lachreymose by Domocles Dock. The Baudelaire's don't enjoy living there very much, but how long will it last anyways?<br /><br />  Well, I would say that \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is for those who are morbid at heart. These books have an extremely morbid sense of humor, and a hell of a lot of social commentary for such short books are supposedly for children.  They all have a great sense of humor, which may take some time to get used to, and even though book 4 is the lowest rated on Amazon.com, I'd say that is where the books really hit their stride. That's where I really began to enjoy the books and their unique sense of humor.<br /><br />  Whether you are young or old, though I think older people may enjoy these a little more cause they can understand them better (and most the people I know who've read them have been at least my age, 19yrs), you'll probably still enjoy them, they're fun books, and they have some things to teach, even though they don't seem like it.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyin fact, this is the book that inspired me to become a herpetologist myself, with a collection of 14 reptiles currently, and counting.

The Baudelaire's don't enjoy living there very much, but how long will it last anyways?<br /><br />  Well, I would say that \\"The Series of Unfortunate Events\\" is for those who are morbid at heart. These books have an extremely morbid sense of humor, and a hell of a lot of social commentary for such short books are supposedly for children.  They all have a great sense of humor, which may take some time to get used to, and even though book 4 is the lowest rated on Amazon.com, I'd say that is where the books really hit their stride. That's where I really began to enjoy the books and their unique sense of humor.<br /><br />  Whether you are young or old, though I think older people may enjoy these a little more cause they can understand them better (and most the people I know who've read them have been at least my age, 19yrs), you'll probably still enjoy them, they're fun books, and they have some things to teach, even though they don't seem like it.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-05-03
US	45764909	R1OFRJU4QUJLGK	0689852053	356177526	Pop Princess	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Horrible Cover, Dumb Name, but a Great Book!!!	I got this book on a whim, 1/2 because I wanted to see how much it would suck(based on the cover and title, I figured it would be a retarded cliche of fame and failure.), and 1/2 because I don't have many books to read and am always searching for decent ones. So imagine my surprize when I read \\"Pop Princes\\" in less then a day. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />  First off, I want to say that I never read all of Rachel Cohn's first novel \\"Gingerbread\\" because of my moral belief's (I don't mind reading things that morally contradict my belief's as long as they do not shove them down my throat), but I may try picking it up again(for the third time). But from what I read of it, I know that Cohn has a unique talent, the talent to bring up issues in teen novels(whether I like them or not), that most teen novel authors avoid like lepers, or when they do address them they're so horribly cliched that you want to use to book as a rock to throw at the author(There are exceptions like Sarah Dessen, Laurie Halse Anderson, and Meg Cabot, though even Meg Cabot gets too far on the preach side at times with the whole \\"Self-actualization spiel every few pages). While there is definitely some preaching (there is a lot more in some of her late books than here) its not over bearing, it actually gives a semi-descent view in to the life of a would-be pop star.<br /><br />  \\"Pop Princess\\" tells the story of Wonder Anna Blake, a 16yr outcast girl whom has been grieving from her sisters death for the past 2yrs. She works at the local Dairy Queen, and has gained a lot of weight since her sister \\"Lucky\\" died. Her and he sister used to be on a show called \\"Bean Town Kidz\\"(VERY similar to the New Mickey Mouse Club). One day when she is mopping the floors on a late night, a customer comes in, it \\"happens\\"  to be a guy her and her family knew when her sister was alive, a manager that was going to sign Lucky's music group made up of her and her two friends. He hears Wonder singing to \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" and wants her to record a Demo. She doesn't want to because singing was Lucky's dream, not hers. But soon she decides to do it in her sisters memory  and because she thinks it may be her ticket out of Devenport (her home town), the dinky ocean town she hates so much.<br /><br />  One of the nice things about Pop Princess is the way it conveyed the Pop music industry. It conveyed it PERFECTLY (October 20, 2010 and now that I have had a bit of experience within the pop music industry, I can say that it is pretty spot on in general)!!! I also wanted to yell at Wonder \\"HELLO!!!! Bubblegum Pop is NOT worth it.! Get out of there now and do it your way!!\\"  The way that it dealt with the issue of love was enjoyable; all her ventures in to that territory blows up in her face until finally she sees what(the reader sees from the beginning) was right in front of her. It also deals with some other issues pretty well, some things I don't personally agree with, but I guess they have to be dealt with anyways (and now that, several years after this was published, some of the news about some former male singers/boy band members, well, this book rings even truer).<br /><br />  I would say that in a sense Pop Princess is one of the most cliche riddled stories I have ever read, but it felt at least semi-believable because the growth she went through was realistic based on her circumstances (a sister dying, being pushed in to the spot light, and other things I will not reveal here) and even though this girl is only 17yrs when the book ends it seems like she's 30 or 40yrs just because all that she's been through; most grown adults wont even experience what she has been through, but while she goes through some extraordinary circumstances, she is still a growing teenage girl and has normal teenage experiences on top of the more adult ones.<br /><br />  Anyways if your Young Adult Dramas with a lot of drama, and lessons learned (as most are), then you will enjoy \\"Pop Princess\\".<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amybr /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-04-24

When you read the first 2 or 3 books, you may not be completely accustomed to the humor, and the way it uses this humor in order to give commentary of things such as child labor, people's obsession with fashion, and child abuse.  In the first book all the horrible events really do seem horrible!!! I know events in book 1 made me angry and devastated and frustrated all at the same time. After a few books, however, you begin to see the humor in each new situation.  Yes you will still get angry, but you'll find your self busting out laughing more than getting angry.<br /><br />  In book 1 we our introduced to the Baudelaire's, they are quite happy children that live with their parents in a large house, and are very rich. These children include: Violet, a 14 year old whom is a genius inventor, and will tie her up when in the midst of inventing, Klaus, her 12 year old brother whom is a genius of books, he can't get enough of them, and is quite often a well of information, and last but not least Sunny, a small baby whom is still crawling, can't really talk yet except with made up words, but she has for extremely long & sharp teeth.<br /><br />  The story goes, the Baudelare orphans were playing on the beach, when they became orphans(wont tell you how), this is where their misfortunes began, because they must live with a guardian now, a relative or something. Well, they end up living with Count Olaf, and really I don't want to tell you anything  more, it'll just spoil the books.<br /><br />  Well, anyways, it took me a while to really appreciate this series, I really didn't enjoy a lot until this year(I'm 19yrs), and I started reading these when I was 17yrs. I recently picked them up again after about a year's hiatus where I left off at book 3. After reading book 4, I was hooked. So my advice to you is, even if you don't REALLY enjoy these book at first, try picking them up again, because, well you might just find you appreciate them now as I do.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyem up again, because, well you might just find you appreciate them now as I do.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-04-22
US	45764909	R1ZO15CDWOFX46	1931514798	970250449	Kare Kano: His and Her Circumstances, Vol. 1	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A little bit rushed...	I had thought about reading this manga for a long time, and finally, I did. Although, I didn't expect to much of it. And I guess that's a good thing too.<br /><br />  Kare Kano is not a manga, the problem I have however, with the first volume, is how rushed it is. In fact if it would've taken 2 or 3 volumes for what happened in volume 1 to happen, it would've been much better. Because the change that happens between Arima and Yukino just happens to quickly. It doesn't seem very natural. I guess I might just be a bit used to drawn out mangas like [[ASIN:1569319960 Boys Over Flowers (Hana Yori Dango), Vol. 1]] that really take their time to tell a story and what happens with the characters.<br /><br />  Other then that, I think its good. I do like the concept of the whole \\"hidden lives\\" thing. Because for most of the human race we act completely different at home then we do around the general public. Although in this it is brought to an extreme level.<br /><br />  In Kare Kano we have Yukino, a girl who strives for the compliments of others, and therefore lives for hard work and over achievement. At home she mopes around in sweats, a bandana, and glasses, but in school she's \\"miss perfect\\". Her level of perfection is becoming eclipsed by Arima whom is the same at home as he is in public, because he not only wants the public to see him as perfection, but his family as well.<br /><br />  I'm sure you can guess where its heading, so I wont go on. But just because Volume 1 does not really live up to expectations, it does not mean you shouldn't read on, it does get better.  If you're expecting something super deep, don't look here, if however, you want an escape, look no further then \\"Kare Kano\\".<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-04-09

There are a lot of novels for Teens(especially teen girls), but few of them are truly worth reading. \\"Feeling Sorry for Celia\\", is one of those few teen books actually worth picking up. Its cynical, its witty, its funny, its heart warming, real yet fantastical in a way, and it stays totally true to its teenage characters, who seem like real people. Something I've only seen truly sucessfully pulled off in one other series [[ASIN:073935681X The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants]], and I've read many teen novels. This is one of those books that shows all the sides of the character and makes them likeable, even when they are mopey and complaining.  :D<br /><br />  Surprisingly enough, when I first saw \\"Feeling Sorry for Celia\\" is was an excerpt in \\"17 magazine\\", and I went to the library to get the book.  The funny thing is, I had know idea what was going on when I read the excerpt, I thought it was someone really talking, not a story!  Then I got the book, and needless to say I didn't like it.<br /><br />  That was about 2yrs ago. The thing that got me to get this book a go again, oddly enough, was that the second installment just came out.  I put it on hold at my library, so I decided I had to read this one first. Oddly enough, I don't know WHY I put it on hold either.  Secret Desire? Who knows...<br /><br />  I started reading it, it was a little depressing at first. I mean this girl Elizabeth Clarry, her friend Celia's run away for the ZILLIONTH time, but this time she hasn't even bothered to write  Elizabeth or call her. She's doing bad in school, she went skiing with her dad and has the worst sun burn! The book starts out with a letter from the \\"Association of Teenagers\\" that tells her to go hide in the refrigerator because she is a disgrace to teenagerdom.<br /><br />  The thing that turned me off from this book 2yrs ago was the way it is written. It is written entirely in letters, notes, postcard, faxes, ect. It really confused me when I first tried to read it(I was 17yrs at the time). When I picked it up now, I was able to understand it, and I couldn't put it down! It's just really exciting.  It reminds me a lot of a friendship I've had for the last 8yrs. Its been a little like Elizabeth's and Celia's, and she's  a flighty flake just like Celia.<br /><br />  Basically, this book is one of the best portraits of a female teenager and her feelings that I have read in a while. It is really honest, it feels like its coming from a real person, and it's not  trying to be all funny for the sake of being funny(ie. Princess Diairies and the Georgia Nicholson books), it just is.  All the things Elizabeth feels in this book, I have felt before, and I know exactly how she's feeling. I've been through those teenage years, they can suck majorly at times, but I think in a way, and I certainly don't miss them. :)<br /><br />  Anyways, if you're looking for something to lift you up and maybe make you feel a bit better or more at ease with your own awkward teenage years, or you have a fond remembrance of teenage years, or forgotten what its like, I suggest getting \\"Feeling Sorry for Celia\\" today!!!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amywas 17yrs at the time).

US	45764909	R3USVPU8HCVFUV	006009334X	887015576	Vampire Kisses	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Vampire Kisses: Nice coming of age novel	\\"Vampire Kisses\\", in a way, reminds me of the book [[ASIN:0739338978 Stargirl]]. The reasons it reminds me of \\"Stargirl\\" is: 1. They both deal with how people react to someone who does not fit cultural normalities.  2. They both tell a heart breaking story of adolescent love.<br /><br />  \\"Vampire Kisses\\" seemed quite mediocre st first.  This is because of the off-hand writing method that Ellen Scheiber has.  The writing style is very quick, dry, and to-the-point. Ellen Shreiber describes things very well, but in a way that is different than what I am accustomed too.<br /><br />  I picked up \\"Vampire Kisses\\" on a whim, I saw it in the book stores, and since I found Vampires intriguing, I decided to give it a try (1/31/13 this was written a while before the recent Vampire craze!).  I went to the library and placed a hold on it. While I was reluctant to read it, once I started reading it, I wanted to continue reading until the finish. It took me a few days to finish even though it is such a short novel because I was reluctant to finish it. I wanted it to be longer, it was all together too short.<br /><br />  \\"Vampire Kisses\\" tells the tale of of Raven a sixteen year old girl who lives in a dinky town she dubs Dullesville. Raven since she was 5yr, has had an obsession with monsters, particularly vampires.  She was so enraptured with vampires that when asked in Kindergarten what she wanted to be, she replied \\"A Vampire\\".  So, for the first thirty pages we follow Raven on her escapades as a young gothic outcast. She lives in a town where everybody knows everybody, and gossip goes around like wildfire.  She has never had a boyfriend (which is related to the way she dresses and carries herself), and the only friend she has is just as much of an outcast as her, but for different reasons.<br /><br />  Basically, \\"Vampire Kisses\\" follows Raven through the most vulnerable part of her life, the middle of her teen years. This book is frothy fun, but it has a heart too with a bittersweet ending;  I did shed a few tears. I could empathize with Raven, I was an outcast due to being home schooled and my Christian values, and hand-me-down clothing.<br /><br />  At first the love story between Alexander and Raven seemed phoney and unrealistic (which was probably the point), but as the book progressed it became more believable.  I wouldn't say that this was a life changing book like \\"Stargirl\\" was, but the similar story elements drew the comparisons for me.  \\"Vampire Kisses\\" is a fun story about being who you are when nobody appreciates who you are, and finding solace in something that's potentially dangerous much like \\"Stargirl\\".<br /><br />  I would recommend this book to any teenager. I am 19yrs, and I really enjoyed it!<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amytersweet ending;  I did shed a few tears.

I don't want to give it away, but I could not stop laughing. Sometimes I wonder how Count Olaf even gets away with things, he's just as dumb as all the other adults around, the only difference is that he's 10x's more evil. ;P<br /><br />  Book 4 only has a 4 star average, I'm not sure why, because I don't read reviews for things until I've reviewed them myself(that is unless I read the reviews before I read the book).  I have a feeling its because of the child labor issue, which is a very touchy issue.  The way that the head \\"Sir\\" of the Mill treats the children is abominable. How can you let children, let alone a baby work in a lumber mill? But so it goes. Not all the adults are like that, but all of them are clueless or too fearful to help the orphans.<br /><br />  This book, was the one that really hooked me in. Surprisingly enough, I didn't enjoy the last 3 very much.  I assume it is because I wasnot yet accustomed to Lemony Snicket's oddball humor. The intro to this book was the funniest out of all 13. It was hilarious.! I could not stop laughing.! The funny thing about these stories is that every person they go to live with, no matter how horrid they may be, they're able to take something from the experience and use against Count Olaf, even though he always wins.<br /><br />  As Lemony Snicket always warns, if you hate sad stories, and prefer happy endings, pick up another book, because this wont satisify you. But...If you enjoy dire situations, a little hope and major letdowns, and absolutely despicable villians, then you'll love this volume of Unfortunate Events.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2004-03-17

When I had got a Tokyopop manga sampler book (before I was into manga) for my brother, as a prize from a summer reading club in 2002, and I read through it to see if anything in there was worth reading. There were two mangas that caught my attention: 1. Mars by Fuyumi Soryo and 2. Paradise Kiss by Ai Yazawa.<br /><br />  Now, Paradise Kiss immedfiately caught my eye was because of the unique drawing style.  Since I initially read \\"Paradise Kiss\\" I have read hundreds of other series, and never have I seen a drawing style come close to Yazawa-san's.<br /><br />  So, finally  a year had passed since I read that sample of ParaKiss and after reading so much praise for the series; I got the first Volume for Christmas last year. Since I obtained it, I have read volume one about five different times (as well as started reading Gokinjo and more recently Nana 10/13/10).<br /><br />  What made ParaKiss so unique to me that I read and reread the first volume so many times?  Let me first give you a synopsis of the story:<br /><br />  The story goes: Yukari is a high school student who recieves a lot of pressure from her parents and fellow students and teachers in school to excel and get into a good college.  To Yukari if she is not placed in a good school; she is worthless.  It is because of this pressure, she has never even considered an alternative to college; so even though she hates where she is headed, she continues in the same direction. Until one day she is taking a walk and thinking, and a weird guy named Arashi with piercings all over his face, sees her and asked her to be a model, Yukari attempts to run away, but she is snatched up by a drag queen named Isabella. She passes out from the shock of Isabella and is taken to their hang out where she also meets Miwako, a tiny and cute girl who she mistakes for an angel at first (Miwako is wearing a backpack with wings on it).  They ask Yukari to model, she refuses, but cannot get these strange people out of her mind.<br /><br />  Ai Yazawa has a way with quick snappy dialogue and such a unique art style, that even though the story is somewhat run of the mill, it makes the story feel fresh and new.  This is what drew me into ParaKiss.  We can understand Yukari's struggle to find her own path in life and not just take the path others have laid out for her.  We can also understand her later attraction to George; the forbidden fruit.  However, there is one other element that makes ParaKiss such a delight to read:  the unique fashions!  Ai Yazawa shows off the many different styles of Tokyo including Lolita and punk, and Aristocratic as well.  If you enjoy Tokyo fashion you will enjoy ParaKiss for the fashion alone.<br /><br />  In some later volumes there is some sexual content, so I it is not very appropriate for those under 16. If you have not read ParaKiss yet, I highly reccomend it.  It is worth reading just for the breathtaking art.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amye refuses, but cannot get these strange people out of her mind.

I deserve some manga!!!\\", so I went in the store and was trying to decide which one to get and I decided \\"Well, I want something new, but not something to hard to follow, my brain is fried!!!\\". So picked out Flowers and Bees.<br /><br />  Flowers and Bees is the story of a young man named \\"Masao Komatsu\\", whom has very low self-esteem issues.  He is sick of girls making fun of him and calling him \\"Helmet Hair\\" and he is very uncomfortable with himself. He wants woman to fawn over him, he wants to look like a Bishonen(beautiful man), because he thinks it will bring him happiness. So he goes to the \\"World of Beautiful Men\\" a spa where some somewhat looney \\"men\\" help him become a beautiful man by over charging him and making him look worse(most of the time). They keep telling him he needs to get confidence in himself, and other people tell him this as well as not to care what others think.  Yet, he still believes his looks are the key to happiness.<br /><br />  I enjoyed Flowers and Bees so much because it has a very odd ball sense of humor, it is more adult(the rating is mature), but there isn't a ton of sex in it or anything, so I'm glad for that. :D<br /><br />  I would recommend Flowers and Bees to guys or girls, because I am a girl, and I thoroughly enjoyed, and my brother read it, and enjoyed it as well. We both laughed are rear-ends off! Its nice to have a guy uncomfortable with himself, I'm so used to reading Shoujo where girls are always the uncomfortable ones and its the guy that brings them \\"out of their shell\\" to complete them more or less.  I am a girl and I know what Masao is going through, and I know guys go through it to, so its nice to see insecurity portrayed from a young male perspective.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-03-13
US	45764909	R2DR41W47P9TRD	1591826853	280936716	Snow Drop Volume 2	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Snow Drop: Book #2, better then the first.	The first volume of Snow Drop was very melodramatic, but the 2nd volume is much more humorous.  While there is still a fair amount of melodrama, it is more down-played. Possibly it is because we have been introduced to the main characters and their problems, so now we can better follow their escapades without having quite as much drama.<br /><br />  In this Volume, the relationship between Hae-gi and So-na is really starting to heat up. However, as soon as their relationship starts going So-na's over protective father comes back home from a business trip.  Even though So-na has to be careful around her father, she is starting to feel that she can open up to Hae-gi, and that he's really not the monster she first thought him to be.  As all of this is Happening, So-na's friend Ha Da is still chasing after Ko Mo, he still has'nt realized that Ko Mo is not a girl, nor has So-na or Hae-gi bothered to tell him.<br /><br />  One of my favorite things about Snow Drop is the drawings. I adore  the art style, and the outrageous facial expressions the characters make, it is makes the comic hilarious despite the drama.  Most of the time that is what will make you laugh, the facial expressions.  At first the drawing style grated on my nerves because I was not used to the Korean drawing style, which is slightly different than the Japanese drawing style. However, once I adjusted to this drawing style I really began to enjoy it.  It is a pleasant change from what I normally see the drawing in manga, the Korean style is usually a little sharper or more angular.<br /><br />  If like me, you might have been put off by the first volume, please pick up the second, it will not let you down!  Volume 2 is much better, and there is romance in this volume, not an over saturation, but enough. There is also plenty plenty of fighting between the characters that continues from the first volume.  I am glad my feelings , about improving after the first Volume were right.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amynjoy* ~Amy	2004-03-10

Miki is taken aback by his calm and collected attitude, and fails to understanding how a living breathing human being could remain so calm in a crazy situation such as this.<br /><br />  On top of having to adjust to the changes in not only her parents marital life style, but her house hold life, she still has to deal with her school and normal life as a teenage as well as trying to move past the pain she feels every time she sees her close friend Ginta, whom she previously confessed her love to and was completely shut down.<br /><br />  Marmlade Boy may have soap operish themes, but that doesn't make it a Soap Opera in the traditional sense of the word, most soap operas either border on high camp or are completely devoid of humor all together, whereas this treats not only its characters and subject with a great deal of sensitivity, but is also very aware of the absurdity of its premise and gives most of the situations a knowing wink and a good sense of humor/satire, and I found this continues on in to the later Volumes, which, believe it or not, contain even more sensitive subject matter.<br /><br />  It is also more than a little refreshing to see young characters that look their age and aren't either exaggeratingly beautiful (whether male or female) or look 10x's older then they are.  The majority of the characters are High School freshman, and they look like High School Freshman!<br /><br />  I highly recommend not only Volume 1, but the entire Marmalade Boy Series, it is funny, touching, and thought-provoking and worth reading regardless of what kind of manga you may normally prefer.  :)<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amyolder then they are.

If you look you can even see a fairly big difference in the quality of drawings between volumes 1 & 4, and the drawings just keep getting better and better, Domiyogi eventually loses his \\"Marie Antionette\\" hair, and of course the early 90's styles get the boot too(hehe). So even if those are things that bug you about HYD, stick with it, not only do the drawings get better, but so does the story. :D<br /><br />  In Volume 4 we come back to where we left off in Volume 3, Shizuka announcing her leaving Japan forever AND cutting off her georeous hair at her own birthday party (I suggest NOT reading this paragraph anymore if you DON'T want ANYTHING spoiled. Otherwise, read on. :D).  Since Shizuka is leaving, Tsukushi is torn between her feelings for Rui, she knows if Shizuka leaves, she can have him all to herself, but she also really likes Shizuka because she's been nothing but kind.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, as Shizuka leaves on her plane, Domiyogi ask for a date, but Tsukushi can't hear over the airplanes, he then tells her later when and where to meet him, but she's like \\"Ummmm What is he talking about?\\".  This time Tsukushi feels obligated to meet him, yet she doesn't really want to....<br /><br />  I'd like to tell you more, but it would just ruin it. So I wont! All I can tell you is, that for the next 20 Volumes or so, you'll be riding the roller coaster of your life!<br /><br />  If there is one thing I hate about Hana Yori Dango it is this: Once you stop reading, YOU DON'T WANT TO STOP! And at this rate Viz wont have all the volumes out for 6yrs, so if you can't wait, like me, I suggest finding the Japanese books(you can find them pretty cheap on Sasugabooks.com) and looking up some translations, or finding scanslations(or going on Ebay to get them). Because this series leaves you hanging in pretty much EVERY SINGLE volume. So when I think that Japan had to wait 10yrs for the series to finish, damn!!!<br /><br />  All-in-all I would rank Boys Over Flowers(Hana Yori Dango), as my absolute fav manga, and quite possibly my favorite romance tale of all times(Ranking up there with Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice).  Tsukushia and Tsukasa are my favorite couple.  Not only that but reading this manga has also made me think a lot, especially in the later volumes.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyn had to wait 10yrs for the series to finish, damn!!!<br /><br />  All-in-all I would rank Boys Over Flowers(Hana Yori Dango), as my absolute fav manga, and quite possibly my favorite romance tale of all times(Ranking up there with Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice).

As of this date I have only a read \\"Wrinkle\\" though, so I cannot vouch for the other books and their quality.<br /><br />  For the time that it was written (the 1960's) \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" creates some fairly realistic people, and with those people, destroys a lot of illusions that we create for ourselves, such as the illusion of an omnipotent figure (Much like JK Rowling does with Dumbledore in Harry Potter)being destroyed. It also deals with finding your place in the world, even if in this case, it means traveling to other worlds to do it.<br /><br />  Meg Murry, who is our narrative voice, is a stubborn, hard-head High School Freshman, she is a misfit, and everyone considers her to be quite the invalid; she lets herself believe these things to be true as well. Her 10yr twin brothers, Sandy and Denys, are considered \\"normal\\" and they fit in very well, her younger brother Charles Wallace 5yrs, like her is considered to be a moron by people outside of the family, for the reason that he normally doesn't verbalize outside of his own family (10/23/10 funnily enough my God Son is a lot like this, though he is 3yrs). Charles is still obviously a child, but he holds a lot of knowledge, intelligence, and special communication abilities that a rare few people have.<br /><br />  The Murry family have not heard from their father for 2yrs, no one knows why, one day his letters just stopped.  At the time, he had been working on a top secret project for the government, and due to his sudden vanishment and non-communication, everyone outside of the family is convinced that he ran off with another woman.<br /><br />  All of this sounds quite ordinary, and this is all part of the set-up for something that turns out to be not quite as ordinary as the first few pages make you believe.  There is quite a bit of adventure and chivalry and the characters going outside their comfort zone.  I will not divulge the details of what that is, I will merely say that it is quite an adventure that defies time and space.  ;P<br /><br />  Although primarily a children's book, it does deal with quite a few themes that people often attempt to shield their children from, especially the idea of adultery.  It is the themes that makes this more than just an interesting sci-fi book for children, and they mostly deal with the idea of fitting in, appreciation, over and under estimations of one's abilities and others, holding on to your beliefs in the face of opposition, discovering your own strengths and weaknesses, and growing up wholly misunderstood.  I would say for its deft treatments of these themes, it is well worth reading to children or letting them read it and at least talking to them about it after words.<br /><br />  The reason I recommend reading it with your children, because some of the themes, depending on their age, may not be something they catch, but they are things that are very relevant to any adolescent and well, any adult as well, as I know many adults who still struggle with the things Meg does.  So very well worth a read even just for curiosity's sake.  :)<br /><br />  God Belss ~Amy<br /><br />  God Bless & *Enjoy*of the family is convinced that he ran off with another woman.

NOTE:  Revised grammatically and structurally on Saturday October 23, 2010.<br /><br />Fruits Basket or Furuba as it is known to fans, is something that many fans of manga have been anticipating for a long time. I myself, had only just heard of it last December. At the time that I read the first volume, I had no understanding or knowledge of the plot/storyline for this series, I had merely heard it was \\"amazing\\", and I found that the expectations in my head and what it actually ended up being were two vastly different things.<br /><br />  Fruits Basket, if you have not heard the plot yet, is about a girl named Tohru Honda whom is an orphan.  She is currently living in a tent because her grandfather is fixing up his house so other relatives can live in it as well. She doesn't want to trouble anyone, so she decides to rough it for those couple of months in a tent. She accidentally ends up camping on the property of the Sohma family. A group of young men whom find her and decide to take her in for the night, but she soon finds out that they are a cursed family. Each of them represents a member of the Zodiac and one of them is the cat, the one who didn't get to go the banquet.  :(  Tohru has always been fascinated with the Zodiac and especially with the cat, she always wished that her sign could be the cat.  She soon finds out about their cursed and when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they turn into the Zodiac animal they represent. Straying away from normal protocol, they decide not to erase her memory and let her stay with them.  While with them she does chores and cooks for them, and begins like this is her home.<br /><br />  Needless to say, this is NOT what I had thought Fruits Basket was, but I found it very intriguing and fun to learn about the Chinese Zodiac. Although plot is pretty fluffy that is what it is intended to be, it is not meant to be brain food.  The only thing that detracted from the fun was how thinly the men are drawn, their build is akin to that of a 50lbs anorexics body to be honest, which is not very attractive.<br /><br />  All-in-all, I would say Fruits Basket is a quality Shojo manga, and lived up to my expectations by being something I completely did not expect and still turning out to be very good. I will continue to follow the series. :D<br /><br />  UPDATE 10/23/10:  Actually, I tried reading further volumes, but I found it too devoid of well, any substance for me to really enjoy reading it any further.  Now, this does not mean that those looking for some escapism wont enjoy it, but I tend to enjoy stories with at least a little bit to chew on after I close the book, but almost 8yrs later, I have not forgotten it, so that does say something about the quality of the series for what it is.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyof a 50lbs anorexics body to be honest, which is not very attractive.

NOTE: Revised Grammitcally and Structurally on Saturday October 23, 2010<br /><br />  When I first started reading GunSlinger Girl, it was very difficult for me to get into. It wasn't something that exactly grabs you from the get-go. Even though the story-line is intriguing in itself; I had to get used to the story-telling style. Once I did get used to the story-telling style, I got so caught up in it that I could not put it down until I was done. I still can't wait to read volume two(And normally I'm a Shoujo girl).<br /><br />  The idea of taking girls whom have been physically and/or mentally maimed from accidents and turning them into assassins is both a brilliant and brutal idea. Such a story as this easily could have fallen flat on its face, but Gunslinger Girl does not. The thing that makes Gunslinger Girl work so well is that these girls have to struggle with their emotions just like any girl. Even though their memories have been washed clean away, they are still girls. And they struggle between trying protect their partners, not letting emotions get involved in work, and making friends(or rather not) with outsiders.<br /><br />  Gunslinger girl is a very engrossing drama story, it really gets you involved in not only in the lives of each girls story, but also their partners and with the complications that come with such a \\"project\\".<br /><br />  I would recommend Gunslinger Girl to anyone who wants a manga that has great characters, tight storytelling, and nice artwork. I don't think you'll think of little girls the same ever again.  I also recommend not letting anyone below 16yrs read this because of violent and graphic content as well as heavy themes, that will probably fly over a younger person's head, or just disturb them.<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2004-01-28

NOTE:  Revised Grammatically and Structurally on Saturday October 23, 2010.<br /><br />While this book is, of course, geared towards musical theater and those interested in it, there are many tips in here that can be used for any kind of audition and it also gives tips and guide lines for those who may not be singers per say, but are primarily actors but are still interested in pursuing a role in a musical.<br /><br />  I decided to find books on acting last year and I stumbled across this one while I was in the library scouring the shelves for any book on acting, acting methods, or auditions.<br /><br />  At the time I wasn't auditioning for any musicals, but I started reading it anyways as I was certain it would be helpful in the future when I do audition (10/23/10 I can now say that it has been). I didn't think much of it though, I mean I thought it was helpful, but I wasn't able to see its true practicality at the time because I was reading it for future use, and that is probably a good thing because with things of this nature, it is good to give your self ample time to process the material so it can be put in to practice.<br /><br />  I found this book extremely useful because it helps you to determine exactly how and when you should move while performing a song for musical theater, which has been one of my, if not, my biggest problem in musical theater when audition or entering competitions. Mastering the blocking part alone will help anyone stand out in an audition, as many amateurs make the mistake of either not moving at all or moving too much, and if you are pursuing a professional career that is never going to get you a part no matter how good you can sing. Through learning these things I was able to help myself become more confident in my own abilities because my abilities became stronger and more polished, obviously this does not get rid of nerves, but it certainly helps ease them.<br /><br />  I would recommend this book to any actor along with \\"Audition\\". These two books alone will help give you knowledge, but  they are no supplement for the actual experience you will get in an audition and from a good theater teacher and voice teacher. I also highly recommend the book \\"The Actor Speaks\\", that book contains around 20 different actors talking about their own personal technique, how they learned to be able to act effectively, it is a very entertaining and informative read.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyill help give you knowledge, but  they are no supplement for the actual experience you will get in an audition and from a good theater teacher and voice teacher.

In Volume 3 of Boys over Flowers, if you had ANY doubts of Domiyogi liking Tsukushi, they will END here in Vol. 3.  I personally knew it from Vol. 1, but his feelings in this book seem to have grown exponentially.<br /><br />  I don't want give to much away, but after Domiyogi kissed Tsukushi while on the Yacht party, as usual(pretending he does not care for her) he says that she kissed him.  It was dark, and its Domiyogi, so no one will argue with that. Tsukushi is absolutely mortified, but yet somehow after that kiss, she said it was like the best day she's had in a long time.  Could it be because she really cares about Domiyogi?  And just like him, wont admit it?<br /><br />  Throughout Vol. 3, we get examples of what makes Domiyogi and Tsukishi alike, even though their upbringing is so different:<br /><br />  1. They're both EXTREMELY hard headed. - We have seen throughout the series just how hard-headed Domiyogi is, but also more subtley how hard-head Tsukushi is.  She obviously has to be to put up with the F4 and stick with what she believes in.  Not only that, but just like Domiyogi, she wont admit her feelings.  It is becoming more apparent that she likes him, but she hasn't even realized it yet because she wont give the idea a chance to sit in her brain. As soon as it appears, she quickly dismisses it.<br /><br />  2. We are given clear examples of how violent they are. -They are both willing to hurt people when they see fit.  Domiyogi has often seemed more cruel and extreme, and in this book he really flies off the handle and goes crazy, but so does Tsukushi.  The same line is given when the worst case happens \\"You're going to kill him!!!\\". So this must be linking the two together more.  In that same seen, one of the F4 compare Tsukushi's violent behavior to Domiyogi, saying she's \\"As bad as he is\\".<br /><br />  3. They're both too proud. - The reason Domiyogi wont admit his feelings because he has a reputtion to live up to, he always calls the less-privelaged rude names. Were he to admit his feelings for Tsukushi he would be saying he was wrong, and once again he's to hard-headed for that. In the first book we see him trying to transform Tsukushi to make her more \\"acceptable\\". Now he doesn't exactly say that, but I believe because of his pride he felt that dating her or hanging out with her wouldn't be a problem if she were rich, or at least looked it.<br /><br />  Tsukushi is to proud to mingle with the Richies as well, as we see in the beginning. Now we have only been given examples of a--hole rich kids, until Kazuya, her old childhood friend came in. But he was not born rich, so its not the same.  Shizuka however has been the only example so far of a nice rich kid. The thing is, in the beginning we saw that because of Tsukushi's pride she didn't want to look for nice rich kids, she assumed they were all jerks, all she wanted to do was coast through. Of course had that happened, this series would've been extremely boring. :p<br /><br />  So as of Volume 3, based on that stuff alone, it looks like something is already cooking between Domiyogi and Tsushuki, and maybe in the next couple Volumes something will actually happen, because Domiyogi and Tsukushi are quite different, yet they also have a lot in common, so it is possible once they both get over themselves, they'll find love. At least, that's what I think. :D<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyaged rude names. Were he to admit his feelings for Tsukushi he would be saying he was wrong, and once again he's to hard-headed for that.

She will be attending Seisyu Academy, and can't wait to try on the \\"famously cute\\" outfit, when she finds out that her father registered her as a boy and cooked up a scheme so that she would play on the boys basketball team and become the basketball player he always wanted to be.  Aizawa grew up playing b-ball with her father, but all she wants to do now is quit and get a boyfriend and wear the GIRLS Seisyu uniform.<br /><br />  When she gets to Seisyu, she meets Eniwa Chiharu, a moody guy with a bad temper and a lot of passion for the game of basketball. He ends up being on the basketball team with her, and sparks fly. Then they end up becoming roommates as well. They just can't seem to get along, but there is a secret behind why Chiharu is acting all moody and cranky, and Aizawa wants to get to the bottom of it, which is part of what bugs Chiharu so much.<br /><br />  We've seen the scenario of a woman dressing up as a man or a man dressing up as a woman billions of times. What makes \\"Girl Got Game\\" different and worth reading, is that, it focuses on her relationships and girl problems instead of how funny it is to dress up like man like in most of the stories with this scenario. It also centers around Chiharu as well, not just her, and the comedy develops mostly from her trying to behave like a guy and fit in.<br /><br />  Yes the description and name of girl got game make it sound like an extremely generic story. And if that is why you were hesitant to get \\"Girl Got Game\\", never fear, though it is generic,  it has a lot of heart, and it is quite funny.  I have good feelings about this new manga, its already very good, and I have the feeling that it will only get better with time.

And instead of being called manga, it is called \\"manhwa\\".<br /><br />  Personally, this is my first Korean manga or \\"manhwa\\", and I very much enjoyed it.  It was a little hard to get into at first. Mostly because the drawing style was different, a little more crude then I'm used to. Not bad drawings, it just seemed less glossy, more gritty.  I believe that was the artist intention.<br /><br />  The back cover claims that it is a Rome & Julietesque style romance. That is a pretty deceiving description of this book.  Let me give you a run-down of some of what happens in Vol. 1:<br /><br />  We meet So-na a (rich)girl whom has quit school so that she can take care of her nursery full time. It is the only thing in her life that really matters to her.  Each flower is special to her, and has a special meaning, but then her father forces her into attending school again when he threatens to destroy her nursery. :(<br /><br />  Her friend Ha-da whom also quit school is being forced to go back. As soon as they get there Ha-da announces to the class that he is the coolest person there. Then they take seats and So-na ends up sitting next to the quiet pretty boy \\"Hae-gi\\". He is unfriendly and fairly rude, but when he sees So-na covering for someone at a floral shop when he comes in to purchase some flowers, he finds her attractive, but also annoying as she goes on and on about the meaning of flowers and such.  This establishes the conflict, she now sees him as haughty and stuck-up, and he sees her as a prissy flower-obsessed girl, but when Ha-da comes up with a plan to get Hae-gi back So-na is determined to make sure it works out.<br /><br />  There is a lot more to it then that, but I don't want to give the whole thing away, I just wanted to give you a taste of what the this volume is really like, it hasn't really got any romance in it, but it seems quite probable there will be some in Volume 2.<br /><br />  Since this was my first Manhwa and I enjoyed it quite a bit, then you may to consider whether or not you've read Manhwa before, and if this one should be your first. The characters are strong, the plot is familiar, but still good and holds interest, and its good enough for me to want Vol. 2.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amys my first Manhwa and I enjoyed it quite a bit, then you may to consider whether or not you've read Manhwa before, and if this one should be your first.

I liked it, but at the same time, I didn't. Then I found as time went on, I liked it more and more.  I began eagerly anticipating Volume 2. I was lucky enough to find a copy of it yestarday(Jan. 11) at the bookstore. As soon as I saw it, I HAD to get it. It was very eager to know what would happen with the Hatsumi, Ryoki, and Azusa triangle.<br /><br />  The thing is, with Volume 2, I can't really say too much, because it will give it away. I will only tell you that you will never expect what unfolds in Volume 2.<br /><br />  If you thought Volume 1 was great, you will be ecstatic about Volume 2!  I'm completely hooked now, I CAN'T wait for Volume 3 to come out (who knows when that will be). The way this manga is, it really took it up a step. The characters are growing way beyond what we already know of them and turn out being completely different then what we thought, and the plot is becoming more and more intriguing. The triangle between Hatsumi, Ryoki, and Azusa is getting extremely complicated in a great way. :D<br /><br />  Even if you weren't entirely fond of Volume 1, I suggest picking up Volume 2. Its ABSOLUTELY worth EVERY single penny.! If you're let down, you must have something wrong with you. hehe Naw, just kidding. Then again..... ;)<br /><br />  God  Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy	2004-01-12

There are many series of manga or books that tend to decline in their quality as the series goes on. However, that is not the case with Wild Act.  That is why Wild Act has become one of my very favorite series in manga.<br /><br />  If you read my reviews for the last 3 volumes, then you know the story up until Volume 4. We were left off with a cliff-hanger ending in Volume 3, and Volume 4 leads off from exactly where Vol. 3 left us hanging at.<br /><br />  Yuniko jumped off the cliff in order to obtain the tape that could prove Akira Nanae is her father, and Ryu jumped in after her to save her.  This confirms firms to Yuniko just how much Ryu cares for her, and so one he tells her that it wasn't the real tape, she makes a promise that as soon as they find it and she hears it, she will be all his, so they go on the hunt for the tape.<br /><br />  I would like to tell you a lot more, but I think it is best to leave at least some of the storyline for you to unravel on your own as you read the 4th installment of Wild Act.  It is worth it, absolutely completely, and gives us plenty of funny moments, action, romance, and intelligence. Not to mention another ending that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the 5th Volume.!<br /><br />  So until Volume 5, God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amy	2004-01-11

Nope, Wild Act is first-rate manga. And here's why:<br />  The cover may decieve you, but don't let it.! The first Volume we are introduced to Yunika, a total fanatic of the late actor Akira Nanae, the first and only Japanese Actor to ever really cross-over into America. Yuniko is on a mission to get back EVERYTHING that Akira Nanae EVER owned, and to do so, she must steal his belongings from homes, studios, and banks. On a mission to gain Akiras Golden Academy Award, she attends the awards, but she set up the wrong dressing room, because she never thought Ryu Eba(The New Nanae), would win the award. And so they meet, and at first it seems he is just out to cause her trouble and annoy her by throwing obstacles left-to-right to keep her from gather her idols belongings. Soon Yuniko is worried she may be getting off-focus of collecting Akira's belongings, because her mind keeps going back to Ryu.<br />  To find out the rest, you have to read it.! I really CAN'T do the series justice by summarizing this first volume, but just trust me, give the series a shot, I love it(I'm a girl), and my brother and his friend love it too. There's plenty of action and twist in the plot to keep guys interested, and a love story for the mushy headed girls. :D<br />  God Bless &amp; *Enjoy* ~Amy	2004-01-01

UPDATED Monday June 20, 2016, for grammatical issues, the original review is from 2003:<br /><br />This is a difficult book story and it is not an easy read. It is from the 17th Century and is a very feminist piece of literature from that era, far predating Jame Austen or the Bronte Sisters, and part of the reason I'm writing this review, is because the reviewers on Amazon (for the most part), are missing the point of The Female Quixote.<br /><br />Yes, it is a little bit ironic that Charlotte Lennox was crowned the first female American Novelist, when she only lived in America for about 6yrs, but not only are the Amazon reviewers missing the novels point, but also the person whom introduces the book in this edition.<br /><br />I don't mean to give away the ending, but I studied this in my American Lit. Class at college for 2 weeks. It seems that by the way the book ends, we get a few things pointed out from what seems to be a cheap cop-out:<br /><br />When Arabella is being talked to by the Doctor, he is giving her reasonable reasons as to why she is wrong. The others just told her it was silly, and in a way reinforcing her beliefs. The Doctor, however, is showing her why what she believes can't be true, and not only that, but by this ending we see that the females in these times had 3 options: 1. Be what we see as a Coquette, in Miss Glanville, excepting, unhappy marriage for money, and what society hands them or 2. In the case with Miss Groves, she has been impregnated twice, and in no inconvenience to the man she hopes to marry, which will probably be an unhappy one as well. She has chosen to rebel against society, and she is forced to live life in hiding. Why? Because doing anything besides doing what you are told to do, and marrying well, is considered abnormal. 3. Create a fantasy or dare to think outside the box and get committed and put in an insane assylum for not conforming to society's idea of what a women should be. The women has in this 18th century society has zero rights in this regard, and this ending truly shows that.<br /><br />Then on the other hand in Arabella's case, by the end of the book she has to options. 1. Admit one is wrong and go into Holy Matrimony with Mr. Glanville or 2. Continue on with her &#34;delusion&#34;, and unfortunately most likely be committed and put in an insane assylum. Not much of a choice really, so in a way, the ending and the book as a whole is showing us the choices that these woman had back then. This book is a difficult read, and the ending is not a pat or happy ending, in fact, it is almost morbidly depressing. We should be infinitely thankful we have so many choices now, because most woman back then had very few choices.<br /><br />Someone said that this book was horrible because of the ending, and that it was nothing compared to the novels written a century later by Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte. However, it is likely that Charlotte Lennox probably inspired women to think of what their choices are and maybe try to change the way life was for them. Maybe she even inspired Bronte and Austen. Who knows? While I love both Austen and Bronte, Lennox was an important author as well. Credit should be given to where and whom it is do.<br /><br />Unlike these other readers, you can gain some insight into the world the 18th century women through this book.<br /><br />My hats off to Mrs. Lennox for being bold and showing the hypocrisies of her day.<br /><br />God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amyciety has zero rights in this regard, and this ending truly shows that.<br /><br />Then on the other hand in Arabella's case, by the end of the book she has to options. 1.

It seems real.<br /><br />  The first Volume of CC has 2 stories, one dealing with suicide and the other dealing with a girl who's taken a lot of wrong turns(leading to prostitution). The Second Volume of CC has one story, and it deals with the touchy issue of Sexual Harassment.<br /><br />  After reading the story of Suzuki, a girl who is passionate about tennis and is attending an All-girls school known for its Tennis program which is coached by Todo, a man who sees no wrong in feeling up his students or having them do such chores as pulling his gray hairs, massaging him, or cleaning out his ears in private, it is more than a little disturbing to read about this \\"teacher\\" and what he does to his students.<br /><br />  She just wants to play tennis, and so do the other girls, but soon Todo's advances become more frequent and his remarks more embarrassing as the Inter-High tournament is coming closer and closer. He often commenting about their virginity or period. Making them feel inferior. He doesn't understand the rights of a human being, he believes as long as he doesn't \\"seem\\" to have an ulterior motive its \\"okay\\", to him, unless he's physically abusing them, its okay.<br /><br />  The Second Volume of Confidential Confessions is what Women's Rights are really about!  Not about burning bras or fighting to be let into a golf club or whatever. No, what its really about is woman who have REAL problems, and making them known, and getting people aware. Problems like sexual harassment go on everyday, and we just let them pass all the time. I've been a victim to it more times then I can even count, I wasn't always as vocal about it as I should have been either.<br /><br />  Confidential Confessions doesn't give you the answers, but it does give you some insight into some issues that have been going on for years.  Only in recent times have these issue begun to get noticed. If you like real stories, with real problems, and real people then you will like Confidential Confessions.<br /><br />  Its disturbing details are not glossed over and the stories don't seem forced or contrived, but fresh and real (unlike shows such as [[ASIN:B0002HOEKS Degrassi: The Next Generation - Season One]]).

I was immediately drawn into Shutterbox when I saw an add for it. The pretty, yet mysterious guy on the cover intrigued me, and since my brother had the first Volume, I figured I'd give it a shot. At first, I wasn't sure what I thought about it. In fact I didn't like it much at all really. And I was sad because the guy on the cover cuts his hair. :( hehe Okay, so I'm a dork, sue me.! :p Anyways, as others have said, the story is intrigueing:<br />  A girl named Megan has been having weird dreams lately. She's been unsure what to do with her life, and she's been seeing people or things that she's not sure are real, her mother sends her to a psyciatrist, doesn't help much though. But then one night when she goes to bed she discovers just how real it is. That she has been chosen to be a Shutterbox, an exchange student at Merridiah Univrsity where dead people are trained to be muses, and she is there to be trained as a living muse.<br />  The characters are interesting enough, I really like Adrien, I hope to see his character grow. And I REALLY *hope* to see Megan grow out of somewhat typical manga-girl character she is right now, and become something that is a more 3-dementional. Not say she's a flat character, but I was more intrigued with Damien and Adrien then I was her. What kept me reading was knowing that I would see Adrien. And that the plot itself is very interesting.<br />  Shutterbox seems like a very promising manga, I have a feeling it will only get better once the characters are giving room to breath and live. I did like the chapter names and pics though. Esp. the title &quot;Quixotic&quot; made me think, that maybe this is more poking fun at the typical manga, and celebrating them as well, by having Megan be the sort of character she is. If you are familiar with Don Quixote or the Female Quixote(which I studied in college), then you will know that they are characters transfixed with a romance novels and detimerined to live the lives of the romance characters. I think in a way, that is what the authors here are doing. :D<br />  Well that's my bit, you may or may not like Shutterbox, that my friend, is up to you.<br />  God Bless &amp; *Enjoy* ~Amy<br />  PS: The artowrk takes getting used to.omance characters.

It is very good, I just finished Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, both are amazingly great.! As this is a review page for Vol. 1. I will proceed to review that volume alone, and will save the Vol. 2 Review for another day.<br />  First, Confidential Confessions is not all dark and horrible. Yes, it is dark, but its not dark to be dark. Its presenting real-life issues. Maybe some issues everyone has struggled with in one time or another(Suicide, depression, feeling unwanted, helplessness, ect.), and it does it in a way that's not preachy or phoney. The characters are very real, they may be going through hard times, but you understand their problems and you care about them. They are not presented as people in these situations are usually presented: As flat, and people whom are completely self-absorbed. Obviously these people are self-involved, but so are all of us, these people are in the skids of life, just like we all hit sooner or later, or maybe we're in our whole life. But in the first story of the first Vol. these girls are sick of the way the world is, they want to make a difference in it. And I know exactly how they feel. I've been going through the exact same stuff as them. hehe And the scene at Asparagus' funeral, that just made me so mad, the way the girls, and everyone else acted. She wanted to make a difference by dying, but it all remained exactly the same... And be insight is to be found.<br />  The second story makes me really sad, it really made me think a lot. Yoshioka had a broken home life, she thought it would be better to live life on her own terms and do what she wants, so she left home at 13. So she turns to prostitution to make quick cash, the no-commitment sex gives her her fix without having to give them her name. And she is okay doing this until she meets Ryo, a guy who plays guitar on the streets, and takes her in without asking for anything in return. She changes the way she thinks more by what he doesn't do, then by what he does. But it is the decisions she makes after he has begun to change her that made me cry. :( The consequenses seemed all to real, as my friends mother is a counselor at JDH. :(<br />  Don't let my descriptions turn you off, because these stories are really good. They will make you think, maybe even lend you a new perspective. So don't be shy, give Confidential Confessions a try today.! :D<br />  God Bless & *Enjoy* ~Amyat he does.

In Hot Gimmick A girl(Hatsumi) finds out that her younger, but promiscuous sister(Akane) may be pregnant so she does her the favor of buying her a pregnancy test. While buying it, her manipulative neighbor(Ryoki) threatens to spill the secret to his mother whom is the tenant of the apartment complex they live in which is a housing complex for employees of the company her father works for, unless she promises to become his sex slave. And she does so, even though she hates the guts out of him, only for the sake of her sister.  Then her old childhood friend(and now model) Azusa comes back, and promises to protect her from Ryoki.<br />  Hot Gimmick is a step ahead of other Shojo, because its focus is closer to real-life and in the first volume it is more comedy focused then other more dramatic, but equally good mangas - Mars and Wild Act. Hot Gimmick is kind of like watching your own life unfold. And that is where this manga really gets under my skin.<br />  The guys in it seem so much like the real guys I meet everyday that I really wanted to punch them. Take Azusa, he's your typical sweet guy whom is completely clueless to the fact that this girl totally likes him, EVEN THOUGH its RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS FACE!!!!! Yes, Azusa likes Hatsumi, but he can't see that she likes him(like the other person whom corrected me said, its mostly because of Ryoki). And I just *hope* that Azusa will look beyond whats in front of him and see that Hatsumi really wants him too. Then you have Ryoki, he's basiclly your typical a--hole guy, except you feel sorry for him because he's so desperate, but then he's also annoying because for some reason he keeps saying \\"I can't stand that girl, I don't know exactly why, but she really bugs me.\\" and that he keeps calling her stupid, but I don't think its just because he's looking for someone to vent about his own stupidity on(not good), but also because, like Subura suggest, he holds a secret crush for Hatsumi. ;) But I think its the fact that these guys are so real, well, that's part of what makes this manga work so well.!<br />  All in all, Hot Gimmick is for teens prolly 16+ I wouldn't give it to anyone younger then that, as there is quite a bit of adult content in this. No nudity or actual sex(in this volume). But there is a lot of stuff involving sex. It is for the more mature reader. I recomend for someone looking for a good manga that is a little bit different, one that is a little more realistic then most mangas, but still maintains a good sense of humor and absurdity. Volume 2 can't come soon enough!!!<br />  *Enjoy* & God Bless ~Amythese guys are so real, well, that's part of what makes this manga work so well.!<br />       All in all, Hot Gimmick is for teens prolly 16+ I wouldn't give it to anyone younger then that, as there is quite a bit of adult content in this.

It is a very good romantic story so far(I'm on Vol. 3). This volume picking up where Volume 1 left off, Yuniko is falling hard for Ryu Eba(The New Nanae), but is still unwilling to give up her obsession with the real Akira Nanae, whom is dead. We come to see just how much Ryu cares about Yuniko, and what is behind Yuniko's obsession with Akira Nanae.<br />  Wild Act follows the typical romantic formula of a girl falling for a guy whom seems like her most unlikely match and what follows is uncovering a lot of the past secrets and a turbulent romance, but Wild Act does this well, and it has some fun characters such as Sanae(The usual guy whom looks a lot like a girl), and her pet squirrels Kumui and Cinnamon.<br />  So Wild Act is above par for most romantic mangas I'd say. It has nice art work, a good sense of humor, a strong female lead(A girl whom can kick major bootay and is a theif extrordinare), and some good supporting characters.<br />  If you *enjoy* romantic mangas or manga in general, you should like Wild Act, its funny, heartwarming, turbulent, and has a bit of action as well. hehe :D<br />  Be SURE to start at Vol. 1 and *Enjoy*!!!!<br />  God Bless ~Amy	2003-12-27

Bad Boy/Good Girl get together and have turbulent relationship.<br />I've only read to volume 9(And that's only because I can't buy them all at once!). As of today that's what I've read to. And I've loved Mars, its not only addictive, but its worth being addicted to!!<br />A lot of the characters do start out stereotypically, but I think they really break from those stereotypes with a lot of character development. I really understand where Kira is coming from. Maybe that person thinks she's damsle-distressy. And maybe she is, but some people are like that. Or wish they were(Despite all the feminime crap that we shouldn't be like that and are'nt like that stuff.). I mean I've been through some stuff similar to Kira. And well I guess unless you've been through it you may not think her actions are realistic or whatever. But I really saw a lot me in her.<br />Whether or not its a pretty overused story-line, I think Mars is a *great* Manga. The characters(Like Harumi, I thought she seemed all B**** at first, and she'd be the typical girl you love to hate, but she ends up being really nice and one of my fav characters. :D) to me are quite intrueging(And no, I'm not a sheltered little kid, I, in fact make studying people my hobby. :D). And I'm always wondering what will happen next, I figure they'll probrably end up together in the end, but maybe they wont. Either way I'm more concerned with what happens along the way.<br />So I say you should give Mars a shot, if you've never read manga before its great place to start!! Its made me think a lot about myself, and make me try to get over some things in the past. So it can't be all bad. :D<br />Well, also, its not for everyone because there is quite a bit of vulgarity, violence, and sexuality. So beware, but *enjoy*.! :)<br />God Bless ~Amy	2003-11-27

UPDATED Monday June 20, 2016 for Sturctural and Grammatical errors, as well as a further explanation for why the Review has the view point it does:<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW from 2002:<br /><br />  I thought &#34;Wish&#34; was a very good Manga series, and it is a very cute story about an angel coming to earth and falling in love with a man, I had to read all 4 volumes extremely in a single day. It was really good, and typical clamp with a lot of gender bending,  The romance was done well, and I wanted to get to the next Volume at the end of each one, it kept me fully interested, and although the characters do not have a lot of depth, they were still somewhat interesting.<br /><br />I do want to know that when this was originally released in 2002, I was not aware this was originally a male-on-male manga, because when translated, the angel was portrayed as female,  if when translated in to English in 2002,  they had kept it male-male, I would not have read it to begin with, I felt tricked when I found this out. Just because I don't believe in that sort of stuff does not make me a bigot, people are free to make their choices, but I do not have to agree with it.<br /><br /> I am a Bible believing Christian, and I want to warn anyone in the Otaku community who is not in to slash or Yoai that this is what this manga is, despite what some may think, not everyone agrees with male to male or female to female relationships and should be warned before picking up a manga that has them.  If it doesn't bother you, fine, but don't neg me just because you disagree, that only shows your intolerance.<br /><br />  You know what really annoys me, is all the people who like male-on-male stuff who think that those who don't like it, need to grow up.

I received as a present for my 11th birthday(I am now 18) from my sister(Whom is 7yrs my elder). Needless to say I fell in love with it.!<br /><br /> Setting: Two young sisters who live in their house with their parents. The elder is driven nuts by her little sister who demolishes her dolls and stuff(With good intentions :p).<br /><br /> Story: The older sister gets fed up with her sister and decides to put her kid sister up for sale. So she sets up a lemonade stand crosses off lemonade and write's &#34;Sister for sell - 25cents!&#34;. And her sister looking up to her so much, readily agrees to sit there on the stand as her big sister makes the sales pit.<br /><br /> Characters: Very good characters for a little kids book. I loved the elderly lady.  And I see bits of the older and little sister in me.<br /><br /> Illustrations: Very typical of children's books, but very good. I really like the drawings. :D<br /><br /> Lesson: You don't know what you got until its gone, because once she sales her she really misses her, and well. Just find the book and read it!<br /><br /> Over-all: truly adorable and fun book if you have a sister, or even a little brother(though not exactly the same, you can relate). Its great for little kids, and adults who've had siblings will enjoy it too cause it will bring back those good ol' child hood memories!<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2003-10-23

NO SPOILERS:<br /><br />  As I just finished reading this book for the first time.  I have to say my fill. I suppose some people are disappointed and such, which is bound to happen in a series as popular as Harry Potter is, especially with people putting 'Million Mile High' expectations on something that is only a Muggle's creation.<br /><br />  As much as I love Harry Potter I would not write a good review if I hated it, and despite its length it held my interest from beginning to end, and I read it for 36hrs straight with no breaks, even for sleep or food.<br /><br />  Would I rate it the best in the series? Yes. Why you ask? Skeptical? The characters mainly, I was reduced to tears several times(Though maybe that was from lack-of-sleep! :p)  Yes, the books are flawed, but even JK Rowling said that every time she writes a book she herself believes it is dreadful and 'doesn't know why she's doing this because she's a terrible writer.'  As a fellow writer I do the EXACT SAME THING.  These books aren't dreadful, especially not this, the 5th installment of the series.  It is however, the darkest and most depressing thus far, as it deals with a Harry Potter who is very much torn between his role as a hero, and his role in Cedric Doggory's death.<br /><br />  All the characters have been fleshed out beyond expectations, giving them room to breath and live. I loved Harry and hated him (Quite often at the same time) in this novel. Solely because he reminds a lot of myself. I must be 3yrs behind in maturing as I am going through pretty much exactly what Harry is going through, or have all ready gone through it(With the exception of the death of parents and such.)<br /><br />  This was an important step for Harry to make to become the man he will eventually become.  If you look in the past books there's loads of stuff pointing to all he does.  This book sees him really taking up the role of a leader, and truly beginning to stand against evil on a daily basis and not just once a year over a few week period.  This book is where Harry really begins to grapple with who he really is, and what he should become.  Facing death yet again, and questioning why he even bothers fighting if everyone he loves has to die.<br /><br />  The thing that amazes me in this book particularly, is the detail that J.K. Rowling puts in to these books, and that everything is here for a purpose, not a word is wasted, no matter how mundane some of the material feels at times (especially the scenes with Cho Chang). You can see directly how the events of the books past directly effect the events in OotP and details that were previously unexplained become fleshed out.<br /><br />  It saddens me that 29% of the people on mugglenet.com are disapointed with this book.  I don't think J.K. could've done a better job and nobody else could have written it better(have you ever read HP fan fiction? Who knows the characters better?).  OotP is certainly the most difficult of all the books to read, but it also reveals so many mysteries that it grips on to you tight till the very end.  While one may not be fully satisfied in the way it was written, one can at least be satisfied with its answers, and the way it still leaves many questions to be answered for the last two books.<br /><br />  Yes, I am a Christain too, I love Jesus, but Harry can be used for teaching the gospel too. :D<br /><br />  So I just hope when you read these books, you enjoy them. And if you don't... Well I'm sorry.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amye a year over a few week period.  This book is where Harry really begins to grapple with who he really is, and what he should become.

US	45764909	R68FW8RL67EUS	0440414806	159975375	Holes	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Addicted to Onions.	This has fast become one of my favorite YA books, and one of my favorite books period. Now having read it twice, it still(unlike many stories targeted at younger audiences) holds up incredibly well. Its quite an amazing story,  rather three stories intertwined perfectly together to complement one another and come together in one big climax, it is a strange and bizarre tale with many twist and turns.<br /><br />  This is a  tale about society's underdogs coming out on top. A tale about the importance keeping promises, a tale of destiny, a tale of hope, a tale of cowards, and a tale of courage. Above all it is story about friendship and overcoming yourself to become somebody no one expects, and do things nobody ever expected.<br /><br /> Holes is a very strangely great book, which is a modern fairy tale that stands on it's own. You may expect very little, but you'll most likely come out with a lot.<br /><br />  Side note:  This book inspired me to try to eat a raw onion whole.  I chose a white onion, and that did not go over so well, two bites equaled vomit...  Learned my lesson, has to be a sweet onion such as a vidalia!<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2003-03-08

This book had me laughing the most! Despite what some reviewers have said and criticized about this one, its my favorite of the Georgia series to date simply because I could not stop laughing!<br /><br />Angus really is so hilarious in this one. Not to mention Libby, and even Georgia has gotten funnier. The hilarios scale is pushed way up in this one. Georgia is now considering she may just be an &#34;Easy Fondelree (ie. Someone who is easily fondled)&#34;, and her Snogging withdrawal. As always her conversations with Jas & her stark observations evoke much hilariosity and uncontrollable laughter!<br /><br />  None of other books  had a plot either, I mean it is supposed to be a diary, and in a real diary there is not a plot  A diary is only about the thoughts of the person writing in the diary! This is exactly what Louise has done here, write out Georgia's thoughts as though they are real! I congratulate her for it, she does this in the MOST hilarious ways, I did not think that these books were all to funny up until &#34;Knocked out by my nunga-nugas&#34;, but I did still continue reading them anyways because they were entertaining at least.<br /><br /> If you've read the other books in the series you enjoy enjoy this. Just take a chance,  that it may be hilarious for you.  It is a bit shortand  In my opinion at least as good as the first, maybe even better! I cannot wait for book #4 &#34;Dancing in my Nuddy Pants(Though the title may be changed in the USA I don't know, but it is due to be released in July in the UK of 2002).<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2002-06-23

UPDATED  Monday June 20, 2016 for Grammatical and Structural Errors:<br /><br />REVIEW:<br /><br />This is a great, creative, and empowering tale of fantasy for young girls.  Gail Carson Levine has a wonderful imagination, at first I wasn't sure if I liked the book 30pages in, but then the plot got a jump start and I was hooked, could not stop reading until I was done.<br /><br />I got hooked on Levine's writings after &#34;Ella Enchanted&#34; and I have read ALL of her books (up to 2005), which though all of them may not be up to par with &#34;The Two Princesses of Bamarre&#34; and &#34;Ella Enchated&#34; well-written and fun fantasy tales, and are each enchanting in their own way. I honestly don't know why this author doesn't have the popularity she deserves.<br /><br />Why this tale includes: Two beautifull princesses, one daring and brave and the other shy and a chicken, sorcerer's, fairies, great plot twist, and some magical items that Carson has came up with herself. Everything is described well and comes out like an exquisite painting! It also has great battle scene towards the end! This is a great intro to fantasy for young girls.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2002-04-13

UPDATED Monday June 20, 2016 Grammtically and Structurally:<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />Those of you whom have seen the movie, this is nothing like it, or I should say, the film barely resembles the book at all, and this is not a book for children under the age of 12. I certainly don't like a lot of the stuff in the book being a devout Christian, such as the sex outside marriage stuff and the way some of the characters behave, but despite that I was still able to enjoy this.<br /><br />Now if you've seen the movie, it give you no right to review the book because its almost like two completely different stories..I mean the story line has similarities, but the book is less superficial and more about finding yourself. In  this book nobody likes Mia anymore then before  she get's her hair chopped off and colored with blonde highlights (Yes! It get's chopped off NOT straightened) she's actually treated worse than before. In fact the ONLY reason she's treated any better at all is because the beans get spilled that she is the Princess of Genovia, so its not about her looks, but the new perception of her as nobility. As presented in this story, not everyone in the world wants to be a princess, not everyone can cut it.<br /><br />  Some people would not want the pressure that having to be an international diplomat would bring.  Mia doesn't even wants this and just wants to be herself and find herself, but when she finds out she's not who she thinks she is, it is a tough battle. Also she is made slightly dumb at the beginning, such as  when she finds out her dad is the Prince of Genovia, Meg really could have left that bit out, her response that is.<br /><br />  The Disney flick watered the story down incredibly that's why its like two different stories after reading the book and watching the film. Though I like the wholesomeness in the movie;  I think Meg did a great job with the book even if I do not like all of it's content, as none of my friends are anything like the people in this book, they seem wholly unrealistic, even though the book is still very enjoyable.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amywholly unrealistic, even though the book is still very enjoyable.

UPDATED Mon June 20, 2016 for Grammatical and Structural Issues:<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW WRITTEN IN 2002:<br /><br />This is an entertaining book, once again not for people under the age of 12, because of some of the content, but Meg Cabot has this way of writing in making all these situations hilarious while mixing just the right amount of Fantasy and Reality together and one hilarious story that while fantastical is a reflection of real life as a teenager.<br /><br /> I was unable to put this book down (it was truly a struggle when I did have to take a break from reading it). That is a true rarity in books, this is not like a classic nor will it ever be, but it essentially good pulp romance for teens, something teens should be able to enjoy  for years to come.<br /><br />I suggest you read the first, and then read this. Do not watch the movie then read this book because the premise and story of both book and movie are 100% dissimilar.  Not a book to take seriously, but a great piece of fantasy to take your mind off of the real world for a bit.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy<br /><br />PS: SHE'D BETTER GET WITH MICHAEL SOON!!!	2002-04-07

NOTE:  Revised Structurally and Grammatically on Saturday October 23, 2010.<br /><br />  Give Yourself Goosebumps are a lot of fun, if you can get a hold of any of them, I highly recommend them!  They are wonderful books for children between the ages of 7-12yrs and older if they enjoy this kind of thing.  I still enjoy these books now (10/23/10 and I am 25yrs), these books don't really get old, of course once you've gotten the right ending you have to put it down for a while before you can do it again without automatically know the right way to go, but with 20 different endings there are certainly a lot of different ways the story can go.<br /><br />  A lot of fun, and a little frustrating at times (I still haven't gotten the real ending as of my last read through), but definitely a good book for a rain day.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2001-12-08

I have read all of the original Goosebumps numerous times, and all the &#34;Give Yourself Goosebumps&#34;, as well as all of the Fear Streets&#34; and &#34;Fear Street Sagas&#34;, this one is  in a league of its own, I have recently been re-reading all of them, and it is fun to view them through adult eyes.<br /><br />As with all Goosebumps, things are never quite as they seem, and Hannah's story is one of mystery and intrigue, it is at times, predictable, and at other times, where the story goes is very surprising and it has some suprisingly mature ideas and themes for a Goosebumps book which explores adolescent angst and rebellion and its consequences.<br /><br />The story is engaging, and for a Goosebump book, the characters are surprisingly well-developed.  Although if this book were 200 pages, rather than just over 100, it would have been a little better, but for what it is, a story intended to scare children, it delivers and has some surprisingly touching moments.<br /><br />The character of Hannah isn't the most engaging progatonist, but the supporting character Danny is complex and surprisingly real in his decisions, somewhat abnormal for a Goosebumps where the bizarre is everyday and people at times seemingly make odd and silly choices 99.9% of the time.  Another good Goosebumps which explores more mature themes is &#34;The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight&#34; or even &#34;Attack of the Jack-o-Lanterns&#34;.  I think there is plenty for adults to enjoy here as well as children, if they can appreciate these for what they are; children's books, with at times, very adult themes seen through the eyes of a child.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2001-11-25

In this addition to the Goosebumps series it is about a boy named \\"Todd\\", he tortures his sister continually. He does experiments for a science project and in his fascination with worms, cuts a worm in half. This action proves to be a wrong move as soon after he starts to believe the worms are seeking revenge on him by showing up in his food, bed, and almost everything else.<br /><br />  A highlight of this book is the horrifying bathroom dream. This book just might make you scared of worms, it is a truly gross read at times, but a lot of fun, and is a good fun mystery.  As usual, not much in the way of character development, it is all about the build up of the impending horror, and what unfolds afterwards, it is a fun and light fluffy read.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2001-11-25

So when his sister ask for an egg hunt on her birthday and gets it, Dana isn't surprised, but what does surprise him is the bizarre egg that he finds.<br /><br />  If you love Goosebumps or sci-fi/horror stories for children, there is no reason you shouldn't read this, though it is probably one of lesser entries in the series, it is still very much worth reading.<br /><br />God Bless ~Amy	2001-11-25

It is a chilling tale which contains a better story and better characters than most of the Goosebump books.<br /><br /> Jacelyn is a 12yrs girl from Chicago, she didn't ask her aunt if they could move to Shirpia, an small arctic town, and her aunt didn't ask her if she wanted to move to Shirpia either. Just one day her aunt tells her they are moving and takes her to the icey nowhereville filled with nothing but snow, a church, a few houses, and a small post office; no movies or mall just endless snow...<br /><br />  Jacelyn goes exploring and befriends Rolanda and her brother.  Rolanda fills her in on the strange superstition that revolves around the creepy snowmen that sit in front of each house.  These snowmen are said to protect them...but from what?  Jacelyn always remembered a strange poem about a snowman, but what does that have to do with this town and their strange tradition?<br /><br />  This is one of R.L. Stine's more atmospheric Goosebump books.  He captures the icey land scape very well, and more importantly, creates a very creepy back drop for another \\"chilling\\" tale of mystery and supernatural horror.  If you enjoy creepy stories or R.L. Stine, you will enjoy \\"Beware, the Snowman.\\"<br /><br />  God Bless & *enjoy* ~Amy	2001-11-25
