US	41766091	R1JJGYWIWYBTHQ	0843949783	372932416	Island	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Ok I admit I was entertained	This is supposedly one of Laymons Best novels. If so I don't think I will be reading any more. I have read 4 Laymon Novels, including this one, and it was by far the best of the lot. That said though, its still not that great.<br /><br />I was entertained by the book. It was pretty funny at times, and sort of a guilty pleasure. Actually I would of liked the book more if Laymon had really pushed the envelope even further. There is sex and violence, but I feel like he held back at times.<br /><br />I did enjoy the main character though and the ending was pretty fun. I wouldn't classify this as horror though. Because you are not afraid for the main characters, you actually are excited to see how they will die or be abused by the villian.<br /><br />What I have found from reading Laymon Novels. its about living vicariously through the villians, watching the perverse things they do to the characters in the book. You don't want the heroes to get away and win in the end, You want to see what dirty things Laymon can dream up in his warped fantasies to do to them. It can be entertaining, which I found it was, but you will feel dirty afterward.	2005-09-12

This would make a spectacular movie!<br /><br />So exciting and unpredictable, with well developed characters.<br /><br />Very involving and fast paced.

But this book was a true story that read like a great novel.  What set this book apart from other nonfiction stories is the great character development. The author dove deep to the heart of these men and captured each mans spirit.<br /><br />This book contains exhilerating action, heartbreak, and emotional triumph. This was a great read and I recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I was a fan of  the book the Perfect Storm, but this book was far superior.	2004-07-30
US	41766091	R3KD6MMBSWWAJT	0451210794	363274021	House of Bones	Books	1	7	19	N	N	much ado about boring	I saw a review that implies that this novel reaches the status of literature. If by that they mean this book is dull, slow and overdone maybe. This was a poor book. The author tries to establish character but none of them seem real, despite the effort the characters are very 2 dimensional.<br />The author clearly has some strong views on race, and at first that seemed like it may be interesting in this type of novel, the problem is that he tries to hard to hammer home his view on this topic. Apparently this author feels all white men are insensitive biggots, and the only sympathetic character to the blight of the poor black men and women is a woman.<br />I could of gotten past the politics that I disagree with if the book had at all been interesting or original, which it was not.<br />I was also not a fan of the writing style of this author, it seemed like every once in awhile he would throw in a big word to seem intelligent, but it felt odd and out of place.<br />I recommend not to waste your time, try Michael Connoly's The Poet. That is a very good book.	2004-05-27

This is more of a screenplay than a novel.  The writing is very boring, completely undescriptive.<br />The story is at times amuzing and may make a funny movie, but it is not a good novel. My advice would be wait for the movie.	2004-03-31

The story was fast paced and quite thrilling at times.<br />I would of given this book more stars if it were not for many loose ends that are left at the end.<br />Other than the main character the character development was rather thin. But the biggest problem were all the unanswered QUESTIONS! Clark brings some interesting twists into the story, but he never answers where in the world they came from.<br />If you don't mind loose ends and many unanswered questions. this is a fast paced, fun read that could of been great had Clark given us some answers, it makes you wonder if he couldn't come up with any answers because he didn't know himself.<br />So you do feel a little cheated in the end.	2004-03-26

I read the book in a week, which is fast for me. I thought the characters were very well developed and the story moved along at a quick pace.<br />The atmosphere the author sets up through the novel is great. This is a no holds barred horror novel. I found it an unperdicatble fun read.<br />If you are looking for new authors to try out I would recommend giving this book a try. It is Shannon's first novel and in my opinion shows alot of promise. I have already bought his second book and plan on starting that one soon.<br />I am always trying to find new authors of horror fiction to read. the most recent ones I have tried were Bentley Little and Douglas Clegg. I found Shannon to be a far superiour story teller to these two writers.<br />Check this one out.	2003-10-12

This book introduces one of my favorite all time characters, Anita Blake.<br />This book has its problems, but once it gets rolling it is a quick fun read.  The good news is that the series just gets better from here. The 11th book in the series is now coming out, but start from the beginning. All of the books are worth checking out.	2003-10-01

This book though I thought was much worse. I decided to give this author a shot, and maybe some of his stuff is good, but going by The Store and this book I will never read anything by him again. This book is ridiculous from beginning. The premise is laughable. The characters are annoying.  I wanted Barry and his wife to die in the worst way possible, especially Barry! The lead character could not have been more unlikable.<br />Little comes up with situations that are so over the top and he always has the characters behave in an unbelievable manner. The story has no credibiblity because the story reads like a bad episode of the twilight Zone.<br />I think Little may have some fun books, but the 2 I have read are horrible so I am done with reading Bentley Little.<br />I am waring you, this book is a big waste of time and money	2003-09-29

The character is so much fun to follow along with. This series is just great fun. I read the first in the series and enjoyed the book. But this second entry I felt was much better.<br />Hamilton keeps the twists and surprises coming. and she makes the unbelievable setting, believable.<br />Anita Blake is sexy and tough, and her adventures are pure excitement. I love they way Hamilton writes. This is pure escapist fun. Hamilton transports you to another world, and once you start reading this series you will be hooked. I have already ordered the third in the series. I highly recommend.	2003-09-25

I have read a few of Stephen King's books, and for the most part have not been very impressed. Lot was way beyond any of his books that I have read. This bbok completely pulled me into this world. I felt like I was living in this small town in the late seventies.  The characters felt real, and were well developed. The whole town came alive, and that is what made the story so fun to read. I was skeptical about reading this book because I am not a huge vampire book fan. This doesn't matter with this book, it is just plain scary wether you like them or not. This book has shot to the top of my list of one of my favorite novels of all time. This was more than a mere hooror novel. This book is classic modern literature. Peyton's Place meets Dracula. I loved it. Now I am planning on reading The Shining. Apparently King's older works are far better than his latest novels which have not impressed me.	2003-09-15

My favorite movie is Jaws, and I am into anything based around the ocean and its mystery. If you are like me you will enjoy this book. Benchley is great at building excitement and suspense. The characters are pretty strong and likable. The story flows along quickly. This is a good summer read. Nothing too deep here, but a fun ocean thriller.	2003-09-10
US	41766091	R2RH7JCWVKK0YD	0451192192	260699170	The Store	Books	2	6	8	N	N	HORRIBLE ENDING	I gave this book 2 stars because it had a great opening, and for the most part it kept me interested. Other than that though this is not a good book. As the story goes along it becomes more and more far fetched. It is more laughable than disturbing. The biggest problem though is the author has several bizarre story arcs he goes off on and he never resolves any of them. The ending made me wonder how this got published. I think the author could not figure out how to explain all the bizarre incidents that take place in the book so he just wrapped things up in a simple uninspired ending that left me annoyed.<br />This book is not worth your time. This was my first Bentley Little book, and I must say I am very unimpressed.	2003-08-29

There is nothing amazing or heart pounding here, but if you enjoy light books about Giant sharks you will enjoy the book.	2003-07-24

The story moved along pretty well in the beginning. My first problem with the book was I felt the Characters were week. The title character is very 2 dimensional and the rushed and sudden romance is horrible and is actually what made me stop reading the book. It was like the writer felt he had to throw some romance in and it was stupid and unbelievable, and ruined the book for me. I still give the book 2 stars for the premise and a strong beginning.	2003-07-24

I loved how it started off!  I thought the characters were pretty well established. The book moves along at a great pace and the great shark is frighteneing. I would have given this book a solid 4 stars if it had a better ending. I won't ruin it for anyone but I just found the ending far fetched and a little silly.  If this was a movie and it ended the same way I think people in the theatre would be laughing. Exciting fun book undone by a goofy ending.	2003-07-06

The most important thing is well developed characters. The people in this story felt real, they all had their own distinct personality. That in itself sets it above most horror fiction I have read.  The book provides some great chills and moves along at a fast pace. And unlike most horror fiction has a satisfying conclusion. If you are a Stephen King fan I think you will enjoy this book	2003-06-27

The book moves along at a great pace. Some of the characters are good but for the most part they are very 2 dimensional.  The villian is the most interesting character by far. The story was involving but in the end I felt unsatisfied.  Questions were left unanswered and I felt a little cheated by the end.  I wanted more explanation of what in the worl Tak was.  Where did it come from. what was the deal with the figurines.<br />The book is entertaining and tense in alot of moments.  I would of been much happier if I didn't feel there were so many loose ends.  I have yet to read Regulators maybe that book will shine more light on the subject.	2003-04-04

For the most part it is pretty tough to get interested because there are only 2 characters and you can't really relate with either of them. And for the most part nothing happens, just a whole lot of walking accross the desert. Its not exciting in the least.  But you do get sucked in just because you want to know what is going on and you don't have any idea until you reach the end of the book. I loved the ending so much I have already begun reading the second book.	2002-09-25

Unlike most books this stayts with you and has you thinking about it well after you have put it down.  There could of been better character development in some instances, but the main characters for the most part were well developed. The story is grand in scope, but stayed very personall which I liked. And the Science Fiction stayed light on the science so even those who are not big sci-fi fans can enjoy this book.	2002-09-16
