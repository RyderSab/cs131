The narrator, Saleem Sinai, in some very cleverly-turned phrases, immediately puts us on notice that he was born at the exact moment that India gained its independence from Britain and that as he writes this memoir he expects to die at any time.  That in itself is enough to make you sit up and beg for more; a profoundly significant nativity, coupled with the urgency of impending doom?  What could possibly happen next?<br /><br />Well, I'll tell you what happens next; Saleem Sinai informs us that the powers which devolved upon him due to the time of his birth had no impact whatsoever on anyone, and he confidently expects that his death will be no more notable.  In other words, this is the story of a man who might as well never have lived at all.  God knows what kept me reading after that.<br /><br />Okay, it was Rushdie's undeniable gift of words that kept me reading after that, but the whole book is the same game; Saleem Sinai, in the middle of his narrative, drops a dark hint or two about future events like hidden murder suspects, devastating fire and bomb attacks, wives and sons who aren't truly wives and sons, fascinatingly various magical powers leading to vicious magical wars, and some cruel and dangerous figure called the Widow.  Eventually, all of these oracular utterances come true, you find out what really happened, and because the narrative has built them up to such a pitch the events themselves seem trite and you're left wondering what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />In a way, Rushdie got himself into a real bind here.  If he'd told the story of Saleem Sinai, all the magical ties surrounding his life, his and India's parallel courses, \\"Midnight's Children\\" would have been a much better story, but he would have lost the chance to weave the opulence of his prose and that would have been a serious loss.  On the other hand, by giving his language all this room to stretch and bend into all these mystical hints about what's to come, he robs his plot of its power when the events he's foreshadowed come to pass.  Like the old saying goes, it's always something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my sympathy for Rushdie in his literary difficulties does not extend to excusing his book for its flaws.  If he couldn't find a way to balance the beauty of his language, the weight of his themes and the power of his story, that's his problem, frankly.  It doesn't change the fact that he shot himself in the foot.  (I know, there are a lot of bloodthirsty hooligans and brain-dead sheep out there who'd like to shoot him in a more damaging spot because some group of thin-skinned busybodies told them to, but you know what I mean.)  For all his ambition, admirable as it is, the fact remains that with \\"Midnight's Children\\" Rushdie messed up a perfectly good story by calling too much attention to himself.<br /><br />These \\"slice of life\\" sorts of books - the type that go from miscellaneous Point A to random Point B rather than from beginning to end - have their advantages at times.  They are certainly more prevalent now than in ages past; they're probably easier to write, and authors can throw into these books anything they like without regard for how well those details fit the story, since there is no story as such.  However, as with most modern practices that disregard old traditions, the practitioners of \\"slice of life\\" stories have to be careful; the abandonment of the old rules does not mean that there are no rules, it just means that the new rules have not been discovered yet.  Even players of modern free jazz can make mistakes.  Salman Rushdie has uncovered one of those new rules for us, to wit, if you wish to trade the beginning-middle-end structure for the simple joy of the journey, do not - I repeat, do not - begin by telling us how the journey ends!<br /><br />In short, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is one of those books where you can get more pleasure by turning to a random page and basking in the warmth of the author's narrative skill than you can get by reading the whole thing from beginning to end.  And that, my friends, is why lending libraries are sometimes more useful than bookstores.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, A journey of a thousand miles may begin with a single step, but that single step had better not be the last one.es for us, to wit, if you wish to trade the beginning-middle-end structure for the simple joy of the journey, do not - I repeat, do not - begin by telling us how the journey ends! <br /> <br />In short, \\"Midnight's Children\\" is one of those books where you can get more pleasure by turning to a random page and basking in the warmth of the author's narrative skill than you can get by reading the whole thing from beginning to end.

I pictured myself ascending great heights of wealth and popularity by doing something at once meaningful and unbelievably cool.  I guess many people indulged such fantasies, and like most such people, my fantasies haven't come true - yet.  \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" is about a couple of youngsters who bring their dreams to fruition.  Drat the both of `em.<br /><br />Now, I don't mean to insult anyone or cast doubts on anyone's generosity of spirit, but we all know how most of us would feel if some friend went out and did everything we've ever dreamed of doing; on some level we'd pray to see them fall and break all their metaphorical bones, right?  (If you don't believe me, you're going to have to explain why all those scandalous Hollywood trials draw bigger ratings than the Presidential debates.)  This novel gives us a chance to react in a more charitable manner - Michael Chabon has found a way to narrate the success of Sam Clay and Joe Kavalier while maintaining our sympathy for them, even when they occasionally do incredibly stupid things.<br /><br />The story of this novel is pretty simple.  Sam Clay, the son of Eastern European immigrants and a classic Depression-era hustler, meets his cousin Joe Kavalier, a refugee from Prague with professional training in both painting and Houdiniesque escape, and the two of them go into the comic book business. Their primary character is the Escapist, eventually an anti-Nazi hero, and when they find themselves involved in various ways with an intriguing young woman named Rosa Saks, they produce an adventure series featuring her as a mystical figure named Luna Moth.  Eventually, issues internal and external drive them apart for a while and the comic book disappears.  Do they reconcile?  Do they regain their success?  What about Rosa?  Tune in to our next exciting episode!<br /><br />Books like these often depend for their impact not so much on the story per se, but on the details surrounding the story.  It's a delicate balancing act, because if the author attends too much to the story, you're left wondering what's so special about these characters that they deserve a book of their own.  On the other hand, if there's too much outside detail about the Depression, or life in New York, or World War II, you're left wondering why the author wrote a novel rather than a history book.  Well, this is only Chabon's third novel and his first historical piece that I know of, but he nevertheless gets this balance just right.  It's times like these that I want to get down on my knees and thank God that there are still a few writers out there willing to do their bloody homework.<br /><br />Not that there's anything necessarily wrong with those very brief modern novels with little detail or dialogue and no ending to speak of - the ones that seem to have emerged from the author's dream diary.  I like Paul Auster and Nicholson Baker just fine, and what's more, \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" doesn't have a neat, clean ending any more than \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" does.  However, it's a very satisfying thing in the 21st Century to open a big book and read about fictional characters who encounter Turkish baths full of immigrants, tobacco rationing, miniature radios you order from the back of comic books, Al Smith, the growth of suburbia, and the House Un-American Activities Committee.  I don't mind jumping into some post-modernist's head, but it's nice when an author decides to plant his characters in the world I know, too.  Or at least the world that gave rise to the world I know.<br /><br />That's especially true when said characters seem like people I might actually meet.  Sam and Joe, and Rosa too, have to manage businesses, deal with relationships and children, and try real hard to be decent to one another when they all have good reason to spend their lives crying their eyes out about the bad breaks they've had.  If I knew them in real life, I'd be happy to take care of them; I'd think they were well worth my time, and  I'd know that they'd also be happy to take care of me.  I like these people, by golly.<br /><br />Notice I haven't said much about the comic book characters.  This is because they don't really enter into the novel very much, despite the jacket blurb implying that this is in truth the story of Joe and Sam the comic artists.  It's more like the story of Joe and Sam the men, and how they sometimes translate the problems of daily life into comic-book adventures to make them more palatable.  (The title of the novel makes this clear enough, I'd say - we'd all find daily life more endurable if we could think of it as an amazing adventure.)  The comic stories described in the novel are quite good; they seem very authentic for the time and are accompanied by scholarly footnotes to make them seem more real.  Indeed, this novel has actually inspired a real Escapist comic book (sixty-odd years late, but never mind).  \\"Kavalier & Clay,\\" however, is not a comic book - it's an excellent novel about two men who sometimes wish they lived in a comic book, but eventually realize that the real world is more than good enough to sustain them, especially if they help each other at the right time.

Asked to describe the play, he says, \\"It's about a gravedigger who meets a prince.\\"<br /><br />Parts of \\"The Intuitionist\\" might strike you as being similarly self-absorbed, except that the whole world of the novel takes that attitude, not just one person.  While it may be normal to write a novel about an elevator inspector in an environment where people have other jobs and interests, it is quite unusual to write a novel about an elevator inspector who meets no one but other elevator professionals.  This is an obsessed protagonist in an obsessed world.<br /><br />Her name is Lila Mae Watson, the first black woman to earn an elevator inspector's badge, and the daughter of an elevator operator in a department store.  She graduated from the elevator inspector's academy, evidently an enormous compound of impressive buildings.  Her love interest works as a waiter for a professional association of inspectors.  All of this association's members are, like Lila Mae, intuitionists; when inspecting an elevator, they intuit any problems in a sort of meditative trance rather than by examining the elevator's workings, as the Empiricists do.  And Lila Mae's love interest has a connection to Intuitionism's philosophical founder, as well.  She meets one reporter in her travels - he works for \\"Lift\\" Magazine, available at every newsstand.  She meets a number of underworld figures - they obtain most of their money from corruption among elevator maintenance men.<br /><br />The story opens with Lila Mae Watson learning that a brand-new elevator, inspected and passed by her, has crashed just when the Mayor was dedicating the building.  She believes that this is a coincidence even less than you do, and goes about to discover what actually happened.  She's in trouble, even perhaps to the extent of a threat to her life, and she realizes this.  Nevertheless, she neither panics nor complains, but remains cool and effective throughout.  In other words, she behaves in a manner that leaves the Empiricists no chance to get at her, which drives them and the Intuitionists right up the wall.<br /><br />Are you starting to get the idea?  The inhabitants of the city described here are surrounded by elevators the way you and I are surrounded by sex - and yes, there is a certain amount of eroticism involved in the relationship.  (I'll leave the dirty jokes to your imagination.)  Mostly, though, this is a noir murder mystery, complete with crime, cover-up, hardboiled investigator, implications that go all the way to the highest levels of government, and shameful secrets from the past.  The only difference is that this time the victim is - you guessed it - an elevator.<br /><br />Maybe the most remarkable thing about \\"The Intuitionist\\" is that Colson Whitehead invented this lift-happy world, and endowed it with a plausible story, without getting satirical or cute.  You know the kind of thing I'm talking about, where the author turns every other word into a pun based on the central idea so everyone will know how clever he is?  Or decides that because the book is an allegory it doesn't have to have an actual story to it?  Not here.  This is a genuine, effective thriller with some rather inspired fantasy elements thrown in.<br /><br />All of this works just right from start to finish.  One element that works less well is the novel's theme of racism.  On the one hand, Lila Mae Watson's color - the necessity of contending with bigotry and condescension - adds to her growing isolation as the story progresses.  On the other hand, it yanks the story out of Whitehead's carefully-constructed fantasy world and into real history.  The racism that Lila Mae must face in \\"The Intuitionist\\" is blatant, overt and straight out of the Jim Crow age.  It is therefore anachronistic; today's real-world racism is a much subtler and slimier animal.  I, for one, found the whole subtext distracting; I can't possibly object to an author's decision to deal with real social evils in a fantasy, but I do object if an author decides to deal with former social evils in a fantasy.  If the Harry Potter books tried to deal with the nineteenth-century issue of child labor rather than the twenty-first-century issue of child abuse, I would ask the same question: \\"What's the point?\\"<br /><br />Well, \\"The Intuitionist\\" is a first novel, and evidently Colson Whitehead wanted to deal with racism, so he shoehorned it into his book when it doesn't really belong there.  It's not fatal, but it is a pity, because actually the issue of racial differences does add something to his plot.  Without giving too much away, it turns out that racial tension and elevator theory do share one characteristic; the desire to escape.<br /><br />And here we come to the thing that elevates \\"The Intuitionist\\" above simple entertainment and makes it a genuine achievement.  If it were just a murder mystery with an elevator as the victim, the book would be a curiosity, nothing more.  Turns out, though, because of that theme of the desire to escape, that this is really a study of the struggle between living by rules and living by improvisation.  Lila Mae Watson's entire character, as it exists at the story's beginning, hews so very closely to a rule system that she's barely human.  Through her encounters with people and things that long for escape, for the opportunity to invent their own existences, Lila Mae comes awake.  At the end of the book, she has no strict guidance anymore, but she is content.<br /><br />That's why \\"The Intuitionist\\" is a good use of your reading time.  It goes down smoothly, but like most good pulp literature it can make an important difference in your life without being too obvious about it.  Now, if I said that this sounds like an average ride in an elevator, would you say I was getting obsessed?<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Life is a balance between obedience and inventionn author's decision to deal with real social evils in a fantasy, but I do object if an author decides to deal with former social evils in a fantasy.

US	52837146	R2ZJMLRXO25RD	0802135277	133846795	The Public Burning (Coover, Robert)	Books	3	17	23	N	N	No more than a sideshow attraction	Every now and then I finish a book and ask, \\"Now why did this author write that?\\"  I'm not talking about trash reading.  We know what that's for; entertainment.  No, when I ask \\"Why?\\" after finishing a book, it's generally a longer work with artistic ambitions and evidently an important point to make.  I just can't tell what that point might be.<br /><br />Take \\"The Public Burning\\".  The author, Robert Coover, is widely considered to be one of the leading lights of American experimental fiction.  The novel is a semi-fictionalized narrative of the days preceding the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, here as in real life convicted of treason for selling atomic secrets to the Russians.  It's a good read, but what's the value in telling a true story in such an odd way?  The true story is dramatic enough as is.  Coover never quite answers that, and it weakens his book.<br /><br />Feel free to skip this part if you know the historical facts:<br /><br />Back in the 1950s, the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear bomb.  Many assumed that the Soviets must have stolen nuclear information from the U.S. through a network of spies, and the FBI picked the Rosenbergs as the guilty parties.  They were convicted and sentenced to death, and despite a last-minute stay of execution by Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, they went to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.<br /><br />In his novel, Coover recasts the Rosenberg execution as a piece of political theater, deliberately staged by the Eisenhower administration to boost American morale, and therefore set to take place as the novel opens not at the Sing Sing death house, but in the middle of Times Square.  Uncle Sam, here a real person, is a sort of superhero, possessed of remarkable powers in his neverending battle against the Phantom, his appropriately shady Communist counterpart.  And perhaps most bizarrely, while half the chapters have the usual third-person narrator telling the story in a kind of hyper-inflated circus language, the other chapters are narrated by none other than Vice President Richard Nixon.<br /><br />Before we get to Tricky Dick, however, let's consider the carnival-barker narration of the other chapters.  It's filled with comic-book jargon, interjections on the order of \\"Good Heavens!\\" and various other cheesy rhetorical devices.  Uncle Sam himself speaks like a snake-oil salesman, tossing in many a \\"Whoopee-ti-yi-yo!\\" and things like that as the execution approaches.<br /><br />Evidently, this book seeks to present the United States as a nation of con men and suckers, but in the midst of all the tinsel and ballyhoo (directed by Cecil B. DeMille, with sets by Walt Disney), it seems like a lot of fun.  Coover shows a nice balance between the exhilaration of rah-rah Americanism and the horror of the rot under the surface.  It's all part of the same long, strange trip, and you can't have one without the other.<br /><br />With a similar schizophrenia, in his sections of this book, Nixon has a sort of poetry in his soul and genuine sense of mission, both of them about as banal as you please.  That sounds like a contradiction in terms, I know, but what else can you say about a character who comes right out and says that he loves his wife primarily because she belongs to him?  Who can't decide between serving his country and serving himself, and often conflates the two?  And who spends half his time parsing every one of Uncle Sam's most moronic clich&eacute;s like it was the entrails of some sacrificial chicken?<br /><br />If this description reminds you of your favorite national politican, Republican or Democrat, I assure you that's not a coincidence.  Nixon himself once said, in real life, that John Kennedy was what people wanted to be, and he himself what they actually were.  In any case, his fictionalized counterpart here is doubtless what we're afraid we are.  He is Vice President of the United States, for God's sake, and he's still a loser.  He sweats and stinksthrough the pages in desperate need of a shave or a toilet, he strains to justify himself and his past in the middle of a national crisis, he can't even relax while playing golf.  And needless to say, the more he struggles for victory, the more clownish he becomes.  By the time the book is over, a jammed Times Square has had an eyeful of Dick Nixon with his pants around his ankles, and there are worse humiliations in store for him.<br /><br />Okay, so far we've got an examination of the American split personality from two very different and complementary points of view, filtered through an actual historical event and featuring historical figures.  I was intrigued.  So why did I feel so let down when I reached the last page?<br /><br />I think it's because, when you get right down to cases, nothing really happens in \\"The Public Burning\\".  Ethel and Julius Rosenberg die, Uncle Sam taps Nixon as a future president, and things go back to the way they were before.  For all the flash and dazzle, the comic book zip, the world of this book and the world we live in are pretty much alike.  Which isn't a bad thing, but the flourish made me anticipate something more, some explosive scream at the end.  Instead, \\"The Public Burning\\" reads like Coover simply observed these events through a literary kaleidoscope and wrote down what he saw.  That makes for good painting sometimes, but not necessarily good novels; \\"The Public Burning\\" is an amusing experiment, but so what?<br /><br />In short, this book would have made a truly fascinating short piece, and even as is it's a lot of fun to read for the language alone.  Really good full-length novels, on the other hand, leave what Anthony Burgess called some kind of residue in the mind.  \\"The Public Burning\\" just slides right through.

US	52837146	R17DHPT6Y48EZ4	0375725024	427984483	Cakes and Ale	Books	5	113	127	N	N	Literary Love	Reading Somerset Maugham can be a little disorienting at times.  I don't know about you, but when I read a first-person novel like \\"Cakes and Ale\\" I generally expect that first-person narrator to be the main character.  Not this time; as usual with Maugham, the narrator is the storyteller, not the subject, and it is this seemingly unnecessary complication that leads to questions.  Why not just write the usual third-person story?<br /><br />Well, I haven't read much of Maugham's work, but what I have read concerns people whose actions and motives are mysterious to others.  You can't very well preserve the aura of mystery around a character if the author knows everything the character thinks and does, can you?  (Well, you can - see \\"Anna Karenina,\\" for instance - but it's a difficult trick at best.)  Much easier to give yourself a first-person narrator who can try very hard to understand your hero and fail, thus preserving the intrigue.  That's what young Ashenden does here for the fascinating Rosie Driffield.<br /><br />Everybody who knows Rosie loves her, in one way or another; some from afar, some (including Ashenden, Maugham's alter ego) from a good deal closer.  Those who don't know her, on the other hand, hold her in contempt.  Which wouldn't be all that important except that her husband, Edward Driffield, shortly emerges as one of the most important of the late-Victorian novelists.  At that point, Rosie, a former barmaid, becomes a serious blot on Edward's reputation by her birth and background alone - bad enough when she's sleeping with every slightly interesting man who comes her way, worse after other developments ensue.<br /><br />Ashenden tells us all this from a remove of several decades, long after Rose and Edward have both departed from the scene.  He is a successful author and literary icon, narrating his memories of the Driffields at the request of his friend Alroy Kinear, another successful author who has received the commission to write Driffield's biography from the great man's second wife, now his widow.<br /><br />Got all that?  It sounds complicated, but it actually reads very clearly.  Maugham had a genuine gift for direct, simple prose, and it operates brilliantly here.<br /><br />He also had a gift for nasty caricature, and \\"Cakes and Ale\\" got him in a lot of trouble for the characters of Driffield (based on Thomas Hardy) and Kinear (based on Hugh Walpole).  Why the trouble?  It's hard to know at this late date, but Driffield as a character begins as an irresponsible lower-class cuckold and ends as a whipped dog, completely under the thumb of his self-appointed literary guardians.  Kinear is a no-talent social climber, more than happy to give the dead Driffield the biographical whitewash his widow seems to want.  Considering that these characters were obviously based on the universally praised Hardy and the very popular Walpole, the public outcry against \\"Cakes and Ale\\" is not surprising.<br /><br />It is, however, ironic.  Here's a piece of work aimed directly at the disgusting tendency of the establishment to turn warm, flesh-and-blood authors into literary marble and to forcefully disregard any embarrassing truths, and in response to this cry for honesty, the public insisted upon maintaining that marble façade.<br /><br />Now that the controversy has long died down, though, we can enjoy the work for what it is, a brilliantly structured exploration of how one simple woman outwits all the forces lined up to push her aside as an affront to good taste.<br /><br />Actually, it's not so much that she outwits anyone; rather, she does as she pleases and accepts any consequence with utter calm.  That is, at a time and in a place where everyone, including her husband, pretends to be something they are not, she is always and unfailingly herself.  She even says to Ashenden, \\"You must take me as I am.\\"  Surely it's a result of this attitude that those who know her love her - it's a very attractive characteristicin an oppressive society - and those who don't, don't.<br /><br />A lesser writer might have given us a Rosie with a halo because of her self-knowledge; Maugham is not such a fool.  Rosie's behavior hurts a lot of people, and what's worse, she doesn't seem to notice it.  Even more interestingly, Maugham takes pains to show the impact on Rosie herself of her insistence on complete freedom.

US	52837146	R1DLPXT4PAXJZG	0684804433	296077082	Look Homeward, Angel	Books	4	30	38	N	N	The world's most annoying genius	Calling Thomas Wolfe a literary genius is like calling your wife a dynamite telephone caller; it may be true, but it doesn't tell you much.<br /><br />After all, when we think of literary genius, we tend to think of a gift of words exercised in the service of something big, like truth or beauty or human potential, don't we?  We may disagree about whether some genius accomplished great work, but it seems as though geniuses at least try to tackle something larger than themselves.<br /><br />Well, if Thomas Wolfe was a genius (and I'm not _entirely_ convinced), he seems to have used his abilities mostly to let everyone know just what a special, unique, amazing, unappreciated and put-upon soul Thomas Wolfe was.  Some may call that an accomplishment; I call it whining.<br /><br />Mind you, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" is a very accomplished whine.  In all honesty, too, that's not all it is.  This book was one of the earliest examples of American realism as it came to prominence between the World Wars, a movement that included Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and all those other guys trying to shake loose from the Victorian romantic tradition.  This means that Wolfe devoted considerable effort to descriptions of Southern small-town life around the turn of the century in all its details, including the ones that respectable people preferred not to think about.  As such, it's a convincing job.<br /><br />Structurally, this is pretty straight narrative, which means that whatever was innovative about it had to come through Wolfe's writing style.  \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" concerns the history of Eugene Gant, Wolfe's alter ego, from a few years before his birth in North Carolina to his departure for graduate school at Harvard University.<br /><br />He grows, learns to deal with an alcoholic force of nature for a father, a semi-delusional miser for a mother, and a bunch of half-crazed older siblings.  He explores the town from its wealthiest mansions to it most degraded poverty and racism.  He goes to school and shows early promise, reads incessantly and fancies himself the hero of the grand drama that is his life.  He falls in love two or three times, sometimes platonically and sometimes not.  He attends college, finding it difficult at first, but soon makes a place of prominence for himself there.  Finally, upon coming home, losing a favorite brother to tuberculosis and discovering the joys of alcohol, he confronts his family's collective sickness and littleness of mind, and heads north.<br /><br />None of this is terribly unusual.  Indeed, any young person with any soul at all has probably gone through similar phases and stages, including the conviction that no one has ever gone through anything remotely like this before (ah, I remember the attitude well).  That's what makes \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" such an unbelievable pain in the rear; Wolfe apparently never grew up enough to realize that his experiences are universal, and so throughout his book he insisted on couching Eugene's (or his own) smallest experiences in the imagery of glorious Homeric adventure, with language to match.<br /><br />Sometimes this actually works.  When, for instance, Wolfe describes the opening of a day in the Gant household with its boisterous flow of energy and alarming quantities of breakfast, the inflated language sucks you right in, makes you want to grab a plum from the Gants' table and chow down.  The town, the people and the life are so vivid that it's no wonder people believed in them.  Some found the sensuality so overwhelming they seemed to regard Wolfe as a threat to public morals.<br /><br />Elsewhere, though, particularly when showing us Eugene's inner life, the whole edifice falls apart like used Kleenex.  Which may be appropriate considering the tears Wolfe obviously expects us to shed for Eugene, but it's hardly pleasant or inspiring.  Surely it was possible, for instance, to give us Eugene's melodramatic love for a boarder in his mother's hotel without making himseem quite so pathetic?  This is a boy and a slightly older girl in a run-down boardinghouse in North Carolina, after all, not Lancelot and Guinevere in noble but doomed love at Camelot, but you'd never know that from the language Wolfe uses.<br /><br />There was something I found disrespectful in Wolfe's utter inability to judge what tone to take with regular people and their lives.  Such things are without question worthy of attention and respect; that's the whole idea of America.  Wolfe's writing at these moments made me wonder if he was really attending to his characters and their experiences, or whether he was just using the whole thing to show off how fancy his writing could be.  Made me want to reach into the book and slap him.  Twice.<br /><br />So why the four stars?  Well, because the man could actually write, dammit.  He could write so well that even his purplest passages fascinated me.  And at the end, as callow as Eugene Gant remains and as unaware of how ridiculous his moans of ecstasy and woe can be, I couldn't help liking the jerk.  If I came across someone like him in real life, I'd think he was going to be a very worthwhile man one day, after a good kick in the pants or two.<br /><br />Thomas Wolfe didn't live long enough to benefit from such a kick in the pants, but his books show what he might have made of himself, so the air of melancholy about his prose feels earned somehow.  And he certainly helped deliver a very useful kick to American literature, booting it right out of its leftover 19th-century politeness.  For that alone, \\"Look Homeward, Angel\\" deserves our gratitude.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, God save me from a genius who knows he's a genius.thout making him seem quite so pathetic?

US	52837146	R2RJU13F357Y12	1931561648	798265328	The Time Traveler's Wife	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Yes, there is such a thing as adult science fiction	Science fiction today is not necessarily found in the science fiction section of the local bookstore, a very sensible state of affairs indeed.  After all, this is not 1955; the future is not fifty or a hundred years away anymore, it's next week.  At that time, we will be dealing with the same problems, and calling upon the same inner resources, that we have now, which was always the case, but it's more obvious these days.  The only difference will be in the tools we have at hand.  Our souls will be the same, and so will our stories.  The Time Traveler's Wife is a good case in point.<br />Audrey Niffenegger's debut novel is about a woman married to a man with a dangerous task to perform that takes him away from home for indefinite periods to places she cannot go; he himself points out that it's not unlike being married to a policeman.  As the title indicates, however, Clare DeTamble's husband Henry travels in both time and space, for no particular reason.<br />In truth, this is not a science fiction story, or at least not a recognizable one.  A doctor arrives at a genetic explanation for Henry's malady, but apart from that the story contains little advanced technology of any kind.  Nevertheless, as it is set (partly) in a viable future and contains a new development in human evolution, we will quietly claim it for sf, because it is a beautiful piece of work and deserves the honor of the title.  (We are a little biased, as you can plainly see.)<br />It is a first novel, and suffers from some first-novel flaws.  Although narrated by Clare and Henry in turn, it has a lot of trouble providing distinct voices for the two of them; husband and wife are poetic and sensitive, philosophical and very much in love, so that apart from the fact that one travels and the other does not, they are linguistically indistinguishable.  More seriously, Ms. Niffenegger seems to have a problem with violence.  Not that she's incapable of writing about it; she's a little squeamish, is all.<br />Henry DeTamble's violent ways make perfect sense; at a moment's notice he may find himself in dangerous territory without money or clothes, and therefore develops mastery in mugging, breaking and entering, picking pockets and other crimes, some of which we see him practice to assure his survival.  He also has a nasty habit, before encountering Clare, of drinking too much and womanizing.  Believable, is it not?  On the other hand, he reads great books and works with special collections at a Chicago library.  He is intimately familiar with museums of various kinds and cooks wonderful meals at the drop of a hat.  His is a complex personality.  Fine.  So why does Ms. Niffenegger insist on describing his drunken outrages and bone-breaking episodes in her loveliest, most poetic terms?<br />In short, like many first-time authors, this one tends to serve her own needs before her story's, and I don't care because the book works.  It's lovely, and it carries the reader along for the ride so smoothly that you don't quite notice how much you hop around the years.  Not only does Ms. Niffenegger get you deeply inside this dedicated, loyal and loving marriage and get your praying for its success despite formidable pain, she also manages the neat trick of mapping out a complex plot while describing its events seriously out of order.  The narrative at various times jumps backwards, or more rarely forwards, by up to twenty years or so, yet we are never confused as to when we are or what's going on.  And she's not so devoid of mischief as to fail to take advantage of the opportunity to foreshadow important events through one character's eyes and withhold the payoff for hundreds of pages.<br /> Thankfully, the plot points and tricks (delicious through they are) do not overwhelm this novel.  Henry and Clare, their various family members and friends are also real people with real lives, real jobs and interests, real sins.  A good story often includes real-world knowledge apart from itsbasic scheme of events, and this one teaches us something about library operations, papermaking, cooking, genetics and music without interrupting that all-important flow.<br /> So here's a long but fast-reading book about a successful marriage between two real people with real problems and real disagreements.  It's even got certain markings of a classic tragedy and a closing that's enough to melt the heart of a snowman.  I'm not sure the title is quite accurate, since the story is as much about Henry as it is about Clare and more about them both than either one separately.  Quibbles aside, though, and despite the flaws, this is about as impressive a debut effort as we've seen for many a long year, however counted.<br /> And you thought science fiction was kid stuff.  Hah.<br /> Benshlomo says, Believe it or not, you're living in a science fiction story.ts basic scheme of events, and this one teaches us something about library operations, papermaking, cooking, genetics and music without interrupting that all-important flow.<br /> So here's a long but fast-reading book about a successful marriage between two real people with real problems and real disagreements.

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, a satire is a \\"literary work holding up human vices and follies to ridicule or scorn\\".  Of course, you may not believe that Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, George W. Bush and Dick Cheney participate in human vices and follies, but leaving that aside, Al Franken is a satirist.  Now we can all relax.<br />Anyone can write a piece full of scorn and ridicule, needless to say.  To be worthwhile, though, it has to include other things.  Like, for instance, relevant facts, accurate analysis, a coherent point of view, even wit.  Let's not get into who's got the monopoly on those elements in the current firefight between the left and right; Franken's got them all to at least some degree, which should be enough for anyone willing to plonk down twenty-five bucks (or fourteen and change on Amazon).  What, though, if anything, makes this a genuinely good book?<br />The answer to that, unsurprisingly, has a lot to do with Al Franken himself.  On the evidence of \\"Lies\\", he's very smart, very angry, and very good at his job, but he's not so arrogant that he thinks he can face down the right on his own.  So, before writing this book, he went and got himself a group of graduate students to do research for him.  His first clever move was naming this bunch \\"Team Franken\\", like it was a professional staff at some cable network with too much money in its digital effects budget.  His second clever move was pointing out that all Team Franken had to do to disprove many right-wing claims was run a few Google searches.<br />With that kind of start, I was all set for Lies to turn into the story of Al and Team Franken running around looking for some challenge, some really subtle and dangerous right-wing lie that would require all of their might to debunk, and not finding it because all the right-wing claims are so blatantly false.  That would have been a terrific book.  This, however, is not that book, and again the reason for it has to do with Franken himself.  Very smart, very angry, very good at his job, he attacks everything about the right that he can't stand, applying dozens of styles and strategies, and winds up with a good collection of essays instead of a great cohesive work.<br />In \\"Lies\\", Al Franken has two main targets  the right-wing \\"news\\" of Matt Drudge, Fox News and others, and the George W. Bush administration  and that right there divides his book in a way he can't quite spackle over.  Then too, he has enough ability to pull him in several directions, such as straight reportage, prose satire, legitimate and political theater, and even comics, which further blurs his focus.  The individual chapters of \\"Lies\\" entertain and instruct quite well, sometimes brilliantly, but the whole thing never gels into anything more than the sum of its considerable parts.<br />This is a pity, because Franken actually has an important point to make.  He's savvy enough to spell it out:  \\"Part of [the right-wing media's] entertainment value comes from their willingness to lie and distortOur added entertainment value will have to come from being funny and attractive.  And passionate.  And idealistic.  But also smart.\\"  That, it seems clear, is the central thrust of his whole effort.  Unfortunately, the statement is on page 353, after a tasty but amorphous goulash of ideas about everything from Bill O'Reilly's emotional fragility to Sean Hannity's statistical fudging to Ann Coulter's rhetorical tricks.  And then to the story of what might have happened if the right-wing hawks Bush, Cheney, Thomas, Limbaugh, Will and others had served in Vietnam, and then something called Supply Side Jesus, who wears a gold-trimmed robe and a pedicure<br />There's certainly nothing wrong with a good collection of satirical political essays, but \\"Lies\\" could have been a great deal more than that.  Basedon that statement about entertainment value, I suspect Franken intended his book to be the opening shot in a left-wing counterattack against the right's demonizations over the past few years.  In fact, it almost is that shot.  He may very well get it just right next time, especially with all the free publicity he's been receiving lately.<br />I note, by the way, that Fox News has recently announced that its withdrawal of the copyright-infringement lawsuit against Franken will allow him to sink back into the obscurity from whence he came.  Now, let's see; Fox News brought suit against Al Franken because he wasn't supposed to use the phrase \\"fair and balanced\\" in the title of this book, they splashed it all over every newspaper, political website and blog in the country, they got slapped down hard, and now they're talking like the whole thing was a publicity coup by Al Franken.  He should have a field day with that one.<br />Benshlomo says, Laugh at your enemies; it will drive them crazy.on that statement about entertainment value, I suspect Franken intended his book to be the opening shot in a left-wing counterattack against the right's demonizations over the past few years.

US	52837146	R2ZD95GOZBFVXN	0895262029	462747903	The New Americans: How the Melting Pot Can Work Again	Books	2	13	29	N	Y	This Is Not 1925	The idea behind this book is an interesting one.  Mr. Barone suggests that, although some fear the recent influx of immigrants to the United States, there's really nothing to worry about if we learn the lessons of history.  Three of the largest immigrant populations from the early part of the 20th century, he points out, have \\"woven themselves\\" into mainstream American life with great success.  Now, three large \\"new\\" populations can do the same, based on their similarities to those who came before.  The black population (\\"immigrant\\" in the sense that it moved from the rural South, practically a foreign country, to the industrial North) can weave itself into mainstream American life as the Irish did, the Latino population as the Italians did, and the Asian population as the Jews did.  Sounds pretty good, and Barone has plenty of statistical and historical evidence to support himself.  Then he goes and ruins it with a political bias he claims he doesn't have.<br />I can easily believe that the groups he mentions have as much in common as he says.  Long before he wrote this book, we Jews knew perfectly well that the Asians were very much like us, and I'm told the Asians knew it too, so the notion that the blacks and Irish, or the Latinos and Italians, share the same parallels seems quite natural.  Mr. Barone makes good use of statistics to point up these parallels, showing that intermarriage rates climb over the generations, school dropout rates tend to fall, and a number of other factors similarly indicate that immigrant groups gradually join the American melting pot.  On the other hand, he points up the vast contributions that immigrants make to American culture and progress, even when they are subject to bigotry and inconvenience; I was not aware, for instance, that a lot of what we now consider to be old-style American ways are actually Irish.<br />The point of all this, according to Mr. Barone, is that American policy of the early 1900's gave immigrant groups the incentive and means to work their way up the social ladder by teaching English to those who did not know it, forcing immigrant groups to follow the law when their native folkways did not require it, and things of that nature.  If we believe that assertion, it follows (says Mr. Barone) that the current emphasis on respect for native culture only keeps immigrant groups separate.  So away with bilingual education and affirmative action, and the sooner the better.<br />Sounds familiar, this argument.  It's classic Republican conservative doctrine.  Which doesn't mean it's wrong, of course.  In a book like this, though, I'd prefer an author who didn't simply assume it was right.<br />That is, \\"The New Americans\\" begins with the assumption that bilingual education, affirmative action, and overcautiousness regarding racism are ineffective, without bothering to provide any evidence that that assumption is true.  The book also begins with the assumption that what worked in the 1920's will automatically work in this decade, similarly without providing any evidence.  We've come a long way in that 80 years, conquering a good portion of the racism that plagued this country and realizing that our government doesn't always know what's best, but Mr. Barone seems to want to import the old doctrine of \\"Americanization\\" without any further inquiry.  A little naive, if nothing else.<br />What's more, Mr. Barone has an unpleasant habit of attributing the worst of motives to those he disagrees with.  In his discussion of the Latino immigration numbers, for instance, he notes the huge upsurge in Latino citizenship in about 1995 due to President Clinton's amnesty for illegal aliens, and dutifully reports that Clinton implemented the amnesty so that all those new Latino citizens could vote for him in the next election.  It doesn't seem to occur to him that Clinton might have been motivated by an impulse to do the right thing, or even by a combination of motives.<br />Most annoying to me personally, I might as well admit, is his explanation of Jewish voting habits.  Jews are frequently business owners and professionals, and if they voted strictly according to their own self-interest might be expected to support tax cuts and libertarian policies.  Why do they remain overwhelmingly liberal?  Not because their consciences call them to do so, says Mr. Barone.  It's because they remember down the generations the injustices of Imperial Russia, whence many of their ancestors came, and vote Democratic because they are \\"still voting against the Tsar.\\"  See the implication?  No one in his right mind would be a liberal; those Jews retain \\"dysfunctional habits of mind\\" or they'd go Republican.  Bunch of neurotics.<br />And this is not Mr. Barone's attitude just toward the Jews.  Everyone comes in for that sort of analysis.  He uses his own political opinions as a sort of litmus test, and demonizes those who fail.  Conservatives have pure motives, liberals impure, and never the twain shall meet.  At least not if Michael Barone has anything to say about it.<br />Finally, for all his declarations of historical perspective, Mr. Barone doesn't bother to make any suggestions as to exactly how the black, Latino and Asian populations might be mainstreamed, based on the lessons learned from history or on anything else.  His introduction seems to promise some fresh, or at any rate good, ideas about immigrant policy, but when it's all said and done he's content to grind up his anecdotes and statistics into conservative hamburger and let it go at that.  He pretends to provide a work of popular political advocacy that turns out to be nothing more than a Republican political pamphlet.  He even starts off his discussion with a jab at Al Gore.  And if you think that's a coincidence, you haven't been reading the news from Washington lately.<br />\\"The New Americans\\" is an interesting read with a number of intriguing notions about culture and politics.  In its certainty that America can absorb and provide for everyone who makes a home here, it's reassuring, even heartwarming.  Maybe someday some political leader will take these ideas and design a new \\"Americanization\\" program that works in a just and fair manner for all.

Impressive.  The story itself is not quite that awe-inspiring, but that's good news; if Harry's latest adventure were that brilliant, I can practically guarantee that people wouldn't love it as much as they do.<br />We begin where Harry's adventures always begin; he's safe and miserable at the home of his disgusting relations, longing for the Hogwarts School and anxious for news from his friends.  Well, he eventually gets both - no prizes for guessing that bit.  This time, significantly, getting back to school and to his friends provides no relief, for several reasons.  First, much of the wizarding world thinks he's either crazy or lying about his previous experiences.  Second, his adult allies give him little or no information about how much danger he is in, from where, or what they are doing about it.  And third, although it is not spelled out, he gets no relief because he's turning into a teenager.<br />(He's been a technical teenager for a couple of years now, of course, but now he really starts to act like one.  Never mind bloodthirsty enemies, horrible relatives and a cowardly Ministry of Magic - becoming a teenager is serious.)<br />You've heard all the rumors about what happens next, of course.  Suffice to say that Harry and his growing corps of buddies spend the next several hundred pages fighting the evil wizard Voldemort, the reactionary elements in the Ministry of Magic, the snobs and thugs in Slytherin House at school, and the usual gang of idiots.  Nothing new there.  So do you really need to worry that someone will tell you how it all turns out?  No, you don't - you already know how it all turns out, that's why you're reading the book in the first place.<br />Well, that and a few other things, but let's be honest; anyone who reads any popular fantasy series, including Harry Potter, and expects daringly original plotting is a fool.  Ms. Rowling is neither a brilliant prose stylist nor a devastatingly original thinker.  What she is, more so with each volume in her series, is a teller of rattling good yarns that carry a deep but deftly handled understanding of a young person's psychology.<br />Why, for instance, is \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\" so dark in tone?  Because the life of a fifteen-year-old, wizard or not, can be a dark place at times.  Let me ask you this: If you, like Harry, were a teenage boy forced to spend weeks and weeks with people you loathed, after suffering dreadful losses at the hand of someone who hated your every cell and was still out and about, and after you had unequivocally shown several times how brave and skillful you were - how would you react if every adult in your life said \\"Just sit tight, dear, you wouldn't understand anyway, you let us handle it\\"?  You'd be an angel of light, would you?<br />I don't think so, buddy.  On the other hand, if you, like Harry, have a normal level of decency, you would not throw temper tantrums every five minutes, either.  You would behave as Harry does here - you would struggle against bitterness and frustration, you would try to be kind to your friends, and once in a while you would lose it and nail everyone in sight right between the eyes.<br />All of this is right on target, as anyone knows who has raised an adolescent boy, had dealings with an adolescent boy, or been an adolescent boy.  What's more, Harry in this book must contend not only with a highly pressurized attempt to grow up, but also with the true unpolished memory of his father, the mysterious minds of girls, and his role as a leader - to say nothing of the ongoing threats to his life and sanity.  All of those, except the last (I wish), fall to the lot of every maturing teen.  People wonder why Ms. Rowling's books get thicker with every passing Hogwarts year?  Well, so does the life of an adolescent.<br />I cannot agree withthose who gasp with delight at every Harry Potter development or trumpet the series as the best of all time, hence I must give \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" four stars rather than five.  (I should add that, although I actually consider \\"Goblet of Fire\\" the best Potter story to date, it outdoes \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" by only a hair's breadth.)  On the other hand, I re-read the first volume not long ago, and as good a read as it was, it was pretty formulaic as compared with \\"Phoenix\\".  Like I said, Ms. Rowling improves fast, and her series has indeed developed into something that approaches the unique.  As a teacher, I would stop worrying about any young person who loves Harry Potter - such a youngster has a brain and a heart, very good news considering how popular these books have become.  And who knows - if I were 15 years old and reading this story for the first time, from the pen of a writer who really seemed to understand what I was going through, maybe I really would say it's the best series of all time.<br />Benshlomo says, Fantasy - it isn't just for babies anymore.those who gasp with delight at every Harry Potter development or trumpet the series as the best of all time, hence I must give \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" four stars rather than five.

US	52837146	RHSZ74J9A7VIJ	0375719296	661410034	Dr. Bloodmoney	Books	4	17	22	N	N	Prejudice, Paranoia, and the Bomb	The first image in this novel is that of a black man named Stuart McConchie sweeping the sidewalk in front of a Berkeley TV shop, eyeing the pretty girls on their way to work and indulging in some contempt for the approaching patients of the psychiatrist across the street.  In any ordinary novel, that image would tell you that the book is going to be about that black man and those patients.  In PKD, the image tells you that the book will be about prejudice.<br />The average author, to tackle that theme, would provide us with a group of unprejudiced characters battling a group of prejudiced ones and make it very clear which are the good guys and which the bad guys.  PKD was always a little too smart for that.  Just about every character in \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" is suspicious of pretty nearly every other character he or she meets at one time or another.  That includes several characters who have good reason to be suspicious - Bruno Bluthgeld, for instance, the Dr. Bloodmoney of the title, who believes himself personally responsible for the nuclear exchange that brings the world to its knees.  Hoppy Harrington, too, has good reason for his suspicions - he's a telekinetic biological sport with no arms or legs at a time when atomic radiation has produced talking dogs and musical rats, so everyone's been looking at him funny his whole life; he's not just imagining things.<br />However, the culture of suspicion even affects little Edie Keller and the undeveloped but quite powerful twin brother in her body.  The culture of suspicion gets to Edie's father, George, who thinks his wife is cheating on him (he's right).  It affects everyone, even the best of men and women.  About the only character with no prejudice to speak of in \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" is Walt Dangerfield, left stranded in an orbiting satellite by the outbreak of war, and his lack of suspicion eventually leaves him the most vulnerable of all.<br />The good guys, in other words, are highly intolerant of anyone or anything new.  PKD makes good use of the irony that this xenophobia blinds the people of West Marin County to the dangers that Bruno Bluthgeld and Hoppy Harrington pose to them directly, simply because both men have been around them for awhile.  There are plenty of mainstream novels which deal with that very subject - you could name ten or more in less than five minutes - without the necessity of dragging in nuclear war and mutant mental powers.<br />In short, this is maybe the least SF that an SF novel could possibly be.  This is not necessarily a criticism, of course - in fact, it would make \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" an excellent entry point into the works of PKD except for one thing.  The story doesn't really get moving until about a third of the way in.<br />The novel is one of PKD's longest, and he spends a good bit of time on the events of the day the bombs come down.  The story proper, however, begins seven years later, when a worldwide culture of semi-rural enclaves has settled into its routine, loosely knit together by communications from the man in the satellite.  The opening events have little or no connection to the main plot, although there's a nice description of World War III as seen through the eyes of a man who just knows it's all a figment of his imagination.  Nevertheless, as nicely written as those passages are, I found myself thinking that \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" could have used a little tightening up.  Take the passage where a mushroom hunter watches Hoppy Harrington nearly get run down by a wood-burning truck.  Now there's a good opening scene, I thought - why not start here and add in all that backstory during the main plot instead of making me wait all this time?<br />So, one star off for some loose-jointed plotting.  Why not two stars off?  Because those first pages, although they dangle from the book like a participle, do not strike me as unnecessary.  Far from it - those pages contain some critical information, so critical that by the time the story proper kickedin I was thoroughly hooked.  They just needed to be woven in more tightly, that's all.  And PKD was notorious for writing fast and furiously - he needed the money.  One more crime to chalk up to the American publishing industry, I suppose.  Then again, they did publish \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\", warts and all - let's be thankful for what we've got.<br />And, to return to the point we started with, let's hope that \\"Dr. Bloodmoney\\" teaches us what life can be like when, like most of these characters, we lay aside our prejudices and work together to build something good.<br />Benshlomo says, Some good art, like some good life, is messy.in I was thoroughly hooked.

US	52837146	RZ9E02KJK6FX0	0020291256	518122634	Solar Lottery (Collier nucleus fantasy & science fiction)	Books	3	32	34	N	N	The Griping Hero	In 1955 Philip K. Dick was a prolific and moderately successful writer of SF short stories, but I seriously doubt that anyone really paid attention when \\"Solar Lottery\\" hit the shelves that year.  They should have.  It was one of the opening moves in the game that eventually tore the SF world wide open.<br />There were plenty of notable exceptions, of course, but early SF largely concerned itself with great men of tremendous vision and extraordinary ability who got in there and solved problems - the kind of man Robert Heinlein liked to write about.  PKD was among those later writers who noticed that most people in the real world aren't like that, and wrote stories about them instead.  \\"Solar Lottery\\" lacks his later interest in what makes something real (although it does include a conspiracy in which a man with no real personality drives a whole crew of telepaths crazy), but in Ted Benteley it contains an early example of his interest in regular guys.<br />As is often the case with PKD, Ted Benteley finds himself in a classic SF plot turned inside out.  In this case, the classic SF plot in question comes almost directly from a true genre classic, \\"The World of Null-A\\" by A.E. van Vogt.  In both novels, a man tries to make his way in the world by gambling his future on the game that forms whatever government exists around him, only to find that someone is cheating.  Van Vogt's protagonist is a typical post-World War II SF superman; PKD's is a talented but endlessly ticked off functionary who spends most of the novel trying to figure out what's going on.<br />Everything in his world depends on the random activity of an atomic device that determines the fates of millions - a lottery indeed, with one man at the head of it.  What's more, for most people, the best fate they can hope for is to bind themselves in servitude to someone of a higher social position, if any such person will take them.  Merit, ability and hard work count for nothing here, and there's no way up or out except by random chance for Benteley or for almost anyone else. If most early genre SF was about men of vision and courage saving the world by their own efforts, \\"Solar Lottery\\" was that SF's polar opposite.<br />Benteley is not as strong a hero as later PKD characters would be, partly because of his aforementioned nasty temper.  He's got plenty to be annoyed about - he gets a chance for escape at the novel's beginning and misses it because someone misleads him at a critical moment.  Nevertheless, dwelling in the mind of a character who's always complaining about something can wear on one pretty quickly.<br />Indeed, it's no easy task to sympathize with any of these characters.  In addition to their unpleasant traits - uncontrollable rage, treachery, lust for power, cowardice - these people switch attitudes so quickly it can make you dizzy.  The coward, for example, suddenly acquires a titanium backbone when the men who want to kill him actually show up.  Of course, PKD wrote \\"Solar Lottery\\" at a time when SF novels had to end at about 180 pages by the decree of the age's major publisher, so he probably did not have space to develop his characters more fully, but it's a flaw nevertheless.<br />The same can be said for the novel's plot elements - there are so many seemingly unrelated ones that the central story loses its focus a good deal of the time.  PKD was always among our least disciplined writers, and in addition to \\"Solar Lottery's\\" conspiracies and betrayals we also get telepaths, robotics, space travel and hints of nuclear catastrophe thrown in.  When we read a longer novel, these kinds of details can add a lot to the richness of the writer's world - in 180 pages it can give you indigestion if you read it too fast.<br />That overstuffed quality robs \\"Solar Lottery\\" of a good bit of its velocity.  I mentioned A.E. van Vogt - his take on this kind of story never lost energy for a second.  His stories picked up speed from the very first word and never stopped any longer than dreams do.  PKD missed out on that, but where he tops van Vogt is in the strength of his underlying theme.  \\"Solar Lottery,\\" for all its speed bumps, eventually makes you stop and think about what it takes to maintain one's integrity in a corrupt world.  Benteley spends a good deal of time complaining about the lack of decency all around him, and his carping can get old, but isn't that a particularly important thing to complain about?  And isn't it satisfying to see the protagonist of any novel, even a cheap genre piece, stand up and shake a fist at the thieves and the traitors no matter how much pressure they put on him?  Isn't that the kind of person you aim to be?<br />Oh yeah, people should have paid attention when \\"Solar Lottery\\" came out.  After all, it's about a regular person with no special powers or gifts, thwarting a great evil through the strength of his convictions alone.  After this, even Superman and his overpumped muscles looked a bit silly.<br />Benshlomo says, Sometimes it's enough to just tell the truth.ped any longer than dreams do.

US	52837146	RRV9N0TBZB2RN	0679752978	516892648	Galactic Pot-Healer	Books	4	14	15	N	N	The Author as 40-Ton Alien	When a man finds a job offer floating in his toilet, he's either desperate or in a Philip K. Dick novel. Joe Fernwright, the title character in this novel, is, of course, both.<br />We might consider it odd that a job offer in a place like that should lead Joe Fernwright to his life's purpose, but this is, after all, PKD's world; the job offer does exactly that. At the start of his story, Fernwright has little else to hold onto - his ex-wife thinks he's a joke and tells him so as often as possible, the craft of ceramic repair that he loves is useless in his plastic age, his government gives him no privacy even in dreams. It's part of PKD's brilliance to give us such a character - we believe that Joe Fernwright would accept the offer in his bathroom tank, just on the off-chance that it might restore his dignity and give his life some meaning.<br />The search for meaning is not an uncommon theme for PKD, but &quot;Galactic Pot-Healer&quot; is different in the extent to which Joe Fernwright's search is conducted alone. There's community in it, to be sure; on the other hand, Fernwright begins and ends the book in isolation, an unusual state for PKD characters. It's an important one, though, because although his isolation at the end of the book saddens him, he is content.<br />It would be unfair to suggest that he's content with his isolation because every other character in the story drives him crazy, but any reader might be excused for saying so. Most of these beings, human and non-human alike, change their attitudes from paragraph to paragraph for no discernable reason, which can get dizzying real quick. For instance, Joe has a love interest, Mali. Within the space of ten pages, she introduces herself to Joe with flattering interest, turns completely cold at a remark from him that she finds insulting, warms up again within minutes of his approach, humiliates him in front of a large group of people, and then takes him to bed. She never can seem to figure out how she feels about him, but it scarcely matters - neither can anyone else.<br />And if Mali is a bundle of neuroses, then Glimmung, the being who provided that toilet-tank job offer, is completely certifiable. Is it near-omnipotent or enfeebled? Calm and generous, or peevish and subject to towering rages if crossed? Tyrannical or profoundly grateful for its friends? Well, that depends on which page you're looking at.<br />Like the characters, the story lurches from mood to mood, theme to theme, a state of affairs that is not helped by the fact that Joe and Mali and Glimmung and everyone else suffer from Eloquentiasis. That's the disease that causes fictional beings to declaim on various philosophical points at the drop of a hat, instead of letting the story make their points clear for them. This sometimes produces an amusing or touching moment, as when Joe's ex-wife challenges him to prove that he can speak intelligently to her dinner guests and he launches into an analysis of Beethoven's music as opposed to Mozart's, but most of the time it just slows things down. Here, in addition, it confuses the heck out of anyone trying to find a narrative thread to hang onto.<br />And yet, despite all the technical flaws, this is still PKD, and as usual he redeems himself by the love he feels for his characters. Indeed, this story grips and moves because of that exact love and care - Joe Fernwright, self-involved loser, learns from the 40-ton Glimmung that all life is worth caring about. It is this that makes him, as Glimmung says, &quot;the best of them,&quot; the most whole of all Glimmung's hirelings, this that enables him to stand in isolation at the end and try something new. PKD was a big guy - I suspect he might have seen himself as the huge, gelatinous Glimmung, teaching his own character the way to love.<br />Speaking of which, I've got a soft spot for &quot;Galactic Pot-Healer&quot; for an additional, very personal reason. Early on, Joe consults an automatic adjustable clergyman for advice on how to proceed with his life. He goes through various religious settings and gets a lot of very spiritual advice. Just before his money runs out, he sets the device to Judaism, and it advises him to eat a bowl of soup. As a Jew, after I laugh myself silly at this, I say it shows very clearly just how much PKD cared about the children of his own mind.

Poor guy.  Fortunately for the reader of _Blindness_, this accident does not turn John Haye into a saint.<br />Now, you've all seen books and articles and TV shows about unfortunate victims who adjust to their new state and become an inspiration to all about them - lead them to victory or clarify their understanding of the good life or something like that.  If that's your cup of tea, _Touched by an Angel_ is on soon.<br />Rather, this novel is for those who are interested in what blindness might actually be like, with or without eyes.  Indeed, John starts out this novel with his sight intact, and uses it mostly to make foolish or cruel judgments about his fellow students, his dormitory manager, his family and his schoolwork.  After his accident his powers of observation actually improve as far as his sensitivity to his environment is concerned, but his knowledge of himself and his fellow human beings remains pretty sparse.<br />His opinion of his stepmother changes every few seconds, whether she's with him or not.  He meets a girl named Joan, falls hard for her, and tells himself the entire story of her life - all the while insisting upon calling her by the wrong name.  He considers his country home desperately boring until he gets to London, by which time that same country home turns in his mind to a virtual paradise.  This kid is a mess.<br />While John is thus kidding himself, of course, the characters who can see are doing just the same thing.  John's stepmother can't make up her mind from moment to moment whether to marry John off or keep him with her, or what to do with him - or herself, for that matter.  John's old nurse doesn't seem to realize whether or not John has changed at all from the time he was an infant.  John's would-be girlfriend Joan, daughter of an alcoholic former parson, thinks of the local men as the more attractive if they look as though they could hurt her, and can't make up her mind whether she admires her father or loathes him.  As for that alcoholic father himself - well, you get the idea.  None of these people, even those with eyes, can see anyone as they are.<br />But the novel is more than just an exercise in cheap irony.  Henry Green drew high praise from all of his contemporaries for at least one very important reason; he described life as exactly and honestly as possible.  He may have created in John Haye a bit of a bonehead, and a self-indulgent bonehead at that, but he also created an amazingly clear world for him to live in and a beautiful way of describing it.  And eventually, it's that same gift for genuine observation and sensitivity that saves John Haye from a completely self-pitying life and seems to give him some kind of redemption.  In short, this is the story of a bonehead who learns to quiet his mind and just watch the world.<br />So Green restricted himself to plain facts - accurate description of the physical world, his characters' inner thoughts - and refrained from any authorial judgment of any of his people.  He gave us true portraits of men and women from all social classes, with all their virtues and all their shortcomings.  And in limiting his writing to mere reportage, he successfully guided his readers through a blind man's world and showed us the true meaning of blindness itself.

US	52837146	RDIL0NM5E99PF	0679736662	125782880	The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch	Books	5	2	4	N	N	Redeeming the Pusherman	One of PKD's acknowledged classics, and the one where all his more bizarre obsessions - drugs, paranoia, the fluid nature of reality - unite.  He wouldn't really bring it all home as powerfully again until _A Scanner Darkly_.<br />As with most classics, we might find it hard to judge this novel on its own merits.  It's tempting to give it high marks just because everyone agrees that it's a classic.  Well, it certainly deserves five stars, but why?<br />For one thing, in _Three Stigmata_ PKD finally mastered the art of story combinations.  I've complained in past reviews that some of his previous novels contained so many ideas you couldn't follow them too well - in this novel he got it right.  The plot doesn't simply jump, for instance, from a corporate office on Earth to a hovel on Mars; the corporate office produces something that the inhabitants of that hovel actually consume, and eventually one of the corporate employees may have to go there.  For another example, that corporate employee doesn't merely have problems, his problems are connected - it's because he might have to go to Mars that he can't handle the pain of his divorce.  And so on.  The incidents in _Three Stigmata_ form webs of force that drive the characters from place to place, which makes the novel much more involving.  And then it turns out that almost all those webs of force are in the control of a boogeyman.<br />Don't underestimate the power of a boogeyman tale, especially a tale for adults where the boogeyman has a mechanical hand, artificial eyes and steel teeth.  His name is Palmer Eldritch, and at first he's simply a new competitor that the protagonist has to deal with; he's pushing a new kind of drug that's much more effective than the one our hero has been selling.<br />Now, here's where things really start to get interesting.  Palmer Eldritch's mere presence forces our hero to confront the fact that he's a pusher.  What does he do about this new competition?  He calls upon his connections in government to get his competitor's product suppressed, that's what.  When that doesn't work, he hunts down his competitor with the idea in mind of killing him.  This is a hero?<br />Well, yeah.  Turns out that Palmer Eldritch isn't merely a businessman looking for a big score - he's after something much more insidious.  To save the world, our &quot;hero&quot; the pusher has to turn into a genuine hero after all.  What's more, to do that, he has to change his entire approach to life.  He's been in the business of selling an illusion, and he has to find a way to sell reality to a bunch of people who don't want it, himself included.<br />All of this is brilliant enough - a character who starts out as the mirror image of the villain and has to turn himself around for the sake of humanity.  PKD goes one step further.  There's another character here who's looking to rebuild his self-esteem after committing a crime, and he too has a choice; will he use his influence to escape the consequences of his actions, but turn himself into the kind of man his ex-wife despises?  Or will he give up all his privileges and accept exile to Mars, never see his ex-wife again but still be worthy of her?  He has to decide whether his comfort, or really his life, is worth his ability to look at himself.  When was the last time you read an SF story that even bothered to ask that question?<br />Like I said, _Three Stigmata_ deals with PKD's well-known propensity for drugs, paranoia and illusory reality, but like a lot of his work it's really a book about redemption, those who struggle for it and those who can't have it.  It's his stylistic genius that makes the book a classic, but it's his concern with redemption that makes the book worthwhile.<br />Benshlomo says, Some will find redemption and some will not, but we must respect all who seek it.s in government to get his competitor's product suppressed, that's what.

In the post-Cold War world, we might find an arms race allegory somewhat unnecessary.  On the other hand, in our age, we're still dealing with megalomaniacal fascism, international espionage for sale to the highest bidder, and the possibility that empathy might yet save the world.  I don't know about you, but I'm not so picky that I want to ignore all that.<br />Just what, I ask myself, got PKD down about this story?  My guess is that he was embarrassed by the heavily parodistic elements he threw in.  That is, at a time when East and West struggled to build terrifying weapons with (we hoped) no desire to use them, PKD wrote a novel in which East and West actually make an agreement to build terrifying weapons with no *intention* of using them.  At a time when the national police spied on its own citizenry, PKD described a world police without so much as a pretense of loyalty to any nation.  The most important citizen of the West, its chief weapons designer, is at least as self-absorbed as any fashion star of today, laboring under the constant knowledge that he's a fake.<br />In fact, the value of knowledge may be The Zap Gun's central theme.  Knowledge of the facts is at a premium all through the novel, but those who have it don't want it, those who lack it don't know it, and at the climax those who need it can't get it because the one who has it can't give it without jeopardizing the truth of it.  Rather than explaining that statement, I'll let you read the book - suffice to say that just about every character here is so accustomed to lying that they forget how to do anything else, and the only character who does tell the unvarnished truth is some kind of nut.  Puts me in mind of the last few presidential elections.<br />In short, many people of the 1970's suspected that government was in the business of putting one over on us, so PKD provided a vision of a future where government consciously pacifies the people with elaborate fictional war games.  Which actually works pretty well until aliens begin putting entire cities into stasis and everyone's forgotten how to wage an actual war.  Uh-oh.<br />I did find one serious logical flaw - the various weapons supposedly don't work, being produced just to keep a civilian review board busy finding uses for their components in kitschy consumer goods, but toward the end someone puts those components together and produces a workable laser weapon.  This kind of mistake isn't unusual in PKD, who often wrote so fast that I wonder if he remembered page 1 by the time he wrote page 200.  On the other hand, by the time he wrote The Zap Gun he could, and did, handle suspense very well.  His characters, while not as good as those in some of his other work, are sympathetic and touching.  Maybe most importantly, he found a way in this book to humanize the political and scientific struggles of the day.  Not many authors, or many people, can do that.<br />The Zap Gun is often a parody, and sometimes a cheesy one.  Like most of PKD's better work, it's also intensely moving and very funny.<br />Benshlomo says, If this is a turkey, bring on the cranberry sauce.le of the 1970's suspected that government was in the business of putting one over on us, so PKD provided a vision of a future where government consciously pacifies the people with elaborate fictional war games.

It's quite a good PKD novel, but it veers off in so many directions it's hard to get a grip on.<br />In his best stuff, PKD's focus can be truly awesome.  Even throwing in everything but the kitchen sink, his stories move.  Either everyone's racing toward the same goal, or everyone's under the influence of the same drug, or the actions of one person will save the world or end it - something.  What we've got here are good pieces of four or five different novels, and they don't really gel into one story until about two-thirds of the way through.  Once that happens, the novel improves real quick, but the ability to build a story from widely separated elements is a difficult trick and one that PKD didn't master until a little later in his career.<br />Granted, the same group of people remains more or less intact throughout, which helps the cohesion a lot.  They are all California landowners on an Earth where some wartime disaster has depleted human fertility.  They spend their time playing a game imported from the alien species native to Titan, which forces losers to trade spouses and land holdings.  Fine, but how are you supposed to identify with the group's struggle when the struggle keeps changing?<br />Story Number One is a thriller in which the group members try to stave off a hostile takeover from an East Coast conglomerate.  Story Number Two is a murder mystery in which they all realize that they have no memories of the time at which the murder took place.  Story Number Three is a conspiracy fantasy in which they confront a cabal of Homo Superior out to destroy them.  Story Number Four is a paranoid nightmare in which they must return to their game, this time against the Titans, for the Earth itself.  Game-Players of Titan is less a science fiction novel than a 200-page science fiction library.<br />Nevertheless, despite the patchwork, Game-Players of Titan is a greater piece than other PKD novels with similar flaws.  What saves it this time out is the author's attention to fleshing out his characters.  It's not perfect, but by the time the story is over the reader can recognize most of the members of the original character grouping just by their actions and manner of speaking - that's how you can successfully identify with them, not through the plot.  The original group consists of about eight characters, and five or so of them are fully three-dimensional - an excellent batting average, and one which PKD would improve upon later.<br />What's more, underneath all of the plot machinations is a genuinely inspiring story about a man contemplating suicide who recovers his love of life through meaningful work and a good relationship with his wife.  Pete Garden is an irritating whiner on the first page, a charismatic leader on the last, and that's a dramatic story well worth anyone's time.  You've got to dig for it, though.<br />So Game-Players of Titan is really a cheer for the guy who struggles unsuccessfully and comes close to despair, but goes out and fights again because his friends help him.  Regular readers of PKD's work will recognize this theme as the same dealt with so successfully in classics like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and Now Wait for Last Year.  Once again, the author proves that he's at least as much interested in love as he is in paranoia and the nature of reality, his better-known concerns.<br />Benshlomo says, Here's to the ones who don't stop when things get tough.greater piece than other PKD novels with similar flaws.

Try saying that three times fast.<br />Anyone who knows anything about Tom Wolfe will know exactly what to expect from this 1975 exploration of the 1950-1970 Art World. Considering that he's always on the lookout for something funny to say, he does quite a good job, probably because the Art World is apparently a pretty funny place. Then again, that's always true of any insular group that develops its own vocabulary and learns to take itself too seriously.<br />According to Wolfe, that judgment applies equally to the artists, their critics, and the small world of collectors that support them both. He uses as an example the following cycle: Jackson Pollack and Willem de Kooning paint a few pictures using mere blobs of paint. At about the same time, Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg conclude in their columns that painting must naturally go in the direction of increased &quot;flatness&quot; to fulfill its destiny (and they do, in fact, write in such semi-apocalyptic terms). To illustrate their point, Greenberg and Rosenberg talk up Pollack and de Kooning.  Art patrons in Milan, Rome, Paris and New York read the columns and get interested in Pollack and de Kooning. Thus encouraged, these artists paint even flatter paintings, Greenberg and Rosenberg chat them up even more in their columns, the Art World gets more excited, and round and round we go until a guy named Leo Steinberg smashes into the cycle. He declares that they've got it all wrong, the true &quot;flatness&quot; exists in the Pop Art of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, and the whole thing starts all over again. Only with even more feverish declarations of theoretical orthodoxy this time.<br />Eventually, of course, the theory becomes far more important in the Art World than the paintings. This gives rise to Op Art, Happenings, Conceptual Art, and the world we live in today wherein the answer to the question &quot;What is Art?&quot; is &quot;That which we find in Art Museums.&quot;<br />Wolfe splashes all this high comedy around in a truly scrumptious style, full of exclamation points. Behind the rhetoric, I suspect, is a man who thinks very highly of himself, but what else can we expect from a culture critic? Fortunately, what with all those exclamation points, it's fairly clear that Wolfe doesn't really take himself all that seriously, so his work is much easier to enjoy than it otherwise would be.<br />Even more interesting than the language, however, is the odd feeling one gets from The Painted Word that Wolfe doesn't think of the mid-century Art Follies as necessarily a bad thing, or even bad art. And indeed, who says that Art Theory is anything other than Art itself? Why criticize this development? Why not just enjoy it?<br />So in his last few pages, Wolfe predicts a retrospective in the year 2000. Instead of the paintings, this retrospective presents the true Art of the 1950's-1970's - the columns of Greenberg, Rosenberg, Steinberg, and whatever other Bergs in enormous reproduction, with tiny illustrations of the paintings in question next to them. As I write this, such an exhibit is nowhere yet to be seen, but that may only mean that Wolfe is smarter than the average museum curator (a supposition I can neither confirm nor deny). Be that as it may, Wolfe's craft is undeniable - sarcastic, informed, bitchy, and overwhelmingly funny. If the Word is Art, then the hyper-serious Greenberg, Rosenberg and Steinberg are mere wannabes. Wolfe, like Groucho Marx, is an Artist.<br />Benshlomo says, in the words of William Shakespeare, better a witty fool than a foolish wit.which we find in Art Museums.&quot;<br />Wolfe splashes all this high comedy around in a truly scrumptious style, full of exclamation points.

The man hadn't found his style yet.  In fact, in some ways he resembled his title character, certain that the future held great things but only able to see ahead towards more struggle.<br />Fortunately for us, PKD was a much better man than the Floyd Jones of this story.  Jones, unlike PKD, is a fascist, a xenophobe, and a weasel.  He is precognitive, sees the future, but only one year ahead.  He must relive even the most vile and unpleasant incidents twice over, and he can still be - and often is - wrong and wrongheaded.  All the more remarkable that the author should invent a character like that in the early days of science fiction, when those with mental powers were generally heroic.  Or at any rate oppressed and misunderstood, sympathetic characters for readers to identify with (think X-Men).  Once again, PKD takes a standard SF device and turns it inside out.<br />So much for the villain - in this case as in many others, the most interesting character in the story.  The heroes, a dedicated policeman and his radically-inclined wife, are by comparison a couple of marshmallows.  Unlike many fictional married couples, however, these two at least have an interesting relationship - bound by a great love but separated by clashing political beliefs.  Take the scene where the policeman learns that his wife has been working for a revolutionary underground behind his back for many months.  The moment is enormously moving, and would bring a reader to tears if the characters themselves had more than two dimensions each.<br />While all of this is going on, you have to consider a group of mutated humans, the most benign alien invasion in literature, and a desperate attempt to colonize Venus.  Why did PKD throw in all this extra material?  The temptation is strong to say it was because all science fiction of the 1950's had to have mutants, aliens, and space travel.  The later PKD had more confidence in the products of his imagination than in such clich&eacute;s.<br />That, in a nutshell, is the problem with this book - in far too many places it reads like a sort of technical schematic for a PKD novel, not the novel itself.  If you took any second-class genre piece of its day and read it through a slightly warped pair of glasses, you'd get stuff like this - enough mutation to call attention to itself, not enough to really intrigue.  It's an adequate piece of experimentation and not much more.  PKD just hadn't given himself permission to really cut loose yet.<br />The World Jones Made has all the flaws of its time and its genre - there's too much incident for a 180-page novel, the action leaps from place to place and time to time until you get seasick, and the whole thing has that deadly aura of seriousness about it that we all remember from Twilight Zone.  Definitely not the place to start for the aspiring PKD reader - the author had a lot of growing to do after finishing this piece.  Happily, he did it in pretty short order and gave us greater work.<br />Benshlomo says, Everybody needs a little practice starting out.ience fiction of the 1950's had to have mutants, aliens, and space travel.

Remember those terrifying, unconquerable Martians from War of the Worlds?  We are not talking about those Martians here.  The Martians and the humans in this novel are quite ordinary, often weak, and occasionally nuts.  You want space opera, go watch Star Wars again.<br />On this Mars, our hero is a traveling repairman with a schizophrenic past.  Our villain is the president of the plumber's union.  Our damsel in distress is the villain's mistress, but she falls in love with the schizophrenic anyway.  The prize everyone is after is an autistic adolescent so terrified of physical contact that he can't see one person touch another without seeing them both decay on the spot.  And the character who triumphs at the end does so not because he's got a bigger gun, but just because he has compassion for a group of weak, dying Martian natives who can't possibly do him any good.  Never mind your typical SF novel, this isn't your typical novel of any sort, or your typical anything.<br />That's PKD for you - he takes you on a seemingly normal science fiction trip and immediately turns everything inside out.  That's part of what makes him brilliant.  The other part is that he understands all his characters, which is to say all human types, including the greedy and self-serving ones.  (This empathy for all types of people is all the more remarkable when you consider that his previous book, The Man in the High Castle, won a major award and he still couldn't get a hardcover book contract.)  The schizophrenic, the union leader, the autistic kid, the mistress - all they want is to be loved, like you and me.  Unfortunately, some of them (and some of us) learn that fact too late.<br />Of course, if one is living in a world where your choices are overpopulation and madness or emigration to Mars and endless struggle - a world in which mental illness is as frequent as the common cold, in which psychiatrists earn a living by replacing their patients at social functions instead of treating them - in a world like that, it's all too easy to overlook love and compassion.  That any of these characters manage to find, feel and express love is little short of a miracle.  You read Martian Time-Slip and, after you're finished saying &quot;What a weird story,&quot; you feel better about being human.<br />Martian Time-Slip is without question one of PKD's best works.  It has an entertaining and exciting story, it's full of intriguing ideas handled well, there's a nice balance of humor and intensity, and I promise you've never met characters like these before unless you've been reading PKD for a while.  Which isn't a bad idea, by the way.  He's a good tonic for the modern man and woman, beset from all sides by forces they don't understand but somehow able to stand up and take care of their friends at the same time, like these characters do.<br />Benshlomo says, The greatest triumphs are the small ones.g by replacing their patients at social functions instead of treating them - in a world like that, it's all too easy to overlook love and compassion.

The point of this song is that it's better to suffer torments in Hell than cruelty on Earth.  It's a pretty extreme attitude, to be sure, but many of the characters in PKD's novel would probably agree.  What makes this a remarkable book is that, even after that much pain, at least one character finds enough strength to hope.<br />One of PKD's chief critics has divided the man's work into about four periods, and calls Flow My Tears the transition into the last one.  What puts Flow My Tears at the nexus point between two great periods is that it wraps up the author's interest in thriller-style plotting and surreal story devices, and brings very much to the forefront his concern with, of all things, love.<br />As Jason Taverner moves through a dangerous world, it eventually becomes clear that he can't possibly survive without the help of a great many people, few of whom recognize him and all of whom place themselves in serious jeopardy just by speaking to him.  And then it turns out that even his greatest and most powerful enemy has a heart that can be broken.<br />PKD was always on the side of the regular guy, so it's not too surprising that the rich and famous protagonist gets little sympathy.  Instead, the book seems to be on the side of the folks he meets, including barflies, neurotics, simple craftspeople and activists.  They all try so hard to live with hope, even when there is none, and that includes the police - turns out the system tends to victimize them, too.  So when they capture the TV star Jason Taverner, despite the fear they inspire in him, it turns out they're really not that much of a threat.  Well, of course not; in Flow My Tears, the villain is the system, not the cops.<br />Perhaps this is why some other reviewers have been disappointed in the book's ending, and they have a point.  Flow My Tears does indeed lose power when Jason Taverner, a bright but not very nice guy, meets the police general Felix Buckman, and after all the running and terror it turns out that General Buckman isn't so dangerous after all.  Well, that doesn't bother me too much because PKD pulls off a neat trick and reestablishes the story's power - he shifts his attention from Taverner to Buckman and you realize that Flow My Tears was never Taverner's story to begin with.  We should have known.  Buckman is, after all, the title character, the weeping policeman.<br />Poor guy - as the story ends he's lost just about everything he has ever cared about (it's rather surprising to learn that he cares about anything, being our presumptive hero's nemesis and all).  Sobbing, he reaches out to the first human he can find, gets some comfort and understanding from him in a very moving way, and determines to reshape his life.  I get choked up every time I read it.<br />Okay, okay, PKD wasn't the world's greatest technician and even his best work got a little careless at times, but his audience loves him because he usually told them that their struggles were not in vain, that their lives meant something to him if to no one else, and that the machinery of the world was, in the end, weaker than they were.  In his best work I feel like he's given me permission to feel sad when I'm hurt, and that's nowhere more true than in Flow My Tears.<br />Benshlomo says, The mechanics are important, but the heart is vital.r, a bright but not very nice guy, meets the police general Felix Buckman, and after all the running and terror it turns out that General Buckman isn't so dangerous after all.

It contained the fictitious story of a certain man and woman and their totally divergent reactions to the woman's observation that they have been dating exclusively for six months - she immediately blames herself for putting too much pressure on him, he only takes note of the fact that six months is a long time between tune-ups.  It says all it needs to about the war between the sexes in some three pages - Shopgirl says more or less the same thing in 130.<br />Mind you, it's a charming story and rather touching in its way - the characters are cute (a little confused but they mean extremely well), and what happens to them is exactly what I'd like to have happen to me - but at times it feels a little empty.  It's kind of like cotton candy; sweet, but too much air for not enough substance.<br />On the other hand, if the story is a little thin, that fact gives the language a lot more agility than we usually find in romances.  The narrator skips from character to character, scene to scene, leaping over months of incident without even a mention.  He (or she) interrupts the story frequently to explain the differences between the characters' beliefs and the story's reality, making statements like &quot;What neither of them understands is that these conversations are meaningless.&quot;  Makes the whole thing read like a sociological study of modern urban mating habits, when it doesn't read like an updated fairy tale with Mirabelle as a barely ambulatory Sleeping Beauty and Ray as a miscast Prince Charming.  (It's worth noting that the identity of the real Prince Charming is a nice little surprise.)<br />Despite (or maybe because of) this veering between academic commentary and 21st-century myth, the narrator is undoubtedly the book's most intriguing character.  One gets a notion of him as a kind of combination radio psychologist and guardian angel, watching out for these people, making sure they learn the lessons they need to learn for their happiness' sake without getting hurt too much in the process.  And they do, in fact, learn their lessons with minimal pain.  Doesn't make for a very dramatic story - what it does do is allow us to live a pleasant secondhand life for a couple of hours before getting back to the blood and guts of our real lives, and there's nothing so wrong about that, after all.<br />I remember back in the early 80's when Steve Martin first came to national prominence, with his whole &quot;Excuuuse Me&quot; routine - I never would have guessed in those days that that wise guy could write a fluffy piece of whimsy like Shopgirl, but then he made &quot;L.A. Story&quot; and &quot;Parenthood&quot; (another couple of stories about quirky people in looking-glass worlds), and Shopgirl makes a lot more sense.  Steve Martin has moved in a few years from telling sarcastic stories about freaks to telling oh-so-sympathetic stories about good-hearted lost souls.  And these stories feel good, like a picnic in the park with your sweetie on a warm spring day, and they last about that long in the mind.  Great literature it's not, but it goes down quick and it makes you smile.

Doesn't make for a very dramatic story - what it does do is allow us to live a pleasant secondhand life for a couple of hours before getting back to the blood and guts of our real lives, and there's nothing so wrong about that, after all.<br />I remember back in the early 80's when Steve Martin first came to national prominence, with his whole &quot;Excuuuse Me&quot; routine - I never would have guessed in those days that that wise guy could write a fluffy piece of whimsy like Shopgirl, but then he made &quot;L.A. Story&quot; and &quot;Parenthood&quot; (another couple of stories about quirky people in looking-glass worlds), and Shopgirl makes a lot more sense.  Steve Martin has moved in a few years from telling sarcastic stories about freaks to telling oh-so-sympathetic stories about good-hearted lost souls.  And these stories feel good, like a picnic in the park with your sweetie on a warm spring day, and they last about that long in the mind.  Great literature it's not, but it goes down quick and it makes you smile.  That's not only harmless, it's probably necessary.<br />Benshlomo says, A little candy never hurt anybody.	2000-11-21
US	52837146	R3MFGO1DEZIAHI	0375407707	185430326	The Elementary Particles	Books	3	3	8	N	N	The Novel as Prescription Drug	I read this book because a newspaper review said it had managed to shock half of Europe, the only recent novel to pull off that stunt.  I can see why - I got little pleasure out of reading it, but when I finished it I felt I was a better person in some ways, and who wants to read a medicinal novel?<br />Well, we're all adults here and we do what's best for us even if it tastes bad, right?  Of course not, and that's one of the points of The Elementary Particles, which draws a bead on modern despair and tells us flatly that there's no way out for humans.  The book's two half-brothers, who genuinely want to connect and contribute on a very deep level, fail completely to do so - not because they're neurotic or atypical, but because they are just like everyone else, being born into a world that can't sustain them.  That's the way Houellebecq pulls off one of his neatest tricks, making us sympathize with a couple of losers.<br />Here's how it works: the narrator of The Elementary Particles is a member of a future species, created by humans from their own genetic material as a replacement for homo sapiens because they recognized that humanity had run out of ways to be happy.  This narrator interrupts the story constantly with half- incomprehensible scientific digressions, rigorously eliminates any emotion in describing the state of the characters, and makes it clear that humanity is an inferior species.  Despite all this, the new species admires people like the two main characters, just because they genuinely want to connect, they continue to seek love even when they know they won't get it.<br />As for M. Houellebecq's talents as a writer - well, on the evidence of this book, he's bitter and cynical about modern life, not at all convinced that things can get better, thoroughly disgusted at human beings and their behavior, and utterly unable to take any system of thought seriously unless it arose before about 1955.  I'm told this is a very French attitude - I have no way of knowing.  Whatever the national origin of his mind-set, it explains why he's gotten so popular in Europe - everybody hates him.  (Nothing like irritating the public to get its attention.)<br />Apart from that, he ignores the usual storytelling virtues, such as a sympathetic lead character, a clear storyline and an ability to make the reader identify with the plot and theme.  Anyone who can dump all those things and still move us has something going for him.<br />So it's a miserable story told by a coldly analytical narrator about depressed and often pathetic people who, as a solution to their problems, embrace a course of action that most of us would find totally unacceptable, but it manages to be uplifting.  By the time the thing was over I was a mass of contradictory emotions - about half sadness and half inspired hope, with a pinch of horror and a dash of intellectual interest.  You don't ignore a story like that, however else you may react to it, especially with a closing line like &quot;This book is dedicated to mankind.&quot;  It's worth going through a little unpleasantness to reach that conclusion.<br />Benshlomo says, Let's all grow up and take our medicine.knowing.

US	52837146	R4P7R9IBTG778	030680901X	677571441	The Heart Of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Every Made	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Trying to tell a stranger about rock and roll	Dave Marsh, the author, is right; however much it looks like one, this isn't a best-of list.  It tries to tell a single story (no pun intended), that of pop music in the latter half of the 20th century.  According to the  introduction, the book intends to change the conversation about this  music.<br />Most critics seem to believe that rock and soul emerged all of a  sudden in the 1950's as a marriage of R&amp;B and country music, and  evolved in gigantic leaps forward about every 15-20 years, between which  nothing much happened.  This book, on the other hand, asserts that the  music developed slowly, from a huge range of styles, and continued to  progress in a more or less unbroken line from that point onward.<br />That  story would make a good book all by itself.  Trouble is, The Heart of Rock  and Soul is too ambitious - it has a few other stories to tell, too.  It  wants to teach that modern pop music is not exclusively about rebellion but  also about reconciliation; it wants to show that rock and soul is for  adults as well as kids; it wants to demonstrate that this music is not just  one thing, but many, and that it has survived for that reason.  All of this  is a pretty tall order, and as good a writer as Dave Marsh is, it's too  much for him, especially being cast in list form.  (Although, truthfully, I  can't think of any other format that would serve better.)<br />Then there's  the fact that despite the author's protestations to the contrary, these  essays are pretty conservative.  They like the old virtues, such as rhythm  and feeling, so they get confused easily when it comes to progressive rock,  and the understanding of funk and rap in them is pretty elementary.  (Not  that my understanding of those styles is much better, but then I didn't  write a book.)<br />So as an academic study, The Heart of Rock and Soul falls  short.  Where it succeeds brilliantly is in the individual essays.  Marsh  is very good at combining singles into thematic groups; for instance, he  points out that the singer of &quot;My Generation&quot; could easily grow  up into the singer of &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, and it makes sense.  He's unafraid of getting emotional; the grown-up-too-soon girls he  remembers when he hears &quot;Soldier Boy&quot; will have you looking at  your anonymous neighbors in a whole new light.  He uses pop tunes like  &quot;Running on Empty&quot; and &quot;Roll Me Away&quot; to reassure us  that growing up is not the same as selling out.  He explains his reasons  for almost ignoring the Coasters, and you grieve for America's lost  innocence (it's a cheesy phrase, but you really do).  He even finds the  reason why that piece of schlock &quot;We Are the World&quot; actually  brings a lump to the throat, a discovery which is by itself worth the price  of admission - I'd been wondering about that for years.<br />Best of all is  when he gets personal.  &quot;Sometimes I feel that Smokey Robinson raised  me from a pup.&quot;  &quot;There are greater tragedies [than the Band's  story], but that one's sad enough for me.&quot;  &quot;My mother taught me  to buy singles.  Actually, she thought she was teaching me the opposite but  you know kids.&quot;  I've felt things like that, and so have you - like  the best pop music, Dave Marsh is most universal when he's most individual.  His essay on how he overcame racism by listening to &quot;You've Really  Got a Hold on Me&quot; could break your heart.<br />A near-miss at convincing  the mind, and a resounding success at reaching the heart, this book is.  I  don't know about you, but I like it better this way.<br />Benshlomo says, Tear  down the walls around your soul and some people, at least, will believe  you.instance, he  points out that the singer of &quot;My Generation&quot; could easily grow  up into the singer of &quot;Born in the USA&quot;, and it makes sense.

When authors trust their readers enough to challenge them, I cheer.  I do not, however, enjoy books that break promises, and like it or not that's exactly what Infinite Jest  does.<br />Unlike other unconventional novels, such as the works of the  oft-mentioned Thomas Pynchon, this one seems to prefer nasty tricks to  genuine communication - it implies it's going to tell a complete if  complicated story and doesn't deliver.  That's the sort of thing  well-educated showoffs do.  It's one thing to subvert expectations, quite  another to waste someone's time.  Infinite Jest is nothing more than a  shaggy-dog story.<br />Consider this: At the beginning of this book we meet a  gifted young tennis player at an admissions interview for a prestigious  college.  Something is seriously wrong with him - his handlers desperately  try to keep him quiet, but it's no use, he tries to speak for himself and  babbles insanely.  Cut to Chapter 2, one year earlier, and this same young  man functions beautifully, quite in his right mind.  Clearly, the novel  intends to explain what happened to him, right?  Well, close to a thousand  pages later we not only don't know what happened to him, we don't even have  him in the narrative anymore.  That's worse than a mistake, it's a  cheat.<br />Don't get me wrong, David Foster Wallace has plenty of great ideas  and a skillful way with the language, but it doesn't add up to anything -  that's the frustration.  For instance, in addition to the young tennis  star, we meet dozens of other brilliantly-conceived characters and learn  the fates of exactly none of them.  The settings are elegantly detailed,  from a tennis high school full of secret passages to the train-station  restroom home of a dying junkie, and none of them have any impact on any  character from the first page to the last.  The time period described, a  few years into the world's future, includes several intriguing postulations  from our current society, all of them dead ends.  There's a cult for ugly  people, a cross-dressing federal agent, a group of terrorists in  wheelchairs, a lost movie that captures the minds of all who view it, and  couple hundred more ingenious devices, not one of which changes a damn  thing.  Wallace's famous footnotes are more engaging than his story.<br />In  all fairness, this author probably set himself an impossible task; he has  tried, like many another writer, to encompass an entire world in his pages.  Unlike others, he doesn't know when to shut up.  Infinite Jest reads as  though he wrote until he got bored, then stopped and foisted the results  off on the world.  If he couldn't finish what he started, the least he  could do is keep it to himself.<br />Some have said that those who don't like  Infinite Jest should stick to pulp romances, but the issue is not  comprehensibility; it's the covenant with the reader, which says that a  book should deliver what it promises.  Infinite Jest, I repeat, doesn't do  that.  I'm delighted that so many have gotten so much pleasure out of this  doorstop of a book - at least all those trees died for some useful purpose  - but that doesn't excuse David Foster Wallace, who by the evidence of this  work seems to believe that mere cleverness is enough to produce good  writing.  He's wrong.<br />Benshlomo says, Don't make promises you can't  keep.society, all of them dead ends.

US	52837146	R2BDPEV1ZMW9OR	0679735771	92932803	American Psycho	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Display in the Yuppie Museum	It's all been said: Parts of this book are disgusting and/or hilarious; you can take your pick between calling it a deranged male revenge fantasy and a brilliant satire; the mere fact of its publication is cause either for hope and joy or for an agonizing reappraisal of our previous standards of judgment, etc. I'm not about to waste anyone's time rehashing the controversy. Unfortunately, that leaves me with nothing to consider - this book basically doesn't exist.<br />How exactly is one to assess American Psycho, anyway? It violates all the traditional rules of fiction, to be sure, but that's not necessarily a bad thing - plenty of experimental writers have produced great art by violating the traditional rules. The problem here is that Ellis left out all the traditional virtues, like plot and character and theme, and replaced them with nothing but a number of laundry lists - lists of suits and dresses, lists of appetizers and entrees, lists of body parts. (The writing style is exactly the same for all of these lists, but that's part of the conversation about the book, and I promised you I wouldn't go into that.)<br />In short, American Psycho is a sort of post-ironic Sears Catalogue. Any assessment of it as a scathing indictment of materialism, an antifeminist manifesto, a psychological thriller, seems tacked on - the book doesn't really read like any of that. Consider that the narrator's level of involvement in his own life when digging into his lunch is exactly the same as it is when digging into a woman's body with his bare hands - to wit, nonexistant. Satire is a comment on something; American Psycho is no comment on nothing.<br />The novel has its fascinations - it haunted me for a few days wondering just how far it would go - but it's ultimately unnecessary. Once you know that it's about a rich young Wall Street yuppie who murders people in his spare time, you don't need to read the book. It doesn't exist. The controversy over it will last long after it fades out of print. It's a historical artifact, not a novel.<br />So American Psycho gets two stars for provoking some interesting discussions, and loses the other three for failing to participate in those very discussions.<br />Benshlomo says, When the story about the story is more interesting than the story, there's no story.out of print.

US	52837146	R28MF1YRTS3I26	0802135765	937401692	Great Apes (Will Self)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Not More Fun than a Barrel of Monkeys	The problem with satire is that good satire can be compassionate, kindly and full of wounded idealism, which gets overlooked because of the funny stuff. Bad satire, on the other hand, is not funny. I'm happy to report that Great Apes is an example of the first kind.<br />Will Self writes like a horny adolescent with a flashlight under the covers at night while his parents are asleep. He spells out simian grunts every few sentences, drools over family members having sex at breakfast, lets his characters slap and bite each other when they get upset. Then he theorizes that humans are insane because they don't touch each other enough, which is just what a virgin without opportunities would like to believe. Indeed, all of this is a high-school wish-fulfillment fantasy of a kind that I for one, as an alumnus of an all-boys high school, sympathize with. (And you can keep your snide remarks to yourself.)<br />Now, once you get past all these monkeyshines (sorry), there's a very touching story here. It's about an old man who thinks he's past his prime; he gets an opportunity for some vastly fulfilling work and a renewed sense of purpose, helping a new friend who has lost his family and his identity. That's the kind of tale we could all use, but you only get it once you push past the satirical flotsam, and who has the time, right?<br />You may ask, if the author had such a moving little story in him, why he buried it in all the banana peels. Good question, and the only answer I can come up with after reading this thing is that he did it for fun, which isn't quite good enough. I suppose you could say it's to make a comment on our need for connection and contact - there's a scene here where Simon Dykes, trying to recover his sanity, attacks his therapist and gets warm encouragement for it becaause that's good chimp behavior. The implication is that in a world of humans, where touching is taboo, Simon Dykes might never get well. Yeah, you could say that, but the book tastes different. Will Self seems a little too gleeful over his chimps and their antics, like a kid at the zoo watching the apes make out.<br />So you have to dock Will Self a star for hiding his heart, but let's give him three cheers anyway for his guts. Actually, let's give three cheers to anyone who even thinks about the big emotions in this post-ironic cyberworld. Don't let the wisecracking and giggly sexuality fool you - Will Self has clearly done his homework when it comes to chimp social behaviors, he's thought hard about the implications of his material, his chimp world makes plenty of logical sense, and he's very funny. He wanted to tell a real story about real people and he was willing to make a fool of himself to get our attention. Like a lot of adolescents, he's a brave boy at heart.<br />Benshlomo says, If you have something important to say, make people listen to you by any means necesary.erent.
