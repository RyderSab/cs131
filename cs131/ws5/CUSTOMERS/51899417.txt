This book definitely qualifies as compelling entertainment to those who find the \\"behind-the-scenes\\" behavior of celebs interesting, but I'm STUNNED at this guy's \\"moronitude.\\" He doesn't let himself entirely off the hook in his misdealings, but he plays himself off as a victim..when his CONSTANT weakness in fulfilling the insane demands of certain nightmarish celebrities makes him contemptible beyond belief. I wanted to like Tonken - he tells a breezy story & is apparently paying the price for his participation in financial scams...but I didn't find much of a soul there. To get involved with Roseanne at the late date he did shows judgement that can't really be justified. I would have liked to hear more about the (perhaps few) GOOD Hollywood/Washington, D.C. people - he alludes to them from time to time but goes back to the same self-indulgent nonsense of the others. It's a good read but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Nothing he wrote was a true shock (except, as mentioned before, Ray Charles' alleged cavalier acts)...but as seen through the eyes of someone who clearly has NOT learned from his misdeeds, it didn't really satisfy.	2005-07-31

This book is a joy! Garry Marshall is a fine writer of jokes for stand-up comedians of yore, sitcoms &amp;, apparently, of full-length show biz autobiographies. He discusses his life in an extremely entertaining way. His asides - about moviemaking, camerawork &amp; tips on the directing/producing process - are enjoyable for everyone, not just aspiring filmmakers. There are (truly) laugh out loud sections as well (Two Words: Kathi Wathi)...this is a man who seems to live his life with passion &amp; decency &amp; drive, ALWAYS with the added bonus of humor. Yes, he dishes the &quot;dirt&quot; about his celeb peers, but in a completely non-malicious way. Best of all, here's a man who accomplishes much but doesn't take himself too seriously. Good-humored, good-hearted, crisply written &amp; hilarious. Can't recommend this book highly enough!	2003-10-26

This book is a REAL disappointment, especially since it was written by Cooney who's usually so great at spinning out quirky, memorable, compelling characters & situations. This book - even with its framework of \\"real-life soap opera\\" & presence of teen angst, sibling rivalry & mental illness, stayed one-dimensional for me. I kept waiting for the characters to be fleshed out...they stayed static. The romance between Sophie & Ted never came alive; the mom's craziness was used, almost cruelly, as a point of humor. Some of the writing is light & funny & I hung in there till the end, but this book will fall off the radar screen of my memory quite soon. Her other books have stayed with me.	2002-01-30

I recently bought &amp; re-read this book (at the age of 37) for the first time in 25 years. It holds up amazingly. An astounding tale of a female Holden Caulfield, a lovable outcast who pursues her anemic English teacher with a sincere, wholehearted, doomed obsession. The story's backdrop is fascinating as well - New York City in the mid-60s, hippie sensibilities beginning to show in the town but her own family mired in snooty Republican affluence. JF McAllister's parents are NOT proud of their androgynous, strong-minded, free-spirited daughter. But boy, they should be.

I LOVED this book...there's something about Margo &amp; her shyness, her confusion, her melancholy, that would seem to be a turn-off but she winds up being a genuinely moving, intelligent, worthy hero. Unusual theme for a teen novel - a shy girl's quest for acceptance at a snooty private school, being bounced from her obnoxiously slick roommates, her goony but sweet classmates &amp; TWO very unlikely-seeming romantic interests. One being absolutely right, the other absolutely wrong. Margo is absolutely unable to identify and/or fight off her enemies in the beginning of her story, but her growth is both striking, heartening and REAL. Once again, I loved this book! It stayed with me long after I put it down...for the first but not the last time. A teen novel with a most unusual slant.	2001-03-10

A pleasure to read this book about Amy, a high-schooler who blows it with guys over and over by forgetting to just be herself (mainly in quest of a prom date), but I don't believe this character could really exist to this extreme. Still, it's a nice wholesome account of a loving family, kind friends &amp; a sweet teen who loves literature &amp; knowledge &amp; seems to know or care nothing about sex, drugs &amp; rock and roll. A rose-colored-glasses look at high school in the affluent 'burbs in the early 80s. Fun &amp; sweet.	2001-01-19

This sort of New-York-Women-on-the-prowl-for-richer-men thing has been done before &amp;, to my mind, a bit better, by Rona Jaffe in her novels from the 50s &amp; 60s. Funny how the more things change, the more they remain the same - particularly when it comes to those who aspire to pointless, trendy, showy wealth. Still, these stories are mostly light fun reads - with characters you love to hate. I particularly enjoyed the marriage between the 2 soulless Yuppies, but felt disturbed by the ongoing theme throughout the book...do women like this really exist in any sort of numbers? Bushnell's got a strong, on-target, witty voice for this sort of character, but I didn't really, in the end, want to spend THIS much time with them.	2001-01-10

Although there's almost every Married Man-Single Girl (using the term &quot;girl&quot; advisedly) cliche going on here, this is one guilty pleasure of a book. It explores, in diary form, the inner lives of those involved in a doomed affair between Liza, a massively insecure, career-obsessed Yuppie &amp; Dan, a supposedly straight-up guy with a frigid-ish wife, 2 pre-adolescent girls &amp; an inability to commit to much of anything. The setting: Upper-crust Manhattan, late '80s. The characters: Way too clueless &amp; soulless &amp; easy on themselves for comfort. Though Maggie, Dan's wife, is portrayed as the put-upon victim, no one comes off well. Certainly not Liza who I THINK the author is trying to present empathetically, but who I found to be self-serving &amp; irritating beyond belief. Still...the writing is breezy &amp; on target, the situations involving (if predictable). This is a fast, memorable read about a bunch of indulged people who cut themselves way too much slack.	2000-12-31

This is a readable story of an overweight, shy, somewhat insecure girl whose world is rocked when her mom dies &amp;, within a little over a year, moves to a new home with a new stepfamily. Anne Emery was a much-beloved teen novelist of the 1950s &amp; '60s, and her writing style seems somewhat odd in this relatively late-date book. No references to drugs, drinking, more modern pursuits, though she does tell a side tale of a disturbed teenage boy with both compassion &amp; insight. Interesting family dynamics going on here, though a little watered down for the times. Worth a read, though. Anne Emery always is.	2000-10-03

There's one pretty powerful scene  involving the family's misguided attempt to take her out to a celebration  dinner, but the rest of the book seems to wallow in shallowness. The  characters just aren't fleshed out enough...no one will stick with you  after the book is closed.

Still, Jong-Fast has a facile  style &amp; I'd love to see it applied elsewhere...maybe as a columnist or  journalist or maybe she'll get more profound as she gets a bit older.

It's put forward as a warts-and-all, true to life account of what happens when a girl runs away from home (in this case, a basically loving home because of  the SEEMING oversight of her birthday), but it's soft &amp; gentle to the  point of fairy tale. The dialog is unrealistic, especially that of the  &quot;bad guys,&quot; and the ending partially defies logic. BUT. I loved  the dated-ness of the book, its good intentions, and the believable  kindness of some of the characters. Enjoyed the accounts of a young girl  staying at a hostel of sorts without friends or money, and the descriptions  of her dreary assembly line job.

My interest in this book was high because of the build-up of the 3  other(mostly)fine books, and desire to finally KNOW something of Hannah's  fate kept me immersed in the book until the end. Still, lots of frustration  here: it's essentially a rehash of the earlier material, with a complete  vanishing of some characters &amp; a pointless emphasis on a cartoony,  annoying girlfriend who is meant, I believe, to represent the callous  outside world. I don't know. I feel disappointed in this pat,  over-simplified wrap-up of a fascinating, flawed, believable bunch of  decent people. Cooney may have wrung all the &quot;good stuff&quot; out of  it.

Just snapped this book up recently at a specialty bookstore &amp; highly recommend it for anyone who is a Marx Brothers fan. Or an Algonquin Round table fan. Or an &quot;Old Hollywood&quot; fan. Anecdotes abound. But woven  into the story is that of a diehard Groucho Marx buff who inhabits the  tight, peculiar, often sad world of his last few years. Stoliar comes off  as a decent guy with his heart in the right place, a relief since Groucho  was surrounded by more than a couple of people with selfish ulterior  motives towards him in the end. Erin Fleming, Groucho's companion in his  last years, is intriguingly revealed as a complex, disturbing madwoman.  Painfully sad read, but with the saving graces of humor &amp; insight. Much  of this was actually covered in Arthur Marx's book, but check out the  different slant! I'm glad I read &amp; own this book. I'll be back at it  again.	1999-08-07

GIRL is a powerful, unapologetic account of a  semi-rebellious teen that lures you right into the world of high school angst/indecision &amp; keeps you there. I was prepared to dislike Andrea Marr at first, with her typical  teenage jargon, her obsession with coolness, her unsure take on her own  taste in music/friends/clothes, but I related to her to a degree that  almost made me cringe. Despite the generation/geography gap (I'm about 20  years older &amp; a lifelong New Yorker),I felt her unsureness, her  willingness to explore her dark side without totally abandoning herself to  it. It was interesting to get immersed in the alternate-rock scene of the  mid-90s Pacific Northwest, something unknown to me prior to this, but her  situation is universal...a fairly standard teen discovering her  loyalties/sexuality/&quot;image&quot; and finding her place in the  world.<br />For all her self-absorption &amp; obsession with crowd-pleasing  she's basically good-hearted, apparently book smart, and comes from a  solid-sounding family (they're there, on the fringes of her story but  typically take a VERY back seat). She also has the sense to be drawn to  some colorful, compelling friends; I'd like to get the real story on all of  them, particularly the mysterious and wounded Cybil.   <br />All in all, a  realistic, involving take on a flawed, evolving but hopeful EveryGirl. Lots  of great bleak sex throughout, vividly capturing the confusion of early  obligatory teen experimentation mixed with real desire. Hope it gets better  for Andrea. Blake Nelson, a guy in his thirties, really nails the inner  voice of a teenage girl...wonder how he did that?? It was a pleasure to  crawl inside her brain.	1999-05-30

I became a big fan after reading &quot;Lucky Jim&quot; and  have since read and enjoyed many of his other books, but this remains far  and away the all-time favorite.

The heroine, Leila Sand, is thoroughly baffling; too arrogant to be likable, too appeasing &amp; long-suffering to seem hateful, not easy to relate to or sympathize with.  There's no &quot;rootin' interest&quot; here...Leila drinks, drugs, paints,  gallivants and occasionally plays with her twins. The Twelve-Step talk is  heavy-handed, doesn't translate well here and comes off all wrong somehow.  There are so many dangling story lines that there's no closure or relief in  sight.<br />Having said all that, I read it cover to cover in one sitting,  never lost interest, enjoyed the satellite characters &amp; got off on some  of the humor. Jong at her worst will do this much for me. So it's an okay  read. But nowhere near the integrity and poignance of Fear of Flying,  Parachutes &amp; Kisses and How to Save Your Own Life.

The story is typically breezy  &amp; fast-paced, peopled with characters you love to hate &amp; people you  wish you knew in real life. It's also a fascinating condemnation of  Hollywood in all its soul-destroying, middle-age-hating, superficial glory.  <br />No Nobel Prizes here, but a wonderfully escapist few hours are available  for those who indulge.

I'm 35, &amp; have read this book many times since childhood. I loved Jean's likable awkwardness, her loving and supportive family, her tight relationship with an even more awkward best friend. The charm of this story  was in the painfully familiar adolescent details: mortification on being  dressed completely wrong; tailing a crush all over and calling on weak  pretexts; slighting a &quot;dorky&quot; best friend to earn a place with  the popular crowd, etc. All the characters just jumped out at me. There's a  definite edginess to the writing that I haven't seen elsewhere: Johnny is  portrayed as a vain, shallow jerk...but in the end not only does he go  unpunished &amp; unguilty for his selfishness, but Jean still carries a  torch!

Quite dated (takes place in the early 50s)  but still a steamy and believably accurate account of what transpired for  women venturing out on their own at the time...the brilliant, driven,  heartbroken college grad; the sweet hayseed who loses her innocence; the  &quot;bad girl&quot; who pursues an acting career only to lose everything  over a cruel mentor; a single mom who exudes quiet strength &amp; dignity  and an absolutely provincial chick from the Bronx who smugly pursues her  housewife destiny and is none the worse for it. They all surface at a  large, glitzy publishing house for a time and live with the rampant,  blatant sexism that was typical for the times but seems horrifying today.  An ultra-enjoyable read with memorable, fully fleshed-out characters.	1999-04-24
