I have a lot of respect for Laurence Block, and I think he's done some great stuff.  That said, I wish he'd do some more of it instead of grinding out books like All the Flowers are Dying.  To begin with, the whole \\"serial killer\\" thing is a cop out.  Although this one appears to tie in with the past, there doesn't really have to be any motive or reason or connection, just a \\"crazy killer\\" out there!  Makes it a little easier to put together the story. <br /> <br />Also, Matt's become something of a holier-than-thou pain in the neck since sobriety.  Now he's started on smoking.  I couldn't believe the subplot wherein a woman who wants her man investigated appears to be attracted to him mainly because he's a smoker. Kind of ridiculous.  Of course, as Matt confides, he does plan to quit for economic and long-term health reasons--he just thought she needed to know that.  Tongue in cheek or what?	2005-08-08

It's not really even a story.  Just following Mix around while he gets drunk, knocks people off, buries them, and as a sideline, stalks Nerissa.<br /><br />Not one character feels real or even believeable.  Gwen, a modern-day Miss Haversham, with her pathetic attachment to the only man she's ever known living in a house that supposedly hasn't been cleaned for 30 years; Mix, product of the classic and overworked abused child syndrome, cranky lodger and murderer; Nerissa, naive super-model(?) with a yearning for the boy next door; Madame Shoshana, medium who owns a gym on the side; two busybody \\"friends\\" of Gwen's who appear to have absolutely nothing to do and make it their business to drop in and be unpleasant.<br /><br />What a disappointment!	2005-06-20

What makes Brett's other work so great is the wit and polish of writing and the great characterization. Neither quality is apparent in this series. The two main characters are shallow stereotypes of the middle-class civil servant and the free spirit who have somehow come together over an interminable glass of white wine.  To compare these to a Miss Marple is ludicrous.  This one is particularly inane...the deep, dark family secret, the weak nephew, the vicious do-gooder, the ambitious administrator, the self-important bureaucrat, the unprincipled American academic (by the way, Americans do not pronounce &quot;God&quot; as &quot;Gard&quot;), the escaped convict and even the handicapped child!

When their grandfather is foisted on them by the utterly unbelieveable Aunt Coomy and Uncle Jal, Roxanne and the children try to make the best of it, while Yezad only makes life more difficult for everyone. Leaving Roxanne to care for the &quot;chief&quot;, Yezad spends his time selfishly resenting every moment she's not dedicating to his comfort. I got awfully tired of his self-pity and selfishnes. I would have enjoyed learning more about Nariman and less about Yezad, as Nariman was the more interesting, sympathetic character.  The children are delightful and appear much more mature than their father.  I also agree with another reviewer--there were some ridiculous situations.  Why would Coomy and Jal ruin their flat to justify keeping their father away?  They didn't appear to need any reason anyway; no one was doing anything about it. I became bored and depressed way before the end of the novel...when, by the way, it got even more depressing! Poor Nariman!  After all he's gone through, to have to put up with a son-in-law who has become as bigoted as his own parents.  And so goes the circle--ending up just where the book began.	2003-05-27

This was such a disappointing book for a Simon Brett fan like myself I was left wondering why he'd put his name on it.  The likeable, if flawed, characters of Mrs. Partager and Charles Paris are what makes those books so winning.  Here, the characters are not only unlikeable, they are shallow, wooden and one-dimensional. Instead of showing us personalities by &quot;action&quot;, he &quot;describes&quot; what people are like. These are not direct quotes, but examples of writing style--&quot;Jude is a very outgoing person who is attractive to many people, including most men&quot; or &quot;Carole is a rather shy, diffident person who likes to be around Jude and is curious about her free and easy lifestyle&quot;).  Thank you for telling me, but I'd rather figure that out myself from the character's behavior.<br />Usually, Brett's writing is witty and urbane. It was hard to swallow stuff like...&quot;Jude was thinking about the man in London she'd had a relationship with&quot;...hmm.  Wouldn't she be thinking about him by name?  Or, after a description of Brian Helling...&quot;He was very dangerous.&quot;  Show me.<br />Also, the book was very poorly edited.  In the copy I read, at the climax of the action Brian Helling was called &quot;Nick Helling&quot;.<BR>So, I guess you can see I was disappointed! I hope if this series continues Brett will try a lot harder to make it worthy of his talent.	2002-04-24

Peter and Tim appear to be the only human beings in town, and you gotta wonder about the Wendy house.

I read it in one sitting and couldn't stop laughing. What wit! What understated horror! I was disappointed, however, with Shapiro's comments at the end of the novel. Was she trying to tone down what she'd written? With great political correctness, she says the narrator is just as responsible for what's going on as Dennis. How? What &quot;terrible things&quot; does she do to him? Who wouldn't plan his murder? What's nice about a man who leaves a trail of destruction and dead wives behind him? &quot;He cares&quot;?

It seems I've been reading a spate of books lately that start out wonderfully and quickly deteriorate.  This is another one.  The setup was  terrific--how would these two sisters relate to each other, what secrets  would Ursuline find out about her mother and perhaps her father as well,  how would they establish common ground?  What brought Joan Plum to want to  contact Ursuline in the first place and how would her life change as a  result?<br />The writing at the beginning was also very evocative; I really  felt an excellent sense of place.<br />However, great questions; few answers.   Ursuline is a well-developed character, but the others are little more than  stereotypes--especially Jeremy, the colonial drunkard exploiting  not-so-innocent young ladies of the third world.<br />Joan is completely  unbelieveable to me.  Purportedly, she came to Africa to find Ursuline and  bring her back to develop her fine artistic talent, but nothing comes of  it. When she finally gets her back to North Carolina, her interest in  Ursuline as an artist (and a person) appears to disappear completely and  she does nothing but abuse her emotionally. Her terrible experience in  Africa, which she blames on Gordon instead of taking responsibility  herself, seems to become an excuse for mistreating everyone around her (at  least until she's finally able to get into &quot;rape counseling&quot;.   Thank god there's an answer!)  Throwing in the token lesbian lover thing  was a little gratuitous as well.<br />Maybe picking one theme and really  developing it would have made this the great book it could have been.	2000-08-19

Poking out somebody's eye is no big deal.  No  wonder Temple Carol spends her spare time practicing boxing and perfecting  her karate kick.  I wondered how anyone ever got any sleep, as it was  perfectly possible his front door would be kicked in, his women raped and  their children sold into slavery by any one of a number of trios of  cro-magnons he might have offended by the color of his tie or the cut of  his jib.

He admits that even without Lily to  please he might have been bad.  <br />And Jack isn't REALLY bad, he's just a  little bit bad.  And considering what the world has come to, who could  blame him?  Ah, these are the traps the devil sets!  You can't help liking  the guy, and the people he does down deserve it so!  <br />I'm delighted to  report this is the first Keating book I've read--meaning I've got 49  wonderful stories to go!  Keating reminds me of Donald Westlake--a very  complimentary comparison.<br />Great fun.  But--I hate to admit--I don't  understand the ending!  I missed the twist! That's a recommendation...I  hope I do better next time.	2000-02-17
US	50720714	R1PIA8FVMQI9P	0425141969	198885616	The Hanging Valley	Books	2	11	24	N	N	Not Giving Up	Somehow I got the name, picked up a book, and was hoping to find an elegant new writer of English cozies.  Well, it didn't quite make it, but I'm not giving up.  <br />Characterization, characterization,  characterization!  The main flaw in this book for me was that I couldn't  really identify with anyone.  Inspector Banks is one-dimensional.  He has a  wife and children, but you only know it because he tells you.  Otherwise,  they have no reality. He demonstrates no ability to comprehend others  beyond whether or not they allow smoking.  (As a smoker myself, and thus a  member of a increasingly harassed minority, I know the feeling, but really.   It's not enough to hang your hat on about everyone's character or lack  thereof).<br />All the characters in this book were stereotypes...the bad  husband, the tortured and sexually repressed wife, the bad brother, the  good brother.  Everyone has more to them than meets the eye, but not in  this book.  <br />Nevertheless, it kept me interested--until the incredibly  predictable and hackneyed ending.  I almost laughed.<br />Peter, you can do  better.	1999-12-27

Did the same person write the story after Randall and Marcy got married?  Randall underwent an unattractive seachange.  Instead of being a  mixed up kid who does things you can understand and sympathize with, he  becomes a mean, angry man for no discernable reason. Then he turns around  again and becomes a loving husband and son-in-law.  So what if his wife has  to go around with an eyepatch the rest of her life?  No problem.  The  shifts were just too great to work and the characters became  unbelievable.<br />I had the same problem as other readers with the lost  characters, some of whom were interesting.  And the ending!  It's sure a  good thing Dorothy met up with Doris Bailey to find out she still had a  chance to ruin her life.<br />McNeal needs to try again and write a whole book  next time.	1999-11-27
