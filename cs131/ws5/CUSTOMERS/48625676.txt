This is a good book to read to gain some understanding into the Indian culture and customs. Stories are told by different characters with different points of view about America, native customs, and people.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed the stories (although I didn't like certain endings).

However, once I got into it I found it interesting.  Olivia's letters mold her into a character. She puts down in writing what she sometimes can't say on the phone, or what others won't let her say on the phone. In a letter she has their attention, and can say anything she wants.    Olivia is a young movie producer, who after getting fired is forced to live in \\"strangers\\" apartments while she tries to make an epic with who else but the person who fired her. She is torn between her \\"last chance\\" to make it in the movie business, her sister's illness and a love that she lost.  Between flying across the ocean and driving from state to state, she tries to communicate with others in letters, which seem to be her outlet and a break from reality.    This is a good read, however because of the way it is written, the emotional aspect is a little clouded, hence the 4 stars. Nonetheless, it is a good book to read.	2005-05-08

The plot is original and intriguing.  <br />After Paul learns of his wife's death, he goes on a mission to find out what really happened. Looking for clues in his house to learn about Lexy's fall, he turns to the only witness, the family dog. His mission earns him ridicule from his colleagues, gets him involved with criminals, and makes him spend countless hours on the phone talking to strangers. <br /> <br />This is an interesting book, however, I only give it 4 stars since some of the clues and plot are a little predictable. If you pay attention, you will figure out Lexy's faith before Paul does. Still, it is a book well worth reading. <br />	2005-04-24

The book does not only guide you but also lets you adapt your own reading, problem solving techniques to maximize the use of the book.  <br />However, I do recommend putting in a lot of hours of studying. This book serves more as a guide, rather than a test tool.  <br /> <br />**Recommendation: Reading published journals on different topics, will get you used to the language and the format of writing.  <br /> <br />Good Luck!!!! <br />	2005-04-09

After getting arrested, stealing from his father, running away, and traveling to another city, he finds comfort in a person he didn't think existed.  <br />The writing is very clever and witty.

However, that was probably that biggest mistake, you should not approach this book as an addition to your SNTC experience or a rendition of the series. Although, most of the characters are somewhat the same there is a lot of difference (Don't picture Kristin Davis as Charlotte, because those characters are different).  <br />The book is very entertaining, and funny and I recommend it, however you have to approach it with a blank slate of a mind. <br />The series is based on the book and some of the characters in it, but there are a lot of big differences (Magda is not Miranda's cleaning lady in the book) <br />The book is a nice way to see where the show got its flavor, but basically it ends there.	2005-03-27

Unfortunately I missed the movie when it premiered on TV. However, I read the book and I loved it. It's such an incredible journey in a womans world.  <br />Janie, the main character in the book grows up poor with a grandmother who idolizes the white people she works for.

I saw the special on the Oprah show and read the article in the New York Times few years back and therefore wanted to see what the whole hype was about. <br />I found the book pretty intersting (maybe becuase I am dating a black man myself) and think that his reason for writing it is valid.  <br />There is a growing number of AA women who are being infected with HIV and if this book was written and surrounded in hype but helps at least one person avoid the horrible embarrassment and HIV then so much the better. <br />The book is quite intersting, although somewhat poorly written with undeveloped thoughts. I don't believe that the DL population he talks about is so prevalent, he made it seem like his whole town was full of black man sleeping with each other. <br />There are some interesting sub-stories about the men he interviewed and interacted with.  <br />He breaks down the type of men that might be on the DL, how they meet, and how they interact with each other. <br />Not the greatest book but information is interesting especially for someone nosy like me.	2004-09-26

The language, style of writing and the story absolutely took my breath away and definitely kept me interested until the very last page.<br /><br />The characters and the plot are so well developed that it was easy to follow andunderstand. The story is absolutey amazing, how one women's beauty and choices had an effect on so many people. Anna is an amazing character whose beauty almost radiates through the pages that it is described on.<br /><br />The love Anna has for her son, her lover, brother and others is incredible. Her love guides her actions and she often finds herself torn between her love for the people around her.<br /><br />Some other characters that are very amazing: Dolly and her constant struggle with herself about her husband, chidlren, and family affairs; Levin and his love for a woman who broke his heart; Kitty who after an embarrasing courting flop finds true love; Karenin, and his constant worry about how his actions look in front of God, and society; Oblonsky and his love of having a good time; and of course Vronsky whose lust and love change the lives of many.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, with a wonderful story about love, pride, family, and one's own torment about the decisions made in everyday life.<br /><br />This version of Anna Karenina has very helpful endnotes that help explain some of the politics, religion, and life during that time in russia.	2004-09-26

The author captures vividly the torment that rape victims go through with family, school, friends and sex life. Alice was brave and spoke up about her rape and was convinced to do everything she could to get the assailant.  <br />I recommend the book to everyone, especially those that know someone who has been raped.

However, it seems like the ending was cut a little short. The whole story unfolds slowly and then the ending seems like it was written in one hour and only takes a page and a half to explain what happens to Daniel.<br />I recommend this book, however if you do not like endings cut short you might want to steer clear of this one.	2004-06-01

It takes you on a spiritual journey and lets you freely question your own religion. You might be offended by some of the comments the author makes about Christianity, Muslims etc. but I think that is the whole beauty of it. <BR>The story of Pi is Amazing and unbelievable. A young man whose family was leaving their home in search for a better life is stranded in a life boat with very interesting companions. <BR>I absolutely loved the ending of this book, it made me look at the whole book and story from a totally different perspective.	2004-01-05

Wally's portrayal of a young woman is right on the money. This book succed me in and I found myself staying up til 3 am reading it. The story of Dolores is very moving with her parents separating, her mom going crazy, Dolores being ridiculed for her weight at almost 300 lb... So many different things happening to the main character... Great book cannot wait for the authors next novel.	2003-06-21
