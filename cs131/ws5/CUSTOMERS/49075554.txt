US	49075554	RV2QXLSIPZB3Z	0316154059	817062475	City of Bones	Books	3	3	4	N	N	bosched again	Not the strongest of the Harry Bosch series, but a good read nonetheless. One can't help liking the Harry Bosch character, taciturn but driven, and very fallible in his personal life. Once again the personal and the professional clash in Bosch's life. Strange that he can remain so detached and perceptive in his detective work, but such a disaster in his personal dealings. An interesting murder over 20 years old is the center of this story and Bosch has his eyes only on solving it, no matter the cost.	2002-04-25

Well written book advocating dietary chage away from carbohydrate rich foods to a more balenced protein dominent diet. I enjoyed reading it, and followed it for a while, but sadly lapsed.... Not enough recipes to keep me going, and very americanised, as i found difficulty in obtaining some of the ingrediants. Interesting concepts though!	2002-04-20

It is as interactive as a book can be, setting exercises to supplement the theory involved. It doesn't allow the reader to become bored with the language of wine, rather it explains it in a non-patronising manner. Will be a constant reference book for me.	2001-12-21

Real life stories can be amazing, and fill you full of envy, delight, fear. However, this book is so understated that although the writer did some courageous and amazing things, risking her life daily, she does not portray this, and leaves the reader dissatisfied. Sometimes modesty is not such a virtue.	2001-12-21

It compliments &quot;the beers of Wallonia&quot; and Michael Jackson's books on Beer. Gives a more detailed description of beers and where to find them than Jackson does, but sits well with &quot;the beers of Wallonia&quot; in that it tells you where to find the brews, and rates them accordingly, giving descriptions along the way. Well worth buying.	2001-10-11

Wallonia's beers and culture have lain hidden for centuries under the weight of their flemish and french equivalents. The Walloons have enjoyed their anonymity. But no longer! The authors traversed the french speaking half of Belgium and have uncovered a vast wealth of liquid gold....and reds, blonds and wheat coloured beers. Their enthusiasm for their task knew no bounds as they tracked down small family run brasseries in out of the way places that would do justice to the beerhunter himself, Michael Jackson. They have rated the beers using scales of their own tastes, as well as expectation for the tastes of others.Their descriptions of small unique breweries such as l'vapeur were captivating.One developed a severe thirst as one read. The book itself is not a coffee table exhibit as those from Mr. Jackson, but well worth the read, and one which I will bring to Belgium on my next trip there.	2001-09-06

He details in the book the means taken by some cyclists to climb out of the shadows into the sunshine by taking drugs. His book was brave at the time, he was accused of 'spitting in the soup' and lost the friendship of many of his cycling peers for his writing about the drug taking. He was called a liar. But time has revealed through the 'festina affair' who were the liars. A good read, but leaves one feeling a little sad to think that sport in general, not just cycling, can be so diseased.	2001-09-06

Gilbert gives highlights of the interactions between himself and the accused, and observations of the interactions among the accused, as well as highlights of the trial. I felt Gilbert let himself down by falling under the spell, as so many others did, of Speer.He doesn't delve deeply enough into the reasons for Speer's about face on nazism. Rather he takes it as face value, while at the same time portraying others for their weakness, vanity, and evil natures. I expected a more clinical look at these monsters rather than the brief outline of the personality tests undertaken. Also Gilbert had access to other war criminal not required for the main trial, but failed to draw comparisons with those 'lower down the order' in a hierarchy of 'i was only following orders'. However, the book is an insight into the trial on, dare I say it, a human level, for that, it is a valuable work.	2001-06-09

Details recipes from all over Belgium, dividing them on a regional basis. No pictures, but the recipes themselves speak volumes. There are quite a few recipes using game which may not appeal to everyone. This is a more complete look at Belgian cuisine rather than the very good 'Everyone eats well in Belgium', which concerns itself with Flemish cuisine.I would definately recommend this cookbook.	2001-06-09

Mason gives you a feel for flying as he takes you through how to fly a chopper with the aide of excellent diagrams, which i referred back to nearly all through the book. The real interest is in his descriptions of flying in combat, whether evacuating wounded or flying into 'hot zones'. It brings you into the action as much as any book can. This is not comic book fiction. This is a man's story of his war, and what a war it was!!!	2001-05-28

Wonderful book detailing the continued rise and rise of Gaius Julius Caesar, who comes across as a type of Machiavelli at times, and at other times a 'teflon don'of ancient Rome.

Gibbon drew on historical research to write about Rome. Shirer was there on the spot to write about Nazi Germany. This history details why Germany was susceptible to the rise of the nazis, and their subsequent rise to power, their trampling of all opposition, and the inevitable road to war. A fantastic read for someone who wants to know why the second world war happened.	2001-05-22

Unlike the others, there is less emphasis on central characters, and more on the situation at large. Surprising lack of emphasis on Pompey the Great as there was on Sulla and Marius in the previous books. The book is almost a play on the ancient chinese curse, 'may you live in interesting times' as the fall of Sulla, the rise of Pompey, the slaves revolt, and various foreign calamities take place.Well worth a read.	2001-05-22

This is a less famous episode than the Octavian-Anthony war, but just as important, as it laid the ground for the appointment of a dictator which eventually evolved into the position of emperor, and also Caesars death. Not as well written or as clear as Caesars commentaries from Gaul, but give a clearer insight into the divisions in Roman politics, as others are thought to have contributed to the writings.

Having read other biographies of Napoleon, and having just driven over the col de Saint Bernard, I was really looking forward to this book. The details are almost all there, but coloured with such a jaundiced view that the great man has been dragged down. Schom concentrates on the gory, the downsides, neglecting the triumphs and genuine achievements or casting such a doubt on them you begin to wonder why other authors have made such a fuss. He presents Napoleon as a Himmler or Hitler rather than a Patton or Caesar. I have rarely read a biography which was so negative towards it's principal.	2001-05-08

A man who 'conned' the war crimes commission at Nuremberg, and continued to do so to the rest of the world after the war. Why did his deputy hang and not he? A complex answer despite the evidence.
