It's rather like going to a movie like \\"My Dinner with Andre\\", in which the author sets up ideas with scenarios, and then allows the ideas to subtly hover. <br /> <br />I'm not saying that I found everything in \\"Each Mind a Kingdom\\" to be a plethora of positions with which I agreed. Indeed, in many cases, I felt that Dr. Satter over-eggs the pudding, and draws conclusions beyond her citations, and, in some cases, dismisses as \\"ambiguous\\" or \\"unclear\\" those authorities which do not fit her premise.  I found the omission of Elizabeth Delvine King's work, whose \\"purity new thought\\" ideas would not fit the author's \\"chronology\\" of the rise and fall of the \\"purity\\" movement, to be puzzling, and the near-dismissal of the Unity School and Religious Science to be curious in light of the far greater mainstream impact each movement had upon the culture than many of the people whom the author covers in detail. <br /> <br />Still, this book merits reading because it is a narrative voice making important points from fascinating subject matter. She introduced me to thinkers with whose work I was less familiar. More importantly, she tackles the gender rhetoric of early New Thought writings, particularly that by women, and examines the impact of the competing ways of looking at things on the broad culture. <br /> <br />Dr. Satter has three to five books of material in this work, and it is in some senses a shame that she tries to do so much. <br />Her conclusory points about Freud and modern self-help,each interesting, appear to be \\"toss ins\\"to try to \\"add relevance\\" to a work which needs no such effort. <br /> <br />But this is a fundamentally satisfying work, even though it is not free of flaws, because it has a rich sweep of ideas and characters better suited to a wonderful set of novels than to a single tome about gender imagery in New Thought. One might wish (as I do) that Dr. Satter adopted a style a little less quick to jump to conclusions and a little more willing to consider the rhetorical and metaphoric value of gender terminology (rather than the more mechanical, if fascinating,angle she takes). <br />But nonetheless, the work simply fascinates--it's a good read, with many troubling and promising lines of analysis. <br /> <br />Dr. Satter's explorations all prove quite interesting, and well worth reading, although some of her conclusions are notions with which I could not disagree more. This is perhaps a mark of a good book, though--you can dissent from the author's point of view, and yet still like the work. <br /> <br />I encourage anyone who wishes to understand the turn of the 20th Century to read this work, which offers ideas which will be both controversial, sometimes perhaps even unacceptable, but always fascinating. Well done. I wish that every dissertation read so well. <br /> <br />  <br />	2004-12-01

The Charles Street Meeting House proved to be a bold and controversial experiment in the universalist church. The church funded formation of a congregation in Boston. More importantly, the advocates for this church sought to create a church based on liberal humanism rather than on the prevailing protestant unitarianism in the local liberal churches. <br /> <br />The centerpiece of this book is inevitably the puzzling and powerful figure of Kenneth Patton. A poet and minister responsible for song lyrics of many U/U hymans, as well as material bits of liturgy, Patton saw himself as less a traditional minister than as a proponent of \\"one world religion\\" based on humanism. Patton saw his work as liberating the church from the ideas of many of its other practitioners, putting himself on the fine line between his own calls for tolerance and his somewhat intolerant attitudes to what he considered the foibles of others. The inclusion of Patton's sermon comparing Unitarian and Universalist ministers of more traditional faith to prostitutes poses the dilemma for the reader well. <br /> <br />It's a tribute to Ms. Cleary that her approach shows us many facets of this jewel. Although she does not disguise that she is a sympathizer with Patton's views, she does not stint on providing the details and facts on the failures of the church and on Patton's own idiosyncratic semi-curmudgeonliness. This book is told as it should be, through essays, personal experiences, and excerpts from Patton's essays and sermons. I might have suggested that more work written by those fundamentally less in sympathy with Patton's ideas might have helped this volume, but the work nonetheless is not propaganda, but a snapshot of a moment in time. Given this rich subject matter, it would have been tempting to tell this as back-row-pew gossip, but Cleary has a clear-eyed focus on giving the reader a feel for this experiment in liberal universalism. <br /> <br />Patton's challenges to the churches of his time were real and palpable--he posits, over and over, that elimination of dross is a key to finding a path through religion. Patton's call for social justice and for tolerance remain fresh and in need of attaiment today. The subplot about Clinton Lee Scott, who sought to found the church to advance his vision, but drew a mixed bag of great and puzzling in Mr. Patton, is quite interesting. <br /> <br />Some essays frankly prove troubling. Peter Lee Scott's essay expresses shock at other ministers circulating Patton's sermon copies to show their discomfort with his message. I think it is important for people of faith to be able to have an open dialogue, notwithstanding Scott's suggestion to the contrary. <br /> <br />But the point is that in a simple non-fiction book about an iconoclastic and influential fellow and his church setting, Cleary provides much food for thought and many ideas. For all his curious ways, Patton comes across quite favorably, which Cleary certainly intended. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful, surprisingly engaging book. I highly recommend.	2004-11-06

She took the personal defeat of a failed marriage in middle age, and transmuted it into the triumph of becoming a respected New Thought practitioner. Ms. Shinn's books are gathered here in one umbrella, in a good presentation with useful biographical material. <br /> <br />The books themselves contain all the virtues and troubling aspects of new thought prosperity writings. Ms. Shinn has a plain, anecdotal style which points out to her readers the benefits of a positive attitude and a belief that such an approach can change not only oneself, but reality itself. At the same time, the anecdotes she tells have a willingness to move into \\"I needed one hundred dollars, and it appeared through the power of my thoughts\\" aspect to them. The implied suggestion of thought as a mere get-rich-quick scheme, though undoubtedly not what the author intends to convey, nonetheless comes out as the \\"come on\\" for the work. <br /> <br />I found Ms. Shinn's books quite interesting reading, because she clearly approaches things from a practical, hands-on \\"practitioner's\\" view. She's clearly conversant with New Thought theory, but her goal is not to impart theory. Her goal is to explain in intelligent but simple terms the way she believes life to work. Despite its flaws, I found this a good set of reads, and an educational bridge into how New Thought worked in an era which is the transitional time between its founders and today. This is an important bit of documentation, and the publisher is to be commended for bringing it out.	2004-10-17

Ms. Moore does the things that regional novels of setting do--she makes the location a character in the novel, and she sets out to show how place defines culture. But unlike other novels of this type, she eschews overindulgence in the twee or the hard-bitten. Her narrative skills tend to be understated rather than bombastic,and her characters live in a world which, though not quite \\"real\\", feels like more than a picture-postcard from imaginary \\"lost charming town\\" or a rough tale of provincial hardship. <br /> <br />\\"Speak to the Winds\\" shows how a place comes to be, and comes to end. Moore's pace is deliberate rather than jaunty, but the book is rarely boring. Sometimes the hardship inherent in some of the more lonely lives stands out, but Moore does not milk this story for pat \\"social ccommentary\\" or \\"heart-breaking story\\". The tone is light but not annoying. The narrator's \\"voice\\" is audible but not stifling. <br /> <br />\\"Speak to the Winds\\" is the kind of old-fashioned read that began to disappear as surely as the accomplished mid-list novelist began to disappear. It's a popular book with literary style. It's worth reading. <br /> <br />	2004-10-13

He's a saint well-known in the popular vernacular--the humble friar in sackcloth with a penchant for caring for animals. The \\"real\\" Francis gets written about by numerous biographers. But Spoto's <br />treatment nonetheless stands out as a worthy read. <br /> <br />This book explains the main events, context and ideas of Francis' life and ministry. Spoto, a theologian by training, employs a narrative voice which is anything but Hemingwayesque, <br />as he tries to set up the setting for both the historical and theological context for Francis.  The result is a literate, relatively brief, and fascinating good read. <br /> <br />The Francis who emerges is, not surprisingly, a more complex character than the garden-gnome St. Francis of the vernacular. <br />Spoto uses a light touch to set forth not only Francis' triumphs and innovations, but also his many frustrations and asynchronies. <br /> <br />What becomes of a rebel who is determined to cause revolution within a faith not entirely ready for him? This biography raises and addresses this question, without quite answering it. <br /> <br />Sometimes the narrative commentary distracts a bit, but overall, the narrative voice is a welcome companion. I was disappointed that Spoto rushes to put an \\"orthodox\\" face upon the universality of Francis' last songs. Spoto seems to be shadow-boxing with prior writers, without quite showing us the wayang play in progress. <br /> <br />But Spoto wisely recognizes that Francis is best treated as one who led by example, not complex doctrine. He also appreciates that Francis' life is not only extraordinary, but also adventurous and many-faceted. His Francis is no dry virtuous saint, but a living, eccentric man who pointed out a new way to live. <br /> <br />Can anyone live the truly virtuous life? This is what Francis' story asks of religious person and the irreligious alike. Although this book is written by an apologist, it's not amere work of Christian apology disguised as a biography.  <br /> <br />Nobody knows, really, quite who Francis was. But this life tells a lot about what western religious culture aspires to be. This is a good treatment of a fascinating life, well worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-05

Robinson sets forth a short volume to explain in detailed but non-obscure terms the tenets of his form of liberal Christianity. He sets out to take the ideas of 20th Century theologians, and explain them in an accessible but not patronizing tone. In so doing, he manages to avoid the pitfall of many works of modern theology, in that Robinson writes a book about faith for people of faith and people without faith, rather than a mere academic exercise for other theologians. <br /> <br />In its day, Honest to God was considered quite controversial, as Robinson directly addressed his view of the non-literal nature of the Bible, his interpretation of the supernatural aspects of the Christian faith, and a muted but not hidden view that social mores have evolved from the days of earliest Christianity. <br /> <br />Although the book is now decades old, the book arguably deserves readers more today than it did upon its release in an era of liberal Christian works. Robinson does not shy from the complexities of modern theologians, but he uses the direct, workable language of the popular religious writer to show the reader that \\"liberal Christianity\\" is not merely a set of complex theories and redefinitions, but instead a real-world attempt to make sense of both the legacy of faith and the evolution of thinking brought on by science. <br /> <br />If you've always associated Christianity with the charismatic theology of televangelists, this book is an excellent read to understand a different, vital form of the faith. Although Robinson in his day Robinson attracted critics and controversy, this book is nothing more (nor less) than a short, good read about a way of experiencing the Christian faith. This was a watershed work of popular theology when it first appeared, and remains important today, when people mistake \\"liberal religion\\" for \\"liberal politics\\" and imagine that theologians are all trapped in the ivory tower. <br /> <br />Honest to God is a simple, good read, about ultimate things. It may not \\"convert\\" you, but its refreshing candor makes it worth the read.	2004-10-02

She expands her contrast to include a goodish number of Britons. Her third-person narrative centers around the  <br />doings when a rich man and his young wife have a ski accident. <br />We are led through the viewpoints and lives of the man's children, as well as a newly-rich-in-dot-coms young California woman.  <br /> <br />The comparison inevitable in reviewing this novel is that to Johnson's other cultural comedy, Le Divorce. Although L'Affaire has similarities sufficient to draw the reader who liked Le Divorce, this comedy of manners is rather different as well. Ms. Johnson's periscope view of people of some money and some culture provides a bit wider view here.  <br /> <br />The world created by this novel is not intended to be quite the literal world in which we all live. Like a Wodehouse novel, the Johnson universe has some touchstones from \\"real life\\", but is instead its own constructed universe. Although Le Divorce arguably had some \\"skewed Jane Austen\\" touches, this novel is more Trollopeian in its approach. Although all characters are quite sympathetic, none are quite lovable. <br /> <br />This book is consistently diverting, and in parts quite amusing. <br />It rarely provides the \\"roar out loud\\" type of chuckle, but that's more a matter of design than flaw.Ms. Johnson's ear for language remains solid. L'Affaire is a quick interlude more than a lifelong memory, but well worth reading.	2004-10-01

Although the work contains many themes present in earlier histories of this era, the author's combination of intriguing \\"bird's eye\\" anecdote with play-by-play strategic analysis holds the reader's attention. Some of the \\"stock debates\\" from this time period are presented once more--the British/American leadership tension, the preparedness/unpreparedness of the American military for a world war and the curious personalities, from Patton to Montgomery. <br /> <br />Yet the work does not feel like a rehash of other war stories. <br />Atkinson wisely realizes that he must do more than reach conclusions about the war--he must go further and give the reader a sense of place and time. <br /> <br />This book is a narrative entertainment rather than rigorous history, but for all that, it is sufficiently detailed and sufficiently interesting for either buff or novice. The book is both an easy read and intellectually satisfying--the type of non-fiction all too rare, particularly in this prolific genre. <br /> <br />I recommend this as a jaunty read about the onset of a tremendous war.

Ben Fong Torres takes a different tack in this autobiography, telling us about two disparate worlds. One is the world of being the child of Chinese immigrants, living without a great deal of money. The other is the story of a man who seemed born to be a journalist, coming of age in 1960s San Francisco.  <br /> <br />Many novels chronicle the Asian American experience in California with a magical realism. The author instead uses a conversational, simple style.  <br /> <br />The book is not free from flaws. One section of the book tries to communicate the 60s \\"free love\\" experience, but comes off a bit like \\"hippie chicks I've conquered\\". It's as though the social failure from high school must show his belated prowess even after all these years. But it's a quibble, overall. <br /> <br />But overall, this book feels more \\"real\\" than many more \\"visionary\\" works. Mr. Fong Torres' description of how a family tragedy indirectly helps him connect the disparate pieces of his bicultural world really works well.  <br /> <br />I thought this book would be flamboyant. It is anything but. It's a simple, solid read by a good writer. It's worth taking in. <br /> <br />	2004-09-25

The format is quite simple. Arthur sets forth the historical context of the feud. He recounts many of the \\"shots fired\\". Then he offers a brief reappraisal of the feud, and its impact on its participants. <br /> <br />The feuds are well-known--Twain/Harte, Hemingway/Stein, the \\"Two Cultures\\" debate, McCarthy/Hellman, and other similar literary disagreements. Arthur's style is light without being breezy, informative without being didactic. His critical evaluations are reasonably measured, and interesting rather than annoying or heavy-handed. <br /> <br />This is a fun read. It's serious enough to point up the issues, and in particular the similarities as well as the differences in the feud participants. But it's got a straightforward tone, as the author seeks to entertain rather than to preach. All in all, a very good book.	2004-09-25

Rather than committing the travel book era of using factual trivia to make the book more weighty, he uses allusions and background explanation as a way so that his life in the places he visits has a context and an imaginative quality. This book, Nearer My Dog to Thee, finds Mr. MacKintosh an older, but no less idealistic and whimsical,<BR>traveller, now over 50. The &quot;plot&quot; of the story is quite simple.<BR>Graham takes a pound pet from Rosarito to a remote Baja national park forest, for a Summer of camping. Mackintosh's non-fiction has a story-telling quality which makes the trip much less important than the travel. <br />So many travel book authors spend too much time trying to impress the reader with erudition or descriptions of the awe-inspiring or absurd. MacKintosh here merely lets a story flow, about a trip not many of us have taken, but we all wish and think we could. That may be the beauty of his writing--this is not &quot;trip as impossible journey&quot;, but &quot;the natural world as accessible to all&quot;.<br />I have a few minor quibbles with the book. Sometimes he refers to traits as &quot;Mexican&quot;, when the traits are more properly the traits of some people he meets in Mexico. That's not to say that he's exhibiting any disturbing bias--he clearly is deeply fond of the Mexicans he meets. Rather, it's a narrative shorthand device I find imperfect. <br />Still, I give this book the highest recommendation. I'd read each of his other books, and thought them grand.But this more mature man exhibits a more mature writing style in this work.He still has the boyish enthusiasm, but it's now admixed with an integrated, mature perspective. I won't quite say that the &quot;old Baja hand&quot; is becoming old, because this one is refreshing and new. But I will say there's a richness here that really inspires.<br />It's hard to describe a MacKintosh book to the novice, because the combination of down-to-earth first person narrative and interesting historical detail is so deftly done. His narratives are friendly, in the way James Herriott short stories were amiable. But he casts his net quite widely--after matters of the heart and spirit, admissions of personal shortcoming, and sheer reverie at the joy of being alive.<br />I read Graham Mackintosh because while taking me to the middle of nowhere, he makes me nod and say &quot;yes, I relate to that&quot;. I'll take that over any number of avalanche deaths and murderous seas in my travel reading. He's the travel writer for people who really prefer amusing, friendly novels.	2004-02-28

This &quot;language of poetry review&quot;, well hackneyed, renders a meaningful review of a skillful book about loss and lack difficult to write. Lisa Haynes' &quot;Ex-Lovers and other More Important Losses&quot; addresses a wide range of themes and emotions, grouped in related sets of poems. Whether she writes about a police pursuit, a fading relative, life on a native American reservation, or love relationships, she brings to each poem a wonderful ear, and a way of drawing vivid imagery in straightforward language. Her work lacks the pretension that give some works a &quot;poetry workshop&quot; quality, but neither does she try to write a &quot;know nothing&quot; feel-good &quot;emotion of the week&quot; type of poetry. She brings a sure sense of how to write poetry to a set of ideas worthy of a poet's voice.<br />The works here largely are written in free verse, although she does play with other formats in some effective ways. Although the poems are entirely contemporary, they have a timeless quality about them, a sort of well-formed stateliness. The poet does not mince words here, but neither does she fail to appreciate their power. Instead of elaborately constructed rocketships incapable of ascending Heaven, she builds instead more earthbound and serviceable pieces, capable of transporting.<br />This is a book for people who like their poems straightforward, real, and yet filled with satisfying imagery. Lisa Haynes has done a good thing here, and I hope more people will discover her work.	2003-11-11

Byatt's &quot;Possession&quot; intends to be an entertainment with both wit and bite. Although it features many of the conventions that make other novels predictable--the &quot;historical story within the story&quot; conceit, the &quot;foibles of modernity and of modern academics&quot; riffs, and the &quot;social message in social context&quot; challenges, the book quite simply is an old-fashioned good read.<br />The plot revolves around the discovery of materials which hint at a relationship between two 19th C. poets. Elements of mystery and suspense genre fiction pop in and out, with the author conscious of and constantly referring to her influences.<BR>The satiric sections take on generally easy targets (literati collectors, American provincial university acquisitiveness), but the tone is so breezy it causes no offense. The natural comparison has been to Umberto Eco's work, because this work seeks to drop one into a dense set of ideas, without explaining all the contexts of each. Some will see this as a Wodehouse or Waugh type farce. Some will see this as feminist parable. Some will see this as densely layered historical fiction.<br />I see this as a simply solid entertainment. Those who find themselves bored with literature about literature will be bored here. Those who find themselves in search of work which is relentlessly profound should stray elsewhere. Those who do not wish novels to contain both rough and smooth are best suited in works of lighter comedy or deeper despair.<br />But those who want to take a keen wit, and give her a literary kaleidoscope, and see what will happen--read this. Byatt is arguably not for everyone, but she is certainly right for me.	2003-10-30

These are \\"big\\", heady themes, but the writing here is strong,and the story is a simple, old-fashioned \\"good read\\". The protagonist, Mattie, is anything but a poster child for sainthood. Recently divorced, dealing with a troubled past and an unsettling present,<BR>her story is very \\"down to earth\\", a rambling set of small adventures and family mysteries which tell rather like an afternoon in a small town engaged in \\"visitin'\\". Ms. LaMott, though, is a gifted writer, whose sure wit and deft ability to weave metaphor and symbol into a family narrative succeeds here far more often than it fails to excite. Ms. Lamott pursues spiritual themes, and in some ways the symbolism reminds one of very different novels, such as \\"The End of the Affair\\" or even \\"Brideshead Revisited\\", but Ms. Lamott's vision recognizes all the dilemmae of faith while steadfastly refusing to develop \\"tidy\\" resolutions which eliminate all the ambiguity. <br />So many times today, stories about the Christian virtues and resistance to vice are easy, \\"G-rated\\" affairs in which the good come to realize the error of their ways, and their lives redeem into suburban bliss instantly. Ms. Lamott's characters solve mysteries, sort out tragedy and find ways to live with themselves. But they do not transform into saints from being sinners, and Ms. Lamott squarely addresses the moral ambiguities which affect this story of people hunting for ways to live a meaningful life. Although Ms. Lamott writes from an explicitly Christian perspective, this is not some work of theology or conversion set piece. To the extent she touches on theological themes, she will frankly dissatisfy many Christians and intrigue those without faith. I think this novel is best read not as the dreaded \\"Christian novel\\", but as a novel by an author who happens to be Christian. God seems indeed to be an unseen character as to some of the plot developments, but this is anything but some tract for the perfect life. No altar calls sound out, no heavenly choirs sing.<br />I think this is a book to read for many reasons, but one in particular appeals to me. This is a book which without undue moralizing sets out in stark tones how important realization of family flaws can be, and how much damage can be transmitted down generations by \\"the sins of the father\\". Ms. Lamott uses a combination of literary writing, easily accessible 'magazine fiction' and a light sense of mystery to tell a worthwhile tale.<BR>I must admit that before I read this novel, Ms. Lamott's non-fiction had never captured me--she seemed a bit too NPR-perfect in her witty repartee about her spirituality among her imperfections. This novel suggests she understands the difficult tightrope her ideas try to walk, and though it arguably tries to do too much, it is still a quiet, worthwhile must read. Even if one dislikes \\"Christian writers\\", family soap opera, and protagonist-as-dysfunctional-divorcee-coming-of-belated-age novels, this novel is not to be missed.	2003-09-20

On the one hand, the setting and atmosphere create an alien world one visits, which becomes as familiar as our own. On the other hand, the plot discloses a story which works even if the sci fi trappings did not envelop the story. Terenesia works on both levels. Set in the near future, Terenesia explores an explosion of genetic diversity, seemingly overnight, in a remote area near Indonesia.<BR>The plot device through which the story is told arises from a brother and sister who grew up the children of the first researchers of the phenemenon, but who, for reasons best left to be discovered upon reading, revisit the island years later.<br />The science here is solid-feeling, but the writing is so solid that the plausibility evidenced here is less a matter of deduction than of wonderful narrative. This book neither preaches nor \\"geeks\\" too much. It's simply a well-told tale, modern and yet alien, well worth the read.	2003-08-03

Books	5	11	11	N	N	A book I'd read any Saturday!	&quot;Do You Know what I'm Going to Do Next Saturday?&quot; fueled my own childhood hopes and dreams. The narrator, a pre-teen boy, describes all the incredible plans and schemes he intends to fulfill on Saturday. Each plan, more ambitious than the first, gets a photo illustration which suggests, just slightly, what the wish fulfillment could be, if only it could be. This book is a wonderful metaphor for the shining notion of &quot;Saturday as liberation&quot;,  a perfect capture of that sense of anticipation that after 43 years on this earth, I still bring to each Friday.<BR>I love this book, because it's simple, direct, and yet keys into fantasies about &quot;exciting weekends&quot; I have had all my life. A sweet, earnest, goofy, fun book.	2003-05-31

Some seek to portray the &quot;revolutionary&quot; nature of the poet's ideas. Others get lost in craft or in the needless pedantry concerning schools of poetics. Jane Hirshfield instead presents the coherent well-written prose of a synthesist.  The result provides an effective rumination upon the &quot;mind&quot; (or &quot;spirit&quot;) of poetry.<br />Ms. Hirshfield uses literary and religious allusion freely, but this is no glib new age-ish miracle cure about the artist's &quot;mystic journey&quot;. Instead, she uses the symbols of faith and skepticism as a rich metaphoric base to try to explore the goal and inner working of the effort to write a poem.<br />This work does not pretend to be some Quran of poetics, complete unto itself or changeless. Instead, the author surveys her task like a visitor to the crater of diamonds park, hunting for something shining among the crystal.<br />What I like about this book is that for all its rich allusion and reflections on symbolism, it's an accesible, affirming and non-saccharine take on why we are poets, and what it means to us.<br />My only quibble with her work is that the influence of eastern thought on the western American poets comes through much more clearly than the effect of the American experience on these same poets.In the poetry I read, Sandburg, Millay, and Forche spring from very different places with radically different voices, and yet each has an &quot;American&quot; tone that is unmistakable. It's not a matter of &quot;nationalism&quot; per se, but a matter of history and the lasting impression of the American experience. It's not a fault of the book at all, but a perspective I missed. <br />I think this is a great book to own for anyone who has pondered the &quot;big questions&quot; of poetry--what does it mean? why do I write?<BR>In the abstract, an essay on poetic philosophy sounds filled with dull pretension.  This book is anything but dull.	2003-05-18
US	51985044	RI2J4HV7LTMYP	1580420257	393492283	Official Rules of Chess	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Curious and yet interesting	The United States Chess Federation (USCF) publishes an &quot;Official Rules of Chess&quot; which is more generally thought of as &quot;the&quot; official US tournament rules.  I wondered, therefore, whether publication of &quot;another&quot; set of &quot;official rules&quot; made any sense, other than as a marketing ploy. This book, though, proposes a workable set of rules for play.  The authors take a small swipe at a flaw or two in the USCF rules, which swipe seems to me largely unnecessary. The authors do make the useful observation that most chess is not played under USCF auspices.  However, most US &quot;live&quot; rated chess probably is, which this book obscures.  But if the title &quot;Official Rules of Chess&quot; is a bit strong, given that the USCF &quot;official rules&quot; are probably used for more over-the-board rated games, the book is nonetheless an enjoyable read.  I suppose I wish that the title were &quot;Rules of Chess--a Proposal&quot;, but even that title would not quite work, as this set of rules is in use for at least one scholastic chess league.  <br />Why should one buy this book when it is not a &quot;USCF&quot; official rules book?  Perhaps because it's got good sections on chess etiquette, good suggestions for rule variations, and an easy, free flowing style.  Mr. Schiller's smooth style remains quite readable.<br />I docked this book a star because of its title &quot;Official Rules&quot;.<BR>But I found it a fascinating read, nonetheless.  It's a good buy for those interested in chess possibilities, but perhaps a less essential buy for those literally hunting US &quot;official rules&quot;, who would do much better by buying the USCF official rules.	2003-04-30

In this time when everyone has a &quot;magic formula&quot; or &quot;secret test&quot; to suddenly solve all the challenges in our school, it's a pleasure to read this book, which takes on the question 'what makes a good teacher?' one teacher at a time.  The striking thing about the teachers here is what a diverse set of circumstances and personalities are found among the educators profiled.  The author skilfully shows us that the common threads are not identical personalities or approaches, but rather the more straightforward values of diligence and compassion.  The book is an extremely easy and entertaining read.  If you've wanted to understand teaching from the perspective of &quot;who makes it work?&quot; rather than the more familiar &quot;everything's wrong&quot;, this is an excellent place to start.	2002-10-14
US	51985044	R162SYALNLWEBJ	0886779995	613947698	In the Company of Others	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Solid one volume slice of the future	In the Company of Others is a character-driven future history novel in which the drive for space terraforming and colonization is ruined by a particularly interesting ecological mistake by the early terraformers.  The sense that the &quot;adversary&quot; is not some set of bug-eyed aliens, but instead a mistaken spread of a species by the humans themselves, is a very appealing plot device. The characterization is overall very good.  The narration is in third person, and all but one of the central relationships is believable.  There are a few &quot;stock&quot; 'spacer maverick' and 'loyal soldier' type characters, and the central love story in the work seems to arise from fairly whole cloth. Still, these flaws are overshadowed by the fact that In the Company of Others uses its central dilemma as a workable platform to make points about the problems of communication and interconnection.  So many times science fiction seems to be caught between trite and trivial emotional content and some contrived &quot;hard&quot; science.  In the Company of Others manages to tell a whole working space opera in a single volume, without needless tech-obsession or undue maudlin content.  This is a worthwhile read, enjoyable as a golden age novel, but less imprisoned by the conventions of that time.	2002-09-24

His assemblage boxes of materials on topics ranging from rabbits to Lauren Bacall to the ornaments and symbols of childhood make for fascinating viewing.  Cornell is a curious personality.  On the one hand, he self-documented to a far greater extent than many artists, so that a relatively rich record of &quot;what the artist was thinking&quot; exists.  On the other hand, he lived his life in a reclusive, introspective, elusive way, so that the viewer never quite feels that s/he has &quot;gotten one's arms&quot; around his perspective.  <br />Lindsay Blair's &quot;Joseph's Cornell's Vision of Spiritual Order&quot; uses as its critical basis the foundations of Cornell's beliefs and influences, in an effort to help make the more elusive aspects of his work a bit clearer.  She writes excellent passages about the way in which Cornell was influenced by, but certainly not at all co-opted by, the surrealist artists.  She adroitly uses passages from Cornell's own writings, as well as analogies from his personal history, to provide cogent criticism which is less &quot;art critic projection&quot; and more a sincere, highly readable attempt to &quot;get into&quot; the mind of a man whose mind assiduously resisted such invasions.<br />Ms. Blair recognizes that Christian Science, Mr. Cornell's faith, has an impact on his work.  In this respect, her writing is less revelatory, as her summation of the new thought ideas of Christian Science are a bit reductive.  Mr. Cornell's work obviously has strong religious roots. Although Ms. Blair seems to have read up on some basic ideals of the faith, the passages in which she discusses Mr. Cornell's faith's influence on his work seem much less insightful than her discussion of the effects of other aspects of his personal life upon his work.  One wonders if Mr. Cornell had been from a more &quot;mainstream&quot; faith if the explicitly religious motivation for some of his work (as revealed in his own writings) might have gotten a more comprehensive and detailed treatment than Ms. Blair accords here.<BR>This is a very fine book, certainly one worth owing, but ironically, the reader is left wanting a bit more discussion of the actual &quot;vision of a spiritual order&quot; and perhaps a bit less traditional art criticism.<br />This book has wonderful photographs of Cornell's work, and functions well as criticism, as biography, and as a thought-provoking piece on Cornell's curious place in the art world.  If one is familiar with Cornell's work, this is a fascinating inroad further into its meaning.  If one is, as I am, less a hard-core Cornell devotee than one who has encountered his work relatively recently, this is a well-done introduction to his art and thinking.  The book is relatively free of that self-serving &quot;look how smart the critic is&quot; art talk that besieges so much of this genre.  Despite my quibbles about its &quot;flaws&quot;, I highly recommend this book.	2002-09-24

Tevis accomplishes the task by<BR>creating believable characters, biting satire, and a pacing that is both leisurely and consistently interesting.<br />We are in a time when humankind's pursuit of happiness has<BR>been reduced to the pursuit of pleasure.  Mechanical inventions have eliminated the need to read, to write or to work. <BR>The zero hour work week is imminent.  <br />Who happens to the soul when it is freed from the mind?<BR>Tevis answers the question brilliantly.  This book is<BR>a solid, strong read--it's a linear text, with little<BR>time wasted on metaphysical author's voice.  It uses quiet (if piercing) satire liberally, but not to the distraction of the plot.    Tevis shows us a future all too much like our present,<BR>only the trains have stopped running on time.  My only criticism is that we are shown all the &quot;no exit&quot; spots in this dysfunctional world, but too few of the ways of escape.<br />Highly recommended.  Anyone who thought Tevis' Man Who Fell to Earth was a bit difficult to follow will find this one <BR>a breeze and yet a very thought-provoking book.	2002-05-31

The strains of autobiography and the rich array of comic and tragicomic characters give the reader the best of Dickens' wit and social outrage.  As the years go by, though, people begin to speak of David Copperfield as a \\"set piece\\", a bit of Victoriana different in format but not in importance from a very natty<br />but a bit days-gone-by bit of antique furniture.  This view misjudges the novel.  This book presents a rich set of characters in a complex novel, deeply satisfying and in many ways still a very modern work.  It's very hard to write about \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" without descending into morality play, but this novel succeeds.  The story is broken into three<br />\\"threads\\": a young boy, orphaned early, endures an unhappy childhood refreshed by periods of happiness (and comedy);<br />that same boy goes through late adolescence, and comes \\"into his own\\"; and finally, the narrator, now a man, sees the resolution of the various plot threads built through the early parts of the novel.  Many Dickens themes are played out here--the superiority of goodness to affluence, the persistence and affrontery of fraud, and the way in which social institutions frequently hinder rather than advance their stated goals.  The book does not read like a polemic, though--it reads like a bit of serial fiction (which in fact it was).<br />If you are hunting a good, solid read about values and<br />curious characters, David Copperfield stands ready to show you his world.	2002-01-24

Man's first instinct is to sidestep condition and reap profit.  Man learns to love home, pet and new woman in his life.  This sounds like the plot of a Victorian play or a 40s B movie.  But Where You Are is instead a very fine novel, due to its subtle narrative and refined character development.  We come to understand our two protagonists in the silences rather than in what they say, and the &quot;romantic salvation&quot; of the male protagonist is not treachly, soapy, or forced.<BR>This is a textbook example in how to take tried and true themes and make them new with witty, simple writing.

She uses her song lyrics, poems and prose both recent and juvenile, and a centerpiece radio interview of Ms. Vega by Leonard Cohen (the most &quot;human&quot; part of the book, as Mr. Cohen alternates between simple friendliness, quick wit, deep insight and good, old-fashioned flirtatious play to &quot;illustrate&quot; Ms. Vega's contradictions and the themes of her music through a spirited dialogue).<br />As in her songs, Ms. Vega writes in veiled themes. She tries to illustrate that one can own the artist's revelations without owning (or needing to know) anything about the artist herself. She quotes passages to support her idea that her particular muse stems from childhood experience, and that she is merely saying the same things she thought at nine. She repeatedly makes the point that it is the elusive (and by inference, the allusive) that appeals to her. As Ms. Vega points out, the communication medium of a songwriter includes in large measure the lyrics of her songs. Yet this is not a mere fanzine piece, but instead a well-done arrangement which highlights her ideas without descending into morose autobio. Although her spare, dark sense of humor peeks through the covers a time or two here, the book perhaps suffers from yet another Vega trait--her consistent effort to maintain a sort of &quot;high seriousness&quot; about her proceedings. I would have liked, perhaps, to see the lyrics of Christine Lavin's Vega parody &quot;Mysterious Woman&quot; arrayed beside Ms. Vega's own lyrics. Ms. Vega shows the reader that she understands the limitations in the persona she created, but we do not quite see what persona she wishes we had seen instead.<BR>Still, I left this book convinced that Suzanne Vega remains a complex and interesting artist, wishing for fame, but disliking the toll it can take on the part of the artist which is not the public persona. Thank goodness this is not a morose &quot;pity me, I'm famous&quot; piece, but a set of images and wordplay, well worked out. Read this, even if you are not a &quot;Suzanne Vega fan&quot;.<br />I left this book feeling that I understood a thing or two about the public person Suzanne Vega seeks to portray, and that I need not know anything more about Suzanne Vega herself. I believe this is what Ms. Vega wants the reader to feel, and therefore she has succeeded admirably.	2001-10-31

Murdoch's work explores the historic origins of its social justice mission. His portrayal of the Booths, the husband and wife team who founded the Army, is largely sympathetic if sometimes critical. His thesis throughout this book, convincingly demonstrated, is that the Salvation Army's social work among the urban poor was not an outgrowth of successful evangelical work among these folks, but instead a substitute in light of a ministry that consistently succeeded among suburban English Methodists rather than those in the most impoverished parts of London. Murdoch creditably seeks to distance himself from the Salvation Army apologist biographers, yet a few of his own images--Ms. Booth preaching in the West End while Mr. Booth toils in the East End, seem a bit too literary (albeit sometimes the literary is also the true). Murdoch's treatment of the autocratic, nepotic nature of the early Salvation Army is not heavy-handed, and his appreciation of the Booths' desire to make a difference rather than merely form a denomination is well-portrayed. Throughout this work, the Salvation Army seems an interesting experiment in pure Wesleyanism, leading to unpredicted failures and unlooked for success. This book is a consistently interesting read about a people from a time which, though relatively recent, seems remote now.	2001-08-27

Macy's novel plays with the conventions of these earlier works, trying to recreate late 20th C. upscale NY, a world apparently peopled by conservative 20somethings with a late 1940s sensibility and old conflicts like old money v. social climbers.<br />What makes the work seem fresh despite its familiar subject matter is the way in which Ms. Macy renders the key dilemma of her protagonist, George, a headmaster's son educated among the rich but never one of them. <br />As is common in this type of novel, George has his nose pressed very hard against the shiny plate glass window of the Wealthy Life.  What makes him distinctive is that his longing for a prototypical Rich Girl is impeded not only by a difference in social class, but also by any similar emotion on the part of the woman he fancies.  Macy does a good job of illustrating the  power of purposeless longing, the way in which longing can induce a sort of myopia.  <br />The ending is a bit disappointing, but overall the work maintains a light, even tone even when the plot is no longer light.<br />This is a worthwhile read--no so much a new road as a nice journey down an established trail.	2001-08-20

The book is organized in essay format, with good flow between chapters.  Numerous diagrams make this an easy read.  As might be expected in a general work, some aspects of the work deserve a more complete treatment than they receive here.  This is a good read, and a worthwhile introduction.

US	51985044	R22X969IJD0HLD	0395735297	507464947	War As I Knew It	Books	4	8	10	N	N	Interesting snippet of history	The war/anti-war movie Patton some years ago gave us a storehouse of anecdotes and images about this larger-than-life character.  Some of the conventional biographies about Patton get lost in the many contradictions between his various public and private personae.  War as I Knew It, though falling in the time-hallowed military genre of &quot;leaving one's own record&quot;, presents a fascinating set of contradictions as poignant as any cinematic fantasy about Patton.  The work is quite short, and <br />tells a more or less chronological set of anecdotes about  the Italian and German campaigns, coupled with a set of observations on war generally.  The anecdotes are organized in almost despatch or diary-derived smatterings, while the  general observations of war are modeled on classical war instructive material from past times.  One is consistently surprised at how many &quot;colorful myths&quot; about Patton prove to have a basis in reality.  One is also consistently aware of how Patton's world view, biases and prejudices marked him as very much a man of his own era, rather than the noble warrior from the distant past he imagined himself to be.  The work contains a large amount of self-congratulation, but it can also tell  very heroic stories in fairly low key.  The liberation of Bastogne, during the Battle of the Bulge, is told in a fairly understated fashion.  Although in the text Patton owns up to only two flaws in his military campaigns, one significant, one very minor, one still has the idea that deep down he understood not only the advantages but also the drawbacks of the &quot;always attacking&quot; role in which he cast himself.   The racist remarks contained in portions of the book were reasonably tame in their time, but resonate very poorly today; Patton himself seems aware of the controversy, as he sometimes takes pains to couch his remarks with conciliatory statements about the bravery of those he denigrates.  The reader is not bogged down with military jargon in this book, but gets a real feel for Patton's gift of rapid mobilization of armored divisions.  Patton's sense of history and culture, though sometimes emphasized with a curious false modesty, are nonetheless quite notable.  <br />I came to this book feeling that Patton was a complex character, not easily understood.  Having read the work, I find him no less complex, no less disturbing, but even more mythical than the movie had led me to believe.  One does not leave this book liking the man better than before reading it, or really understanding the man, but the book is nonetheless an absorbing read about a curious character indeed.	2001-07-26

Mrs. 'Arris is an enchanting character in that her fundamental ordinary humanity and decency, rather than any superhuman virtue or penetrating insight, allows her to connect with those about her.  This is musical comedy fiction, gently told, well done.  All the Mrs. 'Arris books are splendid reads, and deserve at least a reissue, if not a film series.	2001-07-08

The tone is mock-boosterish, giving rise to some sly comic moments.  This is a wonderful parody of that  can-do mentality that seems to infect us in North America. The work anticipates Lake Woebegone by some years, but has a distinctly Canadian feel.  We've seen lots of works take mythical townspeople one by one, but I can think of few that do it as well and as simply as this one.  This is a must read.	2001-07-07

In Four Blondes, she tries to expand her repertoire, while sticking to the motifs that made Sex and the City so popular.  The format is simple-- four novellas, each about a woman drifting among New York's moneyed classes, each striving unashamedly to the gratification of a basic desire (the list runs to love, lust, financial comfort and a sense of self).   The works are heavily plotted (Wodehouse-ian, musical comedy plotted), and read like a cross between the early 20th C. late realist novelists (a bit too much has been made of the Edith Wharton connection, though both chronicle manners in upscale NY), 60s trash fiction like Jacqueline Susann or Harold Robbins, and the sense of illustration by amusing caricature of Armistead Maupin. Each  female lead character seems like an Ellen Gilchrist passionate heroine grasping for fulfillment. But all the literarey references are really a bit beside the point (indeed, one of the amusing ways in which Ms. Bushnell shows her own self-awareness is by having her own characters reflect on their reflection in two other &quot;similarities&quot;--the works of Bret Easton Ellis and the movie &quot;All About Eve&quot;).<br />I do not typically enjoy the &quot;god isn't my social clique interesting&quot; form of semi-autobio fiction.  Heaven knows that some of the particularly dreary assumptions about life without huge sums of money seem to be not only afflictions of the characters, but also of the author, which would ordinarily turn me off.   One can't help but miss in this book of virtues a few of the middle class virtues not displayed in great profusion by the folks portrayed here--humility and altruism come to mind.  But it's undeniable that Ms. Bushnell has worked her particular form of genre fiction into something that transcends the Valley of the Dolls influences that permeate her work.  Is this great literature?  Absolutely not.  Is this an entertainment? Absolutely.  This is not uproariously funny, though it has some witty bits.  Instead, this is a fluid read about odd people who, on reflection, may not be as odd as one initially thought.  I read an interview with Ms. Bushnell in which she termed &quot;pathetic&quot; a reviewer who had dared to term these women protagonists &quot;pathetic&quot;.  But, really, it appears to me that Ms. Bushnell shows not only the exuberance but also the thread of pathos in us all, and that's something the 60s trash novelists did not accomplish nearly so well.  This is a worthwhile read.	2001-07-04

The book is a jaunty, interesting run to a conclusion--a reminder that immature behavior by a young adult can have unforeseen consequences.  Many of the devices of Trollope's comic novels are here, but they subserve a plot which resolves in a decidedly non-comic fashion.  A light read, an interesting commentary, and a social frankness that does not seem at all old fashioned.  Trollope was not always an ardent critic of his own social order, but he understood the problems, as this book shows in a non-preachy way.	2001-06-10

The story was readable, but I thought that I was reading yet another &quot;southern boy writes about how odd his milieu is&quot; collection.  As the collection progressed, though, I came to see that Mr. Earley has a real talent for the story.  He hits themes which are pretty well travelled in short stories these days--&quot;accepting less in life, but wanting more&quot;, &quot;the things we say, the things we can't say&quot;, but his prose style is fresh, and his sense of a good story is impeccable.  Sometimes I feel that his plots try to &quot;touch the bases&quot; of a &quot;proper&quot; short story, when in fact he should just let his narrative genius flow.  This is a very worthwhile book to read, quite an entertainment.  Mr. Earley can write comic scenes, but this is no simplistic set of comic stories.  This is a set of good yarns by a modern storyteller.	2001-05-29

The author evokes through a series of character foils the conflicts between the 19th Century Irish Catholic milieu in which the characters  exist and the very real and human passions that they develop at odds with their circumstances.  The narrative voice is sympathetic, yet quick to point up the character flaws in each of the family members portrayed in this novel filled with misplaced passions and passionless near misses.  Although this is a short novel, it is not a quick read.  It instead is a patient, quiet, well-constructed but not particularly novel portrayal of the contrasts between life as we imagine it and life as it really is lived.  I recommend the Ante-Room, but it is not for the impatient or faint of heart.	2001-05-23

The novel's protagonist, who shares the author's name, leads the reader through a series of vignettes in which the protagonist's self-loathing and frustration is rivalled only by her deep-seated need to be famous. This work will please fans of Ms. Loh's journalistic and NPR efforts--the Buzz Magazine piece about Ms. Loh's wedding and the LA Weekly &quot;Against Writing&quot; piece (an interesting soliloquy on basically how nobody should want to be a writer, author excepted) are rendered here in only mildly altered form, thanks to the very modern plot device of the deus ex dot.comica.  The protagonist's &quot;artist's journey&quot;, between ambition and abrasiveness is documented in some detail, though the narrative voice, like that in Ford's Good Soldier, tells us a &quot;saddest story ever told&quot; we never quite trust or buy into.  Ms. Loh continues to be an intelligent and talented performer who can amuse in quick zingers, but whose work becomes tiring over time.   Fans will love this work, because it sticks to the tried and true Loh themes.  The rest of us will continue to wonder whether Ms. Loh's gift for writing will ever be put in the service of something a little less self-centered in its self-parody.   Although Ms. Loh's &quot;real&quot; novel may someday come, this one is for fans only.	2001-05-04

In particular, the Sicilian Dragon is something I play only in the least important blitz games, as there are so many variations, and one's king gets stormed so darn often.  From hard experience, I'd known that the Yugoslav variation stuff doesn't work against the accelerated dragon, but I'd never known the move sequences nor how to deal with all those c4 Maroczy Bind situations. This book capably tells you how to play the Accelerated, how to turn back white's efforts to try the Yugoslav Attack, and how to  deal with the bind.  It has a nice chapter on the Hyper Accelerated, and a mildly throwaway chapter on the Semi Accelerated system with ...Nc6 and ....g6.  This is a good book, easily understandable by a B player like myself.  Well done.	2001-05-04

Bc4 in my ICC blitz repertoire.  I'm 1733 USCF over the board, with an ICC blitz rating that can hover anywhere from 1200 to 1600, depending on my mood and the (usually low) quality of my play.  I thought the 2 knights might be fun, because I like the quirky defenses like the Keene Defense to the KG and Bird's variation of the Ruy.<br />Gee, the 2 Knights is one aggressive countergambity, wild opening.  Beliavsky does a really good job of making it interesting, but it's pretty wild, even as a blitz weapon.<br />I'm a timid, second rate player.  If you're the sort of person who loves the King's Gambit as white and loves defending the wilder KG variations as black, you'll probably love the Two Knights.  Me?  I learned that in the rare instances that I play 1 e4, the proper third move for me after black's 3...Nf6 is  4 d3.  It's not that the Two Knights is unstoppable--far from it, it's pretty on the edge lots of times.  It's just that the whole darn thing is just so....complicated!<br />But  if you're into tactics and you want a new blitz weapon, this is a good purchase!	2001-05-02

Their memories did not serve them well, because they had the Aubrey-Maturin series mixed up with the A &amp; E channel's Horatio Hornblower series.  The mistake was understandable,though, because O'Brian's series clearly shows the author's awareness that he is plowing a field that a series of naval novels has already furrowed.  Yet, the Aubrey/Maturin novels do not seem like &quot;knock-offs&quot; of the Horatio Hornblowers; instead, they are quite interesting in their own right.  Aubrey, the sea captain, and Maturin, his ship's surgeon and an intelligence agent, are both interesting, larger than life, and yet human, characters.  The technique of  telling real-life sea battles and portraying real historical personages as minor characters is as old as naval historical fiction, but O'Brian does it so well it never seems forced or pedantic.  The recurring themes of the novel--the consummate sea captain who is all asea on land, the consummate intelligence agent who is anything but intelligent in matters of the heart, do not seem too clicheed,though the author and the reader use them as touchstones, decorative fill-in between the exciting naval stuff.  The Surgeon's Mate manages to make both its naval scenes and its &quot;other story&quot; quite interesting, which is not always as true as the other O'Brian books, in which the naval battles are so fascinating, one longs to be done with the romantic and personal troubles of the protagonists and move on to another sea engagement.  The social commentary--people of the very early 19th C. were human like us, but the social structure was quite different--is, as always in this series, effective because it is not a centerpiece.  We see over and over in these books how cultured and yet how barbaric the practice of this time could be.<br />This is a really good read.  Thisis a really good series. If you haven't given Maturin and Aubrey a go, you should!	2001-04-25

The book is clear, easy reading, and the story, though quite harsh, is never too filled with &quot;woe is me&quot; sentiment.  Ms. Brittain's movement from provincial comfort to &quot;university&quot; to working as a volunteer VAD in the hospitals, coupled with the loss of a brother, a love, and a fiance, makes for fascinating reading.  Ms. Brittain mourns the passing of the youth of the &quot;war generation&quot;, but by the time the book is done, one realizes that the non-combatant &quot;survivors&quot; of Ms. Brittain's own generation--of literary &quot;sets&quot; and chivalric valour betrayed and changes in the social order in deep ferment-- has also passed from among us.  This is not a joyful book, and its narrative voice can be quite bitter.  But it is a meaningful book, and a very good read.  Ms. Brittain's pragmatic feminism resonates well some seventy odd years later.	2001-04-02

One leaves this book convinced that one should add the Grob to one's blitz repertoire.  Although Basman spends a fair bit of time trying to explain the theory, the &quot;ideas behind the opening&quot; sections of the book just don't hold up as well--but is this Basman's fault, the reader's lack of subtlety (I'm only a B player), or the simple that fact that the Grob, while immense fun, does not  really line up as a good old fashioned linear opening?  I'm not sure.<br />I love unorthodox openings, and I cannot deny the fun this book injects into chess with the Grob.  But I think I'll stick to the Lengfellner System, and leave the Grobmaniacs to their party!	2001-03-10

We have the light, airy tone of the main story, a satire upon university academic standards and the new &quot;political correctness&quot; coupled with the rather typical self-absorbed man's search for connection.  There's the requisite &quot;story within a story&quot;, in this case a story about Shakers, stitched onto the main story with rather unsightly thread.  We have intercalary passages of cutesy grammatical humor, popped onto the end of chapters as though it were insight. There's academic politics, rather, odd, misplaced patches of stray violence (in a very brief passage), and even a bit of why-Joanie-can't-read commentary.  We even have the literary equivalent of a &quot;who-dun-it&quot;, in a particularly obvious use of  anonymous notes to our protagonist as a method of communicating commentary.<br />Mr. Downing has a gift for narrative, and an ability to instill credibility into fairly unrealistic characters.  Perfect Agreement is therefore not a bad read.  The protagonist, a grammarian teaching remedial classes who loses his job when a student complains that the standards are discriminatory, is someone with whom the reader can find much good ground. It's not that the plot is a bit silly--that's okay in a light comic novel.  It's not that the story-within-a-story reads like research repacked in fictional form--that, too is often done. It's not the fact that the reader cannot believe for a moment in the tenuous Shaker/modern life connection--frequently, real life connections are similarly incredible.  The problem with this book is that it tries to do too much--it seems as though the author is trying to 'run the paces' with too many traps and devices.   The result is a decent read, but not a particularly good novel.	2001-02-20

The world of self-publishing has undergone a sweeping change due to the internet and changes in printing technology.  This book helps explore the changes, and how to use the changes to help get new self-published works to market.  The book discusses how to use new technology such as print on demand.  The book has a chapter on the e book.  The book's style is light and easy to read, with quotes to leaven up the mix, but the book is not a  mere &quot;wouldn't it be a good idea to write your own book&quot;.  Instead, the book has tons of tips, supported by URLs and e mail addresses of real-live people who have been doing what the author advocates.  <br />This book does not set out to be an encyclopedia of self-publishing, but instead is a good overview, which provides the reader with other resources, including the author's own materials available for purchase on individual topics, at the publisher's own website.  Although we are going to see a lot more of this promotion of &quot;for a fee&quot; resources in modern books, I am not sure that this form of cross-marketing product is going to be the best sales device.  To this reader, it is a dissonant note in the otherwise extremely helpful tone of the work. Indeed, more books would be sold if the majority of the information were free downloads rather than &quot;for a fee&quot; stuff. I don't want to overstress the point--you can read this work cover to cover and get enough tips, URLs and ideas to solidly launch into a self-publishing venture of your own.  But the admittedly modest extent to which this book markets the author's &quot;e info for a fee&quot; service did not work for me.  Still, this is a quibble.  Money spent on this book is money well spent. The work is very readable, using play with fonts and inset to keep the reader hooked, without quite moving into that diagram and comic essay mode of, say, a Ten Speed Press book.    I found myself so interested in this book that I read it cover to cover within two days--which is certainly different from the &quot;resource to be read over time&quot; way in which I view most books in this genre.<br />This book is about non-fiction, but it could apply to fiction writers as well.  Its advice is real-world, and geared to how for an investment of anywhere from several hundred dollars (the e book chapter) to a few tens of thousands (for a splashy full-print run work), one can literally compete in good order with the major publishing houses.<br />The new printing technology, the internet and Amazon.com have killed the dragon of publishing houses, rejection letters from NYC agents, and books that cannot be distributed.

On the one hand, the largest law firms offer astronomic salaries to top graduates of top law schools which bear no resemblance to legal life on this planet pre-1999.  On the other hand, a visit to the message boards...indicates that a goodly number of folks who did not attend a top law school and did not get top grades have a rough time out there when they graduate without a ready job and without the knowledge of what to do next.  Even those of us who did well in school and got that great job out of school worked with lawyers who stumbled in mid-career and never could get back up and running again.  Sometimes it seems from the media and the message boards that everything in law is either spectacular success or wrenching failure.  This has always been a phenomenon of law, as long as the modern legal system has existed.  The difference is that today, the extremes seem more pronounced, as the legal rich get richer, and those with lesser credentials fear that they will only get poorer.<br />Hal Davis' book, Teach Me to Solo, is a welcome antidote to the cancer of doom and gloom which besets some new lawyers whose law school careers bespeak student debt and a difficulty finding a job rather than 150K offers and the BIGLAW partnership track. Davis advocates doing the old-fashioned thing--setting up an office and practicing law.  Davis is well-qualified to write about this topic--he's an MBA who went back to law school mid-career, and promised himself he'd own his own business once he graduated.  This is not one of those &quot;career counsellor&quot; books in which someone with a JD working in a law school placement office tells the reader what the reader &quot;ought to do&quot; (but which the author did not do).  Instead, this is a hands-on,nuts and bolts &quot;set up your office, get your computers, set up phone and fax, do some low cost marketing&quot; hands-on guide from somebody  who did exactly what he preaches.  Although Davis is teaching the reader how to become an old-fashioned solo practitioner, his focus is on using technology and common sense to run your practice on a shoestring.<br />Jay Foonberg and Gerald Singer have written fine books on starting a solo practice.  Davis' book is much less about the theory of getting business and much more about its subtitle, &quot;the nuts and bolts of law practice&quot;.  Some inexperienced (and, sadly, some highly experienced but layoff-prone) lawyers imagine that solo practice is not attainable on the ground of expense and difficulties getting business.  Davis helps show the lawyer how to solve the expense end of things nicely, and gives some good idea on getting business.<br />Some folks think that the great unrevealed secret of law school is that bottom grads of bottom law schools don't get top jobs. A much more important &quot;unrevealed secret&quot; is that middle class America has a great deal of need for services for consumer and small business attorneys who can provide quality services at win-win cost.  Davis is commendably clear-eyed in how to do it, and this is a total brass-tacks book.<br />I attended Davis' seminar prior to setting up a two man suburban law firm (after a decade and a half of &quot;downtown&quot;  midsize commercial litigation).  My partner and I use the things we learned from Davis on a weekly basis.  This book has the same information, at a fraction of the cost of a seminar.<br />This is not a &quot;high concept&quot; book.  This is not the book to read if you want soul-searching about whether to be a lawyer. This is literally how to set up a solo practice with very little money.  With the tips in this book and a little cash, or even  with this book and fairly low paying evening mcjob, you can  really practice law.<br />Don't be the sad sack lawyer who is shipping resumes and feeling despondent.

The plotting and characterization were solid, but not particularly novel.   The &quot;extras&quot; added to the plot are in the main eccentric and interesting, as good mystery cameo players should be.  Ms. Jance's protagonist was somewhat disappointing--a suitable sleuth, but some of the backstory just didn't work for me in this one.  I'd pick up another Jance if I were in the airport and needed a good read, but I wouldn't go out of my way to locate the rest of this series.  What do you get when you cross a dash of Christie, a dash of Hammett, a trace of Paretsky, and a lot of those modern &quot;suburbanesque&quot; detectives....something readable, certainly, but not quite a top flight mystery.  If you need a good read, it's here, but it's a flawed work, and the villain is obvious from way too early in.	2001-02-10

The format feels more like a group of related short stories than a novel, and, indeed, many of the chapters appeared in literary magazines as short stories.  The book lacks the improbable MFA seminar &quot;staginess&quot; that can afflict this type of work.  Instead, it is down to earth and in the main believable.    The attempt to tie together a theme and some of the attempted &quot;subtleties&quot; of the plot seem a bit too pat. Certain of the more &quot;clever&quot; devices--the epistolary &quot;presence&quot; of the (highly dissatisying) father, the &quot;neat&quot; way in which the daughter's evolution is &quot;connected back&quot; into her family in the final chapter, might have been left on the cutting room floor, but Dawid still rates the five star ranking, because, stated simply, Dawid can write.  Dawid can reallly write.  Her characters are people whom you might wish to meet.  The tone of this novel has an air of dysfunction and despair, but you never get the sense that these characters are wretches.  Dawid makes these people interesting and real.   If you like real reads about real people which neither get shrouded in cotton candy nor lost in despair, pick up York Ferry.  It's a good read.	2001-02-07

Some contend that we are in a remarkable and unprecedented era of new &quot;cults&quot; and &quot;heterodoxy&quot;.  Jenkins' work is a timely and highly entertaining reminder that the American religious landscape has always been filled with new faiths dismissed in their time as deviant.  In particular, Jenkins shows that in some instances the very religious movements that were once denounced as new faiths produce the leaders who in turn denounce the faiths that come after them.  I found the work anecdotal and interesting, the kind of book one flips through back and forth rather than necessarily treating as a &quot;novel-style&quot; linear text.<br />One might imagine that a work with Jenkins' theme would run a severe risk of being either a polemic or a dreary dissertation-like tome.  Mystics and Messiahs evades both risks.  Jenkins' writing style is highly readable, and his tone is not that of a pedantic, but of a sympathetic skeptic telling a bit of interesting popular history.  The book is well documented, but there is no loss of a good read in pursuit of an &quot;academically-refined text&quot;.  <br />America's pulsating religious need in our time is the need for tolerance (as the song says, &quot;what's so funny 'bout peace, love and understanding?&quot;).  Jenkins' book illustrates the lessons from our history that past Americans' intolerance has caused us to learn, without interfering with the fact that the story of America's many faiths is a darned entertaining read.<br />It is refreshing to see a level-headed book which is neither &quot;XYZ Evangelist's Book of Cults&quot; or &quot;What Christians Fail to Get about our Wonderful New JLK Faiths&quot;.  Instead, in the Dragnet parlance, it's more &quot;just the facts&quot;, and whether one is a fervent believer or a casual skeptic, this one is a worthwhile read.	2001-02-04

Ernest Holmes cited Troward as a major influence, and it is not hard to see why.  Troward grasped and expressed well the new thought concepts of the interconnection between thought and the physical universe.  Troward is often overlooked today, but he had a great deal of interest to say.<br />Unfortunately, though Troward had some ideas that were a bit ahead of his time, some of his ideas proved him sadly a creature of his time.  The lecture which describes a kind of ethnic manifest destiny for the English people is not a particularly odd notion for his time, but seems particularly poorly-thought-out today.  Troward's good ideas are unfortunately leavened with some deeply flawed ones.  Still, this book is worth a read, and the fact that its title reflects &quot;lectures&quot; should not be taken to mean that this is one of those dry impress-the-academics lectures.  These talks are neither dry nor unduly sermon-y.    This book is an interesting read, even though a few of its ideas are deeply unsatisfying.	2001-01-29

This book is a well-written explanation of Science of Mind ideas, less a &quot;tome&quot; than Ernest Holmes &quot;Science of Mind&quot;, which was the foundation work for lectures and meetings from which the church more or less evolved.  Although Science of Mind writers tend more to argue for their ideas than to really &quot;evangelize a faith&quot;, this work has the slightest flavor of an evangelical work.  The reader should not worry that it is off-putting, however.  It is readable and its ideas are easy to access.  If you wish to understand new thought ideas and an argument for their practical application, this is a good place to start.  You may not be a convert (I am not), but you can find a good bit to understand what these Californians were doing, and how it links up with the entire new thought movement.	2001-01-29

Milne's comedies for adults.  Ms. Cusk has a bit of fun with allusions to the varied novels of country retreat.   Yet, the  novel does not feel artificial at all, nor is it particularly smug. <br />The tone is very light, witty but not fall-down funny.  There's a whiff of Jane Eyre here, and bit of Cold Comfort farm there, maybe a nod or two at Wilkie Collins over yonder, a set of characters who might populate John Mortimer or Muriel Spark novels, a good bit of the class pretension/class distinction motif, and more than a touch (indeed, a whole portion) of the urban dweller goes rural satire.  But this book is not confined by its sources--Rachel Cusk is a *real* novelist, the kind who can take a light comic format and run with it.<br />The plot is straightforward.  Urban twentysomething woman seemingly inexplicably leaves her job to take au pair job in rural setting for wealthy family with disabled son.  Disaster ensues.<br />The thing that makes this a worthwhile read is that one has the sense that Ms. Cusk knows she has a few points to make, but is far too gifted to stop in the middle of this bit of cotton candy to belabor the reader with long-winded condescension to her characters or to the reader.   We don't mind that we have visited this landscape a time or two before, because Ms. Cusk is such a talented tour guide we see new wrinkles in the dilemmae that our previous tour guides have overlooked.<br />A good read.	2001-01-26

A fictionalized first person of a key Newfoundlander's life, coupled with intercalary chapters which are a satiric history of Newfoundland, sounds like one of those heavy tomes worthy of a Canadian TV mini-series rather than a good evening's read.  But this book is a powerful, solid read, the kind of read one imagines cannot be obtained in a modern novel.   Smallwood, Newfoundland's first premier upon its confederation with Canada, is portrayed in a variety of situations throughout a long life, some historical and some fictional.  But this novel does not bear the cobwebs of the &quot;fictional history&quot; genre.  Instead, the book's two major  characters--Smallwood and Sheilagh Fielding--seem as real as life, flawed and fascinating.  <br />This book is vibrant and alive, straightforward, believable,and wholly warm and human. The parts of the book based on actual history are much more fantastic than the parts of the book which are pure fiction. The book explores some interesting ideas--the twin pursuit of compassion and ambition, the persistence of love over time, and the effects on the protagonists of constant self re-invention. The reader comes away with a sense of place as to Newfoundland, with that feeling of having &quot;known&quot; the characters,and with an abiding respect for a gifted novelist.   This is one of the truly great novels I've read.	2001-01-21

The kazoo brings us back to what our childhood taught us--and years of music lessons and choir practices tried to make us forget--that music is a shared bit of fun, nearly as important as--and with no requirement that it be much more difficult than--breathing.  <br />Barbara Stewart's small book takes an appropriately light tone to make the point that playing a kazoo is a fun and worthwhile past-time.  This is not one of those &quot;heavy-reading&quot; history of an instrument works.  This is an intelligent but decidedly light-hearted reintroduction to music-as-fun, instead of music as something played on compact disks.<br />Although I love the sound of a good piano being played, I wonder if life might not be a little more fun for kids if they had fewer piano lessons and more time with a kazoo. As for adults, this book will help you rediscover that you can be musical, and it only costs a dollar or two to rediscover your lost musicality.	2001-01-21

The authors put together a collection of their own essays and of essays of other folks who have self-published on line, using publish on demand, or done a traditional off line self-published  book.  This book has lots of information, and includes numerous citations to other books, and, particularly helpfully, internet URLs where new information and answers to frequently asked questions can be gleaned.<br />The emphasis here is on how to achieve some commercial success for your book, including good advice on inexpensive and free ways to promote your work on line.  This is not a &quot;get rich publishing books&quot; throwaway.  This is a solid effort at an overview of how to really publish your own material with commercial success.  <br />I found the work imperfect in two ways.  My own mode of self-publishing--using inexpensive specialty chapbooks sold in on line auctions, is not covered.  In addition, the work is more geared to the commercial author than to the author of poetry or specialty fiction who just wants to break even and be read. Still, this is a good book.  It offers interesting info, like pamphleteer Paulette Ensign's story of figuring out how to make money in 16 page booklets.   It's nice to hear this sort of thing expressed in real world terms, rather than in &quot;how I made a million&quot; copy.  <br />Dan Poynter's book on self-publishing once set the standard for traditional self-publishing guides, and its updated version is still a good work on the basics of dealing with printers, etc.  But this book offers the reader a good bunch of good ideas, and I recommend it.	2001-01-21

Ford's Parade's End is among the very best of his works.  The centerpiece, Christopher Tietjens, seems on the surface to represent a now-commonplace theme in English literature--the &quot;last English gentleman&quot; metaphorically swept away by modernity in the aftermath of the First World War.  The first of this set of novels, &quot;Some Do Not&quot;, features an opening passage which is laced with brilliant satire, crystal-clear character development, and a style which is utterly accessible and utterly enchanting.  Through the rest of this novel, and well into the next volume, Ford seems to be telling a straightforward &quot;passing of the noble old things&quot; story.  But Ford Madox Ford is rarely so straightforward, and these novels are no exception.   What seems to begin as a mere bemoaning of a passing age turns into a demonstration of the inevitability, and even the desirability of its passing. Although Ford creates a perfect foil to Tietjens to apparently illustrate the vulgarity and superficiality of the modern age, things are not so simple.  Tietjens views his world as irreparably fading, but Ford understands that Tietjens' world may never have existed at all.  Galsworthy's Forsyte Saga and CP Snow's Strangers and Brothers novel cycle both try to show the passing of &quot;old England&quot; and the marching in of modernity. Neither Snow nor Galsworthy, though each is wonderful, does as much with narrative style as Ford does here.  Ford's novels seem to take a simpler approach to the topic by creating Tietjens, the representative of the &quot;old order&quot;, and his wife Sylvia, the representative of the &quot;new&quot;, but by the time that the plot is worked out, the reader comes to understand that Ford has created a hall of mirrors and metaphors, and nothing is as simple as it seems.  <br />Thisis one of the great must-reads of 20th C. English literature.   It's a shame that it's not required Brit lit reading in every college survey.	2001-01-17

One imagines the potential inherent in the as-yet-unexplored life of middle class small town and suburban folks, freed of treacle, of outdated stereotype, of &quot;realistically&quot; implausible dialogue, or fractured postcard home truths by writers who feel themselves somehow above the fray of tract homes and work-a-day jobs.<br />The Man Who Owned Vermont stands out for its characterizations of a 20something man whose job is distributing RC Cola to markets.  He's recently separated, and the plot is driven by the dilemmae of his marital problems.  The dialogue, the characterizations, and the situations are plausible, workable, and real as life. <br />Although an overt theme seems to be unfashionable these days, Mr. Lott adopts as one theme of this work the power of language and words.  The protagonist, though intelligent and reasonably articulate, is, for reasons explained in the story, nearly incapable of any real insight into his own feelings or needs. Lott effectively uses the &quot;supporting characters&quot; as semaphore signals to the reader and to our narrator of what is really going on in his life. Unlike the similar device in Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, we do not come to mistrust the narrative voice of the clueless narrator.  Lott's protagonist is anything but clueless, and, thank heaven, he does not babble or mutter on about obscure lit references like a grad seminar short story hero.  Through patient story-telling, we come to understand that the narrator's emotional disconnection, and its very real effects on his very real life, *is* not only the character, but also the &quot;real&quot; story.  The result is neither played for pathos or humor, but instead the work achieves a quiet, almost meditative, small reflection on the nature of language and story.  The book is subtle, is well worked, and capably written.<br />Surprisingly, the part of the work that satisfies least is the way in which the denouemont is tied together after two disparate sequential events create a sort of twin climax.  The ending seems slightly forced, but the overall effect of the work is that it is believable, very real, and about not only ideas, but also people.<br />If you like small films which use a realistic plot to tell a subtle story, like You Can Count on Me or The Winslow Boy, you'll be apt to like this small book which uses a decent but distracted man to make some interesting points.	2001-01-12

I found myself wanting to know more details about more types of ants, and a bit more coverage of the domestic US ants than this work provides, but it's still a fine work.

The Three Boxes is a related but rather different work.  The author takes on the broader issues of life planning, which includes not only career, but also educational and personal planning.  In some ways, this book is a rebuttal to the traditional college/career/retirement paradigm by showing that people don't have to (and,for that matter, won't even if they wished to) live their lives in the traditional career path straitjacket.   The tone of the work is thoughtful but practical.  <br />A lot of self-help oriented material nowadays seems to focus on mustering your potential to achieve your dreams.  These works have their place, but they fail to answer a preliminary question--how does one know what one wants from life?<br />The Three Boxes is about the task of actually figuring out what you want, and then implementing what you want.  It's remarkably free of needless fluff about the inner person, while filled with practical ideas on &quot;breaking out&quot; of the &quot;traps&quot; of modern career life.  <br />This is a book to own.  It's an easy and thought-provoking read, presented in light style with interesting graphics.	2001-01-01

His Into a Desert Place sets a high standard as a down to earth everyman-on-a-journey walking exploration of the fascinating and yet physically challenging Baja peninsula.<br />This book resumes our acquaintance with Mr. Mackintosh in a much different place in life than Into a Desert Place.  Rather than being a Brit teacher wholly inexperienced in Baja ways,  he starts the book as a married San Diego &quot;old Baja hand&quot;, veteran of many trips and no longer an initiate pilgrim to the ways of the desert peninsula.    If the dialogue portions of the books are any guide, I'd guess his Spanish improved a good bit with time.  His narrative style remains folksy, simple, intelligent and unadorned.<br />In Journey with a Baja Burro, Mr. Mackintosh takes a burro on a trek from Tecate, Mexico down to Loreto.  His travel itinerary takes him past the many missions along the way, and he gives us interesting bursts of history about each.  <br />One might imagine that such a work would merely mirror Into a Desert Place, but the intrigue here is that the author is a changed man, and his Baja has also irrevocably changed.  We still see the down to earth narrative, the simple punning, and the flights into spiritual self-exploration that make the first work so down to earth and yet such a flight of fancy.  But here  we have a bit of the drama of day to day living that the itinerant wanderer faces when he is no longer 25, and his family waits, rather impatiently, at home.   We all grow a bit older, and the beckoning of the open sky tempers for some of us with time--but perhaps not for Mr. Mackintosh.<br />Mr. Mackintosh's gift is that although he understands that some of what he does is quite remarkable, he also understands the personal frailties that he brings to his courageous expeditions.  This book is not the work that Into a Desert Place is, because the author, Baja, and perhaps the world itself is no longer quite the same.  But this is a charming return to a alternative by-lane away from the great superhighway of suburban life, and I urge you to put on your turn signal for a walk with Mr. Mackintosh's burro at your earliest convenience.  You need not read Into a Desert Place to love this one, but if you read this one first, I'm betting you'll go back and pick up the first one next.	2000-12-24

In contrast to the Dominguez' Your Money or Your Life, Mr. Elgin places his focus on describing the reasons for his advocacy for a voluntary alteration to a less consumptive lifestyle.  The book's style is easy and accessible.  The author uses a number of quotations and very brief anecdotes from survey respondents to make the argument that people should scale back into less material obsession and consumption as a way of attaining a more &quot;conscious&quot; life.  <br />The reader is left convinced of the author's sincerity, and of the virtue of stepping away from rampant materialism, but the casual assumptions embedded in the book (the inherent error in modern corporate life, the somewhat leery viewpoint toward some forms of technology) seem a bit unexamined for a work considering the social implications of a more examined life.<br />Still, although I was not swept away with all the ideas herein, this is a well-written book with some real ideas, and deserves the cult status popularity it has achieved.	2000-12-24

It seems to be a challenge some weeks to find a good future history story which is neither hopelessly dated, hopelessly violent, or hopelessly obsessed with adoloscent views of human relationships.<br />Evergence: The Dying Light is an exception to these dreary rules. Although it is the second in a series of which I had not read the first, I found it quite easy to follow.  Although the story has some violence, and the characters are discernibly adult, it is neither a gore-fest nor a teen fantasy quest.  Instead, it is serious sci fi, in the future history mold, with good plot and good characterization.<br />The plot involves a female protagonist in a distant future, with a diverse and sympathetic crew, facing challenges both mundane and devastating under circumstances in which the powers that be know the value of a lot of cards, but they ain't showing their hands.  In other words, it's the &quot;quest among uncertain forces&quot; motif, but done in a fairly fresh, if not quite novel, setting.<br />I instinctively shy away from two-author works because so many either have an unsatisfying &quot;compromise&quot; feel to the narrative voice or have chapters written in different hands so divergent that they barely plot in together.  This book raises no such concerns.  It is well-written, consistent, and holds together.<br />This is not a perfect book.  The future universe created has its interesting aspects, but seems largely synthesized from what has gone before.  There is little of the &quot;oh,wow&quot; about the future extrapolations that result, and I am small-minded enough to confess that I want a little &quot;oh, wow&quot; in my sci fi.  But I recommend this book nonetheless....a solid, good day's read, well done.	2000-12-21

He did not claim to have the &quot;sole and exclusive&quot; revelation of the One Truth about matters spiritual.  He did not assert that he had a &quot;new&quot; revelation, or that he had founded a movement freed from the influences of others.  Instead, he asserted that his movement was a synthesis of ideas from a variety of faiths and traditions, and that his ideas would be improved over time.  <br />Living the Science of Mind sets out Mr. Holmes' new-thought-derived ideas in a very readable, straightforward book.  This book is not laden with endless jargon, nor does it have that &quot;self help book for the soul&quot; feel that some popular religion books can have.  Instead, it tries in intelligent but accessible language to explain Science of Mind beliefs, and to illustrate how those beliefs might be applied in everyday thought.<br />New thought is built in large measure on positive thinking and the belief, to a great or lesser extent, that spiritual practice  can lead to changes in the physicial universe.  Mr. Holmes explains in some detail how he conceives this works in everyday life.  This is not intended as a complex defense of his faith, and the reader from a different tradition will see many questions in the explanations which have not been fully resolved. Still, this is that rare work of religious material which is both practical and filled with ideas.  Some other new thought works seem more like sales pieces than books of faith.  Living the Science of Mind is instead a useful guide to a faith, which does not require the suspension of disbelief to enjoy.  I don't find myself a &quot;new thought&quot; practitioner, but I think the book is both interesting and useful.  Ernest Holmes' thinking has had a bigger influence in our vision of what is the &quot;American Dream&quot; than his Church of Religious Science's impact has been.  This is a good guide to understand where he came from and what it means in everyday terms.	2000-12-16

Her work influenced both the Unity School of Christianity and Religious Science movements.  High Mysticism is arguably the &quot;centerpiece&quot; among her writings on religion. <br />Ms. Hopkins, like all the best of the New Thought writers, was a synthesist of orthodox and heterodox Christian ideas, ideas from the eastern religions, and a number of ideas seemingly spawned anew in the &quot;can do&quot; America of the late 19th and early 20th Century.<br />High Mysticism, as its title suggests, advocates a mystical and metaphysical approach to problems of faith.  The language is  almost self-consciously &quot;religious&quot;, as Ms. Hopkins tries to clothe her ideas in a spiritual language appropriate to their serious purpose.  Unfortunately, while the result is always readable, it sometimes seems a bit stilted and high flown, in the way that 19th Century novels of the fantastic could be. Ms. Hopkins differs from other advocates of new faiths in her era, though, in that Ms. Hopkins advocated an intersection between the metaphyscial ideas with which her work is preoccupied and the mundane everyday in which we all live. In some ways, her work, though it speaks of arcane mysteries, is trying to communicate an accessible spiritual practice.  In this way, Ms. Hopkins arguably deviates from the &quot;secret initiations&quot; of theosophical and other similar movements.<br />Later writers, Ernest Holmes and the Fillmores in particular, would take Hopkins' ideas and express them in much more  reader-friendly language.  But High Mysticism is a must read for anyone who wants to see the &quot;missing link&quot; between Quimby on the one hand, and the modern &quot;positive thinking&quot; faiths on the other hand.  I give this 3 stars because it is not for everyone,but it is consistently interesting, as Ms. Hopkins' ideas dance across the pages.	2000-12-16

Instead, the &quot;gleanings&quot; seem chosen to present some of the core Baha'i ideas in the words of the founder of the faith.  The Baha'i ideas of the core of truth in all religions, the ongoing nature of spiritual prophecy, and the ineffable mystery of God are fascinating reading.    The fact that this faith arose in the 19th Century makes its founders' writings seem much more modern and accessible than  some older religious writing.<br />As one reads other works about Baha'i practice, one might offer the critique of this work that the excerpts really tell the reader more about the ideals of Baha'ism and not enough about the day to day reality of how Bahaullah felt the faith should be practiced.  This is very much a starting point for one interested in Baha'i ideas rather than a comprehensive guide. Still, if you want a good idea of many core Baha'i concepts, you'll find this a readable set of writings.  <br />This book won't tell you &quot;everything you need to know about Baha'is&quot;, but it is interesting for the non-believer as well as for the believer to give a picture window into this faith.	2000-12-16

This book is not just another &quot;Sliding Doors&quot; or &quot;Passion of Mind&quot; work, although being either of those works is not a bad thing to be.  Ms. Anshaw wants to illumine character with her plot device--what becomes of an Olympic silver medalist in three alternative scenarios based on different choices the swimmer makes during the next 20 years. The themes of betrayal and its effect on the ability of the betrayed to share intimacy are well spun out here.  This is a good book, and the Missouri scenes' atmosphere is very down to earth and real.	2000-11-26

The collection largely avoids reaching for trite conclusions, and also avoids the forced ambiguity that sinks many a creative writing professor trying to write about &quot;normal&quot; people.  Almost every story is involving, only one or two descend into situations which seem too contrived.  This collection is a pleasure to read--engaging, and by design somewhat small in focus.	2000-11-26

The work has very much the feel of a serialized sci fi mag piece from Astounding or some such.  The usual ingredients are there--a collection of disparate characters enmeshed in a handful of subplots, the mildly dystopian but recognizable earth of fifty years hence, a global threat,  eccentric yet capable minds that work to solve it, and, finally, not one but two little puzzle mysteries, with punch line endings to both inquiries.  Sheffield's plotting is a real strength; the characterization is a bit pat.  I recommend this one, though, as the central dilemma is compelling, and the book lacks the gratuitious glandular or violent juvenalia which infects so many more modern sci fis.  This is a fun afternoon, rather than an epic voyage, but not every unmanned satellite can discover a new universe....	2000-10-22

A game based upon a battle metaphor and individual confrontation has a great deal of symbolic material and ideas as a source of poetry.  Solway's poems, using the chess imagery as a springboard for a number of observations and images, work quite well.  Nothing in this work is the daring gambit that a 19th Century poet might bring to the chess motif, but in poetry, as in chess, the thrill of the unrestrained tactician has largely given way to the quiet, restrained accumulation of minor advantages and arcane theoretical novelties.  If Mr. Solway's poems strike one more as the work of a positional Petrosian than a madness-tinged Morphy, the reader does not suffer.  The work does not make any bold sacrifices in search of a quick checkmate, but the use of the metaphor to describe family interactions is quietly winning, and ultimately succeeds.  This is accessible material, capably written, and I recommend it.	2000-09-30

One is more apt  to run into the movie on cable than to run across the book.  Although I  like the movie, I liked the book much, much better. The movie features  sweeping plot turns, while the book is a matter of simple, credible steps.  The theme is the aftermath of World War II, and recovering one's civic  sense after dealing with it.  In modern terms, it might be called the  sequel to Saving Private Ryan, in which the captain returns to civilian  life.<br />We pick up the plot in medias res--the hero has stumbled,  uninspired through a few years of peacetime which hold none of the promise  that seemed evident prior to the war.  The author does a good job of  plugging us into this man-and-his-family plot without either the soap suds  or a preachy tone taking over. Nothing in the book is a particular  revelation--there are no real gasps in the plot.  But the enterprise is  carried off in a competent, undecorated style which keeps one hooked right  through to the end.  There's a world of metaphor here, but  these  characters feel real, and the metaphoric situations that the hero and his  family must endure to find a place in a changed world come off more live  than memorex.  A domestic drama can indeed be written without losing the  reader or drenching the reader in soap.<br />This is one of those good rainy  afternoon reads.  It won't save your soul, but it might help you slog  through another cloudy day.	2000-09-09

Given such a prolific writer,  the reader might expect with dread to encounter 900 pages of occupations of  great-grandparents, musings in correspondence, and constant press  quotes--the fodder of the &quot;I've got a book deal and I'm gonna put out  a tome&quot; kind of bio writing that we see all too often.<br />Coles' book  is a breath of fresh air.  In a hundred and a half pages he gives us an  overview of her life and ideas, framed by excerpts from his own interviews  with Ms. Day in her later years.  Coles' editorial voice is always present,  but generally open-minded.  This is not a literary biography, evaluating  the merit of Ms. Day's writings, nor a social biography, intending to give  us all the inner workings of the Catholic worker movement.  Instead, this  is a meditation on the inspirations and contradictions inherent in this  very rich life, told as often as possible from Mr. Coles' impression of Ms.  Day's own take on her life-as-lived.<br />I read this in an evening and a day,  and found it inspiring, satisfying, and altogether well written.  Sometimes  I wished Mr. Coles had put a little less of his first person impressions  into his reportage of interviews with Ms. Day,but other times I wanted more  of Mr. Coles' touchstone analysis of what Ms. Day was saying.<br />A  reasonable critique of this book is that one could read it and still fall  well short of understanding Ms. Day's thoughts or the details of her life.   The somewhat sunny tone may be perceived as uncritical.  For me, though,  this was a great bio--get in, get the job done, get out, leave an image as  clear as a descriptive poem.  This is a good read--I highly recommend.	2000-08-08
US	51985044	R22I4S811DTXAA	155622785X	741006524	Our Texas Heritage: Ethnic Traditions and Recipes	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Not just another multi-cultural survey	Books about which ethnic groups came to settle a region tend to read like rough drafts of a master's thesis--all stray facts gleaned from sources, and no really interesting stories. Multi-cultural cook books tend to be filled with instructions such as &quot;find restructured ghee at your local Bengal market&quot;, rather than practical ways to prepare meals with food one is likely to have on hand. Thus, one might imagine that Dorothy McConachie's survey of ethnic traditions and recipes of the folks who settled Texas between the Civil War and World War I might be a dreary hybrid of the trivial and the impossible-to-prepare. Instead, the book is an easy, enjoyable read, and the recipes are all within reach of the average cook using average ingredients. I am of the &quot;heat and serve&quot; school of cooking, and yet I think I can prepare most things in this book.<br />I particularly liked that the book, while non-trivial, has lots of &quot;important little details&quot; that such a survey written thirty years ago might lack. Among the native American groups, we get not only the expected discussion of Comanche practices, but also the oft-forgotten Caddo groups are discussed. The interrelation among the Polish, German and Wendish settlers is noted, making for an interesting contrast between the &quot;old country&quot; and the new.<br />The style of the book is very easy to follow. Each ethnic group gets a discussion of a few pages in interesting, anecdotal detail, followed by a few recipes which utilize &quot;normal&quot; American kitchen ingredients. The recipes are not mere curios, but instead are things one might wish to prepare--empanaditas from Mexico, a Czech dill soup, a challah (rich egg bread), and good old-fashioned spoon bread. <br />Too often we think of &quot;Texas cooking&quot; or even &quot;southern cooking&quot; as a monolith, just as we mistakenly think of the Anglo settlers of Texas as one ethnic group. This book helps explain who settled Texas, and provides special dishes for each group. Best of all, the whole thing is readable, fun, and devoid of that &quot;footnote feel&quot; which a zealous graduate student or addicted hobbyist can give this type of book.<br />Although the focus is on groups which settled Texas, the book is quite useful to generally understand the diverse cuisines which came along with the &quot;pioneer experience&quot;. If you like your history to be real, anecdotal and laced with recipes for things like spritz cookies, you'll enjoy this.	2000-08-07

Its plot device, much like the slightly superior Framley  Parsonage, is to show the effects of poor choices and the way in which life  sometimes gives folks pretty just desserts for the silly choices they make.  As with all Trollope, though, the plot is a jaunty cover for his real  theme, which is a social satire of his era in an effort to illumine human  nature.  Sometimes Trollope's plot devices had a different effect on the  reader than he intended.  Lily Dale, placed in the novel largely to  illustrate  the consequences attendant to self-willed dedication to  victorian ideas of true love,  in fact became a celebrated character in her  time as an example of a perfect jilted lover.  It is somewhat amusing  reading the novel today, seeing how Trollope showed Lily as a stubborn girl  from a stubborn family, stubbornly devoted to &quot;Love&quot;, and then to  think that in his time, Lily was seen as a perfect avatar of true  love.<br />This is a good read--lots of rich satire of persons of both high  and low station.  It is not Trollope's best, but it is a good read, and  well worth a Sunday afternoon read. If you have not read Trollope, prepare  for a richly human story laced with satire.  If you have read Trollope,  then expect a wit slightly less sharp but a story a bit more engaging than  his others.  His character Crosbie, the &quot;villain&quot; of sorts, is a  fine creation, and this one is worth a read.	2000-07-16

Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey books are diverting detective fiction, set in a 20s and 30s England in which an aristocrat who is much less silly than he sometimes pretends to be goes about  solving  well-thought-out literary puzzle mysteries.  As the saying goes, if Lord  Peter did not exist, we would have to invent him.<br />Strong Poison marks the  introduction of Ms. Sayers' love interest for Lord Peter, Harriet Vane.   Ms. Vane, a curious mix of 19th Century  ideas and 20s era feminism, is a  mystery writer (and, in this volume, accused murderess) in her own  right.<br />Apparently, some of those folks they call &quot;purists&quot; took  a dislike to Ms. Vane, much preferring Lord Peter to be assisted only by  his  Jeeves-like gentleman's gentleman, Bunter. In fact, Sayers' Harriet  Vane is a thorough delight.   <br />This book is the first of a set of  subplots in a love story notable for the fact that its heroine is  frequently described as &quot;not pretty&quot;, the affair is one of the  head as well as heart, and  the enchanting quirkiness of the couple makes  the chase a bit winding but the result inevitable.<br />Is the plot a bit of  whimsy?  Absolutely.  But, after all, it is Lord Peter Wimsey, and that  makes it all come out right.<br />If you've not read this, I strongly  recommend.  If you have read this, take a good afternoon, and return to the  Wimsey/Vane world.	2000-07-15

I found the whole  thing extremely readable.  <br />Perhaps the most amusing part of the book is  the way in which Ms. Strouse portrays the &quot;intelligentsia&quot; in Mr.  Morgan's art world--Roger Fry, Berenson--less as interesting evolutionary  figures in the history of art criticism and more as real flesh and blood  folks in search of a position or a commission.  &quot;Catty&quot;, Fry and  Berenson seem to be synonyms in the Strouse lexicon.<br />I'm not a great  reader of biographies, but this one is pretty darn interesting.

Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien with the &quot;Inkling&quot; writers, Charles Williams' voice is arguably the most curious.  Williams' seven novels discuss the  triumph of a  vibrant, mystical, rather unorthodox Christianity over the forces of occult  despair.  <br />Williams was by instinct a poet with more than a bit of  Tennison among his influences.  His books are fairly easy reading, even  though he alternates between rather vivid literary allusion and an  idiosyncratic stream of narrative consciousness.  In this book, he  personifies salvation and damnation in characters who, despite all the odd  phrasing and high flown prose, seem eminently human.  The passage in which  a character meets a final damnation is extremely effective, neither preachy  nor filled with that sort of &quot;tacky Mr. Scratch and his horrid  fire&quot; sensibility that some writing about the afterlife can have.   This, along with the other six novels in the series (the series is linked  thematically and stylistically rather than by plot), is certainly worth a  read.<br />In our time, we see a lot of Christian fiction which seeks to tell  stories of salvation and damnation through the use of fantasy characters   (Peretti and his imitators come to mind).  Yet, Williams' work, consciously  literary, willing to risk heterodoxy to make a point, and infused with a  victorian poetic sensibility, consistently takes the reader to places that  the modern works fail to glimpse.  <br />In short, Charles Williams is the  real thing,  and well worth a read.	2000-07-15

The New Thought philosophies espoused by that and a number of other metaphysical groups utilize terms of art which frequently appropriate and  redefine common usages from Christian, Buddhist and Hindu theology.  This  book provides a helpful guide to the reader--whether adherent to New  Thought ideas or not--to understand &quot;what the words mean&quot; in New  Thought writing.  Holmes has a conversational, Sunday preacher writing  style which is easy to digest. As any apologist for a faith might, his  elucidation of the terms includes a fair bit of advocacy of the ideas.  The  mildly evangelical undertone, however, does not detract at all from the  usefulness of the book as a study guide in the terms and ideas of New  Thought.  New Thought ideas pervaded our popular culture for the better  part of the 20th C. such that many New Thought ideas are no longer seen as  &quot;new ideas&quot;, but instead as mainstream truisms.  Holmes would  undoubtedly find this entirely appropriate, as he did not claim for his  faith an exclusive message or a freedom from influences outside the faith.   New Thought is interesting in and of itself, but it is also a fascinating  window into a very American system of theology.  Although this work is a  &quot;dictionary&quot; of &quot;terms&quot;, it is not dry reading.  Holmes  instead is clear and reasonably simple in his language.  Holmes' great gift  as a writer was to be able to write popular theology which was not unduly  laden with abstruse ideas. This work exemplifies the best of his writing,  and is an excellent starting point for anyone who wishes to understand  better just what the New Thought adherents believe, and the language of  this branch of American metaphysics.  The skeptic or believer in a  different faith may find much to disagree with in Holmes' work, but the  book is nonetheless a good exercise in just what Holmes did believe and  preach.  In some instances, New Thought writing can seem to be all  &quot;positive thinking&quot; and no system.  Holmes' work seeks to  systematize the ideas, without alienating the reader.  In the main, the  work succeeds in this task.	2000-06-06

James Herriot's stories about a country vet in the 1930's and 1940's present a warm, fascinating set of yarns about a bygone time.  The Herriot reader intuitively understands that the real story is not the literal set  of cures and pet names listed in the stories, but instead, a Yorkshire  culture that was swiftly passing before what then was considered modernity.   The Herriot universe is peopled with charming farmers, the whimsical and  amusing fellow vets, the Farnon brothers, and a world of amusing  coincidences among the vet cases assigned to Mr. Herriot. In his biography,  Graham Lord sets out to show the real vet behind the novelist.  In so  doing, he portrays a fellow who was, as in the books, a rather shy, quiet,  likable man.  Some Herriot loyalists in some instances may be alarmed to  discover that Mr. Herriot's real life was not as idyllic as the books, and  that the books contained a fair bit of fiction.  On the whole, though, the  reader will understand and appreciate that the Herriot stories are not  bounded by inquiries such as &quot;was Siegfriend Farnon really as charming  as the character in the books?&quot; or &quot;was the real-life Helen a bit  more domineering than the one in the books?&quot;.  Graham Lord's bio is a  straightforward read, which,while largely sympathetic, spends a fair bit of  time trying to show that some of the Herriotverse was mythic.  The style of  the writing is clear and easy.  The format of the bio is fairly  conventional, though we are in the main spared the sort of speculation  about the inner philosophies of grandparents that mar some literary bios.   The bio is reasonably short of hyperbole.   The real puzzle of the Herriot  life is how this natural storyteller developed his craft and evolved such a  fully-formed fictive universe.  The Lord bio devotes some attention to this  issue, but not nearly enough.  Instead we are left with anecdotes  suggesting that the Herriot novels are only fifty percent fact.  This is  really beside the point,<br />much as it is irrelevant whether a historical  Sir John Falstaff was really a buffoon.  I recommend this bio, as it shows  a life quietly but in the main well lived, and a writer who developed  fascinating material from a creative imagination and a colorful perspective  on the everyday.	2000-06-06

His characters tend to be ordinary folks caught up in extraordinary situations, whether they wear a janitor's togs or a general's  bars.  Although he gives his books a contemporary feel, they also hearken  back to the 1930s and 1950s magazine based stories.  Mr. Niven himself  wrote for some of the later magazines, and this novel is a sort of long  sequel to a series of time travel stories.<br />Niven's approach to this Mars  time travel satire mines liberally from science fiction that has gone  before.  Its central conceit is satisfying and useful--what if every  science fiction story and misplaced scientific theory about Mars were true?   Analogously to Heinlein's Number of the Beast, Niven harvests from a rich  field of Martian myths and stories.  <br />Although this is a time travel  work, Niven thankfully spares us any &quot;hard science&quot; effort to  explain the time paradox.  He's out to mine a solid satiric story from his  material, and he manages to accomplish his goal without unduly burdening  his story with inside jokes.<br />This book uses the traditional Niven  narrative devices, but it feels much more like comic material such as  &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; than the &quot;fantastically improbable  crisis made real through good characterization and patient  explanation&quot; which usually denotes Niven novels. Yet, although the  work is a satire, it rarely plays for cheap laughs.  The author creates a  dilemma, builds a series of characters to resolve the dilemma, and winks at  the audience quite a few times in doing so.  It feels like a book-length  issue of Astounding Magazine, re-issued in 2010.   Fans who want a detailed  and realistic bit of Niven unreality will be disappointed.  Fans who don't  mind a stretch will be pleased. This one marches to a different drummer,  but the beat's not at all bad, and sometimes you can dance to it.	2000-06-04

Her Fairacre books use a single school teacher in a small English village as an observer of a richly  realized provincial life. One is tempted to wax on about the influence of  Jane Austen and Charles Dickens in her work, or to somehow disparage Jan  Karon, who has created a Readesque world from a North Carolina milieu.  No  doubt one day folks will write their masters' theses discussing how Ms.  Read and Muriel Spark headed for many of the same places, and yet reached  such different destinations.  But really, all that folderol would be  missing the point completely.  Miss Read writes warm, sentimental gentle  English provincial satire, which is really all you need to know.<br />The  Fairacre characters are ordinary folks, burnished up a bit, as novels tend  to do, so that they are entirely believable in their own universe, but not  necessarily a part of our own &quot;real world&quot;.  Miss Read is not a  pollyanna, nor does she set out to teach us some social lesson. Instead,  she sets out for the reader a solid meal of good characterization, gentle  wit, and a solid dessert of warm-hearted sentiment.<br />Storm in the Village  deals with a dilemma all too familiar to anyone from a small town--the town  church is damaged, and money must be found to repair it.  The book exists  in a world of happy endings and wonderful good fortune, but the  straightforward plotting is beside the point.  We do not live in suspense  about the ending--we just enjoy with pleasure how our characters make the  ending happen.  Miss Read is not out to convert us to move to Fairacre, or  even to cause us to create our own Fairacres.  But she does offer us a  chance to peek through the gauze into a middle-class life whose virtues and  foibles we recognize and appreciate.  Perhaps someone out there now is  toiling away on rescuing our suburban stories from the smug modernisms of  the latter-day aesthete.  In the meantime, though, Miss Read shows us that  the ordinary life, well told and  brushed up a bit about the edges, can  make a darn good read.  <br />Storm in the Village is not going to make you  pause and ponder life's inner contradictions. But it may allow you to sigh  with relief on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  What could be wrong with that?	2000-06-04
US	51985044	R2I0F8SMXLKKYM	0891075275	145017176	Piercing the Darkness	Books	2	6	16	N	N	This work captures the attention, but is thematically flawed	Frank Peretti excels at writing gripping suspense fiction about a universe in which the battle between good and evil takes place on a spiritual plane which is both literal and personified.  If one undertakes to read the story  as fantasy fiction, it is more satisfying than much work in this genre.   Peretti's work, however, is encumbered by the heavy-handed themes he  imports into the novel.  Peretti's goal is to portray new age ideas as not  merely unsound, but literally demonic.  Although the literal way in which  he melds this theme into his plot makes for reasonably satisfying genre  fiction, the novel is distinctly unsatisfying as a work of spiritual  inspiration.  Mr. Peretti's dogged fictive separation of the sheep from the  wolves lacks the spirit of Christian charity which is the theoretical point  of the work.  One is reminded somewhat of Ayn Rand's work--Ms. Rand was  frequently so intent on making her particular points about the virtues of  selfishness that otherwise enjoyable popular fiction was weighed down by  &quot;lumpy-faced&quot; socialist villains as stick-figured as a tinkertoy.   Similarly, Peretti hands out damnation and orthodoxy with such a  determined hand that the work must be deemed off-putting if absorbed as  other than a work of fantasy fiction.  This is a work aimed for the  evangelical Christian audience, but its tone is distinctly unbeatifical.   It's not a bad read, but it's not good theology, either.  Given that Mr.  Peretti has a talent for a crackling good yarn, one wishes that this novel  were not so laden with easy conclusions and flawed metaphor. I give this  one 2 stars because the author knows how to write fantasy, but this is a  disturbing work, which definitely brings Mr. Peretti's sword rather than  any peace to the issues of religious diversity.  I do not recommend this  work unless you are willing to overlook poor theology in the pursuit of a  good fantasy read.	2000-05-21
US	51985044	R19JGXGOPNBHTJ	0553273213	954102735	Goodbye, Mr. Chips	Books	5	15	18	N	N	Hilton's simple paean to a teacher wears well	James Hilton's work sometimes shows its age from the vantage point of sixty five years later.  In the case of Lost Horizon, the story becomes a set piece, lost in its 1930s era assumptions.  Random Harvest is rarely  read, as its voice also seems better suited to BBC makeover dramas than  poignant reading.   Hilton's simple, sentimental story about an English  school teacher, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, remains as unabashedly accessible as it  must have been when it was written.<br />The story recaps the professional  life of a devoted teacher.  But Mr. Chipping is not the &quot;to the  ramparts&quot; crusader we see in our current movies of the week.  Unlike  Hard Times or the sloganeering of our current political debates, Goodbye,  Mr. Chips is not a call for wholesale reform of an educational system.   Instead, Hilton uses the Chipping character as a metaphor for the value of  education in giving the student that most elusive of the commodities of  civilization, a sense of proportion.  <br />The novel's style is magazine  fiction in the best sense of the phrase.   The story is propelled jauntily  along, through flashbacks and ironic anecdote.  Although the author's  approach may be said to be sentimental, the construction of the plot and  the direct yet subtle way in which the themes are driven home are quite  appealing.  Hilton wrote at the time that &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;  was written in a single burst, with little need for revision (a work of  &quot;inspiration&quot;).  The book does indeed read as though the author  understood the potential in his story from the opening paragraph  onward.<br />Mr. Chips' schoolbound world is not a &quot;real world&quot; in  many ways, and yet the novel retains a sense of warmth and reality that  many schoolboy days books cannot sustain.  Hilton squeezes into a brief  novella gentle wit, a mild love story, and shrewd observations about the  importance of a sense of permanence.  In some ways, Mr. Chipping is a  metaphor for thesurvival of English middle-class life in the wake of the  first world war. We might also view Hilton's creation of Mr. Chipping in  the late 1930s as an attempt to preserve the English middle-class sense of  proportion and the rightness of things for a generation under the shadow of  the impending war against fascism.  Whether we take Goodbye, Mr. Chips as  an extended metaphor, or merely as a crackling good read, we are drawn  again and again to its quiet, direct story and simple message. In a time  when we are rediscovering the virtues of simplicity, perhaps it is time we  rediscovered the value of educators who pass our values through the  generations.  This English novel retains its relevance to contemporary  people worldwide.  Hilton's simplest novel may well be considered his best  one.  I highly recommend this slim volume.	2000-05-21
US	51985044	RX4F8CC2L4OO4	0684815001	763680226	The Cost of Discipleship	Books	5	24	25	N	N	Cheap Grace and Difficult Choices	Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Cost of Discipleship explores the challenges of embracing the gospel theme of sacrifice.  In a direct, sometimes harsh assessment, he points up the difficulty of actually living a creed which  embraces sacrifice of the individual believer called to task by the  divine.<br />The phrase &quot;cheap grace&quot; remains the watch-phrase of  the work.  &quot;Cheap grace&quot; refers to the counterfeit  self-acceptance the would-be believer experiences, and is discussed in  sharp contrast to the genuine experience caused by the demands of the  Christian faith.  Bonhoeffer cautions us against 'easy religion' and mere  emotive response to the Christian message.  He portrays Christian life as  demanding unflinching self-awareness and struggle, culiminating in  surrender.<br />In later writings, Bonhoeffer himself modified the viewpoints  he set forth in the Cost of Discipleship.  An argument can be made that the  work's stringent tone fails to convey the richness of the Christian life to  which his book seeks to call adherents.<br />Nonetheless, Bonhoeffer's  construct of &quot;cheap grace&quot; serves as a useful metaphor in a time  in which materialism, inequity, and disconnection plague us.  We may not  choose Pastor Bonhoeffer's iron-clad distinctions as to what constitutes  authentic spiritual experience, but we will not easily forget his call to  embrace the genuine, and not merely counterfeit assuaged feelings for  genuine spiritual experience.<br />Although this is a work of theology  accessible to most readers, it is never patronizing in tone.  Although one  would have only a limited vision of Bonhoeffer's work if one read only the  Cost of Discipleship, this is an excellent first Bonhoeffer book to read.  The Cost of Discipleship is not a radical work, but rather a work of  then-mainstream Christianity intended to provoke the reader into action.  Even if one cannot reach all of Bonhoeffer's conclusions, and even if one  does not share Bonhoeffer's theology, the inquiry is certainly worth  undertaking.	2000-05-21

Although Deborah  Arron spends the requisite space in trying to help guide the reader through  the decision-making process, she also provides solid research tips on the  various alternative professions to the legal professions.  She also points  up other choices within the legal profession available.  This book is a  good &quot;one stop&quot; career change book. Lawyers are in on a great  secret of sorts in the form of this resource, when almost all of its  information would be equally useful to any educated mid-life career  changer.  Although the book's Fourth Edition has a lot of internet URL  cites and up to the minute information, the fast pace of our job market is  already rendering it short a few key URLs and job ideas.  One example is in  the healthcare career summary, where I might have expected to see  physician's assistant, nurse anesthesist and perhaps even nurse  practitioner (each being a professional way into a responsible,  well-compensated career requiring far less education and expense than med  school). Also, as teaching is a common career path for some lawyers, I  might have expected to see more descriptive material in the education  section, such as states that offer user-friendly alternative certification  programs.  On the whole, though, these are quibbles.  Ms. Arron has written  a book which does a public service--and what higher calling for a lawyer  can there be?	2000-05-05

The conception is straightforward--a well-defined yet flexible filing system for all of the essential papers of  one's life.  Don and Nora Donnelly created a home filing system that even  the least organized consumer can implement.   This system is useful for  virtually anyone.  One particular virtue the system may have, though, is  for the 20something just starting out in the adult world, who would rather  have a filing system based on organization rather than whimsy.  The second  ideal consumer might be the &quot;tried and failed&quot; filer who faces a  mountain of paperwork, a jumble of well-intentioned but roughly useless  files, and wants to bring order from chaos.    Even the established  &quot;neat as a pin and every paper in place&quot; filer, though, can find  useful ideas in how this system works.  Don and Nora Donnelly don't waste  the reader's time with pep talks about filing or pseudo-psychology.   Instead, this filing system is practical in the greatest degree. In other  words, this is not just &quot;some book&quot;, this is a real filing  system.  If you are having trouble (or need a gift for someone who never  wishes to have trouble) with filing solutions, I recommend you try  FileSolutions.	2000-05-05
US	51985044	R19ZT0NHQKM236	0446362816	274942777	Patternmaster	Books	4	23	27	N	N	Taut little coming of age novel	The coming of age novel was a golden age mainstay. Butler's work here is reminiscent of the novellae of golden age writers.   As we might have been in an Asimov, Heinlein or Silverberg, we are placed in midstream in a  future history constructed as an extension of other Butler novels.  Butler  novels typically feature the dilemma of being human in a dystopian  setting--this novel is no exception.  This &quot;future earth&quot;,  inhabited by one group of humanoids with enhanced mental powers, and  another group of intelligent nomads infected by an alien virus, is easy to  wrap one's imagination around even if one is not familiar with the  Butlerverse.  Butler also spares us the detailed rehash of &quot;prior  future history to the present future history&quot; that could weigh down  (and no doubt increase word counts in Astounding Magazine of serializations  of) the golden age novels.  Instead,we have all of Butler's strengths at  play--a direct, intelligent writing style, an ability to convey character  in spare, plausible phrases, and plotting which is neither heavy science  nor pure fantasy, but has a unique fictive plausibility allowing an easy  &quot;buy-in&quot; by the reader.  The book also has the factors that can  make a Butler slightly off-putting--casual violence, a chilling  soul-lessness permeating the characters, and an abiding sense of otherness.   If you've always wanted to try Butler, but want to do one in an afternoon  to see if you like her, this is the one to try.  I read this during a 3  hour interval, and found myself never bored nor particularly desirous of a  longer stay in this particular world than need be.  Butler is the real  thing--and this is not a bad introduction to her.	2000-04-22

The story largely takes place in Sweden and aboard ship.  Moberg's characters are  humble, and yet insightful.  Even during the gentle satire in which the  author engages from time to time, the author never loses his deep sense of  fellow feeling for the players in his historical novel.  The novel is  written in a spare, understated style, as might be heard in a long  conversation with a trusted relative.  Although the characters are chosen  to show the disparate economic and religious reasons for emigration, Moberg  never lets the need to tell a universal story stand in the way of the  imperative to tell the story at hand.  The novel is earthy, and in some  instances vulgar, although the matter of fact tone and scrupulous avoidance  of needless sensationalism gives these elements a realistic feel.  Although  the Swedish culture is a character in this book--and arguably the main  character--the reader never feels as though the book will lose its way in  the &quot;set piece story about the great migration&quot; dangers inherent  in such a universal plot.  Moberg understands the economic and spiritual  needs that drive his characters to the voyage, but the Emigrants  foreshadows that both economic and spiritual challenges await the  travellers at their destination.  Although we see much of man's inhumanity  to man in this book,  the tone does not overwhelm one with despair.  This  is a book to read to understand what happened three generations ago--and to  speculate whether things have really changed spiritually three generations  later, even as material prosperity has arrived.	2000-03-15

In some ways, people think of this forest as a local place without the splendor of Yosemite or the fascination of Death Valley.  But this book shows that the Angeles National Forest has charms  all its own--here are glorious chapparal in bloom, spring waterfalls in a  dry land, century plant spikes blooming brightly against stark mountain  landscapes, and fall leaves in hidden canyon passes.  If you love this  forest, you will love this book; but perhaps the most important thing is  that even if you don't know this forest, you will love this book.

US	51985044	RO5RPE68FG48V	0708984630	839667639	Grand Canary (CH) (Charnwood Library)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	A departure less exotic than simply odd	The change of scene novel seemed to be a staple among the mainstream novelists of the 1930s and 1940s, particularly those who hovered, as Cronin did, in the nether regions between the merely popular novelist and the  &quot;literary&quot; novelist.  In Grand Canary, we see some of the stock  devices of Cronin novels--a driven young doctor, the caustic impact of  passion, the struggle for redemption.  Yet, instead of the outward struggle  through medical school and inward struggles amid doubt, Catholicism and  Protestantism which usually informs a Cronin novel, we are here exposed to  a trip to the Canary Islands.  This is rather a stark contrast from the  Irish and English scenes more familiar to Cronin readers, and the book's  atmospherics seek to invoke a certain &quot;other-island-worldiness&quot;.   One cannot help but note that Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh in this era  were both using exotic locale as a canvass for resolution of a spiritual  inward conflict, and it is quite safe to say that this is nowhere near as  satisfying in evoking an exotic place as, say, Greene's Power and the  Glory.  But for those of us who enjoy a Cronin novel, such academic  discussion is of secondary importance--the real question is whether the  novel is a good read.  The answer is simple: Cronin's use of locale and  certain &quot;mystical&quot; elements detracts from the reader's interest  in his characters.  We have precognitive dreams, yellow fever, destined  encounters of newly enchanted lovers, a missionary gone astray in a first  exposure to the pleasures of the flesh, and the victim of unrequited love  martyring herself in the name of familial duty.  It's all rather like a  parody of a Somerset Maugham tropical clime short story, except that we  have Cronin's idiosyncratic faith-based vision rather than Maugham's  skepticism putting the puppets through their paces.  The novel is by no  means a bad read--some of the characters are quite intriguing, if a bit  &quot;set piece&quot; in design.  But the plot devices and cardboard side  players are less than we expect from Cronin, and perhaps less than we  expect from ourselves when we seek out light fiction to read.	2000-03-04
US	51985044	R1C2R6CKNMF6BI	0684838273	889214042	Letters and Papers from Prison	Books	5	249	254	N	N	Poignant, connected, universal	Dietrich Bonhoeffer's Letters and Papers from Prison show the reader the thoughts of a man who wrote with immense insight under circumstances fraught with the deepest despair.  Prior to the war, Bonhoeffer had established himself as a visionary, if somewhat moderate, young Christian  theologian.  His imprisonment by the Nazis in the wake of the failure of  the conspiracy to assasinate Hitler gave rise to this series of letters,  ranging from the trivial to the most profound, reflecting the thoughts and  ideas of a man whose ideas continued to evolve, even as hope dwindled.  It  is tempting to see Bonhoeffer as a sort of modern Christian saint  &quot;set-piece&quot; of a man, or a Spielberg movie waiting to be made.   Such an interpretation of the man would trivialize the flesh and blood  reality of his life, as these letters demonstrate. Collections of letters  typically suffer from one of two defects--either they are inanely trivial  and gossippy, or they spend far too much time on being &quot;literary&quot;  for posterity, and not enough time giving real insight into the writer.   Bonhoeffer's letters avoid both of these traps.  Although the letters  collection is not overly burdened by the confessional, letters to his  parents and fiance help us understand in very human terms the horror of  imprisonment by the Nazis, notwithstanding their careful phrasing to avoid  the censor's pen.  The letters do contain some of the intentionally  &quot;literary&quot;--Bonhoeffer writes poetry which is reasonably spare  and connective and sometimes writes for the hypothetical future reader.   But the real tour de force is Bonhoeffer's analysis of the evolution of his  theological thought in light of the changes wrought by modernity and made  apparent to him through his experiences.  In several reasonably succinct  but incredibly sweeping letters, he outlines a new vision of Christianity,  a form of post-Christian Christianity if you will, which has generated a  half century ofdebate and provided inspiration to Christian and  non-Christian alike.  In this age in which &quot;liberal&quot; religion has  been sadly equated by some with &quot;flaccid&quot; religion, we see  through these letters a deeply disciplined thinker outlining the way for  Christianity to remain relevant in a world all too ready to try to  &quot;outgrow&quot; the faith.  Although his thinking is complex, and in  some instances he assumes a base of knowledge of late 19th C and early 20th  C. Christian theology the 21st C. casual reader may not have, the letters  are quite accessible and profoundly human.  This is not a man building a  neat construct out of his dissertation.  This is a condemned man hinting at  the blueprint for the transformation of a faith.  Although it is tempting  to suggest that this is a &quot;Christian masterpiece&quot; of 20th C.  faith, the suggestion is a disservice.  This is a masterpiece of literature  which transcends genre or faith.  In the interminable list of intellectual  heroes of the 20th C., we rarely see Pastor Bonhoeffer among the honorees.   But this book is a powerful argument that this man, who saw the need for  religious people to use religion less as a crutch and more as a  transformation, should be included prominently in our intellectual heroes  list.	2000-01-28

We are constantly called upon to buy more and better exotic products, in pursuit of the perfect trade magazine nirvana.  No longer can one just go  to a pleasant locale and just fish--one must be on a five day trip in  Mexican waters aboard a luxury yacht with a ton and a half of electronic  equipment and shiny tackle materials that make graphite seem archaic.    Pier Fishing in California is about a simpler way--fishing from public  piers across the state. Here are simple, inexpensive ways to have a day of  fascinating fishing, without the need for boat, high tech tackle, trawling  motor, or (in the cases of public piers), even a fishing license.  The book  does the job just right--a pier by pier rundown of where to fish, what  you'll catch, how to catch it, and how good the fishing is, usually with a  pier picture.  All &quot;how to&quot; books should be this simple and  useful, and pier fishing is a sport that deserves more attention.  I  suspect if more young people were taken to piers and taught patient  technique rather than taken on expensive charters and taught how big money=  easy fishing, then we might generate more young people with a genuine love  for the sport.	1999-12-21

Long before the internet showed us that conventional record  companies will become superfluous to independent artists, the Residents and  Ralph Records were demonstrating that a sense of humor, a sardonic  marketing sensibility, and a willingness to title records &quot;Duck  Stab&quot; could provide the artist outside the grooves with an  audience  and a place in the music industry.  Shirley &quot;plays along&quot; a bit  with the band's &quot;mystery persona&quot; (not to worry, enough hints are  dropped), but this book is not a mere puff piece on the Residents.  Shirley  has a good grip on what works in the Residents' music, and a reasonably  fair criticism of what does not work for him.  The real story is how the  Residents got exposure,and became counterculture icons in their own right,  while consistently parodying the counterculture they eventually came to  symbolize.  If you are a Residents fan, you will like this book, but this  book is also a good read for the person with little Residents  exposure--it's a good example of how &quot;performance art&quot; was a  finely refined art long before MFA dropouts subjected us to one-person  confessional plays about dysfunctional suburban families.  If you dread the  usual &quot;gee, I love U2&quot; fan bio, but like stories about how DIY  artists actually did do it themselves (rather than merely bewail society's  failure to recognize them), you'll like this one.	1999-12-21

Each system has its own strengths, and  drawbacks, and the problem with playing the Closed Sicilian is that while  white has a fairly clear plan, black's plan in the main lines is also  fairly straightforward.  This book is quite helpful, because it goes beyond  &quot;what is the main idea&quot; into &quot;how will one actually play a  game against best play&quot;.   The problem with coverage of the Closed  Sicilian in most works is that the author tends to give a line or two  against each of the major black systems, but little analysis is done of  multiple white alternative lines.  King's book excels in going further than  the usual Closed Sicilian book, by offering detailed chapters on move 6  alternatives for white other than the &quot;main line&quot;.  I like that,  in addition to playing the &quot;main line for white&quot; set forth, King  also shows how to play less favored lines which nonetheless offer white the  chance to maintain initiative with somewhat quieter play.  The text is  based on playing through games in the variations, but unlike some books,  King does not just throw a game at us as if to say &quot;so there&quot;,  but rather provides detailed thematic commentary.  I am a lesser player of  low 1700s USCF, and I found the commentary entirely useful.  I am not sure  it would be as useful for, say a 1300, but I still recommend this book to  any player who wants a system against the Sicilian but has never been able  to get the bang from the Closed Sicilian that, say, Spassky did &lt;g&gt;.	1999-12-15

This book avoids falling into this trap through a  simple, unadorned style that makes us feel as though Michael Adams is a  person who became a grandmaster, rather than some monolithic genius of  chess above common humanity.  The book uses games and brief discussion to  take us from Adams' childhood early folly at the game up until he breaks  through into the GM ranks.  We get a sense of prodigy, hard work, and of a  supportive dad.  Is there much more we need from this type of book?	1999-12-09

Fishes of Arkansas is a visual treat--a species by species documentation of the incredible diversity of freshwater fish found  in that state's streams and waterways.  Arkansas is an inland state, so one  might imagine that a fish survey would document only a narrow array of  green and brown game fish, of little interest to those outside the bait and  hook hobbies.  Fishes of Arkansas demonstrates instead the incredible  biodiversity found in the numerous fish species located in Arkansas.  Here  are pictures of gorgeous fish, large and small, including many of intense  beauty and tremendous color.  The darter section of the book, featuring  many species endemic not only to Arkansas but in many cases to a single  river in Arkansas, shows the reader spectacular, unforgettable fish.  The  narrative is simple and straightforward--each entry is a separate species,  usually with a picture.  The grouping is organized by family, and the  authors provide judicious use of light explanatory and summation material  to tie the individual entries together.  If you need something on your  coffee table or shelves which is light, pleasant picture-filled reading but  not fluff, try Fishes of Arkansas.	1999-12-07

While in War and Peace or Anna Karenina the characters came face to face with the imponderable issues of life--the &quot;big questions&quot;--those novels  did not dwell exclusively on the problems of evil, salvation and the  challenges of redemption in the way that Resurrection does.  Resurrection  presents us with an intensely introspective, guilt-ridden protagonist  hunting that most elusive prize: spiritual salvation, or even its lesser  consolation: a little peace of mind.  The reader is treated to finely drawn  characters and an intense sense of place, of social milieu, and of the  dilemma of finding personal justice in a deeply unjust world.  Although the  work is anything but comic, it has an intensely comic passage about the  problem in making reparations to people who cannot imagine that one would  give up one's property to do so.  If you love the complexity of Tolstoy,  and you do not mind a book that looks deeply within a character, you'll  love Resurrection.  It is interesting to contrast the theme of personal  guilt in this work with its treatment in Crime and Punishment, and this  book holds particular interest if you wish to compare the worldviews of the  novels of Tolstoy with those of Dostoevsky.	1999-12-07

The book stands alone fairly well, but the story will seem tremendously better placed into context if the reader has  read the earlier book, Dawn.   Ms. Butler creates yet another of her dystopian earths, but its final  crisis is ameliorated by the intervention of an alien species, the oankali.  The book tells a crackling good story, but also addresses a key theme--what  does it mean to be human?  I recommend this book, as it has the  old-fashioned virtues of a golden age work, but is told in the fine,  well-written style that characterizes Octavia Butler's work.  Reading a  Butler, one gets the impression that one is watching a grandmaster writing  in her prime--and yet, the nice thing about reading her is the sense that  the best is yet to come.  If you have not read Butler, but you are afraid  that sci fi has lost its zing, then read Dawn and this one.	1999-12-07

He does not try to make up frothy generalities about  the theory, recognizing that the different variations can lead to very  different treatments subject to case-by-case analysis.  I am a B player,  who found this book both easy to use and substantive.  The Alekhine is a  fun, quirky and very complex opening.  I added it back to my blitz arsenal  after reading this book.	1999-12-04

Snow skillfully illustrates to us the politics of small groups, and how very different those politics are  from politics in a broader sense.  This book is one of the Strangers and  Brothers series, but it reads very nicely as a stand-alone work.  The  Masters is a good read, in which we follow the partisan manuvering of two  factions seeking different candidates in the school election.  Snow's style  is straightforward, almost a latter-day Trollope, and his ideas are very  insightful.  This is a classic, which deserves to be more read.	1999-12-04

Among any particular group of low-rated players, a high percentage in any community tend to play either the opening that the world  champion is playing (such as the mid 1970s, when every 'D' rated player  wanted to play the Najdorf Sicilian Poison Pawn variation) or what the  local experts and masters play (in one community, the Goring Gambit and  Smith-Morra Gambit were considered well-nigh a forced win by a local strong  player, resulting in a world of people playing who should have been content  with the Colle System or the Bird variation to the Ruy Lopez).<br />Wincor's  book is a classic of teaching the chess player to march to the tune of a  different drummer.  The style is light, humorous, and aimed less at  describing intricate variations than at giving ideas on a new way to play.   Wincor's suggested style is &quot;baroque&quot;, a deviation from the wild  tactics of the e pawn beginner or the boring oversolidity of the 1. d4 2.  c4 player.  <br />The influence of this book filters through amateur chess  even today, as a minority of fun-seeking explorers move into the B ratings  using the odd but very workable ideas contained herein.  In the same way  that surrealism eventually filtered into mainstream MTV videos, a good day  at the Internet Chess Club or any local chess club will net baroque  players, who used to be a rarity. Still, second only to Koltanowski's Colle  System book, and a nose ahead of Soltis' book setting forth a  Slav/Caro-Kann defensive system, this is a book which can help a D player  become a B player, and help an E player move towards C.

Tony Kosten's Philidor book filled some important gaps, and certainly  should not have fallen out of print.  This is worth tracking down through  the out of print service, for those who enjoy defending and closing  positions down and don't enjoy learning Sicilian and Ruy variations.  With  this opening and a King's Gambit system, one essentially is ready for 1.  e4.   This opening is no longer as neglected as it once was, but still  poses a fun weapon for ICC and swiss players, as most of our amateur  opponents know only the few &quot;easy kill&quot; variations, and are not  able to navigate the opening against the most basic variations set out in  this book.  Mr. Kosten's style is easy and clear--this book's a keeper.	1999-10-04

Authors fill the shelves, as they have for a dozen decades, with endless  sagas of how they climbed-a-mountain-and-everybody-died, why they  sailed-the-Pacific-in-a-sea-of-storms, and even  all-the-good-reasons-why-people-should-not-do-the-dangerous-pastime-the-author-does.<br />&quot;Into  a Desert Place&quot; features many of the hallmarks of this unfortunate  genre of &quot;we nearly died&quot; non-fiction.  Baja California's alien  landscapes, spiked with impassable mountains, rattlesnakes and boojum  trees, certainly qualifies in many regions as a &quot;need a sense of high  adventure and a contempt for danger to tour there&quot; area.  Yet,  &quot;Into a Desert Place&quot; does not repel in the way that &quot;body  count on Mount Everest&quot; books can. On the contrary, this book simply  charms. &quot;Into a Desert Place&quot; is a complete revelation--an  accessible, winning account of how adverse conditions can be met by those  most basic values--determination, a good attitude and, indeed, a good  heart.<br />Mr. Mackintosh manages to convey the hardships of the trip, the  kindness of most of the people he met along the way, and his own struggles  to complete his quest, all without undue sentimentality or boastfulness.   The book has a folksy, simple feel about it, but it is anything but a  simple book.  Instead of the usual travel book conceits based on machismo  or &quot;sheer pluck&quot;, we see Baja through the eyes of Everyman.  We  need more books like &quot;Into a Desert Place&quot; and fewer books about  how many innocent tourists drowned at sea.   We all belong in the desert  place to which this book removes us.  After reading this book, the reader  may not wish to walk around Baja, but the reader might well wish to find  that place of quiet, and think a bit.	1999-09-20

Susan Minot's Folly makes a courageous try, aided by a sparse, unemphatic prose style.   Ms. Minot's prose style underscores the sharp contrast between the spare  passages and her rare flights into extended fantasy or metaphor. <br />The  plot commences in 1917, leading us through a few decades in the life of a  Boston well-to-do woman. The &quot;real story&quot;, as so often is the  case, is the effect of the social milieu upon all its denizens.  Although  in &quot;social content&quot; Folly brings to mind the novels of Edith  Wharton, it must be said that Ms. Minot is unwilling to draw the simple  solutions to the social issues she raises that Ms. Wharton might have  painted two generations ago.  No swift damnations come to those who people  this novel merely as a result of their station, nor is easy salvation to be  found in flight to a more &quot;free&quot; way of life.  Instead, the story  is laced with a pleasing ambiguity--perhaps an escape is possible, but the  exits are not clearly marked.<br />&quot;Literary fiction&quot;, that sad  refugee of obscure collegiate publications, has evolved into a stylized  genre no more aesthetically pleasing (and a good bit less entertaining)  than, say, science fiction or a well-crafted mystery. Ms. Minot can justly  be accused of writing a version of the &quot;MFA litmag&quot; novel, yet  she shows the form is not without its virtues.  The near-gamesmanship with  which she crafts each sentence to achieve studied, quiet precision in her  style and ideas makes this story eminently readable and in its own way  quite evocative. One might not wish for the slow, gentle satire and complex  despair of Folly in every novel one reads, but Folly is certainly worth the  effort.   Ms. Minot's work, though bearing the stigmata of &quot;literary  fiction&quot;, suggests that practitioners of this dour form can resurrect  interest by placing precise execution of a worthwhile plot first, and  saving the &quot;cute&quot; turns of phrase and wails of despair for the  literary seminars.  Although not everyone will like Folly, it is very  satisfying for those who wish a &quot;good read&quot; with a modern  sensibility.	1999-09-15

Anthony Trollope spends so much time doing the things that well-meaning creative writing profesors now tell one never to do--his editorial voice peppers each novel, he avoids subtle foreshadowing in favor of telling you  essentially what will happen next, and he consistently drives plot towards  a theme.  Yet Trollope, a consummate Victorian, seems intrinsically modern  whereas many more &quot;literarily correct&quot; modern humorists grow  antique in a week or less.  The secret, of course, is character, an eye and  an ear for class distinctions, and a skewering wit combined with tremendous  fellow-feeling for the foibles of his characters.  Miss MacKenzie contains  much of Trollope at his best--the title character is a beautifully observed  genteel poor spinster-to-be suddenly visited with the misfortune of  fortune. The author assiduously exposes flaw after flaw in Miss MacKenzie  and her social milieu, and yet we like her better for the harsh light.  In  this world of tremendous unkindness, it is nice to remember that one can be  honest without being brutal.  Trollope, a writer of genial works of whimsy,  brings the quiet honesty of literary fiction home safely here.	1999-04-24

Theoreticians seek to dissect its systems and strategems into elaborate cosmologies--a rational world of &quot;right moves&quot; and &quot;forced wins&quot;.  Computers  hum mercilessly, hanging (to paraphrase a song) the chess angels from the  gallows of science.  The opening moves of the game are elaborately named,  studied at length, categorized and data-based.  To the uninitiated, chess  can seem like a frightening orthodoxy, determined to force the creativity  of the winner and the folly of the loser into rigid, almost moralistic  rationalism.<br />Unorthodox Chess Openings reminds us that not only is chess  a game, but it is a game of endless sideroads and frightening stray beauty.   For every &quot;good&quot; strategem, artlessly constructed like workers'  housing in a communist state, there are innumerable &quot;weird&quot;  strategies, furtively appearing in blitz chess games and the epic matches  of the fourth tier player.  We who play such openings live in a gnosis in  which the experience of the game counts more than whether a particular  opening grants long-lasting salvation. <br />It's a daunting task, writing  about openings which grandmasters don't respect and devotees worship. But  Schiller handles the task well.  He patiently explains the virtues and  flaws in each offbeat opening.  He never loses sight of the fact that those  of us who play the esoteric are seeking not only literal truth of  &quot;correct play&quot; but also the truth of fun and the inner spirit  which is the heart of the game.  The book has only minor flaws. Some  opening strategems which are frequently played but quite unorthodox could  receive greater attention, while some very unorthodox but extremely rarely  played openings receive a good bit of attention.  No doubt some lines will  require different attention in the next edition.<br />Mr. Schiller's style is  clear, concise, and  straightforward.  The book can be comfortablyread by  anyone from beginner to my OTB &quot;B&quot; rating level, and I suspect  that anyone shy of master category could find wonderful blitz and bullet  weapons there.<br />We need more books about the joy of chess, and fewer  writings about how people wish to stifle the game in mazes of misbegotten  politics and misplaced engineering.<br />As an Internet Chess Club player, I  find  Unorthodox Chess Openings an essential blitz weapon.  If it is not  the fully comprehensive work that one might hope, this  is because Mr.  Schiller has done as much as he can in one book with such a broad  subject--the rest should be left to the more courageous monographer on an  opening by opening basis.  <br />If you wish to take a first step to reclaim  chess from the hegemony of &quot;correct play&quot;, you might try buying  this book.  I know I can speak with  equanimity on this point--I like the  book very much even though it contains my own decisive defeat in the  esoteric Guatemala Defense.<br />I hope you enjoy this reference as much as I  have.	1999-04-02

CP Snow tackled the &quot;big topics&quot;.  These books begin an eleven novel cycle, using as a focal point a provincial Englishman of humble origin who works his way up the  rungs of law, into academia, and finally into government.  These novels  trace the narrator, Lewis Elliot, from his early small town days through  his first entry into academia.  Snow's style is easy, deliberate, and  narrative--these books are not &quot;experimental&quot; in any sense, but  instead are a &quot;good read&quot; in the best old-fashioned sense.  Have  you ever wished for books with both good plots and artistic merit? Then you  must begin here.  Snow understood a lot about us--that sometimes the most  brilliant personalities are not the most successful, that the politics of  small groups and the politics of large groups are entirely different, and  that both faith and love have odd play with those whom they possess from  time to time, and in Strangers and Brothers he spins his themes out  well....I highly recommend.	1999-02-26

Ms. Loh undeniably writes with a crisp, witty style.  At her best, she can be a real pleasure to read.  This novel is far from her best.  It's the old problem--how does one write about the sheer banality of fame and  self-expression without seeming hopelessly banal oneself (i.e., merely  stylistically banal, and not endearingly, wittily droll)?  Ms. Loh does not  solve the problem. Here we are treated to all the &quot;usual  suspects&quot; of LA pop culture as we've seen them in dozens of novels and  indie films for decades--the &quot;poor me&quot; suburban artiste, the  &quot;gosh what does our desire for fame do to us&quot; couple, the  &quot;things are pretty darn artificial and plastic among people who want  to be paid huge sums of money to share their creative musings&quot; riffs.   I suppose that because Ms. Loh writes beautifully and has a fine sense of  humor, I kept wishing she had something to say....but every time I kept  wishing for a bit of spiritual epiphany, or perhaps even a little common  humanity, I perceived instead another  cliche or cheap shot joke. It's a  bit like listening to Celine Dion sing--the voice may be golden, but the  words should be parked across the street someplace.  While one might  suggest that Ms. Dion try a better lyricist (somebody with a truly  spiritual streak or at least a wicked sense of humor--Bill Nelson, Ron  Mael&lt;g&gt;?), it is difficult to know what to suggest to Ms. Loh.  One  can't help but wonder (not only as to this novel, but in other contexts as  well) if this great comic gift might not be better used in pursuit of  something a little less mean-spirited. As for the reader, I suggest you  read instead Depth Takes a Holiday, her much more effective collection from  her Buzz Magazine days.  Sandra Tsing Loh may have a real novel in her  someday, but this one is not that novel.	1999-02-26

Miss Read's novels capture the best aspects of the small town provincial novel--the sense of connection, the wry Austenisms--while leaving the sentimentality and pollyanna-ism sometimes afflicting the genre to her  lesser imitators.  A Peaceful Retirement brings us another step--perhaps a  final step--nearer to the end of this series.  I recommend this series, and  this book within the series, to anyone who wishes that a novel might have  both a 20th C. awareness and a somewhat 19th C. sense of  perspective....Most people have not discovered Miss Read, and one somehow  wonders if &quot;most people&quot; really ought to.
