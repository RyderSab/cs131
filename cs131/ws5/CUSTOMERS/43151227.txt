This is the best of hers that I have read so far. It only took me two days to read the entire book, which usually says a lot for me.<BR><BR>It will be a bit hard to really say much about the story without giving anything away, but let's just say Temple Gault is at it again and he is worse than you have ever imagined. If you do not know who Temple Gault is, he is a serial killer that was introduced in the last two books, Cruel and Unusual and The Body Farm. You will want to read those before you jump into From Potter's Field.	2002-04-06

In this book, Alex Cross is up against the 'Weasel', a serial killer who pretty much is involved in a Role Playing Game and is playing the Game out in real life. It is an interesting twist and a somewhat new idea, but too many of the themes in the book remind me of past books in this series (I don't want to get into too much detail, so I don;t spoil the book for you).	2002-04-06

It took me forever to read this book, because there was not much suspense for me since it was all in pretty much the usual pattern. This time we are dealing with bank robbers of the most brutal kind and a mastermind behind this robberies. Also, Janie falls ill in this installment and Alex Cross finds a new romantic interest. Unfortunately, the book gives us not much closure at all but sets us up for the sequel. I guess either Mr. Patterson is getting very greedy or he had a deadline to meet.	2002-04-06

Well, he could not have been any more wrong. The Alphabet series is a wonderful series of books and I have read A through H at this point and will continue until I get to the end. <BR><BR>This time, Kinsey gets involved in investigating claims to an insurance company that seem fraudulent and she ends up infiltrating an insurance fraud gang as a result. It is Kinsey Millhone and Sue Grafton at their best. Don't Miss it! I loved it.	2002-04-06

This one took me quite a bit longer to complete. The story was allright and had a lot of potential, but I got a bit confused at times with all the different villains to keep track off. My biggest problem though was that I could not relate to any of the lead characters. I think the book could have been a lot better if I did.	2002-04-06

This time the majority of the novel is set in the Mountains of North Carolina, where a young girl named Emily Steiner has disappeared and was found murdered. It seems Temple Gault is the perpetrator of this foul deed. However, as the story unfolds and more bodies are found, other suspects emerge. Also, Lucy, Kay Scarpetta's niece, now a Senior at UVA and an intern at the FBI facility in Quantico, runs into quite a bit of trouble with the law. On top of the thrilling nature of the story, Patricia Cornwell also complicates the personal lives of our protagonists Scarpetta and Marino. If you like Scarpetta, don' miss this one. If you haven't read any of the books in the series, then start with cruel an unusual, because it leads into this one.	2002-04-03

The book is fast paced and Patterson managed to get me so involved in te book that I was worried sick about the fate of Alex Cross's niece. I was impressed with the quick pace and the fact that I breezed through the novel within one day. Also Patterson managed to lead me on as to who the perpetrators were and had me fooled almost to the end. This is one of Patterson's best books. Unfortunatley he has run out of steam somewhat on the Alex Cross series. The later books in the series are not that good.	2002-04-03

Patterson reveals who Mr. Smith is, with about 150 pages to go and then the entire thrill of the novel is gone. <BR> The case of Gary Soneji does carry the book.

F is for Fugitive is in my opinion the best book in the Kinsey Millhone series. By the way, I have read A through F so far. In this book, our protagonist leaves the usual setting of Santa Teresa and travels to Floral Beach, a small town, where she is hired to solve a murder that happened seventeen years ago. She quickly untangles a web of emotions and hatred between different characters. It seems like both Kinsey and the reader are in the dark about the events that occured seventeen years ago until we are about 75 percent done with the book. Don't miss this one. It is a first-rate mystery.	2001-08-26

Jack &amp; Jill is the the second James Patterson book I have read, the first being along came a spider. Although I liked Along came a spider just a little bit better Jack and Jill is still an absolutely amazing book. The story starts out with the murder of a US senator and the murder of a little girl in the southeastern quadrant of DC. Once again, our hero and protagonist Alex Cross is called upon to serve these murders. It does not take long for a shocking story to unfold that will chill and thrill you to the bone. Once again, James Patterson shows us that he is a master of the thriller genre. He gives us just enough information to let our own imagination to start going down the most shocking twists and turns. Don't miss this book. It is well worth your time and $$$.	2001-08-25

For about 380 of the 400 pages, it is a real page turner. In the second book in the Paul Madriani series, our hero ends up being the District Attorney of Davenport county, a small rural county in which several serial murders have been committed. When the killer is caught, Madriani feels there is another murderer, probably a copycat at work. From there the book keeps a steady pace and the pages begin to turn themselves until about page 380. Then, all of a sudden Steve Martini must have either run out of steam, or maybe he just wanted to get the book over with. The end seems unbelievable and just comes too quickly. Still worth reading though.	2001-08-21

This is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read, and I am sure it won't be my last. Cornwell tells the story of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the Virgina Chief Medical Examiner who investigated the murder of Beryl Madison, a young author who was recently brutally murdered. Scarpetta quickly becomes entangled in a web of murder and intrigue. <br />What I like most about Cornwell, is that she seems most knowledgeable on the subject matter at hand. She has definitely worked as a police officer and at the Medical Examiners office before, and her familiarity with those fields clearly shine through in the book. Additionally, her decription of various places seem very accurate, especially Key West. From her depiction of events/places in the Keys I know she has been there before and it took me back in my mind to an island i absolutely love. <br />I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did !	2001-08-14

'Along Came a Spider' is the first book I read by James Patterson, and I promise you, it will not be the last. The main hero of our book is Alex Cross, a Black detective and psychologist who lives and works in the Southeastern quadrant of Washington D.C. He is called in by the FBI to assist in solving the kidnapping of two children. At first Alex is angered that he is taken away from his usual job, but soon gets involved in the kidnapping at every level. Honestly, so will you. <br />'Along came a Spider' is extremely powerful.

All of a sudden the plot evolves into a search for the lost journals of Francis Drake as well as trying to solve a murder that is 30 years past. Martini just fails to build a believable chain of events. Again, don't waste your time with this book.

Bobby believes the accident was an attempt to kill him, because of a secret he knows. Unfortunately, Bobby suffers from amnesia because of the accident ad cannot remember what the secret was. Our friend Kinsey quickly takes a liking to him, but unfortunatley Bobby meets an untimely end. Now it is up to Kinsey to find out who is behind his death and what the horrible secret is...<br />Once again, Sue Grafton portrays Kinsey as the odd yet likeable person that she is.

The story is based on fact from Wiesenthals life. Many famous people wrote essays, which are printed in the back of the book, arguing wether to forgive him or not.

Kinsey is a 32 rear-old PI, twice divorced with no kids. She lives in a garage/apartment and drives an old battered VW beetle. <br />At the beginning of the book, Kinsey is hired by Nikkie Fife, who had spent 8 years in prison for murdering her husband and is now out on Parole. Nikkie wants to know who really did it. In the course of her investigation, Kinsey uncovers more murders, and seems to be always just one step behind the true killer.<br />I like Sue Grafton's style of writing. Throughout the majority of the book, both the reader and Kinsey are pretty much in the dark about the true identity of the killer. Along with our protagonist we race down every little chamber of our minds trying to determine the course of events and 'Who did it'. It is only until the very end until Grafton sheds light on this for us. And what an ending it is! If you like mysteries, pick this one up. You won't regret it.	2001-07-27

Resolved to clear up the mystery surrending his father's murder, he moves to Switzerland and begins work for the United Swiss bank. Here he is soon involved in the intrigue and corruption that sorround the bank and its activities.<br />Personally, I was excited when I discovered Numbered Account. I had always been intrigued by the Swiss Banking System as well as Wall Street, etc. Christopher Reich does a good job describing the banking system. However, the story leaves a bit too be desired. At times the plot just drags too much, and when I finally made it towards the end of the book, the events do not seem to flow logically. Also, there a few loose ends that Reich never clears up. Oh, well! The book is an entertaining read, though, but it's just too long!	2001-07-26

We then jump ahead 25 years and are taken through several flashbacks. This style of writing takes a bit getting used to, because the constant flashbacks make it a bit hard to keep track of the sequence of events. Nevertheless, Puzo covers several topics in this book, such as the struggle between the two young men, struggle between generations and he also introduces us to the corrupt world of Hollywood as well as to the difficulty of raising an autistic child.
