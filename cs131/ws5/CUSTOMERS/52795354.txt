I didn't have a problem with the use of a similar &quot;world&quot; to other vampire mythologies.  What I didn't really care for in this book was an entirely different issue:  the writing.<br />The novel reads like a screenplay that was badly adapted to novel form.  There's lots of dialogue, and sometimes it can be a little irritating in its attempt to be &quot;street cool.&quot;  But even that I could handle if there was more about the characters that I was interested in, or even liked.  I found it hard to be sympathetic or care about the major characters because I just didn't know enough about them, about their world, about their past.  What description I did get was sometimes a bit trite-- the Latino drug dealer chock-full-of machismo, for example, was not really a new take on an old stereotype.<br />Long ago, in my fiction writing class, we discussed the concept of beginning a story &quot;in medias reas&quot;  or &quot;in the middle of things.&quot;  The first section of the book starts this way-- right in the middle of an action scene, and this could be cool for, say, a movie where much of the &quot;description&quot; is obvious from set design, costuming, actor emotion, etc.  But sometimes the descriptions here are so sketchy that I will miss an important action because I didn't &quot;hear&quot; that as happening, and have to read back to see what happened.  (Like when one character gets &quot;vamped&quot; I still wasn't sure what was happening at first and had to skim back a page).  Then, in other spots, the description goes on and on and rambles to the point where I skim to get to a part that hasn't been covered already, or gives me new info.  As far as it being a scary book-- no.  I didn't find it gripping or &quot;horror&quot; like at all.<br />This book, and the series, has a lot of potential.  There were moments where I got interested, and if the whole series was in one novel, I would keep reading to see what happens.  But I'm not interested enough in the story at this point to invest the money in more sequels.  I might check the books out at a library, but I am not committed enough to the &quot;world&quot; of these slayers to buy the books yet.<br />If you're the type who needs to read everything there is related to vampires, or like your description kept to a bare minimum, this is an okay book.  But I did end up feeling pretty disappointed in what could have been a great idea.There were moments where I got interested, and if the whole series was in one novel, I would keep reading to see what happens.

Ellen Ripley	Books	5	12	15	N	N	A major contribution to both academia and fandom	Gallardo &amp; Smith have written a work that *will be* one of *the* most important books ever for scholars AND fans of the Aliens series of films. This serious and thought-provoking, clearly-written work is immanently readable at the same time as it is insightful and rigorously scholarly. It will promote greater academic understanding of science-fiction and feminism (together and as discrete studies) and those who read it will want to own it, reference it, and read it for sheer pleasure again and again.<br />The study examines the entire story arc of four movies that made us gasp and wonder, and made us re-examine science fiction not only as more than just &quot;bug eyed monsters against the good GUYS&quot;  but also as reflections of the historical era from which each film arose.  This seriously well-researched and well documented work traces the history of the movie's compelling images, (for example, giving us &quot;ah ha&quot; moments about the inspiration for the films' artwork, facts that I know I never knew about the reason for the Aliens' form).  It gives us intricate close-readings of each film, examining scene after scene with insight and depth, and helps us understand the metaphors of Corporate space and humanity in a post-human era.<br />One of my favorite parts is the close-reading of Ripley's suicidal leap in Aliens 3, and I had to gloat as Gallardo &amp; Smith reveal the background meanings and imagery of her strongly compelling act of grasping the newborn alien bursting from her chest.  I was delighted when I realized that my own feelings watching the film for the first time were right (I knew it!) and had that comfortable feeling you get when having a great conversation with people who share your passion for interesting works of cultural significance.<br />Never a &quot;publish or perish,&quot; jargon-laden ivory-tower read, this work is compelling and fun, at the same time that it contributes important scholarship to a pivotal science fiction franchise and science fiction studies in general.  If you are a fan of the series, but not an academic, you will still love this book, and learn something new and worthwhile about your favorite sci-fi.  If you are an academic looking for rigorous critical interpretation, you will also find what you are looking for.<br />A must read for fans, scholars, and anyone interested in the &quot;post-human&quot; subject and Ripley's compelling character.

This book has not disappointed me, although I admit I would keep reading the series even if it did (for a sense of completion, at least).  This is probably King's \\"magnum opus\\"-- the writing which I believe he must feel defines his career and guarantees him a place in literary history.  I can say that I haven't loved every one of his books--but I have loved every one of them in this series-- including this one.<br />Like the \\"third from the end\\" book it is, it does NOT answer any final questions.  It's a stepping stone to an end, one that I still cannot predict (that makes me happy).  I am anxious to move along on the beam to the next story, the next waystation with the ka-tet.  But for now, I rest satisfied that this book was worth reading.<br />The book ties contemporary literature and more of King's work into Roland's world, delightfully so in many spots.  The places where King most artfully mixes a popular culture reference of some sort are the ones that make me look most forward to the next books-- I want to know where he's going with this trend, because for now, I don't see it.  There is enough \\"backstory\\" so that if it's been a while since you read the last books in the series, you don't have to go back (although it's a pleasure to do so). But you won't be lost wondering \\"when did that happen?\\" and yet you won't be frustrated reading TOO MUCH recap (which happens in a lot of series books, too.)<br />The illustrations were an interesting touch I didn't remember from the past books till I looked at them again-- I'm not exactly sure what their purpose is, but I am not against them.  I would and will read this book again-- and I am glad that King has finally come to the beginning of the end in the series upon which I have followed him over 20 years (since I was barely Jake's age, myself!).	2003-11-19

It's more like savoring something that tastes really good-- you don't want to gobble it all down right away, and it's really so rich that if you did consume it too fast, you'd regret it afterwards.  The book is not at all a fast-paced action book.  Hollywood would certainly never make a movie out of it, for example.  But you grow to love the characters, and there is a long time for you to come to know them well.<br />The tone is mythic-- at times it feels like you're reading a book written in the 1900's, but it is also truly modern.  Once you get to the end and find out the circular nature of the story, and the way it blends its &quot;ordinary people&quot; characters into fantasy and faerie, you'll be amazed at the power of a &quot;slow&quot; novel to really dig deeply into your memory.<br />There is a tendency for some folks to think &quot;fantasy&quot; is only the stuff read by teens &amp; is not &quot;literary.&quot;  The fantasy epic, however, goes as far back as Spencer's Faerie Queen-- which this novel, in some ways, owes a debt to.  It's truly worthy of being classed in the &quot;canon&quot; of great literature-- but I don't think it will be-- like one of its main characters, the novel is strangely anonymous among readers who OUGHT to know about it.  Fans of fantasy as a genre ought to read this book, but then, so should classics fans and literary novel fans.  Read this book, and see the way myth and history blend together.	2003-02-10

We know the scenario by heart-- in a near-death experience, the person floats over their body, sees a brightly lit tunnel, meets loved ones, is often pulled back abruptly into themselves with a renewed feeling of purpose.<br />This book begins with this idea, then wonders, what if?  What else happens?  What about if you could simulate the Near Death experience in a controlled environment, and figure out what exactly is going on physiologically so that every culture seems to have these similar experiences?<br />There are some fabulous moments in this book, and a few that I didn't feel met the potential.  When the participants in the research study begin to quit, I imagined a sinister reason that never really panned out to my satisfaction (there is an explanation, I just thought it was less fulfilling than I'd hoped.)  One really good element is the \\"last words\\" at the beginning of each chapter-- they make you really think about what happens to people when they die-- once we get around the traditional religious and cultural assumptions, what does the body/person feel?  What causes this?<br />But the reason this book gets four, rather than five, stars, is that the climax of the book seemed to come about halfway through, then the rest (200 pages or so) felt like an too slow \\"denouement\\" that just went on and on and on and on.  I wanted the story to wrap up-- and it took too long for it to happen.  Since I'm a really fast reader, I was sort of okay, but my husband, who reads more slowly & deliberately, was bogged down a bit.<br />Still, it's a good book, and other Connie Willis works are really worth your time.  They are all thought-provoking, the characters are likable and usually fairly well-rounded, and the ideas quite interesting.  I also love the \\"pop culture\\" references throughout the book-- since I'm kind of a \\"quote movies & books\\" nerd in regular conversation, I love it when an author does this too.	2002-07-17

This one, however, does not have the problems of the others.  You, gentle reader, will be instantly sucked into the story line, interested in the story's complications, like the characters, and want to stay up all night (I did till 2 am) to finish.<br />Well-researched elements of Victorian society are included, but the piece does not become a parody of Victorian lit.  There's enough for a laugh and a smile of recognition, but the book remains thouroughly for the modern reader, while not making fun of the elements of Victorian.<br />Ultimately a fantasy/mystery story, you will smile when you learn \\"whodunit\\" in every case.<br />In an episode of Star Trek with Captain Janeway, she once commented on how she hated those \\"time travel paradox\\" scenarios and had vowed to never get into one.  This book has that time traveller's dilemna-- what are the things you're doing while in the past affecting in the future?  How does even the smallest detail affect the way the world will be?  And what if you, time traveller, are the real reason for things going right/wrong?<br />A worthwhile, rewarding use of your time.  Truly a fabulous  book that will both keep you guessing, laughing, and feeling that you got to know a new place and new people who you will treasure.	2002-07-17

You've ever studied feminism-- you're interested in how women's fantasy-life works, you are a woman, you are a man who wants to understand women (or not), you think that perhaps you need a new man/woman in your life to complete you, you need to be completed by yourself, you think maybe you're crazy but aren't sure the therapist is working.... you have these long, detailed fantasies about.....<br />This book, considered a consciousness-raising classic of the second wave of feminism by some and smut by others (as the author discusses in the intro), is well-written, analyzes some of the best parts of an individual (who happens to be a budding \\"lady writer\\")and who discovers herself (quite accidentally in some ways). It does have some rather strongly worded fantasies-- and one could probably go on for days about the *potentials* of the ZF (and not look at the pool guy/girl the same way again)-- but in all, it's truly a story about identity, the truth behind our fantasies, and how a woman of the 1970's era (and unfortunately for our progress, today too) sometimes gets by (or fails to) in life.<br />I enjoyed the first half immensely, found myself skimming a little in the middle part (not as gripping because it was painful to witness) and was interested enough by the end to want to know what happened after the book's last page ended. So give it a go-- and when you see the rest of us in elevators smirking, you might wonder why.	2002-07-15

I do find the idea of whether the League would not figure out the \\"non-sentient\\" practice of dumping off people on a hostile planet to get rid of them a bit \\"off\\" (if they even know when you intend to kill, wouldn't they know what the Admirality was up to, and want to stop it?) I also am not sure about the practice of picking the unattractive to be expendable-- Festina is genetically engineered to have a big old birthmark that makes her troublesome and therefore expendable.  These are potentially interesting ideas that could be explored to great effect-- and at first, I thought Gardner was going to really wow me.  But the last half of the book does end with more of a whimper than a bang-- and I don't think that anyone really grows or changes, least of all the Earth folks who don't have to take responsibility for what they've been doing.<br />It's a good, quick read, and don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it.  But what sci fi does best is take an already existing condition and make us think about it in a new way that changes some of us... and I think what this book does more of is reinforce things we already know about ourselves without really questioning the big underlying assumptions.  The human race can be big jerks sometimes-- so what does the humble explorer do about it?	2002-07-15

Kingsolver loves her subject matter-- she falls in love with the land, the characters, the storyline.  And in the process, the words she writes resonate with that special glow with which you see someone/thing you love.  As a reader, I too fell for the book's setting &amp; characters.  I wish I could meet them, go there, be this kind of writer.  The story gripped me and would not let go.  Having the luck to also have &quot;read&quot; this on the book on tape version read by Kingsolver herself, I enjoyed it all the more... so if you're a &quot;car reader&quot; like me, give this one a try.

I used to be an &quot;anti-book on tape&quot; snob, thinking that people should &quot;read&quot; books, not listen to them.

It took me a while, though, to get &quot;in&quot; to the book-- I'm not sure why, but it's not a page-turner the way, say, Into Women's Country (another Tepper book) was for me.  But it's definitely a thought-provoker.  What if aliens could come down and change us, whether we wanted them to or not?  What if politicians really had to &quot;perform&quot; the rhetoric that they espouse?  (Put their money where their mouth is)?<br />A good, entertaining, quick read, not too complex, a little simplistic perhaps at times but worthwhile.  If a &quot;4 stars&quot; is a &quot;B&quot; on the A-F scale then my rating gives it about a B+.	2002-03-28

(I'm the one that mentions the astonished Mary over coffee).... The reason I wanted to revisit this review, though, is more than just because I wanted credit.  This book is truly astonishing-- this Christmas, I had it out on the table as part of my holiday decor and the friends & family who looked at it were all delighted.  I think my favorite part is still the same-- the way Vivas illustrates a real looking family with the classic story.  But another thing that is important to me is that she shows Joseph taking active part in his child's nurturing (even if he is technically a \\"stepdad\\").  The illustrations are gorgeous and the text is the classic, poetic King James version.  Love it!	2002-03-15

Gilman was a feminist, a radical suffragist and a woman who was told that all of her thoughts and energies ought to be solely focused on something that she wasn't really interested in being:  a mother.  She suffered from post-partum depression and severe anxiety later in life.  The title story, &quot;the Yellow Wallpaper&quot; is a semi-autobiographical account of what happened when she had to go through a &quot;rest cure&quot; for her &quot;hysteria.&quot;  The title story is her most well-known, but the other writings are very good too, and worth a second look.  She wrote prolifically-- and deserves to be better known.<br />The first time I ever encountered this story was at a dramatic interpretation contest in high school-- and when the girl performing this did her descent into madness, it made the hair crawl on the back of my neck. If you really think about what's going on, you too will be creeped out.	2002-03-15

If you have read it, read it again.  Morrison's prose is so powerfully constructed, so poetic and gorgeous, that it deserves to be one of those books you wear the cover off of.  One of the most difficult sections is the &quot;middle passage&quot; part-- I had no idea what was going on in there, but once I got it, boy did it make sense why Beloved was so angry.<br />This is a classic-- it should be taught with the other Southern books of the canon.  It's definitely on my top 50 list of all time, and it's for the writing, for the plot, for the characters and for the creepy ghost story feeling it gave me in the end.	2002-03-15

The \\"you'll like this book\\" ratings system by our friends here at Amazon really worked for me on this one. After it popping up over & over again on my \\"recommendations\\" page, I bought it on a weekend I needed some \\"FUN\\" reading.  I instantly loved Laurell K. Hamilton's scrappy hero, Anita Blake and bought all the books in the series, devouring them one by one in a matter of weeks.  I then moved on to her other books, and enjoyed them too.<br />Now, they are sometimes a little \\"blush-inducing\\" in the romance department.  Hamilton really catches that \\"attraction/revulsion\\" tradition of the vampire.  You want to like them, and you want to be repelled by them, just as Anita Blake is.  You worry right along with her that the things she does for a living might be affecting her soul.  You don't believe it, but wonder.<br />I think that this is a series well-worth reading.  As a review said, it's like Buffy, but grown up.  I like the feminist touch that appears ever so lightly, and the fact that even when Anita is fighting, she is not always \\"pristine\\" and she gets beat up sometimes-- makes it more realistic than the ones who never even break a nail.	2002-03-15

Is this a feminist manifesto, or something about a certain kind of person?  What is solitude, and what happens when a woman has only so many choices?<br />This text is probably one of the first of the Women's Studies &quot;awakenings&quot;  and as such, is itself an important artifact of feminist theory.  The story itself is sometimes rich and poetic and sometimes frustrating as you can get.  Why does a woman's choice (in the Victorian setting) only amount to such limited options?  Why can't Edna live in the world she wishes?<br />There are some who claim that this book was banned in its author's home-town library-- if you want to know why, you'll have to read it yourself.	2002-03-15

When you first start reading Tarot, people tell you that eventually you will find \\"YOUR\\" deck--the one that suits you perfectly and feels \\"right.\\" While I was in, of all places, New Orleans (a favorite city) I found this deck. I adore everything about the deck. Using Hallowe'en symbolism to represent the classic Tarot elements is a work of incredible \\"rightness.\\" Even though Kipling West substitutes the \\"traditional\\" elements (balls=pumpkins, for example) she still uses appropriately similar Hallowe'en type things that match up with the \\"archetypes.\\"<br />Another great thing about this deck is that even though she uses the Halloween symbols, they are very clearly based on the traditional placements & elements from one of the oldest decks ever-- the Rider Waite Tarot--the one commissioned by the Society of the Golden Dawn over a hundred years ago.  But unlike the Rider Waite-- which many people dislike for being bland and boring, the Halloween Tarot is new and interesting.  Those of you who started with Rider Waite will find a lot of similarity in the decks, but enough difference to make your second Tarot more \\"you\\" and less \\"everyone else.\\"<br />One of my favorite things about this deck is a very personal one-- the cat on every card, who acts as a sort of guide to the emotion/meaning of that card, looks just like my cat, Tituba. So this deck seems to have been made for me.<br />STILL-- even if you aren't lucky enough to have a curly tailed black cat, if you like colorful, vivid Tarot cards which are a little different from the \\"new age\\" style that takes over so many Tarot decks, and if you like a good, bright spread, and if Hallowe'en is one of your favorite holidays, GET THIS DECK.

This book is sometimes frustrating because you, the reader, can see where the plot is going and want so badly to help the story's characters avoid what seems to be the inevitable.  A naturalistic picture of life, and an often-missed text which deserves more attention.  It doesn't make you feel good-- but it does make you want to be sure that people have choices, that this sort of thing isn't allowed to happen, that life isn't a series of \\"sport\\" that the gods (a vindictive type of gods) play with us.  Powerful, powerful writing, vivid details and characters you just want to smack.  Read it!	2002-03-15
US	52795354	RVB82M2IT2U7X	0441008003	666787553	Galveston	Books	5	7	7	N	N	dark Southern fantasy	What I loved about this book was the fact that even though there's a certain Southern Gothic feel to this fantasy, it still didn't leave me feeling sad &amp; depressed, like some of the other dark fantasy writers I've read.  The story-line could use some fleshing out-- I did wonder, as other negative reviewers, what about the other places?  What happened, for instance, to New Orleans-- if the magic of Mardis Gras hit Galveston, whoa nelly, New Orleans!!!  But at the same time, I was drawn into this incredibly well-drawn, deeply satisfying narrative.  I don't think it has anything to do with magic being always &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; as one reviewer seems to imply, but it is always dangeous-- the &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; sort of warning that some folks forget about in the world of Unicorns and happy little fairies.<br />Based on this and several others I have read by him, Sean Stewart is one of those authors whose book I will buy just from seeing his name on the cover-- I don't even have to read the plot blurb, I know I will like it.  You will too if you enjoy a complex look at magic realism with a Southern twist.	2002-03-15

This version of Stowe's classic text includes reproductions of orginal historical documents at the back, literary criticism of the text, and some of the original illustrations.  The book is well-made, stands up to the stress of reading (paper is thin but not too thin, like some anthologies).<br />As for the text-- this is the book that some say caused Abraham Lincoln to write the Emancipation Proclamation.  An \\"Uncle Tom\\" has come to mean a black person who sells out to the white system-- but in so many ways, that is not at all what Uncle Tom does in the book.  Stowe wrote the book to change what she saw as an unjust system, an evil system-- and at times, the text is very didactic (teacherly) and very preachy about religion.  It's a fine \\"sentimental\\" book-- and a fine historical document.  It's also a pretty good story.  Yes, there are some places where we could just get a tooth ache from the syrup of the overly dramatized scenes (you'll see when you read about Little Eva).  But it's a certain style of writing that accomplished Stowe's goal of getting the women who may not have owned slaves but who benefitted from the system (white, northern, wealthy ones) to realize the problems and move to CHANGE them.<br />Much of what people think about Uncle Tom's Cabin actually comes from the later \\"Tom shows\\" that travelled the country-- the minstrel reviews that were not very flattering either to blacks or to Stowe's original texts.  Read the book that has everyone all stirred up and make your own judgements.  You might not like it-- but don't let someone else make the decision for you.	2002-03-15

This novel, written so long ago, still holds a powerful message about race, about social norms, and about the way we try to change the way &quot;the system&quot; works.  You may have read one of the earliest chapters, called &quot;Battle Royale&quot; in a fiction anthology-- and it sets the tone for the rest of the book in many ways.  Watch for repeating themes, images, and ideas that follow throughout.  This is a skillfully crafted story which is also a fast read-- once you really want to see the protagonist's life-story (which happens early on).  A classic of modern American Literature-- clearly you need to read this book to understand where we are today, and where we can go tomorrow.	2002-03-15

I bought it for myself, as an adult, but will someday share it with my kids.  I used to mess up the stories myself for my sister's kids-- they loved it when you made something different from the same old story they'd heard a thousand times.<br />It would be great for kids who have heard the Goldilocks story, and who wonder about the way Goldie seems to get off scott free for tearing up the Bears' house.  I do see the point of those parents who are worried it teaches inappropriate behavior, but I think as one other reviewer pointed out, the fact that an \\"innocent\\" victim ends up suffering the consequenses of the bears' actions is a good lesson to teach.  Definitely don't just leave this book lying around with no discussion of it!  And since the best thing in the world is to read *with* kids, think of the teaching moment you have when the bears have to slink off at the end and the danger they face for not thinking of the possible consequences of their actions.  And, finally, it's just plain funny, and kids love inappropriate humor.<br />I think that a sense of humor is a great thing for all kids to be exposed to at an early age, and the sense that stories aren't just supposed to teach, but sometimes to delight.	2002-03-15

When I read this play, when I heard it performed, I just wanted to make the crazy escalation of events stop.  It seemed so ridiculous that this whole town, these people's lives, depend upon the words of teenaged girls with \\"axes to grind.\\"  It's even more scary when we realize Miller is writing not so much about the Salem witch hunts but about the witch hunts that STILL go on.  How do you defend yourself against an unjust, ungrounded, illogical attack when even the system set up to \\"protect\\" the innocent has an agenda?<br />Miller's writing is probably best experienced in a performed setting-- it's hard to read a play and really \\"get it.\\"  But you should read the text too-- because the language, the beauty and craftsmanship, is sometimes lost in the acting.	2002-03-15

I originally bought this book to give to a friend for a wedding gift, and eventually had to buy it for myself. I traded in a more &quot;famous&quot; trendy cookbook which was not well done for this one and have not looked back.<br />It's both complex enough for experienced cooks and simple-to-follow enough for the beginner-- plus includes some &quot;everyone ought to know this&quot; tips and charts on things other than the nuts and bolts of recipes. Buy this book; you won't regret it, and you're supporting charity work, as well.	2002-03-15

Jacobs was a slave-- and endured unbearable harships to escape the unwanted \\"romantic\\" attentions of her owner and eventually slavery altogether.  Her text, written as an autobiography to prove, in part, that an African American woman could be just as moral and brave as the target audience of white women who were ignoring the slave system as something they had nothing to do with, is a classic of African American literature.  The story is interesting, well-written and sometimes as tense as any dramatic nail-biter.  This is a historical document as much as it is a good read.  This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to know about the US troubled relationship with race, still today and in our past.	2002-03-15

Maybe it takes an understanding of African American literary traditions-- signifying, call &amp; response, etc, to really dig in, but you can still relate without that background.<br />There are multiple layers of narration going on-- and once you can get through those layers, you can both enjoy the story-line and understand something pivotal about the way the African American genre works.  The dialect and speech patterns are represented in a way that was criticized by some early African American writers who wanted a more &quot;realistic&quot; &quot;naturalistic&quot; and political structure.  But underneath the &quot;quaint&quot; nature of the stories about magic &amp; the slave/master relationship are some very subtle and very powerful images of how the slave and master influence *each other*-- that there are differences in the power dynamic than what we expect.  It might be hard to get into the language-- but once you do, it's not overdone.  Read the dialect the way you would learn another language; it's English, with a twist.  There is also a great story on &quot;passing,&quot; and some exploration of voodoo.  This is a text that should be taught alongside Faulkner &amp; Flannery O'Connor-- another look at the South.	2002-03-15

This is fiction, but it has many of the classic elements of the African American slave-writing tradition.  What I think is most crucial about the book is the way the protagonist learns how the slave-system worked-- how it wore down a person's will to choose, to live, and to be human, and how the system affected both slave and owner.<br />Octavia Butler is one of my favorite writers, and even though I haven't seen it taught yet in college classrooms, I will definitely promote the book in my future classes.... it's a classic, much the way Faulkner and Hemingway are.	2002-03-15

I remember in a literature class being read a letter where O'Connor wrote of some klansmen who spent the night in her hometown giving out baskets for the poor, dressed up in their white gowns riding in convertibles decorated with Christmas lights-- she then added &quot;I don't make this stuff up.&quot;<br />Having grown up in the south and actually seen folks walking down the highway with a big wooden cross on their backs, I am always amazed by the fact that though O'Connor paints a story that is funny, she isn't laughing AT anyone, rather, she is showing more how we all can be ridiculous, especially without self-awareness.  Moments of grace, of dark awareness, of sudden self-knowledge (and sometimes that's not what we think it ought to be).  O'Connor is a genius of Southern Gothic, and of American writing.  These short stories should be devoured, then re-read over and over again.	2002-03-15

The story has classic \\"archetypes\\" that fit the mythology of the goddess stories-- virgin, mother, crone-- death & rebirth, purity vs. taint.  I liked the way Lee makes us think of the \\"wicked stepmother's\\" perspective.

In some ways it seems redundant to add to the other reviews of this book-- but I recently revisited it, having read it over ten years ago, and was reminded of why I loved it the first time.  The structure of Tan's narrative-- going back &amp; forth between time lines and mother/daughter stories-- made it more interesting.  The way women repeat the mistakes of our mothers if we do not know them, the way women are taught (not just in Chinese American but all American) to keep disappointment to yourself-- all of these themes rang true for me, too.	2002-03-15

This story is incredible in its use of dialect, its domestic setting, its layers of women's knowledge vs. men's.  It's essentially a love/quest story, with Janie learning about love in its many forms &amp; disguises....  There are multiple layers of story telling here, too.  There's a communal voice, and then there's Janie's voice.<br />What I love most about this story is that Hurston received so much criticism for writing a romance instead of a social commentary protest novel- but in a way, that is what the story is.... it's just that it's about women's lives as opposed to men's lives.  There is protest &amp; commentary in the way Janie is humbled, in the way she is treated as &quot;the mule of the world&quot; and the way when she finally finds love only to be lost again!<br />But still, Janie doesn't accept the disdain of the town, and in telling Phoeby her story and refusing to be ashamed, Janie is a true feminist, and this is a fabulous read.<br />Don't be thrown by the difficult dialect-- just go with it, and it will get easier after a few pages... you'll even probably learn to love the sound of it after a while.  It's musical and &quot;oral&quot; and could help if you read it outloud to yourself some.	2002-03-15

Well, that's certainly true.  It can be dense, and it can also be a hard read-- Hawthorne's characters are not really &quot;likeable&quot; and we have to pay close attention to the language of the novel to really appreciate the richness that has earned this book a firm position in the &quot;literary canon.&quot;  When I have taught this book to non-English majors, one of the most important pieces of advice I have given is, at first, skip the Custom House sketch in the first chapter-- then go back to it.  It's unclear until you've read the whole thing why the Custom House sketch is there-- and since the chapter is there first, you don't get right into the &quot;meat&quot; of the story.  This is what makes an awful lot of people put the book down.  Skip that, and then you'll find an engaging story.  (Do go back to the first chapter, though!)<br />But the classic novel of betrayal, of sin and redemption and of society's focus not on 'people' but on 'behaviors' it considers wrong is definitely worth more than one reading.<br />Also, the history behind the novel is important-- check out some of the history of Anne Hutchinson-- a real life &quot;Hester Prynne&quot; type... you'll learn that Hawthorne's imagination wasn't as fanciful as we'd like to think.	2002-03-15

There are plenty of places for parents to ask questions and share experiences about toddlers, and pregnancy, but it's like the communities disappear as soon as the real trouble starts.<br />This book, as well as Dellasega's website, which you can find in the book's notes (which I found out about through an online discussion of her book) try to create a community (both online and off) of moms' and daughters' voices for those who need it, and those who might someday need it.

I don't usually read non-fiction for fun, usually only if it's something &quot;work related&quot;... but I heard about this book on the radio and had to try it.  The different sections, from a discussion of the tulip to genetically enhanced potatoes, had me thinking about the food I eat and the flowers I love in new ways-- especially about French Fries &amp; organic farming!  Pollan (whose name is metaphorically apt for a botanist!) explains botany with just enough science for those of us who are &quot;right-brainers&quot; to understand the concepts, not so much you need a degree in physics, but I think that it's dense enough for science folks to like it too.  The prose is engaging and the subject matter thought-provoking and stunning.<br />I bought this for my mother-in-law, a science nut, and kept it for myself, a literature nut.

This book is similar in that way-- and it adds the element of a society where gender relationships are examined, like the best utopia sci-fi.  I thought that the characters were interesting, and the clash between a sort of &quot;patriarchy&quot; with a definite matriarchy was thought-provoking, as well.  If you liked books like Ursula K.

Have you ever wondered about a world where just looking up a concept on the Internet could get you arrested?  Or that sharing information with others would make you a criminal?<br />The most interesting concept in Ore's book is the way she shows how society enforces its own unjust laws, perpetuating the system so that the system doesn't have to put forth any effort-- we do it to ourselves (through the Judas girls, especially).<br />At the end, we get just enough hope to feel okay, but not so much it feels like a fairy-tale come true.  This is a world that &quot;could be&quot; our own, with a few tweaks here and there &quot;For our own protection.&quot;  The writing is good, the characters round and well-drawn.<br />I can't decide whether this is a feminist utopia or dystopia-- and maybe, since nowhere is it so black-and-white that it's easy, that is the best way for it to be.	2001-10-18

This is a marvelously intricate novel which does eventually pull all the disparate strands together in a way that if you persevere, you will find rewarding.<br />You'll never look at Santa Claus the same way again.  And those little statues people put up nowadays with a Nativity scene and Santa sitting in?  They'll make you outright chortle.	2001-02-02

I devoured this series when I was a young adult-- but it would be appropriate for a number of reading levels because it deals with such classic themes of good vs. evil and the heroic quest.  This series was one of the things that inspired me to go on to become an English major and thus, a teacher-- I loved these books so much that I couldn't wait to read more and more like them.<br />Today, a lot of kids are discovering the pleasure of reading &quot;magical fiction&quot; through the Harry Potter series-- if you are or know someone who has enjoyed the Potter books, you MUST try these too! You won't regret it!	2000-12-15

If you liked The Hobbit, Star Wars, the Narnia Books, Harry Potter, The Odyssey, The Robert Jordan &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; Series, King Arthur's tales, or *any* other &quot;hero myth&quot; at all, you should also like this book.	2000-11-29

Well, Saxton's biography traces the parts of Jo that are Alcott, and points out the important differences between the fiction Alcott created and the life she lived.  The biography points out Alcott's troubled relationship with her family, her need to support them and feel important, and her severe disabilities later in life (the time she was writing most of her work) because of a &quot;Mercury Cure.&quot;  Saxton takes quite an antagonistic view towards Bronson Alcott, and her sympathies are quite &quot;feminist&quot; in origin-- but all in all, this book will be a great read, and teach you a lot about this incredible, under-rated writer who is a part of our cultural heritage.	2000-10-03

Miller is one of my favorite contemporary feminist theorists.  This study of several &quot;Memoirs&quot; written by adult children of  deceased parents kept me interested in ways that scholarship often does not  (I usually read it for work, not pleasure-- this book combined the two).  With this book, you should also read Maus : A Survivor's Tale by Art  Spiegelman, because one of the most fascinating chapters is a study of  Spiegelman's gripping Holocaust narratives.  Autobiography shapes all  writing in ways that critics are really just beginning to explore-- Dr.  Miller is at the forefront of this field and deservedly so.	2000-09-15

David Sedaris' book was one of the best I've ever  listened to.  The book is recorded by Sedaris, and his voice is perfect for  the readings.  (As it should be, but authors are not always the best  readers).  As other reviewers have noted, this book is hilarious, as well  as occasionally touching and sad.  (Really).  If you have a reason to  listen to audio tapes, get this one. And if you don't, make a reason.	2000-09-06

This is one of the books that started the new-historical feminist  reinterpretation of books that suffer as &quot;bestsellers&quot; and  &quot;pulp&quot; (often women's literature) as history (and a group of  &quot;insiders&quot;) decide what books go on to become  &quot;classics&quot; and which do not.  Tompkins reveals the historical and  socio-political factors that affected Nathaniel Hawthorne's  &quot;classic&quot; status and shows us why other authors, including  Harriet Beecher Stowe and Susan Warner, slipped into relative obscurity  and/or disfavor following their popularity during their lifetimes.  She  does not dispute the richness of Hawthorne's writing, rather points out  that the &quot;canon&quot; changes over time, and the books that fall in or  out are subject to individual and political pressures.  For anyone who ever  wondered &quot;why aren't there more books by &quot;women/minorities/---  fill in blank&quot; in the canon, this book is AN explanation.  Maybe not  the only one-- but a good explanation in very accessible language.	2000-09-06

I teach Ginsberg, often to undergraduates in college, and students often like a visual element in lecture.  This is the text, to  expand your understanding of both Ginsberg's world and our own.	2000-02-22
