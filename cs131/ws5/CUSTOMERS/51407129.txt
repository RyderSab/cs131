On the contrary, Sarah is excited at the thought of making new friends. <br />But not everyone in the  household is as happy for Sarah. In fact, Ralph, Sarah's rotten red cat, is  doing everything he can to sabotage her school day: he sets back her clock,  draws all over her new school dress and tries to trick her into staying  home by faking an illness.<br />When Ralph gets the bright idea to follow  Sarah to school, his antics get her in trouble and keep her from making new  friends. Fans of Rotten Ralph--this is the ninth book in the series--know  that all's well that ends well, but first-time readers may be a bit put off  by Ralph, who seems just a tad too mean. <br />Rubel's chunky illustrations  are colorful and bold. Her rendering of Ralph captures his true spirit  right on the money...he's bright red with pointy ears and a devilish grin.  <br />Gantos' book would be a good way to explore the jealousy that younger  siblings might feel when an older brother or sister gets to try a new and  exciting experience that they don't. Younger children might not recognize  themselves in Rotten Ralph and his outrageous tactics, but I'm betting that  parents will.	2000-07-12

McPhail portrays the life of an artist through the story of a bear with an artistic bent. <br />From the time he was just a cub in the  woods, little bear dreamt of being an artist. He found he could not stop  drawing, whether it be making claw mark portraits in the dirt or using a  burnt stick to render landscapes on paper foraged at the local dump. As his  talent grows, so do his opportunities, and soon the bear is plying his  craft for kings, queens and presidents.<br />Just as art can be found  anywhere, so can artists. That's the moral McPhail hopes to impart with  this book: you can be an artist if that's what you want to be. All you have  to do is say it, &quot;I am an artist.&quot; Children will get the message  that, like the bear, they too can nurture their talents.<br />McPhail's  drawing techniques are illustrated on the flyleaf of the book. His softly  colored pencil drawings between the covers are warm and sweet. A good book  to encourage budding artists.	2000-07-12

The first day in a new school has Sarah Jane Hartwell ducking for the covers. Mr. Hartwell tries to ease her nerves with calm reassurance and wise advice.  <br />But Sarah Jane is convinced that staying  home in bed is the answer to her general fears about a new school: she  doesn't know anyone, no one will like her, it's just too hard and besides,  she hates school. <br />Kids will identify with Sarah Jane's free-floating  school anxiety, even if this isn't their first year in a new school. Love's  richly-colored ink and watercolor illustrations help build anticipation for  the surprise ending to Danneberg's story, a twist that will delight kids  and give them a new perspective on the first day of school. <br />Perfect  late August reading for everyone heading back to school.	2000-07-12

The stories illustrate what happens when pride, greed, envy and other foibles override the common sense that  Mother Earth bestowed upon humans and animals alike. The message the author  hopes you take away after reading the seven origin tales within: &quot;Here  is the world...We must live in it together, not apart.&quot;<br />The tales are  told as if transcribed from the oral tradition and probably work better if  they are presented that way, rather than as a picture book. Older children  who are independent readers will be able to handle the text but younger  kids will enjoy hearing the stories more in a storytime setting.<br />The  illustrations, linoleum block prints painted with watercolor, are well  done, but they probably aren't plentiful enough to keep the attention of  younger children in a one-on-one reading. Each page outlined in traditional  motifs of the tribe whose tale is being told, but there is only one full  page and one smaller illustration per tale. I know that my kids, at least,  are still at the age they tend to lose track of the narrative if they don't  have pictures to focus on. That's why these stories ultimately work better  as oral tales.	2000-05-17

When it refuses to share aphids with another ladybug, the grouchy insect flies off to pick a fight an hour with  a succession of ever-larger animals.    Kids will love the way the  tension seems to build in the story. Will the ladybug get its comeuppance?  Or will it learn to mind its manners? (If you don't remember, you'll just  have to read it yourself to find out!)<br />Carle employs his almost  trademarked tissue paper and tempera collages to great effect here as he  renders more than a dozen different animals. He includes a clock face at  the top of each page, to help kids track the passing of time. A good book  to read when you or your little one is in a grouchy mood.<br />This is one of  those classic picture books that doesn't lose anything in the translation  to board book. If anything, it is improved since the die-cut pages hold up  a lot better when they are made of thick board.	2000-05-17

Arthur's New Puppy is the eighteenth book in the best-selling series. It follows the misadventures of the lovable aardvark as he attempts to housebreak his bouncy puppy Pal.<br />Children seem to identify with Arthur as he struggles with everyday problems with the help of his loving parents (and no help from his pesky little sister, D.W.) and friends.<br />If you have an Arthur fan in the house, or if you have a new puppy in the house, you'll want to check out this book.	2000-05-17

Spike is convinced that his life as a dog is most boring, so he runs away from his owner Shannon, and tries to become a horse, a bird, a chicken  and a fish.<br />Kids probably go through similar feelings from time to time,  and watching Spike's antics brings home the point in a gentle way that  trying to be something or someone you are not usually doesn't work out so  well.<br />Little kids will especially enjoy the silly predicaments that poor  old Spike gets himself into (such as breaking all the eggs, yeeech, when he  tries to sit on a nest like a chicken.)<br />The simple and colorful  illustrations help kids focus in on what Spike is doing in each picture,  the better to notice his expressive face.	2000-05-17

Country mouse Tilly invites her city friend to visit, and then town mouse Milly reciprocates.  Though they both enjoy each other's company, they part with a new respect  for their own place in life.<br />Kneen's warm, inviting watercolors of the  English countryside perfectly set off the lovingly detailed text. Summers  seems to have the knack for exposition without going overboard. From the  description of Tilly doing her sweeping, cleaning and other  &quot;mousework&quot; to the detailed tour of the rooms in Milly's  well-furnished townhouse, this book keeps children engrossed from beginning  to end.	2000-05-17

Each two-page spread features another color as the background, and uses examples  from the cat's life to illustrate it.<br />Cabrera's style uses bold brush  strokes and thickly applied acrylic paint. Her animals are painted as if  done by a child, and there are clever little compositional features that  are delightful to discover. On one page, a cow in the background mimics the  pose of the cat. In another, fluffy white clouds take the shape of familiar  objects to a cat--a fish and a mouse. <br />One unfortunate byproduct of the  graphic style however, is that the colors aren't really mixed too well. The  purple comes off a little lilac and the red and orange are  indistinguishable from each other. But if you use this book as a fun story  to share, and not primarily as a color teaching tool, you should be safe.	2000-05-17

Her father's response let's us know that he has  been down this road before, as he lists a panoply of pet predicaments that  the winsome little lass has already subjected on her family.<br />The story  unfolds in a well-cadenced rhyme that accompanies the off-the-wall  illustrations. Yaccarino has a cool, geometric graphic style that evokes  the early 1960s. This book is a whole lot of fun.	2000-05-17

Instead of suggesting you force feed your little ones on an exclusive diet  of carrots and celery, this book gives step-by-step instructions on how to  cut the fat from popular name-brand and homemade foods (special sauce is  all fat, wipe it off any fast food burger.)

I would recommend this book not only to  children who have been adopted, but to any child who wants to have a better  understanding of the different ways people become a family.<br />Curtis, the  mother of two, has a good ear for the way a young child will ask a parent  to tell a story, filling in all the details themselves as they're still  asking the question.

Her newspaper columns were  clipped and mailed back and forth between my mom and her friends.<br />Suzann,  however, is the voice of my generation, coming to me at a time  (post-childbirth, pre-menopause) that I can appreciate the humor in such  essays as &quot;Good Mothers Do&quot; and &quot;Birthday Boondoggles.&quot;  I can envision myself sending these gems to my contemporaries, but more  likely through e-mail, than &quot;snail mail.&quot;<br />But she wisely  doesn't limit herself to writing about motherhood. She manages to skewer  the rest of the world, and the goofy people in it, as well. Suzann, who  lives just outside of Springfield, Missouri, is a contributing editor to  Family Circle magazine and writes a Sunday column for the Springfield  News-Leader.	2000-05-03

In fact, he's having a hard time believing in himself-ever since his father died and his mother named him &quot;man of the house.&quot;<br />But all that begins to change when his mother brings Martin and his daughter, Wendy, into their lives. Thomas begins to withdraw into the solitary world of his computer,  to the comfort of anonymous chat rooms, where he discovers that hiding  behind a screen name (his is TScott) has its perils as well as its  advantages.<br />This is the beginning of a very good story about learning to  trust and love again. Unfortunately, that story gets bogged down in  too-short chapters and a slightly stilted writing style.<br />The story  probably could have done without the murky science fiction which improbably  pops up in the second half of the book. The details, which the author  intended to add local color (the book's KYTV Channel 3 anchorman's name is  'Bony Teason', the real anchor's name is Tony Beason), instead tend to  create an inside joke situation that limits the book to a local  audience.<br />I hope Jane Hale continues to write, she's a very good  storyteller. I think perhaps with the right editor and publisher, she could  reach a nationwide audience of young children-especially boys-with the  cyber adventures of TScott.<br />Hale lives in Buffalo, and writes a weekly  column, &quot;Buffalo...As I Remember It&quot;, for the County Courier.	2000-05-03

Her style is boldly primitive images against a textured  background. <br />Cat lovers ought to appreciate the story of how cats use  their magic to choose their family. Art lovers will love Fedden's  paintings. Non-cat or art lovers might want to pass this one by.	2000-04-28

After all, a little name recognition never hurts when it comes  to selling books. But once you have the book in hand, it likely to be  Johnson's moody oil paintings that beckon you to linger over the slim  picture book.<br />The illustrations were done in oil paint on paper, some of  it brushed, some block printed. Key elements, such as the cat, are then  outlined with string that has been drenched in paint. It's a very unique  artistic style, and that in itself ought to interest children, who will be  tempted to try the effect for themselves.	2000-04-28

You know, wished for curly hair when yours is straight, or visa versa--the old &quot;the grass is always greener&quot; problem. That's the situation that a little orange  striped cat finds herself in &quot;The Cat Barked.&quot;<br />&quot;Dogs have  all the fun!&quot; proclaims the envious puss, as she details the reasons  why: dogs go to the park, dogs catch crooks and they're always the heroes  in movies and books.<br />&quot;Silly old cat,&quot; exclaims the mop-headed  little girl who owns her, as she points out that there is a downside to  dogs and an upside to cats.<br />The rhyming text does a good job of capturing  the futility and folly of coveting your neighbor's bark. But what really  stand out are the cool collages by Monks, a fine arts major at England's  Kingston University. She uses a combination of paint, pencil, fabric and  photos from magazines to concoct her personable canines and felines.  Another unique artistic style that budding artists will be itching to  emulate.	2000-04-28

The woodcuts were made on a nineteenth-century hand press and painted by  hand with an earthy palette. You won't have to be a cat lover to enjoy this  beautiful book.	2000-04-28

Papa Gatto, a recently widowed high-ranking feline official in the prince's court, has need of a helper to care for his kittens. He places an ad with the town crier, &quot;you choose your payment, no amount too great.&quot;<br />This lucrative offer draws the attention of a widow with a daughter--lazy, cold-hearted but beautiful Sophia--and a stepdaughter--kind and hardworking Beatrice.  The stepmother, sensing easy money, pushes Sophia to accept the position, though she is ill-suited for the work... The whole story is set in a sun-drenched Tuscan village.

Unwanted by snooty Mrs. Edge, because she isn't purebred, Bo and her siblings narrowly escape being drowned by Withers, the sour-faced butler.<br />Bo is rescued by the kind-hearted Billy Bates, a sailor aboard the Red Betsy, a fishing trawler.  He stows her away aboard ship and their friendship weathers many a storm, both figurative and literal.<br />Andrews, perhaps because she is a singer and actress, has an excellent ear for words. Her story has a cadence that just begs to be read aloud (preferably by someone with a voice like Mary Poppins!)<br />Some of Cole's illustrations are a little bit reminiscent of Disney animation stills, though this might be because the first of the book reminds one of the Aristocats. The number of the pictures, about one every page, makes this a great chapter book to read to kids who are used to shorter picture books, the drawings help focus little ones' attention on the story.	2000-04-28

His family takes good care of Simon, feeding him baby food, providing places for him  to warm his achy old bones and letting him sleep in bed with them, despite  his stinky cat breath.<br />But despite this loving treatment, Simon is tired  of living. After spending a night shuffling through old memories of his  kittenhood, he sticks his legs in the air and breaths his last.<br />Or so he  thinks. At that moment, his family plops a kitten on his stomach and the  old trouper discovers a new purpose in life--to become the kitten's  &quot;Grannyman.&quot;<br />Schachner's story is poignant and her  illustrations, done in textured charcoal with watercolors, are expressive  and show the artist's deep love for cats. Her Simon is at once both  pitiable and noble. The Grannyman is highly recommended for cat lovers and  sentimentalists alike.	2000-04-28

The story, though illustrated with beautiful watercolors, begins rather abruptly. It's a little hard at first to  recognize that Alice is the name of the cat and not the little girl, who is  named Annie.<br />The story gives us a cat's-eye view of Paris, the city of  lights. The pictures contain a lot of the usual sites of the city on the  Seine, including the ubiquitous Frenchman with long baguettes of bread in  the basket of his bike. Since the book is targeted to the non-French,  throwing in an illustration of the Eiffel Tower, easily recognizable even  to young children, might have been nice.<br />A nice book to read when you  want to make believe you are in Paris in April.	2000-04-28

Everyone, from family members to classmates, offers suggestions: Kabuki, Nimbus and Fish Breath among them. But no one can agree on which name is just right  for the black and white feline. As the family goes through name after name,  the cat assimilates into the family's daily life. His curiosity gets him  into some hot water, but his luck gets him out unscathed.<br />By the end of  the story, when he falls out a window and luckily manages to land safely on  his feet, a name chooses the cat. (And I bet you can guess what it is!)    Pringle, a prolific writer of science and nature books for children, wrote  this warm story after his family adopted a stray cat (whom they named  Willow.) Potter's colorful pastel drawings are equally warm-hearted. Her  playful illustrations of the cat &quot;trying on&quot; each of the names  will please young readers.	2000-04-12

It's not a handbook or manual on survival, rather it's a compilation of 22 scary folktales to tell around the fire or during a late-night gabfest in the cabin. <br />Between these pages you'll encounter  ghosts, witches, demons, evil eyes, giants, monsters, talking heads and  other beasties from near and far, Japan to Iceland, Eastern Europe to  Mexico. The sources for the tales are listed at the back of the book. Many  of them come from respected regional and national archives.<br />Even so, the  stories vary in their effectiveness and \\"scare factor.\\" Some don't rise  much above the level of urban legends passed around on the Internet.  Others, like the title story, are true folk tales, with obvious staying  power.<br />The stories are short, just five-six pages each. Several of them  are illustrated with pencil drawings, which are moody, if not exactly  scary. <br />Older elementary and middle school students will get a kick out  of scaring themselves silly with these horror stories.	2000-04-06

He had rescued them from Mrs. Sump, the evil (naturally) head of the  orphanage, in Stanley's previous book, \\"Saving Sweetness.\\"<br />In this funny  sequel, the Sheriff takes to housekeeping like a fish takes to a pile of  sawdust; that is, he is sorely lacking in the home arts. He serves tuna  fish soup and pickle and banana pie and washes the windows with butter. The  orphans, with Sweetness at the fore, decide to domesticate him. First, they  need to learn to read so they can decipher a letter from the Sheriff's  long-lost love, Lucy Locket, and then find a way to get them hitched.<br />The  twangy Texas lingo is snappy without being laid on too thick, helping  rather than hindering when the book is read aloud. The mixed media  illustrations, combining scribbly colored pencil drawings with collages of  wallpaper, cut paper and masking tape, perfectly match the warm absurdity  of the text. A heart warming and hilarious story.	2000-04-06

Baseball has always been an escape for her and her eleven-year-old friends. All of a sudden, Jenny begins acting strangely, picking fights and arguing over close calls. Then there  was the problem with the big kids, led by Jenny's stepbrother Billy, who  chased them off the ball field by throwing rocks at them.<br />Jenny's friends  are determined to find out what is wrong so they can keep their after  school games going. It just so happens that they learn about compassion and  prejudice at the same time.<br />Close Call is a sports book for kids of both  sexes. The teams are pretty evenly co-ed and there is a balanced mixture of  baseball action and interpersonal relationships.<br />Much of the exposition  unfolds in dialog and some of the chapters seem a bit too short and break  off in the middle of a scene. It's a little choppy, but this might work to  the advantage of reluctant readers who need to take a break.	2000-04-06

As she wonders aloud what it might be--a monkey? A bundle of carrots? Or Humpty-Dumpty?--the bundle proclaims \\"No, no, no, no, NO!\\" until finally it reveals itself: \\"It's ME!\\" cries the tousle-headed little toddler.<br />If  you're a baby boomer, you might remember this book from your childhood. It  was originally published in 1951 under the title \\"The Bundle Book.\\" Here it  is updated with a new title and brand new illustrations.<br />Purists, who  flinch every time they see remakes of Disney classics like \\"The  Absent-Minded Professor\\" and \\"The Parent Trap,\\" will no doubt cringe when  they hear that old books are being redone with new pictures. But, as nice  as the original pale chalk and charcoal drawings were, they were not  irreplaceable illustrations along the lines of Garth Williams' pencil  sketches that accompany the \\"Little House\\" books. The story doesn't suffer  at all, and the updated look just means a new generation of children will  be exposed to a tender little story.<br />Noonan has illustrated the new book  beautifully. The cover alone, a touching portrait of mother and child,  makes this book stand out from others on the shelf. The rich pastel colors  are as warm and inviting as the chenille bedspread under which the child  hides.<br />I think this would make a nice gift for a new mother on Mother's  Day and will be a book that toddlers want read over and over again.	2000-04-06

Violet's family is forced to move to California, as so many other  Dust Bowl families had to do. They went expecting to find a land of milk  and honey, but instead end up as migrant farm workers. Porter, a middle  school English teacher, has done a good job researching this, her first  novel. From the first page, her writing aptly evokes the grim and gritty  reality of living in a land that's ankle deep in dust.<br />The book  alternates chapters between the two girls, with each telling her part of  the story in first-person narrative and later on in epistle form. Porter  does a good job of giving each girl her own distinct voice, and of dropping  names every so often so you can keep track of who is narrating each  chapter.<br />A good story on friendship in general and on the Dust Bowl in  particular. The book would be a good early introduction to Steinbeck's \\"The  Grapes of Wrath.\\"	2000-04-06

The grossness is handled very lightly, so the book should appeal  equally to girls and boys (which is good since the Canal Street Kids have  both boy and girl members and the series itself is unisex.)
