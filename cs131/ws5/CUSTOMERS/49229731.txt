Mann, P'town native, novelist and biographer has a new book out, the small, slight and compact, Gay Pride: A Celebration of All Things Gay and Lesbian (Citadel Press, $15.95).  From the Ancient Greeks to Will and Grace, Mann writes short breezy pieces about 101 reasons to celebrate the rich heritage and vast cultural contributions of the gay and lesbian community. Some pieces are breezy and funny, others more considered and moving. There are no real surprises here, just interesting takes on the various aspects of gay and lesbian people, places and things.

The almost mystical need for authors to set down their impressions, feelings and notions about this small spit of land defies logic. From Eugene O'Neill to Tennessee Williams, from Norman Mailer to Michael Cunningham J. Mann, the spirit of Provincetown remains a ghost to be chased. Is the tip of Cape Cod a stern mistress, a hard master, a riddle wrapped in an enigma? Is it more of a place in the mind than a geographical position? It is, without question, a community of infinite interest to everyone. Authors, painters, sculptures, theatre-folk, tourists, bohemians, ne'er-do-wells and do-gooders have flocked here, apparently, for close to a thousand years.  Thorwald Eriksson, Lief's brother, possibly dropped by around 1004 CE.  And last Thursday, it was probably my Uncle, in a strapless indigo Givenchy, who stopped by for a spin on the dance floor.<br /><br />  Life certainly isn't a drag here.<br /><br />  Now comes a new history of the place, Provincetown: From Pilgrim Landing to Gay Resort, by Karen Christel Krahulik (New York University Press, $29.95).  It's an infinitely readable history, mostly sociological and mostly interesting. Krakulik, a sometimes Provincetown citizen and historian, has a great many details at her fingertips, and zips along at good speed. And it is undeniably fascinating to realize that apparently all who came to live in Provincetown were eventually supplanted by the laborers and the consumers they were determined to attract.  Thus were the Yankees supplanted by the Portuguese sailors and their families, to be supplanted by the artists and the lesbian/gay/transgendered, to be supplanted recently by the entitled super rich. To be sure, it is a story of gentrification that can be seen in a number of place, cities and towns, including New York's Upper West Side and Boston's South End went through similar periods of Yankee money supplanted by ethnic minorities supplanted by gays and lesbians supplanted by the super rich.  Closer to Provincetown in feel, Key West, that southernmost spit of our country, almost mirrors the experience.<br /><br />  But, in many ways, Krahulik's book illustrates a microcosm of this displacement phenomenon, and it is fascinating. Implicitly an economic history, what has happened --- and is happening --- in Provincetown in many ways is what has happened --- and is happening --- in our country.  It's no longer the do-gooders versus the ne'er-do-wells, but, frankly, the \\"haves\\" versus the \\"have nots.\\"  As rich and rewarding as the experience of Provincetown may be, very soon, as Krahulik points out, it may be well beyond the means of most people. Gay, straight, Portuguese, Yankee may all be squeezed out by the economic realities.minorities supplanted by gays and lesbians supplanted by the super rich.

These are copies of the Polaroids Andy took, neatly bound in red covers and bound with plastic spiral bindings --- 11 mini books in all with the twelfth (black) volume containing the pertinent names and dates of the photographs, plus an introduction by the internationally-renowned photographer Francois-Marie Banier. It is Banier who captures the allure of these instant photos best: \\"In his Polaroids, in those seemingly lacquered little pictures, I saw at once the cry of frantic and reckless youth, lost in a pseudo-civilized world. Each of these Polaroids goes one step further, telling us, from the land of Mickey Mouse: you are all Andy Warhol characters.\\" From 1969 to 1975, celebrities (from Christopher Isherwood to Mick Jagger, Caroline Kennedy to Rudolph Nureyev, Rex Reed to Sylvia Miles), drag queens and assorted Warholian characters are captured crisply, realistically, and above all, affectionately. Owning the Red Books is (almost) like owning one of the more bizarre time capsules of the twentieth century.	2004-11-02

Shoes, fans, gloves and other glamorous necessities from the tastemakers of Vogue, Mademoiselle and Harper's Bazaar are full of wit, fun, style and a crazy cartoon-like kookiness that proves irresistible. The preface is written by Simon Doonan, the Creative Director of Barney's New York, who helps place the work squarely in historical perspective. While the drawings are clearly imbued with the unmistakable Warhol sense of fun,  they also illustrate a very interesting relationship between what was commercial art and what was to become fine art. These drawings may have been originally done to illustrate articles and advertisements, but that strange, off-center sense of reality that Warhol later brought to his paintings and photographs is clearly present. And clearly still fashionable.	2004-11-02

Think of this as an Andy a day keeping the aggravation away. Compiled by the staff of the Andy Warhol Museum (located in Pittsburgh, PA, and this year celebrating its tenth anniversary), this is a monumental, if scattered, collection of everything Warhol, deliberately non-traditional and open-ended. Fashion sketches from the `50s, Polaroids, the Brillo boxes, stills from his movies and television appearances, silkscreens and pencil drawings, the Death and Disaster Series, the Three Marilyns, the collaborations with the Velvet Underground ... it's all here, and it's all interlaced with quotes from Warhol, and \\"experts\\" on Warhol. The experts, today, sound like bozos, but there is humor and humanity in all of Warhol's comments. 365 Takes is a big book, perhaps too big, since Warhol is best savored in smaller doses. Still, the book certainly whets one's appetite for more concentrated, linear works of this great artist. Warhol's take on the middle of the twentieth century is astoundingly accurate and informed. Certainly very much the artist as an outsider observing the current culture, his views are surprisingly kind and simple. Let's face it: We all love gossip, dirty pictures and celebrities. Maybe we couldn't admit it back then, but it was true. And, of course, we all love Campbell's Soup.	2004-11-02

We always knew Cecil Beaton was a genius --- actor, costume designer, diarist, lover of Greta Garbo, social historian and all-around 20th century Gadabout. There wasn't a place worth going to that he hadn't been, and there wasn't a person worth knowing that he hadn't met. And, as evidenced by the comprehensive Beaton Portraits, damn few celebrities he hadn't photographed.<br />  But here was Bobby and Ethel in a way that we had never seen them before, stripped of the Hyannisport-baked tans, free of the clinging kiddies. Beaton captures just Bobby and his wife; she's standing behind him, so positioned that her head seems to be floating on his left shoulder. Bobby is smiling awkwardly, Ethel is a toothy beam. It is, in one word, stunning.<br />  Proof, indeed, that among Beaton's many talents, the strongest was his power of observation. He used a camera most of his life, to photograph everything from the day-to-day mundane to world shaking events and personalities. During the war, Beaton's photos of the uncelebrated British populace going to and fro in their workaday world, trying to ignore the horror and pain of the rubble caused by German bombs surrounding them, take your breath away, even today. And his candid, painstaking diaries, recording the earthshaking and ephemera of his life day-to-day, even hour-to-hour, are splendidly entertaining and a feast for history and entertainment buffs.  But, as this current book shows, Beaton's true genius lay in his ability to capture the look, heart and soul of all those celebrities he photographed.<br />  From Queens to Rock Stars, from old masters to young mistresses, from the 20s through the 70s, media [prostitues] and geniuses reside side-by-side in these pages. And, if God is in the detail, these seemingly simplistic photos are rich with telling trivialities.  The clown's collar framing Audrey Hepburn, the vibrant plants surrounding Sylvia Sidney's face, Orson Welles' hand draped carelessly over a skull, the pearl earrings and necklace accenting Leontyne Price ... each photo hauntingly evokes the time and personality of each celebrity. The British Royal Family, as well as the outcast Wallis Simpson, are lovingly recreated here, as well as Churchill, Noel and Gertie, Warhol and Jagger, and everyone in-between.<br />  Beaton was a true historian --- his evocation of the 20th century is an astounding trip through six decades of the famous, talented, twisted and distinguished.  But Beaton Portraits is much more than a slick coffee table book. Each of the more than 150 plates summon our previous century as quickly and immediately as a flash of half-forgotten memory.  Beaton happily records more than 50 years of glamour, style and the effortless world where charm and taste were the only requirements.n Welles' hand draped carelessly over a skull, the pearl earrings and necklace accenting Leontyne Price ... each photo hauntingly evokes the time and personality of each celebrity.

This volume boasts 60 gorgeous never-before-published paintings, along with commentary by Rodrigue on the birth of Blue Dog and its transformation into a pop culture icon.

(Their theory, in a much<br />reduced nutshell: Our physiology has been programmed since Day One to eat and breed in sync with seasonal variations in light exposure; in other words, \\"with the invention of the light bulb 70 years ago, we fundamentally altered this delicate biological rhythm.\\") Why have we been kept in the dark about such supposed healthy connections? The answers are here, along with various tips and tricks, secrets and suggestions. These guys have done their homework --- their notes and resources make up a third of the book's 350 pages --- but before stocking up on room-darkening shades and tossing all those three-ways, spend time carefully reading their claims.

Peanuts are big. Real big. And here's the book to prove it. Andrew Smith's \\"Peanuts: The Illustrious History of the Goober Pea\\" is an unexpected delight. It's part history, part cookbook, and totally digestible. One nibble and you cannot put it down. (Sort of like those teeny treats themselves.) In this, the first-ever culinary history of the protein-riddled legume, Smith offers much food for thought ... in antebellum America, the peanuts was considered unfit for consumption except by slaves and the poor. But as Americans grew more sophisticated, as Americans realized the power and punch that's packed within those figure-eight shells, the peanut became a star at circuses, fairs and theaters. Street vendors hawked them; people gobbled them up. Warm. Cold. In a buttery paste. On bread. By the handfuls. Then there are the people beyond the nut: nutty expert George Washington Carver, John Harvey Kellogg (an early advocate of vegetarianism who extolled the virtues of peanut butter) and a couple of Italian immigrants peanut vendors who created an empire with the name of Planters.

Written by Charlotte Chandler (whose previous works include &quot;I, Fellini&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends&quot;), the tome is based on interviews she conducted with Wilder and his friends over a period of years. The result is a wonderful kaleidoscope of movies, politicians, actors, geniuses and louses. From Sigmund Freud to Louis B. Mayer, from Richard Strauss to Joan Fontaine, from Prince Yussupov to Walter Matthau --- Wilder knew them all. He is the man who put Marilyn Monroe over a subway grate, Jack Lemmon in a dress and Gloria Swanson in the most famous close-up of them all. The great beacon shining through the entire book is, of course, the wit and humor of the man.  Wilder is certainly one of the great comic directors of all time, and his legacy is astounding. By structuring the book around the subject's work in a strictly chronological manner, Chandler creates a picture of Wilder that is at once true and wildly engrossing. The early stories about journalism in pre-war Berlin are as fascinating as the later tales of success in glittering Hollywood. That the last 20 years of his life, arguably the most creative time in an artist's life, were spent without a single film project is the underlying tragedy of this book, and Chandler doesn't exactly dwell on it, but the painful reality is certainly there. We like to think of him as this way: Billy Wilder, Somebody's Perfect. (Submitted by staff member Stephen J. Finn)	2003-02-08

Here, in this chunky compendium with its glorious cover, Slide pays homage to little-known actors and actresses with personal remembrances straight from the giants of yesteryear; quotes have been culled from conversations and previously published sources. Some of the names will be familiar, if only because of legend or a brief transition to talkies . Swanson, Garbo, Keaton, Gish, Fairbanks and Pickford. Then there are those only die-hard film freaks will recognize: Robert Harron, John Bunny, Babe London, Dorothy Mackaill, Lowell Sherman, Jetta Goudal ...names whose faces were introduced to us at 16 frames per second. Slide renounces the reputation of some while restoring fame to others. The profiles are concise and compelling, reminding us that real lives can often be sadder than any Hollywood scenario. The vintage photos remind us that they had faces then. And so we will be silent no longer: \\"Silent Players\\" slides into our list one of best reference books around.	2003-02-08

COOK. EAT UP AGAIN.	So much more than a cook's tool, this treasury is a welcome delight --- a well conceived, beautifully illustrated resoruce that's part cookbook, part history book. We thought we knew all there was to know about herbs: rosemary, dill, sage and sometimes tarragon. What we learned will serve us well, especially in those things we serve up in the kitchen. Released by the folks at the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in California, the book includes information on growing herbs, mail sources on where to buy fresh and dried herbs, and, of course, recipes --- brpken down by type, such as appetizers, main courses, jams and jellies, breads, beverages --- that will send you zooming to the nearest [store]. The stunning color illustrations are from Elizabeth Blackwell's 1737 book, \\"A Curious Herbal,\\" a gem that's housed in the Huntington's rare book department. A celebration, indeed!	2003-02-07

And that child ain't Julia. We have finally discovered  a woman who understands the way most Americans eat: fast and faster. Brook Noel has penned a series of ultra-slim cookbook (think of them as gastronomic guides) that offer recipes, and serve up tasty tricks and tips. There's even a  sprinkling of savory trivia --- who knew the pretzel was invented in 600 AD by a monk who crossed the dough to form hands in prayer? The meals in minutes (Noel insists \\"no list of ingredients shall be longer than the instructions\\") are easy to make. She proves that anyone can conquer kitchen chaos, win the battle of rush hour without rushing, and still come out smelling like a cinnamon bun.	2003-02-07

And is she really that big? Those looking for such titillating tidbits should turn elsewhere. This collection of interviews with some of country's biggest names (Wynette, Judd, Jones, McEntire, Acuff, Pearl, Monroe) focuses more on the \\"real\\" side of the perfomer and person ... in other words, there's more talk of music and radio play than wigs and full figures and rhinestone cowboys. Nash, a veteran country music journalist, uses her comfortable, conversational style to get the people to open up. This reissue (the tome was first unleashed in 1988) doesn't offer anything we don't already know, but it's handy to keep on the shelf just in case you really want to know Emmylou's take on overdubs.	2003-02-07

Authors Jim<br />Cogan and William Clark remind us that the recording studios were as responsible for hit records (and, we assume, the flops) as the singers themselves. Here, they take us on a<br />fascinating tour of those hallowed halls, telling the stories behind the classic songs and albums. Each of the 15 chapters profiles a different studio, as well as the musicians,<br />producers and engineers who worked there. Stax, Sun, Motown, Sun, Chess, Atlantic ... they are all here, along with the tales. Brian Wilson earning a reputation likening him to<br />Mozart for the meticulous attention he paid to the groundbreaking arrangements for The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" ... guitarist Steve Cropper using a Zippo lighter as a metal slide<br />on \\"Soul Man\\" ... a bike chain whipped against a board giving \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" a pinch of percussive punch ... Ray Charles, learning that his beloved Mama has died, pours<br />his grief into \\"Sinner's Prayer.\\" Everyone is here --- from Aretha (was she ever really that thin?) to Nat, from Little Richard to big Otis, from Muddy to Marvin. Perhaps even more<br />alluring than the informative text are the photographs --- mostly never-before-seen peeks into the sanctums of sound. Tune in!	2003-02-03

What makes Bronson&#146;s effort stand out from the copycats is his approach to all things tuneful --- the book devotes separate chapters to such categories as artists, writers, producers, subjects, years, even labels. The best of the best is also here, such as &#147;The Top 50 Songs Written By Holland-Dozier-Holland,&#148; &#147;The Top 20 Songs of The Carpenters,&#148; &#147;The Top 100 Pre-Rock Era Remakes,&#148; &#147;The Top 30 Songs Produced By Snuff Garrett.&#148; Especially fun is &#147;The Top 100 Songs By One-Hit Wonders&#148; &#133; remember Zager & Evans?

This book is, in many ways, a sequel to Merv's best-selling autobioraphy of a couple of decades ago. \\"Good Life\\" picks up when that tome left off, with Merv reinventing himself as a businessman and, eventually, as one of the world's richest men. There are great Tallulah tales, and delightful stories about Al Pacino, Vanna White, Orson Welles, Clint Eastwood, Cary Grant, Lucille Ball, Eva Gabor, Nancy and Ron, Donald Trump, Ted Koppel and Errol Flynn ... who Merv met while the actor was nude. \\"Now how shall I put this?\\" Merv muses. \\"I think it's fair to say that Flynn brandished a sword both on and off the screen.\\" It's all warm and witty and cozy chatter from someone who feels like a friend. Until the last chapter. There, Merv starts to spout off about how much money he has ... not in dollar amounts, but in boastful brags. There's too much talk about buying jets, yachts, hotels and casinos, of building this house and that house (with \\"house\\" sometimes meaning \\"ranch\\" or \\"compound\\"), of having marble and tile imported from across the world, of collecting horses and priceless art works by French Impressionists and Colorists, of having an associate deposit a check for $273 million (\\"the interest alone was $50,000 a day\\"), when most senior citizens at the same bank that day were depositing their monthly Social Security check for \\"$400 or $500 at most.\\" This is when Merv needs to be tuned out and turned off. \\"Making the Good Life Last\\" is good ...  until the last drop.	2003-01-23

Here, in the quintessential American resort, was the birthplace of the amusement park ... as well as the roller coaster and hot dog.

Critics dubbed Coney Island \\"Bedlam By the Sea,\\" but it became a necessary outlet for the masses who were willing to loosen their spirits and wallets.

King had access to Geffen and hundreds of people in and outside of Geffen's circle of power.

That's because her entire life---and we mean her entire life---has been laid out, in minute detail, in Gerald Clarke's latest biography. We all already know about the evil stage mother, the gay father, the hospitalizations, the pill popping, the marriages to gay husbands, the abortions, the mean managers.. Here we learn about Judy's lesbian affairs and about the one (unnamed, of course) male lover who made her she sing \\"Over the Rainbow\\" after giving him oral satisfaction. Yikes! Still, even though Judy has been the subject of too many books already, Clarke manages to write with candor and clarity, thanks to interviews with sources who kept mum before, as well as the benefit of an autobiography Garland herself had started, but never finished. Wonder if Liza still thinks life is a cabaret after this one.	2002-12-31

It took Frances Kiernan nine years to research and write this biography of America's first lady of letters. It was well worth the wait. To see McCarthy &quot;plain&quot; -- simple, yet with sharp clarity -- Kiernan pieced together her subject's life, from years spent in Seattle, New York, Maine, Italy and Paris, by interviewing more than 200 people who knew her. What emerges is an intellectual,, affectionate yet judgmentally balanced portrait of a woman, mother, stepmother, wife, ex-wife, lover and friend ... as well as an important literary voice. With Kiernan on the scene, make that two important voices.	2002-12-31

Here's a fun way to bust out of the doldrums and learn about the really important things in life. Author David Lindsay has stuck his nose (and eyes and feet and Lord-knows-what-else) to find the truth behind the origins of those things we take for granted. Like Vaseline. It was first marketed as a medicine, Doris Day slathers the stuff on her nightly (let's face it, her skin is oh-so-soft) and its inventor ate a spoonful of the stuff every day...and lived to his 90s. Like the intermittent windshield wiper. It was invented by a man who was hit in the eye with a champagne cork on his wedding night, causing permanent damage. (All that squinting in rainy weather.) Like the brassiere. The over-the-shoulder boulder holder was invented by the very first Girl Scout of America as an alternative to the restrictive corsets of the late 19th-century. Now, really, would we make this stuff up?ONS	2002-12-31

The story may seem simple -- a brass cross is stolen from an Episcopal church, only to be found on its roof of a synagogue -- but stick around beyond the first 30  pages or so. The theft gives Father Thomas Pemberton reason to question (and renew his faith),  and affords his writer friend, Everett, a reason to write a novel. And so \\"City of God\\"  is a novel-within-a-novel, whose \\"notebooks\\" tell this story chockfull of images  and voices (and even song lyrics), tossed in with Holocaust horrors, defrocking and love  affairs, that bemuse, befuddle and bewilder.

EVEN AFTER ALL THESE YEARS	There she goes, Miss America. And Bess Myerson was America's first (and still  only) Jewish Miss America, an groundbreaking achievement that makes for riveting  cultural and social history. This is not a new book --- it is the first paperback edition  of Susan Dworkin's landmark collaborative biography that was first published in 1987,  and it is still an important one. Dworkin weaves together oral histories, research and  commentary to present not only a vivid portrait of pre-feminist America in the '30s and  '40s, but one of Jews, of women, of the anti-Semitic riddled Miss America pageant and of  Myerson's own life. A crowning success. Still.	2002-09-29
