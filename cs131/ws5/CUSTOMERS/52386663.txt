He extols a quantum leap in computing power, but nowhere in his vision is there any increase in wisdom.  Kurzweil consults for the U.S. military, and includes a section on high-tech war with absolutely no discussion of eliminating or even reducing war in his fantastic silicon future.<br /><br /> I am definitively with Bill McKibben and Bill Joy on this one.  If I thought it was possible to embargo the technology I would be all for it, but given the power of delusions (power! wealth! immortality!) in the world today, that seems a remote possibility at best.  The fear and denial of death seem far too strong.<br /><br /> Kurzweil seems well-intentioned, if maniacal -- he seems to think that as humans merge with computers, poverty will be eliminated (but not war?), art will be better, and in general things will become paradisical.  But why does he think that?  Why will an increase in computing power necessarily make the world better?  Just look at how many smart people are in the grip of evil pursuits to realize that Intelligence is not Enlightenment.  Einstein already pointed out years ago the folly of placing our hopes in technology.  The only technology that excites me is renewable energy, which holds out the slight hope that we might avoid utterly destroying the only planet we have to live on by burning up every last ounce of fossil fuels.<br /><br /> I honestly think Kurzweil's dream of \\"uploading\\" humans into computers is too far-fetched to worry about very much.  Of the future technologies he addresses, the one that really concerns me is genetic engineering, to which he devotes little space.  He sees it only as a stepping stone to silicon immortality, but I see it as the doorway into a nightmare of manipulation, not for the good of all but for the benefit of the powerful few, who will try to establish themselves as a permanent genetic elite.<br /><br /> I think Kurzweil's fantasy is sad, and I hope that people will see through it and realize that what we need is moral and spiritual  evolution, without which technological \\"progress\\" is hollow at best, and most likely unspeakably worse -- how many species will be driven to extinction by human \\"progress\\" as you read this review?  On human morality I recommend the Sermon on the Mount and the teachings of the Buddha.

It's obvious, and there's nothing exciting about it -- it's certainly not as exciting as the title of this book.  Of course there would be more money for policing borders if we weren't fighting in Iraq, which produces more terrorists than it eliminates.<br /><br /> Unfortunately a book like this leads to no productive outcomes, it just panics the herd, which is likely to stampede over the nearest cliff and land in the next idiotic counter-productive war.	2005-09-13

Huntington wrote it after the collapse of the Soviet Union, eight years before 9/11.  It's not an \\"instant book\\" -- the focus is the Big Picture, not a single event, person, or organization.  The central practical point of THE CLASH is precisely the opposite of what many people take it to be.<br /><br /> Huntington's analysis is not at all original, what he does is simply to revive and re-popularize the civilizational approach to world history of Toynbee and Spengler.  Contrary to the knee-jerk response that this implies the need for war, or that it is ethnocentric, THE CLASH actually cuts strongly against both of those ideas.  Europe/The West is but one of several major world civilizations, each with long histories, religions and cultures, and it is arrogant to think that the rest of the world can be remade in our image.<br /><br /> Here's how Huntington summarizes the point of THE CLASH:<br /><br /> \\"In the emerging world of ethnic conflict and civilizational clash, Western belief in the universality of Western culture suffers three problems: it is false, it is immoral, and it is dangerous (p. 310).\\"  \\"Western universalism is dangerous to the world because it could lead to a major intercivilizational war between core states and it is dangerous to the West because it could lead to the defeat of the West (p. 311).\\"<br /><br /> So in other words, the U.S. should AVOID clashes with other civilizations, including Islam and China, precisely the opposite conclusion from the one projected onto Huntington by those who have not actually read the book.  Further, Huntington argues against global crusading in general, for democracy, or nation-building, or any other idealist policies premised on remaking the world in the image of the West.  However, Huntington is not a unilateralist.  He sees the importance and necessity of international institutions, and sees that they can play an increasingly important role in the future as the temporary preponderance of military power inevitably declines.<br /><br /> It's important to add, for those on both the right and the left who persist in misunderstanding Huntington's point, that he OPPOSED the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

This is another solid entry in that category.  It's not exhaustive, but compiles material on how Eastern and Southern European immigrants to the U.S. \\"became white.\\"  The category of \\"white people\\" is treated as a given, and as a constant in the U.S. today, but Roediger and others reveal the shifting meaning of the category, and the fight that various groups have waged to gain entry into the \\"white club\\" with its privileges.  Just one example:  the club was established by the British, of course, and from their point of view the Irish were certainly not white.  The ruling WASPs had the power to keep the Irish out, viewing them as practically subhuman, and it took the Irish many decades to fight their way in.  So \\"white\\" is a marker of group boundary between the more and less powerful, pure and simple, a marker of division, not an inherent biological OR cultural category.<br /><br /> One of the original works in this field was Ted Allen's THE INVENTION OF THE WHITE RACE.  Noel Ignatiev, inspired by Allen, wrote HOW THE IRISH BECAME WHITE, and launched the journal RACE TRAITOR as well, with the slogan \\"treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity.\\"  In the meantime, Roediger had emerged as a major voice in history, legitimating the line of research that led to Allen gaining a wider audience and Ignatiev writing his Ph.D. thesis.  Another recent book that covers much of the same territory as WORKING TOWARD WHITENESS is WHITENESS OF A DIFFERENT COLOR by Matthew Frye Jacobson, which I highly recommend.  Yet another valuable work in the field by a sociologist is THE ETHNIC MYTH: RACE, ETHNICITY AND CLASS IN AMERICA by Stephen Steinberg, which documents how ethnic/racial boundaries have been used to justify and enforce economic (class) subjugation in the U.S.	2005-08-31
US	52386663	RVCCHSEMYEVD7	0674016874	55275137	The Evolution-Creation Struggle	Books	2	9	15	N	N	Lots of historical data, but the overall argument fails	Michael Ruse fails to sustain his argument, I'm afraid, in THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE.  The title is misleading because it's not specific enough.  The story of the anti-Enlightenment/anti-Darwin fundamentalist backlash is not new, and Ruse doesn't attempt to add anything to it.  What IS new is the story Ruse tells of how \\"evolutionism\\" was also a reaction to the Enlightenment, a more optimistic reaction.  The best part of the book is Ruse's marshalling of evidence to this effect in the period prior to the Darwinian revolution.  And before I forget to say it, Ruse is not arguing that modern biology and the neo-Darwinian synthesis it's based on is not scientific.  What he is discussing is the wider metaphysical backdrop of the scientific theory of natural selection-plus-genetics.<br /><br /> But it's a classic case of a Procrustean bed -- Ruse tries to fit his intellectual history into the constraining concept that creationists are premillennialists and \\"evolutionists\\" are postmillennialists.  In other words, the liberal/progressive intellectuals and scientists can also be situated on the Christian metaphysical terrain -- they believe that it is up to humanity to perfect the world BEFORE Christ returns.  I just don't buy it.  The claim is too big and his evidence too scanty, indirect, and circumstantial.<br /><br /> There does seem to be some truth to a more general idea, which is far from original.  Max Weber, the great German sociologist, claimed that the Protestant work ethic continued to propel the accumulation of wealth even after the religious belief fell away (THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM).  And the process philosopher Alfred North Whitehead famously said that \\"[The Middle Ages] was the age of faith based upon reason.  [The 18th Century in Europe] was the age of reason, based upon faith.\\"  (SCIENCE AND THE MODERN WORLD, p. 57).  In other words, the structure of belief continues to inform thought even after belief fades.  But here is where Ruse goes wrong, in my view.  He elides the distinction, and claims that the BELIEF continues, and so calls \\"evolutionism\\" a form of religious belief, a postmillennial religious belief.<br /><br /> Some further thoughts on the flaws in Ruse's argument:<br />1) Darwin's theory of natural selection has always struck me as depressing.  Compelling, but depressing.  I am certainly not alone in this.  So there is a big problem with Ruse's insistence that \\"evolutionism\\" is necessarily an optimistic view.  This is one way that the observable facts do not fit his conceptual scheme.<br /><br />2) An increasingly influential faction among the evangelical/fundamentalists is known as the Dominionists -- James Dobson of Focus on the Family is the leading figure in this group.  The Dominionists are -- postmillennialists!  They are aspiring theocrats, who believe it the job of the Christians to take over the government and rule according to Old Testament principles in preparation for Christ's return.  This is another case where the observable facts do not support Ruse's theory of \\"fundamentalist premillennialists\\" versus \\"progressive postmillennialists.\\"<br /><br />3) Ruse has left many support structures out, and expects the premillennial/postmillennial concept alone to support the weight of his vast construct.  There is no discussion of liberal and conservative ideology, for instance, and how they have changed over time in the U.S. and the U.K., a glaring oversight.  Also missing is any examination of the idea of sociocultural evolution, a central concept in anthropology (it should be a central concept in sociology as well), which is not at all the same as biological evolution.  Ruse could make a much more cogent argument if he disentangled the two, but it would be a more complex argument.<br /><br /> I agree with Ruse's practical conclusions, that defenders of science should avoid bashing religion, as Richard Dawkins is prone to do, and that defenders of science should riseabove their differences to work together more effectively in keeping ID and other religious notions out of biology classes.  And fortunately the unconvincing historic argument of THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE is not necessary to either of those worthy aims.above their differences to work together more effectively in keeping ID and other religious notions out of biology classes.

Anthony Shadid provides a welcome glimpse into the lives, experience and views of ordinary Iraqis in NIGHT DRAWS NEAR.<br /><br />Shadid's unique advantage as a journalist is that he speaks Arabic -- he is an Arab-American from Oklahoma, from an Orthodox Christian Lebanese family.  Interestingly, he notes that as he has traveled back and forth, he feels more American when in Iraq, and more Arab when in America.<br /><br />He has no axe to grind -- Shadid does not engage in cheerleading for nor critique of the  Bush Administration.  He simply lets the Iraqis he speaks with present their own perspectives, which are diverse.  If there is a central theme, it is the sense of the historic importance and greatness of the city of Baghdad, one of the great centers of both the Arab world and the Islamic world, now fallen low.  A common refrain among its residents is &#34;Baghdad deserves better.&#34;  And one cannot read NIGHT DRAWS NEAR without wishing better for its people.<br /><br /> Salaam alay-kum.

Drawing on Whitehead's metaphysics (PROCESS AND REALITY), this section could have been expanded and the result would be a powerful 5-star work.  Unfortunately, Griffin then introduces a theistic God.  The rest of the book reads like fanciful medieval theology, the sort that treats how many angels can dance on the head of a pin as a serious question.  Thus, Griffin's aim of reworking theology so as to be compatible with science utterly fails.  I was quite open to Griffin's argument, but it may be that you have to share his a priori assumptions -- his theistic preconceptions.<br /><br />Of course Whitehead has a place for God in his metaphysics (God and Universe in a never-ending process of interaction, part of the overarching Creative Process), but Whitehead's God is a necessary metaphysical principle, not a personal God/Creator God such as the one Griffin is talking about.  Griffin's God seems to be drawn from Charles Hartshorne, the other foundational process philosopher.  Hartshorne believed the existence of God (personal Creator god) could be proved!  Not my sort of thinker by a metaphysical mile.<br /><br />I am much more impressed by Buddha's stance on the question of \\"God\\" -- he refused to address it, because he did not consider it to be a fruitful question.  The terms atheist and agnostic are both premised on the term theist, but the underlying concept is misguided, so none of it is at all helpful in understanding the nature of reality, or of liberation from suffering.<br /><br />The first three chapters of this book fit much better with anything by Whitehead (try [[ASIN:0684836394 Science and the Modern World]], [[ASIN:0029351707 Adventures of Ideas]], and Sherburne's [[ASIN:0226752933 A Key to Whitehead's Process and Reality]]) than with the rest of the book.

Ken Wilber has done amazing work as a synthetic philosopher, pulling together various insights into a vast metaphysical construct that he calls &#34;integral.&#34;  This, like many of his books, is a sort of synoptic overview of the Wilber Construct.  I read it when it was first published, a condensation of SEX, ECOLOGY, SPIRITUALITY.  For an even briefer summary of Wilber's system, see THE MARRIAGE OF SENSE AND SOUL.<br /><br /> What I want to address, though, is Brother Ken's apparent need to develop his compassion, which seems stunted by comparison to his intellect.  I just found a statement of Ken's on the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, which he posted to his website in 2003 (it can be found on the Shambhala Publications site), and which he apparently thinks highly enough of to have left there until now.  In it, Ken lashes out at the peace movement in a way betraying a lack of elementary decency and respect.<br /><br />His proposal, which is supposed to reflect his superior &#34;second-tier&#34; insight, is a world government, which is something I've seen the need for since I was about 13.  I don't think it took &#34;second-tier&#34; consciousness to figure it out.  Does Ken think most peace activists haven't also thought of that?  But what do we do without one when imperialist powers like the U.S. invade and occupy countries?  He places the peace movement and the neocon advocates of war on the same primitive moral plane, far beneath his lofty position, but based on his tirade I think it's clear who needs some intensive ethical development.<br /><br />Certainly developing &#34;compassion for all sentient beings&#34; would be a prerequisite to Brother Ken becoming any sort of philosopher-king with policy-making authority.  For a truly enlightened and compassionate perspective, I recommend LIVING BUDDHA, LIVING CHRIST by Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese Zen teacher and peace activist.	2005-08-07

Who is Matt Simmons?  He's a Houston investment banker who specializes in oil.  He's a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Council on Foreign Relations.  Not a radical environmentalist, in other words, quite the opposite.  What Simmons has done in TWILIGHT IN THE DESERT: THE COMING OIL SHOCK AND THE WORLD ECONOMY is to analyze the technical papers of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) on Saudi oil, shining a light behind the veil of secrecy that has shrouded it since OPEC stopped reporting oil production data in 1982.  In short, what the SPE reports reveal is that the official Saudi claims for reserves and production capacity are vastly overstated.  Further, tragically, it seems that the fields have been mismanaged, making it unlikely that all the oil will ever be recovered.<br /><br /> Now someone with a suspicious mind might suspect that Simmons, a banker, has an interest in leading the market to believe that oil is scarce, because that will put upward pressure on the price, and the oil companies and he, their banker, will benefit.  I do have a suspicious mind, but I am convinced by Simmons's meticulous presentation of the SPE data.  It is probably the single most important piece of evidence that the world is entering the Hubbert's peak for oil (\\"peak oil\\" as it is colloquially and ungrammatically known).  He systematically presents the data on every single big Saudi oilfield, from the biggest of all, Ghawar, which as of 1994 still produced 63% of all Saudi oil, through Abqaiq, Safnaya, Berri, Zulaf, Marjan, Shaybah, and smaller fields.<br /><br /> Are there vast untapped reserves in Saudi Arabia?  According to the SPE data, the answer is no.  No giant  fields have been discovered since 1968, despite intensive exploration.  Here is a list of crisp facts about world oil, according to Simmons (p. 331):<br /><br /> 1) Only a handful of super-giant oilfields have ever been discovered in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East -- they represent a very significant portion of all ME oil, and they are all very mature.<br /><br /> 2) All mature giant oilfields peak and decline (production profiles showing the peaks are shown for 8 fields in Texas, Alaska, the North Sea, and Russia).  Implication:  sophisticated new technology will not prevent or forestall this from happening.<br /><br /> 3) There do not seem to be many giant oilfields left to be discovered in Saudi Arabia or the ME.<br /><br /> 4) Non-OPEC oil, excluding the FSU (former Soviet Union) seems to be peaking, or has already peaked.<br /><br /> The consequences of all this, needless to say, are grim.  It's been increasingly clear in recent years that oil had peaked everywhere else, but there was still supposed to be a vast reserve under the Saudi sands.  Apparently this was a mirage.  What this means is that we have to make the development of new energy sources the top priority.

Here's the full quote:  &#34;Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist.&#34; --Kenneth E. Boulding<br /><br /> Deffeyes uses this as the epigraph for this book, highlighting the central divide on the oil issue, and the bigger energy and environment issues.  Mainstream economics is delusional, in a word, imagining that everything is infinitely substitutable.  (See ecological  economist Herman Daly for the best sustained treatment of this point.)  M. King Hubbert and the oil geologists who follow his trailblazing methodology, including Kenneth Deffeyes and Colin Campbell, are experts on the discovery and measurement of finite resources, and along with biologists stand utterly at odds with the metaphysical hocus-pocus of mainstream economics.<br /><br /> What does Deffeyes add to the small but rapidly growing information-base on oil depletion (&#34;peak oil&#34;) aimed at a popular audience?  Here are his chapter headings:  1) Why Look Beyond Oil?, 2) Where Oil Came From, 3) The Hubbert Method, 4) Mostly Gas, 5) Consider Coal, 6) Tar Sands, Heavy Oil, 7) Oil Shale, 8) Uranium, 9) Hydrogen, 10) The Big Picture.  It is pleasantly surprising how funny and entertaining Deffeyes makes all this!<br /><br /> He begins by going out on a limb and predicting the exact date of the global Hubbert's Peak for oil -- 11/24/05, Thanksgiving Day of THIS YEAR.  Of course this is just a dramatic gesture, but the point is that this is not a middle-term, let alone long-term, problem -- it is upon us, and even immediate action is way too late, compared to the sustained action that should have been take since the 1970s.  After a brief geological summary of where oil is found and how it forms (fascinating), he turns to Hubbert's method, which quite accurately predicted the peak of U.S. oil production.  Deffeyes presents a simplified form of calculating what for Hubbert was tremendously complex and understood by few.  Using data for A) production, B) discovery, and C) hits, production and cumulative production are projected, and a logistical curve fitted to the data, which results in the calcuation of a precise peak (Hubbert's peak) which represents the point at which 50% of the oil has been produced.  Deffeyes arrives at the date of late 2005/early 2006, but then adds a sobering point -- the point on the smooth curve of Hubbert's original U.S. prediction was 1976.  It was only clear in retrospect that the actual production peak occurred in 1970.  Now today, world oil production has been flat since 1998.  In other words, Deffeyes is suggesting that in reality, we may already be several years past the peak!<br /><br /> The bulk of the book is devoted to examining, with a geologist's expertise and a great sense of humor, various alternative fossil fuel sources.  Deffeyes takes a hard-headed approach.  He knows coal is a potential cause of runaway global warming, but he also knows the limits of other alternatives, and so advocates placing a high priority on developing the technology for removing sulphur, and for carbon sequestration (removing the carbon from coal, and producing hydrogen).  He examines tar sands, heavy oil, and oil shale and the serious problems involved in extracting useful energy from them.  As opposed to pie-in-the-sky optimists, he says he has included the production, discovery and hits of these sources in his Hubbert's Curve calculation, so there is no magic salvation from that source.  Finally, he reluctantly concludes that nuclear fission of uranium will have to be part of the response to oil depletion.  He does not propose solutions to the tremendous expense of building nuclear power plants, the risk of theft of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium by terrorists, or what to do with radioactive waste.<br /><br /> Deffeyes is a geologist, so I suppose it's unreasonable to expect him to cover renewable energy sources that are not fossil fuels, like solar, wind and  biofuels.  He does address hydrogen, though, and does not see much short-term potential.  What I take away from BEYOND OIL is the sobering realization that time is short, and that we need action on multiple fronts.  Technological and political obstacles combined mean that we will probably not come close to fulfilling the potential of the cleanest alternatives in time to make possible a smooth transition to the post-oil world.  We will probably have to live with increased use of both coal and nuclear fission in the transition (if we make it through) to a post-fossil fuels world.<br /><br /> But though we're not as powerful as the fossil fuel industries, we have to fight to bring about as much clean, renewable energy as we can, as fast as we can!d  biofuels.

There are many better and more constructive books on the problem of the impending global Hubbert's Peak for oil -- you could start with THE PARTY'S OVER by Heinberg or THE END OF OIL by Roberts (see my reviews of both).  The larger issue is cogently summarized complete with data and mathematical analysis in LIMITS TO GROWTH: THE 30-YEAR UPDATE (see my review).  Even if you think there's no hope for our Civilization, such as it is, you could read the much more constructive POWERDOWN by Heinberg, which examines scenarios for responding to the crisis, including positive community-based strategies.<br /><br /> But it seems premature to me to conclude that all hope is lost.  Hermann Scheer has written a powerful manifesto/strategy for renewable energy called THE SOLAR ECONOMY (see my review).  In light of his analysis, Kunstler's dismissal of solar power cannot be taken seriously.  Amory Lovins, who has been researching renewable energy since the 1970s, when he wrote the influential SOFT ENERGY PATHS, recently co-authored a book-length study called WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME, which was co-funded by the Pentagon.  Lovins presents a plan for ending U.S. dependency on foreign oil by 2025, reducing oil use by 50%, mainly through improved efficiency, and by developing biofuels (see my review for more detail).<br /><br /> Perhaps Kunstler thought this book might be optioned for a movie, a sort of Mad Max tale of civil war in the U.S. after the oil runs out.  That's how it should be treated -- as dystopian speculation.  One \\"peak oil\\" writer (Mike Ruppert) is heading for the hills, according to his website, having concluded that the end of the world will commence in 2007.  Personally, I was inclined toward survivalism in the 1970s, and I'm not playing that game.  Rather than wallow in despair, what we need is careful, strategic analysis, and bold action.<br /><br /> CARPE DIEM!<br /> CARPE DIEM!	2005-05-30

Amory Lovins has been pursuing energy efficiency and renewable energy since the 1970s, when he wrote the influential SOFT ENERGY PATHS.  That initiative was thrown off-track by the drop in oil prices in the 1980s.  Now Lovins is back in demand in the post-9/11 world with the global Hubbert's Peak for oil upon us.<br /><br /> This is not a radical strategy.  It is market-based, and is all based on existing technology.  According to Lovins and his co-authors,<br /><br /> \\"...it will cost less to displace all of the oil that the United States now uses than it will cost to buy that oil.  Oil's current market price leaves out its true costs to the economy, national security, and the environment.  But even without including those now \\"externalized\\" costs, it would still be profitable to displace oil competely over the next few decades.  In fact, by 2025, the annual economic benefit of that displacement would be $130 billion gross (or $70 billion net of the displacement's costs).\\"<br /><br /> WINNING THE OIL ENDGAME involves 4 shifts -- 1) doubling the efficiency of using oil, through measures such as ultralight vehicle design, 2) applying creative business models and public policies to speed the profitable adoption of superefficient light vehicles, heavy trucks and airplanes, 3) embarking on the crash development of biofuels, cellulosic ethanol in particular, and 4) applying efficiency measures to save 50% of the projected 2025 use of natural gas.<br /><br /> Lovins goes on to elaborate necessary policies, such as feebates as incentives for consumers, government acquisition plans, federal loan guarantees, and so forth.  He notes that while eminently practical and market-based, the plan will not benefit all companies.  He points to the examples of Shell and BP, oil companies that are in the process of tranforming themselves into energy companies, as models for success in this energy transition.  (see [...] for more)<br /><br /> I admit that I am not by nature optimistic about the human condition, but Amory Lovins is, and he always makes me feel more confident about the future.  Despair and fatalism produce nothing of value, so each and every one of us should join Amory Lovins and the Pentagon and fight for an end to foreign oil dependency, and fight for renewable energy!

This can be done well, but Garreau doesn't manage it here.  His \\"focus\\" is on GRIN technologies -- genetics, robots, information and nanotech.<br /><br />He presents three scenarios, a utopian Heaven, a dystopian Hell, and an odd, optimistic third one he calls Prevail.  Ray Kurzweil, no surprise, is the main figure in the Heaven scenario, (Kurzweil thinks it would be just swell to be transmogrified from carbon into silicon -- into computer software), while Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems is the central character in the Hell scenario.  As far as this goes, my view is decisively on the Hell side.  Joy is most concerned, according to Garreau, about the possibility of deadly genetically engineered plagues.<br /><br />Personally, I'm more concerned about the misuse of genetic engineering applied to human beings, which Garreau also addresses -- see the movie GATTACA for a glimpse of this dystopia -- and here I am in synch with Francis Fukuyama (see his OUR POSTHUMAN FUTURE).  The Prevail scenario is based on a rejection of techo-determinism, and maintains that since humans have muddled through this far, we'll probably muddle through again, exercising choice in the use of the GRIN genies.  Whistling in the dark?  The human species, now multiplied to the point of filling our finite planet, faces many problems that are utterly new -- it is a trite fallacy to think \\"muddling through\\" applies to any situation, forever.<br /><br /> Other than the breezy and non-systematic treatment of the topic(s), my main complaint is what is left out.  The index does not have a single entry for OIL.  The only entries for ENERGY are for topics related to cell chemistry, part of the discussion of genetic engineering.  ALL of these scenarios of futuristic technology are going to be severely affected by the looming Hubbert's Peak for oil.  Kurzweil's dreams and Joy's nightmares may never come to pass because we overshoot the ecosystem and civilization crashes.<br /><br /> Alternatively, *part* of civilization crashes, and what remains is reduced to a much lower standard of living, with little  energy or funding for cutting edge scientific research.  Part of the reason I see Joy's fears as much more compelling than Kurzweil's hopes, is that since the crash is likely not to happen all at once, the elites will manage to pursue genetic engineering even as much of the planet is reduced to (or remains in) a state of barbarism.  In the absence of the rapid development of renewable energy (and time is running out!), coal will most likely be used in large quantities again, leading to runaway global warming.  Perhaps the elites will genetically modify themselves in order to survive in the poisoned atmosphere.<br /><br />This book is very thin stuff, lacking in mental nutrients.  I recommend looking elsewhere, including Fukuyama's book and books on global warming/climate change and the clean/renewable energy transition.

This is a well-written insider's tale of the confirmed sightings of the ivory-billed woodpecker in Arkansas in 2004, which amazed all of us who are even remotely interested in birds and wildlife.  The last previous confirmed sighting was in 1944, in the NE corner of Louisiana, an area that was logged and destroyed later that year.  Interesting, then, that the rare bird, long thought extinct, shows up just upriver in Arkansas.<br /><br /> One of the things that makes Gallagher's book so good is his tracking down various unconfirmed sightings over the years.  In light of what we now know, that the ivory-bill lives!, these sightings become much more plausible in retrospect.  And there is a pattern that emerges -- sightings across southern Louisiana from west (Sabine River) to central (Atchafalaya Basin) to east (Pearl River).  A long-lost tape has been unearthed confirming a 1966 \\"sighting\\" (hearing) in the Sabine River area of east Texas.  The 850,000 acre Atchafalaya Basin was the location of several sightings in the 1970s and 1980s.  A highly credible 1999 sighting in the Pearl River area led to an intensive search that found nothing.  It is quite possible therefore, based on the evidence presented in this book, that the ivory-bill survives not only in the Cache and White River area of east-central Arkansas, but in the swamps of southern Lousiana as well!<br /><br /> What's the moral of the story?  Habitat preservation!  The area in Arkansas is protected land, which was expanded by Nature Conservancy purchases between the February 2004 sightings and the recent public announcement, and protecting critical habitat in the three river basins mentioned above might well secure more elusive ivory-bill populations.  Designation and protection of critical habitat is in fact mandated by the Endangered Species Act.<br /><br /> The two top websites for more on the amazing ivory-bill story are The Nature Conservancy ([...]) and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology ([...]).  And David Luneau, whose video is the crucial evidence for the bird's existence, has a website too ([...]), though the video footage is on the Cornell site.he crucial evidence for the bird's existence, has a website too ([...]), though the video footage is on the Cornell site.	2005-05-17

I always identified with Phil Lesh, who was the most intellectual of the Dead, and the most adventurous musically.  Learning years ago of Phil's involvement with avant-garde classical music planted the interest in my mind,  which I finally pursued in recent years after a long (and continuing) sojourn in the land of free jazz and improvisation.  SEARCHING FOR THE SOUND is a unique view of the Grateful Dead from the inside.  It is not as thorough as some of the other books that have been written, but it doesn't aim at completeness, and if you don't expect it, you won't be disappointed.  For more on the inimitably strange, visionary, inspiring and humorous thoughts of Phil, Jerry and the others, I recommend CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEAD.<br /><br /> In this 40th anniversary memoir, Phil shares fascinating details about his avant-classical interest.  I knew that Phil had studied composition with Luciano Berio at Mills College in the early '60s, but here we learn that Lesh was the Mills sound mixer, and participated in electronic performances of works by both Berio and Stockhausen.  He also mixed the tape sections of Berio's \\"Differences\\" for chamber quintet and tape at the Ojai Festival near Santa Barbara prior to joining Jerry in a rock band.  Phil claims that Charles Ives and Coltrane were huge influences -- Coltrane, sure, but Ives?  It wouldn't have occurred to me, but it makes perfect sense that Ives, the American maverick, with his juxtopositions of high and low, melody and dissonance, would be a hidden influence on the Dead.  Phil took the band to hear Ives's masterpiece, his Symphony No. 4, performed by the American Symphony Orchestra, Leopold Stokowski conducting, at Carnegie Hall in 1967, two years after its belated 1965 premiere.<br /><br />After marrying in the early '80s, Phil and his wife spent a week at Bayreuth in 1984 and took in the entire Ring cycle by Wagner!  The following year, Phil took Jerry to hear part of the Ring in San Francisco.  Phil has supported modern composers through the Rex Foundation, including a recording of the masterpiece \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" by the great American composer Elliott Carter (on Virgin Records, 1992 -- see my review), and recordings by the late British composer Robert Simpson, perhaps the greatest symphonist of the late 20th century.  Phil was invited to conduct a short Carter piece performed by the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in March, 1994.  I was quite happy to find that Phil shares my view of the Dead's most avant-garde recording:  \\"I've always felt that as an artistic statement ANTHEM OF THE SUN was our most innovative and far-reaching achievement on record.\\"<br /><br /> Other than these avant-classical details, the thing that most impressed me about SEARCHING FOR THE SOUND is the utopian vision that still shines through, as in the following quotes:<br /><br /> \\"It felt then as if we were an integral part of some cosmic plan to help transform human consciousness.\\" (333)<br /><br /> Of the 1965 music of the Acid Tests, and the formation of the group mind:  the energy is making the world better, \\"or at least holding the line against the depradations of entropy and ignorance.\\" (68)<br /><br /> \\"...in the brief shining moment a spirit was alive in the land: a spirit that blazed like a flaming heart, that could have (and should have) lit up the world.  Fear not -- that light still lives, peeking out through the cracks in the wall of our materialistic civilization.\\" (95)<br /><br /> Indeed it does, thanks in some small part to Phil's persistence of vision.

It focuses on \\"failures\\" of the CIA and intelligence-gathering, but includes NOTHING on the Office of Special Plans, the Lie Factory in the Pentagon that deliberately spun intel to support the neoconservative agenda of war-on-Iraq-no-matter-what and reported directly to Cheney.  The excellent Mother Jones article called \\"The Lie Factory\\" has yet to be expanded into a book as far as I know, but look for it on the Mother Jones website.  The best book on the subject is Bamford's [[ASIN:140003034X A PRETEXT FOR WAR]] (see my review).  The Carnegie Endowment for Peace was a source of excellent information debunking the Bush Administration's case for war long before the war was launched.  The idea that \\"everyone thought the threat was real\\" until the post-war discovery of no weapons is nonsense, nothing but post-hoc propaganda which serves to justify the war.<br /><br /> See [[ASIN:1565849027 HOODWINKED: The Documents that Reveal How Bush Sold Us a War]] by John Prados for a much better analysis of the \\"WMD\\" issue, with full documentation (see my review).  The very category WMD is a propaganda device which lumps nuclear weapons in with the much less dangerous chemical and biological weapons, thus magnifying the threat from the latter.  The mass media acceptance of the term WMD is one of the biggest victories of the neoconservatives.<br /><br /> There was a Senate committee report on the WMD intel that came out in the summer of 2004.  It was eclipsed in the media by the 9/11 report.  But that Senate committee report was supposed to have a follow-on, a Part 2, that examined the deliberate distortion of intel by the Bush Administration -- no surprise, the GOP-run Senate has never issued that report.<br /><br /> The \\"intel incompetence\\" line is very convenient for Bush and Cheney -- it absolves them of responsibility for an unnecessary war.  But it is far from a secret that they were itching for \\"regime change\\" in Iraq from the day they occupied the levers of power.  Was the Pentagon Office of Special Plans a hallucination, or did Feith report to Cheney with intel cooked to support an invasion?

Reza Aslan's book is slightly longer (270 pages to 190), but also more thorough and with a more up-to-date and hopeful perspective on the ongoing \\"evolution and future\\" of the religion.  There are a multitude of prevalent misconceptions about Islam which these books correct, including 1) Islam is monolithic, 2) Islam is inherently violent, and 3) Islam discourages learning and critical thought.  There is an entire right-wing fundamentalist christian industry that churns out such lies, and which tirelessly promotes a Holy War against the \\"Muslim infidels.\\"  The Christian fanatics are the mirror image of the Muslim fanatics!<br /><br /> Aslan is a religious scholar, born in Iran, and a liberal Muslim, now teaching at the University of Iowa.  His analysis, which I find quite convincing, is that we are now living through the Islamic Reformation, comparable to the Christian (usually called Protestant) Reformation.  Just as many of the early Protestants were militant and intolerant, and engaged in Holy War against what they saw as the corrupt and oppressive Roman church, so today there are similar movements in Islam.  And just as those movements eventually led to the Enlightenment and the development of secular liberal societies (which the christian fundamentalists would like to destroy!), so might the militant Islamic movements of our time lead to a similar development in the Islamic world to come.<br /><br /> Controversial?  Yes.  Hopeful?  Yes.  And if you don't find his view of the future convincing, most of the book is invaluable nonetheless for its history of Islam in all its variety.  I will very likely adopt this book as a text for either the Sociology of Social Movements and/or the Sociology of Religion next year.	2005-04-22

The author, Steve Jones, is a genetics professor at University College London, so he is well qualified for this project. Every chapter is packed with fascinating examples of the mechanisms of \\"descent with modification through natural selection.\\"  While Jones makes clear where gaps have been filled in Darwin's theorizing, modern biology has mainly vindicated Darwin in every chapter, and has built on his amazing insights.<br /><br /> I thoroughly enjoyed Jones's style, which is infused with mordant wit.  Over the years I have tried to read Darwin's great work more than once, and my eyes have glazed over.  It is considered great literature by some, and I know it contains some beautiful phrases, but I found Jones to be far more entertaining.  With DARWIN'S GHOST he joins Gould and Dawkins as one of the leading popularizers of biology of our times.  This book claims a place on a very short list of essential books for any non-biologist who wants to gain a basic understanding of evolutionary biology in the early 21st century.<br /><br /> [NEWSFLASH -- the school board in Kansas is trying to downgrade evolution again -- it may be the Earth is flat, the sun revolves around the Earth, the Earth is only 6000 years old, and there is no such thing as evolution.

If you're a Biblical literalist with a \\"God said it, I believe it, that settles it\\" bumper sticker on your car or on your mind, you won't be amused by Spong's latest volley against intolerant dogmatism.  But if you think you have a brain for a good reason, and prefer keeping it turned on and using it, you might well find this a very useful compendium of the passages in the Bible used to justify repression, oppression, persecution, exploitation, war, pogroms, genocide, hatred and evil through the ages.  There are chapters on the Bible and 1) the environment, 2) women, 3) homosexuality, 4) children, and 5) anti-Semitism.<br /><br /> It's fantastically interesting what the literalist/fundamentalist/evangelicals choose to pay attention to in the Bible and what they choose to ignore.  THOU SHALT NOT KILL (Deuteronomy 5:17) and Jesus's teaching to LOVE YOUR ENEMIES (Matthew 5:44), and RESIST NOT EVIL, BUT WHOSOEVER SHALL SMITE THEE ON THY RIGHT CHEEK, TURN TO HIM THE OTHER ALSO (Matthew 5:39) are somehow always overlooked.<br /><br /> His preachings against wealth accumulation are left out of the right-wing version as well -- if you paid attention to them, I'm not sure how you could be a Republican:  LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES IN HEAVEN, WHERE NEITHER MOTH NOR RUST DOTH CORRUPT, AND WHERE THIEVES DO NOT BREAK THROUGH NOR STEAL: FOR WHERE YOUR TREASURE IS, THERE WILL BE YOUR HEART ALSO (Matthew 6: 20-21), YE CANNOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON (Matthew 6: 24), and SELL WHATSOEVER THOU HAST, AND GIVE TO THE POOR, AND THOU SHALT HAVE TREASURE IN HEAVEN: AND COME, TAKE UP THE CROSS, AND FOLLOW ME (Mark 10: 21).<br /><br />These are radical ideas, to be sure, and very hard to follow.  But as far as I can tell, the Christian right-wingers aren't even trying, because they haven't heard the message.  Sadly they conclude that waging war on the heathen and tax cuts for the wealthy are good Christian policies.

Unfortunately, as the Mel Gibson movie showed, anti-Jewish views are still all too common, so step outside of  judgemental, self-righteous thinking and learn the Jewish perspective!<br /><br /> The negative reviews of this book are uninformed -- Klinghoffer is a conservative Jew with enough respect for himself and others to write a thoughtful book on a topic many would prefer not to address.  One controversial claim he makes is that if the Jewish people had accepted Jesus as Messiah, Christianity would not have come about, nor the entire Western Civilization based on Christianity.  This is perfectly reasonable, because the notion of a Jewish Messiah was limited to the Jewish people and their liberation, not all of humanity, so under those circumstances there would have been no \\"universal\\" Christianity, just Judaism with a restored Kingdom.<br /><br /> Klinghoffer analyzes in detail the claims made by some of Jesus's followers (most notably Matthew) that Jesus fulfilled Jewish prophecy, and effectively rebuts them.  It is not necessary to agree, only to recognize that there are perfectly good reasons that these claims were not convincing to most Jews.<br /><br /> For another book on the relationship between the Jewish people and early Christianity, a great work of historical sociology, see Rodney Stark's THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY.	2005-04-06

It stormed the pop charts, unprecedented for a 6-minute song, and reached #2 in the USA.  What was #1, you ask?  It was the Beatles' \\"Help!\\"  Al Kooper's story of how he ended up playing organ is quite amusing, and Dylan's recruitment and use of Michael Bloomfield in the session is fascinating.  Also superb is Marcus's account of the ensuing tour of the new electric Dylan, with the booing in the U.S. and the large-scale disruption of the U.K. concerts, some of it quite purposefully organized by the old British Communist Party, as it turns out, which controlled a network of stodgy folk clubs. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was the last song every night on that tour, a perfect howl of anger for Dylan to wreak vengeance on his recalcitrant fans. (See my 9/5/04 review of the LIVE 1966 disc, the official release of the famous \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" bootleg of the Manchester concert.)<br /><br /> Once you realize the scope of Marcus's musings, it becomes clear that this book could have been much longer.  He never devotes any attention to the fact that the song was an existentialist anthem, for instance, which might have involved analysis of the existentialists and their influence on Dylan.  He doesn't have much to say about the class resentment that drives much of the song's powerful angry energy, or the vast and growing inequality in the the U.S. that might make that resentment more and more relevant at 40 years on, as the old New Deal programs are under full-scale assault by the president and congress.  Dylan himself said \\"I was hungry, and it was your world\\" (\\"Just Like a Woman\\"), he also said \\"Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough\\" (\\"Tangled Up In Blue\\"), both references to the fact that he, a middle class boy, had entered a higher status world, and experienced class resentment.<br /><br />Much could have been made of the social context of the Vietnam War, and Dylan's refusal to address it.  The turn from the left-wing politics of his folk period (for civil rights, against war) to the apolitical, surrealist stance he took in 1964-5 is never seriously tackled.  Some of Marcus's musings are quite idiosyncratic -- of all the music that has followed \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" he chooses the Village People and the Pet Shop Boys for special treatment.  I would have chosen at least a thousand others first, but there you go, it's a wide world for cultural influence, and there's 40 years to work with.  He mentions, and includes the entire text of, a great old early '70s comedy skit that they used to play on WXRT in Chicago with Dylan pitching a K-Tel album of Golden Protest.  An Italian rap group's version of The Song from MASKED AND ANONYMOUS is analyzed at some length.<br /><br />I can now easily imagine books about Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" quite different from this one.  But they haven't been written.  I'll close with a quote from Dylan himself from 2004:<br /><br /> \\"It's like a ghost is writing a song like that.  It gives you the song, and then it goes away, it goes away.\\"g inequality in the the U.S. that might make that resentment more and more relevant at 40 years on, as the old New Deal programs are under full-scale assault by the president and congress.

It is not an empirical claim, that's what's wrong with it -- it is nothing more than metaphysical bravado.  Do not look to this book for answers to your hard-headed practical questions about energy sources -- there are none to be found.  THE BOTTOMLESS WELL is pitched at a high level of abstraction, and combines techno-optimism and free market euphoria in that peculiarly American way that is sure to garner a dustjacket blurb from George Gilder (it did, sure enough).  Just have FAITH in Technology and Free Enterprise, brothers and sisters!<br /><br /> Mills was trained in physics, and there are some interesting things to be found when the metaphysical assumptions are stripped away (hence two stars instead of one).  But given that the business community is following the science toward renewable energy and away from global warming and fossil fuels, Huber & Mills seem to be a bit slow on the uptake.  Like most physicists, they are still enraptured by the dream of nuclear fusion, which they imagine to be a virtually limitless source of energy.  Actually, they don't go out on a limb and say much about fusion (see p. 181), but their valorization of lasers is the clue.  Unfortunately for this dream, fusion is not likely ever to clear the EROEI threshold (energy returned on energy invested).<br /><br />They are also fond of oil shale and tar sand, despite that fact that the EROEI is prohibitive, not to mention that the vast tailings from extracting the oil (from places like Alberta) leaves the environment devastated.  (It is perhaps worth noting that the cover of the book is misleading -- nowhere do they claim that the supply of *oil* is unlimited.)<br /><br /> Reading THE BOTTOMLESS WELL makes me wonder if bacteria in a petri dish growing rapidly toward the carrying capacity of their environment might not feel a similar euphoria and tell one another \\"we will never run out of energy!\\"<br /><br /> For a bracing alternative to this magic potion, try Hermann Scheer's THE SOLAR ECONOMY (see my review) as the most cogent presentation of how to move rapidly toward a sustainable future based on renewable energy.ng alternative to this magic potion, try Hermann Scheer's THE SOLAR ECONOMY (see my review) as the most cogent presentation of how to move rapidly toward a sustainable future based on renewable energy.	2005-02-09

This is another great contribution to the public's understanding of crucial issues from the UCLA geographer Jared Diamond.  COLLAPSE is an examination of several societies that have collapsed (including Easter Island, the Vikings in Greenland, and the Mayas), as well as a few that have solved their ecological problems and succeeded.  As in GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL, his previous Pulitzer Prize-winning book, Diamond takes a big-picture view.  The lesson is clear -- we must take action to avoid the collapse of our interdependent global society.  \\"Our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course,\\" observes Diamond (p. 498).<br /><br /> My only criticism of this fine book is that it devotes nearly 500 pages to examining various collapses of the past, and only a brief section at the end to examine our present crisis.  In Chapter 16 Diamond presents a summary of the evidence that we are in a condition of overshoot, and in danger of collapse if we stay on our present course.  He says we need 1) long-term planning, and 2) a reconsideration of core values, in order to avoid going the way of the Mayas.<br /><br />I would recommend that everyone who reads COLLAPSE also read [[ASIN:193149858X LIMITS TO GROWTH: The 30-Year Update]] (see my review), which presents a much more thorough summary of the evidence Diamond mentions in his concluding chapter, and [[ASIN:1597260657 THE UPSIDE OF DOWN: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization]], by political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon.  Once informed of our situation, a crucial book pointing toward the necessary answers is [[ASIN:1844070751 THE SOLAR ECONOMY]] by Hermann Scheer (see my review).	2005-01-09

That is true, and if I was confident that Crichton's latest would be taken for no more than what it is, another slick, shallow piece of entertainment suitable for long (or short) flights, there would be absolutely no problem.  But Crichton has apparently decided to promote the agenda of a small minority of industry-supported scientists, as well as libertarians, who say that global warming is a big hoax.  I believe this is dangerous propaganda, fiction or not, and therefore offer these alternative sources of information:<br /><br /> 1) THE DISCOVERY OF GLOBAL WARMING (Weart)<br /><br /> 2) GLOBAL WARMING: THE COMPLETE BRIEFING (Houghton -- IPCC),<br /><br /> 3) LABORATORY EARTH (Schneider), and<br /><br /> 4) [[ASIN:193149858X LIMITS TO GROWTH, THE 30-YEAR UPDATE]] (Meadows et al) -- see my 12/6/04 review.<br /><br /> Global warming is quite real, and the evidence that human economic activity has caused at least some of it since the beginning of the industrial revolution, by pumping vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, is overwhelming, according to the vast majority of scientists.  The scientific consensus can be found in the reports of:<br /><br />5) the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change website.<br /><br /> Therefore shifting from fossil fuels to clean/renewable energy as rapidly as possible is an absolutely crucial priority for humanity and the rest of life on Earth.	2004-12-16

It's been 30 years since the publication of the original LIMITS TO GROWTH, and according to the updated computer model (World3), overshoot and collapse is still the most likely outcome of current trends -- too many humans, consuming too much and polluting too much, are already in a condition of overshoot (by about 20%), and will most likely go charging on until crashing back to Earth, with population and consumption reduced back beneath the carrying capacity of the environment.  Using World3 and a mountain of data, the authors show that improved technologies and efficient markets, while necessary, will not be sufficient to prevent overshoot and collapse -- it will also be necessary to radically restructure society to reduce our reckless squandering of the Earth's resources.<br /><br /> The book is full of data and analysis, and while not technically challenging, is not easy reading.  But LIMITS is required reading for every human on the planet!  It is certainly depressing, especially knowing that the message was not heeded in the Seventies, and it is still not being heeded in the Aughts.  But despair is no more constructive than complacency -- those of us who have woken up to the crisis have got to act -- CARPE DIEM!<br /><br /> One of the authors, Donella Meadows, died before this third edition was completed.  Dana was a tireless and infectious optimist, who never stopped spreading the word that we have to change our way of life if humanity and the other forms of life we share the planet with are to survive.<br /><br /> Read this book, share it with others, and do SOMETHING to promote the needed transition to an ecologically sustainable country and world.

Kept in the dark and fed David Horowitz?  This book is a load of nonsense, and the only people who take it seriously are those who are completely ignorant of the subject matter, and so lack the ability to challenge Horowitz's outrageous claims, or don't care whether it's accurate or not, and just rabidly seize on any attack on the left (Coulter, Hannity, Savage, etc).<br /><br /> So Horowitz claims that the liberal left supports fundamentalist Islam.  This is quite a joke, but let's look at some evidence.<br /><br /> 1) Who supports Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda?  Well, the operation began as part of the effort to arm the Islamic mujahadin to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s.  Reagan's CIA channelled arms through the Pakistani secret service, the ISI, while the Saudis matched U.S. support.  Osama and the \\"Afghan arabs\\" were in the thick of this U.S.-backed support for the most bloodthirsty and medieval Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan.  Did the liberal left support the mujahedin or Osama?  No way!<br /><br /> 2) Notice in the story of the creation of al Qaeda the role of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.  The Saudi family, which rules the country that bears their name, adheres to Wahhabi Islam, one of the most fundamentalist varieties.  It spreads this intolerant form of Islam around the world, and funds al Qaeda and al Qaeda-like groups.  Does the liberal left support any of this?  No way!  But the U.S. government is a major friend and ally of the Kingdom.  Why?  OIL, of course!<br /><br /> 3) What about Pakistan?  The ISI and the military, which rule Pakistan, are strongly influenced by fundamentalist Islam.  The regime promotes the fundamentalists fighting in Kashmir.  The U.S. supports the regime.  What about the liberal left?  It doesn't support the Pakistani regime, it supports democracy and an end to the control of the big landowners and the military.<br /><br /> 4) What about the Taliban?  Did the liberal left support them?  No way!  The Taliban is an organization formed in Pakistan among the Pashtun people, who also live in Afghanistan.  It was strongly supported by the Pakistani government, which is supported by the U.S. government.  The liberal left supports democracy and womens' rights.  The U.S. government only really cares about two things in Afghanistan -- A) the presence of Osama, and B) a good route for oil and gas from Turkmenistan to South Asian markets that does not go through Iran.  Karzai signed a deal for a U.S. pipeline as soon as he was installed by the U.S. back in late 2001.<br /><br /> 5) What about Israel and Palestine?  The liberal left has supported the Palestinian people's legitimate rights.  After all, their land was stolen from them in 1948.  But the liberal left certainly does not support Hamas, the fundamentalist Islamic organization.  The only reason Hamas has grown so strong is because of the intransigence of the governments of Israel and the U.S.<br /><br /> The liberal left stands for values diametrically opposed to fundamentalism of any sort, whether Islamic, Christian, Jewish, libertarian, or otherwise.  Horowitz has evidently learned from both Goebbels, who taught the effectiveness of the Big Lie repeated often, and Orwell, who depicted thought control using slogans such as \\"War Is Peace,\\" \\"Slavery Is Freedom,\\" and the one Horowitz seems to revel in, \\"Ignorance is Strength.\\"<br /><br /> I challenge Horowitz's dittoheads to deal with these specific points rather than engage in more mindless cheerleading.the liberal left support them?

The CFR, the Council on Foreign Relations, was formed by the international wing of U.S. capital after the League of Nations fell apart and inter-imperialist collaboration proved ineffective, leading to WWII.  The farsighted few took measures to see that such a debacle did not recur.  The CFR, the \\"imperial brain trust\\" of the title, carried out research concerning the optimal strategy for the U.S. in the war.  They identified a minimum and maximum \\"Grand Area\\" that the U.S. needed to control, based on an assessment of factors including raw materials, and decided long before Pearl Harbor that the U.S. would need to control the Pacific Basin.  War with Japan was the plan, with or without Pearl Harbor.  Everything that happened in Europe was secondary to this consideration.<br /><br />The CFR Grand Area planning team was imported wholesale into FDR's State Department -- it became the State Department and directed the war strategy.  So the U.S. was not in the war to defend itself, or to fight for Freedom, or to liberate anyone, cherished propaganda to the contrary.  The goal was to seize as big a chunk of the globe as possible along with its raw materials and markets.  This proved quite successful, of course, and with a few pesky holdouts that were encircled and attacked with variations on containment and rollback over the years, the U.S. Empire replaced the 19th century British Empire, with an unprecedented military reach and military bases everywhere.  Since 1945 the sun has never set on the American Empire.<br /><br /> The name Noam Chomsky is much better known than Shoup & Minter, and Chomsky's analysis draws heavily on their groundbreaking research.  The original source material from the CFR's study project is archived in the library of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, just north of Chicago.  It goes without saying that this book is just as timely as ever.  For anyone still hypnotized by the sugar-coated lies about the reasons for the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, thinking that we are the selfless Caped Crusaders for Justice, this book is the wakeup call.  No, there is no Santa Claus, and no, the U.S. is not \\"doing God's will\\" when it continuously invades country after country.  It is the most powerful Empire in history, currently taking action to secure control of the remaining and fast-diminishing reserves of OIL.<br /><br /> This is why, all the fulminations of lobotomized Republicans to the contrary, there is such strong bipartisan unity in U.S. foreign policy.  The disagreements are all over tactics -- the basic imperial strategy is never in question, and any presidential candidate who does question it, whether from the Right (Buchanan) or the Left (McGovern, Dean) is preemptively defeated by the united efforts of the American ruling class.  Of course there was that exception, JFK, and for that there are other methods....  It goes without saying that this book is just as timely as ever.

What makes it different from other recent books covering some or part of the same story is Friedman's confident claim to have the secret inside story of what has REALLY happened.  He starts by saying he will use cool, geostrategic analysis and assume that players in international politics are rational and that they attempt to act strategically like chess players.  Statecraft is realpolitik, power politics, and morality is a weapon in the form of propaganda.  Fair enough.  One of the strengths of this Machiavellian approach is that it assumes that all governments lie to their people.  The truth needs a bodyguard of lies.<br /><br /> Using this approach, Friedman is able to make some sense out of the seemingly idiotic actions of the Bush Administration in its so-called \\"war on terror,\\" which is really a war on Islamic extremism in the form especially of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda and its affiliates.  He assumes that the \\"WMD threat\\" and  the \\"Saddam/Osama link threat\\" were/are propaganda used to secure the backing of the public for invading Iraq.  Of course Wolfowitz came right out and told us this.  The preposterous notion that the war was to liberate the Iraqi people scarcely deserves mention.  Only the truly gullible would fall for that.<br /><br /> The big problem comes when Friedman, at the end of the book, reveals the REAL reason for the invasion & occupation of Iraq -- he says the purpose was/is to pressure the Saudis into joining the U.S. war on al Qaeda.  Also to show wavering governments and Islamic militants that the U.S. is tough and shouldn't be messed with.  And finally, to project U.S. power throughout the Middle East and Southwest Asia.  Obviously, none of this would make good public propaganda.  The reader is left with the impression that the Bush Administration is really fiendishly smart, and only appears to be a bunch of arrogant lying bumblers.  But then of course the very last part of this recently completed book notes how the brilliant Iraq war plan is coming apart, and so maybe it's actually a double deceit.<br /><br />  It seems obvious to me that the Emperor Has No Clothes -- the simple reality driving everything about U.S. policy in the Middle East since World War II, let alone 2001, is OIL.  Since Friedman doesn't emphasize this at all, focusing rather on al Qaeda, I can only conclude that he too is part of the deception, the psy-ops, the for-public-consumption propaganda.  After all, what is StratFor but an off-the-shelf privatized CIA, or Office of Special Plans?  If he's a player, then why should we believe him?  Why would he share a REAL secret with ordinary mortals like us?<br /><br /> The U.S. military is the Oil Police.  That's the real truth stripped of its bodyguard of lies.  Do you think that if you could see the innermost secret planning documents it would be anything other than how to secure and guarantee the supply of oil that keeps the U.S. and \\"Western Civilization\\" running?  The #1 target for serious enemies is the Saudi oil.  Whether the invasion & occupation of Iraq was the best plan to accomplish this is another story -- most strategic analysts see it as a huge blunder by the Bush Administration -- but it seems crystal clear that the goal was/is to create a loyal client state in Iraq, complete with permanent U.S. bases to replace Saudi bases, one that will give top priority to U.S. oil firms to extract the second largest oil reserves in the world.  That cool, geostrategic, realpolitik analysis is oddly missing from Friedman's book.  And if you think about it, would your typical SUV-driving American have it any other way?<br /><br />DECEMBER 2013 UPDATE<br />Now that WikiLeaks has revealed Stratfor's work for Big Oil, spying on environmentalists and others challenging the oil industry's profits, we can scarcely be surprised that Friedman would completely minimize the central role of Oil in U.S. foreign policy.f Oil in U.S. foreign policy.	2004-10-08

He sees capitalist globalization as a great thing, and wants to Connect the Disconnected to the \\"Functioning Core\\" of the modern capitalist world, not to exploit them, as in world-system theory, but to liberate them.  The \\"Gap,\\" which is what he calls that part of the world being left behind in the current wave of globalization, is the source of the new post-9/11 threats, according to Barnett, and the Pentagon needs to finally shift its force structure from fighting the Soviet Union to fighting in the Gap, as part of a grand strategy of \\"shrinking the Gap.\\"  It's easy to see the appeal of this to the Pentagon, once they get past the inertia and sunk costs of the old force structure.  It gives the military something to do, and something to justify a massive budget, bureaucracy and power.<br /><br /> Barnett is an enthusiastic supporter of the Bush Administration's invasion and occupation of Iraq, and he basically wants to extend operations in Afghanistan and Iraq across the globe.  Reading Barnett induces temporary euphoria, as he dazzles the reader with a vision of the U.S. ending world poverty and bringing about Kantian universal peace.  Then the realization sets in that Barnett wants to colonize a huge chunk of territory for an indefinite period of time.  Of course he doesn't call it colonization, and he is adamant that it is not imperialism either.  But Barnett's book and Niall Ferguson's COLOSSUS (see my 4/26/04 review) are a matched set in every respect except their terminology.  Oh, and one other respect -- Ferguson realizes that the U.S. is unlikely to foot the bill for his proposal to emulate the British Empire in the 21st century, while Barnett seems either blissfully unaware of this, or perhaps agrees with the Bush Administration that it can be done on debt and the promise of an inflow of capital from grateful allies.<br /><br /> Barnett, like Ferguson, is a cheerful imperialist.  He has true faith, he believes that the U.S. Empire will \\"set everybody free\\" just like in the Randy Newman song \\"Political Science.\\"  He proposes creating a \\"System Administration,\\" basically a global colonial administration, alongside the fighting forces of the military.  I'm sure he's sincere (unlike the Straussian  neoconservatives he is allied with in his global democratic crusade), but post-9/11 military operations are not likely to be supported on the basis he proposes.  He doesn't seem to factor in the consistent U.S. support for bloodthirsty dictatorships throughout the so-called \\"Cold War.\\"  He doesn't seem to see that Americans prefer massive bombing campaigns to protracted nation-building.  He doesn't seem to notice that the country has been lurching away from the New Deal's commitment to the collective good and toward rampant greed and callousness since the rise of the so-called \\"conservatives\\" of the Republican Party under Reagan, Gingrich and the Bushes.  Americans are no longer willing to sacrifice for the common good of one another -- how does he expect them to sacrifice for the greater good of humanity in general (in Hume's terminology), especially the very ones who see the U.S. as the great evil power of the planet, the Evil Empire?  Think about this -- if Americans had been willing to support Barnett's magnanimous, selfless vision over the last several decades, 9/11 would never have happened!  Americans seem capable of action only in response to FEAR of a threat, real or imagined.  What Barnett wants, basically a proactive, massive Marshall Plan for what used to be called the Third World, complemented by vigorous and constant military operations, needs an America that doesn't exist.<br /><br /> If that wasn't bad enough, there are two more major problems with Barnett's rosy vision -- 1) competition among core powers, and 2) energy -- the oil is running out.He brushes over both,  scarcely addressing the first, and dismissing energy with a wave of the free market magic wand -- \\"China needs energy, so it will have to pay market price for it.\\"  The U.S. military is supposed to subdue and democratize and liberate the impoverished Gap for the good not only of the U.S., but of the entire Core.  Nice for the rest of the core countries!  Barnett must have skipped the course on Realist Theory at Harvard.  Treating the Functioning Core as a unitary entity as opposed to a group of competing powers is not realistic, in either the everyday or theoretical meaning of the word.  This oversight might be minor if there was no doubt U.S. dominance will last for a couple of generations, but the global Hubbert's Peak for oil is going to be upon us no later than 2020.  Competition for control of oil is already the source of Great Power rivalry, and this is certain to get uglier in the very near future.  I see this as one of Barnett's greatest oversights.  If energy supplies were infinite, perhaps we could make Barnett's triumphal move from Hobbes to Kant's universal peace via Lockian laws (rule-sets) over the course of the 21st century.  But as I see it, we're drifting toward catastrophe (as Einstein put it), unless our Grand Strategy becomes a global move to renewable energy.He brushes over both,  scarcely addressing the first, and dismissing energy with a wave of the free market magic wand -- \\"China needs energy, so it will have to pay market price for it.\\"  The U.S. military is supposed to subdue and democratize and liberate the impoverished Gap for the good not only of the U.S., but of the entire Core.

GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is a fine compendium of writings by and for global justice activists, or just activists generally.  With 488 pages and 33 chapters, full of great black & white photos and drawings, it is a veritable encyclopedia.  The book is divided into 3 sections:<br /><br /> 1) What's the problem? (political analysis)<br /><br /> 2) How to change things (tactics and strategies for change), and<br /><br /> 3) Ideas in action (examples of various movements).<br /><br /> The editor, David Solnit, is a Bay Area activist with long years of experience, going back to the Bay Area Peace Test of the late 1980s.  He was a key organizer of the successful nonviolent shutdown of the WTO (World Trade Organization) meeting in Seattle in November/December, 1999.  Solnit works as a carpenter in Oakland, enough to keep him on the frontlines of a constant stream of NVA (nonviolent direct action) campaigns.  In his editor's note, he says:<br /><br /> \\"As a carpenter, I have packed this book like a toolbelt, with the most useful and practical tools:  ideas and understandings of how to uproot the system causing our problems and build a better world... ...This book is a resource, but does not offer a repeatable blueprint, roadmap or recipe for the changes our planet so desperately needs.\\"<br /><br /> Of course if it did offer The Answer, you can bet that it would be VERY hard to find, and that everyone who desires progressive change would be circulating bootleg copies!  But GLOBALIZE LIBERATION offers plenty of insight into making radical change from people who've been trying to make it.  Most of the authors are unsung grassroots activists, but there are contributions from Walden Bello, Starhawk, Naomi Klein, George Lakey, and Elizabeth Martinez, all of whom are widely published and well-known in progressive circles.  (No Rage Against the Machine, though, Amazon description to the contrary!)<br /><br /> The book makes no claim to represent the entire global justice movement -- certainly there are no contributions from conservative opponents of globalization such as Pat Buchanan.  But neither are there contributions from the AFL-CIO, or such leading organizations as Public Citizen, the Institute for Policy Studies, or any of the Big 10 environmental groups.  Solnit and his contributors basically fall into two categories -- anarchist/antiauthoritarians, and grassroots/populist organizers.  The word anarchism, oddly enough, is not used overly much by the contributors -- but the basic approach is clear enough from the Introduction.  Solnit says \\"[t]he new radicalism is a movement of movements, a network of networks, not merely intent on changing the world, but -- as the Zapatistas describe -- making a new one in which many worlds will fit.\\"  He goes on to distinguish this radicalism from the hierarchical/authoritarian Left of the 20th century -- I'll leave it to you to judge whether the movements of GLOBALIZE LIBERATION are really \\"beyond left and right,\\" as he suggests, or are best thought of as an antiauthoritarian left.  Here are the common principles Solnit sees in the new radicalism:<br /><br /> \\"...the commitment to uprooting the system that is the cause of our social and ecological problems; doing it ourselves with people power and direct action; making change without taking power; practicing direct democracy in our resistance and in the world we create; and making our efforts a laboratory of resistance, creating new language and new forms of struggle.\\"<br /><br /> So the vision, while loose and diverse, is basically a vision of direct democracy and nonviolent direct action -- as Solnit says, \\"[a] common theme within the new radicalism is the practice of letting the means determine the ends.\\"  Groups like Public Citizen and the IPS, which are liberal or social democratic in orientation, are tactical allies of \\"the new radicalism,\\" but ultimately have different aims.  There are examples in the book from various protests, many in the U.S.,but also elsewhere, including the U.K., Italy, Argentina, Mexico (of course, the Zapatistas), and Serbia.  The book avoids any lengthy debate over the tactical issue (where exactly is the boundary on nonviolent action?), but stakes out a clear position in favor of NVA, particularly notable with the inclusion of Lakey, a long-time proponent of Gandhian nonviolent strategy.  Lakey was an influential voice in the successful movement to remove Milosevich from power in Serbia, and the book includes his account of Otpor, the student movement which used creative non-cooperation tactics.  The fact that the CIA & U.S. Endowment for Democrcy also backed Otpor is not addressed, though apparently the Otpor leaders minimize this and say the U.S. intel support was not critical, nor did it guide their objectives (this is from Lakey via the editor).<br /><br /> GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is an excellent, up-to-date primer on \\"the new radicalism.\\"  It isn't the only one, though -- see my \\"Tools for Activists Against Global Capital\\" for more.  The 4 that are most similar to the present volume are WE ARE EVERYWHERE, CONFRONTING CAPITALISM, ANTI-CAPITALISM, and A MOVEMENT OF MOVEMENTS.<br /><br /> Given the crisis we face -- and I personally am most concerned about the ecological crisis, and the fact that the oil is running out without any concerted plan for a transition to renewable energy -- the activism of GLOBALIZE LIBERATION is a source of hope.

He was the head of the CIA's Osama bin Laden unit in the late '90s, was interviewed as \\"Mike\\" in Coll's book [[ASIN:B001RNI20E GHOST WARS]] (see my review), and is still a CIA analyst.  Most of us by now have figured out that he is Mike Scheuer.  Sun Tzu said \\"know yourself, know your enemy,\\" and Scheuer's main goal in IMPERIAL HUBRIS is to share what he knows about Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, arguing that the official view is totally and dangerously wrong.  It seems to me that Scheuer is for the most part right on target with his critique.  There is one major problem with his proposal for what to do about it, which I will address below.<br /><br /> Here is a list of Scheuer's main points:<br /><br /> 1) Osama bin Laden (OBL) is neither an evil madman or just a criminal -- he is a highly competent, religiously motivated, charismatic leader who we had best take seriously.<br /><br /> 2) Al Qaeda is not a terrorist organization, but is rather part of and attempting to lead a global Muslim insurgency.<br /><br /> 3) OBL & Al Qaeda are not opposed to the U.S. because of \\"who we are,\\" (ie, \\"we stand for freedom\\"), but because of what we do -- because of specific aspects of U.S. foreign policy.<br /><br /> 4) The doctrine that informs OBL/Al Qaeda is that of DEFENSIVE JIHAD -- they see the Muslim world under attack by the U.S., and call upon scripture to support defensive military action by all faithful members of the \\"umma\\" (the universal body of Islam).<br /><br /> 5) OBL has repeatedly stated five demands for changes in U.S. foreign policy:  i) end all aid to Israel, ii) withdraw military forces from the Arabian Peninsula and all Muslim territory, iii) end all involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq, iv) end U.S. support for the oppression of Muslims in China, Russia, India and elsewhere, and v) restore Muslim control of the Islamic world's energy resources for the benefit of Muslims.  A sixth point is to replace U.S.-backed regimes in the Muslim world with Islamic regimes, but that is really a demand on the Muslim population.<br /><br /> 6) The war in Afghanistan was a failure from the beginning, because OBL & the other leaders were allowed to escape at the beginning, and because the U.S. is just propping up Karzai in Kabul while the rest of the country is still in the hands of warlords and the Taliban.<br /><br /> 7) The offensive invasion and occupation of Iraq was a huge gift to OBL -- it has just tied down more U.S. forces that otherwise could be fighting Al Qaeda, and it has become potent evidence for OBL's claim that the U.S. is aggressively targeting the Muslim world.<br /><br /> 8) Scheuer concludes that at this point there is no choice but to resolve to fight a relentless war against the Al Qaeda-led insurgency.  However, if the U.S. took action on the list of demands, it could undercut the insurgency dramatically.  Scheuer argues that the U.S. should move to energy sufficiency, stop propping up corrupt regimes like Saudi Arabia, and remove itself as a target of the so far effective-because-largely-true propaganda campaign of the insurgents.  There is no contradiction here, as some readers think.  Changing political policies AND waging a more effective military campaign are both parts of an overall strategy, and only one-dimensional thinkers would imagine that it's an either/or choice.<br /><br /> If Scheuer is largely correct, then what's the problem?  As I see it, the problem is that Scheuer doesn't seem to know nearly as much about counterinsurgency doctrine as he does about Al Qaeda and Afghanistan, which is his area of specialization.  He disparages police work (including the FBI) and calls for greater application of military force (just not in the places the Bush Administration has applied it).  But the problem is, an insurgency can no more be defeated through conventional military means than a terrorist group.  He should know -- Afghanistan itself is striking evidence -- but the record is clear whether you look at Vietnam, or anywhere else.  Insurgents, guerrilla forces, engaged in asymmetrical conflict, are rarely if ever defeated on the battlefield.  This is why Scheuer's use of the Civil War as an analogy makes no sense.  The South was not an insurgency -- Northern generals were fighting an army, and when that army was defeated, so was the South.  So the distinction between terrorism and insurgency, which Scheuer thinks is so crucial, does not lead to the conclusion he comes to at all. Actually, it's worse than that, because if the U.S. was to adopt the sort of scorched-earth scenario he proposes (granted, he says it would only be necessary if we don't change our self-destructive policies), we would provoke that much more determined opposition. The U.S. armed forces, no matter how big and powerful, can't just kill 1.2 billion Muslims.<br /><br /> In fact, the counterinsurgency literature suggests that political legitimacy is the key to victory.  The regime or regimes under attack have to make reforms and address the grievances that are fuelling the insurgency -- then it stops growing and starts to shrink.  Along with that, good intelligence and police work are vital.  Scheuer's call for changing U.S. policy implicitly recognizes this, but he doesn't absorb it fully into his argument, as indicated by his failure to appreciate solid police work.  There is a reason that urban insurgency rarely succeeds -- it is much easier to surveil and capture individuals on urban terrain than in remote jungles and mountains.  Of course the U.S., an invading army with virtually no intelligence sources in the population in Iraq, is maximizing the effectiveness of the Sunni urban insurgency in and around Baghdad.  And whether we should have any confidence in U.S. intelligence inside the territory of our allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, I'll let you judge.<br /><br /> I disagree with Scheuer's call to drill in ANWR as part of becoming energy sufficient.  It's unnecessary, there's not that much oil there -- what we need is an all-out push for renewable energy.  But Mike Scheuer is a conservative, a tough-minded  Catholic conservative.  He is brave to go public with this scathing critique of U.S. policy.  I salute his public service, and I hope that his voice is being heard in policymaking circles.

Here is Bovard in his own words:<br /><br /> \\"George W. Bush came to the presidency promising prosperity, peace and humility.  Instead, Bush has spawned record Federal budget deficits, launched an unnecessary war, and made America the most hated nation in the world\\" (p. 1).<br /><br /> Of course as a libertarian, Bovard doesn't see the Democrats as a viable alternative.  But he's not as mad at them, because he didn't expect anything from them to begin with.  As the title indicates, he took Bush at his word, and feels betrayed.  Here's more of Bovard's own inimitable scorn:<br /><br /> \\"For Bush, the right to rule apparently includes the right to lie.  Bush has never shown a speck of contrition for his false prewar statements.  Instead, he acts like a clumsy magician who assumes his audience is too feebleminded to recognize the elaborate trick that fell into pieces in front of their eyes\\" (p. 5).<br /><br /> I'm not a libertarian, and while I agree with Bovard's harsh critique of the so-called \\"Patriot Act\\" (more like the imminent  fascism act), I don't agree with his minimalist \\"watchman\\" view of government.  But my message to libertarians is -- don't reward Bush's lies with another four years!  Regime change in November!	2004-08-22

The so-called \\"preemptive doctrine\\" is really PREVENTIVE -- Iraq did not pose an imminent threat, so the invasion and occupation was aggressive, not defensive.  It could only be justified as action to prevent a threat sometime in the future -- the \\"Minority Report\\" doctrine.  This is obviously an incredibly dangerous doctrine which can just as easily be used by anyone who wants to attack the U.S.  The open-ended counterinsurgency war has made the U.S. LESS secure, not more secure.  Buchanan draws on the policy of the Founding Fathers of avoiding entangling alliances to bolster his opposition.  He makes the same point as \\"Anonymous\\" (\\"Imperial Hubris\\") in saying that it is childish for Bush to say the Islamic radicals \\"hate our freedom\\" -- obviously they hate our policies of supporting corrupt oil regimes, blindly backing Israel, and stationing troops on sacred Saudi soil, among others.<br /><br /> Buchanan also makes an important point that China, the rising power, has to be central to U.S. policy, as the U.S. is the declining power.  Neither \\"terrorism\\", which is a tactic, not an enemy, nor Islamic fundamentalism, has the capacity to threaten U.S. vital interests in the way an ascendant China will have in the years to come.  As Zbigniew Brzezinski has pointed out (see his \\"The Choice\\" and my review), the Bush/Cheney administration's \\"war on terrorism\\" propaganda is simplistic and hysterical.<br /><br /> Beyond that, Buchanan the socially conservative Catholic tacks on the predictable call for a White Straight Christian Nation, discussing Mexican immigration at some length.  I don't support this in the slightest, but as his main focus is a well-argued, forceful critique of the Bush Doctrine and the invasion of Iraq, I'm only docking Pat one star.  See sociologist Doug Massey's \\"Beyond Smoke and Mirrors\\" for an excellent analysis of our dysfunctional immigration policy vis a vis Mexico and how to fix it.<br /><br /> Pat Buchanan is true to the old conservative position of isolationism, the traditional Republican position from before the so-called \\"Cold War.\\"  I respect him for it, and I wish more Republicans today would adopt such a position instead of the wrong-headed quasi-Wilsonian crusade of the neoconservatives who vainly imagine they can use military force to make the \\"whole world one big American town\\" in the words of the Randy Newman song.icy vis a vis Mexico and how to fix it.   <br /> <br /> Pat Buchanan is true to the old conservative position of isolationism, the traditional Republican position from before the so-called \\"Cold War.\\"  I respect him for it, and I wish more Republicans today would adopt such a position instead of the wrong-headed quasi-Wilsonian crusade of the neoconservatives who vainly imagine they can use military force to make the \\"whole world one big American town\\" in the words of the Randy Newman song.	2004-08-22

I must say, though, that I preferred Negri's writing before he teamed up with Hardt.  His earlier works, including [[ASIN:0745305768 MARX BEYOND MARX]] and [[ASIN:074563513X THE POLITICS OF SUBVERSION]], were more exciting to read than the EMPIRE/MULTITUDE/COMMONWEALTH trilogy with Michael Hardt.<br /><br />A philosophical footnote -- Negri is not part of the German idealist tradition, he is not \\"thinking in German neoplatonism\\" (as another reviewer asserted) and he is most emphatically not a Hegelian dialectician.  His influences include Spinoza (see his [[ASIN:0816636702 THE SAVAGE ANOMALY: The Power of Spinoza's Metaphysics and Politics]]), Machiavelli, of course Marx, and more recently, Foucault.  The Foucault influence began in his joint writing with the late Felix Guattari, and continues in the project with Michael Hardt.<br /><br />Another recommendation, not so much for strategy as an \\"imagination pump\\" (Daniel Dennett's phrase) for activists, is Deleuze & Guattari's [[ASIN:0816614024 A THOUSAND PLATEAUS]].<br /><br />See my reviews of Empire and [[ASIN:0674060288 COMMONWEALTH]] (2009) as well.	2004-08-22

Based on his meticulous research, he concludes that &#34;deception was systematic and carried out purposefully&#34; (p. xii).  The topic, of course, is the propaganda campaign that culminated in the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Prados is now a Research Fellow with the National Security Archive, based at George Washington University.  He has been researching U.S. national security issues since the early 1980s.  One of his more well-known books is &#34;The Presidents' Secret Wars: CIA and Pentagon Covert Operations from WWII Through the Persian Gulf.&#34;  The Archive was created in 1985, and is the single largest user in the U.S. of the FOIA, Freedom of Information Act.  The NSA makes available declassified documentation of U.S. foreign policy and national security policy ([...]<br /><br /> You might think that a book on the topic of the intelligence used to go to war with Iraq would be outdated now that the Senate Intelligence Committee report has been issued ([...]  But if you recall, the Republicans prevented the Committee from releasing any findings about Executive Branch manipulation of the intelligence.  The report, therefore, indicted the CIA for its faulty intelligence about Iraq's &#34;weapons of mass destruction,&#34; but did not make any charges about the Bush Administration.  That is where HOODWINKED is still VERY relevant.  Because what the book consists of is a careful, line by line analysis of the key pieces of intelligence available to the Administration and a comparison of those documents to the public statements of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice and Powell.  Prados reaches the following conclusion:<br /><br /> &#34;What the intelligence record shows, however, is that contrary to the reports it put out, what the Bush Administration knew indicated that Iraqi weapons programs were either nascent, moribund, or non-existent -- exactly the opposite of the President's repeated message to Americans.  This book is an attempt to compile and share with the American public for the first time the actual intelligence available to the Bush Administration as it made its case for war.  It then aims to show how this information was consistently distorted, manipulated, and ignored, as the president, vice president, secretaries of defense and state, and others, sought to persuade the country that facts about Iraq were other than what the intelligence indicated&#34; (p. xi).<br /><br /> In other words, they were lying through their teeth!  There was no imminent threat -- the war was an offensive war, a preventive war against a threat that did not exist.<br /><br /> HOODWINKED includes the entire text of several crucial declassified documents, including the October 2002 CIA White Paper, the October 2002 letter from DCI George Tenet to Senate Intelligence Committe Chair Bob Graham, the December 2002 State Department/CIA Fact Sheet, the May 2003 CIA/DIA paper on biological warware production plants, and the June 2003 Pentagon press briefing.  Prados meticulously compares the information presented in these documents to Administration statements and documents the manipulations and distortions -- the lies.  He focuses on four issues -- 1) the Iraqi nuclear program, 2) unmanned aerial vehicles, 3) uranium from Niger, and 4) Saddam Hussein's supposed links to Al Qaeda and 9/11.<br /><br /> I see it as interesting and suspicious that the Senate's report on Iraq intelligence has been buried by the press as it turned to the more recent release of the 9/11 Commission report.  If the public knew how systematically Cheney & Rumsfeld twisted the intelligence in order to get the outcome they wanted, Bush wouldn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of reelection.<br /><br /> I would like to make a point about our government's propaganda that everyone seems to ignore.  The very term and concept of WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION lumps together two very different things -- nuclear weapons on the one hand, and chemical & biological weapons on the other.  If the public was clear that there was no way Iraq could have hidden a nuclear weapons program with the inspections regime in place, which is what all informed analysts knew, then the perceived threat would have been very different.  The &#34;mass destruction capability&#34; of chemical & biological weapons is simply nowhere near as great as that of nuclear weapons.  So even if there were stockpiles of chemical weapons, as most analysts suspected, this was not something to be terribly afraid of.  How would Iraq deliver large amounts of chemical weapons, or even a primitive atomic bomb, to the U.S.?  When you actually think about it, the prospect is ludicrous, but most people were easily scared by the idea of WMD as an umbrella category, not knowing exactly what was in it or how dangerous it was.  Never mind that the U.S. government has plenty of WMD, including big anti-personnel bombs that are not ordinarily considered to be WMD at all.<br /><br /> There is a ton of junk information in the world these days, thanks to the internet.

This is not just a book about oil, it covers energy as a whole.  You can quibble with this or that detail (and I will), but this is an excellent introduction, the best single book on energy now available for ordinary citizens.<br /><br /> Roberts synthesizes the information he gathers superbly.  The viewpoint he conveys is more optimistic than Heinberg's excellent [[ASIN:0865715297 The Party's Over]] (see my review) but more urgent and pessimistic than Economist reporter Vaitheeswaran's [[ASIN:0374529701 Power to the People]] (see my review).  Roberts has no utopian libertarian illusions about business, but realizes that business is inevitably going to be part of the solutions that emerge, and so he gives careful thought to the role of corporations and industries.<br /><br /> Roberts does not explain how oil geologists use Hubbert's Curve to estimate oil reserves, and this is a weakness compared to Heinberg, Goodstein ([[ASIN:0393326470 Out of Gas]] -- see my review), or the oil geologists themselves, Deffeyes ([[ASIN:0691141193 Hubbert's Peak]]) or Campbell ([[ASIN:0906522110 The Coming Oil Crisis]]).  But he doesn't base his analysis on the over-optimistic estimates of the U.S.G.S. or Exxon Mobil, so this is not a major shortcoming.  A bigger problem is that he doesn't mention or apply EROEI analysis (energy return on energy invested).  If he did, he might be more pessimistic, and for this crucial physics application, Heinberg and Goodstein are quite valuable.<br /><br /> Based on everything he learned in his reporting, Roberts concludes THE END OF OIL with recommendations for U.S. energy policy.  Here are his three major proposals:<br /><br /> 1) The government should move immediately and aggressively to boost natural gas supplies.  Gas will only serve as a bridging fuel, and might last two or three decades.<br /><br /> 2) The government should implement a \\"carbon penalty,\\" not in the form of a carbon tax, but rather a carbon trading system, a cap-and-trade regime.  He suggests a delayed start and low starting costs that would rise over time, giving industry a clear timeline so it can plan to make the needed transition to non-carbon energy sources.  Along with the carbon penalty, a well-funded R&D program would be needed to develop coal gasification and carbon sequestration.  Roberts sees this as politically necessary in order to coopt the powerful coal industry, which could otherwise block the needed changes.<br /><br />  3) Finally, the government needs to launch an all-out drive to reduce Americans' high consumption of oil and energy.  Raising auto fuel efficiency is the obvious place to start, and does not have to be based on radical new designs, at least not at first.  The details of Roberts's proposal takes into account the fierce resistance of the automobile industry, and is based on incentives, just as with the coal industry.<br /><br /> All of these steps are just part of a bridging strategy to a renewable energy economy.  Roberts doesn't do justice to all of these possibilities, but presents fascinating glimpses into research on hydrogen, fuel cells, and solar energy, particularly the advances in solar that have been made in Germany.<br /><br /> Fossil fuels are on the way out, whether we like it or not -- they are not renewable, and so once extracted in a frighteningly short few years, that's it.  For more on renewable energy, including solar, wind and biomass fuels, see Hermann Scheer's [[ASIN:1844070751 The Solar Economy: Renewable Energy for a Sustainable Global Future]] (see my review).<br /><br />A deliberate, proactive clean/renewable energy revolution is not taking place on schedule, and the likelihood grows greater with every passing year that social collapse will take place first, with the energy transition following of necessity.

US	52386663	RE45INIB7MGS4	0385506724	283863984	A Pretext for War: 9/11, Iraq, and the Abuse of America's Intelligence Agencies	Books	5	33	38	N	N	INDICTED:  the Bush Gang, the Neocons, the CIA and NSA	Bamford's \\"A Pretext for War\\" is a solid indictment of the Bush Administration's lies.  I find it hard to imagine that anyone who actually reads it would vote for Bush this November.<br /><br /> The title of the book is somewhat misleading in that the longest section is not on Iraq, but rather on 9/11 and the failure of the intelligence agencies.  There is not a lot new here for anyone who's been paying attention, and especially with the official investigation now reaching a conclusion, but it's still invaluable documentation.  Bamford's coverage of the CIA's \\"Alec Station,\\" which focused exclusively on Osama bin Laden (UBL) after the Kenya bombing of 1998, is shorter than Coll's in \\"Ghost Wars\\" (see my review), and is more critical.  Bamford seems to side with the FBI against the CIA, criticizing the UBL unit for focusing on paramilitary covert operations, none of which came to fruition, and not systematically gathering intelligence.  This led directly to 9/11 when the CIA failed to notify the FBI when some of the future 9/11 operatives entered the U.S.  Another group of 9/11 operatives lived just miles from the NSA HQ in Laurel, Maryland and used internet chat groups in Kinko's to communicate with Atta, the 9/11 plot leader!<br /><br /> This leads to Bamford's indictment of the intellligence agencies:<br /><br /> 1) The NSA is no longer effective with the rise of the internet, the widespread use of encryption, and the rise of transnational networks instead of centralized governments as the enemies.<br /><br /> 2) The CIA is no longer effective, partly because it was shaped by fighting the USSR, and has not adapted to the new threat environment, but mainly because it has no HUMINT -- human intelligence.  Bamford makes the point that John Walker Lindh managed to join Al Qaeda, but the CIA has had absolutely noone inside it or any other Islamic terrorist groups.<br /><br /> Pages 283-381, the chapter called \\"War Room\\", is the most important part of the book, the part focusing on the systematic abuse of intelligence that created the pretext for the invasion and occupation of Iraq.  This story too has been told before (notably in \\"The Lie Factory\\" in Mother Jones), but is conveyed here at length in an accessible form.  As Richard Clarke emphasized, Rumsfeld, Cheney & the Bush NSC focused on Iraq immediately after 9/11, despite the lack of evidence.  As Rumsfeld said (in transcribed meeting notes):  \\"get best info fast; judge whether good enough to hit S.H. at same time. Not only UBL.  Go massive.  Sweep it all up.  Things related, and not.\\"<br /><br />Then unfolds the story, grounds for impeachment, of the creation of the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon, manufacturing bogus intelligence, much of it from Chalabi & the INC, to do an end run around the CIA & State Department.  Douglas Feith, David Wurmser & Abram Shulsky were the operatives who ran this op, reporting to Wolfowitz & Rumsfeld at the DOD, Libby & Cheney in the White House, and Perle's neocon advisory group.  This led to the creation of the WHIG (White House Iraq Group) in August 2002 which led the selling of a war on Iraq to the American people and the world.  Bamford dissects and exposes every detail of the lies, from Niger uranium to aluminum tubes, etc, etc, and also reveals an interesting detail most Americans don't know -- there was a parallel disinformation effort in Israel, and in March of 2004 there was a Knesset investigation which found that as in the U.S., the pretext for the war on Iraq, WMD, was all based on speculation, and not on facts.<br /><br /> The final part of the book turns again to the failings of the CIA and NSA.  The CIA under Tenet caved to political pressure and failed to oppose the OSP/neocon lies.  The NSA shamelessly spied on Blix, the U.N. and U.S. allies in order to gain intel to sway their U.N. votes.<br /><br /> An important fact is noted more than once by Bamford, a fact that I doubt many Americans are aware of -- the CIA onlycontrols 15% of the \\"U.S. Intelligence Community.\\"  The DOD controls the other 85%, including the NSA (National Security Agency, charge of computer SIGINT), the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office, in charge of spy satellites) and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency).  So if intelligence is going to be reformed, and heads are going to roll, it's not enough to replace Tenet, responsible for 15% of the problem -- Rumsfeld's 85% responsibility head should roll too.<br /><br /> Regime change this November!controls 15% of the \\"U.S. Intelligence Community.\\"  The DOD controls the other 85%, including the NSA (National Security Agency, charge of computer SIGINT), the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office, in charge of spy satellites) and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency).

Finally, the truth is revealed as we hear directly from Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld that America's primary objective is to secure control of the vast oil deposits of the Middle East and Central Asia.  (Of course this has been obvious all along, but it's good to hear it directly.)<br /><br />We are told that the worst thing to happen in recent memory was not 9/11, but the collapse of the Soviet Union -- how will the U.S. justify its global Empire without a big, bad enemy?  9/11 provided the solution to this problem, and now we have Islam!  Islam Equals Terrorism is our new Crusade Against Evil.  On the basis of this Convenient Demon we can invade and occupy everything between the Mediterranean and India!  With the most clever Big Lie since Goebbels, we will carry out this power grab under the banner of Freedom and Liberty for All.

One of the most significant things about this book is its publisher, the U.S. Naval Institute Press -- apparently questioning the intelligence of particular military doctrines or wars is not anti-military or anti-patriotic.<br /><br /> Record has been a military analyst for many years, and the current analysis is a scathing critique of both the Bush Administration's military doctrine and the war on Iraq that flowed from that doctrine.  Record forcefully and persuasively argues that the \\"Bush Doctrine\\" is totally open-ended and vague -- if the U.S. is really committed to a \\"war on terrorism\\" with no limits, then we are in big trouble.  Record's position is that the U.S. should have \\"bounded\\" its objective and focused on Al-Qaeda.  Launching the invasion and occupation of Iraq, which had no connection to either 9/11 or Al-Qaeda, has had several negative effects for U.S. national security, including:  1) it has stretched U.S. forces thin and diminished the forces available to fight Al-Qaeda or other serious threats (and Iraq posed no serious threat to the U.S. as the regime was contained), 2) it has outraged millions, leading to an increase in recruits to \\"Al-Qaeda-ism,\\" 3) it has created chaos in Iraq and a prime area of operation for \\"Al-Qaeda-ism\\", and 4) it has damaged U.S. alliances that are critical to the long-term success of the appropriately limited \\"war on terrorism,\\" in other words the police/military effort against \\"Al-Qaeda-ism.\\"<br /><br /> Citizens of this country need to stop thinking in partisan terms and begin to think critically about U.S. strategy on its merits.  DARK VICTORY is not part of a \\"liberal, Bush-bashing agenda.\\"  It does not include ad hominem attacks on individuals, but rather focuses on the dangerous consequences of current U.S. strategy.  You don't have to agree with me that Bush has committed impeachable offenses in lying about the evidence and reasons for war (no WMD!) and leading us into an unnecessary war to see the need to change course.  We owe it to the brave men and women sacrificing their lives for us right now to make sure their efforts are not in vain.<br /><br /> You can find the study that led to this book, called \\"Bounding the Global War on Terrorism,\\" on the website of the U.S. Army War College.course.

This is just not done.  Talk of Great Powers, or &#34;The American Project&#34; is one thing, but we don't have an Empire, for goodness sake!  Never mind that Rumsfeld ordered a study of the Roman Empire not too long ago in search of useful guidance for an Empire that makes the Roman one look like kid's stuff, critics like Chomsky who talk about the Empire are persona non grata.<br /><br />  Ferguson, however, is not a critic.  He thinks the U.S. Empire could be a swell thing if it would just be more like the British Empire of the 19th Century.  He has an absolutely good point -- if what the U.S. wants to do is be a maximally effective Empire, it needs to develop the capacity for colonial administration necessary to follow through with when it invades, overthrows governments, and occupies Afghanistan, Iraq, and the next countries on the neoconservatives' list.  The U.S. needs to take its imperial responsibility seriously, stiff upper lip and all that.  We should take pride in our civilizing role vis a vis the barbarian parts of the world, and it is nice to make all those profits as well. I'm sure Ferguson is right that the U.S. Empire will last longer if we don't try to run it on the cheap.<br /><br /> Ferguson considers Americans naive not to understand our imperial role, but clearly he is the one who is naive.  A large percentage of Americans are quite happy thinking the U.S. is nothing but a victim and that we do nothing but good in our endless series of overseas military operations, most never called wars outright.  They are quite happy to carry out bombing runs that kill lots of &#34;bad guys,&#34; come home leaving the place in ruins, and then they love to complain bitterly about the mystery of why &#34;everybody hates us.&#34;  Peacekeeping and nation-building is for Europeans and other wimps.  The American way of war involves massive firepower, destroying the village in order to save it.  We're the Oil Police now, and nothing is going to stand in the way of Our Precious Oil, certainly not some British academic who says we should pay higher taxes for colonial administration.

That went on the rocks over the Vietnam War, and so the CFR now represents the moderate center against the right-wing, represented by the American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation and others.  The Clinton Administration was staffed from top to bottom with CFR-affiliated personnel, and the State Department continues to be CFR-friendly even under the Bush Administration.<br /><br /> So much for background.  Not to mince words, Mead strikes out in this attempt to elucidate an \\"American grand strategy\\" for the post-9/11 world.  He basically supports the Cheney/Rumsfeld strategy, and if he had just said so, he could have saved us the 200 pages.  His only disagreement is in the implementation.  Let's go ahead and use our military might to launch preventive war, Mead says in so many words, but we've got to make sure our diplomats can cajole and armtwist successfully to get our \\"allies\\" to go along with us.  This does seem to be basically what the New York Times position amounts to -- certainly it's Thomas Friedman's position -- and it seems to be Kerry's position as well.  I believe it is imperative that we get rid of the Republican right-wing in November, but this book is discouraging, because it is a reminder that U.S. foreign policy is not likely to change much under the Democrats.<br /><br />  The single most half-baked idea in the book is Mead's notion that the U.S.S.R. should now be replaced by the new threat of \\"Arabian fascism\\" in U.S. strategy -- he  characterizes both the Saddam Hussein regime and Al-Qaeda as two types of \\"Arabian fascism.\\"  This is a truly ignorant  assessment, comparable to treating the Soviet Union and China as allies after they had become bitter enemies, fighting a border war and a proxy war in Southeast Asia.  Islamic radicals are organizing against every corrupt dictatorial regime in the Middle East, Central and Southwest Asia, including all of those considered great allies of the U.S., like Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  Al-Qaeda could only operate in Iraq for the first time in the chaos that followed Saddam's overthrow by the U.S.  (See Jeffrey Record's DARK VICTORY for a strategic assessment that concludes that the invasion and occupation of Iraq has made the U.S. less, not more, secure.)<br /><br /> The problem with Machiavellian books like this is that they can't, or don't, come out with the truth.  The truth is that the core strategic issue for the U.S. Empire is control of the world's oil, concentrated in the Arab Middle East, and in  Central Asia.  The U.S. military is the Oil Police.

I am writing this review on the day that George Tenet is testifying before the 9/11 Commission, and Coll's work is directly relevant.<br /><br /> What does GHOST WARS cover?  It gives a brief overview of the massive CIA program to arm the Afghan mujahadin against the Soviets in the 1980s.  There is a tantalizing brief mention of Usama Bin Laden's (UBL) role in this, but do you suspect that what we are told is a partial account?  It ends the day before 9/11.  So what it covers in some detail is the period between the Soviet withdrawal and 9/11, including the period of civil war among warlords, the rise of the Taliban, and UBL estblishing his base there, and the story is told mainly from the point of view of mid-level CIA officials who were responsible for tracking UBL and al Qaeda.  These officers, some only referred to as &#34;Mike&#34; and &#34;Rich&#34; to protect their identities (Mike we now know is Mike Scheuer, who has written IMPERIAL HUBRIS), were clearly consumed by their task and did all in their power to succeed in the years between 1997 and 9/11.  Tenet, Black and other higher-ups are also portrayed as being quite focused on the threat and doing what they could.  Coll's book doesn't provide any startling evidence to suggest a radical change one way or another in the Clinton-Bush transition.<br /><br /> The most interesting part of the book is in the details of surveillance and planned ops -- UBL is watched making a regular circuit with his convoy of SUVs in Afghanistan from his base in Kandahar looping around to the NW and back.  The Pakistani military is monitored for beards -- Islamic fundamentalists are required not to cut their beards, and so this would be an indication of a fundamentalist takeover of the Pakistani military.  A group of UAE sheikhs goes hunting with hawks in Afghanistan, and the CIA group monitoring UBL thinks he is there -- a missile strike is considered, but rejected.<br /><br /> If you find this level of detail interesting, you will enjoy Coll's book.  I found more interesting what was left out.  There is little or no discussion of U.S. strategy in all the profusion of tactical details.  What about oil?  What about Unocal and pipelines to carry oil and natural gas from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan?  What about our questionable alliances with the Saudis and Pakistan?  Coll's reporting offers little by way of answers, and mainly raises more questions.  Plus, frankly, I am suspicious even of what is revealed, given the likelihood that important pieces are still classified.  Overall, perhaps a good read for those thinking on the level of &#34;getting the bad guys,&#34; but of limited value for those of us wondering about what is creating the bad guys, including U.S. strategy, and how to change the conditions that continue to create them.ks he is there -- a missile strike is considered, but rejected.

Yes, that's right -- either we follow this path to a sustainable future, or it is the path not taken as we head into a cycle of civilizational decline, chaos and devastation.  The #1 priority in the U.S. right now is regime change -- the Bush/Cheney Regime is dead-set against renewable energy.  But in the medium term, a rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, centered on solar energy, is humanity's #1 priority.  Scheer has masterfully critiqued the fossil fuel status quo and outlined what needs to be done in this powerful, technically-based, yet compelling manifesto for change.  This is one book on energy that will not put you to sleep!<br /><br /> There is far too much here to summarize, but here are a few critical points:<br /><br /> 1) The conventional wisdom that says solar and other renewables are too expensive are systematically biased by both the current massive subsidies for fossil fuels and what is left out in calculating the cost of fossil fuels.  All it will take to drive down the cost of PV (photovoltaic solar) is ramping up production.  Of course massive investment in R&D is also urgently needed to realize greater efficiency. (Scheer is well-equipped for this analysis -- his Ph.D. is in economics.)<br /><br /> 2) Fossil fuels of necessity require long supply chains, as they do not occur everywhere, and this entails both inefficiency and higher cost.  Solar, wind, biomass and other renewables can be developed locally just about anywhere -- solar energy in principle needs no supply chain at all.  The development of a decentralized renewable energy system globally will, in addition to being environmentally sustainable, ultimately be much cheaper than the current centralized fossil fuel system.<br /><br /> 3) The battle is already on -- Scheer (an SPD Member of Parliament in Germany) and others have successfully passed legislation in Germany and elsewhere mandating that the electricity grid buy power from locally generated renewable sources.  This is a revolutionary reform that has yet to be realized in the U.S., but it is coming, with wind power leading the way.  (Howard Geller's ENERGY REVOLUTION is an excellent guide to policy change in the U.S. -- see my review.)  Do not believe any sweeping claim about the costs and benefits of renewable energy -- increasing numbers of us can benefit starting now, but there will clearly be losers, and that will include the powerful fossil fuel corporations that don't join the process (BP and Shell are already starting to hedge their bets).  It is going to be a fight, a revolution as sweeping as any yet in human existence, comparable only to the shift to agriculture and the shift to industrial manufacturing.<br /><br /> What is needed is a mass movement that works on all levels to bring about the change.  Hermann Scheer's THE SOLAR ECONOMY is the manifesto and guide for this movement.  For the moment, Europe is clearly in the lead.  We in the U.S. need to catch up quickly and start to build a new front inside the U.S. Leviathan -- planetary change will not work if the U.S., the 3rd most populous country and the largest consumer of energy and everything else, does not join the process.<br /><br /> With the Hubbert Peak for oil coming no later than 2020 time is short -- if we want to demonstrate that having evolved such large brains is really an advantage, we have to start using them.

His U.S. scenario has 10 policies:<br /><br /> 1) increase passenger vehicle fuel economy standards,<br /><br /> 2) establish a national system benefits trust fund (a utility surcharge used to promote energy efficiency),<br /><br /> 3) adopt voluntary agreements to reduce industrial energy use,<br /><br /> 4) establish a renewable energy portfolio standard for power generators,<br /><br /> 5) adopt new appliance efficiency standards and stronger building codes,<br /><br /> 6) provide tax incentives for innovative renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies,<br /><br /> 7) expand federal R&D and deployment programs,<br /><br /> 8) remove barriers to combined heat and power systems,<br /><br /> 9) establish renewable or carbon content standards for vehicle fuel, and<br /><br /> 10) strengthen emissions standards on coal-fired plants.<br /><br /> Geller calculates that the impact of these policies would be a $600 billion cost and a $1200 billion savings, for a net savings of $600 billion compared to a baseline scenario of continued promotion of fossil fuels.  He knows that this economic analysis is critical, given that the fossil fuel lobby will try to portray renewable energy as more costly.  Notice that Geller avoids proposing any sort of energy or CO2 emissions tax -- such \\"green taxes\\" are already being used to great effect in Europe, but Geller is experienced and pragmatic enough to know that the U.S., the land of cheap gas, long distances and gas-guzzling SUVs, requires a different approach.<br /><br /> Much more could be said about this excellent book.  But given the political campaign now going on, let me add a word about Democratic political strategy and vision.  The current debate is over who will do a better job of keeping gas prices low.  Kerry is certainly realistic in this, and I hope he wins in November -- with Bush/Cheney and the oil industry in the saddle, renewable energy is going nowhere.  But keeping gas cheap is doing nothing to encourage renewable energy -- it's sending the wrong price signal.  Kerry needs to go on the offensive, making the case that we've got to rapidly wean ourselves from oil for the sake of national security as well as ecological survival.  His policy team should take a look at the bold program of the Apollo Project, which includes major labor unions -- a proposed all-out push for renewable energy comparable to the 1960s race to the moon.  This would create jobs and revitalize the economy while making the environment cleaner and making the U.S. self-sufficient in energy.  Put Bush on the defensive!  Renewable energy needs to become the focus of a mass movement, starting now.<br /><br /> For a truly revolutionary strategy for renewable energy, see [[ASIN:1844070751 THE SOLAR ECONOMY]] by Herman Scheer, a member of the German parliament, the Bundestag, and a Social Democrat (SPD) -- see my review.hat the fossil fuel lobby will try to portray renewable energy as more costly.

There are really two levels to this sordid story -- 1) the alliance between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, based on OIL, and 2) the specific ties between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family, which rules Saudi Arabia and controls its vast oil wealth.  So at the geostrategic level, the alliance and all its problems would still be with us even without the Bushes.  However, in reality, the Bush family is deeply intertwined with the Saudis -- according to Unger, the Saudis are responsible for a significant part of the family's wealth, transferring $1.4 billion to the Bushes in various forms over the years.  Saudi assistance included support for Bush Sr.'s Carlyle Group and Bush Jr.'s Harken Energy (his inside trading of which he was never prosecuted for).<br /><br /> The most dramatic aspect of Unger's book is the documentation of the Bush Administration's facilitation of the evacuation of 140 Saudi nationals from the U.S. immediately following 9/11, including members of the (huge, influential) Bin Laden family, without questioning of any kind.  This operation began between the 12th and the 14th, while U.S. airspace was supposed to be completely closed, and continued until September 20th.<br /><br /> Another amazing revelation is the story of Prince Ahmed, one of the Saudis who got out of the U.S. in the days after 9/11. On March 28, 2002, Abu Zubaydah, a top al-Qaeda operative, was arrested in Pakistan.  He was interrogated using sodium pentathol (truth serum), and named Prince Ahmed as al-Qaeda's link to the Saudi royal family.  Zubaydah said Ahmed knew of 9/11 in advance, and that this knowledge constituted blackmail, a form of control over the Saudis.  Prince Ahmed, a perfectly healthy 43 years old, died suspiciously on July 22, 2002, and two other Saudis named by Zubaydah died by the end of the year.  Zubaydah also claimed that Osama had cut a deal for protection by the Pakistani Air Force Chief, Mushaf Ali Mir, who died in a mysterious plane crash on February 20, 2003.  What might these Saudi and Pakistani ghosts tell us about the real nature of our two \\"allies\\"?  Remember, the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were partners in supporting the mujahadeen fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s -- and Osama Bin Laden's militant career began as part of that 3-way alliance.<br /><br /> In closing, why is it that the Bush Administration was so opposed to an official investigation of 9/11?  Remember, the 9/11 hijackers were mostly Saudis, and a few Egyptians -- no Iraqis or Afghans.

Bush	Books	5	546	612	N	N	High crimes -- grounds for impeachment	\\"Worse Than Watergate\\" is a short but well-written book that focuses on the incredible, paranoid secrecy of the Bush Administration.  The title has two meanings -- 1) the extent of secrecy is worse than the Nixon White House, and 2) the crime of the Bush Administration is worse than the crime of Watergate, which of course led to Nixon's resignation before his imminent impeachment.<br /><br /> The punchline of Dean's book is that the Bush Administration systematically manufactured, manipulated and twisted intelligence, and lied to the American people to justify its war on Iraq.  This is a high crime, an impeachable offense.  It has all been well-documented (see in particular \\"The Lie Factory\\" on the Mother Jones website, about the Pentagon's Office of Special Plans staffed by neoconservatives and reporting directly to Cheney, getting most of their junk intel from Chalabi, the Iraqi con-man in exile), and Dean adds nothing new to the story other than pointing to the logical legal consequence of impeachment.<br /><br /> Most of the book chronicles the amazing extent and nature of secrecy in the Administration's actions, including such things as Cheney's energy panel.  Why is it that the Bush Administration was so reluctant for 9/11 to be investigated?  What are they hiding?  Why was a whole section on the Saudis blacked out of the Congressional investigation report?  The most amazing revelation I found in Dean's book (though it had apparently been reported somewhere) is that the COG was activated after 9/11.  COG (Continuity of Government) was a secret plan for reconstituting the U.S. government in event of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union.  Hundreds of federal employees were relocated to secret bunkers after 9/11, as part of the secret COG plan!  What else is the Bush Administration doing that the public knows nothing about?<br /><br /> Dean nails it right on the head when he points out a massive lie of the 2000 election campaign -- remember Bush saying that the U.S. should be humble, and not intervene militarily around the world? (This was a criticism of Clinton's interventions in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti & Kosovo.)  In reality, the foreign policy team he was assembling -- Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice, Wolfowitz, & Co. -- had put together an aggressive doctrine under Bush Sr. back in 1992 in the form of the infamous Defense Guidance Doctrine, and was proceeding to implement it once again.<br /><br />The preventive war doctrine promulgated in Bush's National Defense Strategy is the revival of the 1992 strategy.  It is a pervasive misunderstanding to refer to this doctrine as PREEMPTIVE -- preemption applies to a threat that already exists, attacking \\"them\\" before \\"they\\" can attack \\"us.\\"  But the Bush Doctrine is clearly PREVENTIVE in nature -- the whole point is to attack and destroy threats BEFORE THEY EXIST.

ZB doesn't say so in so many words, but his new book is quite critical of the Bush Administration's foreign policy.  Brzezinski was Carter's National Security Advisor, but I'm not sure if he is still a Democrat -- in any event, he has always been a hawk on foreign policy.<br /><br /> You can always count on Brzezinski for the use of good old-fashioned realist, geostrategic analysis to produce a coherent strategic vision.  (Personally I reject the U.S. imperial role on principle, but if wishes were horses...  ZB, as a practicing Machiavellian, knows that the Empire is never referred to as an Empire.)  He says the principal challenge to American power over at least the next two decades can only come from within as there is no such power or conceivable combination of powers externally (a sober rejoinder to the more outlandish fears of Terrorist Evil).  The challenge from within could take the form of either A) a repudiation of power, ie a turn to isolationism, or B) the misuse of power.  Repudiation could come from either liberals or conservatives, while the misuse is most likely to come from the unilateralist tendencies of conservatives -- witness the current Bush Administration.<br /><br /> Brzezinski sees the main threat in the world, with the collapse of the old USSR, as \\"turmoil,\\" or as he put it in an earlier book title, \\"chaos.\\"  This turmoil is not evenly distributed throughout the world, but rather concentrated in the Middle East and Central Asia -- ZB calls this region \\"The Global Balkans\\" to indicate its instability and frequency of wars.  For the U.S., the \\"pacification and cooperative organization\\" of the region is the top strategic priority for the next several decades.  He notes in the most fantastic understatement in the book that this area of strategic priority just happens to be where most of the world's oil and natural gas is located! (The U.S. Armed Forces should be renamed The Oil Police.)<br /><br /> Obviously the U.S. cannot accomplish this alone.  Thus allies must be identified, created, and cultivated.  ZB sees Europe as absolutely necessary for this, and unlike Kagan does not dismiss the Europeans' concerns.  In fact he sees that it is the U.S. that must accomodate the Europeans in order to come to a more even-handed approach to finally settling the Israel-Palestine conflict with a workable two-state solution.  Iran is another case where ZB sees an advantage for the U.S. to move toward Europe in forging a joint approach aimed at moderating Iran, which could again play a key role in stabilizing instead of destabilizing the region. ZB sees terrorism and WMD as symptoms, not causes, and that what is needed is a concerted, long-term plan, not a series of bombing runs.<br /><br /> \\"Leadership entails a sense of direction that mobilizes others.\\"  With this, Brzezinski challenges the Bush Administration's arrogance toward the rest of the world.  He sees that the threat of \\"turmoil\\" requires \\"confronting complexity,\\" and says that \\"[t]he political education of a large democracy cannot be pursued by patriotic slogans, fear-mongering, or self-righteous arrogance.\\"  Unfortunately it looks like that's what we've got for another four years, and if all the intelligent analysts are purged from the CIA it will be even worse.

James Moore, author of \\"Bush's Brain\\" (that would be Karl Rove) is back with more hard-hitting reporting.  The theme of the book is that Bush, who had strings pulled to get him into the National Guard to avoid Vietnam and then went AWOL to work on a GOP political campaign, is no war hero.  Moore's book is filled with the stories of the real war heroes, the young men and women who were sent to fight in two wars that should not have been fought -- Vietnam, and Iraq 2003.  The format moves back and forth between chapters exposing the lies, vendettas and trickery of Bush and his team, and chapters profiling the stories of combat veterans.<br /><br /> The opening chapter documents the fact that the Bush administration was committed to a war on Iraq upon entering office.  9/11 was merely the pretext.  They knew full well that they were manufacturing and twisting intel -- what nerve to deny it!  (See the excellent story \\"The Lie Factory\\" on the Office of Special Plans in Mother Jones on the web.)  Hundreds of U.S. troops have died for Bush's lies, Bush who used his family connections to avoid combat himself.  A major contribution of the book is to document Bush being AWOL and the cover-up, including photocopies of many documents and a list of those that are missing.  LTC Bill Burkett of the Texas Army National Guard is one who knows and has paid the price -- he has suffered death threats, shots fired into his house, and the denial of medical treatment that nearly killed him, all because he refused to join the coverup of Bush's AWOL episode in 1972-3.  Another chapter covers the shameful outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame by the Bush administration.  Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife was exposed by right-wing journalist Bob Novak in retaliation for Wilson's exposing the lie that Iraq had purchased uranium from Niger, the infamous \\"16 words\\" inserted into Bush's speech long after it was known to be unfounded.<br /><br /> One of the most shocking stories included here is the scandal of electronic voting.  The use of electronic touch screen systems allows the manipulation of results -- this is documented by Moore, using the research of Bev Harris (see her book \\"Black Box Voting\\") among others.  Diebold Election Systems, one of the leading manufacturers, is associated with the GOP -- CEO Wally O'Dell was a \\"Ranger\\" for Bush in 2000.  Diebold is alleged to have stolen 16,022 votes from Gore in Volusia County, Florida in 2000 with vote tabulation equipment, and also to have stolen the election from Vietnam vet Senator Max Cleland of Georgia in 2002.  It is explained how patches are used to fix malfunctioning machines, and that these patches can easily be used to insert codes that change the results.  In the 2002 election in GA, which used Diebold machines, there was a 25-30% failure rate, which resulted in the application of patches to 1,387 terminals.  This is not a science fiction dystopia, this is the GOP using computers to steal elections today in America.<br /><br /> Bush has manipulated the patriotic sentiments of the American people following 9/11, and is running as a \\"war president.\\"  But he launched an unnecessary war on Iraq, which had no connection to 9/11 and presented no imminent threat from nuclear weapons -- these facts were known all along, as those of us who opposed the war said so time and again as we tried to stop it.

The U.S. Empire is nothing new -- after the initial period of imperialism which involved defeating Spain and seizing her colonies (opposed by Mark Twain and the Anti-Imperialist League), the decisive moment was victory in WWII and the establishment of a planetary network of military bases.  Since then \\"the sun has never set on the American Empire.\\"<br /><br /> Noam Chomsky has been pointing this out for years, of course.  What is quite important and was obscured during the so-called \\"Cold War\\" is that opposition to Empire comes not only from the Left but also the Right.  Johnson is a nationalist, and a reflection of this most interesting phenomenon.  It is big business, multinational corporate capital, that benefits from the Empire, while the sons and daughters of working people do the soldiering for the Legions (the Oil Police).  So all of us, regardless of ideology, who are not wealthy or Thomas Friedman have reason to oppose Empire.<br /><br /> The point is, what to do about it?  For now, the obvious goal is to remove Bush and the neoconservatives.  The Democrats will basically get us back to \\"a kinder Empire\\" and/or \\"a smarter Empire,\\" but realistically that's all we can hope to accomplish for the moment.  Don't let the opportunity pass -- real lives hang in the balance!

Caltech physicist David Goodstein adds his voice to the growing chorus warning that official complacency is steering us like the Titanic straight for a massive iceberg.  Global oil reserves are projected to hit the Hubbert Peak sometime between now (according to some oil geologists) and 2020 (the most optimistic estimates of the U.S. government and industry).  After the peak, we will be on the downslope, and prices will rise as supplies diminish.  Even a surprising discovery of a new 90 billion barrel/year field, the biggest ever found, would only postpone the peak by one year.<br /><br />Goodstein illustrates the consequences -- if there is a 5% gap annually after the peak between growing demand and diminishing supply, then in 10 years the gap will grow to 50%.  In only 10 years after some point in the very near future, in other words, the world will see the available oil reduced by 1/2.  Goodstein points out that the U.S., with 5% of the world's people, consumes 25% of global oil production.  \\"Cheap gasoline is not the solution; it's a big part of the problem,\\" he adds.  This physicist is no polemicist, but it is clear he does not consider economics to be any sort of reliable science.<br /><br />If the market is supposed to magically set the right prices via supply and demand, then how can oil and gas possibly be so cheap when it is so crucially valuable and running out?  Goodstein notes that oil companies do not produce oil.  There are unspoken volumes behind some of his brief comments.  Those volumes can be found in the work of Herman Daly, the ecological economist, who has been pointing out for years that mainstream economics sets itself against the basic laws of physics when it comes to natural resources and the environment, especially the second law of thermodynamics -- entropy.<br /><br /> Given the impending crisis as oil begins to run out, Goodstein says \\"the intent of this small book is to explain the relevant laws of nature.\\"  Small is right -- 122 apparent pages of text are actually only 90 when chapter divisions and graphics are subtracted.  Much of this short text is devoted to introductory lessons in physics (from his many years of Caltech lectures no doubt) on topics including the the measurement of energy, the 1st Law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy), electricity, heat engines, and the 2nd Law of thermodyamics (entropy).<br /><br /> This leaves only some very brief comments and suggestions for what to do about the energy crisis.  Natural gas is non-renewable, and will peak not too long after oil.  The easiest alternative to oil is coal, but of course if we turn back to coal, we will hasten global warming, and as Goodstein notes, increase the likelihood of tipping the climate into a disastrous new steady state more like Venus than what we now enjoy.  Mysteriously, he places some hope in methane hydrate, a potential source of methane, based merely on its existence -- it is currently totally unknown how much might be found under the ocean floors or anywhere else.  He notes that plans for the \\"sequestration\\" of carbon from coal, upon extracting hydrogen, currently have no place to put the carbon, and most such schemes would run the risk of negative EROEI -- more energy invested than energy recovered.<br /><br /> This leads to the fork in the road where I take issue with Goodstein.  Like many physicists, it seems, he continues to promote nuclear (fission) power, saying it is a proven technology and its risks are exaggerated.  He also discusses photovoltaic solar cells -- PVCs -- another proven technology -- but seems half-hearted.  These are the two main alternatives to oil, and either nuclear or solar power will have to be used to generate electricity to produce hydrogen, which can be used in fuel cells to replace gas-fueled internal combustion engines.  Hydrogen is not an energy source, as it does not naturally exist like fossil fuels, but an energy carrier -- according to Goodstein, producing hydrogen with heat engines currently consumes six times as much energy as the resulting hydrogen will produce.<br /><br />If a new generation of nuclear reactors can be shown to be invulnerable to Fukushimas then I might be willing to compromise my opposition to toxic, radioactive nuclear power in order to provide energy in the transition to a solar future, but I do not understand why Goodstein seems to prefer nuclear.  He even advocates breeder reactors, which produce bomb-grade plutonium, as a means to extend the limited supplies of uranium, a non-renewable mineral, and holds out hope for fusion, which it should be clear by now is nothing but a pipe dream.<br /><br /> In short, Goodstein is absolutely right to raise the alarm and push for a crash program for the development of alternative energy.  He is right that \\"market forces\\" are not going to save us, although he does not propose any particular course of action such as the excellent Apollo Alliance plan for public sector R&D and construction.  More questionable (a physics article of faith?) is his advocacy of nuclear power rather than getting behind solar power, which is surely the long-term answer.<br /><br />For a better, more thorough book on the same subject, see Richard Heinberg's [[ASIN:0865715297 THE PARTY'S OVER]] (see my review).  He too, though not a physicist, applies physics in the form of EROEI analysis to all the possible energy sources, and reaches a similar discouraging conclusion.<br /><br />We have got to get our minds focused on this problem, and keep them focused -- if renewable energy does not become the top priority, the test of neomalthusian theory we are subjecting ourselves to will have a gruesome outcome.  Let's not prove that Malthus was right after all.l fuels, but an energy carrier -- according to Goodstein, producing hydrogen with heat engines currently consumes six times as much energy as the resulting hydrogen will produce.<br /><br />If a new generation of nuclear reactors can be shown to be invulnerable to Fukushimas then I might be willing to compromise my opposition to toxic, radioactive nuclear power in order to provide energy in the transition to a solar future, but I do not understand why Goodstein seems to prefer nuclear.

He is right that \\"market forces\\" are not going to save us, although he does not propose any particular course of action such as the excellent Apollo Alliance plan for public sector R&D and construction.  More questionable (a physics article of faith?) is his advocacy of nuclear power rather than getting behind solar power, which is surely the long-term answer.<br /><br />For a better, more thorough book on the same subject, see Richard Heinberg's [[ASIN:0865715297 THE PARTY'S OVER]] (see my review).  He too, though not a physicist, applies physics in the form of EROEI analysis to all the possible energy sources, and reaches a similar discouraging conclusion.<br /><br />We have got to get our minds focused on this problem, and keep them focused -- if renewable energy does not become the top priority, the test of neomalthusian theory we are subjecting ourselves to will have a gruesome outcome.  Let's not prove that Malthus was right after all.	2004-02-14

He fell under the spell of the Gospel of the Free Market in the Thatcherite 1980s, and thus made a transition to conservatism.  When he discovered that Thatcherism/Reaganism wasn't really conservative at all, but rather a dogmatic radicalism, he became an old-school conservative.  He proceeded to reject the Enlightenment tout court, and embraced post-modernist relativism.  Now, he has taken a further step into simple misanthropy.  Gray has written a jeremiad against Christianity, the Enlightenment, science, and any hope of bettering people or the planet we live on.  This is a performative contradiction, of course, because if there is no cause for hope, why write a book?  What's the point?  Fame and money are the only reasons left, one must suppose, and that supposition is perfectly consistent with Gray's line of argument -- all lofty ideals and dreams are illusions.<br /><br /> Despite all that, I enjoyed the book and recommend it.  It's a quick, easy read, quite entertaining, and I'm sure you can find it in the library.  There are many useful citations in the back to more substantial books you might want to read to pursue Gray's points, many made in the form of sound-bite one-liners.  Depending on what you bring to it, you may or may not find it shocking -- STRAW DOGS is mainly based on the growing knowledge from the field variously known as sociobiology or evolutionary psychology or biological anthropology.  Humans are animals, not demigods.  Gray's second main point I think is less appreciated and more important, and that is the evidence that the human species is embarked on a neomalthusian experiment -- overshoot the ecosystem and see what happens.<br /><br /> That's good cause for a jeremiad, and if Gray's disjointed ramblings focus more people's attention on this (\\"death focuses the mind\\") then it is worth something.  Gray is having none of any sort of schemes for improvement, though, let alone salvation.  His presentation is totally negative (we are nothing but \\"exceptionally rapacious primates\\"), which of course is a good strategy for provoking discussion, hostility and sales.  I detect, though, a positive agenda, which Gray only intimates between the lines, and that is the most conservative belief system of all, animism.  If humans dropped their pretense at superiority and stopped all their doomed scheming, accepting their equal status with their fellow animals, and acted with humility and reverence toward their fellow beings, then all might be well.  This seems to be Gray's covert plan for salvation, and it is in fact one I can wholeheartedly endorse.<br /><br /> Gray goes too far in throwing out the Enlightenment.  Rationality does clearly seem to be lacking in most human behavior, but what of it does exist is important to foster, encourage and spread.  (See Daniel Dennett's  [[ASIN:0142003840 FREEDOM EVOLVES]], which makes the same assumptions as Gray, but reaches a very different conclusion.)  Sure it seems like an uphill struggle that we're likely to lose, but I could see that years ago (33 years ago to be precise), and I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't found reasons to try.  Being an intellectual bomb-thrower is fine for someone still young and full of indignation, but there is a planet of sentient beings who expect more of someone like John Gray -- carpe diem!<br /><br />(verified library loan)His presentation is totally negative (we are nothing but \\"exceptionally rapacious primates\\"), which of course is a good strategy for provoking discussion, hostility and sales.

That was the 1970s.  Then oil prices went down, availability seemed assured, and so it was thought the crisis was solved.  But of course oil is non-renewable, so this was just wishful thinking -- whistling in the dark.  Now 9/11 has woken some of us back up to the reality of our situation -- metaphorically hurtling toward a cliff at an accelerating velocity.<br /><br /> The guts of Heinberg's presentation is a summary of the projections of the oil geologists.  Following Hubbert, they use the best information on reserves to estimate the global peak for oil some time in the next few years, probably by 2010.  Some see this as alarmist (see my review of Vaitheeswaran's [[ASIN:0374529701 Power to the People]]), but the mainstream estimate is only a decade further off, at 2020.  The world is going to become an uglier place than it already is after Hubbert's Peak -- prices will go up, and wars for control of oil and gas (ie, Afghanistan, Iraq) will certainly intensify as the demand is still increasing exponentially both in the rich countries and the industrializing countries such as China and India.<br /><br /> So what do we do?  Heinberg does not flinch from a hard-headed examination of the limited options.  He applies a physics analysis of EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) to such possibilities as solar, wind, geothermal, hydrogen, nuclear and others.  His conclusion is that there is currently nothing that is likely to make energy available at nearly the same EROEI as oil and gas once they run out.  A tragic \\"what might have been\\" is his observation that if we had taken concerted action beginning in the 1970s, we might have had time to use the remaining fossul fuels to fuel the building of a renewable solar/hydrogen infrastructure that would have made possible in principle a long, prosperous, ecologically sustainable, civilized planet.  It may well be too late.<br /><br /> This is no reason not to try, though.  In the best-case scenario, there's no collapse and we minimize global warming by shifting to renewable energy.  And better than the worst-case crash scenario is to urgently develop renewable energy, thus providing some cushioning for the crash that will come as we run out of oil.  Reducing the size of a huge neomalthusian catastrophe (measured in millions or hundreds of millions of people dead, and ecosystems and species lost) may not seem like much of a choice, but it may be all we've got.

The good news is that his journalistic account of the energy problem is breezy and easy to read.  The bad news is that it is not so much an objective overview of the topic as it is a religious tract from the Church of the Free Market.  Vaitheeswaran really pulls you into his optimistic account at times, but regularly slips in sarcastic digs at environmentalists and ecologists that remind you of his ideological bias.  What really caused me to question his analysis, though, was his total dismissal of the oil geologists.  I personally put much more stock in the projections of the geologists, following Hubbert, than I do in the economists, who always bring to mind Richard Feynman's skeptical view that economics & other social sciences are all voodoo.<br /><br /> I give this book a favorable review regardless, because it is a good introduction to a particular point of view.  Without being a market dogmatist, I think Vaitheeswaran has sound points to make about the failure of energy deregulation in California, for instance.  He reveals that Britain and Scandinavia (of all places!) have pursued energy deregulation with great success, and argues that it was not deregulation per se that failed, but rather a botched attempt.  The first four chapters address \\"market forces.\\"  Vaitheeswaran makes the case that global warming is real and calls for a shift away from carbon-based fossil fuels in the second three chapters.  Here, he takes a strong position in favor of carbon taxes, which will not endear him to the anti-tax Republicans, and reveals that his view, while pro-market, is more sensible than most acceptable debate in the U.S.  (I do wonder, though, whether he and his editors have read much by Herman Daly and the other ecological economists, who include basic physics in their equations?)<br /><br /> When it comes to the last four chapters on energy technology, Vaitheeswaran has some very interesting things to say, based on his access to the corporate boardrooms.  I am encouraged by the shift of Shell and BP (British Petroleum) toward renewable energy research, and no doubt the U.S. oil companies will reluctantly follow suit.  The possibility of a decentralized power system, with inputs from local fuel cells, is quite astounding, and it carries some weight coming from the Economist.<br /><br /> I am by no means convinced that the \\"magic of the market\\" will bring the world a happy ending to the problem of the finite reserves of oil and natural gas, which are approaching their global Hubbert's Peak.  But if markets and far-sighted corporations can be part of the solution, that's great.

He is a hero, a veritable prophet, in our dark and disastrous times.  The current analysis of course includes Bush and the neoconservative faction, the &#34;pre-emptive doctrine&#34; (actually preventive), the propaganda of the &#34;war on terrorism,&#34; and Iraq -- but the Empire is much bigger than the current Gang, and that is the radical strength of Chomsky's critique.  HEGEMONY OR SURVIVAL is published alongside anti-Bush tomes from Al Franken, Michael Moore, Molly Ivins, Jim Hightower, David Corn, and others.  But if you could read only one of these worthy books, you should read Chomsky.  The focus is on the structure of Empire, rather than the details of the current Emperor.<br /><br /> It is easy to become cynical and complacent given the forces of evil that we are up against.  Personally, I take more inspiration from the fact that people resist than any theoretical insight.  Ordinary people have always resisted Empire.  I participated in a weekly peace vigil from October 2002 through the April 2003 war on Iraq.  Why?  Because I felt I had a moral obligation to take a public stand.

How can we &#34;change the powers that be&#34;?  The audience for the book is the Left.  This requires some explanation, given that if you watch Fox News you are led to believe that the Democratic Party is the Far Left.  Nonsense!  Most Democratic leaders and voters are moderate or liberal.  The Left, which Domhoff prefers to call &#34;egalitarians,&#34; is barely represented by the Democrats.  Those who supported Nader and/or the Greens, those who agree with Noam Chomsky, Michael Moore, Barbara Ehrenreich -- that's the Left.  Much bigger than many people think, but not all &#34;liberals&#34; by any means.  Democratic socialists, or social democrats, which Domhoff reframes as egalitarians -- a group to really scare the Dittoheads and O'Reillyoids.<br /><br />What are egalitarians to do given the current dismal situation?  The event that spurred Domhoff to write it was the 2000 election.  He opens the book with a counterfactual scenario -- what if Nader had run in the Democratic primaries instead of as a Green?  It seems quite likely that Gore might have won, and the Democratic party would also be more progressive.  Now that we know that Bush was no moderate/conservative after all, but rather a right-wing fanatic, this clearly would have been decisively better, if far from perfect.  But Domhoff's whole point is that the Left has to stop making the perfect the enemy of the good if it's going to start winning.  The unfortunate reality is that until the electoral rules are changed, a third party has a good chance of being nothing more than a spoiler, as the Greens were in 2000.  If the Left doesn't wise up to this, Bush and the Republicans will be the only ones to benefit.  The strategy is an inside/outside strategy, working from within the Democratic party to push it in a progressive direction just as the Christian conservatives have moved the Republicans to the right since Reagan was first elected. Domhoff calls for the formation of Egalitarian Democratic Clubs within the Democratic Party in order to build a permanent organizational infrastructure, rather than just supporting the centrists.  Of course the movements (global justice, anti-sweatshop, living wage, anti-war, feminist, anti-racist, LGBT rights, etc) continue to organize and pressure the Dems from the outside as well.<br /><br />This may sound like nothing new.  It's not, but it is sure timely if the Left is to play a constructive role in 2004!  The bulk of the book is devoted to what Domhoff sees as necessary changes in the Left's agenda, and much of this is aimed at the tiny remaining Marxist left, so it may not be as relevant to many readers.  Domhoff's points include:  1) forget central state planning and focus on equitably regulated markets, 2)promote strategic non-violence -- note to Black Blocs!, 3) make room in the coalition for individuals who are wealthy capitalists -- some are quite progressive!, 4) realize the hierarchical tendency and promote decentralized organization -- note to followers of Big Leaders such as Nader!, 5) drop the blanket opposition to military intervention and support humanitarian intervention -- controversial with many!, 6) drop militant secularism -- many religious activists are very progressive, 7) stop blaming the media and develop an effective  egalitarian movement.<br /><br />Personally, I'm convinced that Domhoff has nailed it.  If the Left rallies around the strategy outlined here, its ratio of success to failure will go up dramatically.

Given the current crisis of the U.S. Leviathan run amok, this book should be required reading for every U.S. citizen.  \\"One World\\" is a concise and powerful statement of ethical problems and principles involved in globalization, based on a series of lectures Singer delivered at Yale, where he teaches. He opens with a damning critique of the influential John Rawls, pointing out that Rawls' principles are not meant to apply to the world, but only within nation-states.  Singer's rejection of this truncated moral myopia is the starting point for his analysis.<br /><br /> There are four topical chapters: \\"One Atmosphere,\\" dealing with global warming and the Kyoto Protocol, \\"One Economy,\\" dealing with the World Trade Organization, \\"One Law,\\" dealing with international law and including the issue of humanitarian military intervention, and \\"One Community,\\" dealing with world poverty and economic assistance.<br /><br /> Singer is a utilitarian and a consequentialist.  His ethical philosophy is simple and clear, and is easily understood by just about anybody. One of the central points of this book is that the U.S. is a rogue nation.  Right-wingers like to accuse critics of U.S. policy of moral relativism, but Singer makes it crystal clear that it is actually the U.S. unilateralists who fail to apply the same moral criteria to the U.S. that they apply to everyone else.  Their position reduces to \\"might makes right.\\"  Of course they would have to resort to a completely different sort of argument if the U.S. was not powerful enough to do whatever it wants and get away with it (for now).<br /><br />  Singer, ever practical, proposes a transitional step toward a federal world government.  This would involve turning the U.N. General Assembly into a World Assembly of democratically elected delegations for every country, proportional to their population.  The catch, during the transition, would be that if a country did not allow the U.N. to conduct free and open elections to the Assembly, then that country would only be allowed 1 representative.  Most people today consider world government to be either a bad idea, or utopian, if not both.  It seems clear to me that many things in the world today would have seemed utopian not so long ago, and that world government will seem like common sense in the future, if we manage to pass through the Scylla and Charybdis of nuclear war and environmental crisis.mbly, then that country would only be allowed 1 representative.

Yes, it's a paper tiger, a giant with feet of clay, a Potempkin Village, or my favorite metaphor -- the thundering Wizard of Oz, which is really a little man behind a curtain.<br /><br />With Keen's book in hand, any professor ought to be able to effectively challenge the ruling TINA orthodoxy that \\"there is no alternative\\" to The Market.  The supposedly iron laws of supply and demand are not iron after all, there is no One Perfect Equilibrium, so it's back to the political economy that prevailed prior to the \\"marginal revolution\\" -- politics matters, institutions matter, and the Masters of the World are nothing but Naked Emperors.  Keen offers a section on alternatives, and he favors post-keynesian theory, but is fair to other approaches.<br /><br />As Keen warns, this is not easy reading, and I can't imagine assigning it to undergraduates.

Schoenberg pioneered \\"atonal\\" music in the years right around 1910 parallel to Kandinsky's pioneering abstract painting, and in fact the two were friends and collaborators.<br /><br />Here is an amazing quote from Schoenberg:<br /><br /> \\"It has never been the purpose and effect of new art to suppress the old, its predecessor, certainly not to destroy it.  ...  The appearance of the new can far better be compared with the flowering of a tree:  it is the natural growth of the tree of life.

Take heart, progressives, underlying trends do not favor Bush and the Republicans!  That is the optimistic message of this thoughtful piece of political analysis.  Of course Bush was not elected by a majority of the electorate  Judis & Teixeira focus on demographics -- categories of voters that favor Democrats are growing, and if Democrats are smart, they can count on a strong and growing electoral majority in years ahead.<br /><br />At the largest level, the argument is that \\"political realignment\\" is about to occur.  The Republican Progressives achieved realignment in 1900 with the defeat of the Populist agrarian movement.  Democrats came out on top in the FDR realignment.  Republicans achieved another realignment with Reagan.  (This is the argument, though it makes me wonder how scientific the concept of political realignment is.)  Clinton is seen as transitional, along with Bush, and a true realignment in favor of the Democrats is predicted some time in the next decade, if not in 2004 then in 2008.  Why?  Basically the growth of a post-industrial information economy and the gender equality and cultural liberalism that comes with it.  Just as the seemingly strong Populist movement was the expression of the shrinking population of farmers, the current social conservative movement is strongest in rural areas and small towns and cities, the \\"Red\\" part of the map, which is losing population to the big information-economy \\"ideopolises\\" of the Blue, Democratic, parts of the country.  Working women, minorities, and professionals are all growing as a proportion of the population, and will continue to favor Democrats at the polls.<br /><br />That is the guts of Judis & Teixera's argument, and they back it up with meticulous state-by-state analysis of demography and voting trends.  They advocate \\"progressive centrism,\\" basically systematizing Clinton's \\"triangulation\\" which won him a smashing victory in 1996.  This is the one disheartening aspect of the book.  Just looking at the numbers, it seems the Democrats can win if they confidently rally around a centrist position, similar to what Blair has done with \\"New Labor\\" in the U.K.  Democratic centrism is preferable to Republican centrism on critical issues such as Supreme Court appointments, protection of the environment, and a Fair Deal for the poor -- a \\"hand up, not a hand out\\" as a labor movement slogan puts it.  But I wonder if the activists of the Democratic base can get enthusiastic enough about these differences to turn out for the candidates?  In other words, further thinking is going to be required in order to develop a powerful program and slogans to motivate the real people who are just statistics in this structural analysis.  I think Judis, Teixeira, and anyone else who shares their goal needs to carefully study George Lakoff's [[ASIN:0226467716 MORAL POLITICS]].  According to Lakoff, Republican conservatives tend to be more clear and emphatic on their values than Democratic liberals.

But I wonder if the activists of the Democratic base can get enthusiastic enough about these differences to turn out for the candidates?  In other words, further thinking is going to be required in order to develop a powerful program and slogans to motivate the real people who are just statistics in this structural analysis.  I think Judis, Teixeira, and anyone else who shares their goal needs to carefully study George Lakoff's [[ASIN:0226467716 MORAL POLITICS]].  According to Lakoff, Republican conservatives tend to be more clear and emphatic on their values than Democratic liberals.

This book should be required reading for every opponent of evolutionary theory of both the right and the left, including most of my colleagues in sociology.  While not as compelling as many other more focused books on the topic, and adding nothing new, it is an up-to-date survey for anyone just catching up to the field.  Pinker's central argument is correct, I believe, though there are plenty of particulars to disagree with.  This is a book for a general audience, and is not a tightly presented piece of scientific research.<br /><br />Pinker reinforces one more time that while \\"racial\\" differences are mainly imaginary, there are indeed significant differences between the sexes.  Of course this is no reason for paying women less for the same job, but it does contradict much feminist ideology. The chapter on politics is excellent -- Pinker echoes Singer's recent book \\"A Darwinian Left\\" by advocating a Tragic view of human nature that limits the possibilites for remaking society.  Fear not, even if everyone understood human nature in evolutionary terms, there would still be plenty of room for argument, but perhaps the discussion would be more intelligent and the spectrum of possibility would certainly be narrowed.  A strength of the book is to make clear that conservative, let alone fascist, politics are not a necessary consequence of applying evolutionary theory to human behavior.<br /><br /> My main criticism is of Pinker's discussion of art.  He is on a rampage against modernism and post-modernism, but does not seem to have the slightest appreciation of anything other than lowest-common-denominator products.  It's one thing to point out why the bell curve is where it is based on our evolved nature, and I agree that there's plenty of art that seems designed only for shock effect and has no deeper or lasting worth.  BUT, it would be a sad, sad day for all of us if artists started working only to please the center of the bell curve!  Those of us who are partial to non-representational art, both music and painting, are not driven by status considerations alone.  I, for one, would not be secretly happier if I was restricted to Top 40 radio, Norman Rockwell, landscape paintings, sit-coms and Harry Potter products.<br /><br /> The evolutionary psychology crowd obviously has more work to do across the board, and more in some areas than others.representational art, both music and painting, are not driven by status considerations alone.

Apparently it was a combination of homesickness, vanity, political naivete, and aesthetic theory.  The Soviet regime promised Prokofiev an exceptional privileged status, which appealed to his vanity -- he was overshadowed by Stravinsky in the West, where he never felt he was properly appreciated.<br /><br />And the turn to \\"social realism,\\" forced on Soviet artists by Stalin, coincided with Prokofiev's voluntary turn away from modernism toward simplicity, melody, and populist narratives.  I enjoy both the early and late Prokofiev, but I can see the point of those who claim that his later works are more accomplished.  While his music is not on the cutting edge, and thus he was never a critics' darling, Prokofiev's music is marvelous.<br /><br /> This is the best single book available at the moment for anyone who wants to know more about one of the greatest early 20th century composers!	2002-10-24

Fay includes the official denunciations by the Stalinist regime, most infamously in 1936 and 1948, and so clearly moves beyond the \\"loyal son of the Communist Party\\" propaganda line, but rejects as unreliable much of the recent testimony of those who knew Shostakovich, including the memoirs called \\"Testimony.\\"  Personally, I am convinced by the mass of testimony that Shostakovich was indeed a passionate dissident, and that his music expressed that \\"to those with ears to hear,\\" in the words he often used.<br /><br /> Take this volume for what it's worth.  For now it is the standard biography, and has no competition in that regard.  It tells the whole story, but leaves us feeling that we are missing the true inner story.  For that story, other sources are clearly invaluable -- the book of reminiscences compiled by Elizabeth Wilson (\\"Shostakovich: A Life Remembered\\"), Solomon Volkov's \\"Testimony,\\" and \\"Shostakovich Reconsidered,\\" which contains much valuable commentary beyond simply defending Volkov's book.<br /><br /> I am listening to Rostropovich conducting Shostakovich's Fifth as I write, and nothing seems more absurd than the notion that the composer was a party apparatchik.  Shostakovich's music expresses deep sorrow and suffering, and his defiant humanism.  The music speaks for itself, but I am confident that Fay's biography will be surpassed by accounts that more fully convey the spiritual significance of Shostakovich's life and music.	2002-10-18
US	52386663	R189LR3EI4WBV5	0805067884	607359357	The Tristan Chord: Wagner and Philosophy	Books	5	7	9	N	Y	Wagner, from leftist revolutionary to world-rejecting mystic	Before picking up this book, I had Wagner pegged as a proto-Nazi.  This was not based on any investigation, I just absorbed it somehow, and took it for granted.  Imagine my surprise, then, to learn that Wagner was a hotheaded anarchist revolutionary as a young man, who stood shoulder to shoulder with Bakunin as a leader of the 1848 uprising in Dresden!<br /><br />This part of Magee's book is just the prelude to his real topic, Wagner's later turn to the philosophy of Schopenhauer, but I enjoyed it tremendously.  Like many before and since, Wagner became disillusioned as he reached middle age.  Whereas he had developed an elaborate philosophical and aesthetic theory about revolutionizing human relations, based on Fuerbach among others, he read Schopenhauer and had an epiphany.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating aspects of this is that he was only partially through composing \\"The Ring\\" -- the libretto was complete, but not the music.  He stopped in the middle of \\"Siegfried,\\" wrote \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" in a Schopenhauerian frenzy, went on to write \\"The Mastersingers,\\" and only then returned to finish the music for \\"Siegfried\\" and then \\"Gotterdammerung.\\"  So the story of the \\"The Ring\\" reflects an anarchist revolutionary vision, far from any proto-Nazi sentiments!  \\"Parsifal,\\" often taken for a Christian work, is not Christian per se, but rather Schopenhauerian -- Wagner used Christian mythic imagery just as he used \\"pagan\\" mythic imagery in The Ring.<br /><br />If you have only the received view of Wagner, prepare for a journey of discovery.  Magee's writing is smooth and easy, and the nearly 400 pages read as if only half that.  My only minor complaint is that Magee proclaims at regular intervals that Wagner is one of history's greatest geniuses, alongside Shakespeare and Mozart.  I have only heard a small sample of Wagner's music, and I am as of yet far from convinced of that, but for the first time I'm ready to give Wagner a fair hearing!	2002-08-27

As a tendency this is hardly controversial, as witnessed by the fierce protests against it that have erupted especially since \\"The Battle of Seattle\\" of late 1999.  What makes this book more futuristic speculation than hard-headed reporting is 1) the authors' elaborated theory of this new world, and 2) their unsubstantiated assertion that it has already arrived.<br /><br /> Before addressing the people who really ought to read EMPIRE, a few words to those who should not:<br /><br /> 1) CONSERVATIVES -- If you think we live in the best of all possible worlds and that the equations of neoclassical economics are actually true (a fallacy of misplaced concreteness), first you should go read Voltaire's [[ASIN:0393960587 Candide]] and meet Dr. Pangloss, and then you should go live for a year in someplace like Afghanistan or India, in poverty and/or under U.S. bombs.  You'll get nothing from this book until you have a radical epiphany.<br /><br /> 2) ARMCHAIR POSTMODERNISTS -- I know you have probably already read this and are on to some newer fad now, but if not, don't bother.  Rereading Deleuze & Guattari's [[ASIN:0816614024 A Thousand Plateaus]] will be much more exciting.  Yeah, H&N use Foucault and \\"biopower,\\" but it doesn't add anything crucial to their argument.<br /><br /> 3) THOSE FEW PEOPLE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT RECENT DEBATES IN MARXISM -- Yes, I know, you're likely to have read it too, to see what the fuss was about.  But if not, it's not the most profound of recent attempts to update Karl.  (Take a look at Moishe Postone's [[ASIN:0521565405 Time, Labor, and Social Domination]].)  If you're interested in Negri, you're better off reading [[ASIN:074563513X The Politics of Subversion]], and watch for his lynchpin argument about the real subsumption of value -- I think he's all wrong, and it reveals his Eurocentric viewpoint.<br /><br /> So who SHOULD read this book?  Young anti-globalization activists and anyone else who is burning with desire not only to understand the world, but to understand it so that they can more effectively CHANGE it, as the Old Moor advocated (in his 11th Thesis on Fuerbach, if you want to look it up).  It's not the gospel, in fact I think it's seriously wrong-headed in many ways, but it is a serious attempt to grapple with what is changing and how, and is intended as a tool for activists.  It is packed with useful information on the history of capitalism, and places assessments of the 20th century in the longer view since its complex origins -- like Marx, H&N see the ongoing dialectical development of capital as progressive, and this partly accounts for the book's positive reception in places like the New York Times.<br /><br /> EMPIRE is relentlessly optimistic in its radical outlook, in the faith that it is \\"the multitude,\\" not the elites, that has the power to reshape the world.  Use it!<br /><br />(verified purchase from a large brick-and-mortar bookstore)br /><br /> So who SHOULD read this book?

Read it! It's quite readable if you have a college-level education -- dry, but utterly logical.  The key to understanding Boyer's analysis is that he uses evolutionary psychological theory, which maintains that the human mind evolved in modular fashion, with a collection of various inference systems.  Boyer does not present any neat, memorable explanation for religious belief -- in fact he carefully dismantles all such theories as the introduction to his book.<br /><br />What he shows is that these beliefs result from the operation of several different inference systems.  Lost?  You really have to follow his exposition to be convinced.  (For background, and detail on inference systems, he refers the reader to Pinker's HOW THE MIND WORKS, and I think I'll take a look at that next.)  If you're familiar with Shermer's HOW WE BELIEVE, which has a great section on the evolution of religion, Boyer argues that Shermer's approach is too simple, and he backs up his position with extensive research findings.<br /><br /> The absolute strength of Boyer's approach is his rigorous, logical application of the scientific method, based on two types of evidence -- 1) the anthropological data on the variety of religious beliefs, and 2) psychological experiments which indicate the mechanisms of belief.  Since neither of these are commonly known, and since neither correspond to the common sense of a typical American (or substitute any other society/culture), the reader is taken around the bend by Boyer into a totally unfamiliar way of thinking.<br /><br />Personally, though, my response, though not quite \\"Aha!\\" was a more drawn out \\"...yes, this makes a lot of sense.\\"  (As a sociologist, I came away mightily impressed with evolutionary psychology as well as the importance of anthropological data.)  After all, religious beliefs are strange and wondrous, and demand nothing less than an extraordinary and complex explanation!g less than an extraordinary and complex explanation!	2002-07-17

The potential reader should know that the better part of the book is expressed in mathematics.  It therefore provides a working basis for an aspiring stochastic music composer, but not what most of the rest of us consider gripping reading.<br /><br />I found the discussion of the use of \\"screens\\" in composition based on Markov chains to be intelligible, but there are pages and pages of equations that I would only read if it would further a goal such as a stochastic composition.  There are, however, several powerful passages in chapters I (\\"Free Stochastic Music\\") and VIII (\\"Towards a Philosophy of Music\\") that are crucial for anyone interested in 20th century music.<br /><br />It would be a great development if Xenakis was to belatedly replace the minimalists as a major force in \\"contemporary classical\\"/\\"new music\\" !!	2002-06-24

This is an excellent series of eleven essays, that moves from the most general considerations to more advanced topics such as naturalism, realism, and model testing, and then to arcane debates with like-minded philosophers of science.<br /><br />Giere only finally lost me with his debate with Van Fraasen -- Van Fraasen's position is \\"constructive empiricism,\\" while Giere prefers \\"constructive realism.\\"  Giere persuaded me, vis a vis Van Fraasen and empiricism, but left me with the impression that this distinctinction is not of great importance.<br /><br /> The gist of Giere's naturalist theory is that there is no unitary, epistemologically privileged science, but rather a process of developing and testing models (plural) that are found to fit reality either well or not so well.  This is quite reasonable, and Giere manages to transcend and make irrelevant many of the positivist/constructionist arguments.<br /><br /> I recently read James Robert Brown's \\"WHO RULES IN SCIENCE?\\", another excellent book on the philosophy of science.  Brown is more traditional, closer to the Hempel/Salmon school.  Brown does not cite Giere, and neither does Giere cite Brown, a great piece of empirical evidence for the problem of fragmentation in academia -- even scholars working on the same problems can be part of different tendencies and be unaware of, or ignore, one another.<br /><br />I would like to see a debate between these two -- I'm convinced that it would be much more fruitful than most of the \\"Science Wars,\\" given that much of the conflict there is generated by ideology, not epistemology, and by people in English departments who lack an understanding of either science or philosophy.	2002-04-28

I actually read this little book (really a long pamphlet) in order to find out.  Bennett's central failure is that he never explains what the moral standard is that we should be clear about.  Bennett wants to go on the offensive.  How terrible, he says, that one response to 9/11 was \\"Yes, but...\\"  Yes, it was horrible, but why did it happen?  Yes, but it's important to examine possible reasons for it -- not to justify it, but to explain it, in order to inform effective action.<br /><br />If some people in the U.S. think some \\"collateral damage\\" among innocent Afghans is justified in response to 9/11, why is it any different if there are those who see the U.S. as having committed crimes and see \\"collateral damage\\" among innocent Americans as justified?  We can either assume that the U.S. has never done anything wrong, or we can critically examine U.S. policy and actions and be prepared to change them.  \\"Take the log out your own eye before you criticize the splinter in someone else's\\" -- quote from a widely read book.  Bennett is critical of what he calls \\"knee-jerk anti-Americanism,\\" but promotes an all-too prevalent \\"knee-jerk pro-Americanism\\" which proclaims by fiat that the U.S. can do no wrong.  I believe we should think critically, not slavishly.<br /><br />Bennett is either naive or ignorant of a major factor in international relations and in U.S. foreign policy -- realpolitik.  Interests drive much of policy rather than morality.  Does the U.S. support Saudi Arabia, for instance, for moral reasons?  No.  The reason is oil, and oil is power.  Realpolitik.  What about Pakistan, a military dictatorship and hotbed of anti-U.S. sentiment?  Ah, but they're our ally, essential for military access to Afghanistan.  \\"Containment\\" of the U.S.S.R. was the rationale for U.S. support for all sorts of repressive regimes and contra armies.  The end was supposed to justify the means.  Realpolitik.  If Bennett would just say \\"we are forced to fight fire with fire\\" or \\"we'll kill more people than them to show we're tough and they won't mess with us\\" he would be more accurate in terms of what U.S. policy really consists of, but of course he'd lose the moral high ground.  To say we are innocent and blameless is, again, either naive or ignorant.  The problem with realpolitik, of course, is that it produces a reaction.  Power and violence breeds power and violence.<br /><br />It is not \\"moral relativism\\" or \\"nihilism\\" (two of Bennett's favorite epithets) to understand these things.  In fact it is U.S. policy that is morally relativistic, as it is driven to a large extent by realpolitik.  Critics of U.S. policy such as Noam Chomsky and myself hold the U.S. to the same moral yardstick as other countries.  It is Bennett who is relativistic in failing to do so.ld just say \\"we are forced to fight fire with fire\\" or \\"we'll kill more people than them to show we're tough and they won't mess with us\\" he would be more accurate in terms of what U.S. policy really consists of, but of course he'd lose the moral high ground.

If you have ever read anything by Brown, you know exactly what to expect -- the inimitable blend of vision, statistics, practical details and policy proposals.  I find it amazing, given his topic, that there are near zero citations to even the most influential of the ecological economists (one reference each to Herman Daly and Robert Costanza).<br /><br />But Brown is a pragmatist, not a theorist, and I hope he can both popularize the approach and impact policy in a way that academics typically don't.  The proposals, such as tax shifting, are not new, but face an uphill battle to implement in the U.S. -- some of these ideas are already in the policy mix in Europe.  &#34;Eco-economy&#34; is the latest installment of the Book that Brown has been writing and re-writing since the late 1970s, and it is as timely as ever.	2002-03-26

Elliott Carter, in my view one of the best composers of the late 20th century, has written fairly extensively over the years about his music.  He was actually employed as a critic for \\"Modern Music\\" in the late Thirties, one source of these essays.<br /><br />Presented here are trenchant analyses of the difficulty of being a composer of advanced works in a commercial society, including the problems of orchestras and rehearsals (\\"the orchestral brontosaur\\"), reflections on American and European music, reminiscences of his studies with Boulanger in Paris, explanations of various compositions including the First and Second string quartets and the Concerto for Orchestra, and fascinating comments on other composers, including of course Charles Ives, along with Stravinsky, Varese, the Second Vienna School, Debussy and Mozart.  Carter expresses the utmost respect for Webern's exquisite miniatures, while making clear his rejection of serialism, which he never adopted.<br /><br /> Elliott Carter enjoys a much higher level of recognition in Europe than in the U.S., where composers of schlocky film scores are vastly more popular (ie, \\"Star Wars\\").  While noticed by only a few today, these writings will play a part in establishing Carter's future reputation as one of the greatest composers of the 20th century -- an American composer whether he was recognized by his contemporaries at home or not.	2002-03-22

Charlie Ives was a visionary, an idealist, and apparently a manic-depressive.  Swafford tells his story in a compulsively readable fashion, and wins you over to the side of the irascible composer.  Ives never made any money from his music, in fact he subsidized it with the fortune he made in the insurance industry.  But he was generous in supporting the work of other sympathetic composers as well, including Henry Cowell.<br /><br />Ives was rare in that he was a genius not only in music, but in business.  Ives made a fortune in developing the modern, mass-market life insurance industry.  He wrote a tremendously influential pamphlet in 1910, \\"The Amount to Carry,\\" which pioneered estate planning.  Ives was an idealist and an altruist even as he became wealthy -- he convinced himself that insurance was socially progressive, and motivated his sales staff with his lofty vision of cooperation.  Later in life, he developed this into a plan for a People's World Union!<br /><br /> Ives' great successes all came together, early in life, following his marriage.  He composed on the side as he built his company, burning the candle at both ends.  Swafford speculates that Ives was literally manic during those heroic years of the Teens, and that he subsequently crashed, enduring more depression than mania for the rest of his life.  Interestingly, the Great War was such a blow to his idealism, he reacted physically, compounding his collapse.  Ives retired very young, but rather than turn to composing, he found that he was unable.<br /><br />The rest of his life was devoted to trying to find an audience for the works of his glory years.  I found the book most interesting here, in situating Ives in relation to the more well-known Modernists of his time -- Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Varese and the others.  The irony is that while Ives' music came about independently, it was \\"popularized,\\" only through association with the European revolutionaries, and so he was widely perceived as an imitator.  The world was only ready for Charlie's music after the ground had been broken!  The story of Cowell, Slonimsky, Carter, Gilman and Bernstein, who championed Ives over many years until he was finally recognized, is fascinating.<br /><br /> This is supremely enjoyable reading.

This little book is a necessary antidote to the wave of blind patriotic propaganda following the 9/11 attack, but I doubt that it will persuade anyone not already in basic agreement with Chomsky.<br /><br /> For those who want to read a more in-depth analysis by one of America's leading dissidents, I recommend &#34;The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism&#34; (1979) and &#34;Deterring Democracy&#34; (1991).  On the Middle East, there is an updated edition of &#34;The Fateful Triangle&#34; about the U.S., Israel and Palestine (originally published in 1983).  The key source on U.S. planning during WWII is &#34;Imperial Brain Trust&#34; by Shoup & Minter (1977), now out of print.  An account by a mainstream historian that corroborates Chomsky on the main outline of the immediate post-WWII period is Leffler's &#34;A Preponderance of Power.&#34;<br /><br />Chomsky continues the honorable tradition of the public intellectual in the spirit of Bertrand Russell.	2002-03-10

Bravo!  However, this collection of essays is too superficial to do justice to any of the topics it addresses.  The most disappointing aspect is that it is mistitled.  Only 7 or so of the 23 essays address the &#34;cultural adversaries&#34; of science.  These are some of the most engaging pieces, on Sokal's hoax, Kuhn's theory, and the Argument By Design for theism, which Weinberg rejects (as do I).  Most of the essays are about particle physics (of course!), theoretical reductionism, and the nature of science more generally.  My favorite, though, is Weinberg's rejection of several utopias, and his own modest proposal, which strikes me as just the sort of thing Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper would say.<br /><br /> Weinberg is a naive realist with an aversion to philosophy, and consequently his arguments often have a blunderbuss quality.  He makes important points, and doesn't seem to realize their significance.  For instance, he emphasizes the continuity between Newtonian physics and quantum physics.  However, he points out that --  1) The Standard Model is just that, a  model, which is known to be wrong, because it does not include gravity.  2) Einstein's theory of gravity, just like Newton's, is an approximation, and should not be treated as sacred.  3) &#34;...[N]one of the laws of physics known today ... are exactly and universally valid.&#34; (150).  Weinberg's attitude is much more dogmatic than these insights seem to justify, quite different from, say, Feynman, another Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, or Popper the philosopher.  I am on Weinberg's side in the Science Wars, but he is not the most subtle and eloquent proponent of Science!<br /><br /> For a better overview of the Science Wars, I recommend WHO RULES IN SCIENCE.  For the philosophy of science, try Salmon's CAUSALITY AND EXPLANATION and anything by Karl Popper.  For a more in-depth summary of particle physics as of 2002, THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE emphasizes string theory, and Gribbin is still good on quantum physics (SCHRODINGER'S CAT and KITTENS).  Feynman's &#34;6 EASY PIECES/6 NOT-SO-EASY PIECES is a great introduction to physics for non-physicists.  And on the science/theology issue, a great book is Raymo's SKEPTICS AND BELIEVERS, which emphasizes the sense of wonder and mystery in science, and avoids both religious and anti-religious dogmatism.<br /><br /> Contrary to what others have said, Weinberg is quite clear both that science cannot determine morality, and that there are metaphysical underpinnings to science -- page 120!summary of particle physics as of 2002, THE ELEGANT UNIVERSE emphasizes string theory, and Gribbin is still good on quantum physics (SCHRODINGER'S CAT and KITTENS).

Sokal was Brown's inspiration! Brown has written 4 previous books in the philosophy of science, but this one is different in that it is pitched to a popular audience rather than philosophers. The first 4 chapters are a very readable introduction to the issues. Included are a summary of the nature of science, a brief history of the philosophy of science, and a ruthless skewering of the &#34;nihilist/postmodern&#34; wing of social constructivism. My only objection here is Brown's peculiar treatment of Popper, who is a hero of mine. Brown takes &#34;science is puzzle-solving&#34; to be an anti-Popperian position, but Popper said again and again that science is problem-solving!<br /><br />The next 3 chapters, 5-7, are the heart of the book. The going gets rougher, but it is well worth the effort to follow the arguments. Brown analyzes three concepts (realism, objectivity and values) which are necessary to understand the various positions. Sorting out the difference between realism and objectivity makes it possible to disentangle much confusion. Brown presents a 2 X 2 table, with both objective and subjective forms of both ontology and epistemology. So, for instance, Kuhn rejects ontological objectivity -- the properties of the world are not real, they are just the result of our paradigms for understanding it. But Kuhn does not reject epistemological objectivity, despite widespread misinterpretation -- he says there are good reasons for choosing one paradigm over another. (Brown and I are not social constructivists in that we maintain that the properties of the world are indeed real!) Brown then tackles the SSK group, centered around Bloor, labeled by Brown the &#34;naturalist wing of social constructionism.&#34; This section makes perfect sense, including Brown's argument that &#34;reasons can be causes,&#34; except for the discussion of Friedman's attempted compromise, which I'll have to read again.<br /><br /> You need not agree with Brown's moral/ideological agenda to benefit from the book. But the opinionated part is that Brown is a left/liberal who thinks science has an important role to play in bringing about progressive change in society -- in a word, change toward greater equality. I share his views entirely, including his arguments regarding national health care -- both the Canadian and the British model are vastly preferable to the American one. The last chapters discuss the issue of &#34;democratization of science&#34; and &#34;science with a social agenda.&#34; I find Brown to be eminently reasonable in sorting out what sorts of democratization would actually be beneficial -- he rejects simplistic notions of direct democracy. The people should rule, says Brown, but &#34;they need to hear more intelligent and informed voices.&#34;<br /><br />Brown concludes by calling for critics of science to focus on the role of money and corporate agendas rather than on epistemology.

Mainly what we have here is just compiling the history of reported sightings and abductions, as well as summaries of leading authors (Vallee, Keel). No analysis of the psychology or mass psychology of purported abductees. If you're a true believer, the book probably won't interest you, and if you're trying to understand the believers, it won't answer your questions.<br /><br /> I know from my own experience that the author hasn't begun to scratch the surface of the current types of UFO beliefs. Her index doesn't even include Pleiades! There are lots of New Age types out there who believe that benevolent aliens, the Pleiadeans, are trying to help humanity evolve to higher consciousness. There are umpteen versions of this idea featuring other star systems. There are hostile as well as helpful aliens. In Sedona, Arizona, the New Age mecca (and elsewhere, I'm sure) you can purchase pamphlets mapping the alien bases underneath the Red Rock country, and describing the aerial warfare between the Good and Bad Aliens over the Arizona skies!<br /><br /> I'm sure that there are people who sincerely believe in UFOs without any of this supernatural apparatus. Simple enough, it's fun to believe in the possibility of exciting things that might exist. Denzler discusses pseudo-science, and that is a different category from the New Age beliefs. But why and how do people believe in Pleiadeans, and create and embellish elaborate mythologies involving extraterrestrials as angels, demons and demigods? How do abduction beliefs spread in a population?<br /><br />I haven't read it, but [[ASIN:0415263247 UFO Religions]], edited by Partridge, looks like it might be in the right ballpark as far as answers to these questions.	2002-03-07

A collection of 26 essays, CAUSALITY AND EXPLANATION represents the state of the art.  Salmon dedicates the book to Carl G. Hempel, who developed the deductive-nomological, or covering law model of scientific explanation.<br /><br />Clearly, then, Salmon is no post-Kuhnian epistemological radical.  There is progress beyond Hempel, but it is not in the social constructionist direction.  Not for Salmon, anyway, and not for me either.  Rather, it points in the direction of probabilistic, stochastic, explanation replacing the vestiges of Laplacian determinism.<br /><br />Many of the essays are quite dense, but the book contains a Key of sorts, in the form of three essays that are grouped as &#34;Concise Overviews.&#34;  Read these first and the rest makes much more sense.  Salmon is an analytical philosopher, and analytical philosophy is a tradition that values clarity of expression.<br /><br /> This book is a marvelous accomplishment.  It has proved quite useful in clarifying my thinking as I try to teach sociology undergraduates the scientific method, particularly on the distinction between deterministic and probabilistic causation. It is truly sad that it is not read by everyone who ever runs into Thomas Kuhn and the postmodern vector that he inspired.	2002-03-07

Popper credits Aristotle with the invention of logic, and for being a great biologist and scholar.  But, \\"Aristotle was the first dogmatist...\\"  \\"...[W]ith Aristotle's theory, that science is...certain knowledge, it may be said that the great enterprise of Greek critical rationalism came to an end.\\" (5) And so Popper lovingly examines the great Pre-Socratic philosophers, Xenophanes, Heraclitus and Parmenides, as exemplars of critical rationalism, and makes them relevant to the 21st century.<br /><br /> \\"Beyond the Search for Invariants\\" is the centerpiece of this book, an absolutely brilliant 65-page essay tracing the influence of Parmenides on modern science.  You may have heard the quote from Alfred North Whitehead -- \\"The medieval world was an age of faith based on reason, while the modern world is an age of reason based on faith.\\" (Science and the Modern World, 1925)  Popper makes a convincing case that the metaphysical assumption underpinning modern science is much older than Christianity.  Heraclitus said \\"you can never step in the same river twice.\\"  His was a metaphysics of constant flux.<br /><br />Parmenides, on the other hand, logically deduced that the world is a motionless block!  A motionless block universe.  It sounds absurd, but what Popper shows is that this metaphysical assumption has influenced great minds ever since, giving rise to the view that the universe is closed, and entirely deterministic.  Only recently, with Darwin and Einstein, has Laplacean determinism given way to an open, indeterministic universe.  Popper summarizes the essay like this in his 1993 preface -- \\"It tries to show that Heraclitus (everything changes) and Parmenides (nothing changes) have been reconciled and combined in modern science, which looks for Parmenidean invariance within Heraclitean flux.\\" (viii)<br /><br /> You might conclude that Popper is harshly judging Parmenides.  On the contrary, he praises him as a great rationalist -- he simply disagrees with a powerful idea of Parmenides.

This is an incredible book.  While the claim that genes control behaviors (as opposed to phenotypic traits such as skin color) remains largely untested, let alone proven, (an exception is identical twin studies), research is accumulating on universal patterns of human behavior that *seem* to be biologically based.  Burnham and Phelan, an economist and a biologist, have compiled a state-of-the-art summary of this research, and present it in the form of an easy-to-read self-help guide -- How To Tame Your Primal Instincts.<br /><br /> As a sociologist, I should point out that evolutionary psychology does not claim to explain complex social structures.  It's psychology, not sociology, in other words.  Personally I am convinced that the evolutionary theory underpinning this work will prove to be sound -- we are the products of living in small hunting & gathering bands, and as invividuals we exhibit behaviors that were adaptive in that environment.  Macrolevel social structure has obviously changed radically since the advent of agriculture, though, and it is not at all clear that an individual-level, or even a small-group, biological theory can explain those changes.  (Just as a biological organism is more than an aggregation of cells, complex human society is more than an aggregation of individuals.)<br /><br /> \\"Mean Genes\\" makes 2 points emphatically clear, only one of which is \\"politically correct\\" -- 1) Men and women are significantly different, biologically.  For instance, it looks increasingly clear that testosterone is linked with male aggression and violence -- males commit the vast majority of crime in all societies.  The idea that gender differences are totally socially constructed is simply wrong. 2) \\"Race\\" on the other hand is for the most part a mistaken notion, based on superficial physical variation which is not indicative of significant underlying group differences.

Joel Best (a sociologist, past editor of the journal Social Problems) has done a great service by providing the most basic introduction to the topic, indicating how to proceed in trying to make sense of the statistics we encounter every day.  I will use it as a supplemental text for my Sociological Research course in the Fall of 2002, and I'm already using examples in my Sociology 1010 (intro) course.<br /><br /> Best frames the common views of statistics with a 3-part typology -- Naive, Cynical and Critical.  Very similar to the public's reception of mass media news in general it seems to me, Best sees the Naive and Cynical views as only superficially opposite, while in reality more likely to overlap and reinforce one another.  (Many people will say they don't believe what they hear on TV, but if they lack any other sources of information, and don't critically evaluate what they do hear, they are likely to absorb and believe much of it regardless.)  Best's goal is to educate citizens in the capacity to be Critical of statistics, that is, to start them up a learning curve of questioning, analyzing and judging statistics and claims made on the basis of statistics.<br /><br /> How is it, I wonder, that so many first-year college students are seemingly clueless when it comes to statistics?  A basic social statistics course would be far more valuable than much of whatever else it is that is taught in high schools these days!	2002-02-22

He is radically sensible, and has advocated positions that have drawn the wrath of both the left (sociobiology) and right (environmentalism).  \\"The Future of Life\\" is a continuation of Wilson's earlier \\"The Diversity of Life.\\"  It is an eloquent diagnosis of our planetary situation, along with an optimistic vision of the future, and should be required reading.  Here are some quotes to give you the flavor:<br /><br /> \\"We are inside a bottleneck of overpopulation and wasteful consumption.  If the race is won, humanity can emerge in far better condition than when it entered, and with most of the diversity of life still intact.\\" (xxiii)  \\"The choice is clear:  the juggernaut [of technology-based capitalism] will very soon either chew up what remains of the living world, or it will be redirected to save it.\\" (156)  \\"The central problem of the new century ... is to raise the poor to a decent standard of living worldwide while preserving as much of the rest of life as possible.\\" (189)<br /><br /> Wilson's diagnosis is grim, his analysis radical, and yet he is optimistic that these lofty goals can be attained without structural transformations of the social system.  He believes that the combination of democratic governments, capitalist economics, and advanced technology can save the planet.  Of course that is no endorsement of the status quo!  Radical change is necessary, but Wilson is confident that it can take place \\"within the system.\\"  The ace up Wilson's sleeve is the increasingly influential network of non-profit NGOs (non-governmental organizations), groups such as the World Wildlife Fund.<br /><br />The message of \\"The Future of Life\\" is that there is a huge job to be done, but it is doable.

Popper's ideas were used for ideological purposes during the Cold War, and continue to be used today by libertarians and \\"conservatives\\" to advance ideas that Popper rejected.  What Popper means by \\"The Open Society\\" is a society based on reflection and deliberation, not one based on \\"laws of supply and demand.\\"<br /><br /> THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS ENEMIES is one of those books much more often cited than actually read, and upon examination there is much here that is quite surprising.  For instance, though Popper is mainly critical of Marx, who he calls a \\"false prophet,\\" he also says \\"[o]ne cannot do justice to Marx without recognizing his sincerity. His open-mindedness, his sense of facts, his distrust of verbiage, and especially of moralizing verbiage, made him one of the world's most influential fighters against hypocrisy and pharisaism.\\" (82)  He also notes \\"...how justified [Marx] was in his glowing protest against the hell of an unrestrained capitalism...\\" (185)  And Popper devotes an entire chapter to *agreeing* with Marx's anti-psychologism, his sociological insight that \\"social existence determines consciousness.\\" (Chapter 14, \\"The Autonomy of Sociology\\")<br /><br /> It is precisely in reference to the way in which Marx's prophesy of capitalism's demise failed to come true that Popper distinguishes himself as a flexible liberal and not a dogmatic libertarian.  Because, he says, \\"[u]nrestrained capitalism is gone.  Since the day of Marx, democratic interventionism has made immense advances...\\" (187)  The living standards of the working majority were raised through democratic social reforms which included the 8-hour day, recognition of trade unions, women's suffrage, and much more.  What Popper means by \\"the open society\\" is a democratic society in which citizens reflect and participate, not one in which people are subject to any iron external force, whether a dictator, a permanent bureaucracy, or the so-called \\"laws of supply and demand,\\" which has nowadays been dubbed TINA -- There Is No Alternative to The Market, harsh and capricious though it may be.  Popper says there IS an alternative, though we have to think, and fight, to bring it about.  There is no need to submit to an abstraction such as The Free Market -- the very success of the postindustrial democracies is testimony to their success in democratic social engineering.<br /><br /> Popper's main critique of Marx is that he, like Plato, was a historicist who believed in a universal history of humanity.  \\"Historicist\\" is not exactly an everyday epithet -- why did Popper see historicism as dangerous?  According to Popper, there are but multiple histories of various aspects of human life, such as religion, art, and so forth.  He objects to anyone believing they have the key to the future, whether that results in socialist dogmatism, or libertarian dogmatism, or any other form of teleology.  Popper makes this incredibly timely observation about the tendency to treat the history of power politics as universal history -- \\"...[t]his is hardly better than to treat the history of embezzlement or of robbery or of poisoning as the history of mankind.  For the history of power politics is nothing but the history of international crime and mass murder...  This history is taught in schools, and some of the greatest criminals are extolled as its heroes.\\" (270)  Popper closes the book with rousing praise, not for blind patriotism, but for critical debate, rationalism, and pluralism as opposed to \\"monolithic social ends\\" (396).pply and demand,\\" which has nowadays been dubbed TINA -- There Is No Alternative to The Market, harsh and capricious though it may be.

Here are two reasons to read this book --<br /><br /> 1) Learn why George Soros, one of the world's wealthiest men, a billionaire financial speculator, says that dogmatic belief in the so-called \\"free market\\" is every bit as dangerous as a comparably dogmatic belief in Marxism-Leninism (a topic Soros knows something about, given that he grew up under a Marxist-Leninist government in Hungary).<br /><br /> 2) Learn about the philosopher Karl Popper, a beacon of rationality in a tribalistic world. Soros is an intellectual follower of Popper, author of the renowned THE OPEN SOCIETY AND ITS ENEMIES (see my review), and Soros attempts to apply Popper's thinking to the current crisis of global capitalism. Whether he draws the correct conclusion in every case is less the point than the serious thinking involved. Popper is widely misunderstood to be an advocate of the free market. What he is actually in favor of is freedom of thought -- skepticism of any received dogma, including the dogma of the Free Market, to which many now say There Is No Alternative.<br /><br /> Rubbish, says Popper, and so says Soros. A legal, regulatory framework is required. Without the appropriate regulation, the result is the \\"gangster capitalism\\" of Russia, and of Enron. Along with Nobel Prize-winning economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz among others, Soros is absolutely right in his basic point, and is making a contribution to the construction of an appropriate institutional architecture for an increasingly global society.	2002-01-29

Whether you want to live in a future of rampant genetic engineering is another matter entirely, a question of what sort of future.<br /><br />  Postrel, editor of Reason, the libertarian magazine, and a columnist for Forbes (The Capitalist Tool), tries to mask her ideology in the book but it comes through loud and clear.  For instance, she attacks Benjamin Barber (98), who has the temerity to question corporate globalization.  But if you read Barber, you know that he is not against globalization per se, but is FOR democratic decisionmaking, which currently does not exist at the global level.  Barber has his own oversimplistic dichotomy -- \\"jihad versus McWorld\\"...<br /><br />  Postrel confuses herself with her own categories.  Having grouped together everybody that's not a right-thinking dynamist and called them \\"stasists,\\" (notice the similarity to \\"statists,\\" the opposite of libertarian), Postrel says \\"their unity is misleading\\" because they can't agree among themselves (26).  Well of course not!  There is  no \\"stasist\\" movement except the one that Postrel has concocted, and so no one is misled by \\"their unity\\" other than Postrel.  I can say this, though, I am in favor of change!  Good change, of course, not just change for the sake of change.  Notice that Postrel could have named her preferred category \\"progressive\\" as opposed to \\"reactionary,\\" the meaning is nearly identical to her \\"dynamism/stasism\\" labels, but the problem for her is that to be Progressive is associated historically with the reform-oriented Left, not the trickle-down Right!<br /><br />For a much more thoughtful treatment of the changing nature of ideology in the post-Cold War world, see Anthony Giddens' [[ASIN:0804724512 Beyond Left and Right: The Future of Radical Politics]].uch more thoughtful treatment of the changing nature of ideology in the post-Cold War world, see Anthony Giddens' [[ASIN:0804724512 Beyond Left and Right: The Future of Radical Politics]].	2002-01-16

I enjoyed several of these essays tremendously, including &#34;Radical, Conventional Mozart,&#34; and the piece on the problems with performing Carter's &#34;Double Concerto&#34; for piano and harpsichord.<br /><br />The essay &#34;The Irrelevance of Serious Music,&#34; though, is not only brilliant, but should be widely popularized.  The key is that Rosen writes from the perspective of the musician!  He emphasizes that musicians will play music they are inspired by, even if only for one another.  He presents many examples of music and musicians now established in the repertory that were initially rejected as &#34;too difficult.&#34;<br /><br />But he also argues that an attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator will not satisfy the serious listeners either -- they want to be challenged, at least up to a point.  The reductio ad absurdum of commercialism, of course, is to eliminate &#34;classical&#34; music altogether, as the market is too small for a huge corporation to justify.  (Rosen had a recording cancelled by Sony when he wrote a portion of this essay in the NYT criticizing the head of Sony for his obtuse commercialism.)<br /><br />Rosen concludes that &#34;[a] work that ten people love passionately is more important than one that ten thousand do not mind hearing.&#34;  Rosen provides support for my contention that books such as Libbey's &#34;NPR Guide&#34; do the public a disservice by excluding the leaders of the late 20th century avant-garde, including instead works that continue in the Romantic tradition.<br /><br /> In Rosen's essay on Beethoven, he critiques a book by a sociologist.  While I don't disagree with much here, I do think Rosen mainly takes on a strawman version of sociology.  In the introduction he criticizes &#34;[s]ociologists who believe that the history of music can be entirely elucidated by its social functions and the classes that support it without any reference to the music itself...&#34;<br /><br />What I think Rosen misses is that the very process he describes so eloquently, the process of musicians shaping the reception of advanced works, is itself sociological!  Becker's [[ASIN:0520256360 Art Worlds]] is a basic reference here, but the best book elaborating how music acquires meaning is Peter J. Martin's [[ASIN:0719032245 Sounds and Society]].<br /><br />Rosen is a graceful and compelling writer, and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys serious music!<br /><br />(verified library loan);[s]ociologists who believe that the history of music can be entirely elucidated by its social functions and the classes that support it without any reference to the music itself...&#34;  What I think Rosen misses is that the very process he describes so eloquently, the process of musicians shaping the reception of advanced works, is itself sociological!

This is a collection of academic papers from a conference held at the University of Southern California in 1991.  Unfortunately they are mainly of no interest beyond specialists, and the book certainly does not live up to its ambitious and intriguing subtitle.  It might more accurately have been called &#34;Schoenberg and the Transformations of Musicological Hermeneutics.&#34;<br /><br /> The papers are divided into three sections -- Contexts, which looks at how Schoenberg was affected by his social context, Creations, which examines specific aspects of Schoenberg's music, and Connections, which looks at what effect Schoenberg had on the world.  The third section is where &#34;Transformations of 20th Century Culture&#34; might be identified -- how Schoenberg's atonality and serialism, revolutionary or purist or neoclassicist ideas affected modern culture -- but this is totally absent.  Instead we have insular examinations of Schoenberg from a postmodern standpoint.  Disappointing and dull.<br /><br /> The one excellent essay, by Leon Botstein, founding director of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute, is a fascinating look at Schoenberg's position in avant-garde intellectual circles in Vienna.  Botstein describes two rival factions, one centered on Gustav Klimt, and one centered on Karl Kraus.  Schoenberg was active in the Kraus circle, which &#34;believed in art as a profound instrument of ethical and moral transformation,&#34; saw that &#34;modernism needed to be a critique of culture,&#34; and advocated &#34;truth-telling&#34; as opposed to what it saw as the other faction's &#34;facile bohemianism.&#34;<br /><br />  Given Adorno's advocacy of Schoenberg, and given the retreat of much postmodernism into moral relativism and facile bohemianism, a book that truly addressed the effect of Schoenberg and the Second Vienna School on 20th century culture would be well worth reading!<br /><br />(verified library loan)	2001-11-05

I found the most brilliant section to be his critique of John Cage. Cage created music with the aim of \\"quieting the mind, to open it to divine influence.\\" Kahn is the first to articulate what I have felt, that Cage, the zen anarchist, is just as manipulative with this goal as any tonal symphonic architect! As Kahn puts in,<br /><br /> \\"...Cagean silence...has silenced other things, as it dwells at the problematic edge of audibility and attempts to hear the world of sound without hearing aspects of the world in a sound\\" (p. 4) Kahn turns on its head Cage's stated aim of \\"just letting sound be,\\" speaking rather of \\"Cage's dominion of all sound and always sound,\\" a project to turn all sound into music! (p. 197)<br /><br /> Much of the rest of the book, the sections on \\"Water Flows and Flux\\" and \\"Meat Voices,\\" is a wandering chronicle of various avant forms, and Kahn has fun with organic analogies.

US	52386663	R352ASHX1RPNTH	0198742371	587291072	A Philosophy of Mass Art	Books	4	30	32	N	N	Logical, stimulating brief for mass art (ie popular culture)	Carroll is worth reading just for the refreshing contrast he provides to the postmodernism that is endemic in cultural studies.  Carroll applies analytic philosophy (ie, basically logic) to what he calls \\"mass art,\\" and mainly has the same goal as the majority of cultural studies scholars -- he defends \\"mass art\\" as being potentially just as worthy as \\"elite art,\\" both aesthetically and as the topic of analytical inquiry. However, Carroll is emphatically not part of the cultural studies scene -- his arguments have to do with the way \\"mass art\\" is, by design, accessible to ALL people, not just certain favored, oppressed groups.  Carroll's political agenda then, if you take the position that we all have one, would seem to be a liberal humanism of the Enlightenment, which is not a category I consign to the Evil Other of a binary category!<br /><br /> I appreciate Carroll's independence, but his definition of \\"mass art\\" is idiosyncratic and not likely to take the field by storm.  The definition has 3 parts:  1) the art is a multiple instance, 2) produced and distributed by a mass technology, and 3) is designed (with narrative form, symbolism, intended affect and content) to be accessible with minimum effort by the largest number of people.  So Carroll wants to define his \\"mass\\" category both in contrast to pre-industrial popular art that was not mass produced, and to avant-garde art that is not designed to appeal to the \\"mass\\" of people.<br /><br /> This is problematic.  While Carroll argues persuasively against MacDonald, Greenberg, Collingwood, Adorno and Horkheimer in his first chapter defending the potential of mass/popular art, he maintains the distinction between high and low art, which he calls instead \\"avant-garde\\" and \\"mass.\\"  He attacks what he calls the \\"Eliminativist\\" position, which the rest of us know as social constructionism -- boundaries around different cultural fields are socially constructed, and the aesthetic criteria for these boundaries are basically arbitrary other than what has been established by convention.  But  Carroll's binary distinction here simply will not work in terms of empirical application.  The reality of what I think is better considered as a plural, shifting field of \\"popular culture\\" (with \\"popular art\\" as a subset) is that very few artists/works of art are truly \\"massively popular.\\"  In the mass market, most everything is a niche, from the ska-punk Warped Tour to devotees of Beethoven's string quartets.  Robert Christgau, pop music critic for the Village Voice, coined the term \\"semi-pop\\" in 1980 to recognize the splintering of the 60s mass market across the 1970s.  Perhaps Carroll's thinking is skewed by his expertise in popular films, as mine may be by my greater knowledge of popular music -- there is arguably still a larger, more common audience for Hollywood movies than there is for pop music.  But considering popular culture as a whole, I don't find Carroll persuasive.<br /><br /> Carroll calls his definition a \\"theory.\\"  Perhaps, although as a sociologist I define theory as an explanation.  Carroll's definition simply creates a classificatory scheme.  There is an aspect of his definition of \\"mass art\\" that could be developed into a theory, and that is his implication that there is a biological/psychological basis for what art appeals to the broad masses of people.  At the same time, he emphasizes people's use of reason in analyzing mass art, so his doesn't follow through on this idea.  I doubt that it would work.  Here are three examples of why not:<br /><br /> 1) Bruce Springsteen's song \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", which is clearly not a patriotic anthem, based on the lyrics, was treated as one by many male fans holding up jabbing \\"#1\\" fingers and singing along with the chorus during his 1985 tour.<br /><br /> 2) When John Lennon said the Beatles were \\"more popular than Jesus,\\" Beatles albums were burned in communal bonfires across the U.S. Bible Belt.<br /><br /> 3) Techno music substantially replaced rock music as the dominant pop music form in Europe in the 1990s, while in the U.S. techno remains a subculture and rap music has been the form to substantially replace rock.<br /><br /> How can these examples be squared with the idea that \\"mass art\\" taps into universal biological responses in people?  A second point to draw is that there is diversity within a \\"mass\\" audience.  By definition, I would be bold enough to say, the bigger the audience for an artist/work of art, the greater the diversity of views of that art among its audience.  Back to Christgau's \\"semi-pop\\"...<br /><br /> Carroll's book is six chapters long.  The first two chapters are excellent, arguing against the \\"majority tradition\\" that has condemned mass/popular/low art, and against the \\"minority tradition\\" (Benjamin and McLuhan) who have celebrated \\"mass art.\\"  The final three chapters are also excellent, analyzing emotion, morality and ideology in \\"mass art.\\"  The problem lies in Chapter 3, \\"The Nature of Mass Art\\" where Carroll presents his definition.  Despite the problems with the core of Carroll's presentation, the book is well worth reading.  The clarity of Caroll's thinking forces the reader to clarify her own thinking, which is the goal of any good, clear analytic philosophy.<br /><br /> For what I consider to be a more compelling theoretical account, I recommend Peter J. Martin's SOUNDS AND SOCIETY (see my review), which presents a social constructionist theory of music (and art more broadly, by extension) which Carroll would appreciate for its clarity of exposition.  This is not just a case of sociological loyalty, given that Martin critiques the social-structural theory that the meaning of music/art is the simple product of its social context.<br /><br />(verified purchase from a large brick-and-mortar bookstore)ially replaced rock music as the dominant pop music form in Europe in the 1990s, while in the U.S. techno remains a subculture and rap music has been the form to substantially replace rock.<br /><br /> How can these examples be squared with the idea that \\"mass art\\" taps into universal biological responses in people?

That sort of thing doesn't seem to be done anymore.  Our culture today prefers to tear people down, as in the book series \\"Kill Your Idols.\\"<br /><br /> My life was changed by Dylan's music of the '60s, though, and I couldn't resist reading the new books during the year of his 60th birthday.  \\"Down the Highway\\" is a bland, by-the-numbers bio.  It manages to take someone as fascinating as Dylan and make him boring.  I don't read biographies, as a rule, and Sounes' book reminds me why.

Sounes' DOWN THE HIGHWAY is dull, boring and uninformative by comparison.  The copy of BEHIND THE SHADES REVISITED sitting in front of me is 720 pages long, without the long list of interviewees, discography, bibliography and so forth at the back, so I don't know why the site description lists it as five hundred and some.  Where Sounes' book is a by-the-numbers bio, Heylin leaves long quotes intact throughout the book, giving it a rich texture, rather than reducing it to the mush of the omniscient narrator.<br /><br /> The last book I read about Dylan was Scaduto's in 1972.  These books of 2001 no longer make possible the naive hero worship I was so thrillingly involved in back then while in high school.  It's the art that is Great, not the man, an imperfect vessel.  I have come, over time, to find a tragic view of life much more accurate than a heroic one, and that seems to be something that Dylan and I have both learned.  Young idealists beware -- you can safely listen to Dylan's '60s music and read Scaduto if you want to avoid these things -- I wouldn't want to have been old before MY time!<br /><br /> Beyond technique, what really sets Heylin's book apart and makes it compelling (I personally have no interest in a National Enquirer-style expose) is that his life has been changed by Dylan's music, just as mine has.  He therefore seeks the meaning at the intersection of the man and the art.  This is still a worthwhile quest.

Considered a, if not The, \\"Father of Ambient,\\" he is a paragon for the all-black-wearing conceptual art school crowd.  What most interests me as a sociologist is how Eno's reputation came about, when, he admits himself, he is responsible for \\"no breakthroughs\\" (pp. 172-173), and is more important as an influence than someone whose records many people actually listen to.  (For instance, I doubt if too many people in chill rooms at raves listen to Eno -- more likely it's the Orb, or FSOL, or the many others influenced by Terry Riley, Eno and others.)<br /><br />The thing is, I have been around long enough to remember Eno as the androgynous keyboard player for Roxy Music, and so I've seen him move from '70s prog-rock to Father of Ambient.  Nice move!  It seems to me that his position is based on two very different things:  1) fame by association, based on his collaborations and production of Bowie, the Talking Heads and U2, and 2) his late '70s move toward \\"ambient\\" on recordings such as MUSIC FOR AIRPORTS and ON LAND.<br /><br />Two crucial influences on Eno are Satie, who started an anti-romantic movement in music, and Cage, who saw himself as an \\"inventor\\" in the field of music, with no particular musical aptitude.  Eno, likewise, strikes a minimalist posture in opposition to the excess of '70s prog-rock (ie, ELP, Yes), and a cool posture in opposition to the hot, angry punk movement.  Anti-heroic and detached.<br /><br />So it seems to me that Eno has managed to succeed in an unusual way by working in the interstices between genres, and by refusing to be pigeonholed by any tendency.  He has been in the right place at the right time, for instance, attaching himself to the Talking Heads and thus transitioning from the '70s to the '80s in style, and has known the right people.  He keeps moving, keeps experimenting, and maintains tension between multiple positions.<br /><br />For instance, he minimizes emotion compared to much conventional pop, but tries to maintain a \\"seductive\\" prettiness (p. 174) compared to the dry formalism of the avant-garde.  He's avant-garde, but also  a populist!  A fascinating element that Tamm reveals is Eno's technical proficiency, and deliberate use of mechanical \\"glitches\\" to produce unique sounds.<br /><br />Tamm apparently wrote this originally as a Ph.D thesis -- I wonder how many dissertations there are by now on Eno?  At least as edited for DaCapo, it is an excellent work of musical scholarship.  In particular, Tamm does a superb job of using direct quotes from Eno to make his main points.

It serves, among other things, as the best record guide to the post-war avant-garde that I've found, although since '95 it has become somewhat outdated.<br /><br /> Griffiths imbues the story of the serialist avant-garde with high drama.  The hero of his story is Pierre Boulez.  Messiaen is the mentor, and Stockhausen the brother, a source of friendly but intense rivalry.  Schoenberg is the father figure who Boulez \\"kills\\" even as he carries on his tradition, but of course crediting Webern.  The history gives a palpable sense of the excitement of this avant-garde circle, which came together at Darmstadt.  Cage and his zen anarchism presents a radical challenge to the integral serialist Project, and begins to explode it.<br /><br /> This takes us through the 1950s.  The second part of the book is equally good, as the linear sense of progress unravels in the 1960s and '70s and fragmentation sets in.  A fascinating development which Griffiths documents, but does not comment on, is the resurgence of sacred music as the secular avant-garde disintegrates.  The Estonian composer Arvo Part is but one example of this trend, what might be called the reassertion of the pre-modern in the context of the post-modern.  The third section is not as good, and resembles other similar books in being more an encyclopedia of entries on various composers and trends.  There doesn't seem to be much alternative to this for now, but it's interesting to imagine how the present period may be reconstructed in light of future developments...<br /><br /> In his introduction Griffiths laments the loss of a sense of shared criteria for evaluating the diverse music of the moment.  But of course books like this contribute to the construction of those criteria!  Peter J. Martin's SOUNDS AND SOCIETY (see my review) is an excellent analysis of how music evaluation is socially constructed -- there are no objective, inherent qualities, and so something like writing a book or even posting reviews to a website serves to shape the reception of the art.  An interesting topic to pursue would be the divergent paths of Boulez and Stockhausen, with the former becoming an esteemed conductor and not only championing the avant-garde, but also turning back to the once scorned romantic tradition, while Stockhausen followed an increasingly idiosyncratic path and became a revered figure for the 90s electronica movement, a \\"Father of Electronic Music\\"!<br /><br /> MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is indispensable for anyone trying to understand the rich complexities of contemporary composition.  I recommend Morgan's TWENTIETH-CENTURY MUSIC (see my review) for the pre-WWII period, and Gann's AMERICAN MUSIC IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY (see my review) for greater detail on the postwar U.S.structed -- there are no objective, inherent qualities, and so something like writing a book or even posting reviews to a website serves to shape the reception of the art.

This book is unique in covering developments over the past century exclusively in the States, and thus giving more coverage to lesser-known composers.  For instance, I had never heard of Roger Reynolds before reading Gann's book, and he is now one of my favorites.  (For books that place American developments in the context of developments in Europe, I recommend Morgan's [[ASIN:039395272X Twentieth-Century Music]] and Griffiths' [[ASIN:019974050X Modern Music and After]], which begins after World War II.)<br /><br />I used to read Gann's column in the Village Voice back in the late Eighties, but the scene he described sounded too dry and formalistic to pursue.  Now I am finally catching up with contemporary \\"classical\\" music and can better appreciate Gann's contribution.  His last section is on post-minimalist developments he groups together and calls \\"totalism.\\"  Sad to say, this music seems to have a \\"minimal\\" audience outside of small districts in NYC and perhaps the Bay Area, despite its attempt at populism, incorporating rock and intersecting with jazz as well in the so-called Downtown scene (John Zorn, the Knitting Factory, Tzadik Records).<br /><br />Of course avant-garde music will probably always be marginal, and here's to Gann and all those who keep it alive!	2001-05-12

He divides his analysis into 3 logical sections:<br /><br /> Part 1. Beyond Tonality:  From 1900 to World War I<br /><br /> Part 2. Reconstruction and New Systems:  Between the Wars<br /><br /> Part 3. Innovation and Fragmentation:  From WWII to the Present<br /><br /> This allows for some nuance that a simple list of composers often misses.  For instance, Schoenberg's \\"atonal revolution\\" is covered in Part 1, along with the \\"new tonalities\\" of Stravinsky and Bartok.  Part 2 covers the origin of the \\"twelve-tone system,\\" but makes clear that it did not become influential until years later with the \\"serial revolution\\" in France, led by Messiaen and Boulez, in Part 3.<br /><br /> As others have noted, Morgan is not as strong on the more recent period, partly because the book was published in 1991 and thus misses such phenomena as Schnittke's surge of popularity, especially in Russia and Europe, after the collapse of the Soviet regime.<br /><br />I recommend two other books along with Morgan:  1) Gann's [[ASIN:002864655X American Music in the Twentieth Century]], which covers developments in the U.S. in greater detail, thus including for instance one of my favorites, Roger Reynolds, and 2) Griffiths' masterful [[ASIN:019974050X Modern Music and After]], which begins after the Second World War.	2001-05-12

Nyman's 1974 classic is here reprinted sans revisions.  Brilliant!  It captures a moment -- as Nyman concludes his preface, \\"Thank goodness I wrote it when I did.\\"  EM is not a survey of 20th century avant-garde music.  It focuses on one trend, inaugurated by Cage, Wolff, Feldman and Brown in the 1950s, a trend which explicitly attempted to overturn the traditional avant-garde then marching under the banner of total serialism.  Nyman contrasts Wolff to Stockhausen, then a leading serialist:  \\"Stockhausen is speaking of an unwanted situation needing to be remedied by his intervention, Wolff of a situation he is quite happy to accept, leaving sounds to go their own way.\\" (27)  As Cage says in his \\"Silence,\\"<br /><br />\\"Not an attempt to understand...  Just an attention to the activity of sounds.\\"<br /><br /> One of the great strengths of Nyman's short book is his careful attempt to define experimental music before he moves on to discuss the artists and their music.  To summarize and paraphrase, he says experimental composers are excited by creating \\"a process of generating action,\\" involving situations or fields delineated by compositional rules, but leaving them open to the performers. (4)<br /><br /> Experimental music is uncompromisingly radical, and represents an ongoing influence on creative music, but has certainly not become any sort of popular movement.  So for instance, while the early \\"minimalists\\" Young and Riley were arguably part of the experimental tendency, as were Reich's early phase patterns, (and hence are included here by Nyman), the later works of Reich, and especially Glass, are no longer open and experimental.  And while Eno and recent techno/ambient artists have been influenced, their innovations have been more technical than conceptual by comparison.<br /><br /> My recommendation if this sounds intriguing -- check out anything by the English free-improv group AMM, which is nowadays constituted by Eddie Prevost on percussion, Keith Rowe on guitar and electronics, and John Tilbury on piano!<br /><br />(verified library loan)r and electronics, and John Tilbury on piano!<br /><br />(verified library loan)	2001-03-28

I expected serious analysis, and by that criteria would give it 1 star.  If what you're interested in, though, is an eclectic encyclopedia of interesting 20th century musicians, loosely grouped by the theme of \\"ambience,\\" which is never defined, then you might think this is great.  (I can't comment on the fact-checking criticism, but to me it's a secondary point.)  Prendergast moves from \\"high art\\" composers including Debussy and Stockhausen, to \\"minimalism,\\" to rock, broken into categories such as psychedelic, krautrock and synthesizer music, to the '90s techno/house/drum&bass/ambient trend.<br /><br /> However, his definition of \\"ambient\\" involves \\"music being deconstructed\\" by Mahler and Debussy (sounds really \\"postmodern,\\" but what does it mean?), and developments in technology/electronics, along with an \\"interest in pure sound.\\"  He pronounces:  \\"[T]he bleeding heart of electronic progress had by its very nature rendered all recorded music, by definition, Ambient.\\" (4)  Given this sort of cosmic perspective Prendergast could have included all music, and what he does include seems to be more or less \\"cool stuff that I like.\\"  Harsh, I know, but does Bob Dylan's \\"Knocking on Heaven's Door,\\" by any stretch of the conceptual imagination, belong on a list of the Essential 100 Recordings of 20th Century Ambient Music?  If so, our author fails to offer any explanation.  How about Led Zeppelin IV (ie, ZOSO)?  I'm at a loss.<br /><br /> If the book was appropriately titled, I would have much less to criticize.  But when you title a book \\"The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age,\\" you lead the reader to expect some sort of theoretical analysis -- what sort of evolution?  In what direction?  What mechanisms are involved?  But there is \\"no there there\\" if what is happening is just technological progress, and \\"an interest in pure sound\\" may characterize Cage's famous *4'33\\"* (the silent composition), but there is not even an attempt here to argue that it is the direction of 20th century music.  If Prendergast really means to emphasize the use of music as background, where is his discussion of Muzak, and music in advertising?  He doesn't develop his embryonic theme(s), but rather rushes headlong into profiles of musicians, which are strung together with little connecting analysis.<br /><br /> Caveat emptor -- if you're looking for serious analysis, look elsewhere, but if you want a breezy journalistic encyclopedia of non-mainstream music (that is seen as cool by The Wire magazine) you might find this a useful reference work.

I read this collection of Giddins' Village Voice essays a couple of years after it was first published by Oxford in 1985.  The picture of jazz it captures from the early '80s is, for better or worse, not so different from the picture today.  No revolutions, just an ongoing period of recombinations and the uneasy coexistence of various styles.<br /><br /> Giddins is catholic in his enthusiasms, but I was and continue to be more interested in the avant-garde.  In addition to swing and bop players (including Monk, from whom he took his title), here are some of the players he writes about, mainly their recordings, but also some concerts -- Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, Ronald Shannon Jackson, James Blood Ulmer, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Muhal Richard Abrams, James DeJohnette, Andrew Cyrille, James Newton, Anthony Davis, Arthur Blythe, David Murray, Steve Lacy and Roswell Rudd, the William Breuker Kollektief, and Alexander von Schlippenbach's Global Unity Orchestra.<br /><br /> He concludes a review of the \\"Young Lions\\" performance, including the 21-year-old Wynton Marsalis, at the 1982 Kool Jazz Festival in NYC with these prophetic lines:  \\"My intuition tells me that innovation isn't this generation's fate...the neoclassicists have a task no less valuable than innovation:  sustenance. [M]usicians such as Marsalis are needed to restore order, replenish melody, revitalize the beat, loot the tradition for whatever works, and expand the audience.  That way we'll be all the hungrier for the next incursion of genuine avant-gardists...\\" (161)  Of course \\"this generation\\" cannot be reduced to the neoclassical  revivalists, but to the extent that they have dominated the jazz world since the mid-'80s, Giddins had it right \\"on the money,\\" in every sense of the word.<br /><br /> That tendency has now persisted long past the time it was (arguably) making a needed contribution.  Contrary to Marsalis, the living soul of jazz is creative improvisation, not ossified composition!  As of 2005, jazz is still in need of rejuvenation.  Having a jazz museum at the Lincoln Center is fine, but jazz can only be kept alive outside of museums through constant innovation.ing soul of jazz is creative improvisation, not ossified composition!

However, I learned something about the personal and musical history of so-called &#34;minimalism.&#34;  (Potter falls prey to some extent to the problem of reifying an abstraction -- having first grouped some things together into a category, then searching for the true meaning of the category.)  Is there a torch passed, so to speak, from Young to Riley to Reich to Glass?  Glass is the only one to adamantly deny it, but Potter documents the basis for seeing it just that way (including Reich's influence on Glass).<br /><br /> One aspect I am keen to know more about, but which Potter doesn't stress overly much, is the striking confluence of non-Western influences.  Young and Riley are both disciples of the North Indian master singer, Pandit Pran Nath, who died in 1996.  Reich studied both African drumming as well as the gamelan music of Bali.  Glass studied Indian music, after being immersed in serialism.  With the European &#34;classical&#34; tradition at an impasse at the turn of the millennium, it seems only natural that the future would lie in creative fusions and combinations  with other traditions.  (Not a very original idea, I realize, as evidenced by the recent emphasis of the Kronos Quartet among others.)  Minimalism seems by now to be another style that passed into history and critical assessments -- is there an opening there that is being missed?	2001-03-22

The giant new edition has dropped, and it's a beauty, with a cool blue cover and over 1600 two-column pages of reviews.  Some talk as if this book had any competition -- get real!  That would be AMG, and it's online.  This is THE ONE!  A category of gripers seems to be the mainstream bop crowd, who want to stop the clock before 1959, but Cook & Morton simply do not leave out any serious jazz, which of course includes bop.  Yes, they include the avant-garde, but if you don't like it, then don't read those reviews!  Their approach is catholic -- inclusive.  One type of \\"jazz fan\\" definitely won't like this guide, and that is people who think Kenny G plays jazz.  Cook & Morton mince no words in their introduction:<br /><br /> \\"We have decided again to dismiss many records which amount to little more than easy-listening, instrumental or vocal music with only the vaguest of jazz connotations.  The radio format in America known as \\"smooth jazz\\" includes a great deal of this kind of thing.\\"<br /><br /> So it comes down to recommendations for 2 groups, those new to Cook & Morton, and those who already have an earlier edition:<br /><br /> 1) If you haven't yet encountered Cook & Morton, and you either are or are becoming a serious jazz fan, then you must have this book -- it's that simple.  You will be amazed at what you don't know, and will soon learn!<br /><br /> 2) If you already have an earlier edition, it's chancier whether you \\"need\\" the new 5th or not.  My first edition of C&M was the Third (purple, 1996).  The Fourth (orange, 1999) just wasn't the same -- as many others have noted, some sort of update would be just the ticket when you've already been through most of the older releases.  If you keep up with new releases by reading such publications as Down Beat (mainstream), Cadence, Coda, Signal to Noise or The Wire (all of which emphasize the avant-garde), then you are likely to find that the additions to the latest C&M are very patchy compared to what you already know.<br /><br /> One last word for fellow enthusiasts of the avant-garde, who may just discovering it via/despite Ken Burns -- Cook & Morton is a bible of sorts, but here are three more indispensable introductions:  A) \\"Free Jazz\\" by Jost, B) \\"The Freedom Principle\\" by Litweiler, and C) \\"As Serious As Your Life\\" by Wilmer.

That is the question this book sets out to answer.  It is a serious work of sociology, and not light reading, but recommended to anyone who has ever pondered the question.  Martin is clear and logical in his exposition -- no postmodern gibberish here! -- but this is an academic work, not breezy journalism.<br /><br />Martin argues against three widespread views:  1) that music contains some essential meaning, (for instance that major chords produce a happy feeling physiologically), 2) the Cartesian view that music is produced by rationality, (and so Western Classical music reflects the pinnacle of rationality), and 3) that music is simply a reflection of the society in which it was produced.  This third view is a simplistic sociological view, which Martin effectively challenges, along with the two traditional views.<br /><br />What he advances, quite effectively, is a social constructionist view of music.  The meaning of music is the result of the interactions of its producers and those who hear it, within a given social context.  A reasonable view, to be sure, but one made with systematic care, and a thorough critique of various theorists along the way, including Marx, Durkheim and Weber in the introductory section, Cooke, Shepherd, and Adorno, the sole subject of one long chapter.<br /><br />SOUNDS AND SOCIETY is worth reading either for understanding music, or for appreciating the importance of sociology to that understanding, or both. (I am a sociologist by profession, as well as a music lover, so for me it works on both levels!)  This is a definitive work -- Martin could have called it \\"The Sociology of Music,\\" but that title had already been used.	2001-03-17

I am not, at least as the term has been perverted in the contemporary USA (but if conserving the natural environment is the most conservative position of all, then I'm a radical conservative!).  Despite this ideological difference, I find her aesthetic position on American popular music quite compelling.<br /><br />Her saving grace is her love of African-American music!  The core of her analysis is her distinction among three types of modernism:  introverted, extroverted, and perverse.  The book is motivated by her outrage at such recent youth music genres as gangsta rap, heavy metal and punk, which she sees as the outcomes of perverse modernism.  (I tend to agree with her that much of heavy metal and rap are reactionary, but part ways with her on punk.)<br /><br />She tours the 20th century, though, only dealing with these contemporary forms toward the end, and her treatment of blues, rhythm and blues, and soul is excellent, showing her love of and respect for the music and the musicians.  Her analysis of Chuck Berry and Elvis is one of the highlights.  Don't expect much coverage of jazz.  She respects it (putting it in the category of extroverted modernism), but doesn't seem to listen to it much.<br /><br />Without agreeing with all her judgements, I strongly recommend HOLE IN OUR SOUL to anyone interested in popular American music, and the African-American tradition in particular.	2001-03-17
