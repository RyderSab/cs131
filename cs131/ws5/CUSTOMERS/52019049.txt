US	52019049	R2SGNEVB04IP87	0972634401	238433775	The Heretic of the North	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	About MUCH MORE than a heretic of the north	On the back cover Heretic of the North is described as Orius Candell's fight/quest to fight against a new threat to the world. This is true, but there is so much more going on in this story. In addition to Orius Candell there is Pendros the lechorous iron merchant, Tarik the royal messenger, Jurdana the high priestess, and Rodrigo the King. All of these 'supporting' characters are so well developed that they might as well be described as co-main characters.<br />The fantasy world that Brommer has developed is detailed, realistic, and complex. The above characters are interspersed throughout the world and it is interesting to watch as seemingly unrelated events start to effect each other.<br />Due to the complexity the book started out slow (for me). All these characters to remember. All these details about the world. It was hard for me to keep it all straight. Once I got past the first couple chapters, however, I realized why all of it was necessary. The 'final' battle was very detailed and it was obvious that Brommer had done a ton of research on medieval/age of discovery combat. It didn't descend into a text book description of battle either. I was on the edge of my seat. I didn't know if the army was going to be routed!<br />If you like political intrigue in a fantasy world mixed with plenty of action and adventure then Heretic of the North is for you.	2004-04-04

This is partially because of Adam's long life but it is also because of the detail that McCullough pursues his subject. While many books that go into detail can drag this book is a page turner. Partial responsibility for this must go to Adams for having lived an interesting life but we must also give credit to the author. My only other exposure to McCullough was a biography on early Teddy Roosevelt. It was also an easy read.<br />I have recently read books on Jefferson and Franklin. This was far more interesting than the Jefferson book and equal to Franklin. If you find the founding fathers interesting you will love this book!	2003-01-31

It was long and focused on romance. It wanted to be Titanic set in Stalingrad. Very little of this book is devoted to Vassili Zaitsev (unlike the movie). It is instead about the entire battle for Stalingrad (and the horrible famine, freezing, and loss of life). This book does what any good book on war does......make you want to avoid it if possible. Any rating less than five stars is an insult to this book.	2002-04-04

It first must have an interesting subject and second it must have a writer with talent. I got this book as a gift and was pleasantly surprised to find that both requirements were met. Never had an interest in TR before but McCullough does a good job of drawing you into his world. He also shows some interesting personality quirks including the fact that he never mentioned his first marriage (with ended in the brides tragic death due to sickness) in his own biography.	2002-04-04

The China book, however, was difficult to get through. I think part of the reason is that China is too big. I've tried other books on Chinese history and they all seem to have the same problem. There is so much going on its hard to get a feel for each time period. To get a more intimate look China's history would probably have to be studied by region (or by periods).	2002-03-31

It focuses, however, on two personalities (Gates and Jobs). The making of the personal computer, however, was much more than a war between two egos. What about all those companies that are no longer around anymore? If you liked the TV documentary you will love Fire in the Valley. Buy it!	2002-03-31

Why would they do it? What were their motivations? What do they have in common. Equally interesting is the individual who actually accomplished his exploration but was accused of pulling a hoax. He had all the evidence to prove his claim but would not use it! Why? His psyche had common ground with hoaxsters. To find out more you will have to read the book. It is an interesting read.	2002-03-31

To the casual reader of history (like myself) it is a bit of a drag. The book has highlights but the authors are writing it to their contemporaries. It is difficult for the modern reader to grasp exactly what is happening. I think a book with maps and further explanations as to motivations and battle tactics (to a layman like me) would have been of greater interest. One thing I can say, however, is that you get a first hand look at what Caesar must have been like. The book clearly shows his side in the most favorable light (not surprising) but not as much as one would think.	2002-03-31
US	52019049	R2JVTD4GCLH6MQ	1578260302	527598967	The Complete Guide to Paintball	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Lives up to its name as the COMPLETE guide to Paintball	I'm relatively new to paintball and I wanted to get a book on it. I had the choice between the Ultimate Guide to Paintball and the Complete Guide to Paintball. I chose the Ultimate Guide because it was published later. That was a real mistake (you can read my review on the Ultimate Guide).<br />When you first pick up this book you realize that someone put alot of work into it. The Ultimate Guide was published by a magazine company. It became obvious right away that they said, &quot;Hey lets put a bunch of magazine articles together for a book!!!&quot;.<br />The Complete Guide, however, did some leg work. They put some time into interviews which are all fascinating. Will these interviews help you to become a better player? Technically no. They just give you the background of where paintball came from and how it evolved to be todays game.<br />It is also interesting that most of those interviewed do not like the progression the game has made (smaller fields, faster shooting guns, and tons of paint being used). They all admit, however, these changes were necessary to make paintball profitable. The strange thing is Bud Orr felt the same way even though the Autococker is one of the fastest shooting guns out there. Enjoyment of the game vs. sound business I guess.<br />What if you are not interested in the history of the game and the interesting personalities involved? Well there are chapters on improving your game. There is also sound advice on upgrading and being a sniper. The book is honest, however, and admits that playing the game is the way to improve. You probably are not going to get full return on your money if you are only interested in improving your game. The first 3 parts are devoted to history, guns (which has alot of history from the gun makers), and gear. You can get most of the guns and gear info out of magazines and websites.<br />I should also mention the pictures. They are beautiful. In color, up close, and personal. They do become a little redundant (how many ways can you show someone shooting a gun) but its better than the black and white photos in the Ultimate Guide to Paintball.	2001-07-12
US	52019049	R2ZQ5L80DUY2RR	0809225492	499183740	Ultimate Guide To Paintball	Books	2	16	18	N	Y	Its an okay read but hardly ultimate....	When you hear the word ULTIMATE GUIDE you expect to be pretty comprehensive. This book would have better been titled the GENERAL GUIDE.... I'm pretty new to paintball and even I didn't find too much to learn from this book.<br />A perfect example is how it handles equipment. For an ULTIMATE guide you would expect it to talk about upgrades to markers. It should list the common upgrades and give a WHAT (what is the upgrade and a description), WHO (who should really look at this upgrade), PROS (what is good about getting this type of upgrade), and CONS (why you might not like this upgrade). This book instead spends alot of time talking about &quot;my first tournament&quot; and &quot;paintball is one of the fastest growing sports...&quot;<br />Don't get me wrong. There are good things about this book as well. I liked the advanced formations chapter and beginner advice (don't brandish your paintball marker in public.....it may sound obvious but there is always that one idiot). As an ULTIMATE guide, however, it is lacking.<br />You may want to check out the Complete Guide to Paintball. I haven't looked at it myself but at least the pictures are in color.Supposedly it has a listing of fields as well.	2001-06-14

It is difficult to get the true facts from over 1000 years ago. Most of us who are interested in history are not really interested in in facts but in well told stories. This book has plenty of the latter. I would not quote what ... [I] read in this book to others as FACT but I would probably share some of the viking stories to anyone willing to listen. Only four stars as the book drags towards the end.	2001-05-11

According to Herodotus Amazons lived near the Black Sea. Later historians have ridiculed Herodotus for having many &quot;fanciful&quot; tales but recent excavations have discovered women buried with spears etc. As the author points out Herodotus most &quot;fanciful&quot; tales are qualified with &quot;I have heard&quot; and some he doubts himself. All in all I believe that the reader will be amazed at the knowledge of the ancients rather than their lack of knowledge.	2001-04-29

The author points out at near the end of the book that Drake was the right man at the right time. On Drake's later expeditions (that were failures) the Spanish had fortified their holdings in the new world to a point that made it more difficult for privateers. This, however, does not detract from Drake's earlier success which would not have been accomplished by men of lesser genius.	2001-04-28

All in all, however, a great book.	2001-04-28

When reading history it is good to get several different perspectives so as not to get too &quot;biased&quot; a view. After looking through several books, however, I noticed that most of them fit in the &quot;unreadable&quot; category so I broke down and bought one from an author I new would be readable. Alison Weir did not disappoint. Not only was the book informative about Eleanor of Aquitaine (as much as can be known from surviving information) but we get a good look at her husbands and sons. I've heard people say that Alison Weir is biased towards a woman's perspective. I have never felt that was true and I think that was evident in this book. She tries to show both sides of her subject and also spends a good deal of praise on her husband Henry (as well as some shortcomings, we all have them after all).	2001-04-28

The only thing I don't like is the index. I know that is petty, but with a book like this it is important. In the book you can look up houses by neighborhood but there is not a reference that shows the page number. Why is this bad? Lets say I wanted to go for a walk and look at some old Portland architecture. If the index were set up properly I could look at which neighborhood I was going to and then reference the page to see if it was still standing (very important) and if it was something I really wanted to look at!	2001-04-28

Here is a book that has not only has Drake, Magellan, and Columbus but has the story of less famous mariners as well. This is not a book that has to be read all at once. You can read about one of the explorers and when you are sick of reading about storms and starvation put it aside for awhile.	2001-04-28

This book (like &quot;Children&quot;) was a fascinating read. The author clearly has sympathy for the wives but does not dismiss Henry as &quot;a womanizer who got rid of his wives on personal whim&quot;. The only thing I disliked about this book was the authors detail on which surviving portraits are there of each wife and ones that have been falsly attributed to them. As I can't look at the pictures in question I really don't care!!!! All in all I would heartily recommend both the &quot;Six Wives&quot; and &quot;Children&quot; to any history buff.	2001-02-14

The only related book I have ever read was a biography on Sir Francis Drake. I was in the bookstore, however, and was tempted to read the author's forward. Her style is so personal that I was immediately captured. It doesn't matter if you are interested in British royalty. If you are interested in politics and how they are affected by interesting personalities you will love this book.<br />The only complaint I had was that very little information was provided on Elizabeth I (ruling years). I understand that she had a long reign and that there are several other books that go into her story but Alison Weir could have given us a forward to her next book. Maybe she felt that would have been too commercial...	2001-01-20

This book (and its mate Flamesong) offer a world that is both complex and  believable.  I have found that most fans are people who roleplay in this  world, but anyone will enjoy this book (as I have never even seen the  game).

It seems that Scipio Africanus had ALL the qualities we desire in leaders. I found myself devouring this book for both historical interest and moral teachings.  The only failing of this book is that the author so loves  Scipio Africanus he makes out other great commanders (Hannibal, Alexander,  etc) out to be lucky fools.  In his defence the book I read on Hannibal did  not hint at the true genius of Scipio Africanus.	1999-02-10

The world is so rich and so different from what we always see in fantasy books.  I am not even a real fantasy genre fan.
