Rylan North is the famous actor chosen to act the part in Kirsten Dumm biographical portrait of her husband. When he asked to come and stay with her so he can channel her husband she is against it, and so begins this tug and war between  the starcrossed lovers. She eventually allows him to stay with her. He then starts to fall for her but he is not sure if her feelings for him is real or if she is channeling her husband's love on him. Interesting read, I have read better titles by the author, but I enjoyed this because I always like seeing the hero fighting for the woman. Unlike my fellow reviewers I did not buy it i borrowed it from the local library and even if I did buy it I think it would be worth the cash.	2005-09-01

Instead all I got was a lot of unanswered questions. Mary just had a child and is unfilled by her husband, who stays out long hours supposedly working. Walter her gay Episcopal friend is looking for love in all the wrong places, and John the monk who just left the monastery that Mary ends up having a sexual relationship with.The author intertwoves religion and sex that part I did not get. Did not enjoy but felt I needed to complete this book at least to see what happens and yet everything still was not tied in. I know not all books come to a full conclusion but this one left you hanging long before it was close to ending.	2005-06-04

Ted Burger is somewhat your typical teenager. He plays the guitar likes the group \\"shakes the clown, and is a bit of a clown himself. On average day he hangs out with his best friend Mark and Mark's girlfriend Nikki.After school they usually hang out at the Circle Eat diner. One day it so happen the cook who worked there and was eventually fired came back and told them he poison the fries and whoever eats them will die of a fast death. Since Ted usually order fries and was starting to feel sick he begins to belive the cook and so he starts telling you how it feels to be dying and knowing you have lest than 24 hours. It took me reading practically midway to realise perhaps he is not going to die.Ted eventually begins having a list that his friend Mark put together of things Ted should do before he dies. In conclusion as said before I started reading it thinking it was going to be sad because of the character death only to find out its a tongue in cheek book about death.In the end I did not really enjoy this book.I felt the author was making a joke about death which I do not see as funny.	2005-04-14

It is great to read a book where the characters are black and are shown in a positive light. Nate is a black man who has suceeded to the point where he runs his own company. Monica his wife, is a manager at a men's clothing store but she works only because she likes to have her own money but there is really no need for her to work. And so start this interesting book. The minute Nate marries Monica he wants to start having children but she convince him she was not ready, to young and that she wanted it to be just the two of them for a while. Fast forward three years later and she has now decided its time only to find out she has premature menopause and cannot have children. When this is found out by her husband it sends him spiraling into what he can do to get out of his marriage to her so he can be with a woman who can have children, only to be told by his lawyer that if he divorce her he will have to give her half of his fortune. This is when the conniving Nate decides to set his wife up to cheat so she could not get any of his money. Though this might seem over the top i find that the plot is believable i am sure this has been done in real life. One of the wonderful thing about this book is you can feel the characters angusish of moments where they have to make decisions. The end was not too suprising because i am a romantic by heart. Excellent read and very thought provoking it begs the question what would you do if this was to happen to you?	2005-03-18

I know poetry is used many a times in books to explain either the characters of something that has happened, but in this book i felt it distracted me from the real story just my oponion. This book is about Megan Tuw a popular high school girl who befriends the school geek or as they called her the freak when they meet each other in detention. The plot is very believable about Megan trying to be nice to this outcast Perdita and still wanting to be liked by her clique. As Megan hangs more with Perdita she realizes she is not just a freak but there is more to this girl. Megan finds out Perdita passion for poetry  and things that really matter and not just how you looked.You could feel the turmoil Megan goes through and will fully feel her pain at the end of this book.

This is the first in a series of books that focus on the young and rich of the upper east side and the other teens that envy them.

The book is narrated by Tasha, who tells you the trials of been a teenage mother. In the beginning of this book I told myself this was going to be a typical story of a black pregnant teen but  I was totally wrong. The book gets real with Tasha sharing about how she became pregnant and having to deal with the shame because of it, her having  to keep up with her school work while trying to take care of her child. She speaks about the other characters in her life like the<br /><br /> tumultuous relationship with her mother, having a best friend Eboni (who is also pregnant) Eboni's mother Ms. Lovey who sometimes serves as Tasha surrogate mother<br /><br /> when her own mother was unable to give Tasha the love she felt she needed<br /><br /> and the boy Tasha begins to \\"date\\" Peanut (his nickname)This book shows<br /><br />the realism of the inner city tragedy of pregnant teen and the continuation of the cycle. It is also a book about hope, sadness, perseverance and redemption. Readers beware that this books have twist and turns that you would not have expected . In my opinion this book became more sadder in the end but a story that definitely needed to be told. Excellent writing.	2005-01-28

In the usual romance the hero waits to the last minute to tell her his true feelings but not in this title.<br /><br />I also liked the great sex scenes not as good as \\"awaken to pleasure\\" but good enough. I love that the author showed how hurt the sheik was after being left years ago by Jasmine and how she had to fight to show him this time around she will never desert him again. Very touching and heart wrenching especially after finding out how her family wanted the \\"the other sister\\" to have him instead of her. Great read.	2004-12-28

The book  is about Evie Burrman and it is told through the eyes of her younger brother Parr. The Burrman family live on a  farm typical of that area in  Missouri. Evie has always been a unique girl. Out of the three children she was the one who knew how to fix many of the mechanic things though she was the girl. She dressed like a man and was a loner. Her parents especially her mother  knew she was different but tried to change her. The mother thought that inviting over Cord (a boy who liked her) trying to get her to dress more womanly would change her. Everything comes full circle when the banker's daughter started befriended Evie. Parr from his narration conveys the feelings of the family especially how the mom and dad knew this was no ordinary girlfriend friendship. Parr discusses what happens when the relationship becomes known and how he and the family deal with the neighbors when rumors begin to flow. The book not only touches on Evie situation but Doug (the oldest son) going off to college and eventually deciding not taking up a life on the farm and Parr wrestling with guilt of not wanting the farm life and his coming of age with a relationship with a young lady name Angel. I think it is a great book for teens who may also be going through feelings like Evie or not sure of how they feel.	2004-12-20

In this romance title the hero tells his heroine from the beginning his love for her.

She begins wondering if that's all she is to him a bedmate. Eventually he ask her to come and travel with him. Before she does so she finds out she is pregnant. She runs away after telling him about it because she did not like the tone of how he spoke about the baby. This is basically the author's way of bringing conflict to the book to  give it a happy conclusion. I felt the conflict did not have merit since she knew he loved her and shared private stories of family and past loves with here. Okay read good amount of sexual overtones.	2004-12-15

This is Ms. Davidson first novel and what a first impression she has made. The book is about two African American teenagers who are total opposite. Jason, the star athlete who is gorgeous and dress smartly and Kyra, the nerd who does not bother to perm her hair but braid it and who is not into designer clothes. They have notice each other  before but were never in the same circle. They are eventually brought together by an English Project. In the beginning they had  preconceived ideas about each other ,she thinking he is a dumb jock and he thinking she is all about being a brain. They eventually start falling for each other, the catch is Jason already has a girlfriend Lisa. The book goes into detail about their growing affection to love for each other. The book also touches  very deep topics. Jason having to deal with an alcoholic father who is also a widower. Jason mother died when he was three years old. The book also discusses Kyra studying hard to win a Science contest and Jason trying to win the state championship. Both of them had to deal with criticism from their fellow students thinking they togetherness must be a lame joke. Though I am not a teenager the book is very believable an example of that is Jason  having to deal with the fact that his new girlfriend Kyra is not ready to go all the way, him coming from a relationship where he was getting it all the time. In these scenes in  the book you see the angst between his deep feeling of him trying to be patient and her wanting to but being scared great read. I look forward to this author next novel.	2004-12-11

I became interested in this book because while I was working at the information desk (I am a librarian) someone ask me about a book pertaining to rape. I limited my search and this title came up. Are you in the house alone? Is a dated book. It is about upper class  teenager whites in suburbia in the late 1970's. Though it might seem dated for a teenager in this era to read I think they will still be intrigued. It focuses on the main character Gail and her family who recently moved from New York City. The book discusses her relationship with her boyfriend Steve and them being lovers and she been on birth control. The mention of these topic surprised  me since this book was written in a time when this topic was taboo. Since I knew the book had to do with rape I begin wondering how it will happen. It seems that someone has been watching Gail and she has no idea who it is. She begins getting very sexual depraved notes  and phone calls stating what will be done to her when the individual comes to her. She shares it with a friend and a counselor who all think its just some boy trying to scare her. I never understand why she never told her parents but she never did and eventually gets rape. The readers will be shock to find out who the rapist is and  how she deals with knowing her rapist. Interesting read but hated the conclusion. Though I know what happen after the rape is realistic I did not want it to be concluded this way and then again for the time it was written somewhat understandable.	2004-12-11

This is the second book I have read of Giles and like the previous one this too leaves you gasping for more. Matt is a high school senior who is not one of the popular students. Barely any one notices him, except his two similar personality friends Jeremy and Ken. Then one day the school slut and goth girl Skye begins to notices him and want him as her boyfriend/lover. They both keep their affair a secret for different reasons which is eventually layed out as the book progresses. As you start in on the first few pages you get curious to Skye motives, is she setting him up for a big joke to the rest of the school in a school dance  party or is it possible she may really like him. This book will have you speed reading to see what happens next. As with her last book I did not like how it ended and here she continues the trend of leaving you the reader hanging. When you read the book you will see why I have said this. With that in mind though, the characters are well written  and their thoughts  are truely believable that these could be teenagers we the audience know. Great read.

I am not suprise she made the jump to fiction/thriller books. Though this book is a romance book, her characters have very strong personalities and extremly real. Yes the chances of meeting a Deke Sargent who is a lawyer and having a one night stand and falling in love is very slim. I still could feel the chemistry between these two characters right from the opening of the first few words in this book. Laney finds herself in an elevator with an handsome stranger. Not long after being in there, a black out happens and they are stuck. Deke(the hero) tries to comfort her because she is claustraphobic. Eventually the lights come back on but she is extremly traumatize. He takes her to his apartment to revive her. This invite turn out to be more than just reviving her but a hot making out scene where they end up in bed. In the morning she accuses him of rape because he gave her wine which made her drunk. He told her she wanted him just as much. She ended up sneaking out of his apartment without his knowledge. Finally he tracks her down and finds out she is pregnant. The rest of the books bascially deals with her insecurities and doubt of his love. Great romance book. It makes you want to read it over and over again.	2004-11-27

It started off that the hero/bachelor Jackson runs into his heroine Taylor while she was waiting for her bus in the rain. What I liked about this book is how sensitive and emotional the hero was to his ladylove right away. Usually in the romance genre the man waits till the last minute to prove his love but in this one he feels for her right away. Also their are some touching moments where the hero helps her fight for custody of her younger brother from her step- father.In this book both Jackson and Taylor had broken hearts from before him with a dead ex-wife who cheated on him and her being physical and emotional abuse by various individuals in her life.

Though it was a romance book it could have read like any fiction book. Meet Mallory a woman who is in charge of a powerful cosmetic company. She happens to meet Rafael through visiting his sister. Eventually his daughter becomes attached to her immensly and would not allow Mallory to go back to California. In conclusion there was not a lot of love scenes which was okay that to me made it even more realistic a  man and his child and the women putting the child's needs before hers:it was about a woman falling in love with a motherless child and her father. It was really a good read.	2004-08-02

As a black woman I am not fully happy with some of the black writers out there and so I never truly ventured into a lot of black genre. &quot;He is just a friend&quot; caught my eye after I read the plot on the front jacket. Fancy is the main character in the book. She is a woman you love to hate. She has sex with men to keep her expensive lifestyle. Desmond a brother who truly cares for her she ignores because he is a mechanic and she only calls him when she is in trouble.The characters I ended up liking was Savoy and Tyronne. Savoy is a religious sister who is a virgin and is saving herself. She begins to be attracted to Tyronne who is considered a bad boy. What I like about these characters were when Tyronne found out Savoy cared about him he did not take advantage of her he took his time, at one point he told her she was too good for him. In conclusion I was not fully happy with the ending but I like that Savoy and Tyronne ended up together.	2004-07-20

The book discusses on an average day what she does. She sometimes go to the ma suprette to wire money to her uncle, she spends time with her friends Shoggy and Bobby (this character later comes in Johnson book called first part last). Marley narration through out the book let you realize her family is not a bad one. Her world comes tumbling down when she finds out that the people she has called mom and pops all her life are really her aunt and uncle and the uncle that she has been wiring money too is her real father. The book has many little chapters with different headings that focus on the specific title in each. It shows Marley emotions going up and down on the reality of her world and how she eventually deals with seeing her real dad coming to visit. A great read!	2004-07-13

I then started reading and felt saddened for this character. A Young girl who off and on has self esteem issues. She believes she does not fit into her family and  she goes through the usual girl angst liking a boy who does not seem to take notice of her. In the end she is introduce to drugs by some classmates. This starts her into a spiral of drugs and sex. The Young lady never has sex without the drugs, in some of her entry in this diary(that supposedly at first glance is real) she hopes to someday enjoy sex without the drugs. As I was reading this book and reasearching to see if it could be found who this is individual is i found out it was not a real person but a work of fiction written by a Dr. Beatrice Sparks. To me it did take away a little of how i felt about the book. I thought  it did not make sense for her to kill off the character after she had been through so much(running away coming back and being in a mental institution and getting help) That was never explain which left me to believe that the good old doctor just wanted to shock teens into the reality of drugs. I commend and will reommend this book but yet i felt she should not have killed off the character after pages of pages of her trying to get help eventhough, i know in the real word addicts do die trying to stay clean.	2004-07-11

I started hearing about \\"down low\\" behaviour approximately two years ago and was shocked and intrigue to know what that was about. In this book Mr. King get as detailed as possible about the sub-culture that is black men who do not consider themselves gay but have sex with other black men. For any woman who have always have an instinct something is not right in their relationship with a man should read this book. What is also very alarming this behavior is believed to be the culprit in why Black Women are gettign Aids at an alarming rate.Like Mr. King says not every man is a dl, but I feel this book should be read by every woman who is in a committed relationship so they can know exactly what is out there. It is no longer another woman they have to think about but possibly a man which can be even more detrimental physical and emotionally. Interesting read.	2004-06-26

I feel like her books are believable though they are labeled romance. I enjoy the characters Trent and Rana(Ana)tremendously. The book subject was about Rana getting  tired with her life as a supermodel and how she goes into seclusion for six months and rents a room far away from New York City. As usual the heroine(Ana aka Rana) fights off the attraction of Trent (the alpha male) but eventually succumbed to liking him to loving him. I like that the book teaches you that beauty is not whats only on  the outside  but what a man and woman character and personality is all about.	2004-06-18

The book looks into the life of Nick and him getting married after a two month affair with marketing executive call 'trish' real name Patricia. Nick is a trader in London who cannot believe his good luck on finding such a wonderful woman. The book gets into detail of their sexual encounters. Trish becomes pregnant nearly immediately and the couple is excited. Just when you were start thinking this an interesting version of a romance book reality kicks in and in walks Joe Sommervile Trish ex who wants her back.<br />The story is shown from the angle of Nick who know has to deal with his wife choosing him or her ex. What I like about this book was how realistic it was about human pain, suffering and torment in relationships. In many scenes it showed trish going back and forth sexual with Nick like not only was she confused emotionally but sexually as well. I felt this element played very real though she was hurting her husband by doing so. I wanted to hate her for putting her husband through the torture and I wanted to be angry at Nick for allowing his wife to enter in and out of his life and having him sexually which i felt did not allow him to move on. I could feel Nick's pain Trish betrayal and Joe (...)for making her choose. I think its a great debut novel from this author and I look forward to his next novel.	2004-05-15
US	44880862	RAY3T9B1WHIQZ	0689863888	369585790	Looking for Red	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Gone but not forgotten	I personally hate anything sad. I know things happen but reading about it is even more hard to deal with. This book is about Michaela called 'mike' for short, she narrates about how one day her brother disappears. The book is told in many variation, from current to past times. You have to really pay attention because if not you can miss what is going on. It was kind of hard to read but it really is about a young girl talking fondly of her older brother. I was confused at first about how he died but in the end it explains exactly what happened to him. I did not like that it did not explain why Mona his girlfriend left...meaning  did she leave the neighborhood? I wish the author would have given a better conclusion. I personally like everything coming to an end when the book is finished. Altogether it was a very moving story.	2004-05-01

The story is told by Rick, who is friends with the quarterback and this new individual called Jake. Right away you sense something is not right. Jake begins to have a party every friday night at his house, before you know it he is the man to know. As others have said in their reviews this novel is very similar to The Great Gatsby. The school is even named Fitzgerald. In this version nobody gets killed but they are some serious issues that arise. To me the book comes alive with the way the author describes the emotions of the characters. It makes me begin to imagine how they look. To me this is a not just another typical teenager book about high school life but it actually has some morals and values to learn.	2004-04-17

It takes up where Lena and her sister Dion runaway from their sexually abusive father.<br />The books discusses the various journey through the cities and towns and the characters who pick them up.This book made me very sad it felt so real and that is why I gave it five stars. It tears at the heartstring. I felt better knowing that the children journey through the various towns were not in vain. A great inspirational book about facing odds and overcoming them eventhough the characters were very young.	2004-01-16

Bobby just found out he is going to be a father. Here lies the beginning of a wonderful story written by Angela Johnson. The book is in two parts. They are title Now and Then. The author takes you to before and after the arrival of the baby Feather. Bobby is a teenage boy who found out his girlfriend Nia is expecting. The book describes Bobby, Nia and their family feelings on the baby. The book to me is a wondeful take on the reality of teen pregnancy. On a sad note the readers find out that Nia is in a form of coma where she is in a vegative state for the rest of her life after giving birth to the baby. Wonderful read for  tweens and teens who are intimate with one another. They could read this and comprehend somewhat the huge responsibility of having a baby as a teen.	2003-12-18

This is where the book takes a turn not expected. Brad becomes engage to a beautiful busty blonde and right away certain feelings started coming in Sam's mind.

I truly enjoyed it gave it 3 stars because it is romance after all and i had an idea of the plot before it ended. In the end a truly good read.	2003-10-27

The tables have change in which the black girl is the one who is well off and the white girl is very poor. The book is written from Marie's view. She met her through school where the first day she sat next to her. Both girls soon realize they have a lot in common both their mothers are no longer around. Marie's mother abandoned her and her dad and Lena's mother died of cancer. The book deals with a very sensitive subject about sexual abuse which Lena's dad does to her. The abuse though is slightly touched upon.I believe the author really touched the heart with this book it was very sad but yet it's stuff that happens every day highly recommend great for book discussion for children pertaining to race relation and possible an introducion to knowing about abuse.	2003-10-04
