This was my first time reading anything from the author but best believe it won't be the last. The author hit some very important facts about God, work-place, employement, relationships, etc. The two most important ones to me: be careful who you talk to in your work-place b/c they might not be who they say they are, they might end up being the one to save your job and always put God first when making a decision and you can't go wrong. Please pick this book up and enjoy every page from beginning to end.	2005-09-07

Please leave this book alone	This book is boring and stupid. I skipped numerous pages and still could pick up with the story without feeling like I didn't read some important information. The reason being is because there are a lot of pages that don't list anything important so I skipped it. In other words pages of useless information. I would give this book 2 starts. Some things were ok but I wouldn't ever recommend this book to anyone else who loves a good read such as myself. My sister also attempted to read this book and stopped before she reached page 20. Every one is entitled to their opinion so you decide? But I didn't like it. I found myself rolling my eyes and feeling pressured to finish it. When I did I was more disappointed with the sorry ending just as the entire book. Read \\"Saved in the City\\" by Jacquelin Thomas now that is a good book.	2005-05-20
