On the whole, the coverage of Austrian towns and cities in this book is so comprehensive that it would be difficult to judge much of it fairly without having been to these places. However, I reviewed the parts of this book about some of the places with which I had familiarity. Generally, I found the descriptions insightful and accurate from my own observations. <br />We stayed once in a tiny town with the two-letter name of \\"Au\\" in Vorarlberg, the western-most province of Austria, next to Switzerland. This book says that it is \\"an undeniably attractive spot\\" and \\"If you are looking for a rural break, this as good a place to stay and rest up as any.\\" After spending a couple of days in Au, I had concluded pretty much the same thing. <br />Regarding the village of Heiligenblut, which sits at the base of the Grossglockner, the highest mountain in Austria, in the southern province of Kaernten, the authors describe it as \\"one of the most attractively situated villages in the Austrian Alps\\". Indeed, it is. The writers characterize the valley where Heiligenblut is located as remarkably steep-sided. Having stayed in a farmhouse far up one of those slopes, I can attest to the fear of a slight misstep in parking near the edge of the incline. But the view of the village far below was spectacular.<br />As regards accommodations, this book seems to favor hotels over smaller more reasonable accommodations such as those of the \\"Urlaub am Bauernhof\\" or \\"Vacation on the Farm\\" type, which are widely available across Austria. For example, there are several in Au and Heiligenblut. These accommodations are quite popular with Germans and the Austrians themselves. The atmosphere and hospitality at such places is most often quite warm and friendly. The Internet would provide more information about these accommodations than this book.<br />I would not bother much with the authors' recommendations about restaurants and places to eat. The fact of the matter is that there are far more good places to eat than mediocre ones in the whole of Austria. <br />The authors have researched the historical background of Austria well. It is often difficult to understand the significance of many of the things one sees in a country like Austria where history is rich and deep. For example, Aggstein castle in the Wachau is just another ruined castle without knowing that it was twice in its long history the stronghold of robber barons who preyed on ships on the Danube and lies in ruins from the actions of the Turkish army in the 16th century. <br />If you are debating whether or not to buy this book, consider two things. It is relatively inexpensive, and it is much more often accurate than not.	2003-12-01
US	42494427	R148SE5XQ7SY9F	0345457102	853719964	Choice Cuts: A Savory Selection of Food Writing from Around the World and Throughout History	Books	3	6	7	N	Y	Gourmets and Gourmands	CHOICE CUTS<BR>Mark Kurlansky, Editor<BR>ISBN 0-345-45710-2<br />This book, a collection of writing about food, drags somewhat from the burden of including too much arcane material, for example Pliny the Elder's note on onions from the first century. Elsewhere, another chapter devotes too many words to the difference between a gourmet and a gourmand, which is perhaps not as critical to the reader as to the editor. <br />There are some excellent pieces in this book however. Among the best are the articles by M. F. K. Fisher, who was a food writer, but felt that food, security, and love are entwined. She also wrote very well. Her story about a last meal at a favorite restaurant before leaving France in 1932 is warm and witty. Fisher almost did not get the last meal because a waiter failed to recognize her and her husband. He spotted her precious accordion she was carrying on to the ship, assumed that they were street musicians, and showed them the door. In another article, Fisher writes about bachelors' cooking, \\"few of them under seventy-nine will bother to produce a good meal unless it is for a pretty woman.\\"<br />Another fine piece by Jeremy Wechsberg about a restaurant in Vienna before the war, where the boiled beef specialties required a customer to have a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of a steer, is one of my favorites. The restaurant kept herds of cattle, fed with molasses and sugar beet mash to supply its pampered customers. The story, written in 1948, reflects a past lifestyle to which few of us could relate. It was said that Austrian poets lavished rhymed praise upon the delicacies they consumed at \\"Meissl & Schadn\\".<br />The George Orwell article about cooks and waiters in Paris is the writer at his best. The waiters made more than the cooks, and the waiters had the mentality of snobs. A shorter piece about English food is equally good. In it, Orwell offers, \\"England is a very good country when you are not poor.\\" I also admired John Steinbeck's articleabout hunger in California during the depression. Steinbeck wrote that, when children starved, the coroners wrote \\"malnutrition\\" on the death certificate because is sounded better \\"when a thin child is dead in a tent\\".<br />This book offers a number of satisfying entrees, even for those whose main interests are other than food. However, one has to get through too many bland side dishes between them.	2003-03-29

Buck has an unpretentious writing style. One who reads his book may gain insight about the pilot's perspective on that next trip across the Atlantic and hope that someone like Buck is flying the plane.<br />Much difficulty and uncertainty faced the pilots of early passenger planes like the DC-2 and DC-3. The engines were temperamental and navigation was crude. Pilots often maintained their orientation by following railroad tracks, highways, and rivers in the day and by the stars at night. The crew accommodations at the end of the flights were anything but luxurious. <br />Buck met some interesting people along the way, such as the actor Tyrone Power, who flew cargo planes in WWII. They once flew around the world together, and Power, who died at the age of forty-four, was a decent person, who attributed the adulation of the crowds to the parts he played rather than to himself. Howard Hughes was another that Buck knew well. He was a rather polite man, Buck found, but one who insisted on being involved in every project down to the smallest detail. People were often kept waiting for decisions in Hughes' far-flung enterprises. Buck also briefly met Amelia Earhart, who came along in the heyday of spectacular flying. He thinks that she tried to fly planes beyond her experience. She had about eight accidents during takeoffs and landings, and she, generally, was not regarded by other pilots as a good pilot. <br />Buck also writes about the early flyer and writer, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, who wrote the books, THE LITTLE PRINCE and the image-rich WIND, SAND, and STARS. Of a flight along the coast of Africa, where Saint-Exupery had flown the mail, Buck writes \\"I looked down, on the lonely barren land, thinking of him and the other pilots flying their ancient Breguet XIVs ... that periodically failed and dropped them down on the lonely sandscape, and sometimes into unfriendly arms.\\"<br />During this book, Buck is seldom on the ground for long, and there are enough stories of airplane excursions to satisfy the most avid fans of aviation. But Buck also includes interesting details about some of the places visited. For example, about a flight to the island of Iwo Jima, where 24,000 were killed in WWII, Buck observes that the island was \\"a flat featureless place; it held no beauty, no tenderness, nothing forgiving, it was simply a place to kill and be killed.\\"<br />Buck recollects the days of flying by the stars, and he writes that the romance and skill of being guided by them is something that future flyers will never experience. Sometimes, he says, he stands outside on a clear, winter night and just looks up at \\"my old friends Sirius, Vega, and Polaris\\".	2002-12-17

It is commendable that Christopher Hitchens singles him out as a writer that matters. But I am somewhat disappointed in this book.<br />The book is not a biography. Hitchens writes about Orwell's books and ideas rather than his personal life, but he includes so little about the latter that one has difficulty determining Orwell's circumstances. For example, Hitchens tells us that Orwell's father was a non-factor in his life, but he hardly makes clear why. Elsewhere, he informs us that Orwell, who he says was awkward with women, married twice. Again, a little background on the marriages might be helpful.<br />Hitchens sets out to defend Orwell against attacks by writers, politicians, and assorted adversaries. The book has too many such defenses.  Hitchens devotes so much energy to these pursuits that in the end it is, it seems, the quality of the portrayal of Orwell's work, that is sacrificed. Not enough of the clear, unpretentious feel of Orwell's writing comes through in this book.<br />Hitchens does call attention a number of times to Orwell's fine essay , \\"On Politics and the English Language\\". In this essay, among other things, Orwell laid out some simple rules for straightforward, honest writing. One of these rules, for example, is \\"Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\\" Although  Hitchens may be Orwell's advocate, he seems not a practitioner of his writing guidelines.  Consider Hitchens' sentence, for example, \\"Notwithstanding this elaborate disavowal or \\"dementi\\", authors in need of a quick fix continued to use even the clapped-out Labourism of the late 1970s as a template for sub-Orwellian literary enterprises.\\"<br />Toward the end of this book, Hitchens writes that Orwell's thought haslargely been vindicated by time and that he \\"need not seek any pardon on that score\\". Exactly, his work stands alone sufficiently not to have required the earlier defenses. In summary, Hitchens also offers that Orwell had a \\"commitment to language as the partner of truth\\". This pithy synopsis of his work gets to the heart of Orwell's writing. I wish the rest of the book were as apropos.	2002-11-18

In the author's earlier book, GERMAN BOY, he wrote about his own childhood as a refugee during the war and the debt he owed his mother. In this book, he interviews survivors and learns the details of their stories. Some did not wish to relive those years, but did so reluctantly with the writer's encouragement. He was one of them. The reader is privileged to experience these accounts, some of which were not previously shared with anyone. <br />One must steel oneself to read events in these stories.  Some of the things that happened are terrifying and difficult to confront. They are tragic in the truest sense. These stories are about children who lost their parents and relatives, homes, and an entire way of life. Some were strafed by low flying fighters on the way home from school, and a number saw or heard women, sometimes relatives, being raped by Russian soldiers. Most endured the elements and were hungry more often than not.  These stories are about kids who survived the war with only the clothes they wore, viewed in the areas where they ended up as refugee riffraff.<br />Why read such a book?  Perhaps, the answer is to learn more about the experience of other human beings, in a time not so distant, who were on the losing end of the war. Also, everything is not as unambiguous as one might think. For example, a number of those who were German children then report that Russian soldiers who raped women were ironically, generally kind to children, \\"even generous at times, sharing the little they had.\\" One man even said he forgave the Russians who raped his mother, that it was their leaders who encouraged them to take revenge on the Germans. Other surprising information of a lighter nature in this book is that many Russians learned to speak German relatively quickly, and even low-ranking soldiers showed a remarkable language aptitude.<br />One comes away from this book recognizing the strength of character and resourcefulness of these people. Most give credit to the mothers who guided and saved them while their fathers were away fighting and dying in the war. They talk about how their families worked as a team under the mother's leadership, to survive. A number said that they thought of their fathers only as photographs. Surprisingly, few of them had much bitterness about what they endured. Courage and discipline was the rule among them, and it served them well in surviving. Many experienced all the adversity that one can imagine. Those of us who think we have endured difficulty in life may change our minds after reading this book. Wolfgang Samuel's accomplishment in compiling these stories is enormous and worthy of the utmost respect.	2002-10-25

But in this book Simon Winchester describes the historical context of William Smith's work in detail, with scholarship and wit. <br />Works about the history of science are sometimes as revealing about culture as about science. Consider the nature of an English society in the seventeenth century which committed Smith to debtor's prison. Also, the influence of upper class gentlemen blocked Smith's admission to the newly organized Geological Society on the grounds that he was not the right sort.  They then sought to take credit for his work themselves. Yet Smith lived at a time when science did not belong entirely to academicians or other organizations and could be advanced by the work of a single, persistent individual, such as himself.<br />During Smith's early lifetime, a contradiction existed between scriptural interpretation  of  the earth's age and the fossil evidence that was being found across England. The Bishop of Usher had pronounced the age of the earth as 4004 years old, but people were finding a plethora of fossils that seemed to show otherwise. Slowly it was accepted through the work of Smith and others that the fossils represented extinct life from the different ages of the history of the earth. Smith determined that the existence of particular fossils in strata could be used to identify their relating to the surrounding strata. In Smith's lifetime, coal, a fossil fuel, provided most of the industrial energy of the day. It was locating coal deposits that first drove Smith's work although later he began to see the larger picture and to focus on the work that became the foundation of modern geology.<br />Simon Winchester's writing flows smoothly and perceptively as he traces Smith's lifelong struggle to convey the message of his empirical observations and to receive credit for that work. Winchester also includes interesting asides, such as that one of the debtors prisons was called \\"The Clink\\", hence the origin of the expression about getting thrown in it. Although the subject of this book is one which I had already found interesting, Simon Winchester's book increased my interest. Winchester, a man who seems to enjoy his work, has demonstrated excellent and graceful writing skills here, and I look forward to reading some of his other books.	2002-10-22

To me, wine, climate, geography, and culture are interrelated. I have traveled several times to Austria over the last few years. However, I cannot say that I have had a good glass or bottle of wine there. Reading this book makes clearer why.  The primary wine production is in the eastern part of the country, where I have traveled mainly in the west.<br />Mr. Blom writes that Austria has three main wine regions: the area along the Danube, west of Vienna, the state of Burgenland, and the eastern part of the state of Steiermark. The most commonly grown wine grape is Gruener Weltliner, a white grape which makes up 37% of Austria's total wine production. This grape is thought to have been grown in the Danube region in Roman times. Second is Welschriesling, another white grape, which makes up 10% of Austria's grape harvest. Mueller-Thurgau, a white that, unlike the other two, is also widely grown in Germany, ties for third at about 8% with Zweigelt, the most widely cultivated red wine in Austria.<br />One of the features I like most about this book is the detailed maps of the wine regions of Austria. For example, on the map of the Wachau region along the Danube, there are 109 vineyards identified by numeric key with their locations shown in regard to the river and the towns along it, such as Duernstein on the north bank, where Richard the Lion-hearted was held for ransom during the Crusades.<br />Mr. Blom's book also discusses the wine growing areas and the top growers in each of them. The book describes the characteristics of each estate and its specialties. Blom also provides phone and fax numbers, as well as addresses.<br />Any book about Austrian wine worthy of the name could not fail to mention the well known Austrian institution of the Heurige. The term comes from a German word meaning new wine. However, the word has come to refer to the small inns that serve wine, located around wine growing areas on the outskirts of towns.  As Blom points out, the public is notified as to the availability of new wine by fir trees hung above the door of the inn. This custom is thought to go back to the time of Charlemagne.  <br />The next time I go to Austria I will be a little better prepared to appreciate the good wines that are produced there. Hopefully, it will not be too long.	2002-10-10
US	42494427	R103Y953U1MWEC	0807827061	269189773	GIs and Fräuleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany	Books	4	14	16	N	Y	Amis and Veronikas	\\"GIs and Fraeuleins\\"<BR>Maria Hoehn<BR>ISBN 0-8078-5375-5<br />This book explores the culture clash that occurred during the Cold War in the 1950's when American GIs were first stationed in large numbers in the towns of Baumholder and Kaiserslautern in the rural Rhineland-Palatinate state of Germany, between the Rhine and Mosel rivers.  Having served in Germany a decade later, I was surprised at the extent to which there had been such problems. In Mannheim, most of the issues that Maria Hoehn describes were not readily apparent. But Mannheim was urban versus the relatively provincial character of Baumholder and Kaiserlautern of the previous decade.<br />Some of Hoehn's themes in this book include the impact the American soldier's money and lifestyle on rural German society, the German conservatives' attempt to punish German women who associated with GIs, especially black GIs, and the irony of the Germans' rejection of discrimination against Jews in the new Federal democracy vis-à-vis their acceptance of it against black American soldiers. Certainly, Hoehn points out, white attitudes toward fellow black soldiers played a role in the German view. <br />Hoehn's documentation from publications of the time convincingly demonstrates that there were significant racial problems and that many Germans vehemently opposed intimate associations between German women and American blacks, so much so that the conservative CDU political party and various religious organizations tried to have these women legally classified as prostitutes.<br />Hoehn writes that many Germans including those who had lost ancestral lands to American military installations began to cash in on the boom by renting rooms to Americans. Barns and attics were transformed into apartments. German families moved into their own kitchens to be able rent out the rest of the house to the Americans who were willing to pay four or five times the going rate.  Hoehn quips that in the small towns where everyone usually kept animals that some Germans had to choose between having a pig or an American, an \\"Ami\\" in the German parlance of the time. <br />Due to high unemployment throughout Germany at this time, many young women came to the area hoping for a job as a maid for an American family, a waitress, or a dancer at an establishment that catered to American soldiers. Many, who had lost homes and parents during the war, hoped to escape from a life of poverty. Some were refugees from the former territories or East Germany. These women did not find favor in the traditional view of the residents of the area for their fraternization with American soldiers, especially black American soldiers. Such women were dubbed \\"Veronikas\\".  A number of them were arrested and subjected to humiliating trials in local courts by extremist judges. Efforts for national legislation classifying these women as prostitutes by the coalition of CDU, Protestant, and Catholic leaders ultimately failed.<br />This book is an excellent, well-documented piece of research. Although Hoehn's writing is somewhat academic and redundant in places, this is a commendable book of considerable merit. Those interested in postwar German history and even some former GIs may get new insight from it.	2002-09-08

The locals never missed a day throughout the war. They baked cakes, fried chickens, made sandwiches, and poured glasses of milk. Young ladies danced with the soldiers. High school girls' names and addresses were placed in popcorn balls for the soldiers to find, so the soldiers could write to them.<br />Despite the fact that the train stops were no more than twenty minutes, soldiers who were located over fifty years later and interviewed, seventy and eighty year old men, often were reduced to tears remembering the kindness with which they were treated by the people at the North Platte Canteen. <br />Many of the soldiers, eighteen or nineteen years old, were away from home for the first time. They faced uncertain futures, with little life experience on which to draw. From my Vietnam era experience, I know that they were afraid and that the thought of what lay ahead of them seldom left their consciousness. <br />This book has some of the feel of \\"The Greatest Generation\\". It is hard to remember the American society of those days, how little people had and how little they expected. It is good to be reminded of a time when people did something for someone else because they thought it was the right thing to do. The people who worked at the canteen knew that many of the soldiers they met would never return home, and these people were determined to do something for them. <br />When the canteen closed at war's end, the administrative committee declined to spend any of the funds that had been collected, for a memorial to the canteen. A memorial was fine they thought, but not with money that had been raised for the soldiers. The remaining balance was donatedto VA hospitals that were taking care of wounded veterans.<br />Author Bob Green, who visited North Platte to examine local records and to interview, writes that the old railroad depot that was used as the canteen was torn down some years ago. All that remains of the canteen, that became famous among servicemen during the war, are old city records, newspaper clippings from a defunct newspaper, the memories of the folks who worked there, and those of the surviving servicemen who visited. <br />If there is a message in this book, it is, perhaps, that, through the canteen worker's efforts for the soldiers, these good people found their finest hour.	2002-08-09

It is a good follow-up to \\"The German Way\\". Sometimes writers of travel books try to provide insights that turn out to be misleading. Mr. Flippo, however, is neither travel writer nor dilettante and seems to know Germany well. <br />The book begins with a series of questions to test one's knowledge of things German. Despite having once lived in Germany, having traveled there several times recently, and being particularly interested in the German language and culture, out of the first ten questions, I could answer only three correctly. <br />The German washing machine is a case in point. Any American who has ever tried to do laundry at a German laundromat has discovered differences in the process. For starters, there hardly are any German laundromats. Next, a German washing machine may have a two-hour wash cycle, it uses hotter water, since it heats its own, and it spins the laundry to a near dry state. <br />Regarding the German language, Mr. Flippo cites a number of English sounding words commonly in use that Germans think are English words, which are not. A couple of examples are \\"die Basecap\\" which means \\"baseball cap\\", and \\"der Talkmaster\\", which refers to a \\"talk show host\\".<br />Flippo touches on other \\"Germanisms\\" which I have encountered. One is the idea that drinking tap water is unhealthy and should be avoided. A waitress I encountered in Austria explained that although it was okay for Americans to drink tap water that it was not good for Germans and Austrians. Germans tend to drink bottled mineral water, and asking for tap water, \\"das Leitungswasser\\", will not uncommonly be regarded as fairly strange behavior.<br />Another useful thing to know is that credit cards are not as universally accepted as they are in the U.S. Flippo warns that is best to never assume that arestaurant will accept your credit card. The same is true for smaller hotels and accommodations. As evidence, Flippo points out that although France has a population of about 58 million and Germany 82 million, 250,000 less locations in Germany accept credit cards.<br />One of the most entertaining chapters in the book is about household garbage in Germany.  One is not allowed to simply put anything in one's garbage can. There are strict local rules for the separation of the various types of waste. Glass waste is not to be mixed with biodegradable waste, for example. Break the rules, and your garbage does not get picked up. By the way, the garbage disposal is not to be found in Germany, and it is in fact illegal, due to pollution considerations.<br />Despite previous familiarity with Germany, I acquired new information from this book and very much enjoyed reading it. Hopefully, in the future, Hyde Flippo will tell me some more that I do not know about the German-speaking world.	2002-07-22

A picture on a historical marker showed a once relatively large town that had had many houses and facilities. We were both struck by there being a cemetery with no surviving town. Later, when, during a web search, I came across Toby Smith's book about Dawson. I ordered it.<br />With a relatively obscure subject, this is a book not likely to be widely read, and that is a shame. Because the book that Toby Smith has written is a remarkable one. Through extensive interviewing, he has reconstructed the vanished homes and buildings of Dawson, re-populated them with departed generations of citizens, and breathed life back into what was once a dynamic coal mining community. <br />There are photos in the book that depict, among other things, the bodies of miners in caskets after a 1923 mining explosion, the proud 1937 football team that shared the state championship, and a 1941 photo of a smiling GI on furlough with his brother and sisters. Apart from the pictures, Mr. Smith tells stories about and gives impressions of many of the townsfolk. What Edgar Lee Masters did for the people in the fictional Spoon River cemetery, Smith has done for the former inhabitants of Dawson.<br />Our vacation walk through the Dawson cemetery revealed that many of the coalminers were from other countries. One section contains graves of over two hundred men, mostly Italians, who were killed in a disastrous mine explosion in 1913. Other nationalities represented in Dawson were Yugoslavs, Japanese, Finns, French, Swedes, and Mexicans. <br />The Phelps Dodge Company that owned the mines and the entire town, in many regards, engaged in enlightened management. For example, it had an anti-discrimination policy for employees of all nationalities and races, including blacks. After the 1913 tragedy, Smith writes that the company \\"did not lookat the tragedy in terms of lost earnings.\\" To its credit, each widow was given $1000, each miner's child $200, and the family of each bachelor $500, large amounts for that time. On the other hand, the company remained a staunch holdout for years in recognizing the miners' union.<br />In 1950, with coal demand having steadily declined from the heyday of the coal-burning, steam engine, Phelps Dodge closed Dawson's last mine. As it owned all the buildings and houses, the town was simply shut down. Everyone left, and the buildings and equipment were sold off.  Dawson, unlike other defunct mining towns, though, for over fifty years has refused to die. A visitor to the cemetery can see that it is still kept up, and every other year, former residents gather on the town site to have a picnic and to reminisce. <br />There is something about the universal human struggle in this story of Dawson, and Toby Smith has written a fine book about it.	2002-07-19

Etulain, Editor<BR>ISBN 0-8263-2433-9<br />This book offers eleven chapters by different authors on various personalities in the history of what is now the state of New Mexico. The most interesting to me are about Tony Hillerman, Mabel Dodge Luhan, Pope and Wendell Chino.<br />Two of the least interesting chapters are about Billy the Kid and Kit Carson. Kathleen P. Chamberlain tells us that at least 250 books and hundreds of articles have been written about Billy the Kid, a part of a \\"search for a romantic old West that never existed.\\" Barton H. Barbour describes the \\"powerful resonance\\" of Kit Carson's mythic life. In other words, the reputations of these men have as much to do with fiction as fact.<br />A lesser-known subject is Wendell Chino. Through Mr. Chino's leadership, the Mescalero Apaches have, perhaps, been the most successful tribe in New Mexico at becoming financially independent through the development of their gambling casino and Ski Apache resort area.<br />Pope was an Indian from San Juan Pueblo, who organized the revolt of 1680. Joe S. Sando, who wrote this chapter, describes this revolt as the original American revolution. It is difficult not too sympathize with the Pueblos in their rebellion against the Spanish conquerors who set about destroying everything these people held dear and exploiting them for Spain's purposes. Pope, it would appear, was a legitimate Indian hero.<br />Lois Palken Rudnick's chapter about Mabel Dodge Luhan is interesting. Luhan had already had several previous lives of wealth and glamour in Europe and New York prior to showing up in New Mexico. In 1918, she began an affair with Tony Lujan of Taos Pueblo, to whom she was ultimately married for thirty nine years. In Taos Pueblo, Luhan discovered a community that was a model of permanence and stability, where individual, social, artistic, and religious values were completely integrated in a way that she had not previously known. Ultimately,Luhan played a key role in promoting modern art in New Mexico and the work of people such as Andrew Dassburg, Ansel Adams, D. H. Lawrence, Georgia O'Keefe, and Frank Waters.<br />In the chapter on Tony Hillerman, Ferenc M. Szasz does a good job of characterizing the author's accomplishments. Hillerman, born in Oklahoma, has become a major New Mexico phenomenon as well as a literary voice for the Navajo and the American southwest in general. Szasz explains that Hillerman's themes in his sixteen novels  include the following: the nuclear world and the cold war,  southwestern anthropology and western history, Indian gaming, alcohol abuse, hantavirus, Indian education, and, in particular, the Navajo view of these things. Hillerman's writing, as it turns out, complements well the state's multi-million dollar tourism industry, said to employ 60,000 New Mexicans. It has been suggested that Hillerman's novels have brought more tourists to New Mexico than any other single source.<br />On the whole, for those interested in New Mexico, Richard Etulain has brought together some appealing reading.	2002-07-07

It is not without facts about engine model numbers and wheel configurations, but more importantly it also brings back the feel of the glory days of one of the most famous railroads in American history. My interest is more in the latter. My dad worked for the Santa Fe as a switchman. My family was a railroad family. At night, we heard the boxcars being banged together in yards not far from our house. I can remember standing on the front porch, as a small boy, to watch the \\"Texas Chief\\" approach.<br />A particularly interesting chapter in this book deals with Fred Harvey's remarkable success in his food service business with the Santa Fe Railroad. Prior to Harvey, food at railroad restaurants was notoriously bad. In 1876, Harvey approached the Santa Fe. He was given a try. He succeeded by providing fine meals and service at his first location in Topeka. The Santa Fe asked him to open more restaurants at train stations further west. Within a few years, he had branched off into building hotels for railroad employees, but eventually for the general public. His restaurants and hotels went from Kansas to California. One of Harvey's most popular hotels was at the Grand Canyon. Harvey's restaurants were staffed by attractive young women of good character relocated from the East to work in his establishments. The \\"Harvey Girls\\" lived in supervised dormitories he provided.  Ultimately, Harvey relocated over 5,000 young women. Many of whom married and remained in the West. When the Santa Fe started providing dining cars on its trains in the 1890's, Harvey received a contract for that as well. The book has a photograph of a dining car menu from the 1960's that is certainly nostalgic to read.<br />Railroading was an extremely competitive business, about which one could draw parallels to the present day computer industry. For one thing, railroads were about technology. The railroad that had the fastest and most powerful locomotives had a competitive business advantage over the others. As with computer companies, no advantage held up for long. The Santa Fe was constantly innovating, such as when it began trying out diesel locomotives. The Santa Fe was not above employing technological stunts to get publicity, such as when in 1905 it accepted a challenge to get a train from Los Angeles to Chicago in 46 hours. The three-car, so-called \\"Coyote Special\\" made it under 45 hours. Railroads, also like computer companies, often sought to acquire other railroads, the ultimate fate of the Santa Fe when acquired by the Burlington Northern in 1996. But the Santa Fe ran for over a hundred years.<br />This book brought back a lot of good memories for me. It may for others as well.	2002-06-28

Last year, while browsing in a bookstore in a medieval town in Germany, I came across a German language edition of one of Hillerman's books. <br />To those whose primary interest in Hillerman's work relates to his use of the Navajo culture in his stories, \\"The Wailing Wind\\" does not disappoint. In this book, as an example, one finds that Officer Bernadette Manuelito's adherence to the Navajo belief of avoiding contact with the dead leads her to blunder in an investigation. But she re-establishes her credibility by using information from her uncle, who is a shaman with a unique knowledge of native plants.<br />It is interesting how Hillerman constructs the characters of Chee and Leaphorn. Both men are effective policemen, but they are very different men. Chee is younger, more impetuous, more error-prone, and less sure of himself.  In one passage, Chee pretends to study the menu carefully in the Navajo Inn, to preserve his pride, because in the end he always orders a hamburger. Chee is also more a traditional Navajo than Leaphorn, who has earned a master's degree in Anthropology at Arizona State University.  But Chee, who has studied with his uncle to become a chaman in earlier books uses that knowledge here to predict a suspect's likely behavior. Leaphorn is older, retired, more self-confident, steadier, and exhibits the deductive reasoning powers of a Navajo Sherlock Holmes. For example, when Chee is giving Leaphorn some information about a crime, he notes that one never has to explain the ramifications of a set of circumstances to Leaphorn. He always sees them.  <BR> <BR>Those who have followed the vicissitudes of Jim Chee's love life through several novels, with two earlier girlfriends, may take interest inthe emergence in this book of Bernadette Manuelito as his new, would-be love interest. Leaphorn, the Legendary Lieutenant, on the other hand, remains aloof. His friendship with Professor Louisa Bourbonette seems destined to stay platonic. Leaphorn still remembers little things about his Navajo wife who died some years before.<br />In \\"The Wailing Wind\\", Hillerman, as always, utilizes his considerable skill in constructing a plot of seemingly unrelated, intriguing threads of events that he adroitly weaves together at the end. This book features a lost gold mine, a beautiful, vanished wife, a Halloween story of the supernatural, and two murders. The construction of this plot is certainly the equal of most in Hillerman's books, though its resolution is probably not the equal of his best. In the conclusion, Leaphorn seems to make some uncharacteristic mistakes. But it is good to read about Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee again. This book takes one further into the development of these well-drawn characters, and about such characters one always wants to read more.	2002-05-27
US	42494427	R3RFKMFMRKPDAL	0789205777	460961409	German Wine Guide	Books	5	13	13	N	Y	The Wines of Germany	\\"German Wine Guide\\"<BR>Armin Diel and Joel Payne<BR>ISBN 0-7892-0577-7<br />This book with the unassuming title is an encyclopedia of German wines. It has no pictures of scenery or vineyards. But it has photos of a number of German wine producers, an unusual touch, some of their labels, and some of their wine advertisements. This is a very serious wine book.  It is not so much a book to be read as much as one to be studied. Most of it consists of ratings and listings of wines region by region in a highly systematic manner. One of the authors of this book, Armin Diel is a wine producer in Germany himself. In the past, I have enjoyed a bottle of wine from his estate in the Nahe wine region and read a little about the wines produced there.<br />Although I have no serious expertise on German wines - this book re-assured me of that - over the years I have tried wine in about half of the thirteen wine regions described in this book and tasted wine from others. The mention of the names of  familiar towns and wines in Germany made this book interesting for me. Someone who is unfamiliar with Germany and these regions might grow tired of reading the lists of wine produced by various estates in them. In other words, this is probably not the right book for a person beginning to learn about German wines. It seems to me that it is more for someone who already knows something about them.<br />The authors give the prices, in marks, of the wines in this book, and some might be surprised to learn that a nice bottle of wine, including some of those listed here, can be had in Germany for as little as a few dollars. Another surprise is that there is even information in this book about two not too well known wine regions in the former East Germany, Saale-Unstrut and Sachsen, although they are apparently as yet not highly regarded.<br />One disappointment about this book, no fault of the authors, is that a good deal of what one reads about in it is not widely available in the United States. This is like reading an appealing menu without being able to order. Even in cities like Austin where I live, a good selection of German wines is difficult to come by. <br />As suggested earlier, it would be difficult to describe this book as \\"a read\\", but it is an excellent reference. The next time I go to Germany, along with my German dictionary, I intend to take this book. Prost!	2002-04-11
US	42494427	R26LS40LWMOPFF	0316121568	330371400	Leaving a Trace: On Keeping a Journal	Books	5	22	22	N	N	A Basis of Creative Activity	\\"Leaving a Trace\\"<BR>Alexandra Johnson<BR>ISBN 0-316-12156-8<br />For those of us who have used our journal entries as the basis for writing, this book is apropos. Alexandra Johnson and others teach courses about journal and diary writing as the basis of creative activity. It was news to me that there are such courses. One of the keys to productive journal writing, according to the author, is to realize that journal entries need not only be about interesting places or unusual events. The everyday can be the source of material as well. As the author writes, \\"Life is in the details.\\" It is interesting that many older people wish to achieve an understanding of their lives by writing about them in journals or diaries. <br />I suppose the most helpful thing that one learns from this book is to approach journal writing less formally. One does not have to be constrained to write everything in a commercially produced diary or to try to write only profound things. It took Frank McCourt, the author of \\"Angela's Ashes\\", years to realize that writing about the poverty of his early life could be literature.<br />Unconsciously, I had made some of the observations Alexandra Johnson makes, but I had not come to understand them as she does. For example, my father had written a diary when he was about twenty-one years old. Even though, he lived to be fifty-six, I had always regarded this diary as his best legacy. When an uncle of mine died, I asked for any journal that he might have kept. Eventually I came into possession of a number of letters that he had written to his parents when he was a soldier in WWII from Germany, France, Panama, and the Philippine Islands. So in a way, these letters formed the basis of a non-traditional kind of journal. <br />All in all, \\"Leaving a Trace\\" is interesting reading. I looked forward to picking it up each evening before falling asleep, my favorite reading. I was even inspired to write in the journal that I had not touched in over a year.<br />Johnson's primary message would seem to be that recording our lives does matter. Doing so is a way of coming to terms with them and a leaving of something of  oneself  behind.  The key is to simply write about one's life, interests, and observations. Recently, I have had the opportunity to help my mother-in-law record the details of her terrible ordeal of being a refugee in World War II. It has been surprising to me how excited this project has made her. After almost sixty years, she had perhaps never entirely comprehended or understood these events. Somehow having someone help her write about them seemed to help facilitate this.<br />For those who have thought about getting started with a journal or writing one better, this book would be a good place to begin.	2002-03-27
US	42494427	RMMNION72TNAV	0521368367	235523736	A Concise History of Germany (Cambridge Concise Histories)	Books	4	36	38	N	N	Germany History in a Nutshell	\\"A Concise History of Germany\\" <BR>Mary Fulbrook<BR>ISBN 0-521-36836-7<br />I was interested in reading this book to get insight about places I had visited in Germany and hopefully about some I would see in the future.<br />Mary Fulbrook states that a history of Germany, a country which has not existed as such for so many years, is really a history of the German speaking peoples. Indeed, the history of Germany has been long, complex, and often influenced by war. <br />There was some of the insight that I sought in this book, for example, in the section, \\"The German Peasant's War\\". I had come across references to this conflict a few times in Germany.  Fulbrook writes that by 1525, there were 300,000 peasants in armed revolt in German speaking areas. Over 100,000 were ultimately killed when the rebellions were put down. There had been other related rebellions preceding this war in the previous half century, she writes.<br />The Thirty Years War, from 1618 to 1648, was another conflict, described by the author, that I have seen references to in Germany in association with cities of Rothenburg, Noerdlingen, Heidelberg, and Seligenstadt among others. <br />Another part of this book that I found interesting was the account of the Weimar Republic. It lasted a little over fourteen years. In the end, large numbers of Germans from the left and right rejected democracy as a form of government.  This government failed for a number of reasons. Some related to harsh peace terms after WWI and an unstable economy. The depression in the United States and the cancellation of short-term loans also played a hand.<br /> The most well known part of German history to the reader would seem to be the Nazi times that led up to WWII and led Germany to destruction. The coverage of this aspect of German history is well-trod ground. The description of the era in this book is interesting, but it does not particularly provide fresh insight.<br />One of the more interesting parts of the book is thefavorable comparison of certain aspects of the old East Germany with West Germany. While the latter became economically prosperous and closely aligned with the West, East Germany became the most productive satellite in the communist bloc and one of the USSR's most reliable supporters. Surprisingly, Fulbrook writes also that there was greater social mobility in East Germany with a school system that emphasized work experience. She states that East Germany had a \\"range of routes\\" to higher education, so that those who did not take the academic route through upper school could still access higher education. The price to be paid, however, was political conformism.<br />On the whole, the author of \\"A Concise History of Germany\\" accomplishes a difficult feat, which is to write a short book on a subject which is long, covering hundreds of  years,  and complex. While it is true that the focus of the book is very high-level and often oversimplified, it provides for consumption in smaller doses what otherwise might not be digested at all by readers if available only in unappetizingly larger amounts.	2002-03-17
US	42494427	R23YNRVBCUJXY0	192890114X	388417570	Karen Brown's Austria: Charming Inns & Itineraries 2002	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Charming but Expensive	\\"Karen Brown's Austria --Charming Inns and Itineraries\\"<BR>Karen Brown<BR>ISBN 1-928901-14-X<br />I enjoyed reading this book since I have visited Austria on vacation several times in the last few years. The coverage of the various Austrian states in the section of the book titled \\"Itineraries\\" is somewhat opinionated but informative. In general the coverage of Austria in Mrs. Brown's book is much more comprehensive than some. I found the parts about the southern state of Kaernten and eastern state of Burgenland helpful since I knew less about those areas than most of the others.<br />Regarding areas more familiar to me, this book was generally consistent with my own impressions. For example, the Salzkammergut region near Salzburg is a beautiful region of lakes, mountains, and picturesque towns, such as Sankt Wolfgang. A short distance south is the tiny town of Hallstatt, which, it is true, has one of the most beautiful natural settings anywhere. <br />There are some misconceptions in this book that I would point out to anyone who might use it for planning purposes. The author's statement that in Austria \\"You can eat anywhere, anytime\\" is not generally accurate. The restaurants, as well as many other businesses in the small towns which make up Austria, have limited hours. One has to plan around them.<br />I would also disagree that in Austria \\"it is rare to be behind a line of cars or a stream of slow-moving trucks.\\" Last year, my wife and were stuck in very heavy traffic about twenty miles south of Salzburg on Autobahn 10. It was completely stopped for five minutes at a time and moving only very slowly the rest. We lost over an hour. We have had similar experiences elsewhere in Austria. The reason for these delays is ongoing road repair. <br />This book also gives the impression that accommodations in Austria are relatively expensive. Although the title refers to charming \\"Inns\\", in the text the accommodations are found in the \\"Hotels\\" section. Hotels in Austria are often expensive, but there are other very nice, less-costly options available.<br />The fact of the matter is that Austria is rich in charming and inexpensive accommodations. In this country, they would be called \\"Bed and Breakfasts\\". The best way to find and book them is on the Internet. Austria has some excellent web sites. Look for vacation apartments, rooms, and farmhouses. Information is available in English. Many places have photos, descriptions, and prices. Most often, they have e-mail and accept reservations for the asking without a deposit. <br />Last year, my wife and I spent two nights in a beautiful 900 year-old farmhouse at Sankt Wolfgang in a double room with kitchen and private bath for about twenty dollars a night less than the least expensive place on Karen Brown's list. The room was in perfect condition, as well as tastefully furnished and decorated. In short, despite some good descriptions of interesting aspects of Austria, I believe Karen Brown's book really does not do justice to affordable vacationing in Austria.	2002-03-06
US	42494427	R3TLD8KW84C7JB	0684847957	933865696	Wait Till Next Year - A Memoir	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Growing Up with the Brooklyn  Dodgers	\\"Wait Till Next Year\\"<BR>Doris Kearns Goodwin<BR>ISBN 0-684-84795-7<br />This memoir of Doris Kearns Goodwin's childhood on Long Island brings back memories of growing up the 1950's. She tells how all the neighbors in her subdivision knew one another, how their children played together through all the houses, and how the first neighbor to get a television set in 1946 invited all the others over to watch, at a time when there were only 7,000 sets in the entire country. Mrs. Goodwin's story of following the ill-starred Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team along with her family and most of her community of Rockville Center evokes a melancholy for an America that slipped imperceptibly away from those of us who lived through the time. <br /> I long ago ceased to care about major league baseball and the millionaires who play it. They go where the money is, but the players of the fifties mainly stayed with the same team for most of their careers. Reading the names of the 1950's Brooklyn lineups in this book -- names like Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Don Newcombe, Duke Snyder, Preacher Roe, and Johnny Podres - re-acquainted me with my long lost knowledge of the teams and players of those days. <br />It was charming to read about how the young Doris Kearns schemed to break Gil Hodges out of a hitting slump one year by giving him her St. Christopher's medal and how much she treasured a long-sought autograph finally obtained from Jackie Robinson, major league baseball's first black player. <br />The portraits that Mrs. Goodwin paints of her mother, who died when the author was fifteen, and her father are created with fine strokes. Her frail mother taught her to respect people, such as a poor, elderly Ukrainian woman in a rundown house whom the neighborhood children thought was a witch. Her father gave her a guide for the struggles of life through a love of baseball and loyalty to the long-suffering Dodgers.<br /> From 1941 through 1953, six times the Dodgers won the National League championship and six times they faced the New York Yankees in the World Series and lost. But in 1955, the Brooklyn Dodgers played the Yankees a final time in the Series and won, four games to three. In a fifteen-minute period that followed the game more phone calls were made in the immediate area than at any time since VJ day. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange pretty much came to a standstill. Thousands of people converged on Brooklyn to dance in the streets.<br />The headline the next morning in \\"The New York Daily News\\", with a twist on the hopeful slogan that had been the watchword of Dodger fans for years, read, \\"This is Next Year!\\"<br />It is fitting that Mrs. Goodwin, a well-known presidential historian, endowed her own sons with a love of the game of baseball. After all, one of the better things that one learns from sports, as this book affirms, is to take pride in the accomplishments of the past and to look forward optimistically to the future.	2002-02-18

For the most part, it must be reached by foot. To those who are in reasonably good shape and can rough it a little, though, this book provides the insight to partake of that Alpine world in all its glory.<br />Having visited Austria on several occasions and ridden by cable car near the tops of mountains such as the Kitzbuehler Horn and Grossglockner, I have glimpsed from up there the pale blue-white mountain peaks that lead off almost endlessly to the distant horizon. But to have the opportunity to walk for days in those mountains, spending the nights in mountain lodges built just for hikers, that would be a fine experience.<br />These mountain huts are probably unfamiliar even to those who are fairly familiar with Austria. These huts, Mr. Hurdle explains, are not shacks, but they are professionally run, clean, and comfortable mountain lodges, where hikers sleep on long mattresses in communal areas for as many as twenty persons at a time without regard to sex or age. Sometimes food is available, as well as wine and beer. Hut guests have also been known to sing. Altogether, there are about 900 such places in the mountains of Germany and Austria.<br />The book describes eleven different tours of from four to eleven days.  The hikes are mostly in the southern part of Austria where it borders with Italy. The hikes include tours in the Oeztaler Alpen, where the famous ice-age man, that Austrians call \\"Oetzi\\" was found, as well as a hike on Grossglocker, the highest mountain in Austria. There is a map for each tour, and a description including the appropriate hut in which to sleep for each stage.<br />This is an interesting book, but perhaps it loses a little by focusing almost entirely on the details of the hikes. The general reader might hope for a slightly broader context that included a little more detail about the towns or areas near the starting or ending points of some of the tours. It is somewhat difficult, even for one familiar with Austria, to get ones bearings in terms of the familiar towns and highways of the country. One other shortcoming in this book is that the pictures are all in black and white. Color would have enormously increased the degree to which the beauty of the mountains is conveyed.<br />On the whole, the book sparked my interest, and I hope, before long, to walk in the beauty of some of those high remote places.tly broader context that included a little more detail about the towns or areas near the starting or ending points of some of the tours.

US	42494427	R2V5P52V4LDDO3	0844225134	610641279	The German Way : Aspects of Behavior, Attitudes, and Customs in the German-Speaking World	Books	4	68	72	N	N	Insights into the German-speaking World	\\"The German Way\\"<BR>Hyde Flippo<BR>ISBN 0-8442-2513-4<br />\\"The German Way\\" is quite an interesting little book. Having lived in Germany and traveled in Austria, and, to a lesser extent, Switzerland, there were numerous items of information in this book that were unknown to me. For example, although I have visited almost every province in Austria from the shore of the Bodensee in the west to Vienna in the east, I did not know that Austria was eighty-five percent Catholic.<br />I was vaguely aware that Germans use eating implements differently than Americans do. I have occasionally eaten a sandwich with a knife and fork in a \\"Gasthaus\\".  However, I did not realize the extent to which handling table implements is a differentiator between Germans and Americans. For example, my wife pointed out to me in discussing this part of the book that one of our German friends, who has lived in the U.S. for seven or eight years, uses a modified German style of handling silverware.<br />It was also surprising to read that only fifteen percent of the movies Germans watch are from Germany. This may explain why many of the German movies available to be rented in the U.S., even from specialty houses, are usually older ones.<br />It was a total surprise to me that the local office of vital statistics has to review the names given to babies in Germany to ensure that the name must not endanger the child and that it reflects the child's sex. The latter rule, maybe the first, would have made short shrift of \\"A Boy Named Sue\\".<br />One point about the German language that Hyde Flippo appears to oversimplify somewhat is the idea that \\"Hoch Deutsch\\" originated from the way the language was spoken in the northern part of Germany. A recent article in a German language magazine I read stated that German, Austria, and Switzerland each has its own \\"Hoch Deutsch\\".<br />One shortcoming I found in this book is that some of the information seems a little dated. For example, although Europeans have beentransitioning to the euro for several years, marks and schillings are discussed as though they will be used indefinitely when, in fact, they have already gone out of circulation. Another example relates to a discussion of the Austrian Freedom Party of Jorg Haider being unable to form a coalition with another party at the national level. Well, unfortunately, the \\"Freiheit Partei Oesterreich\\" did form such a coalition some time ago. It led to international sanctions against Austria.<br />On the whole, I found this book interesting and acquired some new insights about the German-speaking world from it. Business people or tourists planning to go to Germany, Austria, or Switzerland could well benefit from reading this book.	2002-01-21

Like those folks, the Navajo cultural stuff is what interests me. Well, maybe there is something more than that. It is Tony Hillerman's remarkable ability to tell a story. <br />Hillerman grew up in Oklahoma, the son of poor parents for whom he had much respect. The title of his memoir comes from something his mother used to say, that one who did not expect too much from life was seldom disappointed. This was an outlook not uncommon to Hillerman's generation. Also, like many young men of his generation, he went off to the war in Europe. <br />As a combat infantryman, Hillerman won the silver star, the bronze star, and got blown-up by a mine. Yet there is little bitterness in him about the war. This is one of the few memoirs relating to WWII in which a former soldier describes the opposing German soldiers as \\"other teenagers\\". The casual manner in which Hillerman writes about his war experiences and later about his literary success seems to reflect a stoic outlook about \\"that short run toward the Last Great Adventure\\".<br />After the war, a couple of years studying journalism at the University of Oklahoma led to work as a reporter in Texas, Oklahoma, and eventually New Mexico. Fifteen years of newspaper work and being editor of the Albuquerque paper led to some connections with the University of New Mexico and its journalism department. Hillerman taught there for about fifteen years until he lost his enthusiasm for teaching and wanted to write.<br />Hillerman learned the Navajo culture from Navaho acquaintances who sensed his sincere interest. Having attended eight grades at an Indian school in Oklahoma and having had Indian playmates helped put him at ease with the people. He came to understand the Navajo ceremonies and values, which he made use of in his stories. For authentic and respectful portrayal of Navajo (Dineh) culture in his books, the tribe declared him \\"Special Friend of the Dineh\\".<br />In this memoir, one learns the origin of some of the material in Hillerman's books. For example, one of his villains is based in part on a death row killer who asked Hillerman and the Santa Fe AP bureau chief to write about him so that his mother might claim his body. It seems that he had been abandoned as a child by his mother and did not know her whereabouts.<br />Hillerman's \\"breakout book\\", my favorite, came in 1988 with the publication of \\"Thief of Time\\", about the theft of artifacts from Indian ruins for sale to collectors. It was his first book to make the \\"New York Times\\" bestseller list, and doing that, Hillerman explains, guarantees an author very large sales due to the way it is used by bookstore managers for ordering books.<br />At the end of this memoir, Hillerman reflects back positively on seventy five years of life. \\"They've been far better than anyone deserves\\", he writes. <br />By the way, Hillerman says that he interrupted a Navajo police novel to complete this memoir. I am looking forward to it.	2002-01-08

When Tom Brokaw characterized Rooney's WWII age group as &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;, Rooney wrote that it was probably no more special than the current generation, which had not found the occasion for identifying the same qualities in itself. Mr. Brokaw, however, has written the foreword of &quot;My War&quot; and speaks there of Andy Rooney's book as a gift to those who did not come home. <br />This book is the best work I have read by Andy Rooney. I admire Mr. Rooney's self-effacing approach to writing. For example, he characterizes his assignment as a reporter for the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; as a &quot;bungled assignment&quot; by the army that put him in the midst of reporters who had written for papers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; while his own experience was as sub-editor of &quot;The Thirteenth Field Artillery Brigade Bulletin&quot;. <br />One of the WWII-era personalities Rooney criticizes in this book is General George Patton, whom he views as overrated. Rooney slyly claims people who admire Patton are confusing him with George C. Scott. To Rooney's credit, he quotes a letter received, after unfavorable Patton comments on television, from the general's daughter in which she wrote that the general would not have liked him either. Ernest Hemingway and Charles De Gaulle are also singled out as pompous egomaniacs. General Eisenhower, on the other hand, Rooney praises for allowing &quot;The Stars and Stripes&quot; to have the editorial freedom of regular American newspapers.<br />Those who know Andy Rooney mainly from his &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; segments, once caricatured on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, may be surprised at the extent to which he saw action as a reporter in WWII. For example, he flew on a B17 raid over enemy territory and won the bronze star for battlefield reporting in Germany. At one point, he even managed to capture a German prisoner.<br />Much of what Rooney writes in this book is not pretty, such as seeing dead soldiers whose bodies had been crushed by tanks, watching the revenge that some of the citizens of Paris took on the German prisoners when the city was liberated, and coming upon the charred bodies of the Thekla concentration camp inmates that the SS had massacred as the Americans approached. <br />There are some light touches in this book apropos to human goodness as well. In France, Rooney writes &quot;every wandering dog was adopted and fed by some GI&quot;.<br />Rooney's books always mix humor and candid observation. The same is true here. However, Rooney has a more serious purpose in mind this time. The young men that he knew, killed in the war, he writes, did not give their lives, but rather those lives were taken. It would seem that this book is a way of reconciling the deaths of so many friends and fellow soldiers with Rooney's own relatively long and comfortable life. The book is dedicated to some of those close friends.	2001-12-30

Erichsen<BR>ISBN 10-57168-514-6<BR>2001<br />For the most part this is a very readable book. It traces Heino Erichsen's story from capture in North Africa as an eighteen year old German soldier through prison camps in the United States, to repatriation to Germany, and ultimately to return to the United States. <br />Erichsen's book initially interested me because in the town where I grew up in central Texas there had been a German prisoner of war camp. Mr. Erichsen's book answered my questions about life in those camps. The initial prison camp to which he was sent was Camp Hearne, Texas. The town was so depleted of agricultural labor that when the prisoners arrived at the camp, according to Erichsen, who spoke English, they were greeted with \\"Hi y'all, come on in.\\" As it turned out three-fourths of the prisoners were NCO's, who were exempted from work by the Geneva Convention. Accordingly, later, the locals dubbed the camp, \\"The Fritz Ritz\\". <br />During Erichsen's stay, Nazis murdered an English-speaking prisoner, who had translated for the camp's commanding officer. The translator was thought to be too friendly to the Americans. Erichsen wrote that his American captors failed to distinguish between the Nazis and the non-political types who made up most of the German army. This oversight led to incidents such as the translator's murder.<br />This book also discloses the fact, unknown at least to me, that after the war the German prisoners in the U.S. were not returned directly to Germany. Instead they had to serve one to two year terms in England, Scotland, Belgium, and France working on farms, in mines, or repairing war damages to make up for the manpower losses that those countries had suffered. Erichsen captured in 1943 did not make it back to his hometown of Kiel in north Germany until 1948. He writes that over 58 percent of the buildings had been destroyed. The city was barely recognizable.<br />After a while, Erichsen was ableto get a job as a translator for a British government organization. Outside of work, Erichsen wrote of the postwar period in Germany, it was difficult to have a social life of any kind because the men of his age had lost their contemporaries and the young women had lost their innocence. Surviving consumed the thoughts of women his age, he wrote. After six years, he returned to the United States with his new family. <br />Life in the U.S. was not an immediate success for Erichsen. He had given up an excellent job in Germany. After weeks of interviews, he learned that his references and education counted for nothing. He was a foreigner with an accent. Eventually, he got work. Later, his wife left him. He married again. He and his second wife went on to found an international adoption agency, which placed hundreds of orphans. This became his life's work and his way of coping with his wartime experiences.<br />Although \\"Reluctant Warrior\\" lacks the dramatic power of books such as \\"Destined to Witness\\" and \\"German Boy\\", two other books by Germans about their wartime experiences, it is nonetheless an interesting book. Its coverage of the lives of German prisoners in American POW camps provides an original insight into a somewhat forgotten aspect of our history.	2001-12-18
US	42494427	R10TZZKM98I38U	0300084668	888346679	Five Days in London: May 1940	Books	4	6	6	N	N	To Fight or Surrender	&quot;Five Days in London, May 1940&quot;<BR>John Lukacs<BR>ISBN 0-300-08466-8<BR>1999<br />There is not much question that the period in May of 1940 when Churchill and his cabinet debated about how to deal with Hitler is a critical period in world history. Certainly, this book is full of insights about the outlook of the British public and its leaders at that time. Excerpts from newspapers of that time and personal diaries of various individuals are used to support them. <br />It is surprising how little the British public recognized in what deep trouble England was with France hanging on the brink of capitulation to the Nazis. Other revelations include that Mussolini was viewed by high officials in the British government as a potential middleman for brokering an agreement with Hitler to avoid further military conflict between England and Germany. <br />It is startling that the issue of a British surrender during the dark days of Dunkirk was very much under consideration by British officials. According to Mr. Lukacs, a great deal of the credit for not going down that road belongs to Winston Churchill, to whom the author feels that western civilization is deeply indebted. <br />I believe Mr. Lukacs' biggest original insight in this book is to point out that Hitler was the most revolutionary leader of the twentieth century. He was a kind of leader that the world had previously not seen, one  who introduced a new kind of populist nationalism, evil though it was, which the old world order of Europe was not capable of withstanding. Those things being said, I would like to otherwise comment a little less favorably on some aspects of the book.<br />First of all, John Lukacs' style of writing in this book is extremely tedious. This is a short book that reads like a long one. The term \\"overanalyze\\" comes to mind.  Although I have great respect for documentation of historical research, it seems to me that the author goes off the deep end here. The text on some of the pages fights with the footnotes for space. I have to wonder for whom the author is writing. It would appear to be academicians. I doubt that George Orwell, who championed straightforward writing and whom the author quotes, would have looked favorably on the overly convoluted manner in which the story is developed here.  <br />Mr. Lukacs has found an interesting historical subject on which to focus. My feeling is that in this book the storyteller becomes a bit of an obstacle to the story.	2001-12-04

Samuel<BR>ISBN 0-7679-0824-4<BR>2000<br />This autobiography of childhood by Wolfgang Samuel is the story of a German boy growing up during World War II. When the momentum of the war turned against Germany, the Russians attacked from the east and routed the German army and civilian population as well. The book recounts how Samuel and his family abandoned their home and possessions and fled for their lives. In the following years, they survived under circumstances that most of us can hardly imagine. This is a very touching story, largely about the writer&#8216;s mother, who did whatever was necessary and paid any price for the survival of her children, the author and his younger sister. Although it is a story of deprivation and terror, it is also about acts of incredible courage and noble behavior under terrible circumstances by ordinary people. <br />This book is admirable in its originality and all the more powerful in having been written by the person who lived it. Above all, it is a remarkable story of courage and tenacity of the human spirit.	2001-11-29

Ambrose<BR>2001<BR>ISBN 0-7432-0339-9<br />When I heard a radio interview with George McGovern and Stephen Ambrose about the Wild Blue, I was eager to read it. The book follows the life of George McGovern from college in South Dakota when World War II broke out, through entry into the service, through various military schools and camps, and eventually into piloting a B-24 over Germany and Austria. <br />Although the time period and subject matter are similar, this book has little of the emotional feel of Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot;. This is probably because the book is more a military history than a commentary on generational values, as is the former. For example, toward the end, there is a discussion as to whether or not air power won the war. The military tactics are not as interesting to me as the cultural and social values with which relate to the war. In fact, I have to admit that I thought I would enjoy this book a lot more than I actually did. I admire Mr. Ambrose's clean, unfettered writing style. But this book lacks the inherently interesting quality to be found, for example, in the work of the historian, Barbara Tuchman.<br />George McGovern comes across in this book as a very admirable and courageous man, who, as Ambrose points out, made nothing at all of his exemplary service record when he ran for president as a peace candidate during the Vietnam War. McGovern seems to have had a remarkable ability to maintain his equanimity during the process of participating in thirty-five bombing raids against Nazi Germany. The crew of his plane regarded him as one of the best pilots in the Army Air Force, whose greatest concern was the well being of his crewmembers whose fate, had been placed in his hands. <br />Stephen Ambrose's book also documents the darker side of some of the Americans who flew in World War II in Europe. One evening, McGovern encountered two American fighter pilots at an officer's clubbragging about having machine-gunned two Italian non-combatants fishing from a bridge. One of McGovern's own crew reported to him that their new bombardier, instead of jettisoning his bombs in open countryside, after a failed bombing run, had waited until the plane was over a farmhouse and dropped the load on it. The man was accused of being a murderer by the crewmember, and he was never allowed to fly with McGovern again. <br />An interesting epilogue in this book to McGovern's wartime role has to do with his learning forty years after the war that a bomb which stuck in his bomb bay doors on a mission, only to destroy an Austrian farmhouse when pried loose, did not kill the occupants as he had thought. This accidental bombing had haunted him since the day it happened.<br />The scope of \\"The Wild Blue\\" is not broad about the air war in Europe, and it has some of the shortcomings that I have noted. However, it is still a worthwhile book to read. I would also conclude that George McGovern from the gallant way, in which he conducted himself in the war, in addition to his later political career, is a much-underrated American hero. He had learned the lessons of war and might have saved the nation a great deal suffering in the Vietnam War had he been elected president. The voters, however, chose, as you may recall, Richard Nixon.	2001-11-11
US	42494427	R1U38WHGGG5P4K	1860468233	483837365	Danube (Panther)	Books	3	65	79	N	N	The Danube is a Long River	Danube<BR>Claudio Magris<BR>2001<BR>ISBN 1-86046-823-3<br />I have seen the Danube at Donauwoerth in Germany and Linz and Melk in Austria. When I came across Claudio Magris' book, I was interested enough to buy it. Magris' book about the Danube is an unusual one. It is not a travel book, but more the historical reflections of a man visiting centuries-old towns along the river from where it originates in Germany to where it ends in the Black Sea in Rumania. <br />Since I have visited or read about some of the towns along the Danube in the German-speaking world, I found that part of the book more interesting. I knew less about the other countries -- Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Rumania, and I did not relate as well to that part of the book.<br />On the whole, there are some obstacles to overcome in reading this book. The writer's style is rather wordy and rambling. In one sentence, for example, I counted seventy-five words. There are endless literary and historical references, many of which are somewhat obscure. For me, eventually they grew tiresome.  The book, in English, is a translated work. At points, one wonders if the rendering of sentences such as, \\"That life which the photograph fixed in one of its instants is vanished forever\\", could not have been translated in plainer English. <br />Still, some of this book is good reading.  Magris' story about the director of the river works at Linz who spent a lifetime marking out the confines of the upper Danube and wrote a three volume work of 2,164 pages about all the aspects of the river from the different types of rafts and barges to the poems, songs, plays, and novels that related to the river is amusing. At the other extreme, Magris' description of visiting the terrible stone quarry at Mauthausen concentration camp that the Nazis set up on the Danube, where 110,000 people died, is disturbing.<br />On the whole, I would say this book is interesting reading in places. Elsewhere, it drags a bit. For example, consider a sentence such as, \\"Are the Istrians therefore Thracians, as Apollodorus thought, or Colchians, according to the view of Pliny and Strabo, or are they Gepids? \\" <br />Perhaps, the main problem with \\"Danube\\" is that the scope and coverage of the book are simply too great. The countries through which the lower reaches of the Danube flow do not have so much in common with those of the German-speaking part of the Danube. Like the Nile, it is a very long river, and, similarly it comes into contact with a number of lands with differing cultural traditions and histories. The Danube as an organizational theme for Magris' reflections about history and literature falters in the face of the great diversity of the material. Also, there is the question of if this book is really about the Danube or more a vehicle for Magris' wide-ranging interests.	2001-10-09

There is some good information in this book. It helped us several times on a trip to Germany and Austria. <br />The coverage about the Mittelrhein is informative. I liked Steves' map of the castles between Koblenz and Bingen. Largely due to his coverage of the town of Bacharach, we spent two nights there. We were not alone. I actually saw a tourist walking down the street with a copy of this book in his hand. One place offering lodging had a sign out front about being mentioned in this book. Despite these things, Bacharach is a charming town, where one can walk everywhere or take a boat to the next town. The town is surrounded by vineyards, and the local wine that can be tried in several establishments in town is exceptionally good.<br />In Rothenburg, Steve's book came in handy late one afternoon, upon arriving after the tourist office had closed. Being in a walled city as evening approaches with no prospect of a place to stay can be a little traumatic. We studied the book, bought a city map, and navigated the twisting medieval streets to a place mentioned. We got a room. The host was a pleasant elderly gentleman, who offered a good room at a reasonable price. <br />Moving on to Salzburg, Austria, Steves' book failed us somewhat. We got caught in a lot of traffic, could not find the accommodation area he described, although stopping to ask several times, eventually gave up in frustration, and went to Berchtesgaden, Germany, not too far away. The book had very little information on Berchtesgaden although there were many charming places to stay there and in other smaller towns along the way. The country inn where we stayed was very pleasant. There were some great views of the mountains from the grounds. The Berchtesgaden area is truly beautiful, but one would not have known this from Steves' book.<br />I do give Rick Steves credit for directing us to the town of Reutte in Tyrol. The cozy farmhouse where we stayed in Ehenbickl, an adjacent town, had been in the owners' family for 700 years. The hospitality was second to none.  Reutte is situated on the Lech River about a twenty-minute drive from Neuschwanstein, perhaps the most touristy place in Germany. <br />On the whole, this book by Rick Steves was quite helpful to us. However, his coverage is somewhat hit or miss. He does cover many interesting places to visit. However, he leaves just as many out and skips over others. Berchtesgaden would be a case in point. He also dismisses the city of Heidelberg, one of the most beautiful cities in Germany in a few sentences as being too tourist-oriented. This is ironic because Rothenburg, though worth a trip, is about as oriented to tourism as a town can be. <br />Despite some shortcomings, Rick Steves' book is still a good travel book.My advice, however, would be not to bind yourself to it, like the tourist I saw in Bacharach. Use the Internet to locate places to stay in the German speaking world and send e-mail to make reservations. In local inns and farmhouses, you will not have to give a credit card number. They will actually trust you.  Austria has exceptional web pages. There one can find some of the most serene, beautiful farmhouse accommodations, at inexpensive prices, in Europe. Gute Reise!

US	42494427	RA1ROWZIKYA1D	1857328752	645062948	Touring In Wine Country: Mosel & Rheing	Books	5	15	15	N	N	German Wine and Travel	The Mosel &amp; Rheingau including the Ahr, Nahe,and Pfalz<BR>Stuart Pigott<BR>1997<br />I was first introduced to German wine as a soldier in Germany some years ago.  I have enjoyed it ever since. There are two things in this book about German wine that make it extraordinary, the maps and the photographs.<br />Detailed maps show the location of the vineyards in relationship to the wine-producing towns. So when one buys a bottle of German wine in the United States, he or she can read the label, for example, on a bottle of Muellheimer Sonnenlay and locate the Sonnenlay vineyard near the town of Muellheim on the appropriate map.<br />The photographs in this book are beautiful. One example would be the picture of the market place in Trier, the so-called oldest town in Germany. There are also photos of the rivers, the towns, and the vineyards.<br />I have visited some of the wine-producing towns on the Mosel and some on the Mittelrhein and sampled wines. For me, these are some of the best wines in Germany. On the Mosel, from personal experience, the towns of Zell, Bernkastel-Kues, and Piesport offer outstanding wines, and they are worth a visit. On the Rhine, my favorite wine town is Bacharach, which produces some equally good wine. The coverage of these towns in the book is, in my opinion, very good. <br />In his book, Stuart Pigott also clarifies the \\"Praedikat\\" system, used for classifying wine types, such as \\"Spaetlese\\" und \\"Auslese\\", according to the level of grape sugar in them. He also lists the names of some of the wine estates for each area with a comment on them, as well as the phone number, for those who wish to visit. Pigott also reluctantly points out a few German wines that are not what they are supposed to be. An example is Piesporter Michelsberg, most of which is not even from a Piesport vineyard. I have seen this in good wine sections in stores in the United States next to the authentic and fine Piesporter Goldtroepchen.<br />Even if the reader is not particularly interested in wine, the book provides a good deal of information about the towns along the Mosel and Rhine rivers, and it can be used to help plan trips. As mentioned, there are photos of many of the towns with a description of the high points, along with some recommended hotels and restaurants.<br />On the whole, from my own experience traveling in Germany and tasting numerous wines, I think this is an excellent book for understanding German wines and equally good for planning trips to some of the most interesting towns in some of the most beautiful river valleys in Germany.	2001-09-16
US	42494427	RKIHQ6WC3W2D4	0385334621	190088526	The Greatest Generation	Books	4	5	7	N	N	A Greater Generation	The Greatest Generation Tom Brokaw<BR>ISBN 0-385-33462-1<BR>2001<BR>Tom Brokaw's &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; is a collection of short biographies of people who were young adults at the outbreak of World War II. Some of the people that Brokaw writes about are well known, such as George Bush, Andy Rooney, Bob Dole, Art Buchwald, Daniel Inouye, and Julia Childs. Others are ordinary folks. <br />Brokaw began to hear the stories that went into this book when he went to France to do a television program on the fiftieth anniversary of D-day in 1984. The stories reminded him of his boyhood experiences on a South Dakota army post during the war. Writing this book was something of a sentimental experience for Mr. Brokaw. One is charmed by incidents such as the time when the young Brokaw needed a lawnmower to make money, and his father built him one from salvaged parts, including ones from an old washing machine.<br />Brokaw observes in these stories that most Americans of that time were from rural backgrounds, extremely self-reliant, and largely honorable people, who tried to do what they saw as the right thing. They had grown up during the depression with little, and they expected little. When called upon to make sacrifices during the war they did so at an enormous cost to themselves and their families, and they did so in a remarkably selfless manner. The values that these people held are not widely-held values today, and thus it is interesting to look back at these men and women, in a book such as this, to understand who they were and how they came to be. <br />As an example of self-reliance, Brokaw writes about a man who grew up in the poverty of the dust bowl and got a job at Boeing Aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. At the plant men worked twelve to fourteen hours a day, but the farm boys they hired were accustomed to long hours. On the farm, he had taken tractors apart and put them back together and gotten up at 4:00 in the morning to milk the cows. In the aircraft factory, when desired materials could not be found, he and the other toolmakers improvised by making tools out of Masonite or Maplewood. They had an instinct for creativity and inventiveness.<br />Women pitched in during the war and contributed in new ways. A woman from Indiana was one of the 25,000 who volunteered for the Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASPS). She too was raised on a farm. She started taking flying lessons in 1940, and got a license just in time to join the war effort. She spent six months of training in various airplanes in Sweetwater, Texas. In Wilmington, Delaware, she was assigned to testing and transporting planes used to train men as combat pilots. Other women towed targets for anti-aircraft and airborne target practice. Sometimes they returned home with<BR>bullet holes in their planes.<br />There was a great sense of community in the United State during the war years. In the Kerry Corner neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, many in the Irish, working-class neighborhood signed up for the armed forces. Someone put up a banner with a star for every young man who had enlisted or was drafted. Mothers and fathers gathered on the square to get together Christmas packages for the boys.<br />Although I found this book to be worthwhile reading, I also found a few shortcomings. First, the selection of stories is tipped too much in favor of the well known. One suspects that these are people that Brokaw has met as a person of influence, rather than individuals who represent the greater masses. <br />Second, Tom Brokaw is a professional reporter, but not a professional writer. I did not feel that he added much insight beyond telling the stories of some of the men and women who served in the war, somewhat the way Studs Terkel did by transcribing the interviews for his book, \\"Working\\".<br />Last, the notion of the title, \\"The Greatest Generation\\" is an exaggeration that serves no good purpose. One wonders what other generations were researched and considered for this particular honor. Clearly, the answer is likely none. Perhaps, \\"A Greater Generation\\" would have been a better and more accurate description of what Mr. Brokaw wrote about. On the whole though, Brokaw's book does give appropriate attention to a generation that one may find more admirable than some that have followed. His achievement is in reminding us of the days when most Americans were less affluent, less materialistic, and less self-serving.	2001-09-04
US	42494427	R2VEYCL9HKPQ4P	0688171559	330344806	Destined to Witness: Growing Up Black in Nazi Germany	Books	5	70	77	N	N	Witness	Destined to Witness  Hans Massaquoi ISBN 0-688-17155-9 1999<br />&quot;Destined to Witness&quot; is the story of the son of a black Liberian diplomatic official and a white German woman growing up in Nazi times in Germany. Were this story not so convincingly told, one would have to question that the events of Mr. Massaquois life could have really taken place. But they did take place. Not only did the author survive the Hitler years without being killed by the Nazis, but he survived 200 British and American bombing raids that destroyed half of the Hamburgs homes, including his own, and killed 41,000 civilians. <br />From this book, one learns not only about Massaquois experience with racism in Germany in the Hitler era but about British and French colonial racism in Africa and racism in the United States in the South and in Chicago after the war. Hans Massaquoi would have us understand that these instances of racism were not unrelated.<br />This book begins with Hans Massaquois early schoolboy experiences growing up in Hamburg. It recounts the terrible racial taunting of pro-Nazi classmates and teachers. In one of his worst school episodes he tells how one teacher told him that after the Nazis had  finished with the Jews they would take care of the likes of him. Massaquoi, growing up in the German culture, wanted to be like the other boys to a certain extent. At one point, he was rejected for admission to the Hitler Youth Corp on the basis of his race. Although initially Hitler was a hero to him, later he came to understand  more clearly what Hitler represented. <br />This book describes a number of interesting historical events that Massaquoi witnessed. For example, one was the day the airship Hindenburg flew over his neighborhood in Hamburg, casting its giant shadow over the street on which he lived and all the people who gathered there to see it. In another place, the author describes the aftermath of Kristallnacht in November 1938, the first, Nazi-ordered, countrywide rampage against the Jews. Sidewalks along Hamburgs main shopping avenue, on both sides,  for miles, were covered with broken glass in front of windowless stores where all the merchandise had been looted. <br />The author attributes his own survival through this period to the fact that there were few blacks in the Germany of that time, and Hitlers executioners initially focused their efforts on the Jews. Fortunately, Hitler was defeated before he could finish his ultimate goal of racial purification. Also, Mr. Massaquoi attributes his survival to the fact that, even in these dark hours, there were many Germans who retained their decency  after it had gone totally out of style.  To these people, whose refusal to go along with the prevailing racism of the day, he gives recognition.<br />Massaquoi eventually came to the U.S. after the war, served in the army, attended college on the G. I. bill, marched with Martin Luther King, served as the managing editor of &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine and met American presidents.<br />This book presents a unique opportunity to look inside Nazi times in Germany, not through the eyes of an historian, but through the eyes of someone who lived in them, and as the title suggests, as a witness to history. I highly recommend this unusual book. It is extremely interesting reading. I believe some of those who travel this road will come away with the feeling that they have been changed by the journey.	2001-08-20
