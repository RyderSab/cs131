Much of this is accomplished in a kind of _House and Garden_ fashion.  We are shown a distinguished English country house on a hill above the Thames:<br /><br />\\"A long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers.  The house had a name and a history . . .\\"<br /><br /> . . . and so do its noble occupants, a wealthy American expatriate and his son.<br /><br />When their cousin Isabel arrives, she acquires merit in the reader's eyes by her appreciation of Gardencourt:<br /><br />\\"Her uncle's house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need.  The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky corners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on dark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the center of a `property' - a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where the tread was muffled by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk - these things were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions.\\"<br /><br />Later, Lord Warburton, a worthy English lord, acquires standing through Isabel's appreciation of his habitation, Lockleigh:<br /><br />\\". . . as they saw it from the gardens, a stout, grey pile, of the softest, deepest, most weather-fretted hue,rising from a broad, still moat, it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend.\\"<br /><br />James advances his characterizations through dialogue as well, but not, at least in the first part of the book, through action.  His work in the first part of _The Portrait_ is like the work of Osmond, a character introduced later in the book, who executes a minute representation of an antique coin using watercolors: the representation is beautiful, it is \\"art,\\" but there is no sense of movement or striving.<br /><br />Isabel eventually inherits a fortune that makes her independent; she is courted by gallant gentlemen, and she encounters some less savory characters. This is a sad book: we don't want to see Isabel brought down to earth.  I must say I was dissatisfied with the abrupt ending of the book that fails to resolve Isabel's situation.  Even with this imperfection, this is a beautifully written novel.<br /><br />The Penguin Classics edition of _The Portrait_ is worth the price, with lovely cover art by John Singer Sargent.  It includes a useful introduction and plot summary by Geoffrey Moore (like almost all introductions to fiction, it is best appreciated after reading the book itself), a preface and notes by the author, endnotes, a chronology, and a bibliography.	2005-10-09

It is a fictional account of the life of Henry James, an exceptional artist and observer of life in the late nineteenth century.  The tone of the book - it's reserve and calm - are appropriate to its subject, a man who relied heavily on his own company and inner life.<br /><br />The book relates a number of significant incidents in James' life, and through them we gain an understanding of his character and motivations.  As a boy and young man, he is entirely focused on reading and writing.  As he becomes a man, the Civil War is raging and two of his brothers fight for the North.  James stands apart from the conflict, uncomfortably, aware that physical courage is not a part of his nature.  Several incidents in his adult life - an encounter with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., his enduring relationship with Hendrik Andersen, and the trial and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde for sodomy - illuminate James' unconsummated homosexuality and the attitudes of his contemporaries toward what was regarded as a dangerous perversion.<br /><br />A major theme in the book is James' alienation.  At the death of his sister, James reflects that \\"Both he and his sister would die childless; what they owned was theirs only while they lived.  There would be no direct heirs.  They had both recoiled from engagements, deep companionship, the warmth of love.\\"  James, of course, was compensated by his inner life and by the creative process he engaged in as a writer, which required some observational distance from the rest of humanity.  Another theme involves cultural differences and how James, the expatriate American, enjoyed them.  Another theme, and an extremely important one, concerns the compromises that James made in his life, and how they did not diminish him.<br /><br />A major feature of the book, and one of its greatest attractions, is the depiction of domestic scenes at Lamb House, James' residence in Rye, England, his adopted home.  An excellent passage in the book describes the attraction that a comfortable home can have for a sensitive and solitary soul:  \\"He imagined himself each evening seated in the rich glow of a lamp in an old paneled room, the floorboards darkly varnished and covered in rugs, the fire lighting, the burning wood oozing and crackling, the heavy curtains drawn, a long day's work completed and no social duties looming.\\"  This was the best part of life for a solitary man like James.	2005-08-28

O Pioneers!, by Willa Cather, is set in Hanover, Nebraska, where:  <br /> <br />\\"The rich soil yields heavy harvests; the dry, bracing climate and the smoothness of the land make labor easy for men and beasts.  There are few scenes more gratifying than a spring plowing in that country, where the furrows of a single field often lie a mile in length, and the brown earth, with such a strong, clean smell, and such a power of growth and fertility in it, yields itself eagerly to the plow; rolls away from the shear, not even dimming the brightness of the metal, with a soft, deep sigh of happiness.\\" <br /> <br />But it was not always this way: a generation earlier, a few pioneers had to struggle mightily to establish their farms, and some perished. <br /> <br />The protagonist of O Pioneers! is Alexandra, a woman who possesses some common virtues, like industry and kindness, and some less common ones, like foresight.  In this novel, virtues have predictable results: Alexandra has the best farm in Hanover and can count on the friendship of many neighbors.  Most importantly, with Carl, a friend from her childhood, she maintains a lifelong friendship that develops into a romance when Carl returns after a long absence.  If virtues have predictable results in this novel, so do character flaws: those who yield to temptation suffer the consequences quickly and surely. <br /> <br />Some readers may find that the themes in this novel are a bit too simple for their tastes, but I found it to be beautifully written and uplifting.  Those who are new to Cather's work might better start with My Antonia or Death Comes to the Archbishop, but her established fans will certainly want to read O Pioneers! as well. <br />	2005-08-21

The novel has a complex structure, consisting of six separate narratives that interrupt and refer to one another: <br /> <br />- In \\"The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,\\" set in the eighteenth century, an idealistic American notary undertakes a voyage to the South Pacific, where he observes nearly universal cruelty and cynicism. <br /> <br />- \\"Letters from Zedelghem\\" follows a young composer and con artist to Belgium, where he encounters a renowned musical genius and becomes his amanuensis.   <br /> <br />- \\"Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery,\\" is a send-up of the thriller genre with a plucky and attractive reporter taking on an evil nuclear energy corporation. <br /> <br />- In \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish,\\" an aging rake angers the wrong people and suffers for it, amusingly. <br /> <br />- \\"An Orison of Sonmi-451,\\" set in the future, follows the career of an unexpectedly intelligent clone. <br /> <br />- In \\"Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After,\\" a primitive in the far future encounters an advanced culture.   <br /> <br />The conclusions that Mitchell reaches about human history and meaning are pessimistic.  But man is by nature optimistic, and Mitchell allows one of his characters to say that: <br /> <br />\\"If we believe that humanity may transcend tooth and claw, it we believe divers races & creeds can share this world as peaceably as the orphans share their candlenut tree, if we believe leaders must be just, violence muzzled, and power accountable & the riches of the Earth & its Oceans shared equitably, such a world will come to pass.\\" <br /> <br />This book was fun to read - I read it at the beach, in fact - and it offers memorable characters, some imaginative plotting, and a few wise (even startling) observations.  It was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize in 2004. <br />	2005-08-21

Thoreau's account is highly idiosyncratic and obscure.  To be honest, it is a chore to read it through to the end.  But Thoreau is wise on some subjects and, even better, he is funny.  He is also very quotable, as this review demonstrates excessively. <br /> <br />Thoreau begins _Walden_ with a scathing depiction of the senseless, directionless activity of modern life: <br /> <br />\\"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\\" <br /> <br />And: <br /> <br />\\"Men labor under a mistake.  The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost.  By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal.  It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.\\" <br /> <br />Instead of working harder to produce more, Thoreau decides to want less, and leaves corrupt society behind to live at Walden Pond.  There, he takes refuge in naturalism.  He plants a crop of beans, he takes long walks, he observes the animals that share his woods, and he engages in some amateurish scientific speculation.  Thoreau is not a hermit: he often visits the village of Concord, Massachusetts, and enjoys visiting with infrequent visitors at Walden Pond.  But he finds that a little bit of society can go a long way: <br /> <br />\\"We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other.  We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are.  We have had to agreeon a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. ... We live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another.  Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications. ... It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I live.\\" <br /> <br />One of my favorite passages in the book describes the author as he leaves behind the brightly lit village and walks home through the woods alone to his cabin:   <br /> <br />\\"It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing.  I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire \\"as I sailed.\\"  I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms.  It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose.  I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night.\\" <br /> <br />After a minute description of his life at Walden, extending over the bulk of the book, Thoreau suddenly tires of that part of the narrative and decides to fast forward a bit in what I think is the funniest paragraph in the book: <br /> <br />\\"Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second year was similar to it.  I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.\\" <br /> <br />In the last part of the book, \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,\\" Thoreau expresses a radical libertarianism: <br /> <br />\\"I heartily accept the motto, -- 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically.  Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, -- 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\\" <br /> <br />An opponent of the war with Mexico and the institution of slavery, Thoreau decides to do something about it, and lands in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax.  In life as in politics, Thoreau advocates a life of deliberation followed by action: <br /> <br />\\"There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. ... To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.  It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.\\" <br />	2005-07-30

It is also a love story about Joe and Violet Trace, who escape violent repression in the South and come to New York City.  To them, the city is a paradise.  The city - and the \\"lowdown music\\" that is heard everywhere - cast a spell over everyone, but especially over the young.  Eventually a young lady, motivated by the simplest and most basic needs, enters Joe's life and comes to harm. <br /> <br />The narrator recognizes the suffering that visits most of us in this life, and specifically the terrible suffering of blacks in the United States, but the characters in this book, through love, rise above suffering.  They are a little bit better than real people. <br /> <br />A side benefit of reading this book was that it inspired me to read a little bit about jazz in the early 1900s and to listen to a little bit of Duke Ellington, James Reese Europe, and Louis Armstrong.  So I was improved from reading the book and then improved from listening to the music. <br /> <br />	2005-07-24

By following the family's fortunes, author Isabel Allende (niece of Salvador Allende, the socialist President of Chile) examines the major social and political developments in Chile's modern history. <br /> <br />The family patriarch, Esteban Trueba, is a practical man and can get things done, but he is cruel and despotic. He builds a fortune through his land holdings, his mine, and later through speculation.  He becomes a Conservative Senator but then, in his full maturity, painful events force him to examine some rather gaping holes in the ideology he clung to as a younger man.  Trueba's wife, Clara, lives with one foot in this world and the other in a world of spirits and supernatural forces.  The couple's three children, their lovers, and their children interact with one another and with the forces of change in Chile over many decades. <br /> <br />Allende romanticizes the socialists in Chile, depicting them as brave and selfless.  The peasants, the focus of their concern, are foolish and short-sighted, but harmless.  On the other hand, the Creole elite are selfish and predatory, and the military are little more than bestial savages.  This makes it sound as if Allende is a little bit ham fisted but of course she is not.  In fact, her portrayal of controversial events in Chilean history is highly illuminating. <br />  <br />The House of Spirits is very engaging, with wonderful characters and a lot of action, and it inspired me to learn more about Chile.  I think that this epic novel will appeal to many different types of readers.  <br />	2005-07-04

For him, the accident is an opportunity to show that we are all part of God's intelligent plan, not victims of random, meaningless events.  His study of these five lives takes many years to complete and fills volumes.  In the end, of course, he falls short of his purpose.  But his research shows something else.  It shows how God's love is expressed in our world, sometimes through worthy and sometimes through what appear to be unworthy messengers.  It also shows that no one is so alienated from God that he cannot be reached.  Eventually, Brother Juniper suffers for his pretensions to expose the operations of God's will. <br /> <br />Besides its deeply affecting exposition of the theme described above, The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a beautiful evocation of life in 18th century colonial Peru.  Thornton Wilder's writing is just exquisite.  In one scene, a selfish woman undergoes a transformation and spends the night composing an important letter to her daughter.  Before dawn, she goes to the door upon her balcony and looks up \\"at the great tiers of stars that glittered above the Andes.  Throughout the night, though there had been few to hear it, the whole sky had been loud with the singing of these constellations.\\" <br /> <br />The 1975 Pocket Book (Washington Square Enriched Classics) edition I have includes an interesting reader's supplement with illustrations and notes. <br />	2005-06-28

Spooner has done a good job of assembling testimony from many, many sources to document a long list of murders, kidnappings, and torture committed by the regime.  Unfortunately, she does not complement this reporting with any significant analysis that would allow the reader to understand how the military regime was able to take power in a 1973 coup, why so many Chileans initially supported the coup, how Pinochet was able to dominate the rest of the military government and become a dictator, or why Pinochet was eventually forced to relinquish power.  In place of analysis, we get a number of rather sweeping and unsupported generalizations (\\"military dictators are unaccustomed to making concessions and are unskilled in the art of diplomacy\\").  Spooner also occasionally stoops to innuendo, as when she writes that a conspiracy theory that the U.S. Government injected Chilean fruit with cyanide to weaken the Pinochet regime has \\"a certain logic.\\"  Still, Spooner has done us a service by pulling together a large number of first hand accounts of the abuses committed by the Pinochet regime.	2005-06-15

Rowling's Harry Potter series but the first that I've read.  My daughter urged me to read it and since she's a teenager I'm happy for any opportunity to make a connection with her.<br /><br />Readers familiar with this series or the Harry Potter movies will know that this book focuses on Harry Potter, a young wizard, and his two best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.  Harry plays a leading role in a pitched struggle between good and evil wizards, and it is this struggle that provides the necessary suspense in the novel.  Harry is not particularly smart, but he is brave.  Hermione is the smart one.  Ron is a goofy sidekick to Harry and he \\"likes\\" Hermione although he doesn't always know it.  Behind this trio is a legion of well-developed major and minor characters, from the evil Lord Valdemort to the wise Professor Dumbledore, from bureaucrats to bullies, from giants to elves and goblins.<br /><br />These characters interact in a believable magical world, complete with poverty (the Weasleys are good and hard working but poor), prejudice (against muggles* and wizards with muggle parents), and injustice (wizards enjoy privilege; elves form a servant class). The furniture of this magical world is appealing: a giant bathtub with a diving board, portraits that talk, a purple carpeted stadium for the Quidditch world cup, fires that send purple sparks into the air, and so on.  Hogwarts castle is the site of most of the action, and here there are many cozy interior scenes in front of the fire at Hagrid's cabin or in the Gryffindor common room.<br /><br />Beyond the major theme of good versus evil, this book has many themes that will appeal to the young audience that Rowling is aiming at.  There is much attention paid to the price of fame: while Harry's fame makes him the center of attention, it also makes people envious and ready to believe the worst about him.  Harry often suffers in silence rather than trying to correct those misimpressions.  In fact, for a powerful wizard, Harry has remarkably little control over the events that affect him.  He pretty much has to do what the adults around him tell him to do, a plight that Rowling's intended readers are familiar with.<br /><br />* Muggles are ordinary humans with no magical powers.

By virtue of his parentage, however - his father was a British soldier - he has one foot in another world as well.  Throughout the book, Kim seeks his identity - will he live the simpler, unencumbered life that he loves, or will he join the world of the Sahibs, the men who rule India?  . <br /> <br />At the opening of the book, Kim shows kindness to an elderly Tibetan lama and, in the lama's eyes, anyway, becomes his disciple.  Kim accompanies the lama on a quest to find a mythical river where the lama believes they will find enlightenment.  Eventually, the lama pays for Kim's education; while he is at school, the British groom Kim to become a spy.  Throughout the rest of the book Kim travels with the lama, performing his work inconspicuously so as not to disillusion the old and rather oblivious lama.  Along the way they encounter all that is good and bad in India.  The lama wants to escape the Wheel of Life; Kim notices that \\"by the roadside trundled the very Wheel itself, eating, drinking, trading, marrying, and quarrelling - all warmly alive.\\" <br />  <br />The book examines the relative merits of action and inaction; of the worldliness and other-worldliness.  \\"What profit to kill men?\\" asks the lama.  \\"Very little - as I know;\\" says an old soldier, \\"but if evil men were not now and then slain it would not be a good world for weaponless dreamers.\\"  Later, the lama tells Kim that \\"To abstain from action is well - except to acquire merit.\\"  \\"At the Gates of Learning we were taught that to abstain from action was unbefitting a Sahib.  And I am a Sahib,\\" Kim says, revealing his choice of identity. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully written book and a wonderful depiction of life in Colonial India.

Nonplussed, Orlando decides that it is  \\"better to be quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the human spirit, which are . . . contemplation, solitude, love.\\"   <br /> <br />There follows much discussion of gender and gender confusion.  Woolf tells us that: <br /> <br />\\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity.  Clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath.  It was a change in Orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex.  And perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual - openness indeed was the soul of her nature - something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed.  For here again, we come to a dilemma.  Different though the sexes are, they intermix.  In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\" <br /> <br />There are many other themes in this imaginary biography which spans centuries.  One is comical examination of English society and culture: <br /> <br />\\"Thus, stealthily, and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it. ...  The muffin was invented and the crumpet.  Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and., as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and antimacassars, the home - which had become extremely important - was completely altered.\\" <br /> <br />This \\"biography\\" is also metafiction, and there are several humorous references to the act of writing.  In fact, Orlando herself writes prolifically throughout the novel (carrying with her a poem, \\"The Oak Tree,\\" that must constantly be revised as she changes).and encounters many literary figures, among them the revered Alexander Pope who makes a big impression: \\" ... `How noble his brow is,' she thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr. Pope's forehead in the darkness).\\"   <br /> <br />Sometimes I don't get Virginia Woolf, but I was very entertained by this novel.	2005-05-07

So this book is tough going for much of the way.  Somewhere near halfway through the book, you begin to recognize the different threads of the plot and the book begins to make more sense.  At this point, you want to begin marking up every page with cross-references and notes, to keep track of what is going on.  I would say that this book is a good subject for study but I'm not sure that it's a good read.  In fact, I'm not even sure it can be read, in the usual sense of the word, by most people outside India.   <br /> <br />But it's worth the effort to try.  Midnight's Children is an intense and revealing exploration of India's culture and politics, mixing factual information (\\" . . . although there is considerable disagreement about the number of 'political' prisoners taken during the Emergency, either thirty thousand or a quarter of a million persons certainly lost their freedom.\\"), humorous observations (\\" . . . the water shortage had reached the point where milkmen could no longer find clean water with which to adulterate the milk . . .\\"), and wildly imagined events (a communist snake charmer induces a pair of cobras to act out a rich man refusing to give alms to a beggar, police harassment, hunger, disease, and illiteracy).  The narrator is Saleem Sinai, a man born at midnight on the day of India's independence.  His destiny, of course, is closely bound up with that of his country.  He and one thousand other \\"midnight's children,\\" alternately influence the course of history and are influenced by it in all sorts of improbable ways.

As everyone must know, the book depicts a group of schoolboys marooned on a tropical island, where in the absence of an overbearing state they soon fall into the \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" existence predicted by Thomas Hobbes and many other political philosophers.<br /><br />This is a wonderful premise for a novel, but Golding's treatment of it is pedestrian and there is little here that is surprising or entertaining.  On the first page, we meet a fat boy with glasses.  He's obviously doomed.  On the fourth page, we read that another boy has \\"a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.\\"  So we know he's not going to be at the top of the food chain, either.  And so on.<br /><br />Admittedly, part of the problem may be that the book has been so widely read and discussed.  Supposing that this book may have more to offer someone who is not already familiar with its theme, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and three stars.	2005-04-16

The author employs a lot of technique here: different points of view, unorthodox time sequencing, and an unusual approach to plot revelation.  The book is not easy to read, particularly the first part that is told from the point of Benjy, a retarded man whose thoughts are particularly fragmented.  Near the middle of the book, plot revelation becomes a little bit more direct and the reader begins to gain confidence in Faulkner's skills.  Still, throughout the book, important events are suggested rather than stated, so the reader merely gathers what has happened.  By the end of the book, the reader has a reasonably satisfying understanding of the events and characters that are depicted in the book, although there is no denouement.<br /><br />The book, set in the deep South at the opening of the 20th century, depicts the dissolution of a once prominent family.  Faulkner depicts selfishness as the greatest of their sins: the only characters that come off reasonably well are those that care for others.  Unfortunately, there's not enough care to go around, and by the end of the book there's not much holding the family together but habit.<br /><br />This is not a book that I particularly enjoyed reading but it left me impressed with Faulkner's abilities and sensibilities.  It is widely considered to be one of Faulkner's greatest works and I would say deservedly so.	2005-04-16

The book focuses on Carol Kennicott, a librarian from worldly Minneapolis, who takes on the task of reforming her husband and the rest of the the fictional town of Gopher Prairie.   <br /> <br />The book is quite funny and I laughed out loud a few times.  People who grew up in the Midwest will recognize a lot of the characters here. <br /> <br />Although he pokes fun at them, Lewis is not unkind in his assessment of the townspeople, and the book has many touching aspects.  For example, Carol's husband, Will, is maddeningly unromantic: he is happiest when he is in the basement feeding and caressing the furnace.   But he is also a country doctor, a devoted husband who knows that he has a prize in Carol, and a competent man who can amputate a limb, or handle a team of horses in a blizzard.  Their marriage is a strange alliance of two unlike beings but it nonetheless holds something of great value for both of them.  <br /> <br /> Lewis also writes with great feeling about nature - the force of the seasons on the prairie, the hush as twilight falls on farmers' fields, the spectacle of ducks over a lake.  <br /> <br />This is a fine piece of work that memorializes life in a quieter time.	2005-03-14

Many migrants end up in informal communities (slums) scattered around old urban cores.  The nature of these slums is fundamentally different from the nature of slums in the industrialized countries.  In a slum in an industrialized country, existing structures have deteriorated due to poverty.  In a slum in a developing country, the residents are building new structures and then improving them as they accumulate more durable construction materials.  Eventually, the residents may gain access to water, sewer, and electric service, although this typically requires tearing down a portion of the new construction to provide rights of way for utilities.   <br /> <br />Within these informal communities, one finds tremendous entrepreneurial spirit and energy in the form of small factories, shops, street kiosks, and other small and micro enterprises.  Through their efforts, the inhabitants of informal communities have accumulated land and improvements worth more than $9 trillion, according to Hernando de Soto's estimate.  However, because they do not enjoy formal property rights, the value of their investment is impaired: they cannot enforce contracts in court, obtain mortgages, or protect their property against opportunists. <br /> <br />All industrialized societies have made a transition from informal to formal property rights.  In every case, de Soto maintains, formal laws had to be amended to bring them into congruence with the informal property rights that have arisen spontaneously through negotiation: what we might call common law or the social contract.  For example, in the recent history of the United States, people could establish an informal claim to land by felling trees, building a home, or raising a crop.  Eventually, these informal claims became so numerous that most property was held outside the formal legal system, making the law irrelevant to most citizens.  To maintain the legitimacy of the law, the formal legal system had to be changed to recognize the facts that had been established \\"on the ground.\\"   In effect, the law had to catch up to reality.   <br /> <br />When this is accomplished in the developing countries, de Soto says, a huge source of capital will be mobilized and, more importantly, the poor will become more effectively enfranchised and engaged in the capitalist system.   <br /> <br />This book has considerable strengths: in particular, its basis in field work and practical experience, its documentation of conditions in informal communities in developing countries, and its conception of poor people as a resource rather than a problem.  It has some weaknesses too.  For example, de Soto ridicules cultural explanations for poverty but does not effectively confront them.  In fact, there is a close relationship between culture (e.g., norms that encourage cooperation with others) and formal law, since trust reduces the need for formal enforcement mechanisms and opportunism increases it. Also, while de Soto has something important to say, he doesn't say it very succinctly.  The nature of capital is not as mysterious as he supposes, and much space in the book is spent belaboring the obvious.	2005-03-14

The story is told by Chief Bromden, a fragile giant who has delusions about the Combine, a conspiracy that runs the economy and keeps the population under control.  In the mental hospital where he lives, the Combine is capably represented by Nurse Ratched, a rather tightly wound mother figure.  Using a combination of psychological manipulation, drugs, and shock therapy, she and the rest of the staff keep the inmates in a passive state of acquiescence until her system is upset by the arrival of McMurphy, a red-headed drifter and non-conformist.  The point of the book, of course, is to show how socialization processes have a homogenizing, leveling effect.  Societies work best when people are interchangeable; exceptional people, or people who can't fit in, are usually not welcome.	2005-02-13

Judging from what she has written, in her ideal world, people would be thin, entrepreneurial, and selfish.     Some people are of the opinion that this book is a page turner, and it is true that Rand can be compelling in a bombastic, apocalyptic way.  One character - Tooney, a bad guy - wants to control the world.  Another character - Wyand, who is both good and bad - also wants to control the world.  A third character - Roark, a Christ figure - just wants to put up some nice buildings but is attacked at every turn by corrupt gangsters.  They all want to sleep with Dominique Francon, a thin and beautiful (what else?) social critic.  When these supermen clash over the fate of the world, you think something pretty dramatic is going to happen.  In fact, nothing much does.  The losers drift away, diminished, and the last man standing gets the girl.    As others have noted, the dialogue in the book is not believable.  Rand is nothing if not preachy, and her characters don't talk to one another, they make speeches to one another.  Because of its defects as fiction, The Fountainhead can only stand as a book of ideas, and even Rand's ideas are not presented very attractively.  In the New American Library edition, there are 15 pages of end material that apparently were included to try to present her philosophy in a more persuasive fashion than she does in the novel.  Rand is an atheist and sees no reason for people to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others: in fact, selfishness is good, since each individual human life is an end in itself.   Most people have at least some libertarian leanings and so will find some superficial appeal in her ideas.  But there isnothing of lasting value here.  Who can believe that there is no higher purpose or meaning in life than pleasing oneself?	2005-01-15

Through fortuitous circumstances she meets Maxim de Winter, a wealthy widower and master of Manderley, a grand country house on England's coast.  When this young lady - we never learn her name - enters de Winter's world, she is inevitably compared to Rebecca, de Winter's former wife.  These comparisons, and the social demands placed on her in de Winter's world, accentuate her natural anxiety to the point that she begins to consider suicide.  At the same time, a maritime accident reveals much about de Winter, Rebecca, and Manderley itself.<br /><br />This novel explores some popular themes, like the troubles of fabulously wealthy people.  But popularity does not in this case imply mediocrity.  Du Maurier has created some wonderful characters, including the nameless protagonist, who is surely the heroine of shy people everywhere.  She also offers some pretty good plot surprises.  Finally, and very importantly for me, she offers some nice scenes of English domesticity (shaking off the water after a walk in the rain, reading the papers in front of the fire, having tea in the library, and so on).  Rebecca might be summer reading, but it is good summer reading.	2004-12-28

Scott Fitzgerald's semi-autobiographical coming of age novel, celebrates the intensely felt victories and defeats of a privileged young man.  The son of rich wastrels, Amory Blaine is convinced of his physical and intellectual superiority from a young age.  He attends prep school in Connecticut, where he meets others of his class and learns how to impress them.  He then moves on to Princeton, and here Fitzgerald shares with the reader a lengthy appreciation of what the school offers: tradition, a challenge, and the company of other talented young men from the ruling class.  The story takes a brief hiatus when Blaine goes to war, which characteristically he interprets in terms of how it affects him. On returning home, he has a painful love affair that helps mature him. <br /> <br />Blaine is not a very sympathetic protagonist - he is selfish and unkind - but to his credit he doesn't pretend to be anything other than what he is.  Also to his credit, he is sensitive to beauty everywhere, and he can see merit in others.  Through his eyes, we meet a number of friends and lovers, and there are some remarkable characters among them. <br /> <br />Fitzgerald is a wonderful writer, and in this, his first novel, he seems at pains to prove it by extensively using poetry, letters between his characters, and the dramatic form to help tell his story.  He does indeed seem very comfortable in all of these forms.  Fitzgerald went on to write great books, and this one shows the impressive skills he had even as a young man of 24. <br />	2004-12-18

The author, Nobel laureate Douglass North, concludes that the tension between gains from specialization and attendant costs is \\"the basic source of structure and change in economic history.\\"  Institutions arise to exploit the gains from division of labor or to reduce transaction costs.  This theory appears to offer considerable economy and power of explanation.   <br /> <br />North asserts that, in the prehistoric era, human population increase would lead to declining labor productivity as resources were exhausted.  New technologies could increase productivity but, if property rights were nonexclusive, as they must have been in a nomadic hunter-gatherer society, new technologies would simply accelerate resource depletion.  Only if a tribe or band could exclude rivals from exploiting the resource, as they could in a settled agricultural society, would the productivity gains from new technology be sustained.  The advantage that agriculture offered, then, was the opportunity to establish exclusive communal property rights.  This produced what North calls the first economic revolution. <br /> <br />The first economic revolution, occasioned by the rise of agriculture, produced the state, \\"the most fundamental achievement of the ancient world.\\"  The state specialized in providing security, keeping order within societies and protecting them from outside threats, while the complex demands of an agricultural economy  (compared to those of a hunter-gatherer economy) required increased specialization throughout the rest of society as well.  Over time, new military technologies led to larger states and more representative forms of government as rulers were forced to make concessions to their constituents to compete militarily with other rulers. <br /> <br />The industrial revolution, which North refers to as the second economic revolution, was largely a result of better specified and enforced property rights that raised the private returns to invention and led to an invention \\"industry.\\"  The industrial revolution brought tremendous gains in the standard of living but required new institutions to achieve gains from specialization without losing them to attendant transaction costs.  <br /> <br />North notes that transaction costs would be prohibitive without a normative system that encourages compliance with contractual obligations.  Accordingly, concurrent with the industrial revolution, we see a concerted effort by elites to inculcate the values of hard work, thrift, and sobriety among the working classes.  In fact, North has reflected deeply on the role of ideology in an industrial society.  Changes in knowledge and technology affect relative prices and thus affect perceptions of fairness.  Differences in occupation or geographic location also give rise to different perceptions of how output should be distributed.  \\"Ideological entrepreneurs\\" capitalize on these different perceptions.  Successful ideologies must provide an explanation of history that plausibly accounts for current conditions.  Ideologies must be flexible so that they can attract new adherents and accommodate changed conditions.  Most importantly, to effect change, successful ideologies must overcome the free rider problem.  Their ability to do so will be inversely related to the legitimacy of existing institutions.  <br /> <br />An interesting question asked early on in the book is, why do states persistently fail to establish property rights that would permit high rates of economic growth?  He explains that states first maximize returns for the ruler and then, subject to this constraint, try to reduce transaction costs throughout the economy.  Where the ruler is an individual or the representative of a small elite group, the interests of rulers will not normally coincide with those of society as a whole. <br /> <br />Structure and Change in Economic History offers considerable insight into fundamental historical forces.  It will come as no surprise to those who have read this work that North won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1993 for his use of economic theory and quantitative methods to explain economic and institutional change.   <br />	2004-12-03
US	52541763	R1L7CP8F3BM77D	069108677X	438003253	Global Political Economy: Understanding the International Economic Order	Books	4	16	17	N	Y	A Valuable Introduction to International Political Economy	Robert Gilpin's Global Political Economy: Understanding the International Economic Order delivers what it promises by giving readers an understanding of economic relations among nations.  Essentially, it is an introduction to the discipline of political economy, a survey of economic developments since World War II, and an analysis of the theories that compete to explain these developments.  As an introduction to the field, it is both accessible and comprehensive, but extensive footnotes and a select bibliography provide resources for advanced students. <br /> <br />Gilpin begins with a rather pessimistic assessment of his colleagues: economists, he says, have a suite of highly developed analytical methods and theoretical models that are seldom applicable.  Political scientists, on the other hand, rely essentially on intuition that is seldom informed by theory.  Political economy, of course, is an attempt to move past these limitations.  Political economists tend to study powerful economic actors who can influence prices.  Realists, like Gilpin, focus especially on state actors while recognizing the increasing influence of global investors, multinational corporations, and NGOs.  Political economists would take particular note that economies are embedded in social and political systems where the purposes of economic activity are decided.  One society may use its wealth to build a fairly egalitarian welfare state; another might use it to develop military might, and a third might concentrate wealth in the hands of a small elite. <br /> <br />One of the striking features of the international economy is that \\"free trade has historically been the exception and protection the rule,\\" even though the benefits of free trade have persuasive theoretical and empirical support.  Trade liberalization increases domestic competition, thus increasing efficiency and consumer choice.  It increases both domestic and global wealth through the gains from specialization, and it encourages the diffusion of new technology throughout the world.  Gilpin cites several reasons why, in the light of these benefits, protectionist ideologies usually hold sway.  First, while the principle of comparative advantage tells us that both parties to an exchange will benefit, one party may benefit more than the other, and nations can and do worry about relative benefits.  Second, economists support the use of protection for infant industries that can later become competitive.  Unfortunately, there is no way other than trial and error to identify these future winners, and temporary protection often becomes permanent.  Third, trade benefits do not accrue to all members of a society equally.  Fourth, trade creates interdependencies between nations, while nations try to preserve their autonomy and freedom of action. <br /> <br />Gilpin examines the problem of uneven development and, in particular, asks what role the state might play in accelerating development.  After an extended discussion of the debate over the \\"development state,\\" Gilpin concludes that states have an important role to play.  Development requires a transformation of society, and states can facilitate that transformation by investing in the health and education of their citizens, socializing them, and providing public goods like physical infrastructure and economic institutions.  There is also evidence that government investment in research and development has positive effects for domestic industry. <br /> <br />Gilpin also describes the \\"machinery\\" of the international monetary and finance system in detail.  All but the most expert of readers will find some new information here. <br /> <br />I have to say that I enjoyed this book tremendously.  Gilpin has an exciting story to tell, and he writes clearly, with a degree of elegance of expression and restraint.	2004-11-20

He is accompanied by Sal Paradise, his protg, for whom Moriarty can do no wrong.  The pair moves about in the lowest level of society, where there are many hard working people of modest means as well as a large number of criminals, alcoholics, and dope fiends. <br /> <br />One good thing about Moriarty and Paradise is that they are open to experience.  They want to feel things deeply, and they do, as in this scene where Paradise awakes at dawn after spending the night alone on a bench while trying to get home to New York: <br /> <br />\\"Isn't it true that you start your life a sweet child believing in everything under your father's roof?  Then comes the day of the Laodiceans, when you know you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, and with a visage of a gruesome grieving ghost you go shuddering through nightmare life.  I stumbled haggardly out of the station; I had no more control.  All I could see of the morning was a whiteness like the whiteness of the tomb.  I was starving to death.\\" <br /> <br />Generally, though, the boys are digging life, especially when they have been drinking heavily, which is almost always.  There are some very funny passages in this book, like the following one where Moriarty hurtles across the desert at top speed with some hitchhikers in the back seat: <br /> <br />\\"I wasn't scared at all; I knew Dean.  The people in the back seat were speechless.  In fact they were afraid to complain: God knew what Dean would do, they thought, if they should ever complain.  He balled right across the desert in this manner, demonstrating various ways of how not to drive, how his father used to drive jalopies, how great drivers made curves, how bad drivers hove over too far in the beginning and had to scramble at the curve's end, and so on.. . .\\"  <br /> <br />\\"I heard [the people in the back seat] whispering mutiny.  \\"We can't let him drive anymore, he's absolutely crazy, they must have let him out of an asylum or something.\\" <br /> <br />One flaw in the book is that Kerouac doesn't seem to be able to show how Moriarty changes and develops during the course of the book.  Instead, he just announces at various intervals that Moriarty has changed, announcements that are completely unsupported by the narrative.   <br /> <br />Still, this is a fun book to read and it has become a part of American mythology. <br />	2004-11-17

Drieser creates suspense early and maintains it, so this book, while lengthy, is a fast read.  I went to bed early at least a couple nights to read this book. <br /> <br />Clyde Griffiths is a young man \\"with a temperament that was as fluid and unstable as water.\\"  Raised in a poor family with narrow religious views, he quickly falls under the influence of an element with low morals and little education.  He is offered an opportunity to redeem himself, but wastes it.  At this point, the pace of the plot accelerates as he rushes toward destruction. <br /> <br />What is frightening in this book is what we have in common with the protagonist: Clyde wants power, and he wants to mate with the most desirable women available.  Perhaps he is more foolish than most of us would be in pursuing these goals, but few men have not made some of the same mistakes that Clyde makes. <br /> <br />A subordinate theme in the book is the marked difference in opportunities available to the privileged few versus the many in the pre-Depression, pre-New Deal United States.  A ruling caste, nourished by oligarchy, dominates the world that Clyde lives in, and those who are born outside of this elite group live circumscribed lives. <br /> <br />Another subordinate theme is the relationship between religion and morality.  Drieser harshly portrays the weak who fall back on religion for support, but Clyde's mother, who is intensely religious, is portrayed in more positive terms.  While she draws strength from her religion, she also brings her own strength.  In the conclusion, we find that she has matured and acquired perspective as a result of the events portrayed in the novel. <br /> <br />(I have a minor complaint about the Signet Classic edition: the inner margins of this book are so narrow that you almost need to break the binding to see the text nearest the spine.)	2004-09-13

They mature, as most of us do, they forgive one another, and they try to help one another when they can.  That's it.  That's what redeems them. <br /> <br />Alice Walker also knows how to write a dialect.  This book must get assigned an awful lot in English classes.	2004-09-13

His sensory equipment appears to have been marvelously sensitive, and he can recount convincingly the things that he touched and saw and smelled as a small boy.  He is attuned to the seasons, and much else at the same time: <br /> <br />\\"Yes, and in that month when Prosperpine comes back, and Ceres' dead heart rekindles, when all the woods are a tender smoky blur, and birds no bigger than a budding leaf dart through the singing trees, and when odorous tar comes spongy in the streets, and boys roll balls of it upon their tongues, and they are lumpy with tops and agated marbles; and there is blasting thunder in the night, and the soaking millionfooted rain, and one looks out at morning on a stormy sky, a broken wrack of cloud; and when the mountain boy brings water to his kinsmen laying fence, and as the wind snakes through the grasses hears far in the valley below the long wail of the whistle, and the faint clangor of a bell; and the blue great cup of the hills seems closer, nearer, for he had heard an inarticulate promise: he has been pierced by Spring, that sharp knife.\\" <br /> <br />That's just one example.  Seemingly few seasons pass without comment during the years spanned by this novel. <br /> <br />Wolfe is also attuned to character, and he writes at length about the members of his family and many of the people he knew during his boyhood in Asheville, North Carolina.  The father of Eugene Gant, the Wolfe character in the novel, is lionized as a \\"great man\\" with larger-than-life passions and appetites, including a lifelong thirst for alcohol.  His mother, a real estate speculator and boarding house operator, is described in rather unflattering terms, and a high school teacher eventually becomes Eugene's spiritual mother.  Wolfe gives carefully drawn accounts of his siblings as well, including Grover, \\"a gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the others in kind and quality,\\" who dies of typhoid when Eugene is a toddler.  His sister Mabel (Helen in the novel), with a great maternal nature, often cares for their father or for Eugene in the novel.  But it is his brother Ben, a kind man with a diamond-hard exterior, who has the closest bond with Eugene. <br /> <br />The plot takes us through the familiar events of a boy's life.  Many of these events are related with great wit; they are all written, in Wolfe's words \\"in innocence and nakedness of spirit.\\"  Anyone who has had a paper route will respond to Wolfe's accounts of prowling about the town in all seasons, on the job, before the rest of the world awakens.  From the other paper boys, he learns to smoke: <br /> <br />\\". . . in the sweet blue air of Spring, as he sloped down to his route, he came to know the beauty of Lady Nicotine, the delectable wraith who coiled into his brain, left her poignant breath in his young nostrils, her sharp kiss upon his mouth.\\" <br /> <br />At a tender age, Eugene goes off to college; he comes to know corruption and grief; he finds his way in the world.  In a climactic scene with his brother Ben, Eugene understands the meaning of his journey so far, but there is no resolution or end in sight.  The book leaves Eugene when he is 18, still an unformed man. <br />	2004-08-27

For Stone, politics is not an obstacle to good policy; it is \\"a creative and valuable feature of social existence.\\"  She has a very concrete understanding of what politics is: more than anything, a struggle over ideas. <br /> <br />Stone begins by providing a simple framework for defining policy issues: <br /> <br />1. Something is desirable. <br /> <br />2. We need it (or more of it). <br /> <br />3. How can we get it? <br /> <br />The rest of the book examines each element of this framework: goals, problems, and solutions.   <br /> <br />The theme of the chapters on goals is that parties to a political dispute are likely to contend over differing but equally plausible conceptions of abstract goals.  Stone examines differing conceptions of equity, efficiency, security, and liberty, and shows how these differences arise from different worldviews.  For example, some people judge fairness based on outcomes and others judge fairness based on attributes of distributive processes.  Another major difference in worldviews concerns how people view human nature.  Some people believe that humans are motivated to work primarily by need.  We need the lash of hunger to persuade us to assume the burden of work.  Others believe that humans have an innate desire to work and create that is inhibited by need.  They might say that the poor want to be more productive but are constrained by a lack of educational opportunities, socialization, adequate child care, and so on. <br /> <br />After examining goals, Stone looks at the political arguments that are used to mobilize support for policy initiatives: that is, the second element ofher policy framework.  Stone examines the use of symbols, statistics, ideas about causes of problems, the role of interests, and how people make political decisions.  Not too surprisingly, she finds that political decisions are not often rational ones. <br /> <br />In the last part of her book, Stone examines policy solutions: incentives, penalties, laws, and regulations, legal rights, indoctrination, and so on.  Her discussion of legal rights is a particularly valuable introduction to the law and rights in general. <br /> <br />It is possible to pick at Stone's treatment of some of these issues.  A few of her examples - for example, in her chapter on efficiency issues - appear to stretch a point to far, and in a few instances it seems that she is simply assigning complicated labels to well-known phenomena.  But similar criticisms could be leveled at almost any book on politics, and most of Stone's analytical concepts have considerable explanatory power. <br /> <br />Make no mistake: this book is far above the standard for the political science field.  It is also an entertaining read with many surprising insights.  I'm keeping my copy beside my desk. <br />	2004-07-25
US	52541763	RHZ73MFBZPRE2	0674695909	159499433	The Power of Public Ideas	Books	3	9	10	N	Y	The Power of Public Ideas	The dominant model of political behavior - pluralism - assumes that people are self-interested and uses economic behavior as an analogy for political behavior.  People organize themselves into groups to get their needs met, and these groups compete with one another to obtain rewards that are allocated through political processes.  The role of government is to make sure that political competition is fair and open - possibly helping weaker groups organize themselves and helping them acquire the skills to compete effectively.  The government will also provide public goods that cannot be provided through private market activity.  In sum, the government, will try to make sure that people (at least those who are organized) get what they want, as efficiently as possible.<br />After introducing this dominant model, Robert Reich, the editor of The Power of Public Ideas, delineates the situations where it might best be applied:<br />&quot;The prevailing philosophy comprises a useful set of precepts for guiding much of policy making, particularly where there is wide and enduring consensus about the nature of the problems to be solved, the range of possible solutions, and appropriate allocations of responsibility for solving them; and where solving the problems as understood is more useful than understanding them differently.  The prevailing philosophy is less helpful - indeed, may forestall social learning - where these conditions are not met.&quot;<br />Reich champions a different model; one that assumes that people are motivated, in their political lives, by what they think is good for society.  He cites some compelling evidence for this view: the civil rights movement, for example, can't be explained if politics is nothing more than self-interested competition among atomistic groups.  Moreover, citizens must feel some concern and consideration for one another, or massive coercion would be required to keep order.<br />Because Reich thinks people are basically public-spirited, rather than selfish, he sees involvement in politics as a good thing, almost as a good thing in itself.  For Reich, public deliberation strengthens public spirit in a type of virtuous spiral that makes society more durable.  In his view, then, a primary function of government is to stimulate public debate and deliberation.  New England-style town meetings would represent an ideal type of democratic government for him.<br />The objection to Reich's view, of course, is that people don't want to devote more time to politics.  Most people are political bystanders because they are broadly satisfied.  They can be aroused to action - to protest the Vietnam War, to demand civil rights for African Americans, to crack down on drunk drivers, and so on - when the government is unwilling or too slow to act on their concerns, or when their basic values or rights are infringed by the government.*  But would this be a good thing?  Those who are deeply dissatisfied with our society and seek transformational change would say yes.  Those who are broadly satisfied with the status quo would likely say no.<br />I read four of the ten essays in this volume.  Reich's introduction to the volume is covered above.  Gary Orren's \\"Beyond Self Interest\\" provides quite a bit of evidence to show that people often behave in public spirited ways.  It also critiques neoclassical economics and pluralism as models of behavior that allow government and leaders only a marginal role.  In fact, of course, at policy \\"turning points\\" they may play central roles.<br />Reich's \\"Policy Making in a Democracy\\" examines two approaches to governmental policy making: interest group intermediation and net benefit maximization.  In interest group intermediation, policymakers consider themselves successful if competing groups are placated.  In net benefit maximization, policy makers identify a market failure and decide that there is an opportunity to increase efficiency.  They typically use very sophisticated analytical techniques to propose a specific solution.  Reich believes that the latter approach has contaminated the former, so that groups who cannot offer sophisticated argumentation are excluded from much governmental decision-making.  As an alternative, he offers public deliberation.  He examines three cases where public deliberation was used and concludes that they were at least qualified successes.  Those who lack Reich's commitment to participatory politics will probably disagree.<br />\\"The Media and Public Deliberation,\\" by Martin Linsky, finds that the news media, with its emphasis on reporting on events rather than ideas, is an obstacle to public deliberation.  He makes some proposals for reform, some of which sound a bit silly.  However, many of his proposed approaches have already been used to some degree by the political monthlies and by news shows like The News Hour with Jim Lehrer.  For example, Linksy favors news coverage that presents contrasting opinions about an issue as this is likely to stimulate thought about alternative definitions of issues and approaches to solving them.  He also wants news organizations to \\"make news\\" by sponsoring debates and similar events.<br />Based on my admittedly limited exploration of The Power of Public Ideas, I concluded that it is a competently researched and written volume of essays from a moderate leftist orientation.  <br />* Carl Van Horn, Donald Baumer, and William Gormley, Jr., Politics and Public Policy, (Washington DC: CQ Press), 2001, 237, 238.	2004-07-17

These men are not terribly otherworldly and they are capable of enjoying good books, good wine, and good food.  They are tough guys too, up to the task of traveling thousands of miles on horseback or facing down some bad guys.  The religion they promote provides support and comfort to Mexicans, Indians, and some Anglo miners who need spiritual succor.<br />The book presents us with several vignettes in the lives of these urbane priests, as well as some fables and Southwestern folklore.  By living in harmony with God's law and the world he created, the men prosper.  Eventually, they must part, and they must grow old and die.  But death holds no horror for men like these who have spent their lives in service to others.<br />Cather's writing is beautiful and direct.  In the following passage, one of the priests and his friend spend several days traveling together:<br />As Father Latour and Eusabio approached Albuquerque, they occasionally fell in with company; Indians going to and fro on the long winding trails across the plain, or up into the Sandia mountains.  They had all of them the same quiet way of moving, whether their pace was swift or slow, and the same unobtrusive demeanor: an Indian wrapped in his bright blanket, seated upon his mule or walking beside it, moving through the pale new-budding sage-brush, winding among the sand waves, as if it were his business to pass unseen and unheard through a country awakening with spring.<br />North of Laguna two Zuni runners sped by them, going somewhere east on \\"Indian business.\\"  They saluted Eusabio by gestures with the open palm, but did not stop.  They coursed over the sand with the fleetness of young antelope, their bodies disappearing and reappearing among the sand dunes, like the shadows that eagles cast in their strong, unhurried flight.<br />Her book also contains some beautiful ideas.  In this passage, the two priests discuss Our Lady of Guadalupe:<br />\\"Where there is great love there are always miracles,\\" [Father Latour] said at length.  \\"One might almost say that an apparition is human vision corrected by divine love.  I do not see you as you really are, Joseph; I see you through my affection for you.  The Miracles of the Church seem to me to rest not so much upon faces or voices or healing power coming suddenly near to us from afar off, but upon our perceptions being made finer, so that for a moment our eyes can see and our ears can hear what is there about us always.\\"<br />This book has it all: fine writing, adventure, and some lessons for living.  Most highly recommended.	2004-07-10

The novel concerns a love triangle between a young man on an income, his fiancé, and the mysterious and independent Sarah.  <br />Throughout the novel, Fowles takes numerous opportunities to speak directly to the reader in asides that describe the process of writing fiction from an author's perspective.  Fowles also speaks directly to the reader to provide some historical information about the Victorians and their age.  These asides are enjoyable and make the characters seem less removed from our own time.<br />One quibble: the final resolution of the plot was a bit stilted (the characters basically stand up and explain themselves) and not very satisfying.  I'm still not sure I fully understand Sarah's motives.  The rest of this novel is very well done, though.	2004-06-24

In it, D. H. Lawrence considers the intellectual life and finds it arid and unreal.   (Here, there is an extended, unflattering discussion of the self-promotion that a successful writer must engage in.)  He then considers the effect of technology on modern life and finds that it has diminished our human qualities.  Finally, he advocates a return to a simpler life where people will meet their deeper needs rather than seeking the superficial things that money can buy.  The author thinks that sex has to play a pretty central role in a complete life, and he's probably right about that, but he has some very specific ideas about sex that sound odd to us now.   <br />The author also looks deeply into the dynamics of relationships between men and women and explores what we are like, why we have trouble understanding one another, and how men and women can complement one another.  <br />Finally, there is a fair amount of racy language and action that, of course, earned this book its notoriety.<br />I enjoyed this book a great deal and I think that the author's critique of modern ethics deserves some attention.  It is a mistake to dismiss this book because of its overtly sexual themes.	2004-06-05

At a higher level, it is about connections between people: indeed, the book opens with the following quotation from John Donne:<br />. . . any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. <br />Hemingway takes us inside a guerilla band during the Spanish Civil War, mostly through the eyes of Robert Jordan, an American professor-cum-demolitions expert.  Jordan is a Communist - at least he is strongly drawn to Communism - who has come to Spain to fight fascism.  He has character and a sense of duty.  Since, from our vantage point, at the beginning of the 21st century, it seems that not many people do, this gives the book a kind of \\"long ago and far away\\" feel.  Readers in 1940, when the book was published, no doubt experienced it in a more immediate way.<br />This book includes many memorable secondary characters: among them Pilar, the wise leader of the band of partisans, Pablo, her drunken, amoral, but capable husband, and Maria, the love interest in the story.  <br />Like every Hemingway novel that I've read, this one is well written.  Hemingway uses the archaic English \\"thou\\" for the Spanish \\"tu\\" and translates literally from Spanish to English to better convey an impression of Spanish dialogue to English readers.  These devices are initially distracting but are actually very successful at taking the reader inside the minds of the Spanish-speaking characters in this book.<br />This is a distinguished work and an exciting one.  It deserves its acclaim.	2004-05-30

Unfortunately, the book doesn't make much sense.  When Edna, the protagonist, casts away her public self to become her true self, we might suppose that her quality of life would improve.  Instead she exercises poorer and poorer judgment, ultimately destroying herself.  Edna is not a likeable or even an authentic character, and the supporting cast is almost as unattractive.

In Song of Solomon, Toni Morrison takes the view - a common one - that we have to know our history to know ourselves.  I don't really agree but in this case it makes a great story.  The characters in her novel don't make calculations or follow strategies: they do what they have to do.  The history that motivates their actions is an emotional, personal one.  Morrison's preoccupation with this personal history is reflected in her use of unusual names: names that are given \\"from yearnings, gestures, flaws, events, mistakes, weaknesses . . . Macon Dead, Sing Byrd, Crowell Byrd, Pilate, Reba, Hagar, Magdalene, First Corinthians, Milkman, Guitar . . . .\\"  Her characters are powerful, larger-than-life people, and clashes between them quickly escalate to life-and-death struggles.  At the same time, they have a great capacity for empathy and self-sacrifice.  Highly recommended.	2004-05-16

The central event in Billy's life is the firebombing of Dresden, Germany, an event he witnesses with little emotion.  Billy has the sense to cry when he sees a pair of horses suffering but he is unnaturally passive in war, in his marriage, in raising his son, in being kidnapped and taken to the planet of Tralfamadore, and so on.  From his experiences on Tralfamadore, Billy comes to perceive time in a different way that is very comforting to him and perhaps to Vonnegut as well.<br />First published in 1969, Slaughterhouse-Five has an experimental feel to it.  Billy's time travel leads to some unconventional juxtaposition of scenes, and Vonnegut makes frequent use of asides to the reader to tell us about himself and why he wrote the book.  Tragic events are described in flat, emotionless terms.  <br />Slaughterhouse-Five is a quick and entertaining read, and it educates the reader about the horrors of bombing directed against civilians.  Because of the flat tone, though, and because the characters are so unattractive, there doesn't seem to be much of a message here except to say that men are fools.	2004-05-01

It presents a very realistic and persuasive account of how Oskar Schindler placed himself at great risk (he was arrested three times) to oppose the Nazi regime and protect the Jewish workers in his factory.  The book also describes the subhuman treatment of those that Schindler could not save.  <br />Most of those reading this brief review will have seen the movie and it must be said that the book does not have quite the impact of the movie.

Each of these types of freedoms reinforce one another and contribute to outcomes such as higher incomes, better health, and longevity.  Sen quotes Peter Bauer, an iconoclast in the development field, as saying that &quot;I regard the extension of the range of choice, that is, an increase in the range of effective alternatives open to the people, as the principle objective and criterion of economic development; and I judge a measure principally by its probable effects on the range of alternatives open to individuals.&quot;<br />Sen points out that markets are not simply a means to an end but rather a fundamental freedom.  All people want to enter into exchanges with others, and this is how people everywhere behave unless they are prevented from doing so.  Sen shows that markets are not an expression of rapacious self-interest but rather are dependent on virtues such as trust and rectitude.  Seen in this light, market exchanges are an expression of deep human needs.  Yet Sen realizes that markets have limitations and he argues for non-market decisions to optimally provide for education, health care, protection of the environment, and prevention of the grossest inequalities in income distribution.<br />As an illustration of the interrelationships between the different types of freedoms, and between these freedoms and economic outcomes, Sen explains the Asian economic crises of the late 1990s as partly a result of a lack of transparency: that is, a lack of public participation in reviewing financial and business arrangements.  Had they been able to, members of the public likely would have demanded greater transparency and the crises might have been averted; however, authoritarian political arrangements prevented effective demands for transparency.  And, once the crises struck, the response of governments in the region was inadequate.  Had these governments been democratically accountable, they would have responded more quickly and forcefully to boost employment and otherwise cushion the impact of the crises on the poorest members of their societies.<br />Sen, the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in economic science, has aimed this work at a general audience.  For specialists, though, the book offers an extended discussion of methodological issues introduced by Sen's view of development as freedom, more than 50 pages of end notes, and an index of names and subjects.  This book will be an adventure for readers interested in the greatest problem us at the outset of the 21st century: how can the poorest people in the world live better lives?	2004-04-04

His health almost ruined, suffering from unbearable knowledge of the crimes committed in the camps,  Levi re-enters the world to find that it has been turned upside down by the war.  Improbably - he explains in an afterword that it is not in his nature to hate - he finds in himself a capacity to see the world afresh, almost as a child would.  <br />In the rest of the book, we accompany Levi and his companions on a picaresque through postwar Europe and Russia as they try to make their way back to their native Italy.  While their sufferings are legion, Levi takes great pleasure in food, in his fellow man, and in nature.  In particular, he displays a fine appreciation for the absurdities visited on the refugees by their well-intentioned but inept Russian rescuers.<br />This book is an entertaining read.

Whereas the cold war system ordered the world by dividing it and building barriers, globalization involves integration and breaking down barriers to allow free markets to operate more efficiently.<br />While Friedman sees what globalization has to offer, he also sees why it has vocal detractors.   Globalization is driven by the aspirations of many to improve their standards of living.  These supporters see the free market ideology of globalization as offering faster improvements than the relatively corrupt and static political systems that dominate their own countries.  Yet, globalization alienates many others: it takes power away from political elites, it hurts countries and individuals that cannot adapt quickly to market demands, and it contributes to a homogenization of culture.<br />Friedman makes prescriptions to reduce some of globalization's ill effects, and to help protect the environment from the type of short-sighted exploitation that free market systems may encourage.  These prescriptions are not the strongest part of the book, in my opinion.  At best, I see his prescriptions as ideas that could gain some traction in the mid- to long-term future, after the material well-being of people in the developing countries has sufficiently advanced.  There is a hierarchy of human needs, and people who are not adequately fed or sheltered will not of their own volition sacrifice material progress for culture or for the environment. <br />Friedman is an engaging writer with great sympathy for the people he writes about.  As his other book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, also shows, he is also a great explainer of complex phenomena, without tending toward oversimplification.  This is an indispensable book for those who want to understand globalization.	2004-01-27

The protagonist, formerly a self-controlled and respectable public figure, gives himself over to obsessively stalking a 14-year-old boy for whom he has erotic feelings.   While these feelings would be unacceptable to most people in our era, it is still difficult for us to appreciate the degree of condemnation they would have attracted when this story was written.  Yet, Sigmund Freud had published The Interpretation of Dreams a decade earlier, and German intellectuals like Thomas Mann were aware that censurable urges lurk beneath conscious notice within all of us.  Through this story, the author was surely struggling to come to terms with his own homoerotic urges.  Judging from what he wrote, these were deeply troubling to him: corruption, decay, and condemnation are the themes he presents to us.  While the images conveyed through this story are repugnant and shocking, the writing is beautiful and affecting.<br />Several of the other stories in this volume are of similar quality, and similarly deal with troubling themes (\\"Mario and the Magician,\\" \\"The Blood of the Walsungs\\").  Yet, Mann was also capable of an extended and sincerely felt appreciation of the more benign and wholesome aspects of our world (\\"A Man and His Dog\\").  <br />These stories are worth reading and re-reading.  Thomas Mann won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, and these stories, if not Nobel prize quality, at the very least show Mann to be an engaging and entertaining writer.	2003-11-08

The best I can say about it is that occasionally - and I mean once every hundred pages or so - it makes an acute observation about human nature, war, or bureaucracy.  The satire in the rest of the book is too broad to be either funny or wise, and there is nothing here to make us care about the characters or what happens to them.	2003-10-25

He offers deep - I would say profound -  support for his views, but not proof.  He offers one interpretation of the meaning of life's mysteries but not the only possible interpretation.<br />Niebuhr begins by arguing that the Christian view of man's nature, compared with alternative views, is more complete and offers more explanatory power.  According to the Christian view, man is made in the image of God.  Unlike alternative views that establish a good/bad duality between mind and body, in the Christian view, both mind and body are good because both are created by God.  Man is made to live in harmony with others and God's will but violates this harmony when he - inevitably - makes himself the center and source of meaning for his life.<br />Man has tremendous creative and imaginative powers, and his mind can transcend both itself (since he can make his own thoughts the object of contemplation) and the natural world (since he can manipulate natural forces to create new possibilities and vitalities of nature).   Because man cannot find ultimate meaning in what he can transcend, he cannot find ultimate meaning within himself or in the natural world.  This is why we turn to religion.<br />Christianity is a religion of revelation, meaning that Christians believe that God must speak to us in order for us to arrive at a correct understanding of his nature and will.  If the Bible is to be believed, God spoke to man throughout history but his message was not clearly understood.  Because of our misunderstanding, and because God's law is so radically different from man's law, Jesus' message was highly offensive to his listeners.  What Jesus told us is that God overcomes evil not by destroying evildoers but by taking their evil upon himself.  God's love is suffering love.<br />To live in accordance with the law of love seems to require that we accept the reality of an existence beyond this life.  If the reality of this other existence is denied, then Jesus' statement that \\"whoever loses his life for my sake will find it\\" makes no sense.<br />Yet, we are not to despise this life.  To be righteous, to a Christian, means to serve others, and we need to strive after intermediate and partial arrangements that help point the way toward ultimate resolutions and revelations.  God provides ultimate meaning.  Just as the human mind can provide meaning to a sequence of chronological events by comprehending them all in an instant, so God provides meaning by comprehending all events both prospectively and retrospectively.<br />This poor summary of what Niebuhr has to say on the largest subjects makes it sound as if this is a very otherworldly book.  It is not.  The book contains a great deal of keen observation of human behavior and current events at the outset of World War II, and Niebuhr later became extremely influential in the U.S. State Department.  Niebuhr's  observations on politics and social justice still speak to us with great immediacy.	2003-10-25

It presents an extremely rigorous and effective fitness program that uses no weights.  The program provides a lot of variety and the workouts are fun.  They are also very, very difficult.  But if you stick with the program you are going to see some pretty stunning results, both physical and mental.  And that's a promise.<br />A bonus is that you will laugh out loud several times when you first read through the exercises and when you read about what real Navy Seal training is like.<br />After running through this program a couple times, anything will seem possible to you.  That's something you can't put a price on, and I think that Stewart Smith has done us a great service by writing this book.	2003-04-14

This introduction to the subject is accessible to any reader, even those with very limited previous knowledge of economics.  The book begins with a critical summary of current development theories and then takes on a number of policy questions, with case studies.  Each chapter ends with discussion questions and the publisher maintains a web site with useful quantitative and graphing exercises (with answers).<br />Michael Todaro writes from a left-of-center perspective and is more ideological than most textbook writers.  However, he presents other points of view and presents them pretty fairly in my opinion.  And I have to say that he scores some pretty big points against the neoclassical theorists by showing that their assumptions are frequently at odds with reality.  <br />While some of Todaro's more stridently ideological statements can be annoying, I know of no other book that provides such a comprehensive, well organized, and engagingly written introduction to economic development.	2003-04-13

The protagonist, Bjartur of Summerhouses, is an obstinate, reactionary, and sometimes cruel herdsman who nonetheless possesses fine perception.  Through this book, we learn a lot about the ecology of Iceland (it's a nice place to visit but don't try to raise sheep there), Bjartur, his family, and the society he belongs to.  Author Halldor Laxness makes you appreciate the difficulties these people face but can also make you laugh out loud when he satirizes Bjartur's neighbors and the local gentry.  I was impressed with this book and read many passages to my family.  Unfortunately, there are also parts of the book where not much of interest happens for what seems like 50 or 75 pages at a time.  I'm tempted to say that this would have been a better book if it were shorter but then Laxness won the Nobel Prize for literature and I didn't.	2002-11-11

It is not a biography of King per se but Taylor Branch has a lot to say about how King, through personal effort, became a great leader.  King was, of course, a great orator, and Branch is pretty adept at analyzing his methods.  But almost anyone who has heard King or read him knows that he was channeling something greater than himself.<br />What King wanted for himself was a life of scholarship.  Yet, as Jesus said on the Mount of Olives, \\"not my will, but yours be done.\\"  In a brilliant anecdote, Branch relates how King was elected, almost accidentally, to head the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  At a mass meeting that evening, King gave an inspired speech.  At the end of the speech, the audience sat, stunned.  People reached out to touch him as he left the building.  \\"[King] would work on his timing, but his oratory had just made him forever a public person. . . . He was twenty-six, and had not quite twelve years and four months to live.\\"  The obstacles in Montgomery in 1955 were many, and only a few weeks passed before King sat in despair, his face buried in his hands.  He prayed, saying \\"I've come to the point where I can't face it alone.\\"  As he spoke these words, he experienced a transcendent religious experience that gave him the strength to continue his struggle.  No man is perfect, but King knew his duty, and did it.<br />Beyond its insights into King's character, this book offers readers a survey of our country at a critical juncture.  When the civil rights movement began, the balance of interests in the United States had left the South in the grip of the great evil of segregation.  King himself shifted the balance.  At the same time, thousands of ordinary Americans, devoted to nonviolent struggle, suffered tremendous privation, loss of livelihood, beatings, and sometimes death, making it impossible for the federal government to ignore the plight of Southern blacks.  <br />Finally, through Branch's history, we meet a large number of what could almost be called interesting minor figures except that they were not minor at all.  One of these is Vernon Johns, a brilliant farmer-preacher who preached the social gospel.  In a memorable scene, Johns is asked to address a group of white and black preachers who are meeting to discuss the role of the church during a time of racial tension.  He says, \\"The thing that disappoints me about the Southern white church is that it spends all of its time dealing with Jesus after the cross, instead of dealing with Jesus before the cross. . . . If that were the heart of Christianity, all God had to do was drop him down on Friday, let them kill him, and then yank him up again on Easter Sunday.  That's all you hear.  You don't hear so much about his three years of teaching that man's religion is revealed in the love of his fellow man.  He who says he loves God and hates his fellow man is a liar, and the truth is not in him.  That is what offended the leaders of Jesus's own established religion as well as the colonial authorities from Rome.  That's why they put him up there. . . . I want to deal with Jesus before the cross.  I don't give a damn what happened to him after the cross.\\"  At this point, no one's too happy that they invited Johns to speak.  Lest we think that Johns was just an eccentric, though, Branch also refers us to Johns' \\"Transfigured Moments,\\" which can be found on the web and shows Johns to be a serious man of considerable understanding and imagination.<br />In addition to its merit as history, Parting the Waters is a great read, and deserves to be read slowly.  If you can do this, the time you spend with this 900-plus-page book will be extremely rewarding.	2002-11-05
US	52541763	R2ZZ3KEJALU88A	014018998X	552921765	The Souls of Black Folk (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	0	1	N	Y	Outstanding Analysis, Outstanding Writing, But Short	This collection of essays by W.E.B. Du Bois, first published in 1903, persuasively explains how the reconstruction period shaped the subsequent experience of African-Americans.  Blacks were freed, unprepared, into a hostile society.  With more funds and a wider mandate, the Freedman's Bureau could have solved many of the resulting problems.  Instead, the Freedman's Bureau was abolished in favor of black suffrage, which, it was thought, would make the freed slaves their own guardians through the power of the ballot.  The original vision of \\"forty acres and a mule\\" was never achieved or even approached.<br />Du Bois argues his points moderately but with great power.  Slavery in the United States was \\"not the worst slavery in the world, not a slavery that made all life unbearable, rather a slavery that had here and there something of kindliness, fidelity, and happiness, - but withal slavery, which so far as human aspiration and desert were concerned, classed the black man and the ox together.\\"  He recognized that \\"The present generation of Southerners are not responsible for the past, and they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it.\\"<br />Long passages of the book, for example, \\"Of the Black Belt,\\" report on the diverse condition of blacks in the United States, differences that he would no doubt ascribe to differences in intelligence, energy, perseverance, foresight, and thrift.  But Du Bois took strong issue with those who, in his view, took the degradation of blacks in the United States as evidence of their inferiority.  A closing passage in \\"Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\\" seeks to replace dangerous half truths with supplementary truths.  He points out that slavery and racial prejudice were potent if not sufficient causes of the position of black Americans at the end of the reconstruction period.  He acknowledges that \\"while it is a great truth to say that the Negro must strive and strive mightily to help himself, it is equally true that unless his striving be not merely seconded, but rather aroused and encouraged, by the initiative of the richer and wiser environing group, he cannot hope for great success.\\"  In other words, whites have tended to \\"shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation . . . .\\"  In fact, Du Bois reminds us, the problem of race in the United States is \\"a concrete test of the underlying principles of the great republic . . . .\\"<br />While Du Bois' contributions to discussions of racial problems are extremely formidable, it is striking how much of the value of this book has nothing to do with race whatsoever.  Perhaps its greatest value is to remind us of what a fine, fine thing a man can be: broad-minded, courageous, passionate, and a lover of truth and fairness.<br />The Dover Thrift Edition is highly recommended.	2002-09-12

While students in &quot;soft&quot; majors are the primary intended audience, math majors and others who have already progressed beyond the introductory level are likely to find this book of great interest as well.<br />The book gives readers a good feel for the variety of problems that mathematicians tackle.  In fact, one of the book's great strengths is the range of topics it covers, from number theory and games, to topology, to chaos and fractals.  It does this with little use of conventional mathematical notation or jargon, and the level of presentation is so elementary that the book can be &quot;read&quot; just as any non-technical book can be read.  At the same time, the authors go to great lengths to encourage reader participation.  Many hands-on demonstrations and experiments are provided, and the end-of-chapter exercises ask readers to discuss the material with others and write about their experiences.<br />The topics presented are fascinating.  I read this book on my vacation and found several passages to read to my wife and daughter almost every day.  (This provided a lot of amusement for everyone when my 12-year-old daughter would solve problems in a few seconds that I had been pondering without much success.)<br />The book's subtitle is &quot;An Invitation to Effective Thinking,&quot; and the authors present problem-solving strategies that can be applied to problems within and outside the field of mathematics.  While readers will no doubt be familiar with many of them already, it is difficult for me to imagine anyone who would not benefit from at least some of the strategies presented.<br />The authors' writing is very informal with a lot of corny humor - possibly too much for a lot of people - but at the same time you do get a sense of the authors as good guys who know some important things and want to share the wealth.<br />In summary,this is a most unusual and stimulating book.  Highly recommended.	2002-07-21

The author writes in what I have to call the \\"un-masking\\" tradition, in which a writer examines an almost universally accepted world view and reveals it to be false.  Unlike most writers in this tradition, who tear down false paradigms but leave little of value in their place, Lomborg has a charitable and humanitarian message.  <br />Lomborg examines a wide range of phenomena - food and hunger, deforestation, air pollution, and water pollution, for example - and usually finds that our current policies are working.  They may not be working as fast as we would like, and it would be inappropriate to feel complacent, but, contrary to what we are told by the media and some environmental groups, we have identified approaches to environmental problems that are successful and are working.  The author is careful not to overstate his case, and there are many exceptions to the highly simplified conclusion that I've described above.  One major exception is that, while the developed countries can afford to address their environmental problems and are doing so, the developing countries face the more pressing problem of crushing poverty.  <br />In Lomborg's view, this problem - poverty in the developing countries - is the principal problem facing the world.  Accordingly, our principal objective must be to create wealth in these countries.  Creating wealth in the developing countries will help their people live longer, healthier, more fulfilling lives.  And, once these basic needs are met, the developing countries will turn their attention and resources to environmental issues as the developed countries did in the last quarter of the 20th century.<br />There is much more than this to Lomborg's finely detailed examination of the true state of the world.  His book, while polemical, is carefully researched and argued.  Lomborg's presentation is engaging and the book is visually attractive.  This is probably the most rigorous book Ihave ever read by a political scientist and it enhanced my appreciation for what Lomborg's profession can offer us.	2002-06-29

During the course of his adventures, he learns a lot about the world, or says he does, but he's not good at applying what he learns to his own life, and he ends up in about as big a mess as he begins in.  This is a little disappointing, but Auggie is not that sympathetic a character, so it's not as disappointing as it might be.<br />We learn a lot too.  Saul Bellow studied sociology and anthropology, and he tells us a thing or two about the poor, and people who are down on their luck.  At one point, Einhorn, Auggie's mentor, tells him: &quot;Young fellows brought up in bad luck, like you, are naturals to keep the jails filled - the reformatories, all the institutions.  What the state orders bread and beans long in advance for.  It knows there's an element that can be depended on to come behind bars to eat it.&quot;  Similarly informative passages, about business, love, the training of wild animals, etc., can be found by opening the book at random to almost any page.  (In fairness, a good part of what's said is over-generalization or just not true, but still you're going to leave this book feeling pretty impressed by what the author knows.)<br />So why not five stars?  For one thing, the writing doesn't exactly propel you from one page to the next.  For another, the book is not very uplifting.  You've heard of Man's Search for Meaning?  This book comes very close to telling us that there isn't any.  That's pretty hard to take.	2002-02-22
