A play can have brilliant actors, brilliant sets and a brilliant director, but if the script is no good the play isn't worth a [darn].<br />It's much the same with Catcher In The Rye. One can posit all this book's themes as brilliant: The story of a boy beaten down by society, draining away in its downward spiral. The purity/innocnece/cutting genius of youth. Emptiness, running on a hampster wheel with nowhere to go. Wandering, lost in society's black hole. The death of being bourgeois. Society's turning of a boy with potential into a hopeless boy, searching for meaning in a world with none. The hypocrisy of labeling everyone a fake while being a massive fake oneself.<br />These are all great themes, but the bottom line is this: they're worth nothing if not presented properly, and Catcher is just not a good book. It packages all the above themes poorly; one feels as if one is running on that same hampster wheel as Holden with each sucessive page turn. Some might say that's part of the book's genius -it makes one feel exactly as its main character feels- but feeling that a book is pointless as one reads it just doens't inspire one to continue. Ultimately, this book does not deliver.	2002-09-17

As a book, this quirky but very realistic story works brilliantly. The top five lists liberally desposited throughout the book fit with the style, the characters make sense and all of them work well within this book's parameters. However, everything is lost in the translation to film. What is quirky and entertaining in the book is corny and badly done in the movie; what amuses and tweaks the mind of a reader turns off on the moviescreen. <br />Ultimately this book is a character study of its protagonist, Rob, and his search for happiness. Music is paramount to him, and everything revolves around it for him. This strains his relationship with Laura, his girlfriend and ultimately contributes to that relationship's demise. The book takes you into Rob's head, and into the head of the average 20-30something single man, with the noteable exception that most 20-30something single men don't make lists such as Top 5 80s Movies With Molly Ringwald! Overall, this is a very good read, and a very bad movie.	2002-08-31

What I discovered was a well-written, intelligent book, more in the vein of a scientific discovery than anything else.<br />When Jane Goodall (no, not the monkey scientist) is dumped by her boyfriend Ray two weeks prior to cohabitation and forced to move in with a womanizing coworker, she sees the male psyche from a whole new angle. This leads to a passionate, almost unhealthy obsession with the mating habits of male animals. She sees their habits as an almost direct parallell to the behavior of human men. Her obsession is presented in the form of wild-eyed rantings at her best friend Joan, and descriptions of the noteboks she fills obsessively.<br />What this book is at heart is a presentation of theories. It is funny, educational, and written in the most creative manner I've seen recently. Overall, very good, and very worth the time.	2002-01-06

Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, was heretofore referred to in the Bible in only one chapter, which tells the story of her trip to Shechem and subsequent affair with Shalem, one of its nobles. It is a brutal, violent passage (Genesis 24, I think) and not very pleasent. This book is an imaginative retelling of Dinah's story, from a what-might-have-happened perspective. <br />It begins with the story of her four mothers: Leah, her biological mother; Rachel, her aunt, who trains her for midwifery; Zilpah, referred to the in Bible as Rachel's handmaid; and Bilhah, referred to as Leah's handmaid. In this book, however, Zilpah and Bilhah are the biological sisters of Leah and Rachel, unacknowledged by their pig of a father, Laban. All these women are the wives of Jacob. It tells of their lives before Jacob, after Jacob, and up to Dinah's birth. At that point, the story shifts to her.<br />She is the only daughter of four women, the mothers of a combined eleven sons: Reuben, Simon, Levi, Naphtali, Issachar, Judah, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, although the last of the boys Dinah never knew. In a world so populated by men, Dinah's mothers pass their histories to her, including things she was too young to know. This book contains all that history in accompaniment and counterpoint to Dinah's own. When her history separates from theirs, however, it contains solely hers; it does not presume to know theirs. This book tells the &quot;true&quot; story of the events in Shechem. It is not much different from the Biblical account, but it tells the human story, with the true human emotinons so often lacking in the Bible.<br />That is one thing that is of note in this book: it never really deviates from scripture. That is, it doesn't alter what is written there. It exacerbates it, adds on to it, makes it more interesting, adds what it may have &quot;left out&quot; but never changes what is there. This is an excellent, very interesting, well-written book.	2001-12-08

I found it to be far better than Crown Duel. As opposed to the battle and war focus of the first one, this focused on the more human political plots and controversies occuring at court. I found it a lot more interesting and better written. This one contained mystery and controversy, had a deeper and more layered plot and yet still maintained very strong ties to the first book. It was an excellent follow-up to a not-so-excellent first book.	2001-12-05

Although not bad, it's not extremely memorable either.<br />This book imagines the story of the anonymous Girl With A Pearl Earring in Vermeer's famous painting of the same name. In the book, the girl is Griet, a newly hired maid in Vermeer's household. Griet is a well-drawn, sympathetic character whose emotions are clearly defined. Her struggles between Vermeer and Pieter, the butcher's son, as well as her more subsumed longing for a better and higher life, are easy to relate to. However, this book does not delve into the many layers of human emotion within Vermeer. Although probably written in partial to demonstrate his enigmatical existence, it is a bit of a letdown.<br />Overall, this is a nice, simple book that does not require you to think; it merely requires you to lose yourself in 17th-century Holland for a few days.	2001-11-23

To deny that would be less than intelligent to put it mildly. However, its humor can't save it from being ultimately pointless and something of a time-waster.<br />When you begin it, it seems very funny and accessible. The jokes about Vinnie and Gepetto, the constant usage of the phrase &quot;passing lesbian&quot; and the cat jokes are all funny. Truthfully, they never cease to be amusing, as do not the Jewish jokes. This book is amusing.<br />However, what little plot there is soon becomes tiresome. You don't care. And you can't care.

However, this is not her best.<br />This book is written as a journey of self-discovery, centered around Echo, a young girl growing up in the shadow of her goddess-like mother. Her life is spent trying to shed that shadow and become a person in her own right. The book interweaves chapters of Echo's life with chapters telling the stories of the main figures in her life. This is an interesting device that works here. <br />Something that more intense Block fans will notice is that the chapter of this book revovling around Echo's health obsession is drawn, sometimes verbatim, from Block's short story Blood Oranges.<br />Although good, this is not Block's best. If you're starting out, read Girl Goddess #9 or I Was A Teenage Fairy.	2001-11-19

Absolutley hilarious. This is a YA rewrite of Willis's terrific Ado, which can be found in Impossible Things. The basic concept is that censorship has reached such a height that people have injuctions against Shakespeare. When a high-school class tries to read Shakespeare, they do not know what hellish research lies in store.<br />Who's Gonna Rock Us Home?- By Nancy Springer. Very thought-provoking. It says some sobering things about socialism and the Ritalin generation, along with freaks and rebels. <br />Lose Now, Pay Later- By Carol Farley. Very reminiscient of Connie Willis. Funny with an interesting twist at the end.<br />If I Had The Wings of an Angel- By Joe Haldeman. Poignant. Good statement about growing up.<br />You Want It WHEN?- by Kara Dalkey. Hysterical, but one of those stories with an annoying time-travel angle that serves to do nothing but give a headache. Still, very good.<br />Ear- By Jane Yolen. Interesting....it feels as though the message is just out of reach, which I suppose is the draw. I just love it.<br />Free Day- By Peg Kerr. Sad. Sobering. Excellent.<br />Beggarman- By Susan Shwartz. Anyone who's ever been an outsider will see themselves in Jommy.<br />Old Glory- By Bruce Coville. Too painful to read more than once.

Anyone who has ever read that inimitable tome will know exactly what I mean. <br />Although the book is endowed with a charming and at times laugh-out-loud hysterical wit, Georgia herself proves to be an ultimately materialistic, fairly shallow and overdramatic protagonist. It is hard to work up sympathy for her when her biggest woes are the size of her nose and the fact that her crush has a girlfriend. Her parents, although a tad unreasonable, do not deserve the disgust she gives them. One often feels the need to slap her friends, and occasionally her.<br />Ultimately, this is a fun if not simple read. It can be knocked off in a few hours.

Although it could delve into multiple levels of human feeling and emotion, it does not; it presents an unfrilled, straight-up account of Linda's remarkable childhood without any decorations. The book seems to spin over the big things, not giving any signs of emotional depth in some of the events. Linda's emotions, which would have made this a truly fascinating book, are presented poorly if at all. Although her character is supposed to have low-to-average intelligence, this is pushing it.

Granted, it has the same descriptions of places you would kill to go to, but that's about where the similarities end.  This book is more of a gritty Y/A novel than a fantasy, ie Weetzie Bat. It's the story of Barbie, a young girl haunted by her burn-out was-model mother, who wants Barbie to be to be a model so badly, she will go to any lengths to ensure it. So along comes Mab, a pinkie-size fairy with fuschia hair, who is Barbie's best friend, guidance counselor and, on occasion, psychiatrist! She is the best part of a fantastic book.  Yes, I liked this book. I loved this book. I will read this book until the end of time!	2000-12-16

Absolutley, permanently hooked on anything and everything this genius had. I got The Crazy Horse Electric Game, expecting something akin to the books mentioned above, and I was sorely disappointed.  First of all, it was written in the third person, but it was present tense, so that was odd. Secondly, it took almost half the book for me to drum up a large amount of interest in this book. Thirdly, it just wasn't very good. <br />If you're a diehard Chris Crutcher fan, read this for posterity. And heck, it does get interesting eventually. But if you've never read anything by him before, then get Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes. It is a much better read.	2000-12-16

Chris is an interesting character and Lloyd is fairly interesting too. I haven't read this in a while, but I do recommend it for any longtime Zindel fan. Do not begin with this one, however; start with I Never Loved Your Mind or The Pigman.	2000-10-19

David and Della are fascinating people, although a bit  unbelievable. The story is gripping (I finished it in one day) and, in its  own way, suspenseful: as Della's past is brought to light, she begins to  slowly make sense, a great tactic. This is a book I will read many times.	2000-08-26
US	51009412	R3OXQSIZE8C88T	0553287656	331359422	A Begonia for Miss Applebaum	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Good, but a carbon copy	Although this book was good -it is almost thouroughly impossible to miss with Paul Zindel- it was very much like his most famous book, The Pigman.  In The Pigman, two high school friends, Paul and Lorraine, befriend an  extremely lonely elderly man and live out his last days with him. In A  Begonia for Miss Applebaum, two high school friends, Henry and Zelda,  become closer friends with their lonely elderly high school science  teacher. Both are good reads, but it was annoying to read the same book in  a different guise.<br />Overall, A Begonia for Miss Applebaum was a good book.  It was poignant, gentle and somewhat funny. However, the similarities to  The Pigman were so glaring that it interfered with the book.	2000-08-26

I was soon disillisioned, however. As  a major Paul Zindel fan (I'm currently working on reading every book and  play he has ever written) I can say that this does not stand up.  Immediatley after the first read, it's a great book, but in comparison with  Zindel's other fare it's just not as good. It's funny, but Eugene is  awfully slow as a character. Mahatma, his Indian friend, is a terrific  character who would stand up much better in another book. Regardless,  although this is a must for hardcore Zindel fans, someone just starting out  should really leave this until after I Never Loved Your Mind, To Take A  Dare and The Pigman .	2000-08-26

Although it's a fairly good story, the character of Mrs. Hunsdorfer doesn't stand up  without more background information, and Roth's psychosis is completely  implausible on the information given. However, it is thought-provoking,  mainly in that you try to figure out why on Earth Beatrice is as she is.  It's a fairly good quick read.	2000-08-26

The characters of Dewey and Yvette were completely plausible in the era in which the book was written, and the  story is excellant. Although it has to be read slowly and with a dictionary  (at times), it is utterly worth it. Great for first-time readers of Paul  Zindel.	2000-08-26

John and Lorraine are characters who  interact well with each other, and Mr. Pignati is quite believable as a sad  old man. However, beware: another great Paul Zindel book, A Begonia for  Miss Applebaum, is basically a carbon copy of this one, written post it.	2000-08-26

Thankfully, it was not a carbon copy of it, although it did include some o fthe same elements: a  lonely old man who the teens befriend. The conclusion involving John and  Lorraine is extremely satisfying for anyone who, like me, wanted more than  the last book provided.	2000-08-26

This book is plain fun, and it's very easy to relate to the character of Edna Shinglebox  (although, thank God, my parents are nothing like hers). Marsh is a very  interesting character, and the book is typical Zindel fare. It's a lot of  fun, and very, very interesting. It's a very good character study.	2000-08-26
US	51009412	R1OTLXRPAMZB43	0553273248	835646053	My Darling, My Hamburger	Books	2	3	7	N	N	Not too good	This book was more a series of sparse vignettes than an actual story. The  fact is, something will happen, and then on the next page it will have come  to a conclusion without any information on how that happened. The story  wasn't too good, and the characters were flimsy. Although Mr. Zndel is  generally a brilliant, brilliant writer, this book just did not measure up  to the standards it's being judged against. If you're looking for some real  Zindel, try I Never Loved Your Mind.	2000-08-26
US	51009412	R36HUM1X29V9W2	0553564366	165021414	Impossible Things	Books	5	6	8	N	N	Blew me away	This book contains eleven stories, which is the beginning of its downfall. It should have more like fifteen stories. However, the eleven contained herein are more than excellent, they are mindblowing.<br />My favorite would  have to be Spice Pogrom, one of the funniest and most absurd stories I've  ever read. Connie's homage to the screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's  is brilliant enough to make anyone want to rent one. Another brilliant, if  confusing story is the conclusion to this book: At the Rialto. Dumb blondes  of all shapes and sizes populate Connie's Hollywood, and their interaction  with quantum physicists is laugh-out-loud funny. In The Late Cretaceous,  although short, is a gem of a comedy story, with two subplots interwoven  through it. Time Out is also hilarious and multi-plotted, although all the  subplots resolve into one another in the end.<br />However, this book is not  all light fare. Several stories, such as Chance and The Last of the  Winnebagos, are extremely sobering and thought-provoking. Although I  enjoyed Chance, I doubt I will ever read it again; it was too sad. A simple  story of a housewife's dissatisfaction with her life is, to quote,  profoundly tragic as she reminisces about what might have been. The Last of  the Winnebagos, although not terribly sad, is enough of an ominous portent  to make anyone think twice.<br />The only truly forgettable story here is  Winter's Tale, Connie's contribution to the was-Shakespeare-Shakespeare  debate. Although her Old Englsih skills are impressive, they are the only  reason to read this poor story. All in all, however, this was a brilliant  book I will reread for a long time.	2000-07-03

You don't often see a book with the title Random Acts of Senseless Violence. Well, I'll tell you, it delivered.<br />The book centers around Lola, a twelve-year-old whose  family is forced to move to Harlem from midtown. Her transformation from  preppy to streetcrawler is fascinating and intriguing the only reason this  book doesn't get five stars is beacause it starts slow and the relationship  between Iz and Lola doesn't get developed enoguh for my taste.	2000-04-11

I read it in two days, and that's only because school (what a pesky little bugger) got in the way.<br />Love Story is one of the most beautiful things I have ever read. It doesn't have a lot of  elaborate details; however, that doesn't diminish its charm. It is  cuttingly funny, and completely absorbing. I read it on the lunch line,  during lunch, during math, during science...you get the picture. The ending  almost made me cry. This book is a work of art.	2000-03-24

I'd heard about Ayn Rand, and always wanted to check her out, so I read this. It absolutely left my jaw on the ground. It's such an incredibly moving, beautiful book. The main character, Equality 7-2521, is so easy to udnerstand and sympathise with. This book is a must-read for anyone who considers themselves even slightly  socially conscious.	2000-03-24
