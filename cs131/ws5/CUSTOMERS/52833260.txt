This is a nice little story.  It reads quickly and has a satisfactory ending.  I'd like to see a sequel and am looking forward to Kissing Frogs which I just ordered.<br /><br />For more paranormal romances, I would recommend Davidson's Undead and Unwed, and Undead and Unemployed.	2004-09-06

This excellent Kansas native has penned another winner in her continuing saga of Jane Jeffry and her neighbor Shelly.  This time the two embark on a gardening adventure which would not be complete without a little murder and mayhew in suburbia.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys curling up with an &quot;American&quot; cozy and a cup of tea on a dreary soon to be winter day.	2000-12-04

I was going to quit after fifteen pages, but then I gave it another shot.  It gets much better.  If you are into a chuckle from vampires, with a dash of grossness from the blood, this is for you.  It seems that there is an excellent set up for a sequel.	2000-11-24

Go back and find the first two in the series and enjoy them as well.  It's best to read them first, and then this one as there are many references to what has gone before.	2000-10-27

Most of the time I've been pleased.  This time, I am having a terrible time getting through the thing.  I checked out the other comments just now, and I agree with most of them.  I keep waiting for something exciting to happen, and I am still waiting.  I have tons of books waiting for me to have the time to read them and I am keeping them waiting for this?  Please bring back some excitement.  I am sure I could find a textbook that is more boring than this, but I hope I would be hardpressed to do so.<br />I hope the next Cornwell does not disappoint.	2000-10-27
US	52833260	R2H9FI4BCGLHEY	0892966890	72468624	Listen to the Silence (Sharon McCone Mysteries)	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Excellent, but	Okay, Sharon has always looked different from her brothers and sisters,  but when she asked, she's told that she looks like her great-grandmother.  Now she is going through her father's legal papers, and there in black and  white - adoption papers.  She goes off the deep end and starts a search for  her &quot;birth&quot; parents.  Her mother's worst fears appear to be  coming true, her daughter doesn't want her anymore.  That, of course, or  thankfully, turns out not to be true, but it seems to me that it would be  hardest on the adoptive parents who might see their child's search for a  birth parent as rejecting the love they have shared with the child for its  entire life.<br />The book is good, but as an adopted person myself, who has  chosen not to look for &quot;birth&quot; parents because I suspect it would  be too hard for my mother to accept, I think adopted children should be  told from the get go that they were chosen and then get on with the daily  part of living.<br />Anyway, read the book it is very well done.	2000-07-08
US	52833260	RMQNBDE8L5FCM	068486360X	125490883	Hot Springs	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Excellent reading	Whew - another great book from Stephen Hunter.  Earl Swagger is an interesting character.  This is of course, a prequel to the &quot;Bob the Nailer&quot; books which have come before - Dirty White Boys, Time to Hunt,  etc.  They are excellent.  Of course, you have to be ready to read and  imagine quite a bit of violence, but it works in these books.  Go ahead,  read this one first, and then go and find the ones that came before.  Now,  is the story of Earl's father to come later?  Sounds like a good idea to  me.	2000-07-05

This series is excellent.  Myron Bolitar is quite a character.  Win, Esperanza, Big Cyndi - all our extremely  interesting people.  Read all of these.  It helps if you start with the  first one and then follow through with the others.  I recommend that for  all series if you can find them.  Again, what a bummer, now I have to wait  a whole year for the next one.	2000-06-26

Now I have to wait another year for the next one.  Stephanie Plum and Grandma are a hoot.  Joe and Ranger are intriguing and the other  characters just add to the joy.  I recommend this series to all who enjoy a  good mystery.	2000-06-26

There are sixteen out now, I believe, and they the next four are sitting on the shelf waiting for me to get to them.  So many books, so little time but these are  worth it.<br />The Scottish highlands, the village of Lochduhb, the  villagers, and Hamish striding through them trying to keep the  &quot;small&quot; crimes in perspective and dealing with the murders that  crop up from time to time.  I miss Towser and hope that Hamish finds a new  friend soon.<br />I also hope that Priscilla and Hamish work out their  difficulties before too long, but then again, that might ruin the series.  Oh, well, I'll read and wait and see.<br />Again, please keep them coming.	2000-04-16
US	52833260	R1MBCBPS2QCKF5	0380977478	973201237	Kiss of the Bees	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A slow start, but worth it.	I always look forward to a new J. A. Jance and couldn't wait for this one.  It's pretty dark and doesn't really compare with J P Beaumont or JoAnna Brady series, but it is a good read.  It took a while for me to remember  the story line as the first book was published some time ago.  I do  recommend it to adults who enjoy the JA Jance books.  Read Hour of the  Hunter first and you won't have the slow start that I did.	2000-04-12

Marcus Didius Falco, what a character.  As if there aren't enough books to read set in modern times, there are excellent stories set in the past as well.  I buy these things and let them sit on the shelf and then when I  have the time to pick them up, I can't put them down.  If you enjoy  historical fiction and a good mystery story, read all of these, maybe skim  a few pages here and there, but enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.	2000-04-12

I found the first one when visiting in Atlanta, Georgia, and then was pleased to find more after I returned home.  The problems she does run into when peacefully trying to  pursue her career make for interesting stories.  I recommend Dressed to Die  to all mystery lovers and suggest you start with the first in the series.	2000-04-12

I read through several of the eighty some reviews of this books and agree with some and disagree with others.  I love this series and all the characters.  What's up with people who aren't interested in treecat  anatomy?  It's a fascinating subject and if you are any kind of reader,  skim what doesn't interest you and get on to the parts that do interest  you.<br />I agree that it is not for the first time reader.  Go back and start  at the beginning with On Basilisk Station and you will be hooked.  The plus  you will have is that you won't have to wait a whole year or more for the  next in the series to come out.  Of course, you will read the existing  books in the series in a short period of time, and then you will be left  waiting with the rest of us for the next in the series.	2000-04-12

I had just travelled through the deep south when I finally picked up the newest Nevada Barr.  I have been a faithful reader since Track of the Cat and have for the most part enjoyed following Anna Pigeon's  career throughout the country.  There have been some ups and some downs,  but this is a definite up.  Read it, read it, read it.  In fact read them  all.	2000-04-12
US	52833260	RKJV4NUTN9Y6A	0671720759	593817987	A Bad Spell In Yurt	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Good fantasy, and an easy read.	A wizard who manages to graduate from Wizard's School gets a job in a small kingdom far from the city.  It looks like a good job, but when he gets there the first thing he is asked to do, he hasn't a clue of how to  do.  He learns as he goes and finds that he can do what is asked of him.  He goes so far as to invent &quot;new&quot; magic because he didn't listen  as well as he should have in his classes.  As a teacher, I find that kind  of sad, but kind of hopeful in that those students who have potential can  overcome their lack of interest in education and find that their  instructors do know what they are talking about.  I have all the books in  the series and look forward to finding the time to read more of them.  So  many books and so little time, if it catches and holds my interest, it has  to be a good one.	2000-04-12

A brief explanation of what happens to plunge a chunk of West Virginia into 1632 and we're off and running.  I know enough about history to truly enjoy the  characters and the period.  I throughly enjoy the thought of what changes  would take place in Germany and the rest of Europe in their future.  I hope  there is a follow-up to show a world without the Franco-Prussian War,  Bismarck, the Wilhelms, Hitler, etc.  More please.	2000-04-12

I found this series almost exactly a year ago and have read them all.  Start with the first one Murder on a Girl's Night Out and read, read, read.	2000-04-12
US	52833260	R1S38VCPZ2DXOT	0446403393	286576195	Death of a Nag (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 11)	Books	5	13	14	N	N	Yes, yes, yes	Okay, I only picked up Death of a Glutton because I was caught out of the house without a book and had some wait time on my hands.  I owned everything else that interested me and Hamish Macbeth kept catching my eye.  I read it in less than a day and was hooked.  I now have the entire series  and just finished Death of a Nag last week.<br />I suppose this qualifies as  an &quot;English cozy&quot; even though it is in Scotland, but since I live  in Kansas I guess I'm not supposed to know there's much of a difference.  Scotland has technically been a part of &quot;England&quot; since the  1600's and of course they share the same island, but still there is the  hope that someday Scotland will be free?  Yes, and the south will rise  again, but back to the book.<br />Hamish is a complex man of great  simplicity.  Yes, he's a mooch, a bit of a poacher, but quite a good  sleuth.  I love his contacts with the rest of the world and how he puts  &quot;the touch&quot; on his relatives to help get the info he needs to  solve his cases.<br />The latest entry I've read, number 11, I believe, has  Hamish off on a well needed break from his beloved Lochdubh and the  irritation of of the villagers for his perceived misbehavior.<br />I must  admit the funeral scene and what lead up to it was a bit dismaying.  I hope  he finds a new &quot;friend&quot; with whom to share his life, and perhaps  he has, but has I said, I'm only up to #11 and the rest of the books are  sitting there waiting to be read so maybe he has done so already.<br />I  recommend you get the first one in the series, Death of a Gossip and go  from there.  There is a lot of background and build up of characters as the  series progresses.  I almost had to skip one of the books because it was  reportedly out of print, but I was able to find it on line and was glad I  did.  It helps to have access to all of the books when you start a series.  It helps to cut down on the wait time.<br />Read and enjoy	2000-04-12

She is a good speaker and an excellent author.  Her characters are rich and interesting.  A cleaning  service makes for a good background for a private detective. Her knowledge  of Atlanta and environs is enjoyable.  There's always room for a holiday  series.  I look forward to the next in line and recommend the series to all  mystery readers.	2000-04-12

I had a hard time getting into this series.  I bought one, made myself read it and then  didn't read another until Potter's Field which made me go back and read all  the ones I'd missed.  I couldn't believe Benton was murdered last time and  I feel that Kay should be able to deal with the situation in a better  manner than she has been doing.  I guess I don't want my fiction to mirror  reality quite so closely.  Don't deal lightly with tragedies, but don't  dwell on them either.  Deal with it and then get on with life - it doesn't  wait for you.<br />Any way - read this so you have the background to enjoy  the next one in the series which I hope will return to better days and more  intrigue.	1999-08-28

Clive Cussler means Dirk Pitt to me, so I picked up this volume with some hesitation, but since the forward has &quot;Dirk&quot; introducing the new characters I thought I would give it a  try.<br />This is a very entertaining read.  Austin and Zavala are fine  characters and I look forward to more on their backgrounds as this series  hopefully continues.  I am glad that it was set in Dirk's NUMA world and  that the whole gang was involved to some extent.  Keep up the good work.	1999-08-28

I do that a lot and always wonder why - I should have finished it right away, but there are too many books and way  too little time.  Anyway - READ THIS! READ THIS! READ THIS!<br />This is a  good story and a fine read.  If you still get to enjoy the summer pick up a  copy and enjoy. If you are at work, pick up a copy anyway and find the  time.  You won't regret it.	1999-08-28

Bill Slider and Atherton seem to be good police officers.  English mysteries are always a fun read because they put me in the mood to revisit the English countryside to spend  some time in a pub or to have high tea ata &quot;good&quot; hotel.  Since I  don't get to England very often, I pull out a Harrod-Eagles, or a Ann  Granger, or any number of other such books, fix a cuppa and sit back and  enjoy.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read.  Go back and  start from the beginning of the series so you can enjoy all the details.	1999-08-28

I really enjoyed finding out more about Edgar's past.  I wondered how he could leave his home, seemingly cut the ties with his relatives and move so far away.<br />This is an excellent  time period and now that Ellis Peters can no longer reveal Cadfael and his  times to us, Catherine and Edgar can pick up the slack.<br />Go back and find  them all and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.	1999-07-19

Yes, Ms McCrumb goes back and forth from the past to the present, but all it takes to follow from one time period to another is a capable reader.  This one wasn't as  spell binding as some of the others of this type, but it does hold the  reader's attention.  Get the others and read, read read.	1999-07-19

This is the in the middle of the collection and it is better to read them from the beginning so go out and find the others.

A whole year has to pass before the new Sanford is out.  I get it and read it overnight because my friends are all waiting.<br />This one is okay, and parts of it are excellent,  but there is something missing.  Perhaps as others have written it's the  fact that Lucas ought to have an excellent sex life and be able to get and  keep a woman, but that doesn't seem to be happening.  Perhaps it is because  I couldn't wait for the movie treatment to be released and it was  definitely a disappointment.  Eric LaSalle is no Lucas Davenport, although  he is a fine actor.<br />I will wait for the year it takes for the next Prey  to be released and hope that whatever it is that is missing from this one  is back in the next entry.	1999-07-19

The books, the swamps, the troubles that Bubba and company causes, the solutions to the problems.  They are all terrific.  I must admit to a bit of dismay at the end of the last book and Bobby's  playing with the butterflies, but I was glad to find an explanation for his  behavior in this one.<br />Read this and all the other bloodhound stories.	1999-07-19

Everyone I know who likes to read loves this series.  Stephanie Plum is a hoot and a half.  Ranger and Morelli, what a dilemma - don't we just wish we had those kinds of problems.<br />Keep  them coming.<br />Is number six really going to take a year - oh well, it's  only 52 weeks, 365 days, I'm sure we will survive.<br />Keep up the excellent  work.	1999-07-19
US	52833260	RM66X63EQGH63	0553106333	14890872	Ashes to Ashes	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not bad	This isn't bad as a serial killer book goes.  I found it hard going, but I kept on until the end and did enjoy the fact that I didn't figure out the killer before the ending.  I did wonder what happened to Thor.  I hope he  is alright.  My friend recommended this book to me knowing that I read a  lot.  I don't know if I will read any more of them or not.  I'll keep them  in mind if I run out of other things to read.	1999-07-19
US	52833260	R2MIOABBVANY3R	1575664305	36141406	The Trench	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent Read	A nice gruesome killer of the deep &quot;whale&quot; of a tale, or so to speak.  If you like this kind of book, you'll love this one.  It sounds like there's a movie in the works, so I guess that is a good thing.  I  would like to think that books can stand on their own and don't have to be  turned into someone else's work by splashed on the big screen.	1999-07-19

I  don't know now why Hard Bargain was hard to finish.  I put it away until  Hard Evidence came out and then finished the one before I read the other.  Kat Marsala is an excelelnt character.  I must confess I started reading  these in the library and then went to used bookstores to add them to my  collection, but once I got started I've been faithful.<br />I recommend this  and all of Barbara D'Amatos works to all those who love a good mystery and  have the skill to suspend their disbelief.  Who reads to solve the problems  of the world?  Read for pleasure and enjoyment.  There is time enough to  work on the problems of the world in daily life without working during your  leisure hours.	1999-07-19

Usually I plunge right in and read a new Muller the day I get it.  I tried, but this one is a disappoinment. I did get it done quickly, but it was more of a challenge than usual.  I have  many friends who wait for my books and I owe it to them to get them done in  a timely fashion.  Perhpas I am prejudiced.  I find that many of the  authors whom I enjoy are a disappoint when they go outside their general  geographic area.  This has happened time and time again.  Please return to  California and leave Hawaii to other authors.<br />Again, read this because it  continues the story line and is enjoyable, but not up to the usual  standards.	1999-07-19

I have read the other two books in the series and thoroughly enjoyed them, so in a way Hannibal is a bit of a disappointment.  I kept picturing Jodie Foster  continuing in her role from Silence of the Lambs and it just doesn't fit.  Read the book, but don't look for a satisfying ending.	1999-07-19

I think that as in most cases, it is better to go back and find the first books and then read  them in order.  It makes more sense to me to follow the character  development so you can enjoy how far the characters have come and how they  came to be the people they are now.  Go back and read All Shall Be Well,  Leave the Grave Green, Mourn Not Your Dead, Dreaming of the Bones, and then  Kissed a Sad Goodbye. Duncan and Gemma deserve your reading their stories.	1999-07-19

I didn't think I could wait for the next Mallory, especially with the wait of an extra year with the side trip to the Judas  Child (an excellent read) so I didn't mind the wait, but now it'll be  another year and I hope to not be disappointed again.<br />There was too much  magic and legerdemain and not enough Mallory and suspense.  I enjoy Charles  and the other characters, and I don't mind a little reference to magic and  Max Candle, but a little is plenty and the whole book should not be spent  in that area.  I agree with one of my booksellers that many of the  characters were way to easy to confuse and reduced my enjoyment of the  book.  Please return to the days of old and the better plot lines.	1999-07-19

I recommend  this to all who enjoy David Weber's Honor Harrington series and to those  who enjoy Jody Lynn Nye and Holly Lisle.	1999-07-19

In fact look for the whole series.  These are very good light reading.  The characters are good and the stories keep you interested.  I no longer fish, but I  enjoy reading about these characters who do love fishing, cooking, nude  sunbathing, and other island type lifestyles.  I don't think a lifestyle of  this type would be for everyone, and I know it's not for me, I enjoy air  conditioning, television, and the middle of the country, although a visit  to Martha's Vineyard isn't beyond hope.<br />Find all of the out of print ones  if you can, visit the library and find those you can and then plunge in and  enjoy.	1999-07-19

What a menagerie.  I enjoy these books, but they are not for everyone.  There are many people who take exception to animals being  involved in the writing of mystery stories for humans.  I do wish  &quot;Mom&quot; would get with the program and figure out that her animals  are communicating with each other and trying to tell her something.  She  spends enough time with them that she ought to figure out their body  language and that they are trying to tell her something.<br />Again, read  them, read them all.	1999-07-19

Genealogy and murder - hmm, who would have thought it, but wait, I know people who seem to care about their ancestors like some of the characters in this book.  I can seem some of them at least  thinking of murder if their lineage is ridiculed.  Again, these sixty  something sisters and their kin are a hoot and a half.  Read and enjoy.	1999-07-19

She journeys from America of the latish 1800's to England  where she enters a different world entirely.  I have more of this series  sitting on the shelf waiting for me to have time for them.

I got it from the libray, which is about the only way you'll be able to get a copy because it is almost as scarce as hen's teeth.  You can enjoy the series  without reading the first three which are regretably out of print, but  hopefully the publishers will get a clue and reprint the first three.  Go  to your local library and see if you can find these and then enjoy.<br />Jeff  Jackson and the characters of Martha's Vineyard are always up to some new  tricks.  The good thing - there are new books coming out all the time.  Keep up the good work.	1999-04-30

I do think that Aunt Dimity and the Duke should be first in the series, because I was looking for Lori Shepherd when I got to the 2nd in the series, but then she and  Bill were back in 3 and 4 and all was right with the world. So I recommend  reading them 2, 1, 3 and then 4 and hopefully twenty or thirty more before  the series is done.<br />Most of my friends won't enjoy the supernatural  element supplied by Dear Aunt Dimity, Reginald, and all of the wonderful  characters, but they don't know what they are missing.<br />I recommend these  for a rainy day curled up on the couch with a cup of tea, an afghan and a  cat or two purring away.<br />Get the whole series and enjoy!	1999-04-30

Liberty Falling is an excellent new book in the series.  I missed the wide open spaces, the scenery and Piedmont, but I also enjoy the feel of New York.

I love Holly Winter, Rowdy, Kimi, Tracker, Steve, etc., but where were they in this book?  There was way too much time spent on other areas.  Eugenics yes, but not the  whole book.

Read them, read them, read them.  Police procedurals are a genre of their own.  You either love them or you hate them.  I fall on the side of those who love them.  Cynthia Harrod-Eagle's are of course police procedurals set  in England, so if you don't enjoy that setting, then don't go here.  If you  feel a closeness with stories set in England, then you'll enjoy these.  I  was a little disappointed with Slider being a dim bulb when it comes to  women, but I guess that goes with the territory.  His crew finds him very  insightful and a great interviewer who sees many things that others miss,  but he can't see what goes on under his own nose.  I am waiting for him to  tumble to the fact that Atherton loves JoAnna and I wonder what this will  do the relationship amongst the three.  I eagerly await the next in this  series.<br />Again - read it, read it, read it	1999-03-27

If you enjoy reading long, involved stories that literally cover thousands of pages and many hours of reading, then get ready for a pleasurable read.  The works of Simon Green are excellent.  The  reader is caught up and hurled into the future with spell binding, page  turning intensity.  Get the first one in the series and then read, read,  read.	1999-01-30

I actually do know why I wait, it's because it will be another year before  the next one comes out and I hate the wait.  Fortunately for me, I read  this one because I have already purchased the next in the series, Ultimate  Dragon and so I don't have to wait a year to see what happens  next.<br />Please keep up the good work - and for those of you are looking for  an excellent, page turning read - read the works of Christopher Rowley.	1999-01-30

Every time I put off reading a Xanth novel (too many books, too  little time) I ask myself why.  They read quickly and are always good for a  laugh.  That doesn't explain the fact that I have two more sitting on the  shelf waiting to be read while I go on to other titles, but that's life.<br />Read all the Xanth books - they are great!<br />Go back to the beginning so  you can enjoy all the characters and the references to stories form the  past.	1999-01-02

Lieutenant Bak and his cohorts have many mysteries with which to contend.  The characters which people these books are very enjoyable.  Enough history for those who enjoy it, mixed with human  interaction.<br />I am interested in more about Lieutenant Bak's background  as a charioteer and what he did to be sentenced to the Belly of Stones.<br />I recommend this to all who enjoy historical fiction set in Ancient  Egypt.	1998-12-28

I enjoy this series as well as the Bed and Breakfast series that Ms Daheim writes.  I have read all the books in the series and had no trouble enjoying this addition, but  I feel that it would not be a good way to introduce new readers to this  excellent series.  Start with Alpine Advocate and then continue down the  line.  Following that course will allow the reader to enjoy all that has  lead up to Emma and Vida's relationship and to Emma's interaction with all  the characters in the series.	1998-12-28

I can't put the thing down once I start so work keeps getting in the way.  I disagree with the other reviewers in that Ms  Roberson spent too much time reviewing.  I think a little review frequently  helps keep a book going.  Now, if you're like some people and wait and read  the entire series at one time, or only read a few things and so can  remember everything about a character, more power to you.  However, I read  several books a month and like to have a reminder when I return to a series  that I've missed for a while.<br />I recommend this as well as all the  &quot;Dancer&quot; books.  I' looking forward to the next one.  Maybe I'll  actually get to read it as soon as I buy it.	1998-12-28

Aliens in Montana hunting for dinosaur bones because they are their long lost ancestors?  Okay, why not?  Birds are  descended from dinosaurs, so why not aliens, too?  It works for me.<br />This  book is enjoyable and an easy read.  I recommend it to those who enjoy a  little comedy with their science fiction and archeology.	1998-12-28

I find that I enjoy Emma Lord when she stays near Alpine.  Occasional trips to Seattle or to nearby towns are okay, but stay away from wandering too far afield.  Emma is in danger of  losing her staff.  The new college is adding a broader much needed scope to  Aline by bringing new blood into a little town.  Unfortunately, old blood  seems to be spilt when new blood comes to town.  I recommend this book to  all who enjoy a good mystery.<br />Please start with Alpine Advocate and  read your way to this one so you can enjoy the changes in Alpine and its  varied characters.	1998-12-28

I recommend this series to everyone, but I also urge you to start with the first in the series, The Body in the Belfry rather than  starting with a later entry.  I believe readers should enjoy the growth of  the characters and the depth of detail one finds when starting a series at  the beginning.<br />The only problem with this series - I have a whole year to  wait for the next one.	1998-11-29

The Right Hand of Amon reads quickly and easily.  I started it this morning and finished early this afternoon.  I found  another book by the same author that is to be released shortly, but parts  of the Right Hand read like there have been books previously published.  If  this is so I'd be interested in learning of their existence.  If this is  indeed the first in a series as other reviewers have stated, I look forward  to many more.<br />I recommend this to any who enjoy historical whodunnits.	1998-11-29

This is an excellent entry in the Callahan Garrity mystery series.<br />I was privileged to hear Ms Trocheck speak about her mystery series last week at a book  signing in the Raven Mystery bookstore in Lawrence, Kansas.  I enjoyed  hearing her talk about her characters.<br />Having visited the Atlanta,  Georgia area several times, I can picture in my mind's eye the areas Ms  Trocheck describes as the House Mouse crew goes about their daily  grind.<br />I recommend this series to everyone, but I also recommend starting  with the first of the series so as to enjoy character development and plot  details that are revealed in later books in the series.  I am looking  forward to the next in the series.	1998-11-29
US	52833260	R3UQ3YW9QBZ60W	0312193548	470650232	A Vow Of Compassion	Books	5	9	9	N	Y	Excellent	Sister Joan really doesn't mean to become involved with all those murders that keep happening around her.  She can't help having a suspicious mind, an observant eye, and a vocation that leads her to help all those who are  suffering.<br />This is another excellent entry into the Sister Joan series of  mysteries set in England.  The characters are well developed and enjoyable.  I recommend this series to everyone.  Again I also recommend that you  start with the first in the series so you can enjoy the growth of the  characters and the details that make this series very enjoyable.	1998-11-29

I like the way Ms Albert strews tidbits of herb  lore through this series.

The imaginary world of Pecan Springs and its cast of characters just keeps getting better.  China's most recent adventures leave the reader wanting  more.  I enjoy reading the quotes about various herb lore.  I am looking  forward to the next book.	1998-11-01

Jane and Shelley and their complicated  lives - who would imagine such goings on surrounding seemingly normal down  to earth people.  I'd like to move into this suburb and sit back and enjoy  the comings and goings.  Please keep up the good work.  This is a quick and  easy read that simply zips along.

Good characters, intricate plot, fast  reading - I'm ready for more.  Of course, I read this as soon as I bought  it and now I have to wait what will seem forever for the next in the  series.  I recommend this to all who enjoy a good fantasy.	1998-10-24
US	52833260	R1EHI8A1CESOVG	038531700X	117143822	The Loop	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A good read	I read the twenty-three other reviews of this title before I decided to  write and I think many of them are too harsh.  I too saw the Horse  Whisperer and then read it and liked the book better than the movie so I  eagerly awaited The Loop.  It is a page turner and kept me interested.  I  enjoyed most of the stories of the wolves' family life and found it fits  with most of what I've learned about wolf family life.  I also found it  fits with small town life in rural America.  I did enjoy it and recommend  it to others - perhaps a library copy or the paperback when it comes out.  I will take a chance on the next Nicholas Evans when it comes out.	1998-10-24

Catherine Sayler is an  excellent character who is an interesting member of the California female  private investigators who fill my bookshelves and entertain my friends and  me.  I recommend this to all who enjoy Kinsey Milhone and the other private  &quot;eyes&quot; of California.  Enjoy.	1998-10-24

Bodies seem to come their way in the  most unusual locations.  I enjoyed this book and read it as soon as I got  it, but it didn't read as quickly as most of Ms Daheim's works do.  I am  looking forward to the next Bed and Breakfast.  I frequently reocmmend  these titles to my friends.	1998-10-24
US	52833260	R2Y6RFSI7ZTWDR	0671878832	312696097	Black As Blood	Books	2	0	0	N	N	Interesting	Uncle Albert won't stay in his coffin.  What a way to start a book.  There are flashes of a really good tale, but as a fan of this kind of story and this publishing company I was expecting better.<br />The characters are good and have potential, but it just lacks a little something.<br />I'd read another one by the author if it goes into more detail.  It's Missouri and vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and the walking dead are supposedly commonplace.  I'd like an explanation of that since I don't think that's so commonplace in Missouri.<br />It's billed as &quot;tongue in cheek horror&quot; and I guess I was expecting more suspense and enjoyment.<br />Also, I've come to enjoy a brief biography of the author.  That would have been nice to see here.	1998-08-03

This is another good mystery from the paws of a very intelligent cat.  My only real complaint is that Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker don't give the humans enough credit.  Lassie could always get people to follow her when she needed help and I think that Tee Tucker, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter should try a little harder to get Harry to listen to them and follow them when needed.<br />I recommend this to all who like to talk to the animals.	1998-08-02

Last year I crossed the country and stopped in all the bookstores I could find to find the second in the series before it came out in paper, but  this one was a little harder to get into.  I guess I don't pay much attention to time lines, but what's the deal with it being 1995?  Yes, that's 30 years later than 1965, but so what?  As far as the reader is concerned the murders could have taken place in 1968 and then 1998 would be 30 years later.  That bothered me a little.<br />Don't get me wrong, I do recommend this and all of Lanier's books because I've loved everyone.  I too am waiting for Bubba to get what's coming to him and even with the good ole' boy network which protects him, I hope his end comes soon.<br />I was also a little concerned with the very end of the book and Bobby Joe.  I don't want to reveal too much because that spoils it for others, but a little better explanation is in order.  Was there something about the ditch he crossed!  that will explain what happens with him?<br />I know there will be about another year to wait for the next one, but please keep them coming.	1998-07-25

I have everything Mr. Griffin has written that I've been able to get my hands on since a friend turned me on to these fine stories several years ago.  As with most of the books I enjoy, the main problem with them is that I have to wait so long for the next in whatever series the author has turned to this time.  Please keep up the good work.	1998-07-21
US	52833260	R343F61R9CGU3A	0515117900	662972356	Killer Instinct	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Excellent	Okay, I confess I keep trying not to find authors new to me, but I was searching the &quot;horror&quot; and the Instinct series caught my eye.  I have learned to my chagrin that I need to sit down and read a few pages before running off to buy a bunch of books.  (I didn't always have such sense.)  I was lucky to find the whole series sitting there and sat down to see what kind of book it was that started such a string of books.<br />I was hooked from the first page.  Robert Walker did make me thing of Cornwell and Scarpetta, and in a way of Sanford and Davenport.  I read the first fifty pages and then took the books to the checkout counter so I could get home and dive into the rest.<br />I recommend these books to all who enjoy the likes of Cornwell and Sanford and who as an earlier reviewer put it, spend some of their time with their doors locked and all the lights on in their house hoping that evil stays outside and far away.	1998-07-21

Stalkers and those who are intolerant of other's lifestyles are gaining more and more power and there is little anyone can do about it.  I have read all the books in this excellent series and hate to wait the year it takes for the next one to come out in hardback.  I sat down and read it pretty much in one sitting.  The characters are well developed.<br />I recommend that a reader new to the series start back a few titles, or maybe from the very beginning.  The stories are well worth the time and energy it will take to read all 19.<br />I hope the year passes quickly and we see the developments in all the varied relationships revealed in these books.<br />Good work.	1998-07-15

I finished reading Point of Origin two days ago, but didn't get a chance to get to the computer until today.  I read the other reviews before I put fingers to keyboard.  I get tired of reading about people who expect more from authors than a good, page turner of a story.  If you want to cure the evils of the world, don't look to fiction for the answers.<br />Patricia did a good job, and I for one am interested in what happens to the villains as time passes.  It's a sad statement that Carrie was able to manipulate the system and do the things she does in the story.<br />And as to the comment about the end of the main story from one reader, who knows what really happened?  I seem to remember that appearances can be deceiving...Please keep up  the good work.  I'm recommending this to my pals.	1998-07-15

Benjamin Janvier returns in a sequel to A Free Man of Color.  The images that are invoked are excellent.  The streets of New Orleans, the culture, the miscarriage of justice reflect the way it was.  My friends who teach French and enjoy mysteries loved the frist one after I pointed it out to them.  I am recommending this one as well. Please keep up the good work.	1998-07-15

It was recently recommended to me by a friend and I found a copy at the bookstore.  I sat down for a minute to read the first few pages thinking that if it was any good I would have read it when it first came out.  Well, an hour later and sixty pages into the book I didn't want to put it away to go pay for it.  I did go ahead and get this combination volume rather than trying to find all three volumes and I recommend that to everyone.<br />Sometimes it pays to wait for a book because then you can read it and its sequels all at once, and I did.  It took a while and I had to put up with a few inconveniences like sleep, food, friends, etc but it was well worth it.  This definitely ranks as one of the best that I've ever read and I have read a few.  I also have the prequel, the Legacy of Gird and can't wait to get to that as well.<br />Again - read this book!	1998-07-10

Rattlesnake Crossing is an excellent addition to the previous Joanna Brady mysteries.  Set in a large county in Arizona shots rings out in the night and JoAnna is off again trying to save the citizens of Cochise County from murder.  Fans of the Joanna Brady should also check out JA Jance's other series JP Beaumont of Seattle.  I recommend both series to mystery fans.	1998-07-10

I do wonder what happened between Larceny and Old Lace and this one to Tony who was supposed to own her aunt's old shop and was her mother's boy friend.  In this second in the series we have Calamity Jane owning the store and no mention of Tony - what happened to him?  We also seem to have lost some of the other antique store owners.  The book still does a fine job, but a little more continuity might be in order to keep readers coming back for more.  Please, tie up the loose ends so we know what happens to some of the characters that seem to have disappeared.	1998-07-02

She is surrounded by a cast of interesting characters, her mama who resembles June Cleaver, her Aunt Marilyn Monroe who claims to have been the inspiration for a more well known Marilyn Monore, her on again off again friend Greg Washburn who resembles Gary Grant in more ways than one, and an eclectic group of antique store owners in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I enjoyed this first in a series of four (so far) books by Ms Myers.  It was hard to put it down.  I recommend it to everyone.	1998-07-02

I've been waiting for the next installment in this series and was thrilled when it came out.  Jack Fleming, a vampire with a conscience, is quite a character.  Angela is quite a dame and the other characters that &quot;flesh&quot; out the story are all well done.  I read on the jacket that Ms Elrod is branching out into other genre but I hope she continues this series and that of Johnathan Barrett, Gentleman Vampire.	1998-06-30

I recommend this book to anyone who likes a quiet read by the fire (or during the present heatwave the airconditioner).  Granger conjures up good images of the characters and the English countryside.  I enjoy the little tidbits of life in the pubs, the cottages, the towns and the interplay amongst the characters.  My only regret is that since they start in England it takes a long time to get the next volume in the United States.	1998-06-30

Yes, I love Honor and I hate to wait for the next episode coming in October.  The suspense is killing me.  I did visit the Baen homepage and read a bit of the next one.

It's been quietly sitting and waiting on the shelf.  I am glad I finally got to it, and I see there's a sequel coming out fairly soon and I can hardly stand the suspense.  I've enjoyed Barbara Hambly's fantasy books and bought this one as soon as it was out.  Sometimes it's worth it for the book to sit and wait because then the sequel will be along sooner.<br />I have recommended this to two of my friends who teach French and are both interested in New Orleans and history.  I hope this is the first in a long line of the stories of Benjamin Janvier.	1998-06-26

It sounds like most of them haven't read enough of this type of book and don't hang out with teenagers enough.  It was a very satisfactory read and I did finish it in a little more than one sitting.  Again I don't understand what people expect from fantasy.  It shouldn't try to solve all the problems of the world, it should just be a good way to spend time.  I enjoy most of the Lackey/Dixon books and am looking forward to more of the Valdemar history.  I must admit I do love those grphons.	1998-06-26

What more can you ask for but a cozy chair and a gripping tale to keep you occupied.  I am getting tired of reading reviewers who expect something more from fantasy writers than a good read.  When you pick up a fantasy book I hope you aren't expecting to cure all the ills of the world cause that just isn't going to happen.  What you ought to expect is a story that will keep you reading and wanting more when you finish.  Mr. Weber does that time and again.  I'm ready for more of the hradani and Bahzel and his friends.<br />I love Honor and I just read some of the sample on the Baen Home Page.  October seems to be forever, but there are many authors who will help pass the time until Echoes of Honor is out for the public.  Mr. Weber, please keep up the good work.	1998-06-20

Jingo was worth the wait.  I especially enjoyed the dis-organizer.  I feel he will be much happier in the tummy of a shark who probably appreciates it more than did Vimes.  I liked the alternate reality and got a chill as the demon announced what was happening in the other reality when Vimes didn't react as he did.  The only problem I have with this serie it that it takes too long between books.  I waited to read them and now I'll have to wait again.  Keep up the good work.	1998-06-11

Lots of yummy recipes interspersed with a tasty mystery.<br />Lou Jane Temple does a good job with the Kansas City area and with her characters.

It was easy to picture in my mind's eye and while sad, it gets the book off to a good start.  I missed some of the characters I've enjoyed reading, but Kat has a lot to deal with in this and a spousal abuse case did help her come out of her own troubles.<br />It should make you stop and think about your own relationships and remember that there is no guarantee that tomorrow, or even five minutes from now will ever come.<br />I always look forward to a new Kat Colorado book and was eagerly searching the shelves for this new entry.  The only problem with getting a new Kat Colorado book is that I read it too quickly and then have another year to wait for the next one.<br />Please keep them coming	1998-06-06
US	52833260	R2HT9WN7V63PPN	0312186770	229878138	A Veiled Antiquity	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	More please	A Veiled Antiquity leaves you wanting to know more about Torie O'Shea and those who surround her in New Kassel, Missouri.<br />There are good clues dropped along the way and interesting hints in to the lives of the characters in this little town just a hop skip and a jump outside of St. Louis.<br />Again the only problem with finishing a brand new book is that one has to wait so long before the next one comes out.  Sometimes it's better to read authors whose series have been around for a while and you can immerse yourself in several before you have to suffer the pains and agonies of waiting for new releases.  Rett MacPherson makes me wish she had been published much earlier.	1998-06-06

As any developing mystery series I expect the characters to expand as the series does.  If you find out everything about a character at the beginning of the series what is there to discover later?  Barbeque is big business and Lou Jane Temple does as many other authors do, sets the characters and story line in a place she knows.<br />Again, I recommend this series to anyone who likes an enjoyable mystery and wants some yummy recipes to add to their menus.	1998-06-06
US	52833260	R2CEQX0QT10LHI	0399144021	190244664	Secret Prey	Books	5	0	0	N	N	More please.	Lucas Davenport is back and as good as ever.  I missed his lady friend, but remembering what happened in the last book.  I can understand why she needs a break from Lucas and his intensity.  I recommend this book to anyone who is not squeamish. If you are, John Sanford and Lucas Davenport are not for you.  I bought it and read it in one evening and now I have to wait a year for the next one.  So many books and so little time.	1998-06-01
US	52833260	R3KAFFD2BH5MJK	0312966024	865627315	Family Skeletons (Torie O'Shea Mysteries, No. 1)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	Great	So many &quot;new&quot; authors, so little time to read.  This was an excellent page turner.  Genealogy can reveal many interesting secrets.  &quot;Torie&quot; O'Shea and her family are a good new entry into the mystery field.  Enough suspense to keep you guessing and enough clues to help you figure out the crime.  This is the second author I've taken to recently from this group.  Laurell K Hamilton also writes an excellent story.  Keep up the good work.	1998-05-25
US	52833260	R2ZRK0JZG2LL3L	0805036504	595466515	N is for Noose	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Nicely done	I bought it Friday, and read it Sunday.  As usual Sue Grafton keeps me turning the pages waiting to see what comes next.  The plot was good, the characters interesting and the descriptions enjoyable.  I read other customer comments, and I'd wondered why Kinsey hasn't come to the big screen.  But I agree that so often movies ruin the characters.  I know that while I enjoyed V I Warshawski on the big screen, she didn't fit my imagined character at all.  If Kinsey ever makes it to film, I hope Ms. Grafton has total control so her vision can be portrayed.	1998-04-29

This one had to wait a while because I was hung up on Last Act.  Time to Depart went quickly, but this one seemed to drag again.  I guess I think Marcus and Helena need to stay in Rome more.  The traveling seems to drag the story down too much.  I don't remember feeling that way about the earlier books in the series, but Last Act was really bad.  I stopped half way through it and let it lay for six months.  This one didn't sit that long, but it did take the better part of a week to read and that seems like a little too long.<br />  I did like the interplay betwen Falco and Helena.  I missed Petronius and Falco's family.  The books just seem to flow better when set in Rome.  I hope the next one, which I am eagerly awaiting returns to the seven hills.	1998-04-19

Jean Claude is quite yummy, too bad he's dead.  Richard even yummier?  Let's see, they are a triumverate, Jean Claude is out of it during the day, Richard is around all the time.  They should be able to work something about among the three of them.  Perhaps next time.  It helps that Richard is at least speaking to Anita again.<br />Yes, one too many plot lines, maybe, but it was very easy to follow all of them.  Yes, the leopards need a leader, the Council needed to come into the twentieth century as we are entering the twenty-first, and everyone needs someone.  I did miss Edward in this episode, but his Uzi was a nice touch.<br />Keep up the good work.  I just got this book from Amazon on Saturday, and I finished it on Sunday.  Now, the long agonizing wait until the next one.	1998-04-12
US	52833260	R1PQ3RM6HSIYMJ	0892966262	972782594	Time to Depart (Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries)	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Back on track and back to Rome.	Ah, Time to Depart is much better than Last Act in Palmyra.  I waited to read Time to Depart until I finished Last Act, and that took quite a while.  Marcus and company are quite enjoyable.<br />  I agree with many others that it is time for Helena and Marcus to get married.  It seems that Caesar owes Marcus quite a bit for all his loyal work and something should be able to be worked out about his rank.<br />  A new apartment, a baby on the way, a major crime boss destroyed, a major fire averted, ah such is the life of an informer in Ancient Rome.<br />The next book in the series is sitting on the shelf and that's the one I'll be reading next.<br />  Keep up the good work!	1998-04-12
US	52833260	R3BMOYPTWVW66S	0446404748	47755516	Last Act in Palmyra (Marcus Didius Falco Mysteries)	Books	2	2	5	N	N	Not the best	I really enjoy the Falco novels, but this one was disappointing.  I purchased it soon after it was published, started it, but left it unfinished until recently.  I finished it and started Time to Depart which returns to Rome.  I feel that Last Act leaves much to be desired, but enjoy the other titles in the series.  Keep up the good work.	1998-04-07
