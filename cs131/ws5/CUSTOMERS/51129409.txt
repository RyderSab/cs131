This is a book that would be especially meaningful to anyone who loves someone who suffers from an addiction (or struggles with an addiction themselves) but it is a compelling story whether that's your situation or not. And while the book deals with one particular addiction, alcoholism, there were so many parallels to other kinds of addictions and to the human struggle with sin in general, that I think anyone would come away inspired. And the cover and interior book design are just gorgeous!	2004-06-02

Because of other books the author has written, I expected this book to be free of the sensuality found in so many romance novels, and suitable for younger readers. But I would definitely not want young people to form their ideas about wholesome dating from this. I'm very disappointed that a writer of Christian books would also write this kind of stories.	2002-09-28

Exchange peas and corn for wheat and milo, and Traci's descriptions of the farming community of Lake Emily are where I grew up, right down to the extension meetings. As I read, I felt as though I were reliving my childhood. Lovely!<br />~ Deborah Raney, author of Beneath a Southern Sky and A Vow to Cherish	2002-07-25

What an inspiration it was to read about the faith journeys and writing journeys of some of my favorite Christian authors. I thought I would just skim through and read about the authors I'm familiar with, but each story was so interesting and unique that I read the book cover to cover--and found some new authors I'd like to try out. This book was a great idea!  I'm always curious about the authors of the books I read. I can't believe someone didn't think of writing a book like this before.	2002-02-19

Don't read this book if you don't want to be convicted of God's awesome power, of the need to 'go ye into all the world', and of the relatively powerless life most American Christians lead. The testimony of Joanne Shetler was an inspiration to me. My God is much greater than I give him credit for being. I intended to merely skim this book as research for a novel I'm working on, but the story compelled me to read every word and then read it--prayerfully--again.<br />Deborah Raney, author of A Vow to Cherish and Beneath a Southern Sky	2001-12-13

Spring Rain is a wonderful story of family conflict, blossoming romance and the healing power that faith brings in times of heartache and struggle. Roper's characters are likeable, even charming, but not too perfect to be real. The romantic element--especially between the characters of Julia and David--is heartwarming.	2001-11-21

Schaeffer is a talented writer and I did enjoy his portrayal of Italy and Switzerland, but I thought his recurring scenes of teenage petting and masturbation were annoying and juvenile and grossly repetitive. The author seemed to take perverse pleasure in using &quot;naughty words&quot; and pushing the envelope. This might have been fine if he'd managed to make the pleasure seem like 14-year-old Calvin's, but instead it smacked of author intrusion. A redemptive, satisfying ending might have salvaged the book for me, but instead it ended abruptly without resolving two main plotlines! <br />Given what I know about Schaeffer's family, and having read (though I didn't necessrily agree with) many of his parents' books, Saving Grandma and its predecessor, Portofino, seemed to be mean-spirited and vindictive.  A disclaimer in the front of the book states &quot;...any resemblance to persons or events...is entirely coincidental.&quot; I find it difficult to see how he could have included this  with a straight face or a clear conscience!	2001-10-17

Great insight on the subject of contentment. The book covered areas I hadn't even thought of, such as the chapter on Divine Discontent--realizing that sometimes feelings of discontent are God-sent for a specific purpose. This would be an incredible book for a Bible study group and each chapter includes discussion questions.	2001-05-29

Angela Hunt has woven a unique and clever story that kept me turning pages and surprised me at several turns. The story stands on its own as a captivating contemporary tale of a disenchanted columnist who finds more than she bargained for when she is given a mysterious note that washed up in the debris from a tragic plane crash. But when you delve into the allegory woven throughout, the novel becomes an amazing gem! You won't be disappointed and you won't soon forget this story.	2001-05-16

Lisa Samson may as well quit writing right now because I don't know how she will ever top The Church Ladies. Samson's irresistible town of Mount Oak is Mitford with a glorious edge; and the characters who populate her novel are as familiar as the man or woman who occupies the pew beside you each Sunday morning. Perhaps, as I did, you'll even catch a glimpse of yourself within the pages. This captivating, precious story of grace could not be more beautifully told.<br />~ Deborah Raney, author of Beneath a Southern Sky	2001-04-02

I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for or emphathy with Samantha. It's difficult to feel sorry for a woman who drinks too much, goes home with a man, willingly gets into bed with him, then tries to call it &quot;date rape.&quot;<br />Though Berg sometimes hits a chord that resonates &quot;yes, this is the way women are,&quot; most of the time I find myself wondering where these women she writes about live. Because it surely isn't in any neighborhood I'm familiar with. The American women I know are much more selfless, moral, and loyal. I'd love to see Berg base a book on such characters. Her talent seems wasted on characters who have no integrity and go through life adrift, without a solid foundation.	2001-03-15

Compelling characters, and Bergren did a wonderful job of making her setting every bit as interesting and important as her characters. The intertwining of stories from two generations was masterful. Meaningful message, but subtle. I didn't want it to end.	2001-02-10

The medical terminology is well-used and realistic, but what captured me most were the personalities of the characters. The authors have a way of making the reader care about emergency room patients we'd only met a page or two ago. Very well-drawn and real characters -- heroes and heroines, but very human too...people I could relate to. Best of all, there are two more books in the series!	2001-01-29

Bell's story kept me turning pages and introduced me to characters I truly wanted to know better. The first person point of view made Jake Denney come alive, with all his flaws and loveable quirks. Several of his lines made me laugh out loud. But in spite of the entertainment quality of the novel, it had something important to say, too. The Truth dawned on Jake in a very convincing and intelligent way and he never lost his &quot;realness&quot;.	2001-01-18

Most of us in the group tend to be &quot;Marthas&quot; but we learned so many things about the joys and rewards of learning to have a &quot;Mary&quot; heart. We have referred to this book over and over again as we encourage one another--as Joanna Weaver encouraged us--to put aside the busy-ness of our lives and concentrate on what's really important. The side bars and anecdotes make this book easy to read. In fact, several of us had trouble stopping at the end of the chapter each week! Highly recommended!	2001-01-10

This is a wonderful book of short essays on topics that really matter to women--family, friendship, faith, forgiveness. The tone of the book is uplifting and encouraging.

My own faith was strengthened as I  walked with Elisabeth through the trials of her life.

This novel was difficult to get into and seemed a little &quot;preachy&quot; at first. Clarence had a major chip on his shoulder, which annoyed me at times, but I must admit that it made me think about the racism (subtle and otherwise)  that still exists in America. If you look at reading this book as an  educational experience, Alcorn's forays into history and politics, and his  occasional sermonizing won't be so distracting. I'm grateful for the things  it opened my eyes to, but I think the &quot;Reader's Digest Condensed  Version&quot; would be a better read.	1999-10-12

The author made me care about what happened to each one of her characters. My only reservation about the story was the fact that of six women who were major players in the book, only one of them had a positive, important romantic relationship in her life and even that came late in life and was rather short-lived. To me that seemed very unrealistic. However, the book was well-written and kept my interest to the end.	1999-09-27
