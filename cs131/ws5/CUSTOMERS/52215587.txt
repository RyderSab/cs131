It has as its companion, the author's book Charms, Spells, & Formulas. In general, it is good. The traditional botanica material on candle burning is very good. It also gives some very interesting correspondences between the odus (referring to the geomancy oracle) and the (Louisiana) Vodou Lwas. The main problem with the book is what is missing. There is a lot that screams for more development. The book has some obvious holes. It is not well written for that reason.	2005-03-28

It follows the same sound premise of previous books of his that the magical practices are reflected in the ancient legends. Because Blamires is being published by Llewellyn, his books have taken on a format different from his first book, \\"The Irish Celtic Magical Tradition.\\" I think Llewellyn gets a bit too much in the way of their authors. Hopefully, they will change their editorial staff. Be that as it may, I believe there are few people who have so clear a view of the Celtic magical tradition as Blamires. The exercises in this book are good for self-exploration. One of the most interesting things about the Celtic spiritual, or magical, path is how well it lends itself to inner-work. I suppose this is because of the richness of its archetypal content. Anyone interested in magic, Wicca, Druidry, Celtica, and depth psychology will find this book worth owning.	2005-03-11

It reads like a dream if you tune in to it, and reveals very deep meanings about the relation between life and death, the human relation to the forces of nature, and time. Even though there are no words, it is possible to understand. If you get into it the symbols become more and more recognizable, and they begin to speak. the calendrical symbols and the spirit deities are completely recognizable. The sequences are all about times, and there is a big element about sacrifice. It has to do with the consequences of change; there is no life without death. The book has a very powerful image of life and death fused back to back that pretty much is the epitome of all the book is about. It's all about life and death in relation to time.	2005-02-15

While it isn't a how-to self-initiation book on Vodou, (don't be disappointed) it contains some powerful shamanistic exercises rooted in the (Haitian) Vudou tradition. It is always interesting to see how the Vodou adapt to the needs of the world. By itself, this book can not give readers a full view of the tradition, but I don't think that is its purpose. Vodou as an ancient tradition has a lot of deep roots. It varies not only from country to country, especially from Africa to America, but from family to family. The book gives readers insight into how the Lwa can be worked with effectively in shamanistic healing. In other words, it shows how this very ancient and beautiful African tradition ties in with the general field of shamanism and, by extention, modern psychotherapy. I think this is its main point, and for this reason, the book is very valuable. The exercises that are found in it are as good and effective as you let them be. This is not the first book that links shamanism with psychotherapy. Another great example of this is Armold Mindell's \\"The Shaman's Body.\\"	2005-01-15

It is an epoch that hints in places of biblical legends but is not derived from the bible by any means at all. In addition to the legends there is some illuminating material about the most sacred places in Africa and about the ancient Ba'ntu language and grand civilization that once covered most of Africa. There is also something about the magical language that is used in Cameroon to communicate with the ancestral spirits which the author believes to have come down from paleolithic times. The last section reveals some of the secret core traditions of African spirituality. Anyone interested in African tradition owes it to themself to read this book. It is deeply moving.	2005-01-15

The herbs are all native American, the way of using them are typically African and Indian, especially of the Indians of the South, there being similarities between these two cultures. Hoodoo is not the same as Vodou (Voodoo) even though they share some of the same elements.

The book is a typical Lillian Too visual production, not entirely to my taste, but it has interesting information some of which is original. There are other books on the Plum Blossom method and fortune teller's I Ching that compare favorably with this one, especially The Tao of I Ching by Jou Tsung Hwa, and the now out of print books by W.K.Chu and W.A.Sherrill, Anthology of I Ching and The Astrology of I Ching. There is another book that contains an effective I Ching predictive method based on Chinese astrology, Feng Shui Strategies for Business Success. Be all that as it may, this book is well worth purchasing by anyone interested in the many possibilities of working with the I Ching.

The author needs to respect his material enough to take command and improve the production quality. When compared to the graphics in the book Qigong Empowerment by Master Shou-Yu Liang & Wen-Ching Wu, the trashy graphics here are an insult to serious students of qigong. The book therefore needs serious editing in its graphics. In a nutshell, the production quality is unworthy of the material. The book needs to be redesigned.	2004-12-30

Montenegro knows his stuff; he is a deep scholar of the African traditions in the New World. He has done tremendous good for all those initiated in the Congo tradition. For those who understand the heart of the matter, there are only superficial differences between Brazilian, Cuban and Haitian forms of the Congo traditions, and these differ in degrees from the Congo traditions in Africa. African traditions are all mutable and inclusive while keeping a strong root that goes down hundreds of thousands of years to the beginning of humans. People who want to complain about these things don't know the tradition. The books of Montenegro are really good. We are fortunate to have them. They are for the positive evolution of everyone. Not everyone needs to get into this. Palo and Kimbanda are very special, and Montenegro is a special teacher.	2004-12-23

He has a very good intent. Congo tradition in Brazil is different in some details from the tradition in Cuba. Most people in the US who are familiar with Palo only know about one or another of the the Cuban forms. Knowledge of African systems is difficult to get. African houses are notoriously secret. Kimbanda is a Brazilian kind of Palo. Palo is Congo. In Congo here are secret societies whose practices are not the same as the New World forms although they are similar. There is a lot of room in African traditions for variance while the root is always the same. Montenegro is true to the root. He does a lot of good for people with his art. People who don't know enough unfortunately choose to trash what Montenegro has generously shared. People who understand this know how the spirits are pleased. Sad to say, I don't blame Montenegro for withdrawing his books in Palo at this time. May his work continue to flourish. May those who childishly attack him grow up and learn.	2004-12-22

Obviously there are those who like him. In some places in his book he is a very likeable character. If this book were edited properly, and all the fluff, helter-skelter babble and infomercial stuff were cut out, it might about 30 pages long, not 383. It is amazing how scattered and superficial it is and how one can write so much and say so little. One wades through miles of new age sentimental slop in this book. It uses the story of Harriet Tubman as its spring board, but one can't help but reflect on how it trivializes and exploits the extraordinary mission of Harriet Tubman for its commercial purposes. Notwithstanding, the author clearly has a good heart. One hopes one day he will find the way to go into depth and write something good, not this mediocre new age fiddle-faddle that wastes ones time to read. The author, it must be said, spins a few good yarns (he seems to be a pretty good story teller) and his overall book structure is good. nonetheless, he repeats certain literary devices with which he ties the different sections of the book together ad nauseum, and then endlessly throws in bits of this and that, quoting this one and that one, which gives one the impression of a barrage of distracting noise. Often one wonders sometimes just what he's trying to say in all that. There is a great deal in thie book that is poorly thought out, not to mention his opinions and personal differences with other writers whom he attacks without reason. It really mars the book. Then he skitters over the surface of his subject, talking around its issues, and paints a warped picture. He forces the subject of psychic dreams, and he doesn't develop it. If the dreamer want's better information in this direction, they would do better to read Cornelius Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, published by Llewellyn. The author of this book writes like a scatter brain. Hopefully the so called new age readership willbegin demanding books that either are not so superficial.	2003-06-11

His understanding of what he calls the Dreaming Body and Process Work addresses, from a unified standpoint, all areas of human experience: dreams, physical symptoms, illnesses, relationship issues, perceptions of reality, the senses, life, death, existence, and you name it. It is difficult to describe Mindell's healing approach in conventional terms because his dreambody work is not therapeutic, as in corrective, but allows for the individuation process to happen freely and naturally. Mindell points to a development of awareness of perception through all channels of experience. Among many other interesting things, he says, \\"The central message of this book is that the spirit of your body, the dreambody, is a multi-channeled signaller which seeks your attention through your dreams, body symptoms and relationship problems. Moreover, the dreambody is influenced by the world around you and, paradoxically, your dreambody is also the body of the world. Healing now becomes a very comprehensive task, and the term itself can be substituted for integrating dreams, and integrating the projections and problems of the world around you.\\" Anyone who has an interest in psychology, dreams, and body work can only benefit by delving into this, and the other books of Mindell.	2003-04-25

However, it is rather curious to reflect that in this system there is an image of the Creator as an Eagle that seems intent upon devouring what it produces. In purely psychological terms, that's an image of the Evil Mother. Besides being a useful go-get-'um, i.e., reason for doing for all the occult gymnastics, the Eagle, in other words, the Mother Complex, is indeed a major challenge in every man's psychological development. However, is the Mother Complex the same as the Creator, or, God? Which brings us to the other side of this Toltec coin: the so-called Human Form, which, don Juan assures us is our idea of God. This may, indeed, be a common idea of God, but it is altogether misleading to call this God, because what is commonly thought of as being God is not God, God having no image or form or name or whatever you want to ascribe to God unless, of course, you are talking about a god. It might be instructive for the credulous readers and fans of this very fascinating writer, Casteneda, to study such sources of the ancient wisdom tradition of the West as the writings of Plotinus or, God forbid, the Kabbalah. Perhaps, in the light of such readings, the wisdom and occult exercises of this don Juan character will appear in a richer and more balanced light. As for occult exercises, it would behoove the serious student of magic to look into the Golden Dawn system or something comparable. By the way, don Juan's virtuoso feat of disappearing into the void is not the exclusive property of the Toltecs or Aztecs. This technique is known in other cultures, even ones that know nothing about devouring Eagles and such. Attachment to such images is a bigger obstacle on the way than the devouring Eagle itself. All that said, there is much that is valuable in Casteneda. Let his readers sort that out for themselves.	2002-05-26

I am writing as an initiate in a traditional British Druid society. It must be understood that what is known of the old Druid practices is somewhat sparse; Druidry was subjected to corrosive forces for more than 2000 years. While there are some significant differences between them, there are distinct parallels between the Druid traditions and what is now called Wicca. It must be understood that Druidry evolved over many millenia, and that it changed its focus more than once. It was never something fixed, uniform and stable. Too many people want to think of it as being something that was immutable. Well, it ain't so; to think like that is sentimental and smacks of a nostalgia for something that never was. Among other things, there was a major change in the general Druid tradition at about the 6th century BC. It also must be understood that there were many variants of Druidry, as there were many tribes and many royal lineages. Druidry at one time was the spiritual culture of Gaul, Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Scotland. In these lands, different languages were spoke and different gods and goddesses were recognised. To criticise Blamires' book on the basis that it isn't real Druidry therefore is sheer nonsense. Blamires' books are excellent. His exercises give the sincere readers wonderful opportunities to develope their inner world. Perhaps he will have learned something from the rather arrogant and ignorant criticisms of some of his readers and write a book containing exercises for the elimination of self-importance. For all those who love the Irish culture and Druidry, Blamires' books are not to be overlooked.	2002-05-18

In it, the author takes the old Irish classic The First Battle of Moytura as the model for his exposition of magical workings. My reservations about it are these: Blamires' style of magic is really patterned on the Hermetic model, and his path workings I find completely unnecessary. One doesn't need path workings to visit the four cities. One needs rather to learn astral projection to find out what they are like. As for the Hermetic model, it is perfectly good, if not old Irish. Considering the corrosion to which the Druid traditions were subjected over the centuries however, one really cannot expect much better than this. One thing that is certain is that Blamires' methods work and do give a beautiful basis for exploring and working with the still potent Irish deities. Blamires' other book Glamoury, based on some of the Duanaire Finn, is similar to this. It brings the reader into another dimention of the magical possibilities of working with the Irish deities. They are quite remarkable.	2002-05-18

Where in the world did the author come up with civilization, if that's what you call it, starting 3600 years ago? Multiply that by 20 maybe. And what's this about ETs? It is true, some people from Sirius were remembered to have come to Earth a long time ago. The Dogon people in Africa know about this; they even have precise astronomical information about the star system Sirius which was only confirmed in the late 20th century by Western scientists. The ancient Egyptians, it seems, also had this information. The Sumerian myth-legend of the fish-man, Oannes, may also relate to this. Oannes was said to have come from a watery planet of the star system Sirius, and to have lived for a while under the sea on the earth, probably the Red Sea, from whence he came up to give the ancients some information that influenced their culture. It is also believed that the fish incarnation of Vishnu relates to Oannes. But this nonsense about a 12th planet and that the humans were created by ETs is a lot of malarchy. Put a totally blind man in front of an elephant and tell him to describe to you what the elephant looks like after he feels one of its ears. This is about where the author is about this all too vague and useless subject. The nearest star system to ours is Alpha Centuri. Alpha Centuri is a binary star. It lies at a distance from our sun 275,000 times that of the earth from the Sun. Figure, 93,000,000 miles times 275,000. There is no known planet in that star system. So far, we know of nine planets in our solar system, not ten, not eleven. It is most unlikely that there is a trans-Plutonian planet. By a stretch of the imagination, one might call the asteroid Chiron a planet, but even so, that would only make ten planets. So what's this about a twelfth planet? Hmm?	2002-05-01

Ophiel was a very straight forward writer on these subjects. He really knew what he was writing about. His instructions are clear, simple, right to the point, free of all the fluff so often found in books nowadays days, and very effective. His writing style is also very amusing - very American colloquial, casual and unpretentious. It is hoped that Weiser will eventually reprint all of Ophiel's books.

The most extroadinary thing he did was develope the Armanen Futhork. He also was deeply steeped in the local traditions of Lower Austria, and had much insight into the secret Norse-Germanic symbolism in the archetecture of the Middle Ages. Linking him with the Nazis is rather like putting the cart before the horse. His political intent was to champion pan-Germanic unity for which reason he won the enthusiastic support of many German and Austrian aristocrats and industrialists. The fact of the matter is that the ethos of the Norse-Germanic faith is 100% opposite that of National Socialism. The racist content of List's writings, as well as those of the rune writers of the generation that followed him, is certainly open to criticism. It certainly did color his understanding of the meanings of several of the Runes which, in the light of scholarship in Norse-Germanic etymology and mythology, makes his material less valuable than it first seemed. It is unfortunate that many of his followers still choose to be racists and bigots, none of which has any positive value in the field of magic or in Norse-Germanic cultural development. It must be pointed out that the 19th-20th century form of racism has nothing at all to do with the ancient Norse-Germanic people. It is entirely the evil fruit of church propaganda as well as the stupid blather of Mme. Blavatsky who had a big influence on what came to be known as the Ariosophist movement in Germany. The Ariosophists were just the apes of the Theosophists with a German bias. One needs to look at this ugly chapter of German history with the eyes of the historian. Germany, in the late 19th and earlier 20th centuries was struggling to free itself from foreign oppression. This book is of historical importance. It was had a big influence on later German rune book writers, the best of whom is Karl Spiesberger. Spiesberger wrote in the 1950s in Berlin. His work is excellent and entirely free of the foul stench of bigotry. If you read German, look for his books: Runenmagie and Runenpraxis der Eingeweiten - Runenexerzitien. In The Secret of the Runes, called Das Geheimnis der Runen, in the original, the translations of the Spells of Odin from the Havamal are interesting and poetic, if slightly incorrect. The translation from the German of Guido List to the English of Stephen Flowers is good, but loses some of the beauty of List's German translation. Since the time of List, and certainly since after the two wars, there has come about much good scholarly research into the Norse-Germanic faith in Germany. For the German reader, I very much recommend reading professor Rudolf Simek's Lexicon der germanischen Mythologie. The restoration of a viable Norse-Germanic magical praxis depends on scholarly research, deep contemplation into the meanings of the Runes and intelligent experimentation. Bombastic and heavy-handed spouting about the master race and all that sort of nonsense has nothing at all to do with this tradition. The sooner the students of the Norse-Germanic tradition stringently divorce themselves from this senseless evil and work toward elevating their intellect to the tremendous heights of the true Odinic genious, the sooner this tradition will revive in a positively meaningful way.	2002-04-23

The deck, once one gets past its crudities, i.e., it is drawn in a most amateurish fashion, is also highly interesting and useful, especially in that it contains Enochian and Cabalistic correspondences. The one thing that always has puzzled me in all the so-called cabalistic tarots, however, is that none of them follow the scheme of the Sephir Yetzirah, the primary classic of ancient Hebrew astrological occultism. It is beyond my comprehension, considering that the Sephir Yetzirah is crystal clear in its astrological correspondences to the ciphers. For example, the Cabalistic Tarot says that Ghimel corresponds to the planet Venus while the Sephir Yetzirah states that Phay corresponds to Venus. The Sephir Yetzirah states that Resh corresponds to Mercury while the Cabalistic Tarot says that Bayt corresponds to Mercury. Such discrepancies go on and on, I know not why, especially since the Sephir Yetzirah sets forth a mathematically solid, logical basis for its astrological correspondences. The Sephir Yetzirah demonstrates a perfectly conceived cosmological basis for the Cabalistic ciphers that are the Hebrew alphabet. The incommensurability between the so-called Cabalistic Tarot arrangement and the arrangement of the Sephir Yetzirah is something that someone with the intellectual qualities M. DuQuette appears to posess should look into. It is certainly worth questioning.	2002-04-20

She makes some laughable errors and assumptions in Rune lore. Many instances can be cited, however, by way of example, her assignations of classical astrological signs to what she is calling the 12 palaces is totally arbitrary and distracting. Her knowledge of Old Norse is also evidently deficient, as shown by her calling the Hall of Vidar &quot;Landvithi.&quot; That is a glaring error. The home of Vidar is called Vithi, not Landvithi. Be that as it may, she thinks her &quot;Landvithi&quot; means &quot;white land&quot; or &quot;broad land.&quot; Vithi means neither. It means Forest Home. If she really understood the arrangement of the Halls, she calls palaces, she would have named 13, not 12. I might also suggest, rather than howling like a rabid dog, she try to devote more of her energy to delving, with a level head, into the real mysteries of the ancient tradition. The Norse-Germanic sages were far more evolved than her &quot;hair-raising&quot; CD might lead one to believe. The ancient tradition was not invented in Hollywood for the likes of Lon Chaney the wolf man. Perhaps Ms. Aswynn has missed her calling! Coming from this ancient Germanic culture that has never died, I, for one, find Ms. Aswynn's exposition of the material not only pathetically meagre, but remarkably funny. The Runes are cosmic mysteries that are closed to such self-important Hyenas like Ms. Aswynn. They can only be approached with a keen, clear, cool mind, stong and sharp enough to penetrate their infinite depths. Odin is the exemplar of the inspired aristocrat, not the howling lunatic. If Ms. Aswynn wishes to be a berserk, let her try. I doubt she has  the brains though. The English readers deserve better.	2002-04-09

Not that they aren't interesting, but, not to overlook the obvious, he does seem terribly full of himself and self-important. His mystifying self-myth is a hoot, to put it most politely. Then, I don't see how all that twaddle by Mme. Blavatsky got into his books unless her ghost also wanted to get into the act. That aside, some of the Toltec teachings are, in fact, in these books of Mares, and one can derive some benefit from reading them, as the information is arranged as a neat inventory. However, the non-inventory of Castaneda's books, I feel, is far more to the point. It was not meant to memorize all the Toltec material like a grocery list. Something smells peculiar about Mares: his books read somehow like neo-fascist \\"warrior\\" cult material. For true Toltec Technology, read Castaneda, Ken Eaglefeather, Florinda Donner-Grau and Taisha Abelar. Victor Sanchez has something very good to offer, and the two books attributed to the man called Tomas are also very good. To go one step further, of you are really interested in Toltec ways, it will also be to your advantage to study the Aztec calendar. There is profound wisdom therein. Also it is to your advantage to find out about Mexican Curanderismo. I will recommend a book called \\"The Woman Who Glows in the Dark\\" by Elena Avila. You can learn something very important in that book. Mares is a strange one; interesting but strange. Something is severly warped.	2002-04-05

This reviewer is a practicing psychic and researcher in the practical occult sciences for many years now. When the question of Casteneda's authenticity came up, it was submitted to this reviewer's oracle which has yet to be proven wrong. The answer was this: Don Juan did live, and Casteneda was his apprentice. However, it must be remembered that Casteneda was reporting and interpreting what Don Juan taught him, and that it took him many years to regain the memory of what Don Juan taught him. It is also true that Don Juan was interpreting what his teacher, Julian, taught him, and so on. Casteneda's books are not forgeries. If you remember, there were periods when Casteneda was very much in conflict and doubt about Don Juan. It is clear that DeMille is intent on debunking Casteneda. Those who choose to believe him are either intent on not understanding the essence of Don Juan's teachings as transmitted by Casteneda or are just plain gulls hoping not to appear like gulls. But that is their affair. What is most amazing, however, is that DeMille, with infinite know-how and arrogance, spent all that time construing all the garbage he needed to write this imbecilic book.

Do you think this tradition was ever so clearly defined? It never was. What we have of it are small fragments of something that was far vaster and more varied than any of these silly reviewers can let themselves imagine. The Norse-Germanic pagan faith arose out of the more ancient pan-Eurasian wiccan-shamanic world at the beginning of the Bronze Age, about 3000 BCE, and was practiced in many different forms over the region extending from Iceland to central Russia, from the Arctic to the Black Sea by the many different Germanic tribes and nations who spoke many different languages. Another way to see this is that the authentic practice of magic is above all an intensely personal creative matter. The greatest magicians, shamans, witches or whatever you would like to call them are artists who have their own ways. People such as these critical reviewers are looking for the familiar, something to hold on to. Do they want to think there is something like an orthodox Asatru religion? Sorry, but there isn't and there won't be. It is the very spirit of the Germanic people to foster the power of the individual. So this maligned book should be read with an open mind. Nothing that Fitch is saying is so outlandish. It offers something workable to the people. I have studied this &quot;tradition&quot; from all the existing sources and scholarly works in both English and German. I also have read the Eddas in the Old Norse as published by the Viking Society. The matter of the ancient Germanic pagan faith, aka Asatru, is far from closed, except maybe for those who need to pose as mystagogues - the aura of power is so seductive, you know. Maybe reviewers would do better to cultivate some openness of mind. Either the book speaks to them or doesn't, but it is imposture to condemn that about which one knows very little. I suggest to some of these people that they try writing a book. Do some research. &quot;The Rites of Odin&quot; isthere to be read. It has something to say. Read it and reflect on your own feelings.

As an initiate in Candomble, I find this book somewhat enjoyable except for some material with which I take issue. Ms. Dow certainly is in touch with the Brazilian spiritual scene. Understanding the depth and complexity of the traditions which this book quickly skirts over (Iansa axe!), however, I can only say it gives just a quicky peek through the door, and only really at Umbanda. The really deep tradition is Candomble, and this book doesn't even come close to it. The only real way to learn Umbanda or Macumba or whatever else from Brazil, not to mention Candomble, is to do it, and that means to get initiated in it, immerse oneself in it and live it. Therefore, it is not altogether a wise idea to do magic with the Orixas, especially Exu, without the proper  initiations. This is serious. I know some people think otherwise, but I would caution the reader. If you respect the tradition, get initiated. Exu deserves total respect and love. You cannot do anything without his blessing. He is the keeper of the keys of all the doors. Then the author expresses squeemishness about the sacrifices. Why then write about them? If she feels sentimental about her little &quot;furry beasties,&quot; that's fine. But I think it is neither respectful to talk of the sacrifices with such squeemishness, nor to apologise for them as she does to the non-initiated. If she eats animals, what makes it better if they are butchered in some stinking meat processing plant rather than killed in the sacred way? Anyway, I certainly wish Ms. Dow a lot of success in her attempts to describe the Umbanda. It's a huge undertaking. Hopefully she will find a better publisher than Llewellyn in the future.	2001-12-19

I would give Jackson's books fewer stars, except that the material is so good. He isn't all that good a writer, and it isn't all that easy to follow him. Often he throws ideas together in ways that are distracting and that make one wonder if he knows how to develope his subject. He would have benefited by having a good editor. Howbeit, what's most important is that he does present this deeply interesting material, and it is up to the reader to absorb and use it. If used in Wiccan practice, the material will bring a depth of experience that is most authentic and powerful. Nigel Jackson is very deeply immersed in the oldest form of Eurasian sacred shamanistic magic that there is - at least 200,000 years old, and it's still alive and kicking.	2001-11-18

Until then, I'll just do it the old way. I studied astrology for about seven years with the late Ivy Jacobson, who was without a doubt the best astrologer around and whose books, while difficult to find these days, are absolutely the best, with the rare exception of a couple of others, &quot;The Morinus System of Horoscope Interpretation,&quot; published by the American Federation of Astrologers, for example (J.B. Morin wrote his incomparably logical books in France in the 1660s). As a result of learning with Ivy Jacobson, the charts I've done have always been extremely accurate in their predictions, right to the day. Her methods are the most complete and precise there are. Most astrologers either overlook, or are completely ignorant of, much of what she has to teach. As the astrologer who directed me to her said to me: &quot;If you really want to learn astrology, go to Ivy Jacobson. She's the best teacher there is.&quot; So, dear readers of astrology, if you really want to learn this golden science to perfection, look up the American Federation of Astrologers, located in Tempe, Arizona, and ask them for a list of the books of Ivy Jacobson. Get whatever you can and gobble it up! I doubt, however, that they are printing her correspondence course. But good luck in your studies. Astrology is the very heart of the occult sciences, and worth every ounce of trouble it takes to learn.	2001-08-21

Perhaps one of the reviewers laughed this book off the shelf when it first appeared, but there were a lot of people who loved it, and who are delighted to see it in print again. It was one of the first books from which I learned to practice witchcraft. It contains some beautiful and powerful material. The author was completely sincere in what she wrote. There were some witches who were scandalized and jealous because of what she put into it. It's worth a look.	2001-08-05

When I first read it, I was very impressed and went on to read Waddell's &quot;Makers of Civilization in Race &amp; History.&quot; More recently I have been doing a lot of research into the Eddas, copies of which I have in the Old Norse as well as in the best English and German translations. Compared with these, Waddell's translation, if that's what you want to call it, of the Eddas is full of rubbish that he, no doubt, invented in order to promote the stupid Aryan racist agenda, so fashionable among certain members of the British aristocracy in the 1920s. It is very unfortunate, mainly because he does touch on the thesis that the Norse material originated in the ancient Middle East, something not entirely at variance with Snorri Sturluson's Ynglinga Saga. L. A. Waddell was a very unbalanced, hot-headed and eccentric amateur archaeologist and writer in the field of Sumerian antiquities. He came to full blown conclusions far far too easily, considering that he was writing in the 1920s and 1930s, and that to date only a very small fraction of the Sumerian literary relics have been excavated, let alone translated. He writes in a style that is aimed at cowing his ignorant public. I would suggest that anyone who reads his work be very critical and take much with a liberal grain of salt. Waddell's &quot;Makers of Civilization&quot; is a better work than his &quot;British Edda.&quot; In it, he reconstructs the entire Sumerian king lists with the help of such texts as the Vayu Purana, but there even, be careful.	2001-07-29

His German is extroadinarily beautiful. Trakl was a magnificent poet; I would say one of my absolutely favorite poets. His techniques are marvelous. He comes from, and surpasses, the lineage of such master technicians as Edgar Allen Poe, and Charles Baudelaire. He wrote poetry as if he were composing music, modulating colors and emotional content rather than tones and harmonies. One has the sense that he was divinely inspired. His work is miraculous.	2001-07-28

The author's &quot;Master Mandala&quot; is a work of inspired magical genius. While I am a natural clairvoyant, and don't need to work with the magic mirror scrying technique discovered by Poke Runyon, the book's author, it is this scrying technique that makes the book so uniquely valuable to all those who are not natural clairvoyants and who want to see spirits. Be that as it may, Runyons arrangement of the Goetic spirits and angels of the Shemhamephoresh is the best I've come across. I admire his creative and scientific approach to the Goetic and Angelic material, and completely agree with his use of self-hypnotic techniques.	2001-07-28

There is nothing else so thorough, detailed and scientifically  arranged as this. It consists of 10 large groups of exercises. Once these are mastered, the practitioner is fully able to go on to any and all of the most advanced high magical practices. The techniques, carefully outlined in this book, are universally applicable. Bardon was, without doubt, one of the greatest magicians of the 20th century. I cannot recommend any book more highly.	2001-07-28

This one does have some interesting material, as do all her books. But it has plenty that is not universally agreed upon, and it has absolutely nothing at all to say about the deeper, and most important secrets of Palo. Palo is not a standardized tradition. What you know and what you do depends on what house you are coming from. The houses are secret societies. You can't expect to learn anything without being in a house. It's as simple as that. No good Palero is going to make the secrets public. By their very nature, that would be insane. Not that I am showing disrespect to Lydia Cabrera. Her books are more or less good. I like some parts of her &quot;La Regla Kimbisa.&quot; But a word of caution to you who want to dabble with African magic: there is a lot that will never be put into writing. Dabbling, when you don't know what you are dealing with, and especially in Palo, is a very fool hardy and dangerous thing to do. You don't know what you don't know. A lot of the older Paleros question what got into Lydia Cabrera to write what she did. Palo is closed to the uninitiated.	2001-07-02

Face and body reading is used not only in fengshui, but as an adjunct to Chinese astrological reading as well. By reading one's face and body, as well as energy, one's element, among other things can be determined and, thus, used for adjusting the fengshui of one's living and working environment.

I have the Viking Society's bi-lingual edition of 1903 with the entire text in Old Norse, but with many obscure names left untranslated. For the information of the reviewer who thinks Gandalfr means Wind Elf, it doesn't; it means Wand Elf. Vindalfr means Wind Elf. What is more critical than whether names are translated or not is that they be kept in the order in which they are found in the original Norse text. All of the lists of names in the Eddas were deliberately arranged. For this reason modern translations that rearrange the names for stylistic reasons impoverish the original texts; I am referring mainly to Auden's translation which is nothing more than an elegant butchery!	2001-06-26

In some details it is interesting. In others it is questionable. I find the author's tendency to obscure and pie some of her information very annoying. She tauntingly hints about secret and allegedly difficult I-Ching astrological divination methods that, in fact are not so difficult to learn. There are a number of such methods. They are amazing in what they reveal. The author hopelessly mystifies this area. Too bad she doesn't share it properly. If she cared to write about these methods, instead of confusing them, she should have been open and explained them clearly and completely so that the readers could have learned them. On the other hand, she should have said nothing. What is the point of mystifying the subject? Something else in the book I found highly questionable in light of Taoist sorcery is the ways she recommends using mirrors. She can fill your house with bad spirits that way. Notwithstanding the above, and the often supercilious tone in which she writes, the book does have some very good material that makes it well worth exploring.	2001-06-06
