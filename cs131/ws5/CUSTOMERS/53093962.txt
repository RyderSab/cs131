Books for Youth (Awards))	Books	5	47	47	N	Y	Fun, well-written book for middle-school  students.	The book is well written and well illustrated.  I think it would work best for kids from about 12 to 14.  It starts with basic codes, and moves to more complicated ones, but always makes how they function quite clear.  I list the ages to give a sensibility of the book; it is not \\"dumbed down\\".  The book could be used by younger kids with some adult help, or for kids who are really interested.  It would also be a good starting point for high school students.<br /><br />It tries hard to be as interactive as possible, always posing questions.  It is a \\"practical\\" book, focusing on codes that students can use, as opposed to trying to be say a history book, that would delve deeply into say the WW II Enigma code.  From the rating, you can tell I enjoyed it.	2005-07-07

In particular, he loves baseball at its purist.  Pure because there are no guaranteed contracts, no established stars, just college players who see their goal so close and so badly want to make the next step. Each game, and each athlete, is an adventure. It will be fun over the years to see which of the players chronicled in this book become stars in the years to come.	2004-06-09

It walks students very carefully through the basics of electric circuits.  What I liked in particular was that the book provides examples of things like: &quot;why would you place resistors in parallel&quot; or &quot;why would you place resistors in a series&quot;. <br />It has a CD in the back that I haven't tried yet, but looks interesting.  The CD has more experiments with circuits using a simulator or two.	2000-10-24

But the book does a great step-by-step progression, reminding of you things you've already learned when you're doing new topics.  It explains different ways to do things, and why you might want to do them differently.   Finally, she points out the potential pitfalls of some approaches.<br />My only critique is that sometimes crucial &quot;hints&quot; are buried in the middle of chapters.	2000-10-12

That's neither good nor bad, it just depends what you're looking for.  If you want to find ways to apply computer programs in a first-years course -- this ain't it.  There are probably only a few cases in which the topics are close enough to first-year physics to be relevant (multiple waves on a string; contrasting an idealized model of a pendulum with a &quot;real-one&quot;).<br />Having said that, I give the book some pluses for covering a wide range of physics and mathematical topics, and a bit of a minus for writing that can be fairly opaque.	2000-10-12

It would be nice to get a compare/contrast, since templates are used in many products.  Why choose one and not the other? No go.  A chapter called &quot;Using web-based front page components&quot; is the place where templates are &quot;explained&quot; in 4 pages.  What that chapter should be called is: &quot;Front page components that don't require FP extensions&quot;.  <br />The themes section has a whole chunk of information on color theory.  Why? There are good books on basic web design -- and color theory would seem to apply to more than just themes.	2000-10-12

The publisher's text on Amazon when it describes what's in the book starts the list with: &quot;hands-on robot projects, with complete building  instructions....&quot; I had hoped that would be a major focus of the book  -- a series of &quot;cool robots&quot; that I could build.  Instead, the  robot in the book is quite simple, and not additive to the multiple robots  LEGO describes in its various kits.  The programming language with the kits  is fairly simple and flexible -- I wanted more robot ideas, since I find  the physical construction of robust robots to be the challenging part (as  you may guess, I come from Microsoft, not Boeing). On the other hand, if  you're a software junky and want to see a half-dozen semi to fairly  well-baked programming language alternatives to what LEGO offers, this book  may be for you.	1999-11-07

The pluses are that this book covers a lot, esp. for something called &quot;running access 2000&quot;.  e.g. it covers a good amount of programming. It's also clearly written. My one critique is  the examples, which are integral to the book.  The book skips between three  sets of examples.  The examples have a lot of forms, and some can take some  analysis.  I would have prefered one example that was built up in a more  consistent fashion, one one main example with other minor ones if  essential. My minor critiques would be that (a) chapters are by listed  techniques (e.g. Visual Basic Fundamentals) whereas a subhead (automating  data entry) might have been as relevant.(b) I think he is least clear (or  too terse) on designing a &quot;good&quot; database (like how to set up  tables and relationships) (c) a &quot;for more info&quot; bibliography  would be invaluable (e.g. a great VB book). Finally, and this is *not* a  critique, just an observation, this book is NOT a reference (lord knows how  many volumes a reference would take....)	1999-09-10

The book spends a good amount of time teaching non-programming topics (surprising, given it's title).  And I learned much more, both in programming and non-programming topics, in the  &quot;running microsoft access 2000&quot; book.  &quot;Programming access  2000&quot; really flies over a lot of programming topics.  For example, it  spends 27 pages on &quot;forms&quot;, which of course includes data entry.   &quot;Running Microsoft Access&quot; has 62 pages on using VB in forms, but  also a chapter on using macros for data entry, and another chapter partly  dedicated to the topic, and a whole chapter dedicated to VB fundamentals.   In other words, probably 3 times as much.  In fairness, Programming Access  covers many more topics, like working with other MSFT applications, but I  thought the book would focus on the fundamentals of creating a great Access  Application, not quick run throughs of many topics.	1999-09-10

But unfortunately, it is not as well written as the first volume (which I think is superbly written).  The writing is not as clear; the examples can be a  bit murky; and the book does feel a little &quot;miscellaneous&quot; at  times. However, since Director documentation is sparse, this book may well  prove vital to your needs.  I used it in particular for parent/child object  coding.	1999-09-04

The book did a good job of walking me through many of the facets of Director.  Be forewarned -- it just covers the basics (at best) of LINGO.  I would have loved it if each  chapter had 3 or 4 more projects that one could try (even if they weren't  documented at all in the book) to give one more ideas of how to use  Director efficiently and effectively.	1999-04-26

It's not very specific about curriculum design nor technology, if that's what you are looking for. It does a pretty job of citing other research and case-studies of  implementation.  It also seems to state a lot of &quot;basics&quot;: like  &quot;The study guide should do more than merely present subject matter. It  should contain directions and guidance for the students...&quot; (page 79).   This doesn't seem very insightful nor specific to distance education.	1999-04-19

Ironically, I wish it focused on the tax implications of losses (to be expected in startups) as much profits :).  I also found some of the writing  confusing -- like in covering LLCs, it compares some facets of them to  other corporate before really explaining how they work.  But I liked the  book, thinking it basically helps me have a more informed conversation with  a lawyer, which I think is essential (since regulations change so fast, and  can be state-specific).	1999-04-15

Probably inevitably, it covers all these topics at a quite brisk pace -- on the other hand, it has a good  bibliography.  The book is dry and seems pretty focused on corporate market  place.  It is much more focused on &quot;courseware design&quot; than  technology.  So I found it quite good at what it chose to accomplish: a  broad &quot;cookbook&quot; for courseware design.	1999-04-15

The author fairly eloquently advances a bunch of opinions, but (1) how about backing it up with research about what testing methodologies &quot;work&quot; or what the impact of these  methodologies are and (2) how about some sense of how a teacher could  actually implement these methodologies that are more &quot;free-form&quot;?  His examples of a Harvard University exam are nice, but perhaps a little  daunting.	1999-04-15

Admittedly, I bought this book with one focus: learning about DSL -- but then the second topic (after ATM) listed on the book was DSL. DSL makes for 6 pages total in this book and the book says the modems will cost suppliers  $1500 and therefore is skeptical about DSL.  Therefore, I guess, the book  doesn't even really bother to explain DSL, instead focusing more pages on  ISDN. I just feel a book that claims on its cover that it &quot;Covers all  the hot technologies: Internet, wireless, ATM, DSL...&quot; should do so.  I didn't bother reading other sections since the DSL coverage was limited  and inaccurate/dated.	1999-02-23
