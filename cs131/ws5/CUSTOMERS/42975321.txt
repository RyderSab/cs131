James Bond is much more realistic as his closest escapes come from his cunning not a crazy gadget.  He is more lifelike and easier to relate to than the megastud actuion hero of the movies.  The plot is tautly woven, and the mystery begins on the first pages with the murder of Strangways.  Fleming shoves a lot of information the reader's way, and it is up to you to decide what you believe at the final encounter.  Doctor No is also great because it was written in 1958.  Its Jamaica is one still part of Britain and untouched by tourism.  Nearby Cuba is a friendly nation, and all James needs is a trusty gun and a beautiful girl.  There were problems then, but they were much simpler than those of today, and it is refreshing to read about them	2005-03-23

The convict past of Australia is not a topic that has much written about it, and Hughes' book will become the benchmark for all to come.  Hughes has made the past come alive.  The characters are larger than life: the man flogged 2000 times, the prison warden who walked among his prisoners and insulted them, etc.  The best part of the history for me was Hughes' continual use of primary source material, such as songs of the time period and journals of the convicts.  These items, along with the great writing made it very hard to put down.  Highly recommended for those interested in traveling to Australia, or those wanting to know more of its history	2004-10-24
US	42975321	R31EM3K6BAT9SM	0375701427	79852712	American Pastoral: American Trilogy (1) (Vintage International)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Powerful and Personal	American Pastoral is a beautifully-written epic of the American family.  The protagonist is Swede Levov, an ex-high school athlete, and the plot revolves around his dealing with a tragedy.  That tragedy is his daughter's bombing of a general store in their rural town.  The novel begins when Swede is 70 and gradually works its way back to the time of the bombing, and then forward to 5 years after the bombing.  This narrative form allows the reader to experience all of Swede's emotions.  The novel deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize, it is a winning depiction of American home life, and realistically relationships between fathers and daughters.  Roth's characters are very true to life.  Definitely recommended.	2003-11-29

Bond must defeat Le Chiffre at the baccarat tables to foil a plot.  Thankfully Fleming explains the rules of baccarat for the uninitiated.  The main problem with the novel is its predictability.  Casino Royale is the only Bond book never made into a Bond movie, I can understand why.  You can't make a movie interesting if the only tension is a roll of dice.  It's not hard to guess that James will win at baccarat.  After James wins, however, the novel does not end.  It meanders for around 90 pages.  In Casino Royale, James Bond says love is parabolic, small at the start, fiery in the middle, and small at the end.  The same would be true of Casino Royale.  The novel is well-written with tight prose, but Fleming's plot couldn't sustain my interest.  I still enjoyed and will continue with the series.	2003-11-29

But, Lahiri forgot to write a plot.  The Namesake, in essence, is a chronicle of the failed relationships of the protagonist.  There is no tension, there is no climax.  Lahiri's descriptions of the quirky family Gogol Ganguli comes from are what makes the book possible to get through.  Lahiri makes Nikolai Gogol an overriding theme of the novel, the main character is named after him, and his work is sporadically referenced, but no seminal assertion about Gogol is made.  Just like Gogol's mother's saris, he is just part of the setting, nothing more.  The writer Gogol is the namesake in the title, but the book would have been essentially the same if references to Gogol the author had been omitted.  The Namesake has glimpses of greatness, and Lahiri's description and characterization paired with a gripping plot would make a great novel.  But, The Namesake is not that novel.  It is just long, and flat.	2003-11-06

It begins in Asia Minor (apparently the part of Turkey where Greeks live), moves on to Smyrna, then ends up in Detroit.  Overall, it is the story of how a gene traveled from the narrator's grandparents to him/her.  How this gene travels is never explained, but owing to the novel's subject matter it has something to do with intermarriage.  My favorite section of the novel was the beginning.  We learn about the narrator's Greek grandparents.  They are hilarious and seem lifted from My Big Fat Greek Wedding.  They fade in importance, and the narrative shifts to their son, Milton.  The novel is chock-full of hilarious anecdotes, and on the whole is very funny.  Milton has two children: Chapter Eleven and Calliope/Cal, the novel's narrator.  Calliope is born a girl, and grows up that way, but as the novel is titled Middlesex one assumes that soon we will find she is actually a hermaphropdite.  For me, the novel became less and less interesting the more we learned about Calliope and her life.  The book becomes quite graphic when describing her sexual experiences (at 14), and her realization she is actually a male.  Middlesex is anti-climactic, the conclusion cannot live up to the splendid narrative of the grandparents.  The only thought-provoking theme raised in Middlesex is that of destiny, and what (if anyhting) we can do to fight it.  On the whole, Middlesex is a good book, but falls short in comparison to other Pulitzer winners.  Recommended to those wanting to learn more about Greeks and hermaphroditism.	2003-09-26

But, The Teeth of the Tiger is just over 400 pages, has 4 storylines, and stars Jack Ryan's son(Jack Jr.) and his cousins the Caruso's.  The reader is never given the information about how the Caruso's are related to Jack Jr.  The beginning is very slow, with the Caruso twins sent to start training for some special government agency, that their cousin just happens to be working for.  Then while at a mall, the Caruso brothers happen to be carrying concealed guns where Arab terrorists start shooting everyone in sight.  Amazingly, all the terrorists are sent to \\"paradise\\" and the Caruso's find out what they have been training for.  Then they jet off to do their missions in Europe, and the book still stays pretty boring.  The Teeth of the Tiger is definitely not one of Clancy's best.  It seems rushed and has some obvious editing mistakes.  In any case, it's hard to put down, and a quick read, but that's about all that's in its favor.	2003-09-02

I have known many Mormons, but not known anything about their faith, and Under the Banner of Heaven is described on the cover as a story of a violent faith.  But, this subtitle is what causes the book's downfall.  Krakauer had too many ideas for what to write about, and the result is an amalgamation of different, mainly unconnected topics.  He starts by describing a murder by fundamentalist Mormons, then writes about a fundamentalist community, then writes about Elizabeth Smart, then moves on to the origins of Mormonism.  This cycle continues throughout the rest of the book.  Different topics are introduced but there is no cohesion, they are never convincingly related to each other.  The information within the book is interesting and enlightening, but the book as a whole does not work.  Essentially, Krakauer strung together random, interesting facts about Mormonism, and called it a book.  There were parts where I had no idea what relevance a topic had to the surrounding chapters.  For an overview of most topics relating to the Mormon Church, this is a good book, but don't come looking for a book as taut and driven as Into Thin Air.	2003-08-21
US	42975321	RE9FUJCUBB658	0375403736	564250926	Family Matters	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Exceptional	Family Matters, at its core, is a story about family.  The family at the center of the novel are the Chenoys, with  parents Yezad and Roxana and children Jehangir and Murad.  The story revolves around the effects of the Chenoy's extended family (Aunt Coomy, Uncle Jal and Grandfather Nariman)upon the Chenoys.  At the story's heart is the injury of Nariman, and how Jal and Coomy feel they cannot take care of him, and pawn him off to the Chenoys who have tight finances and a two-room flat.  Interwoven are vignettes about Nariman's girlfriend Lucy; his wife and Jal, Coomy, and Roxana's mother Yasmin; Yezad's boss at work; and the Chenoy family's neignbors.  These vignettes serve to further our knowledge of the different characters.  The result is a novel where one feels as if they know the characters intimately, their weaknesses, their strengths, and their desires.  Family Matters is a novel everyone can relate to.  Everyone has had money problems, everyone has had problems with their relatives.  Mistry manages to distill the experience of being a part of a family into a very well-written novel.	2003-07-20

Atonement has been described as a \\"symphonic novel.\\"  This is due to the fact that the novel has four parts, as a symphony has four movements; Atonement is not a novel of any great lyrical quality.  It is one of the few works that I have read, that managed to raise expectations and suspense to a high level, and then not remotely deliver.  In the engrossing Part 1, our heroine Briony sees her sister (Cecilia) and her family's servant (Robbie) in some overtly sexual situations.  She secretly loves Robbie so this makes her upset, and she decides to get revenge.  When Briony's cousin, Lola, is attacked later that day, Briony pins the blame on Robbie, and he is shipped off to prison.  Predictably, Briony will now atone for her wrongs.  But Part 2 begins, and with no transition whatsoever, the reader is whisked off to World War II, and the British Army's retreat from Dunkirk.  Robbie is no longer in prison, he is in the army.  Then, predictably he retreats and goes home to England.  Part 3: Briony is now a nurse and she treats wounded soldiers.  At the end of Part 3 she meets up with Cecilia and Robbie and tells them that she will atone for her wrongs.  Then Part 3 ends.  Part 4 begins 60 years later, in the present day.  Briony is old and muses about how she has never atoned for what she died.  She has written a book called, you guessed it, Atonement, in which she atones, but she has never published this book.<br />Part 1 of Atonement showed great promise.  It was tautly written, and ended with suspense.  How was Briony going to deal with what she had done?  However, in the remaining 3 parts, this fundamental question is never answered!  The final 3 parts skip around to different locales and seem to be different novels sharing the same characters.  They bear no resemblance to the themes in Part 1.  After raising my expectations to a high level, Atonement did not deliver.  It likely has the least-fulfilling conclusion, and resolution that I have ever seen in a novel.  Don't come to Atonement expecting a plot dealing with atonement, because the plot doesn't deal with it.	2003-06-22

Rowling, in my mind, had a lot of expectations to live up to with Book 5.  I enjoyed Books 1-4 and have re-read them countless times in the time between the release of the Goblet of Fire and now.  Mainly, I was hoping Rowling would stick to the formula of Summer with the Dursleys/School at Hogwarts and not throw in any trash like the Triwizard Tournemant or moronic house-elves.  She stuck to the classic formula very well in Order of the Phoenix, but still seems fixated on writing about house-elves.  Book 5 is remarkable because it explains and answers many pressing questions from the previous books.  In my opinion, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is well worth reading, it is a great addition to the series.  Someone does die, and that person is a main character, and an adult.	2003-06-22

The narrator gives us many small and random facts about zoology, then proceeds to detail his interest in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, and how he practices all three religions at the same time.  Not exactly gripping writing, or similar to the survival story described on the back jacket.  But, near page 100, Life of Pi abruptly transitions.  Our hero, Pi, leaves India with his family and their zoo animals, (his family runs a zoo) on a cargo ship bound for a new life in Canada.  But, the cargo ship soon sinks and Pi is left on a life raft with a tiger.  Now, the real book begins.  Pi must survive on a small life raft with a massive tiger.  The meat of the novel is Pi explaining his activities while on the high seas.  But, as the novel continues, his exploits change from the normal, collecting water when it rains; to the hard to believe, going blind and meeting fellow survivors.  Predictably, Pi survives, and the author's purpose of writing the novel becomes clear when he is interrogated.  Life of Pi can be read two ways, as a exciting survival story with a bad beginning; or as an allegory for the two different ways in which events can play out, the reader not knowing which way actually happened, and which way was fantasy.  Because of the questions it raises, Life of Pi would be an excellent discussion book for a book club, however, it is enjoyable when read alone as well.	2003-06-10

In Citizens, Simon Schama sets out to write a modern history of the French Revolution in the style of the narrative histories of the nineteenth century. In this goal he succeeds admirably. The narration is well written, entertaining, and always pertinent to the historical analysis. However, the problem lies in Mr. Schama's historical analysis itself. He portrays the aristocracy in ancien regime France as a vibrant, progressive, commercial backbone of France. Supposedly, the revolution destroyed itself when it turned to popular violence against the enlightened nobles. Schama demonizes the peasantry by portraying their actions without motives. The real sufferings and grievances of the peasantry under the nobles are ignored, while the problems of the aristocracy under the revolutionary government are given a vivid description. Furthermore, the book abruptly ends after the fall of the Jacobins. While this may be understandable so that the book does not become too long, it smacks of self-interest for the author. Perhaps the book was cut sort because the Directory period showed that a revolutionary government by the upper class also did not work, although Schama would have you believe that it was France's only hope. Still, most of the rest of the book is both spot-on and entertaining, so I find it hard not to recommend it. Read this book for a well-written overview of the Revolution, but take the book's claims with a grain of salt.	2003-06-07

The stories are all heartwarming, happy and most of the time, hilarious.  I was surprised to see that Interpreter of Maladies had won the Pulitzer Prize, because it is not really an example of literature. In my opinion, its redeeming quality is its entertainment value.  The only major issue discussed is the immigrant experience, however, this has been done many times, and done better.  Lahiri has a sure talent for crafting smart and witty stories, and I will await her novel scheduled for release later in this year.  However, don't come to Interpreter of Maladies looking for a life-altering experience or for any enduring lessons.  This collection is best enjoyed as entertainment.	2003-06-07

The book begins with two twins being separated at birth.  These brothers, not knowing they are borthers, lead parallel lives, sharing the same friends and living in the same city for most of their lives.  Much of the novel is drivel that details the brothers lives at boarding school, in college, and their jobs.  Amazingly, they are drawn back to Hartford, Connecticut where they become established businessman.  Improbably, they both decide to run for governor, and this is when the coincidences start to pile up.  Be warned, if you want your books to have a semblance that they could actually happen, stay away from Sons of Fortune.  However, if taken as pure, stupid entertainment, Sons of Fortune can be an enjoyable book, and one that's hard to put down.	2003-05-28

The story concerns the Buddenbrook family and their life as prosperous merchants in Lubeck in the 1800s.  At the beginning, the main characters are Johann and his son Johann, but as the novel continues both die and the focus shifts to the son of younger Johann, Thomas.  All the characters are lifelike, each with their own distinct personalities.  The most impressive facet of the novel is how true to life it is.  The translation is also excellent, the novel is readable and there are few passages that are tough to decipher.  Buddenbrooks is quite long, but with the exceptions of some dry parts near the middle it is an exciting and easy read.	2003-05-23

After reading through a 100 or so pages, one would assume that the rest of the novel would follow this plot.  But, that is not the case.<BR>After the hostage crisis is concluded, halfway through the novel, the book abruptly changes gears.  It now is dealing with a terrorist killing assorted famous people to bring about a peace in Palestine.  <BR>While the book is a quick read, and hard to put down, it suffers from a terrible plot.  Actually, Executive Power is essentially two stories, the hostage crisis and the Palestinian terrorism lumped together to form a novel.  There is no clear connection between these plots either.  Executive Power also has a depressingly bad ending, almost all loose ends are not wrapped up, and it is also confusing.  Executive Power succeeds as a thriller/suspense book but fails miserably as a novel.  Definitely not one of Vince Flynn's best, look to The Third Option and Term Limits instead.	2003-05-12

To make their son elegant and refined, the Marquis and the Marquise Matsugae send their son, Kiyoaki to study with the ancient, noble Ayakura.  It is there that Kiyoaki and Satoko meet.  When the novel takes place, the two have never had any feelings for each other.  But, the news that Satoko is engaged to marry an Imperial Prince causes Kiyoaki to realize that what was in front of him all along, Satoko, was the love of his life.  So, they embark upon an affair.<br />I read this novel for pleasure, not for insight, and as such did not pick up on the underlying messages Mishima was trying to impart to the reader.  However, this book is still a worthwhile read even if one does not fully understand it.  The writing was very easy to read, and very beautiful; leading me to believe that the translator did his job well.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-26

It had an interesting premise, and looked to be unlike any book I'd read before.  I've read histories of people and places, but never of ingredients.  I checked it out skeptically, and was pleasantly surprised.<BR>Kurlansky is a very talented writer, he manages to make salt suspenseful.  The book's purpose is to examine how salt affected the history of the world.  He succeeds in this.  However, the history is not really coherent, it doesn't really flow.  Salt is essentially a collection of vignettes.  These vignettes are grouped in chronological order.  The first part of the book deals with salt in China and Rome.   Part 2 concerns salt's effect in the Middle Ages and the wars of independence.  Part 3 concludes the history by examining salt in modern times.<BR>The main failing of this extensively researched account is Kurlansky attempts to link salt to every major world event.  According to him, dissatisfaction with the salt tax led to the American and French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution came to be because of salt, and salted foods allowed the world to be explored.  Nonetheless, the history is accessible and a fun to read, even if some of the author's conclusions are a bit off base.	2003-04-23

Kawabata wrote a short novel, but it isn't a quick read.  Give yourself time to ponder what meanings there are in the everyday events, and to savor the beautiful images presented. Dialogue is hard to follow because Kawabata does not identify the speaker, so the reader must infer from what is said who the speaker is.	2003-04-20

But, Buchanan surprised me with his even-handed writing style.  He describes both points of view on most issues, even though it's obvious that he is biased towards the conservative point of view.  All of his assertions are backed up by fact.<br />In The Death of the West Buchanan first presents his thesis.  Western civilization as we know it is dying.  Because of plunging birthrates, the populations of European countries will begin to decline, just as countries in the Middle East and Asia are rapidly increasing their populations.  He foretells that America will soon be overrun by immigrants that do not want to be American, they want to take advantage of its freedoms to further themselves.  He believes that this is happening now, and if something isn't done to stop it, the America we love will disappear.<br />The book's failing ocurrs when Buchanan tries to link the decline in birthrates to the loss of religion and morals caused by the influence of Communism.  It seems some haven't come out of the McCarthy era yet.<br />He goes to describe how the Communists are de-christianizing America, and making war on its past, all so a Communist state in America can be establshed.  This is a little far-fetched.  However, Buchanan does make some good points, showing that special interests such as the NAACP are erasing America's history because it does not conform to its narrow definition of what is right and wrong.<br />Overall, the book is good, well-written, and backed up by facts.  Recommended to Conservatives who are despairing the current State of our Union.	2003-04-08

The biography has a wide scope, it covers just about everything relating to the Tsar and the Tsaritsa from the time of their marriage to the time of their death.  You don't often see biographies of two people in one book.  But to understand Nicholas, you must understand Alexandra.  And, by the end of this book, you will have a better undserstanding of why events played out the way they did.	2003-03-17
US	42975321	RKCZOQPBKXN1Q	0399149724	619984812	The Confessor	Books	5	128	133	N	N	A Thrilling Read	Each year I look forward to Daniel Silva's new thriller.  The Confessor was worth the wait.  After starting off slowly, the novel quickly picks up steam.  <br />As is usual with a suspense novel, there are a few plots to keep track of, three in The Confessor.  Though it is hard to remember the various characters at first, they quickly become integral parts of the novel.  Silva develops his characters wonderfully.  None are faultless, but all are a joy to read about.<br />Readers of The Kill Artist and The English Assassin will be familiar with The Confessor's protagonist, Gabreil Allon.  This book takes place a few years after the events of The English Assassin.  Gabriel is restoring a fresco in a Venetian church when Ari Shamron, his sometimes spymaster, comes to him with a job.  Gabriel's friend and fellow spy, Benjamin Stern, had been killed.  Shamron wants Gabriel to investigate the death.  Gabriel reluctantly accepts and goes off to Munich.  It is there that the book really begins.  <br />Gabriel uncovers evidence that Stern had gone to Italy while in the process of researching a book that he (Stern) was writing.  As the novel progresses, Gabriel investigates and unearths a conspiracy in the Catholic Church.  Like all other Silva novels, The Confessor has a healthy dose of breathless chase scenes, exotic European locales, and multiple assumed identities.  The Confessor will be enjoyed by all fans of Silva's earlier work, and those with an interest in international intrigue.	2003-03-04

When she gets her tarot cards read she is told that she will be getting married within the next sixteen months! The problem is, she doesn't even have a boyfriend! And so begins the search for Mr. Right. Will it be gorgeous Gus? Or flirtatious Daniel? Or maybe even her new co-worker Jed? <br />I really enjoyed this book, even though so parts were a bit predictable, like the ending. However, it was still well written and very funny. Marian Keyes developes a wonderful, intricate plot that will keep you coming back for more. If you enjoy humor, romance, and a touch of mystery, you will love this book!	2003-02-26

The Sigma Protocol starts off quick and never lets up.  The synopsis on the back cover barely goes into the masterfully crafted plot.  However, the plot is similar to another Ludlum novel, The Matarese Countdown.  In both, a young man unearths a conspiracy bent on world domination and trying to kill him as well as dissenting voices within the organization, Sigma.  The young man, Ben Hartman is ably assisted by Anna Navarro in rooting out who the conspirators are.  The plot takes us to many locations: Zurich, Vienna, Buenos Aires to name a few, all the while leading up to an exciting conclusion.  I picked up the book to read on an airplane, and it was perfect.  Not really a novel that makes you think, but who goes into reading a Robert Ludlum novel looking for insight anyway?  The Sigma Protocol is gripping and will not disappoint.	2003-02-24

Even though you know what the ending will probably be, you'll want to keep reading.  Marion Sharpe and her mother, who live in a isolated mansion known as the Franchise, are accused of kidnapping and beating a teenager, Betty Kane.  They say that they have never seen her before, and enlist a local attorney, Robert Blair, to defend them.  He has never handled a case like this before, but resolves to do it.  As the book progresses, Blair decides to conduct his own investigation into Betty Kane.  He fervently believes in the Sharpes' innocence, and works to find gaps in Betty's story.  Even though it seems like something straight out of Masterpiece Theatre, The Franchise Affair is exciting and hard to put down.	2003-02-23

Skipping Christmas, A Painted House, The Brethren and The Summons were very forgettable. The King of Torts is different. It is a rags to riches story in which you can't help cheering for the protagonist, Clay Carter. As the novel begins Clay is stuck in a dead-end job as a public defender. In a hard to believe plot leap, Clay is contacted by a &quot;fireman,&quot;(a person hired by big corporations implicated in lawsuits to get a settlement) Max Pace who gives him the opportunity to make millions of dollars. Clay gleefully accepts this opportunity and is soon a hotshot multimillionaire with a private jet, house on St. Barts, Porsche and bimbo girlfriend. But of course, this couldn't last... The King of Torts seems to me as an illustration of the contempt in which Grisham holds the profession of mass tort lawyers. It's a quick, great read that will be sure to please fans of Grisham's and also those just looking for a thrilling read.	2003-02-23

In a word, Noble House is amazing.  In its breadth and scope it is unsurpassed by any novel I have ever read.  It is gripping from the Prologue where you introduced to the main character, Ian Dunross to the awe-inspiring conclusion.  The characters are all well-formed, and you feel like you know them intimately.  Their faults and good qualities are all known by the reader.  Don't be discouraged by the book's weight and length.  It will fly by.  Even though the book weighs a pound, it is very hard to put down.  This is a book that makes me want to tell anyone who can read that they should read this book.	2003-01-11

At the explosive beginning you are introduced to the characters, all of whom you begin to care for. After the terrorists take control of the mansion and the party guests within it, the book's beauty begins to show. For most of the book, it is as if time has stopped. Real world cares do not matter anymore. Life is lived, and that is it. Highly recommended	2003-01-11
US	42975321	R35URK5QK41XN8	0679735909	627682796	Possession	Books	4	5	5	N	N	Difficult to Read, but Enjoyable	Possession is an amazing novel, written like a historical text, but still a very enjoyable read.  The story concerns Roland and Maud, two scholars.  Roland discovers a letter written by the fictional poet he studies, Randolph Ash, that threatens to turn the public's perception of Ash upside down.  It is a love letter from Ash to Christabel LaMotte, the poetess (also fictional) studied by Maud.  Ash was supposedly happily married and Christabel supposedly lesbian.  The novel follows Roland and Maud's search to find out more about the romance between Ash and LaMotte.  Thrown into the mix are other Ash and LaMotte scholars hoping to discover the truth for themselves.  <BR>   Possession is a very interesting read, even though it is difficult.  The author, A.S. Byatt, drops many literary allusions into the text that I did not understand.  Someone with a knowledge of English poetry would take more from the novel than I did.  Adding to the novel's authenticity are poems supposedly written by Ash and LaMotte that introduce each chapter.<BR>   Possession is a difficult read.  It is a long book that takes a significant amount of time.  Many passages will need to be reread for a complete understanding.  However, it is ultimately rewarding and you will have a sense of accomplishment once you finish it.  Recommended, for those who have the time to fully appreciate it.	2003-01-01
US	42975321	R38X7XZZM5ONUJ	0066214122	245555180	Prey	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Good but not Great	Prey starts out slow with the domestic life of the main character.  It is only about 100 pages into the book that the plot begins to get interesting.  Be sure to stick with it even though the first few chapters are a bore.  Once Prey starts going it is hard to put down, and many plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat.  There are, however, some major flaws.  The book's subject matter seems very far-fetched.  It is hard to imagine that something similar to the events in the book could actually happen.  Also, the science that lays the foundation for the book was very complex and hard for me to understand.  Next, the ending is confusing and leaves a fair number of questions unanswered.  Prey will be enjoyed by fans of Crichton, like me, but those not familiar with his work would be advised to pass Prey by.  He has written better books, that are more interesting and easier to understand.	2002-12-19

I had read it a few years earlier and had only taken the story in, not the deeper meaning the author intended.  At the outset, the constant themes and symbols are explained, though not in very much detail.  Then summaries of the chapters are included, though this would only be useful to someone that hadn't read the book as they are just summaries, nothing more. These \\"notes\\" would be helpful to someone reading for pleasure and wanting to understand the symbolism.  It would be invaluable to someone in high school or college needing to review the chapters to write an essay, or need to understand the symbolism for discussions.	2002-12-19

It chronicles the fortunes of the Medici family from when its first leader, Cosimo comes to renown in Florence in 143 to when heirless Gian Gastone dies in 1737.  The history is very interesting, it gives an insider's look into the complex world of Florence and Europe in the Renaissance.  I learned many interesting things, particularly about the corruptrion in the Catholic Church at the time.  My only qualm is that the author seems to lose interest with after Part 3 ends.  The first 3 parts cover 100 years and last 260 pages and the last 140 years only take up 50 pages.  Also of note are the notes that give information about notable villas and works of art that are mentioned.  This would be extremely useful if one were to travel to Florence.  Overall, an excellent read that will enrich your understanding of the Past.	2002-12-15
US	42975321	R27JEKLOZN16MM	0767902890	852411699	The Things They Carried	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Excellent Surprise	I picked this book up not knowing anything about it.  Consequently, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The stories are all engaging and beautifully written.  The authors doesn't use a lot of description, but he still paints a vivid picture of the horror that was Vietnam.  The stories are revealing about what an ordinary soldier went through everyday.  Even a person who isn't intersted in Vietnam, Me, can enjoy and take something away from the book.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-07
US	42975321	RKI9DPNTGCC6X	0140442618	402567081	Timaeus and Critias (Penguin Classics)	Books	4	15	20	N	N	Truly a Classic	The Timaeus and the Critias are two dialogues written by Plato.  In the Timaeus he explores the origin of Earth by means of a dialogue between Socrates and Timaeus and in the Critias, also a dialogue, he writes about the myth of Atlantis.  I was suprised by how much he knew, such as that the Earth is a sphere, but also by the ignorance he had in saying that there were only 4 elements.  The writing for the most part is clear, but in some places hard to follow, an example is when Plato is discussing the creation of the soul of the World.  I had never read a book by Plato before and I am now interested in his other works.  Those who have never read ancient philosophy shouldn't be discouraged by this book, it is a rewarding read, and not hard to understand.	2002-10-27
US	42975321	R174I3D0G9CUMA	0345380371	546668910	Rising Sun	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Excellent Suspense-Somewhat Offensive	Michael Crichton knows how to write a good suspense novel.  His novels are different from other writers like Vince Flynn or Clive Cussler.  Michael Crichton researches the topic he is writing about and that makes reading about it much more enjoyable.  Rising Sun begins as a simple detective story, you'll think \\"Oh, more of the same catch the killer and the book's over.\\"  But that isn't the case in Rising Sun.  Crichton weaves insights about the Japanese people and their ways into the story, educating us as well as the protagonist, Peter Smith of the LAPD.  Multiple times I was reading and realized that I had no idea where the plot would turn next.  It was hard for me to stop reading, the chapters are usually short, so you'll think just one more and then I'll put it down.  But you keep reading.  Crichton manages to write a great story, but he drops some anti-Japanses propaganda into the novel.  Tom Clancy managed to write a novel, Debt of Honor, about Japan's business is war mentality and kept it clean.  Crichton's anti-Japanese leanings are the only bad part of the book.  This will be enjoyed by fans of his other works.	2002-10-04
