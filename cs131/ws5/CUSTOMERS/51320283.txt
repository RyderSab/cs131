A lot of the books on depression seemed to be too academic.  Or they focused on somebody else's depression.  This book really talked to me.  There are valuable suggestions, lots of practical advice, enough experimental data to make it sound like it might actually work for me, and no preaching.  I highly recomend it to anybody who is fighting depression or knows somebody who is.	2004-11-25

We read a lot of \\"chapter books\\" - Redwall, Madeleine L'Engle, C. S. Lewis, even the first few Harry Potter stories.  Our youngest is now 16, so I don't read to them anymore, but if I did this book would be in our stack.   <br /> <br />As a sci-fi fan, I liked the different magical races living alongside humans - satyrs, centaurs, dwarves, dryads, etc.  And I very much liked the coming of age theme.  The characters are given enough detail to interest the reader while not getting in the way of the story line.  There was a lot of action, with the different characters having to pull together to solve problems that lay in their way.  The length seemed just about right. <br /> <br />Some may feel there was too much in this first book - too many characters, too many crises, too many beings ready to help them along their way.  I would put this book in the pre-teen category - ages 9 to 12-ish.  Maybe, but I am still looking forward to seeing Peter Crowell's next book. <br />	2004-10-31

I enjoyed Kimball's \\"Building the Data Webhouse\\" and Mena's \\"Mining your web site\\", but this book takes a different perspective on the subject. Each of these books provide their own view on how the Internet had affected business intelligence.<br />There is a lot of detail in this book that would make it of interest to an implementer. It discusses many of the technologies used to build an Internet enabled application, such as XML, CWMI and Java. For example, in the section on Java, the author discusses the Java beans, the OLAP API and the data mining API. The book even provides some discussion on how you can use an application server in a business intelligence system.<br />I would definitely recommend this to any IT professional interested in the subject.	2002-10-03

I travel on business a lot - so I eat out a lot.  Since you are working during the day and you have to tend to email and return calls at night, eating out becomes your entertainment.  And since it is on the expense account, you deserve a good meal.  Maybe a great meal.  Now I know just exactly why, in spite of \\"watching what I eat\\", I was gaining so much weight.  When my doctor told me my cholesterol numbers, I figured I had better get serious about what I am eating.  And what I read in this book left me alternately laughing and crying.  Considering what I and my peers eat on a regular basis, it is a wonder more of us aren't just dropping dead in the steet.  Take my favorite \\"healthy\\" breakfast, the Belgian waffle (not those cholesterol laden eggs I wanted so much) - Of course with just a bit of butter and ham, not bacon - ONLY 1000 calories and more fat than the steak I had the night before, not to mention 2000 mg of sodium and cholesterol to literally die for.  And if we go out to lunch as a bunch, that new cheese fries with ranch dressing is a mere 3000 calories!  Yes, I shared it, but that means I only added 1000 calories and a full day's fat to the full meal I also ate.  BUT, the good news is that you can live in restaurants for weeks at a time, not shunning your friends and co-workers, not slinking off to have some carrot sticks and bottled water, not ordering just the steamed broccoli and a diet coke - you can eat well and fully and the secrets are in this book.  You'll see old cullinary friends in a new light - and maybe learn some new food ordering habits that could literally save your life.  I am strongly recommending this book to anyone who will listen.	2002-06-26

So why didn't I really, really like this book?  I think the story is just a little creepy.  Like being stuck in a backup on the highway and thinking that all those other people are sick for rubber-necking.  But then you get up to the scene and you find yourself looking, too.  And then, when you get past, realizing that you are one of those people rubber-necking.  I guess I'd rather that the story dives below the surface of the seemingly heartless actions of the main character and seems to ask us what we would do if we were there.  I don't always like what I see in that mirror.	2002-05-16

Not that I want to scare myself - I just want to hear about somebody that stops to think about the very mixed messages we often receive from &quot;experts&quot; and then goes on to explore the options.

Nietsche asks us not to read his books \\"like a looting soldiers,\\" choosing appealing passages at random from his aphorisms; instead, we are to read ourselves into \\"a passionate mood\\" in order to perceive the short rays of light that will lead us onward and upward.  Annie Proulx gives a the story of an outsider, somebody who is a little slow, a little off, a shy - whose world is less than great.  Way less than great.  She hints at his character in the first line of the book - \\"Quoyle: A coil of rope\\".   He will be used.  He falls into both opportunities and his own private hell.  I liked the style of the writing, the quirkiness of the characters, the strangeness of the setting, the magic of it all.  It reminds me of Vonnegut (Welcome To The Monkey House, Slaughterhouse Five, The Sirens Of Titan).  I hope you enjoy it also.	2002-03-27

The author seems to have started out with a premise I have held to since I read &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; when I was in college.  My first computer teacher, Ted Nelson, turned me on to the intrinsic beauty in things computerish with his enormously quirky &quot;Computer Revolution/Dream Machines&quot;.  My wife is a designer and I am in computers.  We have had many long conversations about the false division drawn between art and science.  So I thought I might have found a new soulmate when I picked up this little (176 pages) book.  Too bad it wasn't so.  Oh, Gelernter seems to be going the same way initially, even if I found the prose, and especially the examples, a little rough.  But he just couldn't hold me.  I found him spending too much time defending from his soapbox rather than illuminating.  He seemed to be trying to write the textbook for a college course he wants to teach instead of reaching out to the reader.  I don't think I could wholeheartedly recommend this book to my personal friends, so I can't recommend it to you either.  Maybe next time.	2002-03-12

This is one old-style hard-boiled crime novels with REALLY UGLY bad guys and an almost suprehero good guy - in this case a hard case Scottish journalist who has seen and done it all.  He practically trips over the throat slashing victim and considers the murder a \\"creative masterpiece\\".  Think Phillip Marlowe, but in black jeans.  Things get messier and messier.  Not quite a quick read (214 pages), but if you like this sort of thing when  feeding your own escapist tendencies, I think you'll join me in eagerly awaiting more from Chritopher Brookmyre.	2002-03-03

With that cover art, maybe it is a humorous treatment of missle treaties?  Turns out it is an excellent, if somewhat long (484 pages, illustrated) story of what one simple substance - NaCL - Sodium Chloride - good old table salt - has meant to mankind through several centuries.  I admit to being a sucker for a good science book - and this is just eactly that.  I would put Mark Kurlansky and this book in the same vein that Carl Sagan hooked me on Astronomy and James Burke's BBC series Connections could keep me spellbound with the intertwingling of it all.  You may have seen his previous book - \\"Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World\\".  If so, you know this author can take a somewhat commonplace object and weave a superior tale.  (Pun intended.)  Well this is essentially a short (cough) history of our race centered around salt.  Did you know that Ghandi started his rebellion over a salt tax?  Or that the slave trade was as dependent on the sale of salt as it was on rum and molasses?  But this is not just a history.  The author also lays out the health story on salt - both how it is used in the body as well as in the foods we eat. I recommend it to all my book-junky friends out there.	2002-02-25

It was perfect for a guy like Watson, except there weren't enough girls.  Yes, if you still think Nobel Laureates are all noble, this book will help break you of that impression.  You have to give the guy points for candidness.  I don't know anybody else who has put so many failed conquests into print.  And then the transition from lonely hunter to husband happens in the blink of an eye.  So don't blink.  The narrative sometimes reads like a Day Timer - you get the who, what, where.  Dry.  So, if you want to leave your scientists on a pedastal, leave this book on the shelf.  If you are intrigued with finding out what it was like back then, you could give this one a spin.	2002-02-25

I am a somewhat visual person.  When I was waiting on table during college I learned that &quot;people eat first with their eyes.&quot;  If something doesn't look right on the plate your tip will suffer.  I picked up my copy of &quot;The Amazing Adventures . . .&quot; at The San Francisco airport.  The cover art caught my eye from about 50 feet away.  I was intrigued - what kind of book looks for all the world like an aging comic book?  It brought me back to Saturday afternoons in my room with my collection of suprehero stories - especially The Metal Men.  And the collection secreted in the cupbord of the altarboy room that helped pass the few minutes before 6 AM mass - The Green Lantern, Superman, Batman.  At 636 pages, this is not a quick read.  At one level, this is a buddy-story.  Two cousins, one an under-schooled but gifted writer and the other a gifted academy-trained  artist - are thrown together and become a dynamic duo.  Then there are several themes and characters that weave in and out of the story line - a golem (!), Harry Houdini, magic, and especially escapes.  Joe Kavalier's dramatic escapes run through the book, but  everybody in this book seems to be trying to escape from something - some from situatiions, some from people, some from life.  Big issues - war, the nature of life, what constitutes art - are all intertwingled with the more mundane issues of evryday life - how to find a job, make a living, stay alive.  Longing, hope and love battle with fear, self-loathing and dark desires.  The charcters are real with real, everyday concerns.  Their motives as complex and conflicting as a body could have.  But, at the same time, their lives are larger than ours.  The story could easily have degenerated into a mass of raw emotion or gone all clinical and cold on us.  But the author has crafted a great story with believable charcters that held me in it's grip until the last page.  Now I am really looking forward to reading more of Michael Chabon's work.	2002-02-21

My wife gave me a copy for Valentine's Day last year and I have kept it on my desk ever since to remind me.  Read the other reviews if you have time to waste, but then buy this one.  When you get it, carefully read it yourself, THEN wrap it.  Then, when you give it, curl up with that special person and read it together.  This is less fattening than chocolates, lasts lots longer than roses, and is way cheaper than either.	2002-02-16

And I have found I tend to like the Newberry Award winners.  This is a very good book for young people who are ready to start wrestling with stories that pose ethical dilemas.  This is not a fairy tale, though, thank Ja, it is fiction.  We got a copy when our eldest daughter was graduating into chapter books.  Since then, each of our children has chosen to read this book on their own.  And, even better, talked with us about the issues it presents to them - issues of free will, responsibility, self sacrifice, choice, determinism.  It allowed us to discuss difficult, sometimes painful choices while holding them at arm's length as you can with fiction.  Still, it is a somewhat dark, disturbing tale.  Not in the almost prurient RL Stine (Stein?) Fear Street way.  More the way a brooding storm slowly, inexonerably moves up on you.  Younger readers may find it too dark.  But I think it is very much worth reading.	2002-02-16

Well, my parents had put the old B&W TV down there and I discovered Godzilla, The Blob, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Invasion Of The Body Snatcher, and War Of The Worlds.  Milo is a lot luckier.  He gets a car and a tollbooth.  And from there he starts on an amazing adventure full of starnge creatures, stranger people, and the strangest lands - all of which is wrapped in puns and just enough reality to make you wish you could go along.  We got this for our kids and it became an instant favorite for bedtime reading.  And I confess to having read ahead after lights out to see what came next.  This is suggested for ages 9 to 12.  Our youngest was totally engrossed in the story at 5, even if she didn't get all the puns.  So buy this book and find a young person to read it with, if you need an excuse.  You'll both love it.	2002-02-16

We used to have a vegetable graden.  We had several.  Each time  we'd start out with the best intentions.  Our kids would pick out about a hundred seed packets.  I would do the digging.  We would plant enough to feed a small island nation.  Then things would dissolve.  Nobody had time to water and weed and thin and very soon we had another lovely weed patch that I would mow over.  For the last couple of years my wife and I started buying folowring plants and putting them, helter skelter in a corner of the front yard.  As I watched the first real snow fall of the season  come down last week (finally!) I got to wondering what we were going to do with that corner this year.  A quick trip to a local book emporium to sample the wares led to discovering this absolute gem.  I had made do with Cocket's Vistory Garden and Square Foot Gardening for years.  So what made me buy this one?  Aside from straightforward prose, incredible photos, and well rendered advice - the section titled \\"Improvisong tools and equipment\\".  Finally, an author that understood that all those Martha Stewart-ish perfect tool lists just depressed me.  I don't have several acres of land and unlimited credit at Smith & Hawkens.  Get this:  \\"The biggest investment you may need to make is in a spade and a fork - try to buy second-hand if your budget is tight.\\"  She goes on to explain many uses for recyclable plastic containers in your garden and how to get cheap pots and potting soil.  If you want to create a beutiful natural garden without spending a fortune, make an investment in this book and get off to a great start.	2002-02-09

And three years more until I could read it again to her younger sister.  And two more years until I could read it again to our youngest.  And each of them spent their allowance money to own their own copy.  And went on to give it as a present to special freinds.  If you miss this one, it is your own fault.  This is one of my (our) all time favorite books.  A truly classic tale or good vs evil.  A story of immense courage somehow fitting within the frame of a young, near-sighted girl.  On my list, it is right up there with Stranger In A Strange Land - the book that made me a reader.  One caveat - the evil in this story is truly Evil and may be too intense for younger readers - maybe under 8.	2002-02-09

She struggles with her siblings (10 at one point) just to feed and cloth themselves.  Her mother dies when she is just 6 years old from blood clots.  Her step mother his on a continual slide towards total mental breakdown.  Their house is occupied in turn by American and French forces.

Okay - some of the dialect comes on a little too thick - especially at the begining - but I liked this story a lot.  This one helped get me through a &quot;weather delay&quot; at a great metropolitan airport, and then some.  The main character, Clayton, tells people to call him Titus and then starts predicting the future.  Not those great big tabloid future predictions, it is just that he seems to know the &quot;sort of stuff he's got no cause to know.&quot;  Like drawing an accurate map of Antartica on his chimney.  Then there is an unsolved disappearance of a child three years ago that Clayton/Titus seems to know something about.

Yes another really great Detective Superintendent Richard Jury story.  A bucket full of interesting  (read: quirky, but loveable) characters in a great setting (Stratford-on Avon) - only one of them has this nasty thing about using a razor in a most unconventional way - and then leaving a bit of poetry on the corpses as a signature.  And just to add a twist, a little boy who is related to two of the victims is missing.  I put Martha Grimes right up there with Christie for character and plot twists any day.

My wife is a costume designer and originally got this for herself, but I and my three daughters have each found good information on a variety of techniques, hardware and software.  It is consise and very well illustrated.  I highly recomend it.	2001-12-30

I may as well admit up front to being part Irish - and that I loved this book.  Who but an Irishman could start a story with the mother of seven children registering to get widow's benefits when her husband has very recently died - as in that afternoon.  At that point you either stop reading or you can't wait to see what happens next (as I couldn't wait.)  In the end I have to to say this book was way too short - which is one of the best compliments I can give an author.	2001-12-29

So what do you do after checking email?  Hoepfully you'll have something good to read with you - like this book.  My fiction reading leans toward mysteries, so it is not much of a stretch for me to find a de-bunking book interesting.  These are not really new pieces for the author - really a collection of previously published articles.  The magazine legnth and style means each is self-contained and easy to digest - perfect after a 10-hour day at a client.  What comes through is just how many whacky ideas are out there.  And how a bit of science and a small measure of logic combined with a questioning attitude can help keep you sane.  I don't watch daytime TV even when I am home during the day - but I doubt the author is considered a good bet for any of those shows that make their ratings based on the folks that believe that stuff.	2001-12-29

News flash - we've been doing it for 4000 years - or so says Sue Hubbell.  Don't worry that you are not a geneticist - each chapter of this well written book combines a personal narrative with history, a primer on genetics, and bits of the author's life in the Ozarks.  This book focuses on the ceturies old changes to a variety of organisms, including cats (hence the title).  As with other man made and artificial divisions (e.g. the sciences - Biology, Chemistry, etc.) species are a product of our human need to impose order on what appears to be a chaotic universe.  They are not an immutable laws of nature.  Read this book and at least you'll be able to add well-reasoned commentary when the subject comes up at the office.	2001-12-26

Well check this one out.  With a fresh view and a scientist's eye, Christine Finn gives us new insight into a subject that has been done before.  Frankly, I was sceptical, but I also had a minimum of six hours to wait at SFO (due to fog there and snow in Chicago).  The author covers the valley like nobody I have ever read.  Underlying a roaming set of essays is an almost palpable enthusiasm.  And there is a romantic slant (in the classic sense) - she sees the valley as what it is as well as what it means to society.  I recommend it.	2001-12-26

Kavalier is a young comic artist who escapes the badest bad guys (Nazi Germany) only to find himself in a new country out of contact with his family.  From the depths of powerlessness and doom comes the invention of his superhero.  Pen and brush couldn't destroy Hitler, but the artist can imagine characters who can.  Okay, this may not be on the same level as The Red Badge Of Courage.  But it is a great story and you'll love it.	2001-12-26

Now that I've got that over with, let me tell you that the laughter to tear ratio for this book is about 1 to 4.  Remember Grapes Of Wrath from High School?  This is much sadder in parts.  I always have at least one book with me when I travel and this one was the right size as well as being about the Irish.  (I am of Irish descent, so that alone is enough to interest me.)  I usually avoid the most popular books - I guess I'm not a joiner.  But when I saw this in paperback, I figured it was time.  This book goes a long way to enforce the misconception that every Irish mail is a potentially unemployed alcoholic.  And that they have such large families to make up for the fact that so many children die.  Sometimes it seemed they had children dropping like flies.  I was in a plane at 30,000 feet at abbout 11 PM reading about another child having died, with tears rolling down my face.  If you are looking for a good emotional catharsis, this might work for you.  It is certainly cheaper than an hour with a psychiatrist.	2001-12-20

I really like these art history mysteries of his. They always have some quirky characters, interesting settings, and very little bloodshed.  So I get my armchair travel nicely wrapped in a whodoneit.  But I especially like to learn something along the way.  Each of these show me something of an art world I will never live in - so I get a double-dip of tourism.  This story, set in both Italy and England also throws in a little of Miss Marple's small village life as well.  An easy read, not too long - I strongly recommend it.	2001-12-19

I must have reread it five or six times just for the pleasure of rolling Irvings prose around in my mouth.  Since then my life has gotten very full - my To Read list is very long and more often populated by business tomes than pleasure reading.  I did get to see the movie and loved it, but never got around to the book.  Then a business associate and friend told me that the book was ten times better than the movie.  He said I had to read it and even offered to give me his copy.  So I finally read it and I am here to tell you that this is one powerful novel.  I think the characters and their lives are wonderfully portrayed.  I took it on a business trip and it may have been the first time I didn't mind the flight being delayed as I could plow through another 50 pages.  Oh, yes, it is a bit long (587 pages), but I never once found myself wishing it would go faster.  This one is definitely on my personal best list.	2001-12-19

As we worked through the process of designing our internal scorecard I found this slim volume (&lt;200 pages) an invaluable aid.  From the introduction through to the last chapter, I found this book full of practical ideas and advice.  For instance, one of my personal pet peeves is the short shrift most larger companies give to the value of their people.  In chapter 10: &quot;Measuring Employee Satisfaction&quot;, Mr. Brown addresses topics such as the short-sightedness of improving profits through downsizing and how a balanced scorecard can help underline this mistake.  He ends the book with a practical 10 item list &quot;The Key To Successful Plans&quot;.  After all the theory, I was glad to have a roadmap handy.  I'd recommend this book to anybody who is contemplating a new scorecard, or rehabbing an existing one.	2001-12-19

This slim volume (only 120 pages, including the notes) goes a long way towards illuminating the importance of &quot;intangible&quot; items such as intellectual capital, research and development, brand names, etc., are to the economic growth and wealth of our society.  As the preface to chapter one, Blair and Wallman quote Attorney Lloyd Cutler (commenting on the proposed breakup of Microsoft), &quot;Given that no company can establish a monopoly on brains, how do you keep the people that make it work?  There are no tangible assets to divest.  There is intellectual property and that's about it - and a building.&quot;  Exactly!  As the events of September 11th so horrily illustrated, you could burn the plant to the ground, but as long as you have a repository of your critical business information, you can resume business anywhere.  How we view and deal with our intangible assets may be the one thing that determines whether a company survives or not.  I think all managers everywhere should read this book.	2001-12-19

Christmas.  Since then I have sampled widely.  I quite liked John McDonald with his color mysteries - until I got to my fifth or sixth book and realized that ten pages into the story I knew exactly what would happen.  I never had that problem with this book.<br />The story is set in a fascinating period - 1663 - and in an exciting setting - Oxford, England, during the Restoration.  The plot revolves around the death of Dr. Grove, who is found dead by poisioning in his Oxford room.  So far, so good.  But the story is told from four different viewpoints by four very different characters.  And none of them is exactly who or what they initially lead you, dear fellow reader to believe.  Is the the Italian physician really so incredibly naive?  The son of a traitor, the mathematician and cryptographer, Oxford antiquarian - each tells the same story, but each through their own very human view.  And the title?  I won't spoil the story if I say it is very apt.  I have gone on from this book to read Iain Pears other works and become a real fan.	2001-12-19

He is rude, crude, at times lewd, always a dude.  His New York digs could get a little claustophobic to me, so I was glad to see him head out to his family's home and kids' summer camp - Echo Hill Ranch.  As usual, whatever he turns his hand to somehow evolves into grand highjinks, but everything works out in the end.  This time he get's drawn into the suspiscious deaths of 4 little old ladies.  No pony for Kinky - he rides the range in Dusty, his late mom's talking Chrysler looking for clues and trying not to join the old ladies on the other side of the rainbow.  Needless to say, Justice (and Kinky) triumphs, but not before his usual stirring of the hornets nest investigative style makes him equal numbers of friends and enemies.  Oh, go ahead and read it - you know you want to!	2001-12-19

You either love him or leave him.  Nobody waffles when it comes to Kinky.  While this may not be the tightest plot line - hey, you don't get Shakespeare from this guy.  Closer to Madd Magazine, eh?  Bawdy - yes.  Clever - in parts.  witty - I'd say mostly.    But I really read it to get my hit of really rude analogies and metaphors - none of which I will quote here for fear that young persons may be reading this.  Kinky's friend McGovern dissapears into the Pacific Ocean - highjinx ensue.  After you read it, give it to somebody with a dry sense of humor.	2001-12-19

Or buy it for a special friend.  O'Toole explores the connection to Faith for some names you will recognise.  Yes, there are still heroes and they will not be drawn in by the dark forces that assail those who strive for greatness.  O'Toole's combination of Christionaity and journalism makes for a very readable narative.  I heartily recommend it.	2001-12-19

Tai Chi sounded like just the ticket, but because I travel I don't have time for a class.

But, if you want to successfully implement an enterprise-level, mission-critical data warehouse, this is one book you will definitely want to have.   &quot;Object-Oriented Data Warehouse Design: Building A Star Schema&quot;  presented me with a new look at the whole Business Intelligence field.  I  am not even half way through and I can already see why some past projects  ran into trouble and how I can avoid similar problems in the future.<br />And  this is not one of those unreadable academic tomes that you put on your  bookshelf to impress your boss.  I have to agree with Bill Inmon's foreword  that Giovinazzo  &quot;strikes a fine balance between theory and  practicality.  Theories are explained in the cloth of practicality.  Rules  of thumb and practical realities always have a touch of theory to explain  the underlying philosophy.&quot;  This is a very readable book with lots of  immediately useful information without resorting to that  &quot;cookbook&quot; approach.  I especially enjoyed the discussion in  Chapter 4, The Implementation Model, on multiple dimensions and translating  them into a star schema.  The whole object oriented approach to star schema  design seems so logical, now that I have had it explained in such a clear,  concise manner.<br />BTW, the other book I wouldn't be without is Ralph  Kimball's &quot;The Data Warehouse Toolkit&quot;.  But if you can only get  one, get this one.  (And if you manage a DW, I'd seriously consider  investing in a copy for every person on the project.  I think you'll be  glad you did.)	2000-03-05

If you are an EG fan, or a mystery fan, be forewarned - you may lose sleep, ignore your personal wellbeing and that of your family once you  start this book.  It begins with Lynley and Havers completely at odds with  each other and takes you on a 594 page rollercoaster ride which includes  two murders, two suicides, a spin through S&amp;M-land, and more.
