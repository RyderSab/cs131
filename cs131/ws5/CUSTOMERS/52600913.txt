US	52600913	R1TES2EY661H49	0446364193	597792275	Along Came A Spider	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Plot not as airtight as Scott Turow.	This is a competent thriller: I stayed up to learn more even when I should have turned my lamp off and gone to sleep. I particularly commend Patterson for his ability to write believably from the point of view of someone from a different race.  It sounded realistic to me; however I'm not African-American & I'd like to know how it sounds to someone who is.<br /><br />Patterson succeeds in creating \\"life on the page.\\" The writing quality is not consistent. Cliches, redundancies and irrelevant descriptions disappointed me at times.<br /><br />I'll try to avoid writing a Spoiler Review, but a *very* illogical event was that someone who didn't murder receives the death penalty.	2005-07-12

Everyone has noticed the problem: Romanized transliteration is confusing. Someone else made the excellent recommendation: learn the alef-bet (and the pointing system) and use a real dictionary.<br /><br />Now that I am more familiar with written Hebrew, this dictionary has become more utile. It provides excellent instructions on pronunciation of Hebrew words. It is also handy for identifying a word that I have only heard spoken: I can just look up the transliterated word to find the meaning and the correct alef-bet spelling.	2004-12-27

Before this I took the Pimsleur Polish course with great results.<br /><br />I went to Hebrew school for a few years as a child and can read phonetically, but I have never really learned conversational Hebrew.  The lessons are effective in teaching basic phrasing and composing sentences.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this enjoyable, effective course.  Furthermore, I don't know of any other good Hebrew audio-course.	2004-10-18

Hysterical mob-rule, manipulated by demagoguery, cruelty and opportunism destroyed many lives during the Cultural Revolution.

This fiction is like looking out a window at a Las Vegas water show under colored lights: riotious, gorgeous and original. Everything by this Galician Polish Jewish writer/artist is genius.<br />The title story \\"The Sanitorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass\\" deals with Schulz's fantastic visit to his deceased father in the afterworld.<br />In Polish the title literally reads \\"the Sanitorium beneath the hourglass.\\"  However, the term Hourglass (klepsydra) is also used for death notices that are posted on bulletin-boards in public squares.  Hence the allusion to a death notice in the title.	2003-08-18

I have also studied Spanish &amp; German with Berlitz tapes, and this is as good as the Berlitz &quot;Think &amp; Talk&quot; tape program,(except that the latter does not cover Polish.)<br /><br />My only regret is that the course could not continue into more advanced language studies.<br />Definitely worth the money and time.	2003-08-07

I have been studying the world of rugs and carpets for 2 years.  Reading about the tradition and place of rugs & rugweaving in the Islamic world goes a very long way to explain who Muslims are.<br />I never found an equivalent artform in the Jewish world--until I discovered this book.<br />The author describes the attributes and history of those rugs known to have been made by Jews & containing in-woven Jewish iconography. He delves into the Israeli Arts & Crafts movement, whose apotheosis was Boris Schatz and the Bezalel (pronounced beit-TSA-lel)factory-school of crafts.<br />I cannot overemphasize how fascinating the Anton Felton's book is.  I have just ordered one of the carpets that he describes in his book--from an EBay dealer.<br />I have 2 copies of the book--one from Amazon, the other from the Textile museum of Toronto.	2002-07-25

An excellently detailed biography drawing heavily and honestly from the biography by Teresa Chylinska .  Compared to the biography by Maciejewski, the current opus lacks \\"life.\\"  I am not a musician, so I can't comment on all the remarks and details discussed and illustrated with excerpts from the composer's sheet music.<br />\\"<br />I object to the statement that Szymanowski \\"was strictly speaking a bisexual,\\" which the biographer bases on the fact that he had strong friendships with several women.  Other books I have read refer more directly to the composer's sexual orientation.<br /><br />The book would be more believable if Szymanowski's homosexuality had been discussed openly.<br /><br />Good number of photographs are included.	2002-06-20

A youth's discovery of stage magic, combined his Scots-Ontario upbringing of prudery, hypocrisy and prejudice make for a fascinating life-path. The characters are internally consistent and sharply defined.  These eccentrics cannot abide each others' quirks. As the expression goes, &quot;Something's gotta give,&quot; and that something is disclosed from the beginning.<br />Like a fine Persian rug, it is complex and well executed. *Everything* ties in to a perfect ending, just at the right time.	2002-06-20

The life of the protagonist--whom we previously knew just an appendage to his father's colossal persona in Fifth Business--is analyzed.  The story has many sockets within sockets and abundant psychological theory.  Robertson Davies is so artful sn author that the information on archetypes never feels as though it came out of an encyclopedia.  Rather, it is essential to the character's trajectory.  Highly recommended.  Makes me proud to be a Canadian!	2002-06-20

I had the strange luck to read it during my internship at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, which is where scenes of Joshua's infirm wife took place. Richler easily gets me to belly-laugh. BUT, part of his humor is based on homophobia. Joshua is mistaken for gay and his mother enthusiastically and misguidely marches with PFLAG. I think such humour is of the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; variety. In this as in other books of his, Richler relies on gay people, or misidentified straight people for a cheap laugh, which I don't appreciate.The rest of the book is great and I recommend it.	2001-09-20

Duddy Kravitz grew up on the wrong side of town to most Montrealers. His neighbourhood was poor, but not abject. It had a marvellous immigrant-village life that the writer transmits to us. &quot;The Apprenticeship...&quot; is hilarious and painfully honest as it portrays the 1940s Montreal Jewish community. You will meet them, warts and all. I first read this as a sensitive teen and I was appalled by what a flawed person Duddy finally grew into. The author is a master of dialect and lucid description. His subsequent books have also been funny, but formulaic. Duddy Kravitz is the apotheosis of Mordecai Richler's talent.	2001-09-20

I couldn't put it down! Cynthia Ozick crafts a great story with the remains of enigmatic Polish Jewish writer/artist Bruno Schulz. She fulfilled my wishes, by adding modern substance to the life of this fragile, ephemeral visionary. Ms. Ozick creates a fictional path, using landmarks from Schulz's life.  I was interested to see how the WW2's aftermath redounds upon Sweden (I naïvely say,&quot;of all places.&quot;)<br />Our view of Bruno Schulz &amp; so many other creative artists--our very patrimony--remains blocked by the ramifications of the Nazi Holocaust. This novel provides a glimpse of that as well as intrigue, Stockholm newspaper office politics, orphancy,deception &amp; Ozick's eidetic extrapolation of Schulz's lost Messiah. I recommend it!	2001-08-18

Take &quot;Dance.&quot;  Here you will find a list of many different kinds and styles of dance (square dance, line dance, pas de deux, pas de trois, merengue, tango, etc.)  Thus, you get way more than you do with a thesaurus that simply provides synonyms for words that you must originate.  From what I read in the introduction, the editor Stephen Glazier had kept these word lists for his own writing.  Now, we can all write with his vocabulary lists, however they have been contributed by experts in the respective subject areas.<br />Occasionally, I have found a gap or missing word, e.g. I tried to find a synonym for the verb to flourish (as in brandish) but could only find the noun flourish as in a rhetoric device.<br />Still, this is one of the best references I have seen for writers!	2001-07-01

I am a Board Certified Allergist/Immunologist and I bought the book to help me to solidify my knowledge of basic immunology.<br />Since the American Board of Allergy and Immunology only issues 10-year certification --and I  took the exam the first time in 1991 -- I have to take a multiple choice  recert exam soon.  The book is helping me prepare by reviewing current  basic Immunology in a very easy to understand (and therefore easy to  REMEMBER) fashion.<br />The prose is not prosaic, it's fun!  The writing  describes the immune system's structure and functioning clearly and  logically.  It does an excellent job of tying everything together, which  can be difficult with the expanding &quot;octopus&quot; of detail that  comprises modern immunology.<br />I highly recommend this for physicians and  students of medicine or immunology.	2000-05-29
