Second the book is not truly an encyclopedia as no subject is covered in-depth.  You get a bunch of staccato blurbs on the different topics.  I expected much deeper coverage of clockwork androids, however all I got was a single 5 sentence paragraph.  Britannica this is not. <br /> <br />Consider this a primer for younger children.	2005-06-12

The book begins with a discussion of bookplate history, including the artist, techniques, and why of bookplates. <br />This section also gives an overview timeline of bookplate art and collecting. <br /> <br />The second portion of the book contains images and brief, sometimes shallow, descriptions of the plate, the owner, or the artist.   <br /> <br />My rating is based in my love of all things book, and the wonderful visual catalog of bookplates that make up the majority of the book. Because of the occasionally prosaic descriptions and compressed information regarding collecting and creation techniques I give this work only 4 stars.	2005-03-16

The basic layout of a Coat of Arms is discussed, including a very brief history, along with the rules of placement and description for the major elements. The author also includes some discussion of the prevailing Heraldry of countries around the world, including medieval countries.  The appendixes include elements for the user to trace or imitate when creating their own Coat of Arms. Lastly there is some contact information for organizations involved with Heraldry. <br /> <br />The book lacks depth.  It provides nothing resembling an exhaustive list of elements; only a few basic forms and styles are covered. Further there is nil discussion concerning the meaning of the elements presented.  The most a reader can learn is that crowns and lions rampant are symbols of Royalty, and some of that we have to infer. The work feels directed to early middle school children and should probably be marked as Young Reader.	2005-03-16

Although purporting to cover issues regarding society's relationship to technology, the authors present a short and poorly reasoned discussion of media violence, followed up with much fluff regarding gene therapy and genetic manipulation. <br /> <br />I agree that violence in the media has a detrimental effect on society, however, I cannot stomach the idea that \\"the nihilistic music of a German rock band\\" contributed to the Littleton Colorado school shootings.  Such tripe derails any rational discussion of the subject. <br /> <br />Regardless of the out of date information regarding genetic science, the heart of the book adds nothing to the premise. Had the authors actually spent time developing the idea of the \\"Technologically Intoxicated Zone\\" instead of presenting the ideas of religious scholars regarding gene therapy, the book may have had some value. <br /> <br />The original promise of the book is left entirely unfulfilled and the reader is left to fend for themselves regarding their own relationship, and that of their community, to technology.  <br /> <br />I feel that the title is deceptive and the irrelevant arguments presented are disjointed.	2004-11-16

Invest your money and only spend from what those investments earn you. <br /> <br />Now on to what the book lacks: <br /> <br />1. Concrete lessons about investing and money management. <br />2. Numbers to demonstrate how the secret above works. <br />3. Coherent story telling and editing. <br /> <br />The first is derived from the book's primary function which is to entice the reader to purchase more books and materials from the same system, in hopes of finding employable strategies to make money.  This book is foremost a money making proposition, and secondly a commercial.  The second deficiency is surprising in a book written by a CPA.  However, I refer you to the first deficiency.  Lastly, this failing likely comes from the fact the book was written by a CPA.  Many people would feel that this lends some sort of credibility to the work, and my guess is that this was the intent.  I base my assumption on the fact that in  Robert's own words, he recommends hiring the best people for any given job.  Anyone should be able to tell you that a CPA is not \\"the best\\" writer for the job. <br /> <br />My suggestion is to invest your twelve dollars and at most check this book out at the library.	2004-09-08

The editing style, however, clipped my rising expectations. Like a chicken scratching in the dirt, new ideas would be tossed into the middle of an existing chain of thought. Occasionally ideas would end as fledglings, never fully explored or even transitioned.<br />That said, I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a solid introduction to marketing a webiste or product on the internet. I learned how keyword analysis works, how to create a marketing campaign, how to monitor a campaign, and how to get more money from a campaign.<br />Although no topic was covered in depth, the resource section at the end of the book points the reader to industry recognized sources.  The book even includes advertising credit with Overture and FindWhat, a great way to get your feet wet.<br />If you do not mind some leaps, and a little silliness, this book may be a four on your list.

However, in the attempt to cover both aspects of a broad topic the book fails to cover either aspect in depth.<br />You do get color pictures of many tools and hardware products, although the focus is on tools and products used for home repair or remodeling.  Additionally nearly all of the skills covered focus on home repair and remodeling.<br />I find that other books from Reader's digest give better coverage of home repair and remodeling. Although possibly useful for a novice, I find that the tool coverage is neither interesting nor exhaustive. The split personality and homeowner focus leaves this book with an average rating.	2004-04-20

I had hope.  The second book had some potential.  This book dashed those hopes, and squandered that potential.  The characters are entirely too transparent. If I have to hear one more time how kenders never feel fear, but in that instance Tasselhoff felt something that equates to fear, I swear I'm going to scream.  Raistlin is so ambitious for power that he has to constantly remind everyone, including the reader, of this, and oh yeah, by the way, he's Fistandantilus. What?  Could that have come from any farther out in left field?<br />This series is a poor example of Fantasy writing.  The only reason that this book rates two stars is that it may serve as a whirlwind introduction to the world of Dragonlance.  However, a book of short stories could have served that purpose better.<br />All in all a disappointment.	2003-04-24

The game mechanics were not in your face. I do not recall reading how Raistlin was forced to rest after casting a spell, or too often about the &quot;language of magic&quot;.  I also enjoyed the Bardic renditions, to a degree.<br />There were still too many subplots, and the adventure overall is too grandiose.  There were some cases where the plot was paper-thin. I would have preferred subtler foreshadowing, especially with a trilogy in which to unfold the story. If the authors have to tell me what's coming or how the characters feel, I don't feel that they have done their job.<br />The best of a mediocre series.	2003-04-24

I nearly stopped reading this book, and I'm still debating returning it to the used bookstore, along with the rest of the series.<br />The plot is disjointed, which is explained in the after word.<BR>The authors modified the plot based on gaming sessions that they had during the project.  Although the scenes derived from those sessions are memorable and humorous their integration causes the greatest holes in the story line.<br />I occasionally felt that I was being slapped in the face with game mechanics.  This is bad enough during a role-playing session, and I find it unacceptable in a novel.<br />The ending in addition to the books role as a successful hook into the rest of the series is what spares this book a single star.	2003-03-04

I did not realize that it was the second installment in a quintet, until I finished reading it.

As I said in my review of the first book, this book is a shining example of the high fantasy genre, on par with, if not surpassing Tolkien.<br />Combining lively, likable characters, a grand and tangled plot, and a vivid world this book is superb.	2003-01-06

After that read I set out to find the complete series in Hardcover.  <br />This first book in the series introduces all of the characters and sets the stage for a conflict that spans another three novels.  The author weaves the story line into plausible embodiments of the quotes from great literature that follow many of the chapters. Although this work is high fantasy in the tradition of Tolkien I find Duncan's work easier to read.  Further, Duncan posses a unique voice and an imaginative view of magic which distinguish him from other writers who merely rehash hackneyed plots.<br />A very enjoyable read that more than fulfills its role in inspiring the reader to find out how the whole epic ends.	2003-01-03

I find many of the creative attempts of the mainstream Christian culture very bland.  I feel that we have lost many of the traditions of great writers like C.S. Lewis and artist working in a myriad of other genres.  However, aside from communicating his premise and a few morsels of truth this book falls on its face.  I was left to puzzle out specific examples of mediocre art, no specific examples were given.  Further the author also jumps into tirades about abortion.  Abortion is wrong, but what does that have to do with the arts?<br />I wish that the author had some training in classical argument, or had hired a ghostwriter to present his arguments.  If he had I might not be left with the irony that his book is mediocre.	2003-01-03
