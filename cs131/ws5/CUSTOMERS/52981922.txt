I guess it was just curiousity in the end, and we all know what that did to the cat...<br />Taking up a little after the point where FRAGMENTS left off, SHIP OF THE DAMN follows the same group of characters in another bizarre, out-of-this world adventure.  Once again, all of the characters are something less than one-dimensional and only the villians seem to have any real depth (and that ain't saying a whole lot either).  The plot, which tries to pass off as a possible alternative to the Philadelphia Experiment, runs pretty bland with random spurts of action that always seem to finish just as they get interesting.  And, yet again, the author's writing style is like the Hardy Boys meets Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS: a mix of junior high school dialgue mixed (unsuccessfully) with gritty violence.  In fact, it was so amateurish that I stopped mid-way through the book, leaving to collect dust until I find someone to purchase my slightly used copy.	2003-01-30

Sure, James Herbert has a tendency to repeat himself a couple times throughout the book (and still has me wonder how much of his story is based on fact!), but his style and character development skills are above anything recent by Koontz (or King, for that matter!).  OTHERS takes it's time to lure you into the world of a gum-shoe detective before exploding into the horror novel you'd expect, delicately increasing the suspense with each chapter.  James Herbert has succeeded in creating a world filled with the grotesque, misfortunate and mysterious in his latest, OTHERS.  He also managed to give birth to one of the most interesting protagonists: Nick Dismas, a deformed PI and reincarnation of an evil Hollywood star.  I'm just sorry we had to see him put to rest so soon!	2001-11-11

I'm am left somewhere between disappointed and confused by Nicholas Evans' latest, THE SMOKE JUMPER.  The far-from-original love triangle between two best friends and one girlfriend actually held some promise for the first half of the novel.  This was a nearly complete story filled with enough Montana imagery, longing romance and quick-draw dialogue that I've come to expect from the author.  Even the predictible tragedy managed to hold my attention.  That is, until the novel went south -- almost literally.  I struggled with the second half of this book as the story transports the main characters to far off places, each on their own personal journey to better the world.  It was suddenly THE SMOKE JUMPER OUT OF AFRICA.  I nearly had to turn back to the cover to make sure I was reading the same novel.  All in all, though, THE SMOKE JUMPER managed to keep my interest to some degree and still warrant a decent review -- if only because of the first 150 pages.	2001-10-30

But, come on guys, didn't I read the same story in THUNDERHEAD and RIPTIDE?  The only originality to this latest installment in techo-thrillers is the cliff-hanger ending (sorry if that gives anything away, folks).  In fact, I'm certain that I've never looked more forward to a sequel because I feel THE ICE LIMIT was only the tip of the iceberg (bad joke).  <br />All in all, though, THE ICE LIMIT is a fun read and filled with everything that makes this sort of novel so much fun.  It's total escape-ism with a twist ending at it's best -- and who isn't looking for that these days?	2001-10-10

Okay, so maybe my title for this review isn't all that interesting and original, but (and trust me on this one) CALIFORNIA FIRE &amp; LIFE is.  Jack Wade, a down-on-his-luck fire insurance investigator, becomes the novel's unlikely hero in this technically-filled thriller (think Crichton meets Ellroy) that combines the science of fire and arson with a slick writing style that often felt like was being read aloud to me.  Never was I let down by any of the surprises, flashbacks or characters while reading CA FIRE &amp; LIFE and found myself nearly begging for more.  The dialogue was quick and often very witty.  The depth of deceit was very believable and never confusing (despite what other reviewers may say).  Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this book.  Just read it.  In CALIFORNIA FIRE &amp; LIFE, Don Winslow has proven himself a great mystery writer.  <br />Now, how about bringing Jack back?	2001-08-09

What started out as a very intriguing plot (man discovers long-lost girlfriend has committed suicide and learns of her dark past but still claims to see her, believing that she isn't dead yet) ends in a ball of silly confusion and rather too quickly.  I'm not for one to really dwell on the negative, but it's difficult not to when you expect something more from a talented author.  Douglas Clegg has created in &quot;NAOMI&quot; a handful of charaters that are truly hard to appreciate: Maddy is completely unbelievable; Jake is often too sweet and sincere for his own good; Laury often speaks like an adult rather than the child she is.  Only Romeo and Naomi (who only really lasts for the first few pages) seemed to have more than one dimension.  Unfortunetely, neither get the story-line they really deserve.  Then there's the interwoven plot of 18th century witches that seems to pick up so suddenly that the reader doesn't get much time to digest the first few chapters of the novel that revolve around Naomi, Jake and their lives apart following an intense love for one another (a subject often repeated in Clegg's stories).  Despite all of this, I did find &quot;NAOMI&quot; a fast read due to the short chapters and not a complete waste of time.  The witch-massacre storyline was incredibly vivid as well as the world beneath the NY subway lines, both working very well together as two entirely different backdrops.  And I also enjoyed the the hunt for ancient witch graves and artifacts underneath Maddy's home -- just not her as a character.  All in all, &quot;NAOMI&quot; may not be up to par with Clegg's other novels (granted, this one was written online, a few chapeters a week), but it's a decent summer-time, red-eye flight type of book.	2001-07-27

In truth, I had picked up \\"AHWOSG\\" a couple times before while cruising through many a bookstore, only to set it back down because I found myself intimidated by it's title.  Besides, I'd already had my fill of Douglas Coupland novels and wasn't really sure there was much more to learn about my generation.  Thank you, Dave Eggers, for enlightening me and proving that I was wrong (once again!).  <br />While \\"AHWOSG\\" tends to vear towards gratuitous run-on paragraphs (some lasting more than a page), it's often very funny and easily to relate to.  Well, maybe not all that easy to relate to.  I mean, I haven't raised a little brother (not that I have one to raise), I haven't started a magazine from the ground up (nor have I ever worked for one that's already thriving) and I have yet to live in San Francisco.  But I often have felt many of the emotions and thoughts Dave Eggers writes about in loosing both parents, not having any REAL direction for his life (aside from wanting to do something important!) and continously struggling with his fears of rejection while wanting to attract as much attention as possible.  But where do we go from there?  Like any good biography, \\"AHWOSG\\" leaves me for wanting more, especially considering the age of it's author....	2001-07-23

Ted Gup's writing is enthralling and very real as he delves into the lives of a handful of CIA operatives and the classified missions that ultimately led to their deaths.  I was most amazed to find out that these operatives are far from the James Bond characters I had imagined!  I truly recommend this book as it explains two sides to each story: one from a human-interest point of view, with many in-depth interviews of surviving friends and family members, while also explaining the secrecy of cover-ups by the CIA.  Definitely NOT for the conspiracy-theory types out there!	2001-07-02

His dialogue is almost Garrison Keillor funny; his backdrops seemed to be painted by Norman Rockwell.  It's no wonder to me why most reviewers disliked his latest novel so much.  After all, in a world filled with Grisham wannabes, a reader is often taken back by an author that can truly write.<br />&quot;BOY IN THE WATER&quot; is another fine example of a talented novelist that not only can create a mystery but also deliver well-crafted prose -- two things that normally don't go hand in hand in suspense thrillers.  Much like his earlier novel &quot;CHURCH OF DEAD GIRLS,&quot; Dobyns builds a story around the small-town life (this time at a failing school for troubled children) and picks apart some of the things that make people tick.  The characters are, once again, well-crafted and nearly each is given a fair-amount of time in development.  However, &quot;BOY IN THE WATER&quot; is not without a couple flaws (repeat scenerios, stilted dialogue and B-movie quality situations), but no more than any other suspense novel out on the shelves today.  In fact, because the writing is so stylized, I found them easy to overlook.	2001-05-24

Nevertheless, I was glad to have the return of Tim Underhill and Tom Passmore (quite possibly the best amatuer detective duo of our time).  Much like Hitchcock, Straub's raw talent for creating elaborate thrillers with completely plausible twist endings is incredible.  What seperates the author, however, is his meandering prose which is filled with enough detail to possibly fill another novel.  I sometimes found myself a little bored with a few of the chapters (more specifically, the excerpts from a fictional Vietnam War novel about Franklin Bachelor) but ultimately enjoyed the story as a whole.  My only major disappointment is knowing that &quot;THE THROAT&quot; marks the end of a good series.	2001-04-02

The chapters areshort (very common for the author), making the novel an easy and fastread.  However, I also felt like there could have been more to thisstory that wasn't explored (i.e. why was the FBI mixed up in theexperiments? or what was Frannie's life with her first husband like?or what other investigations was Kit involved with prior to the&quot;Flight School&quot; that turned him into such a failure?).

I won't dare to try and summerize the story-line in my review because I doubt I could do much justice for it.  What I will say is that I find Douglas Clegg refreshing after almost giving up hope that there weren't many talented horror novelists left.  Clegg has a nack for weaving believable plot lines such as romance, family disputes, and jealousy into a suspense/horror genre.  And he takes his time doing so, giving the reader time to actually care about his characters, both good and evil.  Check out &quot;PURITY&quot; and you'll know what I mean.	2001-02-27

Despite following the same formula that seems to have worked in his previous Detective Cross novels, Patterson has managed to establish himself nicely among the ranks of Grisham, Deaver and Harris.<br />In &quot;JACK &amp; JILL,&quot; Alex Cross faces two mysteries (again).  Cross is torn, though (again).  Does he continue to work on the slayings of murdered school children close to his home or does he help solve what might be an assassination attempt on the President?  And Alex Cross also falls in love (again).  This time around, however, the detective discovers not just two serial killers but three, as one of the serial killings is being committed by a team.  And he doesn't necessarily get the girl, either.  In a nice change of pace, Alex Cross is tossed into the world of politics, the CIA and assassins-for-hire reminiscent of Clancy but without the techno-babble.  After much disappointment in &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK,&quot; I was thrilled to return to the world of Alex Cross and also pleasently surprised by the return of Soneji!	2001-02-15

I refuse to believe that &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; was written by the same guy responsible for creating the Alex Cross novels!  Maybe it's that my expecatations are higher for James Patterson -- he is, after all, one of the better American mystery novelists alive.  Or maybe it's because I couldn't have cared any less for the characters in &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; -- they were about as three dimensional as a piece of paper.  Or maybe it's because I felt like this novel was riding on the coattails of the OJ trial.  Maybe it's all the above.<br />Had &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; been written by any other author, I may not have been so brutal in my review.  But I have a feeling that this story had been tucked aside before Patterson became the suspense novelist we all now know, only to be published as a &quot;filler&quot; between Alex Cross novels.  The plot, which revolves around a famous singer/songwriter that has been put to trial for the murder of her latest husband (making this her second or third homicide, depending on who you ask), runs pretty thin at times.  Even the scenes with Barbara Streisand and Harry Conick were rediculous.  At times I felt like I was reading the novel through frosted lenses because the heroine was painted as such a celebrity angel.  And I won't even get started on the dialogue.<br />Whatever the case may be, I ask James Patterson never to stop writing about Alex Cross.  It's what he does best.	2001-02-07

Don't get me wrong, both &quot;ALONG CAME A SPIDER&quot; and &quot;KISS THE GIRLS&quot; are very enjoyable reads, not to mention fast and easy.  However, I did find trouble with Patterson's too-good-to-be-true (or evil) characters, forced and scripted dialogue, and enough similar scenes in both novels to make me question if the author knows he's repeating himself (i.e. Alex Cross falling for the female lead, two nasty villians, victims being kept underground).  <br />At least I can say that &quot;KISS THE GIRLS&quot; was a much better novel than it was a film, despite how much I enjoy Naomi Judd and Morgan Freeman.  And I'll look forward to the next Alex Cross novel as I find James Patterson's writing addictive while being a light read.	2001-01-30

Although &quot;Over the Edge&quot; is a bit talky at times, Jonathan Kellerman's third Alex Delaware novel finally places the author as a major contender in the thriller genre.   This tightly written story, about a former child-patient of Dr. Delaware's that supposedly grows up to become a schizophernic serial-killer, reads much like a Q &amp; A session: the reader follows Alex Delaware on numerous &quot;interviews&quot; as he attempts to gather information to establish his former-patient's mental stablity.  At times the novel gets a little too technical in all of it's psychological terminology, but makes up for it with strong character development and an amazing ending.

Like his previous &quot;winners,&quot; Jackson has hand picked LuAnn because of her situation, making his offer more difficult to refuse, but her acceptance comes with a heavy price: LuAnn is Jackson's pawn and must agree to do as Jackson commands, including never to return to the US upon winning and living in utter fear.<br />Jackson, while a very interesting foe, is just too much to believe: He's a mastermind in chemistry and poisons, a regular Boris Karloff of disguse, and more stealthy than a ninja warrior.  LuAnn Tyler is almost as unreal as she turns from uneducated single mom to killer millionaire in the span of ten years.  At least she manages to keep her sense of humor and brash attitude throughout the story.  Toss in a former FBI agent (now living under the witness protection program) as LuAnn's love interest and a former boxing pro turned bodyguard as the &quot;uncle&quot; to both LuAnn and her daughter and you have the makings of a very well-rounded cast.  However, the novel is plagued by coincidence after coincidence from the beginning.  Start with LuAnn's first boyfriend's murder, cementing her decision to accept Jackson's offer as she believes herself to be a wanted fellon, up to the climatic ending set against a cliff which just so happens to exsist on the backside of LuAnn's estate in Virginia...?  Or there's the journalist that pieces the fixed lottery story together that also happen's to be Jackson's sister's boyfriend.  Makes me kind of think that this is David Baldacci's only way to move a story along.  In any case, &quot;The Winner&quot; isn't a complete loser as it moves along quickly and with decent dialogue, something most suspence novelists can barely pull off.	2000-12-18

After finishing THE LOOP this past weekend, I am at a loss of words to describe how wonderful this novel is.  Nicholas Evans' storytelling has truly blossomed since THE HORSE WHISPERER and I can't wait for his next story.<br />THE LOOP, the story of a band of wolves that attack the livestock of the fictional town of Hope, Montana, is filled with pure emotion, rich characters and beautiful descriptions.  Not many authors can pull all three of these things together with as much ease as Evans has.  Even the shocking (if somewhat unbelievable) love-interest between 29-year old Helen and 18-year old Luke is carried out with such craft that you often wonder why such a relationship is frowned upon by society.  The only problem I found was with the author's antagonist, Buck, who is stylized after any number of Larry McMurtry characters, which isn't all that bad in my eyes.	2000-11-28

David among the ranks of such great suspence novelists such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Dan Simmons or even F. Paul Wilson.  While his second novel, FRAGMENTS, starts off rather quickly and often grabs the reader by surprise, the plot seems to run consistantly thin throughout the story.  Even the editing is handicapped as it turns the novel from a Hardy Boys episode (the dialogue often sounds out of date) into a bloody gore-fest straight from the likes of &quot;Hellraiser.&quot;<br />Maybe I've missed something, after all the idea behind the story is pretty original.  This could possibly be the first ghost story/paranormal/medical thriller of our time (think: &quot;Coma&quot; meets &quot;Rainman&quot; meets &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; meets &quot;Carrie&quot;).  But I definitely felt a lack of connection to any of the characters, found the suggestive love interest between the two leads (Wes and Elizabeth) forced and unnecessary, and Gil (the bad guy) to be an oxymoron of himself (described as a character who never experiences anger yet needs that exact emotion in order to unleash his powers).  And not one of the savant characters ever felt truly &quot;real.&quot;<br />Like a poorly written episode of &quot;The X-Files,&quot; FRAGMENTS left me with unresolved feelings and with a lot to be explained.  My recommendation is to pick up David's first novel, FOOTPRINTS OF THUNDER, as it's definitely more of an entertaining read.	2000-11-07

Because I had not yet read a novel by Douglas Clegg, I took on  &quot;Purity&quot; as a way to introduce myself to a new horror author,  something I find myself reluctant to do these days considering the amount  of trash that is published.  At just shy of 120 pages and as suspenceful as  it is, &quot;Purity&quot; probably shouldn't be classified as a true horror  story even with it's use of H.P. Lovecraft's  &quot;Dagon.&quot;<br />&quot;Purity,&quot; the short story of a misunderstood  boy in love with the girl he could never have, evokes such incredible  imagery and emotion that I was left wanting more.  It's not often that an  author has an ability tap into every character's head as well as Douglas  Clegg has.  It's difficult for one to find much fault with the main  character, Owen, despite his admitted obsession for Jenna or because of his  manipulation of other characters.  Even his worshipping of an ugly  fish-like statue, Dagon, isn't as creepy as it should be only because we've  been given a chance to feel sorry for him.  On the other hand, the reader  grows to despise his love interest, Jenna, for the spoiled rich kid that  she is.  And the love triangle that unravels between Owen, Jenna and her  new boyfriend is convincingly real, filled with just the right amount of  tiwsts and an explosive climax.<br />&quot;Purity&quot; is a highly  recommended book, even at a hefty $30 price tag for it's limited edition  run.	2000-09-18

At the same time, the author  also admits that his story is a &quot;faction,&quot; much like &quot;THE  EXORCIST.&quot;  Whether or not some of the events really happened is up to  the reader to decide.<br />I picked up &quot;THE BELL WITCH&quot; after the  recent success of &quot;THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT&quot; and was hoping to  find something as equally as entertaining but this time as non-fiction.   Instead, what I read was a ghost story that was more amusing at times than  frightening, more predictable than surprising and left me feeling like less  of a believer than intended.  The discovered &quot;manuscript,&quot;  written by the local school teacher, documents the haunting of the Bell  family in too much detail to actually make the reader believe that this was  a daily journal.  This book is only one person's account of the poltergeist  and the author/editor, Brent Monahan, tries too early in his preface to  convince us that everything that lies within is all true.  The only real  mystery here is trying to decide what events may have truly happened.	2000-08-30

Sachs, at his side for the upcoming operation, takes more  interest than Rhyme in an unsolved kidnapping case that they are asked to  assist on.  Soon, Amelia finds herself in a cat &amp; mouse chase, an  accomplice to a jail-break, and responsible for the death of another cop.   And this is all within the first half of the novel.<br />After two previous  novels, I'm aquainted with the main characters, Amelia &amp; Lincoln, and  have come to accept that they don't need much more in the way of  developement (aside from maybe a little more insight as what it is Amelia  sees in Lincoln, romanticly speaking).  However, I do expect more from new  characters or those returning from previous stories that we still don't  know much about.  The villian in this novel, the Insect Boy, is pretty much  nothing more than a scared, misunderstood kid who lacks the typical evil  and violence Deaver delivers with his bad guys.  Of course, the reader is  still taken on a wild chase as the author fills every other page with a new  twist and an ended that no one can predict, but something I've come to  expect after reading his five previous novels. <br />Overall, &quot;The Empty  Chair&quot; is an enjoyable read like Jeffery Deaver's last two novels but  it lacks the originality of &quot;The Bone Collector&quot; that made it so  special.  I'm glad to hear we'll be seeing more of Mr. Deaver's earlier  work as his first novels are about to be reissued soon, which is the  author's best work to date.	2000-08-16
US	52981922	R2KG2CTXRRT5AL	0671024809	332301994	Wither	Books	3	2	3	N	N	A Witch Without a Cause	I purchased this novel on the recommendation from Amazon.com and also after reading the numerous reviews written by Amazon.com customers.  I  guess maybe I missed something here, because unlike the majority of  readers, I did not find Mr. Passarella's first book all that  impressive.<br />Much like current blockbuster films (i.e. The Craft, Blair  Witch, Scream, etc.), &quot;Wither&quot; tries to find it's niche among the  trendy suspense/comedy/slasher genre but misses the mark by just a hair.   Like other similar stories, &quot;Wither&quot; is set in a small college  town not too unlike Salem, complete with surrounding woods, covered bridges  and all.  The characters, ranging from a frightened eight-year old to a  pregnant thirty-something English Lit professor, are fairly standard and  receive an equal amount of developement time.  Even the town's annual  Halloween festival along with a 300-year old curse provide a great  backdrop, however unoriginal they may be.  In fact, my only major problem  with this novel lies within the witches themselves, who go through the  greater part of this story without much explanition or developement.   <br />Who is Wither?  And what about Rebecca &amp; Sarah?  OK, so we get a  little flashback with every new chapter, but where's the character  development, the motive(s)?  The brief history of Wither, or the demon that  she has become, barely satisfied my curiosity and reminded me too much of a  very famous vampire novel written by New Orleans Native...<br />Is  &quot;Wither&quot; a prefect story?  No.  Is &quot;Wither&quot; a fun read?   Definitely, but I'd recommend shelling your money out on the paperback  version instead.  Better yet, wait for the movie as I'm sure there will be  one.  The author is also a well known screenwriter.	2000-08-10
US	52981922	RTX8IGTWEHIV0	0385312091	98110751	The Last Sanctuary	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Another hit from Holden!	&quot;The Last Sanctuary&quot; sat on my bookshelves for the past couple years, collecting dust.  I finally picked it up after completing Holden's first novel, &quot;The River Sorrow,&quot; anxiously looking for more of  the same excellent suspenseful story telling.  I was not let down.<br />While  the main character, Joe Curtis, is not all that memorable as heros go, the  pace of the novel more than makes up for this.  With plausible situations  and personalities, entertaining twists and a climactic ending, &quot;The  Last Sanctuary&quot; proves that Holden is as entertaining as Clancy,  without all the technical writing.  Can't wait to get started on Mr.  Holden's third novel!	2000-05-30
US	52981922	R3OJIS841Z06G4	068485497X	669001158	Duane's Depressed	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Like Old Freinds	Larry McMurtry, simple put, is my favorite author.  I'm always excited to revisist his characters whether they're returning from &quot;Terms of Endearment,&quot; &quot;The Last Picture Show,&quot; or &quot;Lonesome  Dove,&quot; but always saddened to find out that I've reached the end of  these sequels and trilogies.  <br />For the first time, &quot;Duane's  Depressed&quot; didn't leave me with such sad feelings when I finished the  last page.  By some miracle, Duane Moore survives through this last volume  of the trilogy (unlike many main character's of Mr. McMurtry's other  novels) and leaves me feeling hopeful.  Often funny, sometimes depressing,  &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; is an excellent example of how well the  author can jump back into former character's minds and tell a wonderful  story.  Even if you haven't read the previous two novels in this series,  never fear: Larry McMurtry has developed these characters so well by this  time that you won't have felt liked you missed much.  <br />I would recommend  &quot;Duane's Depressed&quot; among one of my favorite's from my favorite  author.  Enjoy!	2000-05-15
US	52981922	R39D7Y1MTHOEGC	0684857146	705687442	Every Dead Thing	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Incredible Debut	Honestly, I could not believe that this was Mr. Connolly's first novel and I would rank him among names like Jeffrey Deaver and Andrew Klavan.  <br />&quot;Every Dead Thing&quot; is filled with intriguing characters  (possibly one too many, though) and an appropriate amount of sub-plots and  twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  However, I would only  recommend this thriller to those who can stand excessive gore and violence.   <br />I look forward to John Connolly's second novel!	2000-02-21
US	52981922	R2EZ1BR4CMX5F1	0684852926	79347454	The Devil's Teardrop: A Novel of the Last Night of the Century (A Lincoln Rhyme Novel)	Books	3	8	11	N	N	More of the same...	First, I would like to start off by stating that I am a huge fan of Mr. Deaver's and have enjoyed all of his previous work.  However, I did not feel &quot;The Devil's Teardrop&quot; was as strong of a novel as &quot;A  Maiden's Grave&quot; or &quot;The Bone Collector.&quot;<br />Aside from the  typical Deaver Twist ending, the pace of the plot moves along nicely and  the characters are easy to believe.  The situations, however, are sometimes  a little too far-fetched.  Otherwise, a completely enjoyable read  (although, I might not recommend this book for first-time Jeffrey Deaver  readers).	1999-12-27
US	52981922	RVFT2SCMV77WI	0394556968	139484558	Incubus	Books	4	20	21	N	N	Judge For Yourself...	I had almost decided not to even attempt this novel after reading some of the other reviews on Amazon.com from readers.  However, I have to say I  disagree with the majority of reviewers.  My theory: they all were looking  for a &quot;Horror&quot; story filled with spirits, demons, etc.  What they  got was a character study on the lives in a small town, a look into  spiritual beliefs and the wieght of personal relationships.  <br />Much like  Mr. Dobyns &quot;Church of the Dead Girls,&quot; &quot;Incubus&quot; is  more a social study of a small town when things go astray.  There are  definitly some eriee scenes and some strange happenings, but without the  blood &amp; gore of most horror novels today.<br />I would recommend this book  but not as a horror novel.  Instead, a novel that looks into Middle-America  and small town life.	1999-11-01
US	52981922	R3LI8AW44O6TGD	0609601121	264340887	The Uncanny	Books	3	4	6	N	N	Fun, but not as interesting as hoped...	Upon reading Andrew Klavan's True Crime, I figured that anything following would be of equal caliber.  Unfortunately, the author missed the mark with this novel.  The characters are interesting but just barely, the plot lacks  a certain thrill and the ending left me with some unanswered questions,  which may have been Mr. Klavan's intentions.  I would not classify this  novel as a horror/ghost story, maybe not even a thriller or mystery, as  most reviewers have.  Instead I think this book needs to be placed under  the &quot;Possible TV Movie of the Week&quot; section.	1999-10-05
US	52981922	R3TOVHQSJ2GTCN	0312193513	554035045	Vespers	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Not that original, but very (very) fun!	The story may not be all that original: giant bats try to take over New York city and the only two people that can stop them are both disfunctional characters. So, it won't win an major awards for it's plot, but if you are a fan of Hitchcock's &quot;Birds&quot;, Disney's &quot;Arachnapobia&quot; and &quot;Mimic&quot;, then this is a book for you. And no wonder that it has already been picked up by Touchstone (again, Disney). <br />The author takes you on a rollercoaster ride of thrills and violence while providing an education on the modern bat and NY's history. The main character's aren't all that interesting themselves, but the fast-pace and action make up for it. Like Crichton and Preston, Jeff Rovin uses his knowledge of science and history to win his readers over by making his plot more realistic and believable. This paperback is worth it, especially if you need a quick summertime read.	1999-07-14

Unfortunately, unless you've actually lived some of the experiences the  author has, you might not find most of the humor as laugh-out-loud funny as  I did.	1999-06-28
