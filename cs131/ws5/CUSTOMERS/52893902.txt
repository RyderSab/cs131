Beginning with the creation of the basic box score and scorecard and continuing to the development of statistical measurements only an MIT scientist could comprehend, Schwarz takes the reader behind the scene into the evolution of baseball statistics in the mid-18th century through the recent years of sabremeticians such as the well known Bill James and a host of lesser known, but no less important, creators of new methods to analyze the sport of baseball. <br /> <br />Schwarz wisely does not get heavily into the statistical design of new formulas that correlate batter activities with runs, or pitcher strikeouts with runs prevented. Instead he attempts to bring into focus the individuals who collected, sorted, and analyzed the data.  There are many baseball fans who are likely to recognize names like Seymour Siwoff, John Thorn, Peter Palmer, and John Dewan as editors of several major baseball reference works, but how many know who these men are and why they <br />have spend years of their lives devoted to baseball statistics?  Schwarz provides mini-biographies of many of these individuals as a means to understanding their life long devotion to baseball stats.     <br /> <br />Schwarz covers a wide area: the history of today's recognized baseball statistics; the pioneers and today's computer geeks; the rivalries (such as Elias verus STATS); the slow accceptance of new analytical methods of player capabilities among the baseball establishment and the very recent rise to power of statistic gurus without ballplaying experience into the executive levels of team baseball.  Anyone who found Michael Lewis' Moneyball of interest should run out and get this book to learn the background story behind the use of computer-generated baseball statistics as the logical replacement tool for old-timer gut instinct to analyze ballplayers.	2004-08-18

In order to fit in the large number of mini reviews and commentaries for the selected entries the editors had to omit a good number of films that many would have deemed worthy of inclusion.  The most egregious omissions were of silent films, of which only a relatively small number were included from the many years before the beginning of sound films.  Film buffs may argue with some of the selections, but the inclusion of &quot;small&quot; and cult films alongside the well-known Academy Award winners is to be applauded.  The editors, though, were often sloppy with the sidebar award section, giving a film credit for an Oscar win when only a nomination was received.  There are several instances when at least two films from the same year were cited as winning the same Oscar.  For those like myself who can recite year-by-year the Oscar award winners and nominees, the sidebar errors detracted from the scholarship of the work.	2004-06-14

It is sometimes hard keeping track of the Storms chronology from book to book, but it appears that the newest novel tracks the most recent Storms shenanigans although the book begins in the middle, then quickly backtracks a short time until it catches up to where we came in.<br />The plot involves a myriad of subplots, but the main focus is Storms' need to discover who supposedly killed his father many decades earlier.  Throughout the book are several flashbacks to the early 1960s when Storms' father gets mixed up with the mob and an infamous jewelry heist by Murph the Surf. The plot in current time also includes a quartet of condiment salesmen who should have spent more time at their convention instead of hooking up with Storms through his newly formed travel agency,  a host of Mafia-types with a link back to Storms's father's story, and various members of the FBI and CIA. A few characters from early Storms adventures occasionally pop up, and at times its hard to keep track of who is chasing who.  <br />As usual in a Dorsey book there are usually a few chuckles every page, and a frequent bellylaugh every few pages.  Dorsey's humor comes from both character and plotline, and it is sometimes hard to remember that people are often dying around Storms and his compatriots in crime while you cry from laughter.	2004-03-28

More than a few of the topics are opportunities for Russo to vent his opinions and/or suggestions on a particular sports issue, although the bulk of the book does focus on argument issues that most sports enthusiasts have participated in one time or another.  One drawback is that many lists of greatest players or games is limited to Russo's personal history, dating back to the 1960s, although a few old timers occasionally pop up in the essays. <br />Russo has his biases, and some of his analyses are questionable. For example, batting average is given far greater emphasis than the more reliable on base percentage for evaluating players. Some of his picks will create controversy, and some bewilderment. For example, selecting the 1963 Los Angeles Dodgers pitching staff as one of the greatest when the starters, excepting Sandy Koufax, barely won more than they lost, or choosing Sammy Sosa, over Ruth, McGwire, or Bonds, as the guy you would choose when you needed a home run for one at bat. He does deserve more than a few kudos, however, when he appears to be going against the crowd when bypassing Michael Jordan as the top pick in a few categories;  real sports fans agree with him that Jordan's selection by ESPN as greatest 20th century athlete was questionable. Also, selecting Alex Rodriguez over Honus Wagner as the greatest shortstop may rustle the feathers of oldtimers, but its a bold choice.<br />The book may have benefitted by including more statistics to back up some selections, and also including some additional background information on a few of the athletes discussed, but overall it was a quick and enjoyable read.	2003-06-20

Staten uses a baseball game attended by himself and his son to provide the reader with interesting information and anecdotes about non-playing aspects of the game and the sport. This book is not for fans into sabermetrics or player bios.  This book is for fans who want to know more about topics peripheral to the actual game, such as how: stadiums are architected; playing fields are maintained; balls and bats are designed; ballpark food and souvenirs are selected and sold. We never really learn why foul poles and foul lines are fair in baseball, while their equivalents in other sports are not, but the the reader does enjoy learning more about the trivial details and background of baseball's infrastructure and history.	2003-06-20

Neyer selects a series of all-time lineups for each baseball team, ranging from the best to worst.  His personal selections will amuse many and anger some.  Some players, like Paul Molitor, pop up several times within the same team chapter at different positions, as well as for different teams, while some Hall of Famers barely make the Number 2 all-time best team for their respective teams. Each player listed is accompanied by a short sentence explaining the selection.<br />A minor criticism of the book is that the selections appear more heavily weighted towards players of recent vintage, especially the all-time bust teams. Neyer does more properly accomodate the old-timers for teams such as the Athletics and Braves who played in several cities throughout their existence by having an abridged section following the current team line-ups.<br />The best part of the book may not be the actual player selections, but each chapter's several short essays focusing on an individual selected player or group of players.  Without resorting to somewhat uncomprehensible Sabremetric-like statistics commonly found in many new baseball books, Neyer provides the reader with information about the ballplayers that is new and/or amusing. He even disagrees with his former employer Bill James, the eminent baseball Sabremetrician, on a few selections and issues, with factual proof in support of his position.  <br />Overall a very good baseball book for the casual or fanatic fan.	2003-06-10

Stone inadvertently becomes involved with an international assassin being pursued by Carpenter, one of Stone's paramours from his London vist.  The elusive assassin happens to be a very attactive and cunning female who holds a grudge against the British secret service, and is known as La Biche.  Before you know it there are numerous dead bodies around NYC, with Stone and his former NYPD partner Dino Bachetti involved in the chase.<br />As usual, Stone and his friends spend a lot of time at Elaine's, a well known Manhattan restaurant frequented by celebrities, and running around various expensive city hotels and landmarks.  Stone's relationship with Carpenter heats up as the number of dead bodies accumlate. La Biche also manages several sexual encounters along the way with a few innocent bystanders who she disposes of when they are no longer of use to her.<br />Readers of the series know what to expect when they pick up a Stone Barrington novel, and Woods does not disappoint: a fast moving plot with some sex and killing every other chapter or two.	2003-06-09

The past book had Antonelli heading south from Portland, Oregon, to San Francisco, and now he is in Hollywood defending a famous director (and studio head) accused of murdering his movie star wife.  A combination legal thriller and Hollywood-based melodrama, Buffa places Antonelli in a middle of recognizable Hollywood types drawn from real life, with elements of the O.J Simpson case thrown in. In a cute twist, the reader is made aware early that Antonelli will be a character in a big movie.  Like a snake devouring its own tail the fictional murder story  evolves into a fictional movie as the plot progresses.<br />As usual Antonelli will have a close relationship with an attractive female character, and numerous clues will be dropped along the way to point the reader in one of several directions regarding the killer. Hopefully, Antonelli will not return to Hollywood, and return to accused murderers who engender more sympathy from the reader.	2003-06-09

Davenport now works for a Minnesota state agency, the BCA, under Rose, his old superior from the Minneapolis police department.  A murder scene that resembles a lynching is enough to bring in Davenport and his partner Del to invesigate and clean up before a major political crisis can begin.  The murder scene is discovered by a very unusual 12 year old girl, Letty West, who talks and acts many years her senior.  Davenport enlists Letty's help in his investigation, which revolves around the hanging murders, multiple kidnappings, a car theft ring, and drug smuggling.  The individual crimes are linked through several threads that are not apparent at first to Davenport or the several law enforcement groups he is working with on the case.<br />Davenport's domestic scenes with his wife Weather are kept to a minimum in this yarn, with almost all of the action focused on the crimes.  Letty West takes center stage, and she proves more than a match for Davenport.  She traps muskrats, totes a rifle, drives pickups, swears a lot, and helps pick up the pace of the book whenever she appears (which is often). There is strong rapport between Davenport and Letty, and the foundations are set for the making of a good team in future editions of the series.	2003-06-09

The main story plot is Dr. Seidman's attempt to find his missing baby daughter,and revolve the fatal shooting of his wife and near-fatal shooting of himself when the abduction took place. Along the way he is primarily assisted by his attorney friend, medical partner, an old girlfriend who just happens to be a forcibly retired FBI agent, and a gung ho ex-soldier who surprisingly helps Seidman instead of shooting him during an attempted break-in.  As usual in a Coben story, Seidman has to fight against the bad guys/gals while evading representatives of the law (police, FBI). <br />There is little humor in No Second Chance, and no wealthy, mysterious and dangerous sidekick assisting the hero protagonist, as there are in Coben's Myron Bolitar series.  What we get is a very fast paced novel with a few expected and unexpected twists.	2003-05-27

Storms and his pursuit of five million dollars he originally conned from a crooked insurance company in the first book of the series several years ago, Florida Roadkill.  Tim Dorsey writes Serge A. Storms as a likeable pyschopathic serial killer. Charming one minute, insane killer the next. His main obession in the new book are trains, and the reader will learn a lot of archaic information about the topic while Storms pontificates every once in a while about the topic. <br />The Stingray Shuffle brings back several of the whacky characters from earlier books, such as Johnny Vegas, provides an explanation for Serge's amnesia in the third novel Orange Crush, while continuing the plotline from the ending of the Hammerhead Ranch Motel book. The new book features many new characters  who drop in and out of the plot, including more than a few who die a tragic, but funny, death.  Dorsey folds the book into itself by including a subplot about a book called \\"The Stingray Shuffle\\" with a similar plot as the real book itself.  It becomes hard to know when you are reading about something in the \\"real\\" book as opposed to the \\"ficticious\\" book, both with the same name.  As the plot moves from Florida to New York City, and back to Florida, most of the living characters collide on an Amtrak train ride where several of the loosely connected plotlines reach their climax. <br />Anyone interested in spending a few hours reading and laughing out loud should grab this book.	2003-04-07

The usual cast of characters surrounding Ms. Cooper are back to assist her in investigating a mysterious death at the Metropolitan Museum of Art: a dead museum worker is discovered in a mummy's tomb.  Previous novels in the series showed that Ms. Fairstein knows her way around the Manhattan District Attorney's, especially the sex crimes division, and now her knowledge of NYC's landmark museums is on display.  Some mystery readers may be put off by a relative lack of action, but there will be many who will enjoy the book primarily for the characters and setting.  A subplot carried over from an earlier entry in the series is introduced while Ms. Cooper goes about her methodical investigation of the murder at hand.

The book's main problem is not with omissions, but with personal commentaries that reflect the personal tastes of the author.  For example, many of Hollywood's most successful directors, such as Ford and Wyler, are dismissed with a few backhanded compliments, while far too much space is accorded to oddities like Warhol, and directors such as Edgar Ulmer (with few worthwhile films to be noticed). Sometimes there are valid reasons why obscure directors should remain obscure.<br />Casual film fans may find some of Thomson's comments and criticisms surprising, because he often shows disdain for popular and/or Academy Award winning films and actors/actresses, but it is sometimes justified. More serious students will find Thomson's effort worthwhile, because he often goes against the mainstream flow.	2003-01-01

Nicholas Fashon, around which the plot revolves, has inherited the rights to his grandfather's all-purpose kitchen gadget the Handy Mate (one of many doohickey inventions the old man fiddled around with). Getting the Handy Mate manufactured and marketed is Fashon's goal to make it big, but there are many roadblocks in his way, including a violent loanshark, a sexy female chef, and the police who suspect Fashon of torching his apparel store for insurance money. The book's humor is derived from twists in the plot and nonsensical situations between Fashon and a number of secondary characters, in a similar vein to earlier Hautman books.  It is highly enjoyable, and good for a laugh or two every few pages.	2002-12-24

Baby Boomers who have watched the show from its beginning may not learn anything startingly new that they have not probably read in the gossip columns and tabloids these past 27 years, but the Gen X &amp; Y SNL viewers of today may be amused by how the show was created and how it evolved.<br />It is not surprising how many of the people interviewed for the book, including all of the major creative and artistic SNL participants, claim credit for much of the show's success, while pawning off failures and disasters on others.  The book is strongly focused on the early years, concentrating on Lorne Michaels and the original seven cast members, then moves more quickly through the 1980s and 1990s.  The authors provide little of their own commentary, preferring to let those interviewed tell the story from their perspective.	2002-11-29

Triggerfish Twist is highly comic, often laugh out loud, that has several parallel plot lines that eventually merge into one final climax.  Serge Storms is a highly likable character, despite his propensity to rob and murder people, who is part genius and part lunatic.  <br />The main plot of the book takes place in Tampa, and features plenty of local color sure to antagonize the town's natives, who are likely to object being portrayed as the cartoonish characters they may actually be.  Dorsey takes wicked potshots at used car salemen, consultants, little old ladies, banks, television news reporters, college academics, and others worthy of derision.

Similar to Tell No One, Gone for Good's narrative focuses on a protagonist, Will Klein, who is under suspicion by law authorities in the disappearance and death of a loved one. Will,like Myron Bolitar, has a close friend (the rich and mysterious Squares) who assists him in his search for the truth and to clear himself of any wrongdoing.<br />As in all of Coben's earlier works there are are peripheral characters from both sides of the law who complicate matters for the hero.  One of the most interesting is Ghost, who appears to be a very dangerous killer, but who has some surprises up his sleeve.  Ghost's relationship to Will Klein, Will's missing brother (an accused murderer), and Will's father is the hingepoint of the novel,and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat everytime he pops up in the plot.<br />Although followers of the the Bolitar sereies may find the latest Coben novels, including Gone for Good, too dark for their taste, the more realistic complex characters and driving plot lines provides for a richer reading experience.	2002-07-14

Westlake) is the flip side from the author's comedic Dortmunder series. Parker is tough, no nonsense, and kills when necessary.  His latest job teams him up with a gang of crooks looking to resteal some masterpiece paintings from a nouveau riche com-type billionaire who is less than honest.  The paintings are secreted in a hidden location in the billionaire's luxurious hunting lodge.  This book follows a familiar Parker plot outline: the crooks get together to plan a heist; Parker gets involved in some side business; plans go awry; things get improvised.  In this book Parker's side business builds to a climax, but then ends too quickly. The final heist sequence packs suspense and action.<br />One reads a Parker book knowing that one cuts straight to the action, with little of the fat and detours found in too many crime books these days.  Parker is not someone you would want to meet in a dark alley, but you do enjoy reading about.	2001-12-22

Rag Man is less humorous than his preceding books, but no less entertaining.  The fact that the two central characters both have redundant names, Mac Macwray and Lars Larson, tells the reader that not everything that happens should be taken seriously. Mac and Lars were partners in a garment business, hence the title of the book, but when Lars takes off with company funds Mac discovers he was taken by a con artist who set him up from the start. Mac undergoes a major personality changed during the novel, effectively turning into Lars.  The plot is laced with sex, murder, blackmail, and other assorted goodies.

Daley is not highly convinced that his client is totally innocent, but works hard to punch holes in the prosecution team's charges in attempt to at least hang the trial jury.  The defense team is a Daley family affair:  his co-counsel partner is his ex-wife; the assisting PI is his brother; his brother-in-law provides invaluable assistance.  Siegel manages to tie together a vast network of characters who Daley believes involved in the murder case, ranging from pimps, porn and drug dealers, crooked millionaire, conniving family members, and shady politicans and lawyers.  The plot outcome may be too-nicely tied up and packaged for some readers, but the action in and out of the courtroom should satisfy readers who enjoyed the first Daley book.	2001-10-17

Dr. David Beck's idealic marriage to Elizabeth is shattered when she is murdered under strange circumstances, and eight years after the event it appears that she may not be dead. When new evidence turns up associating Dr. Beck with the past &quot;crime&quot; and a new murder of an old friend, the doctor goes on the lam. There is an assortment of secondary characters, ranging from a vengeful billionaire to a drug dealer to a pair of deadly hitmen, that spice up the plot as it moves forward to a suprising conclusion with several twists and turns along the way. The usual humor and wisecracks associated with Coben's Myron Bolitar series are missing from ths book, and may disappoint fans expecting another seriocomic romp, but Tell No One should attract a wider audiencer for the writer. Coben knows how to create a suspense scene, even when the reader knows the protagonist will somehow make his escape to continue his adventure. All of the miscellaneous plot points are neatly pulled together, and at the conclusion of the book the reader finally understands the true meaning of the title.	2001-08-30

Death Benefits introduces us to John Walker and Max Stillman, investigators for a large family-owned insurance company, who are looking for Ellen Snyder, a missing young female insurance executive who is thought to have participated in a fraudulent $12 million death benefit claim.  Walker is a deskbound claims analyst who is chosen by the mysterious Stillman, a hired private investigator, to find Ms. Snyder, and maybe the money.  Walker has a past relationship with the missing Ms. Snyder, and Stillman plans to exploit this fact to track down his prey.<br />The experienced Stillman and the young, almost naive Walker make an interesting pair, flying from one city to another, running into trouble along the way, committing a few break-ins and burglaries, and discovering that a giant conspirancy may be behind fraudulent death benefit claims.  Perry throws in humor along the way, and is very good at balancing the knowing Stillman with the neophyte Walker.  Throw in Serena, a mysterious computer hacker, who assists the insurance guys in their quest for the truth, and the end result is an enjoyable romp in the intrigue of insurance fraud.

Using terms such as corporate liberals to define characters in films, and classifying films as either right-wing or left-wing biased, Biskind dissects several well-known films, and more than a few not well-known, from the early Cold War era based on uncommon film criticsm methods. The book is not for the typical movie fan, but for readers with more intellectual pursuits in mind.<br />Biskind often reads too much into the films he analyzes to substantiate his points, and will quote dialogue out of context from a film under discussion, or from other films of the time.  It is doubtful that the producer, director, or writer of a science fiction film like &quot;Them&quot; imagined their science fiction action adventure about giant ants taking over the world to be as complex as Biskind makes it out to be. It is rare that giant ant films are analyzed in the same book as such 1950's classics as &quot;On The Waterfront&quot; and &quot;Rebel Without a Cause.&quot; Knowing the Hollywood studio assembly line structure of time, and the large number of contract employees who provided input into any one film, it is difficult to believe that the large number of disparate films analyzed in the book would follow the same general set of character and plot rules as Biskind imagines.<br />The reading may not be light and easygoing, but &quot;Seeing is Believing&quot; gives the reader new food for thought the next time  one of the films discussed in the book pops up on cable television.	2000-12-24

Westlake may be known primarily for his comedic crime novels, particularly the Dortmunder series, but when writing as Richard Stark displays a much darker personality.  Stark's Parker novels were on a long sabatical, but in the past few years have come back strong.  The latest book has a relatively straight forward plot in which Parker attempts to get even with a crime gang he hooked up with before a parting of the ways.  The Parker novels have some humor, but there is no mistaking the hard edge of the lead character who will kill at a moment's notice if things don't go his way. A Parker novel is best described as hard, and this one is no exception.    The title refers to the modus operandi used by a crime gang when pulling of bank heists or a really big jewelry job. Parker feels cheated out of his share of the former caper, and plots to get even with his former cronies.  Parker needs money to realize his scheme, and goes on a crime spree, netting more money than originally at stake, before heading to Palm Beach, the site of the novel's main action. Some readers may find the crime spree more interesting than the later action. In addition to the main plot, there is a subplot threatening Parker's life that has the potential to change the entire direction of the book.  <br />Fans of Westlake's lighter crime books should definitely check out the Stark novels.  Those who saw Mel Gibson in Payback, an early Parker novel may be surprised that Parker is not the anti-hero type, but a flat-out criminal and killer (when necessary).	2000-12-17

The cast of characters is the same, and much old ground is retread.  The early Scarpetta book's had some interesting mystery plots for its readers, but the last few have been character driven. Kay Scarpetta, MD/JD, is a Chief Medical Examiner who thinks she's a detective, often overstepping her boundaries in doing police work beyond her responsibilities.  Facing another major personal crisis when faced with a murder indictment, Dr. Scarpetta attempts to resolve several murder cases revolving around the last novel's plot involving a French-born &quot;Wolfman&quot; who claims innocence.<br />Unlike some of the past few novels which had fast moving, although convoluted, plots, the current book takes its time to get to the action. There are too many detours, including a rehash of plot points from two and three novels back.  Readers new to the Scarpetta books are likely to find it difficult to follow the current installment. Ongoing readers may become impatient waiting for something new to happen before realizing that the peripheral murders and plot points will all be neatly tied up quickly in the end.	2000-12-10

Bourdain spices up this tale of a young chef caught up in a FBI sting operation targeted at organized crime in NYC with numerous scenes of mouth watering food preparation scenes.  The mob characters sometimes behave too much like cartoon versions of the real thing, but the young protoganist, an aspiring chef who happens to be the nephew of mobster Sally Wig (an overweight loan shark, knee breaker, and sloppy eater) is written as a real character looking to escape from his &quot;Family&quot; roots.  The frequenly humorous plot is mixed with occasional violence, several interesting supporting characters, and more than a few things you probably don't want to know about restaurants.	2000-11-08

Books	3	8	8	N	N	All About Eve (and the rest of the cast)	The author does not make a claim that his book is of the scholarly analytical school of film analysis, but an undertaking of a film enthusiast, particularly the movie in question.  Mr. Staggs provides much interesting background material on what is generally regarded as one of the true adult films coming out of Hollywood during the studio era.  Some of his anecdotes are old, but he often adds additional details not provided elsewhere.  One problem with the book is that he often strays from the subject at hand, and relates a story about one of the actors that is unrelated to All About Eve.  For example, Marilyn Monroe, a featured player with a very small part, receives far too much attention from Mr. Staggs.<br />A highlight of the book is a detailed discussion of the genesis of the original story upon which the film is based, and the aftermath of the woman upon who Eve is based.<br />The book may have benefited from a more detailed description of the plot.  Buyers of the book are best served if they view the film just prior to a reading, even if they have seen the film before.	2000-09-23

Myron appears to be maturing in his latest  adventure, but the novel is still laced with humor and enough plot twists  to keep the reader involved until the end.  This is the first Bolitar  mystery in which sports is relegated to the background, although Myron's  usual supporting cast remains front and center.<br />Coben throws a lot of  curves at the reader during the middle of the novel, but things are  straightened out in the end, with all of the loose strings neatly tied up.   As usual, Myron and Win's mysterious secret government-related backgrounds  come into play, as does Myron's college basketball days.  Driving back and  forth between New York and New Jersey at a dizzying pace, without hint of  traffic jams through the Lincoln Tunnel, Myron and Win often act like  demented Hardy Boys, with one-liners flying at a quick pace.  Coben has  advised readers that he will be taking a break from the Myron Bolitar  series, but Darkest Fear will more than satisfy his loyal readers for the  time being.	2000-08-13

The previous book ended in  a cliffhanger regarding Stephanie's romantic decision between Joe Morelli  and Ranger, and the reder of Hot Six doesn't have to wait long before  discovering who Ms. Plum has chosen.  Both Joe and Ranger figure  prominently in this book, as does the usual cast of characters,  particularly Stephanie's grandmother (who is sharper, and hipper than  usually portrayed).<br />The local flavor of central New Jersey, and the  humorous detours Ms. Evanovich takes the reader on, make Hot Six an  enjoyable read.  Ms. Evanovich makes the reader cares for the characters,  and the characters' actions and reactions to the surrounding drama makes  the novel fly along at a rapid pace.	2000-08-01

This well researched book goes beyond the Mae West and gangster  films, and offers a penetrating look at many forgotten films that were  aimed at an adult audience in the time period between the advent of sound  in the late 1920's and 1934, when the Hollywood Production Code was written  and adhered to.  Before Hollywood went &quot;Hollywood&quot; to present a  fairy tale portrayal of 1930's depression America, a surprisingly high  number of films addressing realistic social issues and sexual mores were  written, filmed, and released to a wide audience.  It would be almost  thirty years before Hollywood would return to, and go beyond, its pre-code  roots.<br />Doherty includes discussions of many well-known films in his  narrative, but also does justice to long-forgotten films rarely seen since  their original release. Although films stars such as Barbara Stanwyck and  James Cagney established their screen presence and characters in the  pre-code films, we usually remember them for their later work, with a few  rare exceptions like Cagney's Public Enemy.  Doherty recalls the early  films of stars like these, and also remembers actors and actresses unknown  to the current generation of filmgoers.<br />Many of the films covered in this  book were ventures with low or moderate budget ventures, but they had a  strong impact on audiences.  Comparing a pre-code Warners musical like 42  Street to one of its post-code counterparts, like Golddiggers of 1935  illustrates the major change in tone and attitude films acquired as a  result of the code.  Pre-code language was stronger, more skin was shown,  and plots were not sugar-coated with mandatory happy endings.  Doherty  paints a strong picture of a movie era too often glossed over in most film  histories.	2000-07-30

Aided by his trustworthy support staff, including his girl friend (if not girlfriend) Christina, Ben battles the evil forces of big  business accused of polluting well water that causes an outbreak of  leukemia in a small Tulsa suburban community.  The pieces of the story take  time to come together, including reasons for including apparently  dissimilar incidents which took place  months and years before the novel's  main action.  In addition to the civil action, there are several murders  related to Ben's case, although he does not make the connection until late  in the plot.  Bernhardt keeps the action moving, interspersing the usual  Ben Kinkaid humor.  The courtroom scenes may not resemble real-life  litigation, but the reader remains interested in the precedings, and  nervously waits with Ben for the verdict.  Silent Justice is the flipside  of A Civil Action, and a far easier read.	2000-03-09

Although some of the plot  points are a little hard to believe, e.g., a nation of Mafia families  working as efficiently as the FBI to find Jane and her runners, and Jane's  almost unlimited reserve of financial resources, Perry keeps the reader's  interest as Jane and company race around country trying to turn dirty money  into clean charitable donations.	2000-02-22

Rather early in the book, Bernie gathers all the suspects together to do  his best Nick Charles impersonation to weed out the culprit behind the  murder he is accused of. <br />Unlike earlier Burglar books, this one has plot  twists that are too transparent.  Every character in the book is involved  with the murder, desired letters, or missing jewels (an integrated subplot)  even if not readily apparent at first. Telltale clues are left throughout  the plot to enable wily mystery lovers to guess the outcome too early in  the procedings.	1999-07-30

Also  detracting from the story is the problem that many of the trial judge's  rulings are so prejudicial that an appeals court would overturn a guilty  verdict for Ben's client.

Kinsey appears to have wandered into a town where everyone knows everyone else, and they turn against her when she stumbles into several old murders best left unsolved. Earlier books in the series had better, more intricate, plots with greater substance.  Its not difficult to guess who the unknown assailant is in this book, even though some important information is withheld from the reader until the end.	1998-05-08

The European locale adds flavor to the plot; the internal politics of a unified western Europe organization makes for interesting reading.  Readers know what to expect from Ms. Lathen, and will not be dissapointed.  Hopefully the series will continue despite the death of one of the two co-authors using the Emma Lathen pseudonym.	1998-04-02
US	52893902	RFAAXZEAWNVBN	0385320175	326768810	Numbered Account	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Good mystery read, with somewhat cardboard characters	The Swiss banking scene takes its hits when a young ex-Marine, ex-Wall Street, Harvard MBA protagonist seeks answers to his father's death.  Some interesting insights into the secrets of the Swiss banking industry are coupled with the middle-East conflict, nuclear bombs, drug dealers, and covert US military operations.  The author could should have edited down some some of the secondary plot lines while focusing more on the hero's pursuit of justice for his father's killer. It was somewhat implausible how all the loose-ends tied together in the end, but the reader's interest is sustained.	1998-03-31
