I have read Frances Mayes' books about Tuscany several times and love them so much, I though, oh, just another writer trying to write like her. But I was totally wrong. Carol Drinkwater buys a farm in southern France just like Mayes does in Tuscany, but there stops the similarity.<br />Carol Drinkwater's style of writing is unique in the way she let us take part in her life. The book is so much more than a book about buying a farm, it is a love story to the man in her kife she has just met, it is the story of how to adjust in the life of being a step mother, it is a story of adapting another country and it's inhabitants. And her writing is so good you just melt into the book, can't put it down, feel you are there at the farm with her.<br />What I liked most about the book si that it shows several aspacts of the &quot;sweet life&quot;. Not everything is romantic, we also meet the shadows of the life of buying the farm. Drinkwater opens her heart to the readers for good and for worse, and this way she makes to book a masterpiece of the love story literature.<br />Thanks for this book. I have already ordered it's sequel and know that when it arrives I will need to put aside anything else for some reading hours.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2003-09-12

Yoshiko Jinzenji has made a beautiful book showing her magnificient quilts and pieces of fabric arts.<BR> <BR>The book itself, photos, paper, printing, writing, style, is a piece of art. A book you will be happy to own, no matter if you are a quilter or just a book lover. A perfect coffee table book for any home, though this one is so much more than a coffee table book. This book deserves to be read and be looked through again and again. <br />Yoshiko Jinzenji has been a quilter for a lifetime, and during these years she has developed her own unique and perfect style. We get to know Jinzenji through the pages of the book, both through words and through pictures. We meet her and her quilts in Kyoto, and we meet her in her studio in Bali. The book also have a section on how to make quilts, easy to read, easy to follow the step by step instructions. Jinzenji makes her quilts from ancient fabric collected from around the world, and she makes her quilts from natural dyes in light, clean colors. But no matter what the fabric is, her vibrant quilts all stand out and have all their own story to tell <br />The highlights in the book though are the pictures. The somewhat clean and stylish picture of a Small Modern Amish quilt displayed on the wall in her Kyoto home, the fantastic puzzle of an uncountable number of small Mandala quilts put together to form a universe in colors, cloths and patterns, the collague of many pictures from scenes around her studio in Bali as inspirations for future quilts. <br />The way the writing and photos in the book are put together shows the reader a new way to look at the surroundings, and through that a new way to look at life. Or to say it with the words from the foreword of the book, written by textile designer Jun'ichi Arai; I am convinced that Yoshiko Jinzenji's achievements in establishing a new genre in quilting will never be forgotten.	2003-04-30

With easy to follow step by step instructions this book gives you alot of crafty ideas. Not only to make for your children. I find the book even more useful for making craft with my children.<br />The book is divided into four sections, The Playroom, The Nursery, The Bathroom and The Bedroom. And each section gives various ideas. In the playroom you find the bunny rocksack for examle, the cutest little rucksack any kid will love wearing to kindergarten, or on a shopping trip with grandma. For the nursery there is instructions for a rag book, and why not use the instructions to make a rag book using the drawings made by your own child? The ideas in the book are so many, I will not mention them all, but what about dressing gowns and slippers using your kid's design, or an owl quilt for the bedroom.<br />The last part of the book is filled with useful techniques and tips, so you don't have to be a master to make the crafts of this book.

The Danish journalist Carsten Jensen travelled from Russia south in Asia, through China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Hong Kong, and memories from these travels are collected in this huge book. And there are not only memories. Jensen has an open eye and tries to explain what he sees, and make it part of a bigger context, our world.<br />Jensen travels alone, but he meets local people on his way. And he is not afraid of making contact. Many of these people are there for us to meet through the book. I Have Seen the World Begin is not a romantic story. Here we meet all the dirt of poverty, all the dust of the landscape, all the evilness in people, though we also meet the beauty of the women in Vietnam, the charm of a poor guide in a small village in China, the greatness of a landscape. Travelling might be boring and depressing, or it might give new dimensions to your life. Jensen has experienced both.<br />And where does the world begin according to Carsten Jensen? It began for him in the birth of his child. The world is alive, the world is a place which will go on living inspite all odds<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-08-27

But there were fantasy books before Harry came. The German writer Michael Ende is one of the many writers who have written wonderful stories, both for children and for grown ups. The story about Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver is one of them.<br />Luke lives on a tiny, tiny island together with just a handful of other people. One day the postman arrives with a very special delivery, a small packet containing an even smaller little boy. The boy remains at the island and gets the name Jim Button. <br />Everybody loves Jim, but when he growns bigger the island becomes too small for the people living there. Luke decides that he is the one who has to go, toether with his tank engine. Jim goes with him, in secret, and from here on the adventures of the two friends starts.<br />The book is a wonderful tale of friendship and love, and also a story to teach children to overcome their fears, to believe in their own strength, and still be allowed to show your weakness. I have read the book together with my six years old daughter, and it has given us many great reading hours. Actually we are still enjoying being together with Jim and Luke, now reading the sequel to the book.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-08-21

Her novels are not all that long, but she always gives great ideas for other reading. And The Biographer's Tale is no exception.<br />The graduate student Phineas Nanson need sa change in his life after the death of his mother, and he decides that his life needs to be filled with things, not only ideas. This desicion brings him to the biographer Scholes Destry-Scholes who has written a biography of the Victorian polymath Elmer Bole. Phineas reads Destry-Scoles' biography over and over and wonders more and more if it is possible for a biographer to find the truth about the person they write about. Phineas wants to write a biography of Scholes Destry-Scoles and this takes him to Africa, to Sweden and to Norway. Not in actually travelling, at least not in the beginning, but nevertheless he follows the footsteps of Destry- Scoles.<br />Through the book, and through Phineas' research, Byatt let us get to know Carl Linneaus, Francis Galton and Henrik Ibsen. The book is stuffed with information, and given to us in a rather unusual way; through notecards Phineas finds after Scholes Destry-Scoles.<br />Writing the biogarphy, or trying to write it, doesn't take Phineas in the direction he was hoping though, and he understands that the change has to come in his own life. Can any of the two women in Phineas' life help him with this, or is this a journey he has travel alone?<br />A.S.Byatt is a master of words, and as in her other novels, this one has to be read several times, and you will discover new information every time.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-08-18

Did he really have a bear named Winniw the Pooh, did the Hundred Acre Wood excist, did he and Pooh play on Poohstick Bridge? What a fantastic childhood he must have had?<br />Of course the imagination in my mind was not all correct, at least not the fantastic childhood part. In this book Christopher Milne tells us from his heart how it was to be the son of A.A.Milne, the creator of all our childhood friends. The book is written with alot of charm, but we can also read between the lines about the negative effects of being a &quot;famous&quot; child, a boy with a childhood who belonged to, and still belong to the whole world.<br />If you know Winnie the Pooh, and who doesn't, this book is a little diamond, a book full of great details, a book which gives a unique view of the Christopher Robin myth.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-07-16

Or, no, may be this is not actually a problem; letters from the bank can easily get lost, phonecalls from the bank can be denied because you are too ill to speak to them, and of course next month you will be able to pay, when you win the top prize in the national lottery.<br />Rebecca is another female, single Londongirl, following in the line of so many others, starting with Bridget Jones. And the story about Rebecca is so funny written, once you start the book you want to read non stop untill the end. Will she be able to pay her debt, will she CB (Cut Back) or will she MMM (Make More Money) The most enjoyable side of the book is that it spotlights so many of today's shopping habits, where the only comfort is to buy oneself a little something. And of course shopping is the meaning of life, well, at least looking at prizetags is.

And loved every word of it.<BR>Like the first Jane Green I read, Jemima J, this one is about the life of single Londoners, following the footprints of Bridget Jones. But still the book is worth it's own money, and is not at all predictable and boring.<br />A gang of University friends stay together for years after they left school, though they have lost contact with one of the girls from the gang, the beautiful Portia, queen of the gang. She broke their hearts one night and after that drifted away from the close gang. Life goes on, Josh marries Lucy, Cath stays single being hurt one time to many, and the gay Si is always hunting for the perfect man of his life.<br />The book is a wonderful, charming and witty story about friendship. How to give everything for your friends, how to stay together through thick and thin. Though the part of the book that charms be most is Bookends, the bookshop and café Cath and Lucy opens. Through this Cath meets James, but is this man the one for her? Jane Green has a charmimg way to take us through the every day life of her characters.<br />The ending is surprisingly, and may be a little out of Greens usual style, though it makes you think about the values of your live, the values of your friendships.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-06-30

This change their lives dramaticaly, and takes away most of the beauty. Their daughter can hear, and becomes the link for Janice and Abel to the world of hearers, a world they don't understand and don't trust.<br />This is the story about Janice and Abel who live in their own world. A world of signs. Signs they are ashamed to show.

The book is about how we can develope more self knowledge. We don't need to do dramatic changes, small steps in our everyday lives are more important.<br />Feelings are the essence of our lives, be honest, take the chance to learn about your own feelings, why they are like they are, how to show them more freely, not to hide them. Learn to live with your feelings, to be the person you are deep inside. We need and deserve love and respect from ourselves as an encouragement to keep on living the life we are meant to live.<br />The book is very informative, and I can hear Satir's voice through the pages. The topic is difficult to show in such a small book though. I have never met Virginia Satir, but I think that her ideas would be much more understandable if I had heard it from her, they become too flat, too two dimensional in a book.

And of course all we read is true, in the world of Roald Dahl. Every kid instinctively understand this and can inhabit the Dahl-world in seconds.<br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is about Mr. Fox and his fight for his family's life, to escape from the three farmers, Boggis and Bunce and Bean, one fat one short one lean. Our loyalty is set right in the beginning of the book, and then we can fight with Mr. Fox and his children through the pages. Mr. Fox is always at least one step ahead of the three farmers, and his plans are so fantastic none of us have fantasy enough to come up with them ourselves, but when we read about the fox we say to ourselves, of course, it has to be like this, just like it was our own idea from the beginning.<br />No one can write fantastic stories like Roald Dahl. I am happy and thankful for all the books he manage to give us.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-06-05

In the car I always have an audiobook to listen to, and the last weeks I really have enjoyed Margareth Atwood's Bluebeard's Egg and other stories.<br />This is a collection of short stories written by a master of words, and a master of short stories. When Atwood writes she uses no extra words or sentences, she takes us right to the point, and the point in this collection is human beings. Common human beings fighting for their lives. No heros, just plain people like you and me. Every time a new story starts I think, this one cannot be better than the last, but it happend again and again, the story captivates me, and it is all mornings hard to stop the car and go to work - I want to hear just one more sentence, and then one more.<br />My favorite story though is the one that has given name to the collection, Bluebeard's Egg. A well known fairy tale, told and given it's own meaning by Atwood, or may be she just shows us the original meaning of the story. Sally, the main carachter of the story struggles with the puzzle of her life, to keep all the pieces together. The center of her life is her husband Ed, but how can she be sure that she is also the center in Ed's life? No one can write about this, invite us into and let us be in the feeling of the story like Atwood do.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-06-03

I read Girl With a Pearl Earring last year, and it became my book of the year. It was therefor with great anticipation I bought this book, another book from Tracy Chevalier had to be another winner.<br />Falling Angels is from the time period the years following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. Two families meet at a cemetery, and this meeting has great influence on both families' lives. The story is told through several voices, all the members of the families, but also people around them. All the time we follow the same story though, the life of these two families, and how they react upon changes in society. <br />Girl With a Pearl Earring is told through one girl only, and in the beginning I had problems with all the voices in this book. But as the story went on this became the perfect way to enlighten the points the book wanted to enlighten. The gravedigger boy had one story to tell, the girls of the two families other stories, still it is all woven into a whole, using a rich mixture of colors.<br />I love Chevalier's way of writing. What made me give this book a four star instead of a five was the development of the story. The firts half of the book built up a family story, quite interesting in itselves, but then when the book became more and more a book about the suffragettes it lacked connection with the first part. All in all the book has some very good points though, and as several other reviewers have pointed out, the last hundred pages has alot of surprises.<br />I look forward to the next book bu Tracy Chevalier.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-06-02

She is a doctor, which for her proves that she is doing good. She is married to David, who is not good, and they have two quite normal kids.<BR>Katies life changes the day she finds herself calling home from a car park telling her husband that she wants a divorce.<br />This makes both Katie and David look at their lives with new glasses. And suddenly Katie finds she is married not to the angry, cynical, negative David, but to the David who is good, doing good deeds whenever he can, even giving away the kids' toys, the family meals, their spare bedroom.<br />The plot in the story focuses on our ethical values. And the way this is done gives me mixed feelings. The values Hornby tries to point out as the positive and important ones (at least that's what I think he means) is the values of my life. I try to be good, I try to spend less to have more to give, I try to give of my time to people, I go to church. But the way Hornby writes about all this makes it look silly and somehow ironical. The book makes me feel bad, like Katie feels bad when she tries to look back on the life she has been living. And at the same time I feel that Hornby makes fun of me, and of people like me.<br />Having said this I also want to say that this is an important book. It is a book people should read, not as an easy, leisure time book, but as a book giving help for the reflections about our lives. What is it to be good, what is it not to be good. And at the same time the book is funny, really funny. I have laughed alot reading about the predictable lives of Katie and David.<br />This will not be my new bible, but I know that this book will live with me for some time. And may be even make some changes in my life for myself and for other people.	2002-05-27

She is a mother and a grandmother, and has a long and meaningful life to look back on. Now she feels all the signs of age, and her hands and fingers that used to do all kinds of useful crafts are now arthritic. Still they have their own, very special beauty, like Mary has in herself. People can see the beauty in this old woman, and not only family, but people of all ages comes to see her. And Mary has the skill to see the beauty in them all.<br />Mary looks at her fingers, and can still see that God has something useful waiting for them. She knows that there is still something life wants her to do. She then starts to make the QUILT together with all the people coming to see her. But this is not an ordinary quilt. Every singel stich is made with a prayer. And as the stiching goes on, the life of the people we meet starts to change.<br />This is a moving book, written in a beautiful way. The book teach us something important of life. In a time when we are all so busy, we never have time to sit down together, not to mention sit down in silence and in prayer. No one who gets involved with Mary's quilting project will be the same again. No one who gets involved in this book will be the same again.

What a wonderful surprise. Charlotte Lyons has made several craft books on different topics. This one is about projects you can share with friends. What about starting a craft group with some good friends or giving away a small hand made gift when you go for a visit or enclosing some fabric in a letter for a dear friend. The book gives alot of creative and great suggestions. <br />I have done all this, and still do. As a matter of fact, the friend who gave me the book and I have shared so many crafty projects over the years. There really are no limits in what you can do. And as it's said on the cover of the book - in an era when women set aside very little leisure time for themselves, let alone for their friends, Between Friends provides the perfect excuse to invite the girls over.<br />The great thing about this book is that Charlotte Lyons has collected so many different things you can do, and put them together in a charming and quite whimsical way. Don't start reading the book late in the night. You will never be able to go to bed then untill you have started a new project, phoned a friend to discuss some new yarn you saw in town earlier that day, or written a letter to a pinpal with pictures of some of your latest quilts.<br />The book will be a favorite of mine for years to come, and I know it will inspire me to make wonderful gifts for and with my friends from all over the world. And a little secret. MY Between Friends has a little handmade bookmark, embroidered with the words&quot;If friends were flowers, I'd pick you&quot; - made special for me by my special sharing friend.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-23

As a member of a friendship group working with a friendship link between Trondheim in Norway and Keren in Eritrea I have been interested in Eritrea and its people for a long time. I have been to Eritrea several times, and have also met some of the refugees, both refugees still in other countries and refugees that have returned home.<br />Gaim Kibreab is an Eritrean which has worked for the country and for Eastern Africa from abroad for many years. And he has a great knowledge on the country and the problems caused by the long conflict with Ethiopia.<br />Ready and Willing...but still Waiting, is the first in the Life &amp; Peace Institute's new Horn of Africa Research Reports.<br />The book is meant for people with special interest in the area and the topic. When the report was written still nearly 400 000 Eritrean refugees were living in Sudan, willing to go back to Eritrea. The report tries to explain why they still are waiting to go home.<br />Today the situation is different. Refugees are returning home, and Eritrea is doing its best to greet them welcome. This is not easyin a poor country, where the resourses are few, especially the problem of finding enough water for all, is a main task. Still Kibreab's book gives very good background information, and a very intereting read for anybody interested in the topic.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-22

When we travel together we always bring enough reading stuff, and our main book this time is Matilda - a fantastic book about a fantastic girl. I have read all of the Roald Dahl books for my kids several time, Matilda has always been and still is my favorite :-)<br />Matilda is a small girl with extraordinary talents. Already when she is three years old she starts visiting the local library and reads all the books there, starting with the children´s books, keeping on with the world classics. Matilda´s parents are very neglective, and refuse to see any of Matilda´s talents. But Matilda is a fighter and finds her own very creative and very funny ways to get revenge.<br />Matilda is a funny book, showing a girls fight for her individuality, in a typical RoaldDahlish way. I love it, and all my kids have loved it as well. My youngest daughter is only six, and should be a little too young for the book. But still the book works perfectly for her. The chapters are quite long, but none of us manage to stop after just one chapter. Being on holiday, we can sleep long in the mornings, and can read for a long time in the evenings.<br />An extra pluss with the book is all the fantastic recommandations of future books it gives us. Dahl has made a wonderful list of the books Matilda read at the library.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-20

She has a very special talent for music, and her music teacher from childhood becomes a very special person in her life. She teaches her to read the notes between the notes, the Grace Notes, and this gives special meaning to Catherine´s life and music. And also special meaning to the book. The book can be read as words within words, which makes the book full of grace notes.<br />What fascinates me most with the book is the way Bernard MacLaverty shows us how to read or look at music just like we read or look at paintings. Having read several books about the stories behind Vermeers painting, MacLaverty also uses a Vermeer painting to show music.<br />I can fully agree with a the reviewer Tobias Hill from The Times: &quot;The strongest impression left by Grace Notes is that of its central image-og the 'notes between the notes' which seem to compose themselves - of a life happening while it´s heroine is busy making other plans...If architecture is frozen music, Grace Notes is the literary equivalnt, full of its own powerful rhythm.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-20

Jean Baptiste is born with no body scent of his own, but he has a special ability to smell all scents, and to pick out one scent from another. He will use this ability to make the perfect parfume, the smell of love itself, and on his way to master this art he has no hesitations.<br />The story is told through Jean Baptiste, and Patrick Süskind masters the art of the written word.

We moved last fall to a 25 years old house with a huge garden, and now we are looking for new inspirations everywhere.<br />Many of the garden books I find are from a climate much warmer than the one here in the middle of Norway, so reading about grapes, olive treas, huge flowering plants in huge terracotta pots only makes me dream about Italy France and Spain. But then I found the fantastic book about Scandinavian Gardens by Karl-Dietrich B&uuml;hler.<br />B&uuml;hler has travelled in the Scandinavian countries and is writing about special and remarcable gardens he has met on his travellings.<br />The book start with a story of a little boy, actually B&uuml;hler's own son, chasing wild gooses, and this reminds B&uuml;hler of Niels Holgerson's fantastic travels written by the Swedish Selma Lagerløf. And then B&uuml;hler takes us on a travel almost as fantastic as Niels Holgerson's one.<br />The gardens we meet through the book all has their own charm. Very often when you find a book trying to describe the best gardens, you are taken to the big, public ones, but in this book, together with some of the public garden we also visit some of the quite small, private gardens. We meet the owners and can read about their work of planning and maintaining the gardens.<br />The book has lots and lots of charming and outstanding pictures. A joy to own, a joy to have on a coffee table, or the garden table. Not as a decoration only, but as a book to look through and get inspiration from when you have washed your hands after hours of garden work.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-07

After having read and enjoyed Mrs. noah's Patchwork Quilt by Janet Bolton, it was a pleasure to find this similar book, My Grandmother's Patchwork Quilt.<br />The book tells an the story of a small girl living on a farm. The story is told in two ways though, in words, and also in the making of a patchwork quilt. Very charming. We are told the story through one girl, but the story is actually about her grandmother. She tells from her childhood and at the same time she pieces her life in patches. And the huge treat of all, in the book is a pocketful of patches so that you are able to make a story of your life quilt. <br />A perfect way to do a favorite activity with a favorite child, while you tell your own life story.<br />I can recommend this book for all booklovers and all quilters.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-02

Have read most of them over and over again for my own kids. It was a joy though to find a book about Roald Dahl and his family and life, seen through his kitchen. And the many parties he always gave.<br />Roald Dahl loved food, and in his middle class home in England he loved to gather family and friends around the huge dining room table. On the table there is always delicious food from around the world, also from Norway - the home country of Dahl's mother, the home country of myself.<br />The book is a perfect mixture of anecdotes from Roald Dahl's life and recipes from his kitchen, and all through it is filled with pictures and photos, both to illustrate the cooking and to illustrate the house and the kitchen. The book also has illustrations by Quentin Blake, the illustrator who has worked with Dahl on so many of his books. For me his drawings are perfectly &quot;Dahlish&quot;.<br />The recipes are all simple though quite chick :-) And following them you will have ideas for an uncountable numbers of parties ahead of you. <br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-05-01

Linnea in Monet's Garden is a book written by Christina Bjørk, and illustrated by Lene Anderson, both come from Sweden.<br />The book tells the story of Linnea, a small Swedish girl, and her old friend and neighbour, Mr. Bloom. Linnea and Mr. Bloom share a love for paintings and for flowers, and Claude Monet is a painter they both love. Together they decide to visit Paris, and Monet's garden in Giverny, and with the help of this book we can go with them on this journey.<br />The book is first of all a beautiful, everyday story about two friends visiting the house and garden of a beloved painter. But it is also a masterpiece in the way it is built up. The way the story, the information about the impressionist period in art, the pictures and paintings all melt together. I and my 6 years old daughter can never get tired of the book, and after reading it an uncountable number of times we both felt that we knew the garden in Giverny. It was a very special day for us then, last summer when we were able to visit Giverny, the house and the garden. We could walk around seeing the same sights as Linnea had seen, sit on the bench together with both Monet and Linnea, walk over the Japanese bridge, and take pictures of all the flowers Linnea had also photographed.<br />Though this book is first of all a book for children it is a treasure for all ages. A pure joy to read over and over again.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-30

Though the name of this book is Galileo's Daughter, this book is mostly about Galileo himself, his life and his new and exeptional way of seeing the world. Alot of it is seen through the letters written to him by his daughter though. The book is a perfect example of a book about popular science written in a way to give the reader a full story about a man and his life. And his daughter.<br />Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is the father of the telescope. Galileos's thoughts were not at all welcomed in his world, and it is incredible to read about the way this man give his live for his work.<br />Many books have been written about Galileo, but this is the first time we meet his daughter, soer Maria Celeste. Unfortunately Galileos letters to his daughter have not been saved. But Maria Celeste's letters are a treasure, showing an intelligent daughter supporting her father. Together with helping him with alot of practical thinghs, living for making the life comfortable for him, she also helps him with his work, among other things helps him in his writing of the masterpiece, Dialoges.<br />The book should have been more about Maria Celeste and her life. We are always in need for more books about women in the history. Maria Celeste died at the age of 33, after a life with too much work and too little sleep. Dava Sobel has done a good job in showing us glimpses of her life, the life of a woman who has had influence on the history, though deep in the shadows of the historical highlights. I want to pay tribute to Maria Celeste and all other women sharing her conditions.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-29

I had heard so many good things about Ian McEwan, and on top of it this book was a winner of the 1998 Booker Prize.<br />The book though did not meet any of my expectations. The book had a quite good start. A woman dies, and in her funeral two of her formal lovers meet. And Molly Lane's death makes them look upon their own life and vulnerability in a new way. How can they know how long they will live? How can they know that they will not get such a terribel decease as Molly Lane got? Better to die than take the risk. And they get a pact with each other to help each other to end their life if something happend.<br />This could have been a valuable book in the euthanasy debate, but instead the book is so flat, and McEwan manage to give no life to the carachters.<br />Also the name Amsterdam confuses me. It might have something to do with the liberal laws on euthanasy in the Netherlands. But we have to read to the very last pages of the book before Amsterdam gets any part at all.<br />The somewhat good and interesting part of the book, that made me give two instead of just one start, is the way Ian McEwan writes only half of the story, and the rest is up to the reader's imagination. You are bond to make up some of the story yourself, and a few places this works out.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-28

After having read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory together with my six year old daughter she absolutely wanted to hear more about Charlie and the fantastic factory he got from Willy Wonka.<br />The Great Glass Elevator can not be compared to the first book though, and is probably written for kids much older than my daughter. The plot is too difficult to understand, and especially all the talk about the American president and his advisers does not make any sense - at least not for a kid.<br />We still meet the same Willy Wonka though, the charming, totally crazy man and all his mad ideas. So inspite of the difficult plot part of the book is quite good. My daughter especially liked the part where the grandparents are given the Wonka-Vite pills that will make them 20 years younger, and the fight between the olds to get most pills. But it is dissappointing that such a small part of the book is spent in the chocoalte factory. At least for young kids a sweet factory is much more a place of their dreams than flying around in outer space in a glass elevator.<br />Not among Dahl's best book, but still a good read, especially to read together with a book loving child.	2002-04-23

And in the book Mayes open the door to her new home and her new country for us, inviting us in. And I never say no to her invitations.<br />For me this is a book that takes me to the dreams I have deep inside myself, bying a house in Italy and live the sweet life there, cooking, gardening, cappuccinoing.... you name it. I think we all have a dream of our own &quot;Tuscany&quot; deep inside, and Frances Mayes shows with her creative writing that this dream might come true one day for all of us. I and my family have a cabin here in Norway, at the coast, where we love to spend our vacations and our free week-ends. And my favorite past time there is reading once again Frances Mayes book about Tuscany. Her books has given me a totally new meaning of owning another home, a home where we can go and live out our dreams, the dreams of a sweet live in contact with nature.<BR>I know I will read the book again and again, and it has also inspired me to do my own writing, from my life under the Norwegian sun.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-19

As a girl I loved to help my mum, and then when I married and got four kids there were always someone to cook and bake for. And there still is.<br />Living in Norway I am used to make most of the food from scratch, and to bake most of the bread and cakes we eat. I also have inherited alot of recipes from my mother, my grandmothers, and (some of the best ones) from my father-in-law.<br />Of course I thought I knew everything there was to know about making tasty food in my kitchen:-) Then my husband got The Naked Chef for Christmas. I had seen a few of Jamie Olivers television programs and was interested in the book. And after having read a few pages I was hooked.<br />Jamie Oliver has a very simple, fresh way to cook. There is nothing difficult, no dishes with too much preparations (at least he tells us so). Still the food he is making is so good, so tasty, and looks so elegant. Take his bread recipes for instance. He starts with the same ingredients for all his different sorts of bread, then, &quot;simsalabim&quot;, he does a little trick, and you have a totally different bread.<br />I celebrated my birthday as an Italian party the other night, and his Focaccias and Ciabattas are the most delicious ones I have tasted (exept from the fresh ones bought in Iatky of course).<br />I still have alot to try from his book, and look forward to great hours in my kitchen, in Jamie's company.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-17

Having read Niall Williams two other books, Four letters of Love, and The Fall of Light, I was really looking forward to this book. Still it was waiting a long time in my shelves untill I started it, and when I did it took me some time to get into.<br />Williams is a master of the written word. His language is strong, and captivates you in a way few other writers do. His books are about everlasting love, and of lost, though he never writes in a sentimentaly way. In As It Is In Heaven we meet Philip Griffin and his son Stephen. The two of them are alone in the world after the tragical death of Philip's wife and young daughter. The death of these two dominates the life of the two men and the whole book. All Philip has to live for is his son, and the knowledge that when he has done what he has to do for his son, he will meet his wife again in heaven.<br />The way Williams write about love underline the believe I have in love. Love is strong, love can live through everything, love can do everything. And for Philip Griffin life and love is like this. And this is also what his son learns. Love is everything. Stephen grows up with the shadows of his past over his life, when he meets Gabriella Castoldi, the Italian musician who change Stephens life for ever. We now follow Stephen, the man who can give nothing less than his whole life, and Gabriella, the woman who doesn't know to live with this \\"whole life\\" Stephen is offering her. This is the strong theme in the book, but this is at the same time what makes it hard for me to believe in the book. Stephen is giving so much, how can a man really act like this? And at the same time, Gabriella seems uncapable of recieving all this love.<br />Williams style of writing is poetic, and ge goes deep into what he writes about. Though this is not his best book he is still one of my favorite writers of today. I look forward to more from his pen.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-15

Travelled there with a backpack filled with travel books and novels about Rome. I do travel alot, and usually the Lonely Planet guides have been very helpful. But this one was not. At least not helpful to take with me when I walked around. The book has alot of information, but it is hard to find the information when you need it, the text is usually quite boring, the maps are of very little use, and the book all in all looks dull.<BR>There is one exeption though, the boxed texts can sometimes be very useful and even written with some charm. The first day I was in Rome LP's Rome followed me in my backpack, but in the evening I took it out - it was of no use when I wandered around, and I had several books so much more interesting and helpful.<br />I really hope the next edition of the book will be better, knowing other LP books I will give it another chance.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-15

Dahls books, loved by some, hated by some, are truly amazing. You never know what will happend, though you can be truly safe, nothing too bad will happend to you as long as you behave.<br />Chalie is a little boy living in deep poverty with his parents and his four grandparents. A tuff world for a little boy, and no romantification by Dahl, but still you almost want that you were little Chalie. His life, though filled with poverty and hunger is also filled with love. He is surrounded by love by the six grown ups in his life. When the chocolate king Willy Wonka is going to give away 5 golden tickets which will give you access to his adventurous factory, Charlie knows that there is no chance that he will win a ticket. Or may be there is a chance? Charlie's birthday is just around the corner, and every year Charlies parents and grandparents collect all their leftover money to buy little Charlie one tiny piece of chocolat. And of course, this plate, just as any other plate can be one of the five with golden a golden ticket.<br />As the story goes on we meet the four first winners of the golden tickets, all children like little Charlie, but of course none of them anything like Charlie. Dahl let us meet four nasty children, though described with great humour.<br />Of course Charlie gets a golden ticket in the end, if not, there would be no book about Charlie and the chocolate factory. And he and his \\"old as Methusa\\"-grandfather Joe are invited to the factory with the four other kids and their parents.<br />Now we are taken into a world so filled with fantasy it is like a wonderful dream for every child.<br />Roald Dahls writing is perfect for any child between 5 and 105. You are never too old to enjoy his books.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-04-06

And among my favorite children's books are the counting books. Then again, among the counting books Anne Geddes' 123 is really a winner.<br />Anne Geddes' photographies are the cutest. Let's start with the front cover, Three small baby bunnies in a pink basket. And Anne Geddes' bunnies, like all the other figures in the book, are real babies. And cute as buttons all of them. The same three baby bunnies are also hiding among the numbers 123 on the front cover. <br />The book has one page for every number, one pumpkin, two cabbages, three clowns and so on, all the way through the book.<br />The pictures are so perfectly done, Anne Geddes really masters this art.

Lucy Sullivan is getting married, at least the fortune teller she visits with her friends says so. Of course Lucy Sullivan does not believe in fortune tellers or in tarot cards, but when things the fortune teller told would happend to her friends really happends she starts to wonder. Is she really getting married? She, who never has any luck with the right men? And whom is her husband to be? Can it be Gus, the gorgeous, sexy though unrelyable Gus, or may be Jed, the new boy at work, or may be Chuck, the handsome American she is dating? Well, it really isn't Daniel though, he is her best friend and the one who listens to her when she makes a mess of her life. Which she does, over and over again.<br />Lucy Sullivan has alot in common with Bridget Jones. They are both singel girls trying desperate to make the best out of their lives, to be sexy enough, thin enough, have enough money till the next payday and so on, and so on. Though this is not written as a diary like BJ is.<br />The book is a long one, more than 700 pages, but it is truly a page turner. And though Marian Kayes could with success have spend a couple of hundred pages less on the book, it is an easy read. You can laugh with Lucy, though you can't cry much with her. The language is too funny, though sometimes I really wanted to cry. Especially when she is having her useless meetings with her mother, or when she is trying to take care of her father after her mother has left him.<br />Marian Keyes is one of many promising Irish writers of today, and since this is the first book I read by her I know I have hours and hours of great reading time ahead of me. I'm already on my way to by another book by her, though untill it's done I can enjoy myself with another Irish writer, Niall Williams.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-03-18

I have travelled several times to Eritrea though, and have been searching for guide books from the country. When I went to Eritrea last fall it was with great pleasure I bought the LP book by Frances Linzee Gordon, Ethiopia, Eritrea &amp; Djibouti.<br />The book is one of the best LP books I've read. The writing is clearly, and it gives us good insight in history, facts, geography, and so on. I have read parts of the book about all three countries, but the Eritrean part is the only one I have actuallu used when travelling.<br />The books has some very good pictures and maps, and give alot of up to date information. My favorite part is the part about Asmara's architecture, &quot;Asmara, or Piccola Roma, soon came to epitomise the new philosophy: it was not just beautiful, but was well planned, well built and, above all, functiomal. The book is a good guide to use when you plan your travel ahead, and is even better when you actually are there and need or want information.<br />An extra benefit of the book is the small notes you find alot of, giving interesting information. Reading these notes makes your travel alot more special.<br />When I travel I use my guidebooks as kind of diaries. I write down restaurants I visit, hotel I stay at, interesting places I see and so on. And this book is filled with my writings almost on all pages. Gordon has seen it all, and gives very useful information about a very interesting, though little known country.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-03-15

Through the eyes of three people close to Master Georgie, Myrtle, a girl believed to be Georgie's sister, Dr. Potter, a geologist and Pompey Jones, the photography assistant, we follow him from Liverpool to the battlefield of the Crimean War.<br />This way to write about a person and his happenings is well known through Ian Pears An Instance of the Fingerpost. And can be a perfect way to keep the readers interest and also the readers capability to live with the story. But Beryl Bainbridge do not master this art in this book. The language is too flat, without feelings, and the plots are sometimes too cryptical to be understood. I had to read several parts more than once to be able to understand what it all really was about, and to understand which lenses where used.<br />Still the book has some good parts, among them are the battlefield scenes. And I also like the way Bainbridge use the meaning of the photography, to let us see snapshots of Master Georgie's life, using other people as lenses, as cameras.<br />The book is a short one, less than 200 pages, and the surprising ending helps to give meaning to the story.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-03-14

The king is married to the young English girl, queen Caroline Mathilde. She was married to the king to give him a son, and as the king had spent one night with her, out of massive pressure, she had born him a heir.<br />Struensee saw his chance to get power, and he took it. And in a few months he issued more than 600 decrees in the name of the king. A paper revolution took place from Struensee's desk. Through this time, which is called the start of the Enlightenment in Denmark, and in Europe as well, Struensee is doing the fatal mistake of falling in love with the young queen. The king knows what is going on, but in his narrow mind he loves both Struensee and the queen and has nothing against what is going on between them. Other people has though, and Struensee's future is sealed. We know already from the first page in the book that Struensee's &quot;mistake&quot; will be fatal for him, and he is to be killed by the end of the book.<br />Though knowing the end, Enquist manage to hold our interest through the whole book. We get angry with Struensee, we cry with Caroline Mathilde, and we feel pity for the king, unable to rule his country.<br />The books is a masterpiece in the way it tells part of the Danish history, and also part of the Royal history of Europe. Through the little girl Struensee and Caroline Mathilde get together they can be said to be father and mother of most of the European monarchy of today.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-03-06

But Ronia, the Robber's Daughter is among the best ones.<br />Ronia is born among a clan of robbers, and grows up surronded by love. But as she grows up she will discover that her small world is threatened from the outside. We are taken into a tale of strong friendship and love, a world where you are strong only because people love you, and you love other people. This is not a sweet love story, but a story where every child and grown up can learn important things about life. About forgiveness. About fright. And most of all about love.<br />Ronia, and her friend Birk are strong children. But at the same time they can cry and they can show their weakness. Lindgren is a master in showing the whole specter of human feelings. And it is very easy to believe in her characters, believe that they are real, cause they show real human feelings.<br />Many children must go through hard times, and feelings can be almost impossible to talk about. Lindgren's books are of great help. And best and most important of all, Ronia is a book about love, love as the strongest feeling. With love you can overcome.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-03-05

The book took me from the first page, following Francis Foley and his four son's in their search for Emer, Francis' wife, and also their search for life.<br />We follow the family to several continents, from Ireland to south Europe, to Africa and to America. But above all the book is a story about love. Eternal love. The love between two people, and the love inside a family.<br />When we meet Francis and his four sons they have lost their home, but what is more fatal, they have lost the beautiful Emer, the wife of Francis, the mother of Tomas, Finbar, Finan and Teige. We follow all these people, through Ireland, through love and loss, through fatal incidents. Through a scattered life, where each has his own road, and his own future to walk.<br />This is a book for laughter and tears, a book that captures you totally. A book to teach you about love, and how you spend your life. A book hard to put down, and a book that will live with you for a long time. A strong book, a marvellous book. And I can make Guardian's words mine - Williams really does write like an angel.	2002-03-04

It really took some time to get into the story, but once I was there it was hard to put down.<br />The Blind Assassin is the story of two sisters and the way their life turns out. It is told by the older sister Iris, written by her late in her life, looking back at her life when she was a young girl, through her growing up and through her life as a married woman. There are three lines, or threads on the story, paper clippings, \\"The Blind Assassin - a sic-fi book said to be written by her sister who took her own life when she was young, and then the story of Iris's life. All three threads sewn together. It was at first hard to keep the stories away from each other, but the more I read the more Atwoods way of writing took me. And the more I saw the masterly way she blended the stories together. <br />For me this is a very sad book. About a lonely woman who looks back at her life, a life she has wasted in so many ways. A weak woman apparently, but when you read between the lines you can also easily see her strength. Still it makes me so sad and so angry the way she was unable to do something about her life when she was actually living it.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-02-24

Each person has, I believe, some talent which is unfulfilled in some hidden area of his being - a talent which could be expressed and developed.<br />Jesus tells us in the Bible to use our talents, and Hidden Art gives us some great help on this road. I remember when I read it the first time my favorite part was where the writers tells us about taking small children to long services and how to help them to stay concentrate and listen to what the preacher preach. I was not a mother myself then, but I was a Sunday school teacher, and all the children in my Sunday scholl became familiar with the drawings I had learned from Edith Shaeffer.<br />Other areas the writes tells about are music, painting, interiior decorating, gardening, creative recreation - to name a few.<br />I'm rereading this book now after more than 20 years. It is lent, and for me lent is a period where I try to find time to be more quiet and live closer to God and the meaning he has for my life. There are many books helping me to walk this road, and Hidden Art is a wonderful book sent from the Almighty God.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-02-22

And I have been to some more and can tell about my travelling. The book Letters from Felix is more than a book actually. It also contains all the letters sent home by Felix, so we can open them and read them - over and over again. And it also contains small souvenirs from the places Felix visited.<br />Lately I have heard about a little doll named Flat Stanley. He, like Felix, travels around the world, actually he spent Christmas with us here in Norway, and with our relatives on Iceland this winter.

Another masterpiece by the Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho.<BR>This book, which is the third in the trilogy And on the Seventh Day (the first two are By the River Piedra I sat down and Wept, and Veronica Decides to Die) stands perfectly alone as well. The book tells the eternal story about good and evil. And the free will we all have to choose between the two of them. As Coelho says in the author's note: \\"When we last expect it, life sets us a challenge to test our courage and willingness to change; at such a moment, there is no point in pretending that nothing has happend or in saying that we are not yet ready\\"<br />One day the people of the village Viscos are visited by the devil. Old Berta sees him when he comes, as she has been sitting outside her house waiting for him for years. The devil, in the figure of a stranger comes to look for proof that the evil exists and is the strongest, and the village of Viscos is to be the arena for this remarcably struggle. The bargirl, miss Prym meets the stranger and sees the devil, and the fight for herself and for all human has begun.<br />Coelho writes in a masterly way, somewhere between reality and ficition, and his fiction is easy to belive as reality, or may be it is no ficyon at all.<br />The fight between good and evil are everywhere, in myself, as it is between USA and Afghanistan. This book has something important to teach us all, and should be read by all humans who wants to be aware of the fight going on. <br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-02-11

His task is to become the next \\"Giver\\" in this perfect society.<BR>Through his meeting with the old Giver Jonas discovers that his world is breaking up into peaces. His life gets a new dimension, or actually several dimension, and he is given the choice to save his world.<BR>All young adults should read this book, to learn that their life is important and that what they do, the way they live can make a change. To the better or to the worse. But as individual human beings we all have the possibility, and the human right to choose our path. And the way we live is not only ours. We live in a world together with the rest of the creation, and the way we live make us responsible for the rest of the world.<br />I gave the book a four, due to the ending.

Out Marta is the forth one, and at age 6 she still loves to cuddle up with a smile on her face listening to the story of Babar. The very sad part for a six year old is the beginning where Babar's mother dies and Babar runs away. But Babar is lucky and meets an old lady who takes care of him. And the joy is always big in the end when Babar meets his childhood friends and cousins again in the end of the books. And even becomes a king and marries his cousin Celeste.<BR>The book was written in 1939, but is still well worth reading for any child, and should be part of every lucky child's book collection. It will still be read again and again here in Norway, though the pages in the copy we have almost fall apart now (they can always be glued together again though)<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-01-28

We read aloud every day here in our house, and letter books have been favorites for years and years when the kids start learning to read. We live in Norway and speak Norwegian, so most of our children's books are also in Norwegian. Still, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is among the favorites. The text, by Bill Martin Jr. and John Archambault is so simple and still so filled with rhymes and humour. And Lois Ehlart's colorful illustrations go perfect with the words.<br />Learning the letters and learning to read can be a hard task for a child, and the book captures this perfectly. The letters live their own lives, climbing up the coconut tree, falling down again, bending, looping, having fun.......exactly what letters do when you are a newbie and try to sort them out. Any child will laugh of the way the letters act, and the sometimes hard task of learning the letters will be a wonderful game the child wants to play over and over again<br />We love this book in our house, and can recommens it to any young readers.<br />Britt Arnhild in Norway	2002-01-26

Our oldest daughter was then in the perfect age for the Madeline books (and dolls) We bought Madeline, and have since then read it over and over again. Now our youngest daughter is 6, and it's her turn to be in the perfect Madeline age.<br />Madeline is a little girl living in Paris with 11 other small girls, and their teacher Miss Clavel. Madeline is a charming little girl, and see to it that life in the small school is never boring. The story is told on rhymes in a perfectly charming way. You should think that the story might be a little hard to follow for the reader/listener, but the contrary is the truth. Just as it is a cute, charming story it is a great way of introducing rhymes to your children.<br />Of course, the most funny part is when Madeline is in hospital because of her appendix and all the other 11 girls also want to woke up in the middle of the night, to be taken to the hospital to have a scar on their stomach. It is lovely reading :-)<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-01-26

The book tells the story of the twins Rahel and Estha. They are two egged, but share mind, and their separation in their childhood is fatal for their lives. The book also tells the story of their divorced mother, their sad uncle, their grandmother and their dominant grand aunt. <BR>The story is a mixed tale of love and beautiy, and of loss and sadness. Roy's writing made me so angry I almost cried, but also some places I had to smile and laugh with the caracthers. Sometimes it was very hard to follow the story, as Roy jumps from past to present and back again without any pattern. Therefore I gave the book a three star, but I really had a hard time deciding if it should get only a two star, or may be a four or five.<BR>This is Roy's first book, and it got the Booker Prize of 1997.

The story is about the gardener Percy and all his animal friends. Percy and his friends are living a happy life in the park, the home of all his friends. They are joking together and playing each other tricks, always with a happy ending.<br />In this book Percy is cutting the trees in the maze, the secret path, and the animals are hiding in the middle to give him a surprice when he comes. The squirrel is not with the others though, but is busy helping Percy, though both Percy and the squirrel are both in their own thoughts. Persy is not listening when the squirrel talks, though he answers him alright, and the squirrel is not listening when Percy explains something - and they all have to pay for that in the end. Any child will love this, and be remined of all similar episodes on their own life :-) A great way to start a conversation between mother or father and child :-)<br />The book had wonderful, funny drawings, and the very best is the huge maze in the end, where you can fold out the paper and find your way through the maze.<br />Read the book with your child, and you will both have a nice storybook time.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2002-01-14

Quilting has for the past 20+ years been one of my passions. When I started quilting here in Norway around 1980 there were very few quilters around. And I started in the most simple way, cutting fabrics and piecing it together.<BR>During the years quiltbooks came on the market, and it was always interesting to see new techniques.<br />Then, I think it was in 1993 Nancy J. Martin came to Norway to give quilt classes. I spent a week-end with her and learned so many new things, a whole new world opened for me.<br />Nancy J. Martin has written more than 25 books on quiltmaking, and she is the founder and president og That Patchwork Place Inc, the publisher of America's Best-Loved Quilt Books.

I cannot imagine a luckier combination.&quot;<br />The words are from Paul Theroux's book The Great Railway Bazaar, where he takes us on a train journey through Asia. The book has excotic chapters, starting with The 15.30 - London to Paris, taking us via The Direct - Orient Express, The Night Mail to Meshed, The Golden Arrow to Kuala Lumpus, The Trans - Siberian Express and so on.  Names and places I dream of, and would like to go to - one day.<BR>Paul Theroux has been there, and he has been there with an open mind and his pen and paper to take care of this world of memory and language.<br />This is fun reading. Some people call Theroux a rasist, but I don't agree. Theroux travels with an open mind and really see people and places where he goes. The way he shares his experiences with his readers is so rich and funny, you almost can feel the smell of the meal of old onions wrapped in a dirty piece of newspaper his travel companion is having, or you feel the dust in your eyes from the dry countryside you are passing.<br />I bought this book at an European airport when I was out travelling, and has read it as a &quot;travel&quot;-book, reading on planes, railways, busses, in cars and so on. And my eyes have been opened to see the people around me - not as grey everyday fellow travellers, but as all different human beings. And from Paul Theroux I have learned that strangers are not actually strangers, but people who can show me more of a mixed world when I take the time to start sharing part of my life with them.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland.	2002-01-07

We read the Norwegian version of the book, as my daughter doesn't understand English, but the stories are the same, and the charming illustrations are by Ilon Wikland in our book as well.<br />This is such wonderful, old fashioned stories, from a time when the most important task of a little girl was to play with her friends, and the greatest worry was where to find the eggs of the old hen. It is so important in our world today that children can dream themselves into the life like it is in the Noisy Village, where everybody knows each other, everybody are friends, and they live a common day to day life. We love the chapters, and my daughter can never have enough of the stories.<br />The book reminds me in a way of Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books, though this story is set in Sweden, and shows us the traditional life of the Swedish countryside from the middle of the last century.<br />I can recommend this book for parents and grandparents that are looking for a charming read for their kids.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland in Norway	2002-01-06

Gift of a Letter was recommened to me by a couple of online friends. I have been a letter writer all my life, and couldn't resist buying the book. And my, I'm so glad I did. The book is such a pleasure to read, from start to end, about the pure joy of writing and recieving letters.<BR>I took the book with me on one of my business travels, started to read it on the plane, could hardly put it down during the meetings I had to attend to, and read again at the hotel. The first thing I did next morning was to find a stationary shop where I could buy paper, envelopes, cards, new pens and so on, then (after more meetings) I sat down in the nearest coffeeshop to write letters.<br />The art of letter writing is almost forgotten today, it seems so much easier to make a call, or write an SMS or an e-mail. But nothing can be compared to the joy and pleasue of finding a real letter in your mail box.<br />For Alexandra Stoddard letterwriting is not just letters to your mother when you are away, letters to your boyfriend or letters to oversea friends. What about a thank you letter to a good friend after a nice party, or a letter to an old teacher, or an old friend. The book has given me so many new ideas of whom to write, and what to write about. The only negative thing I can think of is that the book talks about letters as something you can write in a few minutes, so lack of time is no excuse. This is only partly true. For me letters are also the letters you spend hours to write, hours because there are so many things to tell a close friend, hours because you just want to spend of your time with your penpal.<br />Though I have been an avid letter writer since I was a little girl, this book has opened up a new world for me when it comes to.....yes, you're right ....letter writing. I have to book on my desk and know I will read it again and again, and I will write letters as long as my hands and my eyes allow me. And I will keep on writing letters every day, spending all my extra money on stamps.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2001-12-27

I never get as many as I am hoping for, so after Christmas a visit to the bookstores in my Norwegian hometown is a must. And this year will be as all others, though this year is also a little special. A good friend gave me Anne Fadiman's Ex Libris, and reading this book gives me a double reason to browse the bookstores the coming week.<BR>The book contains 18 essays about book loving, and is written by a person with a deep love of books. If you don't love books before reading this book ,I'm sure after reading it you will follow me on my book tour. The essays range from the story where Anne tells us how her book collection marries her husband's, it tells about different ways to treat books and she tells us about her origins, a family of book lovers.<br />I have always made dog ears in my books, and felt a little bad about it, how can I treat my beloved books this way, now suddenly I can see that I'm not alone, and still I can call myself a book lover. Books are to be used, the more the book shows it is used, the more it has been loved. In one of her essays Fadiman tells about Thomas Babington Macaulay and the way he reads books about the places he visits while he actually is there. Anne, you and Macaulay have another soulmate here in middle Norway. When I travel my suitcase is always so heavy I almost can't carry it. And what else in life can be compared to reading Johanny Spyri's Heidi for your daughters when actually visiting the town, reading Victor Hugo on a goat down the Seine, or The Road to Asmara, while sitting in a cafe in Asmara, the capitol of Eritrea. My Christmas reading this year contains (among others) of Kristin Lavransdatter by Sigrid Undset, and when visiting the Nidaros Cathedral this Christmas Day I had to bring a big purse to bring with me the book where Kristin visited this Christchurch of Nidaros.<br />We moved a couple of months ago. With a family of six it was wonderful to move to a bigger house, but there are fewer bookshelves here (at least so far). I have a book collection of several thousand books, and have now, for some weeks tried to go through the collection to see which books I can give away - oh, a terrible job. Anne Fadiman has through Ex Libris showed me that I can keep all my books, and even buy more, there is only a question of enough shelves, or fantasy enough to find other places for your books. I will still give away books, I will not be without the pleasure I see in other people's faces when I show them my boxes with books to be given away, and they can take when they want. But I will also still buy books. I can't live without them, and I'm sure I have fantasy enough to find room for them.<br />Must end my review now, it is time to read a book or two for my fine year old daughter.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland, Norway	2001-12-26

I remember when I was 20 years old and discovered The Chronicles of Narnia for the first time. Now, 23 years later, I can look back at hours and hours of great fun. First reading the books myself, then reading them over and over for my four kids. A little later I discovered The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, but for about 20 years those were to only fantasy books I had read.<br />Then, three years ago the Harry Potter era started in our family. And now we live in a Harry Potter world here. But, in spite of all the pages a Harry Potter book doesn't last forever. It was with great pleasure that we some time ago opened my daughter's birthday gift and found the series The Worlds of Chrestomanci. They are perfect while waiting for the next Harry Potter to come, and perfect when you want something to read :-)<br />The first book in the series is Charmed life. It tells the story of Eric Chant, known as Cat, and his older sister Gwendolen. Cat and Gwendolen's parents dies in a boat accident, and all Cat have is his older sister. She is a witch, and Cat adores her. They first live with an old woman in the town, but it soon shows that Gwendolen has a very special talent for witchcraft, and to their joy they are asked for to come and live with the great Chrestomanci in his castle. Their life in his castle is not like the two kids expected, and Gwendolen, the witch, takes the easy way out and runs off to another world, Cat has to stay and fight his way through the days.<br />The novel is filled with fantasy and unexpected events. And it never let you get bored. The book is meant for young readers, and any booklover between 9-12 will love it. I even think any book lover between 9 and 99 will. Try the book, and you will be so charmed by it you just need the others in the series as well.<BR>Is it magic? Who knows......<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2001-09-18

There are 35 known paintings today, Girl In Hyacinth Blue is the 36th one, and fictive. In the book we follow it's history from today, and back through the ages and the paintings several owners till the time when the painting was painted.<br />A wonderful, fascinating story, written in the crisp and also dark Vermeer colors. Several stories are told inside the story, everyone better than the other. What if a painting really could tell it's story. How fascinating that would be. And Susan Vreeland has done a masterpiece in this book. A painting will never be the same, from now on I will look at every new painting with the glasses of history - what can this painting tell me, what has this painting seen.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2001-09-17

I have Nancy Brachey's Guide to Piedmont Gardening on my coffee table, and in the nights, after a day in my Nordic garden I love to look in it. <br />Piedmont is far, far from Mid-Norway where I live, and many of Nancy's suggestions will never work in my area. Other suggestions are perfect, and this shows me that gardening is a joy we can share world wide.<br />Nancy Brachey is the garden editor of The Charlotte Observer for 25 years. Though Nancy's area is a southern one, Nancy travels worldwide and has a very special eye for gardens - I believe the English and the Italian ones are her favorites. She picks up ideas on her travels and bring them back to Carolina for her neighbours to enjoy. The Guide book is a month-by-month guide stuffed with practical tips for big and small gardeners. Your garden can be a huge and unique one, or it can be just a tiny little spot right outside your kitchen door. Nancy has information for both, and invites us to join her in her love of gardening.<br />The book is filled with drawings and pictures. For a Norwegian like me I sometimes would love more color pictures to recognize the plants she is talking about, but her ton á ton green pictures have their very special charm.<br />I'm moving to a new house with a bigger garden these days, and Nancy's book will move with me and have it's natural place on my new coffee table. Thanks Nancy for sharing your love of gardening.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland	2001-09-16

She is the daughter of Jacob and the sister of his 12 sons from the book of Genesis. We only get a tiny little hint on Dinah in the Bibel story, here in the book we meet first a little girl, deeply loved and spoiled by her mothers, the four wives of Jacob, later she is growing up to be a strong woman, living in a remarkable period of early history.<BR>The Red Tent tells a story of bounds between women, strong women in a society where the most important is to be a man, a strong man. Anita Diamant tells us a story it is easy to believe in. It could all have happend this way. Her pen make this period of history glow, the storytelling is so rich and the people come alive even in our world of 2001.<BR>Thank you Anita Diamant for giving me this story, reading the first books in the Bibel will never be the same for me after this. You have helped me to start using my imagination to read the story behind the story.<BR>Britt Arnhild Lindland	2001-09-15

Some time ago we discovered If You Give a Mouse a Muffin, and both of us fell in love. It was with great pleasure we found out that Laura Joffe Numeroff and Felicia Bond has more books out in this series, and just like the first one, If You Give a Moose a Muffin has become an all time favorite for us.<br />The book starts with a little boy giving a muffin to the moose right outside his house. The moose gets the muffin, but comes into the house to get some jam to go with it.And of course the one muffin is not enough, the moose wants one more and one more.And as the story goes on the moose gets more and more fantastic ideases. The drawings that goes with the story are so funny, you just have to stop reading all the time to enjoy them.<BR>And exactly like the first book this story makes an eterniy wheel - in the end the moose see some jam, and of course wants a muffin to go with the jam, and we are right back to the beginning. It is a genious way to write for children, and just as much fun for the grown up reader.<br />My daughter and I only have the first two books in the series yet, but have the others on top of our wish list.<BR>Read the book, with or without a child, and I can promise you the best reading time :-)<br />My hope is that someone will translate these books into Norwegian, I would love to give all Norwegian chidren the pleasure of discovering them.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland in Norway	2001-09-14

My five year old daughter and I have our favorite time of the day every evening when I am taking her to bed. Then we read, read, read and read. Both picture books and chapter books.<BR>It is important to keep on reading picture books to the kids also when they outgrow the age of a toddler. There are so many great pictures and art in picture books that can help the children widening their horizont.<BR>With four kids in the house we have a huge collection of children's books, and among them some absolute favorites. And Elmer belongs to this group.<BR>Elmer the elephant is different from the other elephants in the jungle. While the others are ordinary grey he has patchwork colors, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green, black, white - what a wonderful way to repeat colors over and over for a little human being.<BR>But Elmer doesn't like to be different. He wants to be grey like the rest of the herd. Elmer finds a way to paint himself black, but to his, and to the young reader's surprise nobody recognizes him now when he is just as anybody else. Elmer is used to being seen, and has to do a trick to the others to be seen again. And the ending is in great honor to Elmer, the different one. And he has taught us a wonderful story about the importance of being the one you are meant to be, not to pretend being someone else.<BR>The story has given us great opportunities to talk about the importance of being the one we are. We are created unique and our strength is in keeping this uniqueness.<BR>The story has wonderful, simple paintings, bright colored. My five year old and I have alot of fun making an applique quilt of Elmer and his life. This book is a jewel either you have chidren or not.	2001-09-12

Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier is an historical fiction set in Holland in 1664.<BR>It tells the story of the painting by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The painting is a real one, and you can see it on the front cover of the book.<BR>Griet, the heroine of the book comes to the Vermeer house as a servant, and the book is written with Griet as the narrator. We follow Griet through her hard work for the Vermeer family, her first meeting with the father of the family and how he wants to paint her. Griet falls deeply in love with her master, and the book tells a beautiful though heartbreaking story of love and sacrifice. Griet is not only falling in love with her master, but also in his life of colors and paintings. Griet masters the art of mixing colors, and through her work together with Vermeer their relationship becomes very intimat.<BR>The clue of this story is the way it is told through Griet, and the way she manage to bring us with her to her 17th century world in Delft. I loved the book when I read it the first time, have reread it, and know I will read it again. It's a jewel of a novel, or on other words - a master painting. And it has made me interested in other books with the same theme, Dutch art and Dutch history.	2001-09-09

It was my best book of the year, and happily I could keep on reading Girl in Hyacinth Blue by Susan Vreeland. I loved both books, and when I saw Tulip Fever at my local book store I knew I had to buy it.<BR>Now, a few day later the book is read from cover to cover, and I have to leave the 17th century world of Amsterdam and all it's inhabitants, paintings, lust, love and intrigues to come back to today's Norway.<BR>Tulip Fever tells different stories, but they are all woven together through the main character Sophia. She is a young woman married to the old and prosperous Cornelis. He deeply loves his young and beautiful wife, and wants a painting to be made of them to take care of her beauty for ever. The painter, young and charming Jan Van Loos falls in love with Sophia, and as the portrait grows so does the passion between Jan and Sophia.<BR>This is a surprisingly story with more secrets and surprises as the chapters unfold.<BR>Every chapter starts with a famous sitat, and Deborah Moggach also uses sitats and famous people in the story. My favorite is when Cornelis and Sophia visits the painter to look at the finished portrait. Cornelis can't take his eyes from the beauty of his wife shown and says: &quot;You have certainly caught her beauty.....The bloom on her cheeks, her freshness and youth like the dew on a peach. Who was it - Karel van Mander? Who, on seeing a still life tried to reach into the canvas and pluck the fruit......not realizing that this particular peach was not to be eaten&quot;<BR>Jan has already picked the fruit in his painting, is she to be eaten? You will have to read the story yourself, and I can promise you that you will not regret it.	2001-09-08

Trevor, a 13 year old boy, gets an assignment in his social studies class - to come up with something that can change the world. Trevor gets the idea to ask people to pay forward when a favour is done to them, instead of paying back, and starts hinself by doing something really important for three people. The idea is remarkably good, but as far as Trevor can see nothing happens. He starts with a homeless man, giving him his pay from his paper route so he can buy himself some new clothes and get a job. When this apparently doesn't lead to any paying forward, Trevor helps the old woman next door doing her garden, and when she wants to pay him back all he asks for is that she shall pay it forward by helping three people. Unfortunately the woman dies, and Trevor again has to start from scratch. What he doesn't know is that things are already happening, and without Trevor's knowledge a really huge movement has started.<BR>Trevor, his mother Arlene and his teacher Reuben are people you get to know under their skin, even under Reuben's terrible scarred skin, and you laugh and cry with them througout the book. Being able to cry when you read a book is important, as feelings and the possibilities to show them are something valuable. And being able to take part in a year of Trevor's life gave me alot of opportunities to show tears, tears both of joy and of sorrows. Read this book with me, and let us together make the world a better place to live by paying it forward.	2001-09-02

Saw Tara Road on the shelves in my favorite book store here in Norway and it called out to me. Bought it, took it home and became an addicted Maeve Binchy fan. Since then I have read most of her books. Not many have been available here in my town in Norway, but I have bought some online and also found a couple at my local library. It was a big surprise though when I some time ago found a used copy of The Copper Bech at a local secondhand book store. <BR>I finished The Copper Beech today, after getting deeply involved in the characters in the book. <BR>The Copper Beech is set in Ireland like most of Binchy's books. Outside a small countryside school stands a copper beech, and once eight children carved their names in this tree. The children come from different backgrouds, what units them is the Shancarrig school where they all have spent an important part of their past. The book tells different stories, all about these kids and their life. It is a book about love and death, about daily life and about extraordinary events. Maeve Binchy is a master to tell a story the way you know it could have happend, her characters could me my neighbours, or yours for that. And at the same time she shows that there are extraordinary stories to be covered everywhere, in everybody's lives.<BR>Though this is not my favorite Maeve Bincy, so far Evening Class holds that possition, I love the book. It has it's place on the shelves in my growing collection of Maeve Binchy books, and passing the shelves glimpsing the books I know I have hours of cozy hours ahead of me if or rather when I want to read them over again. I'm glad I still have some unread Maeve Bincy books to look forward to, Scarlet Feather on top of that list.<BR>Happy reading	2001-09-01

In the first book about Agatha, AR and the Quiche of Death, Agatha was struggeling to find her place in the countryside village she moved to when leaving London. AR and the Vicious Vet is the second book about the colorful woman detective Agatha Raisin. Still not quite sure if the countryside is her cup of tea she feels more settled now, one of the reasons for that is her fliration with her distinguished neighbour, James Lacey. As always she is overdoing, and frightens her poor neighbour again and again. In this book the village has got a new vet, a handsome man in his fourties, and apparently he is living by his own. All the women suddenly are in need for a vet for their cats, and of course Agatha is among them. She is thrilled when the vet asks her out for dinner, and Mr. James Lacey is more confused than ever when Agatha starts passing his house without paying attension. Agatha has her date with Dr. Paul Bladen, but the next day the poor vet dies under suspicious circumstances. At least suspicious for Agatha - and to her great pleasure to Mr. James Lacey as well. Agatha throws herself in a whirlwind of happenings, and she lets us readers take part in them all. This book has been just as big a pleasue to read as the first one, and I know as soon Agatha starts making her cottage garden I will follow her out into my garden to make it just as beautiful as the one her good friend Bill Wong in the village police has.	2001-08-27

I live in Norway, and if I don't buy books through mail, there are not many English books available here. I had bought my share of amazon books for the month, and thought I had to pass this one. Then, while browsing one of the bookshops downtown I bumped into it, and decided to skip lunch a couple of days to buy it. Anyway, books are more important than food! Started the book almost at once, and got into it right away. The book tells the story of Ruth Young, and her mother LuLing Liu Young. LuLing Liu Young is in her eighties, and has started her fight agains Alzheimer disease. She came to USA from China as a young woman, and has lived almost all her grown up life in San Francisco. Her daughter Ruth also live in SF, with her lover and his two daughters. Ruth has a difficult relationship with her mother, and fails to understand her. But as LuLings disease gets worse Ruth decides to move in with her mother. This is also a good excuse for Ruth to have some distance to her live in man, trying to find out if their relationship is something they can save. And now alot of things from her childhood get it's explanation. Her mother has had her lifestory written down, and when Ruth gets help to translate this and reads the story, we are taken back to a China very far from the modern USA today. The story is told with annexation, humor and love, and Ruth manage to handle her own life now when she understand the past. This is a love story, love between mother and daughter.Love which is there in spite of all the difficulties such a close relationship give. And it is a story about a mother and a daughter discovering that they are bond together by bones, though their lives are very different. I'm very glad I found this book, and now, after reading my first Amy Tan novel I know that I will read more.	2001-08-26

It took me some time to finally buy some of the books, but one day a packet came from amazon with the three first ones. In the middle of buying and selling houses, full time work and a busy family it was not easy to sit down with the book. But you always need some resting time, and what is better then to crab a cup of ice tea, and sit out on the patio with a book. Agatha Raisin then came into my life, and here she will stay on, no doubth of that. I loved the book from the very first pages. First I was curious, this Agatha, who is she? Then amazed of this woman selling her promotion company in London to move out into the storybook English village, then I had to laugh, laugh alot ....She is for sure no Miss Marple, and no Penelope from Rosamunde Pilcher. She is truly something unique, a woman you have to love because she is so human, with her faults and everything. In her attempt to become one of the villagers, Agatha decides to take part in the country fair. No cook though she buys a quich from a London deli, quite sure that this one has to be a winner. Of course it is not, it is even a very bad quich, and when the judge eats from it he dies of poisoning. Well, from here the story goes on, with Agatha trying to find the murderer when eveybody else tend to believe it was just an accident. With this book I can promise you hours of fun, and if you are about to sell a house you might need to do as Agatha does, tell people the house is already sold when the come to look at it. I am glad I already have the second book to dive into, but what about my house selling???	2001-08-24
