Now, you may name lots of other books that did (or still do) the same, but every single one of them stood as a giant monolith versus rest of the literature.<br /><br />There is certain ammount of dark majesty in this book. Somehow, when one travels, one only gets to see those polished places made especially for toursit, those plastic feelings without passions that we grew accustomed to, and when someone smashes you with exactly that, passion, you must fall in wonder, or be forever silent and stunned.<br /><br />When it first camed out, it was received badly, by fellow artists and not-so-fellow critics. But waht is to expect from the work that spits into the center of the \\"old grandeur\\" of Austro-Hungarian monarchy. Dark Prater, place of whores and their customers, where cries of rage and lovemaking are silenced with slaps and knife cuts, so different from the shiny Prater by daylight, built and made for tourist which cannot see farther than spinning wheel. It is no surprise that darkness of Wienna portraied here made some people uneasy. Somehow, it is by far more easier to awert ones eyes and refuse to see anything, than face the challenge, risking sanity.<br /><br />Book that should be read, and studied....	2005-07-19

One of the hardest assigments of historical sciences (whether they are political, philosophical, or any other is beside the point) is assesment of twentieth century. Why is it so is more than obvious...Those books talk to readers who lived (or took part)at least in one part of the \\"history\\" they are trying to judge. And every reader out there has its own oppinion about it. Maybe the future is going to value those kind of exclamations smoewhat more, but that is for the future to judge.<br /><br />How can one explain both World Wars (espacially the secnod one), economic crises, rise and fall of communism and it satelite states in four hundred pages so that everyone should be satisfied, or even to put some rational argument behind it. Lots of Mazowers argumentation is based on the well known \\"This happened becouse of that\\" not allowing the slightest chance of interpreting history of twentieth century in some other way.<br /><br />There is certain kind of ecxellence in this book. Rise and fall of nation-states, capitalism, Americanisation, colonial policy, various skirmishes together with both world wars, all of them are putted together in well writen overwiev that is read easy and that is thought provoking in just right ammount... This is not a history book that speaks of leaders, battles, number of casualties, elections won and elections lostm this is a very good synthesis of European history, and good place for a starting point in more thorough examination of it.	2005-06-07

It was sometimes during my High-school period, and one of the classes we had to tend was philosophy. Our teacher told us which books is necessary for that course, and, of course, we bought it. Sooner or later I started browsing trough that book just to see what it is all about. And of course, the book was about history of philosophy. Though some of my teachers later in life had said that history of philosophy is the philosophy itself, I didn't care much for it back then. All I saw was endless ammount of years, names, places, events, various doctrines which all seemed alike to me, and maybe the most important thing was that book was so poorly written that boredom seeped from it's pages. (for that matter, nothing has changed even today, some of the historical textbooks and various representations still attained their ammount of painful boredom)<br /><br />I will not say: \\"Gee if I had this book back then\\" couse it wouldn't mean a thing. If you put aside the boredom of the textbook, philosophy itself intrigued me quite enoguh, but enough with me. This is the wonderfull book. I'll close on of my eyes and let some flaws in narrative construction pass me by, I will also put by me \\"simplistic\\" view of philosophy. All I want to see, and all you should see is the process that this book is trying to do. It is the process of thinking, having doubts, comparing among doctrines and finding the right path trough them, it teaches development of oneself as the only real way to be happy and succesfull in life. This book teaches one to ask that question that we are all afraid of \\"why?\\"<br /><br />In a world where children literature is nothing but simplistic, almost retarded approach to \\"teen\\" and children inteligence, this book stands high above any other.	2005-05-25

Well, it amazes me what I read on these pages, that this is the fourteenth book in the series, and thing what amazed me the most is the fact that I didn't stumbled upon any of them until now. Well, that just proves how out of the touch with this kind of writing I am, so you should take my review with some kind of a drawback. So, havign said that here goes nothing...<br /><br />I often read blurbs (though some would argue not often enough), and on this one (at least in my country) I have found some bleak comparison with Dickens. I often wondered, as I was reading the book, did the particular author ever read Dickens in his life. I'll guess that question will remain unanswered. But for you who read (hopefully) it, I don't need to tell you that there is not a trace of him here.<br /><br />Now, what we have is the top-notch detective who is having trouble with his superriours often enough to attract attention (as every top-notch detective should, sooner or later in his career), so that serves as a cover-up for his sending to a \\"rehabilitation facillity\\" where he meets others just like he's supposed to be. And while being there he has to unciver possible fraud amongst the certain police members. So, that covers up the basics. Of course, we have subplots. We have female character who is talking spotlight number two. And she is troubled by whole world of crime while feeling insecure about her role as a female in a male world of fightning crime. Sounds familiar? Wonder why...Yes, I shouldn't forget the rookie who is feeling left out from the game big boys (and girls) play, some sleazy detectivs and smart, and untouchable bad guys, who play their own game unconcerned by the police.<br /><br />Now, I don't know if this is becouse I arrived this late in the series, but all stated above doesen't hold water. At least not as much as it is necessary for this book to be something other than mediocre detective story.<br /><br />Only thing that brings up the atmosphere for a few degrees is the constant mention of popular bands of rock culture in time span of twenty-thirty years...though, I have the feeling it is just for the sake certain \\"coolnes\\" that is acquired trough that kind of articulation.<br /><br />My two cents...few degrees is the constant mention of popular bands of rock culture in time span of twenty-thirty years...though, I have the feeling it is just for the sake certain \\"coolnes\\" that is acquired trough that kind of articulation. <br /> <br />My two cents...	2005-05-16

One of them was Kert&eacute;sz. I was rahter sceptic about it, but that scepticism came from the lack of knowledge of Kert&eacute;sz's work. Up to that time I only read his short story that was, in my country, published together with Peter Esterhazy's, under the title \\"Same Story\\" which didn't impressed me much, at least not in the ammount necessary to confirm newspaper writings.<br /><br />Some time has passed and I finally got hold of Fateless, then Liquidation and now time came for Kaddish...Suffice it to say that with each reading of Fateless, my oppinion of Kert&eacute;sz as a writer and intellectual changed. And it only grew higher.<br /><br />Continuing his tetralogy which began with \\"Fateless\\" Kert&eacute;sz introduced a character (much of his own resemblance) of a writer/translator who, for the first time, tried to explain to his wife, why he cannot make himself to be part of the creation of another human being, and be responsible for bringing him into this world, giving him, automatically, so painful stigmata of Jewishness.<br /><br />You should be warned that there is no story line in this book, at least not in the manner of Fateless or Liquidation. Kert&eacute;sz wrote  Proustian kind of monolouge, almost stream of consciousnes which flows and flows as the lamentation goes by. But, since the times of Camus and his Siziphus there has been no greater existentialist work, though Kert&eacute;sz wouldn't call it like that. Questioning possibilites of existance, what of individual, what of the collective, Kert&eacute;sz has written major work of art, corresponding with poetry, philosophy, and sad fates of Holocaust survivors.<br /><br />Questions presented in this book are the questions of our generation, that should be answered before we should be allowed to venture further into field of rational understanding and emphatic social life.	2005-05-14

There is a certain melody, or better yet, absence of it, that speaks to the reader as he starts reading this book. You can't point out what exactly that melody is, but your senses tell you that it deffinitely has to be pesent somewhere. And as you focus yourself at those voices lost in the past, pictures start to flicker in front of your eyes, and you feel like you're sitting in a sofa, and your grandmother is showing you an old familiy album.<br /><br />You know what kind of albums are those. People you never met, on a murky background,  with twisted smiles and years that separate you. They may be your relatives, and you feel some sort of connection or obligation towards them, but essentialy, you couldn't care less about them.

But, that is just exactly what this book does.<br /><br />Amelie Nothomb doesen't need many characters, here she needed four. Retired proffesor of Greek and Latin and his wife, together with their neighbours make universe, with just right ammount of complexity that is necessary to build any kind of story. As often, in her work, one, almost banal thing, starts bizzare stream of events whic later result in a brutal, but quite propriate end.<br /><br />And where does it fail then? Well, try to read Hygiene of Murderrer (I don't know if this is the exact translation), or Antichrista and you'll notice that every one of her book follows the exact path. And reader has the feeling that he has seen it all before, and that everything became, from exploration of human conduct, just poor retelling of a same old tale, caused by the lack of poetic imaginnation.<br /><br />Maybe she presents strong arguments in certain aspects of her books, but she lack inventivness to become the great writer.<br /><br />It is just an average book, and if you read any of her work before, there really is no need to read this on too...Everything said here is just repetition...	2005-05-02

Then you make quick calcualtion, and then it stuns you. Twelve years. twelve years since book five (!?) and there is not an end anywhere close...Oh well, it seems that my grandchildren will countinue to read this saga, and they'll tell me all about it when I am blind and on my death bed....Oh well, better to say something about the book.<br /><br />What can you say? This is the book five and if you're not by now into this series, you should turn around and walk away, but if you, for some reason like it (or you are just masochistic as I am) this is same stuff as any before.<br /><br />It is, though, interesting, how everyone in the book, doesn't have a clue what they're doing, but they still insist on doing it, though still aware that their actions may shake the world in it's roots. Everyone goes around muttering their very own catchphrases that we learn to dislike, instead of maybe just being simpathetic with them in first book.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, short summary would be necessary here, just for you to know what you're missing and what you should expect (but I'm sure you can figure that out by yourself by now). Rand is leading Aiel, whose ways he still don't understand. Mat is trying to run away from them but still cannot. Egwene is doing nothing. Nynaeve and Elayne show remarkable ammount of idiotic behaviour, and that's about it.

Few days ago, waves of nostalgia swept over me and I picked the book from the shelf and re-read it...again...And, maybe for the first time, I realised how great this book really is.<br /><br />During those nine years, lot of stuff happened to me, and much of it involved some kind of travel, and living where I live, just thinking of travel makes whole adventure by itself. And suddenly, I found myself appreciating this book even more, and learning to look at some thing in it in quite different way than I did before.<br /><br />From great sattire, unforgetable characters (when you became old, you will have fond memories of Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford Prefect and even the Arthur Dent), twisted, almost insane logic, but with such feeling for humane and humanity that it makes you cry...tears just flowing from your eyes...whether from laughter, or saddness that Adams died and Hollywood will definitely ruin the movie.<br /><br />Maybe my thoughts would differ somewhat if I have read these books one by one, but editors at my country published them binded together and I always looked at them as a whole.<br /><br />If you miss this one, you'll miss the grandest, and weirdest adventure that ever existed.

What could possibly be new about dissfunctional family, loosing of a child, and psychothic women. Everything that had to be said has been sayed. Where is the difference?<br /><br />And then one starts to read. And then He understands.<br /><br />Loosing of a child, excentric painter as a father, brothers who are alienated and whose only bond is Kitty herself, obsessive behaviours, all of them stands for finding the identity. Another author has often wondered: \\"How do we become what we are?\\" and this book partly answers that question. In a world where nothing functions as it should, in a world were values have tvisted meanings, and trauma is almost a common thing how can one stand up, and develop onself in a way that society concieves as 'normal'.<br /><br />Surprisingly (at least for me) this isn't a book about position of women in a evil patriarhal world. This is a book about ordinary people and connections that makes them just that - people.<br /><br />Struggle for survival can take up many faces and this book presents maybe the most painful one.<br /><br />Ten chapters you should meditate over.	2005-04-23

Just before I receievd this book to write a review for a news site that I'm working on in my country, I was listening to David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust. While song was playing, I started reading. And somehow, something snapped in my mind, some fray thoughts connected, and everything sat in its place.<br /><br />This is the story about the young and talented student (how many times have you heard this), who is, or is going trough an identity crisis, failing to find herself in a compelling and misterious but mostly unfair world.<br /><br />Four short stories connected into a romanesque form speak of an impossibility to describe anyting with words or voice (story one), speak of a love lost and love found, of a way in which artists put themseles outside of the world (story two), speak of a hospital existance (story three) and finally, the longest and most upsetting one that speaks of identity lost, and identity found.<br /><br />So what's so special about it. Maybe the possible answer is the thing what I felt about it, it was almost like you can feel the pulse, you can feel the life itself imprisoned into a cage of paper, that is struggling to break free, to live and breath again without the boundaries of literature. It is almost that you can hear the scream coming from those pages: \\"Let me out!

Time is to say something about the book, and not only about the book.<br /><br />There is a question that every one of us would have to answer alone, nad he will ask himself the question when he suddenly becomes aware (or, as Morrie would put it: \\"As he starts to believe\\") that he is going to die. What kind of question it will be depends on many things, and answers vary in such ways that no two can ever be the same. But one thing that we'll sure wnat answer for is an answer to:\\" How have we lived our life?\\"<br /><br />There are much philosophical doctrines out there, and there are even more religions, and way of the world has never been harder to find, but yet, somehow, everything is connected. With what, you may ask, and answer would be love. It is not the twisted, perverse kind of love of modern authors, and modern world, it doesen't have to do anything with sex, or pleasure, it is just the pure love....caring for another being just for the sake of it being what it is. And, maybe, indeed that is all that we need for  happy, full life.<br /><br />This is sad book, and I did wept as I was reading it, and I think that there is no person in the world who haven't done the same, but it leaves us with a frail notion oh hope, that not everything is yet lost, and that we can make the world better, if we only stop, pause nad think. We are living furious life, an \\"urban\\" one as you might call it and it has it's ups and downs...Maybe we have to pause...to let the world rest for awhile while we compose ourselves, and start behaving in a certain different way....<br /><br />I'll put aside the litteral value here, it really is of no concern, you should put your mind on Morrie and his life, and what he is saying...and maybe, just maybe, we'll have some kind of beginning...	2005-04-19

And yet, we cannot get enough of it. Questions posed in those books poke at the mind with such fiercness that sheer struggle remains to hold on to ones sanity. It is the question of existance, of possibility of existance. And of the world that made that question possible.<br /><br />How can one live a life where even his birth was an anomaly, something that never should have happened, luck, coincidence, life in the camp of death where Arbeit mach frei...Can he exist as a writer, and is his personal legacy in a from of literature strong enough to revoke effects of concentrational camps. Kertesz say \\"no\\", and leaves an emptiness for every reader to fill out himself. Love and sex, marriage and relationships hold no meaning in Kertesz's world of pain, world of morbid and twisted humanity which is, sadly, world that we live in.<br /><br />What is a Jew, and what is the meaning of being Jew? Questions posed in a postmodern (yeay! everything is postmodern nowadays) way of author who had written a play that speaks of character of an author reading it...Yet, that is just a style practice...Final part of Kertesz's tetralogy doesen't close this chapter at all, it just prolongs a moment of necessary answer...A must read!	2005-04-08

We see a character with unknown (to us) but troubling past who is returning to his homeplace from Paris. And slowly, but steady, that character begins to tell us a story of Germany in a post war years, and we feel lulled and intrigued. Our main character is troubled by his association with notorious terorist organisastion but struggles to lead normal life.<br /><br />And that is how it begins.<br /><br />Suddenly we find ourselves looking to world with different eyes. Albish changed his narrator. And yet again. and again, almost the method we observed at Faulkner. Slowly we learned that Germany is troubled with the fact that concetrational camps even existed, and willingly and conciously is trying to bury that fact deep into nothingness. But then something unexpected happens (like discovering of a mass tomb) and everything becomes a blurr again.<br /><br />Albish putted his characters into a state of drowsiness, where they just walk by, and just \\"happen to be\\", and they are leading their small life, troubled by their own pettite troubles, with sex being just a thing that people do, and social life being just  game with a complex rulebook.<br /><br />Yet familiarity remains. We've seen it before, and better. Ulrich is not memorable and neither Helmut is, picture of Germany is troubling, but it is not quite \\"German\\" it's rather American view and not quite deep enough. (It wouldn't really matter, but opening passages led us to believe that author is reaching for a more complex goal in this book than this) All put aside, it is a story of a lost man trying to find himself in a lost time.

Artistic life that could soar to great hights was rudely interrupted. But what if? What if Chatterton didn't commit suicide, and he continued to live on? Wouldn't the be the greatest victory of one of the greatest plagiators in history? With these questions we start browsing trough layers of meaning in this book.<br /><br />Ackroyd is familliar with questions that troubled litteral criticism from its begginnings. Plato was first to attack painters, considering their work just an image of an image, and thus unworthy. But isn't the art itself constant upgrading of images that were before? If someone finished Vergiliuses Aeneas would that one be considered an artist or a mere follower?<br /><br />Where is the truth in art and where lies the beauty? Leading the lives of his characters trough series of bizzare coincidences Ackroyd neglects development of mere ficiton and focuses himself on finer points. Old lady, renowned author, whose artistic existance begun as she discovered long forgotten volumes of some 19th century author...painting portraying Chatterton that was painted on numerous different paintings under it...apprentice who  is continuing work of his long dead master under his name...those are all the variations of the fundamental questions that we think of when we think of art...<br /><br />If you feel even a bit intrigued by what I have written, read this book, and you will not regret it...	2005-04-05

We definitely can. But she is not important. She is just one of our crime buds that commited crime of peeping to other life, which, being literate, are not private anymore. As you read this book, you almost feel harp string being struck somewhere up and behind you, you can almost feel dash of spring breeze as it passes you by, you can feel life shaping around you as you absorb it, and became part of it, let yourself in it.<br /><br />Yet something lacks. Maybe all of these story are too banal, type we seen rewritten over and over again by different authors. Maybe that they are too simple, but they still demand of you certain wisdom in the ways of the world. Maybe narration is simplistic and it looks like something that a high school stundent would have written for his task. Maybe.

I picked up this book based on the recommendations by two dear friends of mine, not quite expecting anything extraordinary. At first I started fliping trough pages with uninterested curiosity, though concept of the novel that I read back on the blurb intrigued me, and as I progressed farther and farther, I have found myself unwilling to let it down. And such thing didn't happen for me in quite some time.<br /><br />Browse trough all demonic images history of literature mentions, browse trough your own memory and I don't believe that you'll find someone more demonic, a person who never should have existed at the first place (what mere fact that he lacks smell, basic indicator of existance shows) yet, hovewer paradoxical that is, you cannot hate him. And maybe that is the frightening thing in this novel. How can you hate something that does not have any kind of moral code, not that he wilfully chose to neglect it, but instead whe neevr learned of existence of such thing (Suskind at one place says that he had problem memorising any kind of abstract words)...how can you hate something that is, in a way, out of history, an imposibility, black hole in the structure of time and space, and even as it is a black hole, yet it craves for beauty...Beauty that he finds in smells.<br /><br />That also impose another question. How can one care for beauty and neglect life at the same time. He chose the separation between the two, but can such separation exist. And if we separate it, is it not that the thing we stripped beauty of becomes just that...mere thing, object that lies on the ground.<br /><br />This book poses many question, and does not provides an answer, but every reader out there will desperately try to find one, 'cause he'll find notion of being indiferent towards Jean-Baptiste repelling, allmost inhumane...<br /><br />And maybe it is true that, as I read it somewhere, there is just a matter of how horrid our society is, or can be. As ancient words says: \\"Hell, that is the others\\"<br /><br />A must read!says: \\"Hell, that is the others\\"  <br /> <br />A must read!	2005-03-12

Mentioning of it most often means that person lacks words to describe something, or that that something differs from usual. Even the post-modern authors, who proclaimed themselves as being post-modern, didn't yet came up with plausible solution to the question of boundaries even of modern, not even to speak of something that comes after.<br /><br />So, I shall say it now and hopefully evade your wrath.<br /><br />This book stands up for postmodern. Oh yeah. Here we go.<br /><br />Barnes was shortlisted for Man Booker prize twice. Once with this book, and other time with \\"England, England\\". Instead of Booker her received two noted French prizes. So don't you mean now that I value the books by the prizes it gets. I'm not that shallow.<br /><br />Opening few chapters of the books doesen' give us a clue about anything. We find ourselves emerged in a biography og Gustav Flaubert, and curious little incident of existance of two parrots that are supposedly models that Flaubert used when writing one of his stories. Second chapter deals with cronography of Flaubert's life. And than, just when you thought that this will be some kind of hommage to great realist writer you understand that narrator is not Julian Barns but Geofrrey Braithwaite, who is a doctor, and who is amateur in things literraire concerning Flaubert and highly interested in beforementioned parrots. Surprise, surprise.<br /><br />What follows is typical post-modernistic build up of narration, with often variying of narrators, giving voice to personas in documents and books, intertextual comments, humoristic lines worty of Kishon, conversation of narrator with the reader himself, flow of time that has neither begining nor end pas and present coexist in the same period, intelectuallity meets simple facts of life and so on...list continues...<br /><br />Yet, in all that mixture reader never feels lost. If you lack education you may miss certain profane references and you may lose some way of interpretation, but Barnes puted upfront an appealing story of search for knowledge, search for progress which can be read without all of academic mumbo-jumbo (which is the reason why this book is so higlgy praise by the critics...)<br /><br />Worty of a second readin...and a third one....ences and you may lose some way of interpretation, but Barnes puted upfront an appealing story of search for knowledge, search for progress which can be read without all of academic mumbo-jumbo (which is the reason why this book is so higlgy praise by the critics...) <br />Worty of a second readin...and a third one....	2005-03-10

There has been lot of them throught all kind of novels, and many of them didn't come even close to this one. Yet, you may see it in lots of ways. I personally, saw it as a sterotypical post-apocalypse (it does not matter that appocalypse here isn't something we humans produced) preaching of some better societies that could have emerged if thing went different.<br /><br />So they could.<br /><br />And what does that teach us? Does it teach us that there will always be a struggle in the world (though one of the caracters in the book strongly disputes this Greek tought), that there is alwas lust for power, that religion is not mere rituals and praying and whatnot, that it includes (too) many forms of interfering with bussines of the state (or rulers, becouse state does not exist in this alternate world). Yes, it teaches us all of that. Some points of it being pretty obvious.<br /><br />But, there are other things that are hidden in this book. Attempt at uniting all religions under the Buddism, with empathy as a main goal, as a main force with wich universe is being moved mixes itself with rather poorly implemented marxist philosophy which get quite preechy towards the end of the book, which in turn makes last two or three chapters almost imposible to read if you haven't stomach for manifestos.<br /><br />So, final thing that emerged from all that jumble, all kind of influences KSR putted inside, is nothing but a good mess, which tends to be quite fun and appealing at some places, and pretty obscure at some other places. Certain ammount of philosophycal doctrines are needed in these kind of novels, but they do not have to sound as if they are transcribed from religious texts and just putted into mouth of characters.<br /><br />Annyway, I found the book enjoying and quite extraordinaire for first three hundred pages or so, after that it starts to collapse under its own weight.	2005-03-07

So it was about time that I try and read it again. This time I hope I'll last trough the whole series.<br />Okay, now that being said, I'll say what is the main problem of this book. Let me put it this way. For six hundred and fifty pages Jordan's characters travel around, making small talks, noticing new and weird stuff around themselves all the time having in their mind some goal which will eventualy resolve itself cause \\"Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills\\". And in the last fifty pages entire story, or better, part of the whole story reserved for this book is solved. Fifty pages. One does begin to wonder did we really need those six hundred of them, six hundred pages of various characters appearing and disappearing, all making some wisecracks comments about life and the universe, every five pages Rand mutters to himself that he is not the Dragon reborn and that Tam is his father (though much less than in the first book -> in this one, he slowly starts to accept the fact). It is like stereotype of bad fantasy game (you might even call it a book). Linear travelling from point to point and events  just roll by. Oh, and I cannot put out the king of pathetic endings which you will have to read for yourself (if you're going to).<br />So to summarize what do we have here... It is average fantasy with stereotypical characters (while I could name types that appear in other books widely read) with tendency towards epic storytelling which sometimes gets out of hand.<br />If you are fed up with television and want to realx yourself, choose this series (or just the first three books) and then upgrade your yearnings towards something better...	2005-03-05

After all, Sex and the City<br /><br />made the top, what with promoting certain lifestyle, what with<br /><br />uniting certain people in their opinion of other people.<br /><br />And all worked well and fine, neither one of \\"serious\\" critics<br /><br />turned his third eye towards Bushnell, but at some point she<br /><br />started to write. And it was powerfull writing. And few years<br /><br />after, emerged this book, and left us astounded. And ashamed<br /><br />at the same time.<br /><br />What can you, as a reader, find in the not so extraordinary life<br /><br />of a supermodel Janey Wilcox? Can you find warning, can you find<br /><br />encouragement, can you find laughter, or can you find approval.<br /><br />Those are the questions that you'll have to answer yourself when you read the book (and I strongly recommend that you do so). But, what you may be sure you'll find here, is the satire worty of Oscar Wilde, powerfull and provoking at the same time, waging wars with questions that were, during the ages past, buried deep beneath, and today began to emerge, forcing people to give them some kind of consideration, you will find here brilliant view of modern society which has been, on purpose, stripped of all moral values, where only one value remained, power. It is a sad society, and that sadness, together wit rage, screams form pages of the book, calling, wanting to be noticed and heard, and finally accounted.<br /><br />If you liked Sex and the City, you may be disappointed, cause<br /><br />only link that puts together these two is the suroundings, but<br /><br />besides that, Trading Up reaches far more, and hopefully accomplishing at least as much as it predcessor.	2005-03-01

The story of the poet-warrior (in this case poet-police commander) is told many times now, and you can almost sketch its lines yourself. What we have here is mysterious murder, aray of tedious (alredy seen) characters, witty (and sad) police inspector and demonic figure of a main bad guy.

IT can be sad, cheerfull, dangerous, wondrous, but however you turn it, it'll always be, not so simple, deviation.<br /><br />And this is the book. With much influence of Kundera and Huxley, with beautiful insights in kusic, paintings and philosophy of art. Marvelous melodies of many voices flow trough all five hundred pages of the book.<br /><br />But, there are moments in which author overdid himself, moments that are quite pretentious, often tedious dialogues and dull dramatization.

Since you're reading this I guess you're interested in Plato's philosophy and this work in particular. I'll just say few words and then will let you to dive into the book and find the meaning for yourself.<br /><br />This is the book that belong to Plato's later works, and debate continues whether Socrates in this book is historical Socrates or just voice of Plato. If you take into consideration few Aristotelian lines than first option would be the true one. But, no matter which one is right, Socrates here is presented as few characters of world literature are. I can not speak about philosophy here, so I shall speak about style. Bearing the posture of romantic poets, and if you picture ancient greek dungeon as some reneiscance castle dungeon, you'll have the setting. And tht's it.

I remembered reading about it somewhere, remembered that it held high place on bestselling list in my country, and, as it was on discount and I was having extra money, the book finished on my shelf where it remained for a few weeks. Then suddenly inspiration came to me and I begun to read.<br /><br />And I read, and read, and finished the book in few hours. Few hours of frantic turning of pages not being able to lift my eyes from black letters.<br /><br />Well, what's in it, you ask? Afterword of the book mentions struggle of men vs. nihilism, struggle of good vs. hatred, and morbidity within not being just that. But, if we put aside afterword we'll find ourselves in a world carefully built. With people living and breathing (and breeding), murdering, lying, envying and people with every other aspect of life. Sometimes you just forget that you're being oulled into the literary world, and sometimes you just forget to wonder - can it really be truth.<br /><br />Evidently, author knew the world that surrounded him. And she was well aware of it.<br /><br />My life is not changed after this book, buit somehow, now, I feel thankfull for my life being what it is.<br /><br />Some other options presented here just scared me.<br /><br />And normality of them is the thing that terrifies the most.	2004-12-02

In simple terminology, without large philosophical words, Coetzee presents the argument, and doesen't choose to stay on any side of it.<br /><br />Without giving so much thought on fabula, or even the characters, Coetzee managed to write very inspiring book for every activist out there... and others as well :)	2004-09-14

Often happy one, but sometimes not so happy. Many times charming, and many times heavy with burden you bacome aware only later in your life. Coetzee has stared with his own growing in backwater town near Johannesburg, picturing the life as it has been in the days when he could be called young lad. Showing his affection towards his mother which always seemed to him more 'paternal' than she should have been, Coetzee paints a portrait of an ordinary child in not so ordinary sourroundings.<br /><br />Qouestion is, can that be called literature. Of course it can, but it is somethig more than pure literature... it is life itself, pusling growing, crying, evolving... With every step of kiddie John you'll be aware of 'dangers' that lay ahead of him, for every wrong move he takes you'll feel sympathy... and besides other, that kind of thing composes the great literature	2004-09-02

Mind you, this is not the political novel so do not be alarmed from the beggining. This is the novel of humans and peculiar way of interpreting the rules, way that people on balcan mastered in so great a scale that no one can outmatch them anymore.

And in the spirit of that stagnation, this book was born. Africa, the oldest continent, which lived as civilisation passed by, still, after blodshed of colonialism, lives... and it is not a life of beauty, but the life itself. You could call the storyline of the book irrelevant.

As some other reviewer said, this indeed is an insightful book. for those of you out there who think that democracy is the just system and that everybody in it receives justice ot whatever interpretation of the word you have in mind, this is the book for you. You'll learn that line beetween just and unjust is often so thin that one could say it does not exist. Stretching the concepts of right, and humane, of liberality, justice, crime and punishment, this is the book that should be read by every person who thinks the worls is set in order. Don't take me wrong, this is not some kind of anarchistic manifesto, or political pamfleth, this is the book that was written by a man who had an &quot;inside information in system&quot; and inside iformation being the criminal, prisoner even.

Why? If you start with this you'll probably be dissapointed and you'll refuse to read the Neuromancer which would be mistake. What we have here is imaginary world without imagination, characters are not likeable and you'll forget about them on the first day upon completing the final chapter. Cheap moralty and chases from B-rated movies makes this book a lousy trash SF, no matter what anybody else could say 'bout it. Chapters are written in different manner, varying in lenght and breaking the pace of the story more than is necessary. Storyline is rather uninventive without the satisfactory end, or to say with end that is no end at all. Various appearances of countless different and not so interesting characters keeps you occupied with tracking which is irelevant instead keepin' you on your seat wondering what'll happen next.

Consider the weak presentation of characters, consider the plotline that has been seen in many B movies out there, though I must confess, in first few chapters of the book, philosophy outshines the mere plot, consider the ending adequate to some &quot;dark form&quot; of Barbara Cartland and you'll have in your hands something that received the Booker Prize for who knows what reason. We do have deep moral philosophy here, we do have macabre solution of ethical conflict, we do have even the satire, but what we don't have is writing talent and the ability to keep the reader occupied with it.

That is just like the good theatre... There is no good one without that knack of talent that shows itself now and there.<br />What we have here are unispired stories, written for who knows what reason, every once in a while author even outwrites himself, which leaves him in an unpleasant situation from which he can only escape by deus ex machina method.<br />How to support something that stands for modern prose when my homelands 18th century collections of short fiction are more interesting than this &quot;book&quot;.<br />Amis may be great writer (or so I read in the other reviews around), but his greatness I am not able to comprehend...

Considering that only few years has passed between these books, I expected nothing, only disappointment. Well, I must confess, I was utterly wrong.<br />Narrative is set 'in the heart of the country' - in the middle of the Africe, showing us a father and daughter on a small, outback farm... nothing special so far... One day, father gets himself a new lover and that causes breakdown in a daughter who yearned for his love and couldn't stand some other woman to take her place... Nothing special so far either.<br />What makes it so special. When one reads Magda's thoughts one can not but think of all the lonely people out there, madneses that roam the wilderness, hidden and forbidden, dangerous... Presenting the portrait of every madman out there, mixing the reality and imagination, bloody and violent worlds that intermix each other... Coetzee finds his words exactly as they should be, there is no overwrighting, there is no endless narrative, only concise thoughts of not so concise mind. Brilliant book...!!	2004-07-08

So, what could I possibly tell you, you ask yourself? Well, for one instance I could tell you that buying this book, here or annywhere else, would not be, what I would call, move of the century. And don't get delluded by the fact that it sold out near half million copies. No. This book is a book about woman, who is insecure, fell in love with a total stranger and now panicaly awaits his call.

All wordly struggle of good and evil does not make a sense once you are dead, all that is left s longin...longing for daughters, longing for sex, longing for food, longing for everything that makes life what life actually is... and in a ceratin way that is all satirical that this book has.

What one can find stupid and repelling, some other can find interesting and thought provoking. And after all, for which philosophical doctrine can be said that it is irrevocably false. So, my rating of five stars doesen't really mean a thing. Rather to say something about book. Though I'm a 'fan' of western philosophy, lead by JS Mill, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Schelling, I find Krishnamurti's thoughts rather interesting. By neglecting possibility of freedom while conditioned by past, Krishnamurti is very close to orthodox nihilists of western philosophy. Originated from Greeks, it was widely ackonwledged, that there is no life posible outside of the community, thus the laws, ethics and such, Krishnamurti tries to deconstruct (though this sounds rather harsh) such 'trivialness' of thought, saying that ones life is lead in oneself.

Though it covers a large variety of writers and different thougths (ranging from translation ones to ones about apartheid and South African politics) I found it that only the first essay &quot;What is a Classic&quot; can stand for grandiousness of thought that I expect from nobel prize writer. Others range from good ones to ones that look like they have been written by High school student. Essays does not offer provoking thoughts, after reading them you will not feel smarter, you'll not thirst for knowledge, and in the world that I inhabit, I value only those kind of essays.

So, here goes.<br />South Africa is on ***ked up country, what with the apartheid, what with the civil wars, economy and you name what not. But so is every other third world country novadays. By putting the &quot;plot&quot; of a novel in one such country one does not justify lack of, well I would not say imagination, but something very close to that. It's like Coetzee stated: &quot;This is my world, and by merely mentioning it you're supposed to be enveloped by it, so i shouldn't talk more about it.&quot;<br />Well, sometimes you can pass with that attitude (like in Life &amp; Times of Michael K.) and sometimes you just can't. Story of a academic proffesor who had afair with younger student, which evidently ruined his career-interwoven with constant fights amongst Black and White which culminated in rape of his daughter and forced &quot;neighborhood life&quot; with same persons who did that-is a story which could be placed almost anywhere in the world. Forget the Black and White, you can put any other group in their place. This novel was supposed to be about Digrace- which title kinda pointed to. And it really is. But it's just my feeling that he lacks some coherent thoughts-it just seemes like that mere feeling of disgracmenet is there simply by mentioning the word few times and with pathetic tale which we (in a hundred versions) heard before. If you like Coetzee's work-skip this book, it might dissapoint you. If you're new to this kind of writting also skip it-and start with somehing like Age of Iron or Life and Times of Michael K.<br />And don't say I didn't warn you :)	2004-04-19

After all, you can not judge ones life, either you like it or not in a sense of discussing literature. But, what you can discuss is the manner in which that biography is written. Ondaatje present's life of his family trough generations who lived on Ceilon (Shri Lanka), in a series of random images, which are more like picture, than prose. Many times he stops to grasp certain individual and present his little history, his life, which than influenced the rest of the family in some perverse way. When reading this book, experienced reader will find such compositions that corresponds in that what crtics call 'modern', others will find interesting and compelling story, which never grows in boredom, with fluent narrative style that keeps ones eyes fixed on pages long after the lights went out.<br />Comparing the Ondaatje with other authors of the modern world,<br />Ondaatje lacks the one thing that he &quot;must&quot; have when presenting himself in a way he does. By focusing himself merely on a problems of his own, of a personal character in every (which, of course, includes this one)book, he voluntarily forgets that there is other life, other world going around him. When tending to write intelectual prose, one should, at least in one way, give some focus on that matter too.<br />But, when all this comes to conclusion, if you like (auto)biograhies - buy this one, if you don't, skip it.

And surprisingly, I was not dissapointed.<br />So, why do I praise this book in the mere beggining?<br />If you start to consider literature as something that shouldn't be just plain fun, thing for which you grab when there's nothing on TV, or every damn CD in the house is broken, than you start to have grasp on things in ways more brilliant and astounding than you ever imagined it existed.<br />This book represents one world. Many would say, that it represents Wales, and political struggles of it's cittizens, and rustical, narcotic ways of life of its sheepshaggers. And, really it does.

Very often, when we let our pen wander trough empty paper sheets, when we let it have his own free will, and when the dark ink starts to pour itself in spasmic bursts on that paper, in that moment, great works of art are being made, those works that came from heart.<br />It does not matter wheter it is the pen, brush, hammer, or a pice of wire, greatness of love that emerges from mere act of creation, marks, with undeletable scent, a newborn baby... and very often, that baby pulls along with him new generations of the epoch.<br />Master of Petersburg is one such baby. Written in a dash of brilliance, written from the heart. It does not matter that no one can adequately present the inside universe of the great man like Dostoyevski, Coetzee's Dostoyevski is his trusty image. Without greatness and mistique which is invoked by the title 'great', Dostoyevski is just another on of the \\"poor men\\", obsessed with memory, posessive love for his foster child, in the same time categorically refusing to accept his son's world, young, revolutionary Russia, thinking that those kind of times are long gone (1848)...<br />It is a wonderful book, which, unfortunatelly will not present itself in a histories of literature as a great work, but will indoubtley present itself as a great work in a hearts of a reader...	2004-02-02

But, to make a good book, interesting preposition (or a plot) is not good enough. Thoguh Gaiman had a good idea, idea that could have been developed in a more complex way (considering he got a Nebula for this), book lacks a few important things.<br />Amongst them are: 1. Prolonged narration - author often leads his characters in endless and meaningless converstion, just for sake of building his novel hundred or so pages more than is necessary<br />2. If we take the general idea of strugle of modern and ancinent pantheon out of the picture, what we are left with is average narrative story about lifepath of one man who find himself in strange situation... we read that story about couple hundred times, and this one does not jump out and screams: &quot;Look at me, I'm extraordinaire&quot;<br />3. Ending is catstrophic, just like those endings in a B production movies, with an enexpected twist in the tale, and resolution that satisfies all<br />Eventually, one finds himself wondering wath is good in this book, and one does not find and answer... this is a book that will draw attention for one reading and then it'll be forgotten... if you look for that kind of book I reccomend this, putting all things asside I cannot deny that it is entertaining, but if you look for something else, look elsewhere...	2004-01-23

Every once in a while, when I happen to mention Joyce to one of my friends, I tend to get these kind of reactions: &quot;booooring&quot;, &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;overpriced&quot; &quot;he's an idiot&quot;<br />Well, every medal has two sides.<br />These oppinions are produced more often then not, with some kind of general recolection of thoughts that critics and publics gave to Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot;... complexity, and intelectuallnes of the &quot;mere&quot; book often has that kind of impact on general public.<br />But, be not afraid (even though I know that You do not consider yourself as a &quot;general public&quot;). This book is something different.<br />Joyce is in his early stages of hi litterarie work, just starting to experiment with the chain of tought technique, and the result is absoultely brilliant... what we have received is the most beautiful and compelling autobiography, one has written in the entire history of litterature. In a voice of Stephen Dedalus (character around whom, together with Leonard Bloom, Ulysses is built) Joyce presents his early childhood thoughts, Joyce preensets development of character that refusses as the time progresses any kind of bonding with govermenet, education, church or any other kind of institution while at the same time building his own, inside universe where things happen at his command, and by his direction.<br />Language is sometimes hard, and you'll catch yourself re-reading some passages with tendencie of better grasping his message, his tought, but 3/4 of the work is written in the most beutiful english you can imagine...<br />I strongly reccomend this book...	2004-01-20

But that story is not for this place, so we shall skip it and we are going to turn our look towards these pages.<br />Brige over Drina is not merely a sociologic study as you can read in some of the reviews, it, really is that, but only on a shallow scale, scale that could be seen with a first reading. Life on the border between Bosnia and Serbia, could be understood as a good theme for a socio-literate research, but Andric shoots much higher than that.<br />Bridge on Drina is neither the story about human destinies, though many are interwoven between it's pillars and the village beside it, human destinies are everywhere, so they are present even in this book, but the are not the main subject.<br />Bridge on Drina is story about people (not about their destinies), about passability of all things, even those who are meant to be infinite, without ending, and which couldn't be destroyed no matter how hard one could try, it's a stroy about Balcan, about specific way of life, life which does not hurry anywhere, in which &quot;parties&quot; are held all day long, in which one walks over bridge for hours, casually glancing on a water beneath, exchanging few words, and gossips with people who do the same, it's a life of a little people in a &quot;barren wasteland&quot; of borderland, which was never independent, but always under some other rule, being Turkish, or German one, which influenced on society, and changed ways of life from it's roots.<br />In contrary with a modern Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian prose, bridge over drina posess an exemplary style and language, very easy understandeable and fluent, which occupies ones perception with a tones of a nostalgia which jumps from every syllable in the book.<br />You could find critics in this book, you could find wondering, but over all that you shall find bridge as a symbol of link between nations on a much deeper scale than merely connecting opposite sides of river. that bridge connects life of the people and from that bridge life became apparent in a village beside it.<br />This is a wonderfull book, definition of a fine arts, though I have a feeling that much of familiarity and warmth is lost in english translation, so I encourage all of you out there who posses adequate understanding of slavic laguages to read this book in original.<br />Read it, than let it rest, than read it again, than let it rest again, and so on, and so on...you shall find bridge as a symbol of link between nations on a much deeper scale than merely connecting opposite sides of river. that bridge connects life of the people and from that bridge life became apparent in a village beside it.<BR>This is a wonderfull book, definition of a fine arts, though I have a feeling that much of familiarity and warmth is lost in english translation, so I encourage all of you out there who posses adequate understanding of slavic laguages to read this book in original.<BR>Read it, than let it rest, than read it again, than let it rest again, and so on, and so on...	2003-07-02

Dog starts to transform, slowly at first, into a human being whose parts he now posesses. What becomes apparent in the process are all the bad thing one can have when &quot;suffering&quot; from a posession of a human heart. He losses all nobility of a dog, ant transforms himself into a man that he used o be before, with all negative sides that remained.<br />Association with the president of House Comitee Svonde, will lead to major problems.<br />Bulgakov uses his famous, fluid style, not allowing break beetween narration and dialogue, though short this novel keeps his reader glued to his chair, and doesn't allow him to leave mists of post revolutionary Moscow, mists of human spirit (in which was believed that by mere act of revolting (violent), all became different than it used to be, neglecting the fact that people that used to live under empire are the same people the now live under Lenin)<br />Though somewhat flawish on some places, with weak links between objects and verbs, with holes in some spaces, that should (or could) be filled with more detailed narration, this novel stands side by side with the rest of Bulgakov's work.<br />Thumbs up!	2003-06-22
US	41647362	R25SQUIZRQGSJ	0241140706	662168744	Deadkidsongs	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Illusions of Grandeur	Toby Litt is considered to be, by many critics, the best english author of the new english (young) prose. And this book represents him in the best light that it can. This is the story about four boys the live and grow in the small town in England called Amplewick. It's the story of their growth, both physical, and pshychological, it's the story of the obsession with war, obsessions with fight, and most of all it is the story of broken ideals, of friendship raised in an unnatural circumstances, and last but but not the least, it is the story of lack of communication, and of effects that it can have on unprepared minds (and who could ever be prepared for such thing).<br />Written in two sepparate forms, of retospective monologue, and storyteling with spotlight on one of the main characters (spotlight changes as novel progresses), with excellent language skills, and nostalgic sidenote, mixed with fury which cannot be witheld inside himself (author has integrated himself in his character), this is indeed example of good literature.<br />Though maybe not so hard to understand as some of the recent alegoric novels, this book keeps his reader constantly on the seat, not with the story but more with the growing feeling of discomfort, and perverse anticipation of &quot;what will happen next and why at all would I want to know that?&quot;<br />Masterpiece of it's own, everyone should try to read it and to understand it. It is not just plain writting without anything behind the words which became very popular in modern literature. But deffinitely it is not a book for summer vacation, or a light break from work. It is a book that needs to be enjoyed upon.	2003-06-21

This is the book, about the feeling you get when you lie at your bed late at night, thinking about all the places and person you have visited and got to know and like, this is the book about irreversibility of the time, and book about stupid mass making stupid mistakes.<br />Wraped in a form where exile is the main focus, with added retrospective of the war which held place on Balcan in the 90's, told with beautiful language skill (I read the book in the original language, wasn't to difficul considering that I'm native speaker of it :), so I cannot judge the quality of translation,) this book is a masterpiece.<br />Four stars because fourth part of the book is really bad when compared to rest, with flat prosaic skills, and simple sentences.	2003-05-16

Words are in fact, the thing which makes art, however you look upon it. And there is no artistic masterpiece without words (at least when it comes down to literature).<br />This novel is almost completely written in dialogue. It's the dialogue between Gabriel and Rex, Gabriel and his mother, and Gabriel and every other character in book. But, there is nothing in this book beside that dialogue.<br />It's an endless parade of talking, words without emotion in them, whithout and sense of fear, exasperation, passion, just plain old worlds, full of clich&eacute;s, which are supposed to make a statement about the outside world, and about the mothern ways of living in contradictio with old (60's, 70's) way of live. They try to be critique of media, of famous people, and poshy ladies in rich outfits. But they are not.<br />This kind of story was told many times before, each period has it's own, &quot;manifesto&quot; so to say, and many times it was better said by the authors who had more talent than Kureishi.<br />When I completed this book, I felt nothing. Just emptiness, which cannot fill the void inside of me that need to be fed...wiih words.<br />This book represent in what has realism in literature evolved during the 90's, and whatever is that called now, the fact stays: It wasn't succesful evolutionary proces.<br />I give this book 2 stars only for the idealistic traces of dark romantism of a lost child in a big town full of bad people.

Trough the early stages of the book indeed it seemed as one, but as I have progressed with reading I suddenly beacme aware of poor writing skills of this particular author. After reading this book only thing that remained inside my memory is a vague memory of early 20th century shangai, that, and a indistinguishable feeling that i have lost something, somwhere. Troubled by the disapperance of his parents, young detective Christopher Banks, tries to discovers their fate, assuring himself that the finding will change the world. It is quite obvious that Banks is loosing his touch with the reality, and this absence is presented in relatively harsh stile of writing by Ishiguro. I mean it is to obvious. There are no diferent levels of reading in this book, as some try to assure you, it's a straight story from page one to page trhee hundred and fifty two. I give this book for stars only becouse story is indeed good, and captures some feeling inside you that you have thought long gone, for that, and for the love that will rise toward Shangai, and hatred which you'll feel towards the corupted politicians and opium sellers. But if you don't fall to such things skip this book. This book, is in fact a school example to average writing.	2002-08-22

Some say it is the best, some even say it is the best literature ever (which is totaly ridicouluos, but nevermind). I read first three books, and this one indeed seemes the best one. Rand is in Aiel waste, facing stubborn clan-chiefs together with Moiraine and Wise ones, trying to fulfill his destiny as He who Comes With The Dawn, Perrin is defending Two-rivers, at three fronts - Whitecloaks, Shadowspawn, and misterious Slayer, Nynaeve and Elayne hunts black Ajah in Tanchico, Mat regained his memories, and everything just started to boil. This book is a good fantasy, a kind of book that will keep you wake during the nights, turning pages and reading. Only thing that is very poor done is composition of the book (not only this one, but all three of them). In every book, protagonist find cuendillar, and in every book there is one major battle in the end. One can't shake the feeling that this whole WoT series could be much shorter, becouse Jordan has this habit of finishing book in last twenty pages, quickening his pace at maximum, so you start to wander couldn't those 980 pages  be used to something more than endless slow pa ceted blabber. Kinda getting on nerves sometimes. Forsaken (chosen) are rummaging the world more freely now, and for the first time in series three Forsaken finds themselves in the web of the RJ story. This book is just the thing to set your mind to wonder on a grassy plain in these summer thay, but beware, this book isn't nothing more.	2002-07-22

But what I got here totally dissapointed me. Patera Silk again finds himself in countless situations from which he is trying to get out unscarred. The whole world and characters are presented kinda &quot;shy?&quot;, and one can not put himself in role of Patera silk, one can not live inside him a live trough his &quot;adventurs&quot;. Wolfe, at the end of a novel, invetns a relatively &quot;unknown&quot; method called deus ex machina. He got so tnagled in a web of characters and situations that this was the only way out. How logical? judge for yourslef. Rather plain writing also doesen&szlig;t serve this book as a good messenger, yet long conversation which lead nowhere, tedious pace and flatstone characters totally kills this book. I gave it three stars just for the sake of the &quot;old glory&quot;. But if you want honest oppinion, do not read this book.	2002-07-10

Unaware of the hidden political intrigues, of the corrputed offices of the (we may call it) Holy church, unaware of the mythical creators of the interstellar ship which he calls his home, Patera Silk tries to bring back some kind of balance beetween 'gods' and people. And how and did he succedees in it is yet to be revealed. Nightside the long sun was long and boring book, book that was used as an intro to this 'brave new world'. Lake of the long sun is more quick-paced, and better written than the first book. There are no more endless monologues, just a well designed scheme of thought and conversation. If you read the first book and didn't like it, read this one, you'll be kindly surprised	2002-06-27

So I won't be bothering you with those again. I wrote these lines on a hot summer day, and suddenly it comes to me - this book is exactly that. This book is a gauntlet of pages which you'll read on a beach, or a porch, and next day forget all about it. Really poorly written (some may criticize me when I say 'poorly' but that's becouse they like rather plain language), with shallow, stereotypicall characters (like Hooks, and Life), and without single deeper tought (deep tought = something you can not reveal at a first glance wile reading the book). Only thing this book has is atmosphere, thus the three stars. So, in these hot sumer days, if you have nothing else to read, read this book.	2002-06-21

This may be the most complex book in the series (i wouldn't know, I still haven't read them all) but it left me with sad feeling. Felling of ending one generation. Also, i can not understand why Luis keeps putting Miles in a position where he can boss every one around, maybe it's just what keeps Miles attractive but I just do not buy it. I will not reveal spoilers, but the role which he is playing in this book is something more powerfull then his previous roles, he deals very well with it actually. Another thing, from the moment when thing get started You can tell who is to blame for all, You can not miss even for a chance, also I think Ivan (Miles's cousin, I don't know if this is English transcript, i didn't read this book on original language) is little out of character here. All in all, good book with it's flaws. Read it	2002-01-25

Some of you sceptics, and cynics out there will surely think what I have thought first time this book came into my hands. &quot;Another lousy piece that is meant only for Realms fanatics to buy.&quot; Well, I was wrong. I didn't read Avatar Trilogy, so I didn't know the background of this novel (maybe it is better). Basic plot (You can read it on the blurb, but nevertheless) is as follows: The Lord of Dead - Cyric is trying to create the book called Cyrinshad which would bind all mortals (and gods) to his will when they read them, Of course the good goods can not allow it, so Mystra, Torm and some others which I will not reveal form an alliance that should break the Cyrics plan. It may seem as a lousy plot, but the new thing is that main characters are Gods, so it's very interesting to see the world trough theirs perspective. For the litteral sake, the book is very poorly written, but You should put that out of Your mind. If You look for complex go and read Tolstoj, and if You just want to have some fun for a few afternoons, and do not want to break head on the matter what was author trying to say, buy and read this book.	2002-01-22
