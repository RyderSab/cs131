I'm a little miffed I didn't think to write it first, but other than that I just love it. Its good to see that people other than my best friend and I have a hardcore sugar addiction. This book starts with the author's childhood sneaky treat of confectioners sugar mixed with milk or water (been there) to stealing her brother's Halloween candy (done that) to the international treats found in other countries (have you have tasted the perfection that is an Australian Caramello Koala?) I'd say she and I were separated at birth. What I particularly like is that this book is 90% about pure sugar candy - smarties, candy corn (one of the great loves of my life), bottle caps, canned frosting etc. and only 10% about chocolates. In this world there are the sugar candy people and there are the chocoholics, the author and I are sugar candy people. There are very brief histories of some of the candies mentioned, which could have been expanded on but overall this is just a great read for a sugar junkie. The very best part is the resources section in the back of the book which lists several websites to order your favorite candies in BULK. Heaven!	2003-07-24

The illustrations are great (probably the best part of the entire book) and there were a few interesting tid-bits learned along the way. From how to chill, store and pour champagne, to tipping everyone from the hair dresser to the cab driver to how to gamble properly this slim volume packs alot of information into a little package. None of the info provided here are new earth shattering revelations, however, if you pick up a hint or two while reading it, they are sure to help simplify and make your life more &quot;swell&quot; in some way.	2003-04-29

I just didn't find this to be as compelling as other books of hers that I have read. I actually found myself skimming the last few chapters trying to find something to sink my teeth into. <br />Its the story of a suicide pact between two teenagers that has gone awry. Chris and Emily's families have been friends since before they were born and the two were inseparable as kids growing up. In adolescence they become more than friends as was hoped by both families. It is Emily's idea to commit suicide and its her death that distroys the two families friendship and the life of Chris, the survior of the Pact. <br />Maybe my expectations were too high knowing what Ms. Picoult is capable of writing, but this book just didn't capture my attention like others have. I found there to be far too many loose ends and unanswered questions. Often the book seemed to be taking off in a very interesting direction only to divert back on the main course, never returning to the interesting parts. Additionally, many of the characters were underdeveloped or superflous to the plot. <br />Overall, I'd rate it a C.	2003-01-22

I am pleased to report that I loved this book even more. I don't think it would be a great read for someone who hasn't seen the series, but for those of us who have and loved it this is a must have companion. <br />The book intertwines facts about and stories of real life settlers on the Frontier with the stories of the Frontier House families, the Clunes, the Brooks, and the Glenns. It gave more indepth information about the selection process these families went through to be chosen for the show, the training they received and some of the questionable behavior they displayed while on the frontier. My absolute favorite parts where where they catalouged all of the clothing Nate Brooks was given to survive the winter as well as what rations of food the Clunes were given to last them the first five weeks of the experiment until they could get to the general store. My only complaint is that I wish they would have included this kind of information on each and every one of the participants. It may seem like minutae to some, but I loved every minute I spent with this book and have to say it was my favorite Christmas present I recieved in 2002.	2003-01-22

What I didn't anticipate was liking it better than Good In Bed. \\"In Her Shoes\\" is just one fantastic read. <br />Centering on the lives of Rose and Maggie Feller, two sisters who are complete oppisites of one another save the fact they they both have great taste in shoes and that they wear the same size. Uptight, dowdy, bookish Rose is the reliable, responsible one who has always cared for and looked out for her wild, lazy and irresponcible sister Maggie since their mother's death when they were children. As they fight with each other, they are also both fighting inner battles - Rose with her weight, Maggie with her learning disabilities. After a particularly distructive action on Maggie's part she is banished from her sister's apartment where she has been sponging for a few weeks with no where to go. What follow are months of separation that help change Maggie into a more responsible and compassionate person and transforms Rose into a much more laid back person. When the two do reunite at the home of their long lost grandmother they dance around each other for a while, but soon the sisterly bond is back in place where it should be. <br />This was one of those rare books that I raced through the first three quarters because I wanted to know what happened then slowed to a snail's pace for the last quarter because I didn't want it to end. I cried as I closed the book when I finished it and can't wait to see what Ms. Weiner writes of next.	2002-12-17
US	50014558	R2BRDBML3RSIN1	0743418174	780559593	Good in Bed	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Good, quick read	I read this book over the course of two flights and it was a more than adequate traveling companion. It was very comical in a slap stick way in the beginning, then moved into funny in an ironic way, then progresses into a pretty serious novel. The transitions were smooth and make this a very memorable book. <br />Good In Bed is the story of Cannie, who has just broken up with her boyfriend, who in turn mortifies her by detailing their failed relationship in his monthly magazine column. The beginning of the book details how she tries to deal with her situation and better her life on her own. There is a brief stint where she is dazzled by an encounter with a famous movie star that was extremely far fetched (the only reason I didn't give it five stars) but other than that Cannie was one of the most relatable heroines in the new chick lit genre that I have come across thus far. This could have been a light-hearted romp about revenge filled with fluff, but instead it reaches a bit deeper than getting even and shows that shopping or a new nail polish doesn't change one's life for the better and Good In Bed is that much better for it. <br />I love all the Brit Chick Lit books out there and gobble them up like candy, but I must admit its was very refreshing to read a book in this vein about an American girl living in America for a change. I hope that this is the first of many books to come from Ms. Weiner. I totally get where she's coming from.	2002-12-17

Its not that it was a bad read per se, I just expected more from the woman who gave me such great reads as Rachel's Holiday and Last Chance Saloon. What I got instead was a regurgitation of Watermelon but told about Maggie, the least interesting of the Walsh sisters, set in LA instead of Ireland. The characters had different names, drive different cars and lived in different countries, but to me it was essentially the same story - husband and wife split up, wife runs home to kooky family (then on to friends in this case) to lick her wounds, has a few new adventures, and finds out what she wants from life just as hubby returns for a reunion attempt. The endings differ but the whole premise to me was the same. I had already read this story once and I was looking forward to something new. <br />The most redeeming aspect of this book was the return to print of the two Walsh sisters who haven't gotten their own books yet, Helen and Anna. I love these two (although Anna was a bit lackluster this go round too) and I hope that we are treated with books dedicated to each of these characters. Mum and Dad Walsh are also a joy to read about and I hope that Keyes continues to add them into her future work. <br />Again, this wasn't a bad read, it just didn't meet the standards Keyes has set for herself. She can and has done much better in the past. Hopefully she will dazzle us again with her next effort.	2002-12-17

I read this book over three months ago and am still thinking about it and still longing for more. This biography of Ub Iwerks, the orginal creator of Mickey Mouse, is a must read for any Disney fan or fan of animation and its history. This book details Iwerks relationship with Walt Disney, their falling out and subsequent re-union. Iwerks' contributions to animation and other genres of film are large and should not be forgotten. Iwerks had a hand in all phases of Disney (and other studios') production from animation to live action to work within the themeparks. I look forward to purchasing the VHS that accompanies this book so I can catch a glimpse of some of his early work on film and have already purchased Disney Treasures &quot;Mickey Mouse in Black &amp; White&quot; so I can see all of the old black and white shorts that are described in this book. A good book sparks your interest in other things and this book has done an excellent job of making me want more, more, more.	2002-12-17

About the highest praise I can give this book is that it read just like a  Marian Keyes novel. Told by Cath, the story focuses on a core group of thirtysomething friends who have been together since their days at university. Missing from the group, however, is their friend Portia who back in the university days was the center of the group. After an ugly incident she is ousted and looses touch with the others who years later find themselves remembering her,wondering what she is doing and how their lives would be different if she were back with the gang. <br />They all get their wish when Portia shows up at the opening of &quot;Bookends&quot; the bookstore/cafe opened by Cath and Lucy. Lucy is the wife of Josh, one of the core group of friends who was desparately in love with Portia in college. Signals and messages get mixed and crossed and a delightful read insues once Portia is thrust back in to the lives of Cath and her friends. In the end everything gets worked out and you have a nice happy tale of friendship with a little touch of romance thrown in. What more could you want out of a summer read?	2002-08-21

It seemed for weeks every bookshop you passed has this best seller propped in their front window. It was on all the best seller lists I chanced upon and had such glowing rave reviews that I did what I almost never do- I bought it in hardcover, not wanting to wait for its paperback release. Three words; What a rip off!<br />Touted as a tongue and cheeck comedy about the have's and have nots in Manhattan told through the eyes of a nanny to the wealthy this was far from comedic. To me this was just endless whining about how unfair life is to the common folk, particularly those who work for the wealthy. There was nothing funny about this book in the least. The neglect Grayer, Nan's young charge, receives from his parents' self absorbtion is sad, but never funny. While poking fun at the self-absorbtion of the parents, Mr. & Mrs. X, Nan fails to realize just how self-absorbed she is herself. I just don't understand why if she was so miserable, why didn't she quit. She was a nanny, not an indentured servant. <br />If you are looking for a light comedy, as this one was hyped, look elsewhere.	2002-08-21

I was such a big fan of his first book, Slaves In the Family, I was doubtful he could equal his own work. What a nice to surprise to find that as good as Slaves In the Family was, The Sweet Hell Inside was even better. <br />The book follows generations of the Harleston family of South Carolina from the early 1800s to the present. Harleston was a white ancestor of the author who took a black common law wife with whom he had five children. Being of mixed blood the Harleston family lived a separate, more priviledged life than other black South Carolina residents, but one that was also very separate from the white residents. The family history is fascinating with members working in various performing and visual arts, participating in the Harlem Reniassiance, and educating some children who would grow up to be pioneers in jazz music. Its astounding that one family could have had such an influence in so many areas and that they have the documentation to prove it. Much of the documentation and oral history come from Edwina Harleston Whitlock a direct descendant of white Mr. Harleston and his former slave/wife Katie. The compilation of material provided from Ms. Whitlock coupled with Ball's narrative talent make this a must read.	2002-08-21

This was one of the rare books set in the South that accurately portrayed and didn't make us look like charicatures of our real selves. <br />Set in rural Gentry, Louisiana Sissy's story is essentially a flash back to her early adult years when she was trapped in a loveless marriage with PeeWee LeBlanc, a man she never really loved in the first place. This particualar summer her high school sweetheart returns to Gentry and stirs up his and Sissy's desire once again. Throughout the book we see views of young Sissy in high school and of adult Sissy struggling to be the reputable wife and mother while fighting her feelings for Parker. These glimpses show just how Sissy ended up stuck in Gentry with PeeWee and often make you wonder which was the scandalous summer - her high school one or the one that is the &quot;main&quot; focus of the story.<br />This was a most entertaining and often enlightening read. There were some very dark themes in the book but they were well handled and balanced by all the good Southern charm and humor dispersed through out. I look forward to more from this author.	2002-04-24

In Shopaholic takes Manhattan I got my wish. <br />In this, the second Shopaholic novel, our girl Becky Bloomwood seems to have gotten her act together. She has a financial segement on a morning news show, things are going great with her beau Luke and best of all she is out of financial trouble - for about the first chapter anyway. In subsequent chapters she accompanies Luke to New York City where he is trying to open a branch of his financial public relations firm and possibly to score herself a television job in the US. However, once she sees the shops - Prada, Bloomingdales, Saks and even the Guggenheim Museum store Becky is back off and running with her spending habits and it was pure joy to be with her again. She discovers the thrill of private sales, the joy of Sephora and the bliss of Barney's. Drinking to excess on a job interview, ignoring her creditors requests for payment and obsessive shopping win Becky a feature in a London tabloid that expose her as the financial fraud that she is. Being exposed ruins her chances of a financial career stateside, destroys her relationship with Luke and almost dashes his chances of opening a NYC branch of his company as well. <br />Becky returns to London dejected but not defeated. Always great under pressure she manages pay off her debts, keep Luke from losing his business completely and in the end she gets to keep Luke too. We think. The ending was left open enough to make readers wonder (and hope) if there is a third book in this series on the horizon.<br />A quick and entertaining read, this was the perfect companion for a my long Easter weekend at the beach. I didn't think it was as good as the original, but was definately alot of fun. I certainly hope there is more of Becky to come in the future.	2002-04-15

This is that book for me. The story is told by Lissy, reflecting back on the summer when she was fifteen and her father left her and her mother to have an affair in Arizona. In that summer, 1985, Lissy learns that the man she has grown up with is not her real father. Her biological father was the one true love of her mother's life and over the course of that summer Lissy learns in sessions of &quot;girl talk&quot; about their young and forbidden love. The story jumps between the present, the summer of 1985 and the late sixties when her mother was a girl. This is more the mother's story than the daughter's and shows an adult appreciation for the choices her has made in her life.<br />All in all it wasn't a bad book, but there was so much psycho babble about Electra complexes and such that it left a bad taste in my mouth. I looked forward to reading this book as I too was a 15 year old girl in 1985. While there were a few chapters set in the 1980s that were a bit nostaglic for me, the majority as I already said was set in the 1960s which didn't really hold my interest. <br />Best advice - borrow it or check it out from the library but don't spend money to read this one.	2002-03-27

Now I wish I would have read this one first so my expectations weren't so high. <br />The central characer of the book is Claire, whose husband whom she deeply loves annouces that he has been having an affair and is leaving her while she is still in the hospital after giving birth to their first child. Claire flees her marital home in London to return to her family home in Ireland where she has a total breakdown, manages to loose her&quot;baby weight&quot; and meet a new love interest just about the time her philandering husband decides to kiss and make up. <br />Had I not read those other four Keye's novels I would have probably given this one five stars instead of four, but after reading about Claire's sister Rachel in Keyes' Rachel's Holiday and other stronger characters in subsequent books I found Claire to be rather lackluster. She's missing the &quot;oomph&quot; of Lucy Sullivan, the pizazz of Tara in Last Chance Saloon and the spark of Lisa in Sushi for Beginners, all also by Keyes. Claire's family members, however, are dazzling jewels from her clueless father to her nasty sister Helen (who I just LOVE!) and they alone are enough to make this a good read. I can't WAIT to read more about this amusing family in Keyes' upcomming new novel. <br />My advice is if you are new to Keyes this is a great jumping off place - it only gets better from here.	2002-03-27

In this book Mr. Clark attempts to attach real faces and exeriences to those characters of urban legand we have all heard over and over again. While centering primarily on the &quot;Hook Man&quot; who sneaks up and scares young lovers in their cars at various lover's lanes across the country, we encounter other such legends as the Kentucky Fried Rat lady, the Axe Man, the Vanishing Hitchhiker and a few others. We learn their &quot;real&quot; stories. They are just normal people who had an experience that was blown out of proportion, told over and over with embellishments added until they reach their legendary status. <br />Having studied urban legands in a college folklore class I was enraptured by the thought of all this book could be when I picked it up off the shelf. With such an already interesting subject matter and the opportunity to let the imagination to run wild, it seemed like this would be an excellent read. It fell short of the mark and the only reason I can think of for this is that it was just too short. The characters were very underdeveloped and there were too many loose ends all over the place. Had this book been fleshed out more and some of the unanswered questions addressed, Hook Man Speaks would definately meritted a five star rating from this reader.	2002-03-09

Eventually they just grow apart again. The chapters are alternately narrated by Emily & Jimmy showing how each perceives different events and conversations they have had. <br />Ambivalent. That's the only accurate way to describe the way I feel about this book. It wasn't a nail biting, sit on the edge of your chair page tuner, but it wasn't boring either. It was just there. I didn't dislike the characters, but I wasn't all too concerned about them either. I did experience the \\"I can't wait til this is over so I can read something good\\" feeling a couple of times while reading this, but for the most part I could just take it or leave it. This may just be an age thing. While love is universal to all ages, this seems to be a book very much talking to the baby boomer generation, of which I am not a member. I would maybe recommend it to someone of my parent's generation, but never to someone in mine.	2002-03-07

You would think that after reading pages and pages anagrams, bingoes and lots of new words, I could have come up with something more than WOW! for a title. Truth be told, my head is just swimming with information gleaned from this book. <br />I am what is considered a \\"hobbyist\\" not a competative Scrabble player. Before reading this book I thought maybe one day I would like to be one, but after reading about the thousands of words, anagrams, lists etc. that these people need to study and master, I'll pass. It was fascinating and highly entertaining to read about the world these \\"professionals\\" live in. Fatsis presents the characters and their quirks in such a way you feel like you really know these people. Additionally, the information on the history of the game from its inception to the varitey of corporations who have owned and manufacutured Scrabble games over the years is very thorough and interesting. Because the author frequently puts words that were used in Scrabble games he or others in the book played in all capitals with lower case letters used to denote tiles that already existed on the board with asterisks denoting phoney words, dollar signs denoting words used in American Scrabble and pound signs denoting Brittish Scrabble words thing can sometimes become confusing if not hard on the eyes. Eyestraining as it may be, this does not take away any of the credit this book deserves. There were many times I wanted to put the book down to go play a quick game of Scrabble on my CD-Rom (which as I suspected and has now been confirmed, cheats!) or call a friend over to play, but the book was just too good to put aside. Even for a casual living room player like me this was an excellent read.	2002-03-01

I need not have been so excited as this attempt was a true disappointment. The book started with a comedic bang, but just plunged downhill from there. Touted as a story about Natalie and Babs, best friends since childhood it was really just the story of poor mealy-mouthed Natalie who never ever learned to stand up or speak out for herself well into her twenties. All this internalizing (much of it stemming from her parents divorce when she was a teen) causes twenty-something Natalie to loose her job, break up with her dullard boyfriend, take up with a new &quot;bad boy&quot; boyfriend, &quot;accidentally&quot; become anorexic (which was the hardest pill to swallow in this book) and through what I imagine are supposed to be madcap misadventures, loose her best friend Babs. Oh no, but don't worry about Natalie! You see after attending just 2 pilates classes everything becomes clear and her life is changed. She chucks her career as a publicst in order to learn to teach the all powerful life changing pilates, mends fences with everyone from her mother and father to her best friend and ex-boyfriend, gains some weight, takes an extended trip to Australia and wouldn't you know it, she gets the good guy in the end? Isn't it nice how it all comes into one cute little package like that at the end? Too bad this is entirely too far fetched to have one shred of credibility. An accidental anorexic? Two hours of pilates changing your entire life? Get real and give me a break. I think Ms. Maxted bit off far more than she could chew with this one. Better luck next time.	2002-03-01

Kudos to Mr. Ball for undertaking and executing such an endeavor, and for doing it so well.<br />Edward Ball is a decendant of one of the largest plantation and slave owing families in South Carolina. The book details the arrival of the very first Balls from England and Ireland to the New World and ends with their modern day progeny. In addition to these people's lives he tries to trace the linage of the people they owned as slaves to their their modern day decendants meeting cousins and other family relations along the way. Tracing the slaves' relatives is more difficult since theirs is more of an oral than a written history, but with the meager details he had to go on, Mr.Ball has done a wonderful job.<br />More than just filling out a family tree (of which there are several highly detailed ones in the back of the book) this book gives insights into the slave trade, daily plantation life and life after Reconstruction. The amount of research that had to have gone into this work is awesome. There are hundreds of dates, names and places which other reviewers have mentioned as being tedious or hard to follow. Considering the sheer numbers of people and the great expanse of time he dealt with, I do not think it could have been done any better. <br />This book is a wealth of information; anyone who picks it up could benefit from the information found in its pages. While a bit lengthy, Slaves in the Family would make great companion reading for an American History class.

While Ms. Gillman and I do not share all the same lefty views (afterall, I am a - do I dare say it - Republican, which is apparently the worst possible thing an educated white woman in America can be) I did enjoy her humorous spin on many things we babes are presented with on a day to day basis. Her comparision of a Jazzercize class with Nazi soilders goose stepping literally had me in hysterics. She has a definate talent for seeing and pointing out the ironies in life. I did very much tire of the repeated \\"as my grandmother used to say-isms\\" sprinkled more than liberally through the pages of this book and its not like anything presented was earth shattering new news. It was a pleasant enough way to spend some free time (although the last few chapters - particulary the one on religion dragged on and on and on...) but nothing I read here is gospel. Take it for the irreverant girl power book that it is.	2002-01-25

This book was assigned reading for me back in college 12 years ago and I have been thinking about ever since then. Last week I finally broke down and decided to re-read it and see if it was as fascinating now as it was then.<br />It is the story of three male adventurers who discover an unknown land that is virtually impossible to get to inhabited only by women. Scientific and curious by nature they plan a mission to fly over the country in a plane to investigate further only to be captured and held prisioner in &quot;Herland.&quot; While captive they are tutored by and taught to speak the language of the inhabitants. Once they have mastered the language they learn that their captors do not mean them any harm, but rather want to learn from them about the outside world as they have been cut off from it for 2000 years by their natural barriers. The men learn from the women and the women learn from the men. We see how different life could be in a society ruled and inhabited only by women.<br />As a utopian or fantasy novel, this one is outstanding. There were parts I liked better and was more appreciative of now that I am older than when I first read it, and others that had me thinking &quot;as if!&quot; If you can get past the whole parthenogenisis premise its an easier pill to swallow, but this time around I wasn't buying it. I also found the over zealous religious tones near the end to make this short novel drag out far too long.<br />All in all I am glad I re-read it and encourage anyone who hasn't to do so.	2002-01-18

Don't be fooled by the silly title or the droll cover of this book, for inside its pages is a real treat. There is a movie being made in the small town of Rosalie, MS and the owners of the three local bed and breakfasts are all vying to play host to the famous actress who will portray the starting role. As they each woo her in their own way over the course of one weekend, they are up agaist a band of conservative old bitties who form the &quot;casserole patrol&quot; to picket and protest against the film being made. In the end, each player gets their due and the Hollywood actress learns a thing a two about the way things really are in the South. This book pokes fun of the sterotypical Southern characters we often see and is all the more entertaining for it.  I would recommend it as a quick and very light read to fans of Southern ficion.	2002-01-06

Try as I might, as I sit here to write about it, I cannot think of one pleasant thing to say of this book. At just over 300 pages, it was a chore for me to get through it on over two week's time. Unless you are a serious insomniac who likes to read about one dimensional characters, avoid this book like the plauge. <br />The book opens with the author himself struggling through a bout of writer's block and insomnia and so decides to take a walk. On his walk he encounters Bradley, his neighbor. Bradley offers up the name of one of his paintings, &quot;The Feast of Love&quot; as a title for the book and offers up the subject matter as well - Bradley will supply the author with people who will tell their stories of love. We hear from Bradley's 2 ex-wives, his neighbor, his employees at his coffee shop &amp; Bradley himself. Each person's story is a small vignette that connects to the other people's stories and ends up in a not so neat ball in the end. In retrospect, the stories told from the male perspective were OK. It was the stories from what was supposed to be the female side that were painful and a chore to read. They were written how Mr. Baxter thinks womens think, talk and act instead of how we really think, talk and act. It was all just too hard to digest. I won't be reading anymore of his books.	2001-12-31

Each time I finish a book by Keyes I declare it her best work; Rachel's Holiday is certainly no exception. This is one stellar book. As in some of her other works, Keyes takes a very serious subject (in this case drug addiction) and writes about it a way that is comical without making light of the situation. She is able to take the edge off of a touchy subject with a sprinkle of humor that makes her characters seem very real to life.  Even though I do not share her substance addictions, I do share many of the same moods, thoughts and attitudes of Rachel. Once again, Ms. Keyes has perfectly managed to capture the essence of many of the single young urban women out in the world today. Bravo!	2001-12-18

Ralph's party tells the tales of a group of people who all co-habitate in an apartment building in London. Smith and Ralph are roomates who bring in Jem as a third roomate. Even though Smith and Jem begin to date, Ralph is the one who really is in love with Jem. Smith cannot be in love with Jem because he is secretly in love with his upstairs neighbor Cheri. Cheri is sleeping with another neighbor, which would be ok except this neighbor has been living with his girlfriend for 15+ years. Did you get all that? In the book we see into their tortured love lives and get a good bit of comic relief.

(Anything by Marian Keyes comes to mind...)<br />The basics were all there - a decent story line, great settings (New York City, England &amp; the Deep South), a good romantic lead and even a great plot twist at the end. However, what this book greatly lacked was a believable or even likeable main character. Freya, the woman who the book is based around is one of the hardest to like heroines I have ever had the displeasure to read about. Freya is so self centered, bitter, age obessed and just down right surly I didn't care about her at all. If I can't make myself feel for or identify with the main character than chances are I am not going to like the book. I wanted to know more about the lesser characters like Jack, Cat and Candance than I ever wanted to know about Freya. <br />I gave the book 2 stars because I do think I got a few chuckles out of it, but for the most part I give it a thumbs down.	2001-11-22

In a literary world full of Bridget Jones and her ilk its nice to see the flip side of the coin. While no where near as funny to me as the books with Brittish female singletons as the central characters this was a very entertaining read. I enjoyed the song references very much and many of them brought back some memories from my own past. What I liked best of all was that in a sexually reversed role from what we normally see, Rob was raised out of his stagnation by Laura, his girlfriend, instead of Laura waiting for Rob to rescue her. Now I am off to watch the movie based on this book and see how they compare.	2001-11-20

Chbosky has truly captured the voice of a teenager in this book and tells of all the emotions, experiences, trials and tribulations of oneyear of growing up. Charlie may be a bit over sensitive and his high school experiences may vary from those of your average American teenager, but this book shows that not all kids fit into the same mold. While the book spans one full year it seems like a small snapshot into Charlie's world and development. This is one I would not mind having a sequel to read.	2001-11-14

I have been a fan of Coupland since the very beginning and have delighted as each book of his that I read has been better than the last. However, after reading this one I feel like I have run into a brick wall. Without a doubt the characters in this book are his best yet but the outlandish antics one family finds itself in are to me just too much to swallow. Everyone in this family is sick be it with HIV, cancer or birth defects. These sicknesses cast a  rather gloomy shadow over the whole book. Set in Florida, the Drummonds are in town to see sister Sarah blast off into space. What ensues is a bumpy, jumpy prescription filled ride though one of the most far fetched plots ever. In my opinion this book is for established Coupland fans only, not a starting point for someone just beginning to read his work.	2001-11-14

It was far too dark, somber and depressing for me. The tale is of generations of an unhappy family and how each generation's deeds pass on the unhappines to the next. The main character, Ellen, has married into this clan and after her husband looses his job is forced to move with their children into her husband's parents house. Her inlaws are particularly oppresive and Ellen finds her husband slipping back into his childhood ways of obeying them and favoring his parents over his wife and children. Under these grim circumstances her children transform into mere shadows of their former selves. A startling revelation about her mother-in-law is the deciding factor in Ellen's departure with her kids from this bleak family life. While I did not particularly care for the book, it does have merit in that it shows how far we have come with the idea of a single parent since the 1970s which is when this book is set. It may not have been the best read ever, but at least I learned something.	2001-11-06

This is the third of Keye's works that I have read (Lucy Sullivan and Sushi for Beginners being the first two)and I have to say she gets better and better with each book. Of the three and of the many books I have read recently, this is the one I could relate to the most.<br />Last Chance Saloon tells the story of 3 childhood friends Tara, Katherine and Fintan who move from their small Irish town of Knockavoy to the bright lights and big city of London. Even though Tara is sustaining a bad relationship and gaining weight and Katherine is too rigid and set in her ways to make an effort to find a man, the three are living what they perceive to be happy lives. Once Fintan is diagnosed with cancer everyone is thrown into a tailspin. As a &quot;dying&quot; request Fintan asks his two friends to make a sacrifice for him that will end up making their lives so much better. What ensues is a great read about life, frienship and self discovery. Keyes writes about difficult situations in a manner that makes us see the humor in them with out turning it into a joke. I recommend this to any late twenties or early thirties singleton looking to read about characters to whom they can relate.	2001-11-01

This is a book I just picked up off the shelf with no prior knowledge of the book, the author or what kind of book it was. It turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. It is the tale of two baby girls switched at birth. Chelsea Hutton, the natural child of movie mougel Roger Turmaine and movie star Lana Turnmaine was a sickly baby switched with a healthy one in the hospital. Chelsea learns of this swap and makes it her goal to get back the life that was stolen from her by Cassidy Turmaine. Chelsea's mental instability, the murder of Lana Turmaine, a deadbeat half brother and a lot of old Hollywood stardust make this book a winner. The two women's lives are forever intertwined, but it is not until the very end that we discover who was the real puppeteer in their lives. This would be a great beach or airplane ride book.	2001-10-25

While hiding under the guise of being about geek life in the 90s, Microserfs is at its heart a book about friendships. There are lots of geeky, computer tecky passages some which seem quite outdated only a few years after its publication, but the actual story is not about life at Microsoft at all. Instead it tells the story of Dan, a computer programmer who in the beginning of the novel has no life outside that of Microsoft. Through Dan's journal entries we see his life unfold into one rich with friends and family. Aside from all the kitchy pop culture references and nerd speak this is a very touching and sweet book.	2001-10-24

Maybe I was expecting too much from this book being a stellar slacker myslef, but I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed. Addie, a very disgruntled employee working in a cube farm office with no friends is Fat Bald Jeff's main character. The story details her bond with another disgruntled employee, the aptly named Fat Bald Jeff, and how through their misadventures they take down their company. This could have been SO FUNNY and there were rare glimpses that WERE funny, but they were very few and far between. Even though there were moments when Addie reminded me of a modern female Ignatius Reilly, my favorite literary character ever, and these moments did ellicit a chuckle, most of the time I just didn't like the girl. I just don't think the character of Addie - or any of the characters in this book were fully developed. I think Ms. Stella has the talent to write a much better book next time around.	2001-10-16

There are many good pointers for those of us who love to cook and for those of us who love to dine out. Unfortunately, there is also alot of arrogance, self agrandization and an ego that can hardly be contained on the pages to contend with. This was a quick and entertaining read that showed alot of the behind the scenes action in the restaurant business, however, having been involved somewhat in this industry, there are many things written in this book that I take issue with. Add that with a blatant bad mouthing of other celebrity chefs,(particularly one who is dear to me and my city) this book left a faint bad taste in my mouth. However, even with all the ego, misrepresentations and over the top lanuguage this is one heck of a good read. If you love good food, this is a book for you.	2001-10-12

Considering the slamming other reviewers have been giving this book I am almost ashamed to admit that I think I like Shadow of the Dolls better than Valley of the Dolls. <br />Yes the timeline is off, but that is explained away before Chapter 1 even starts. This a modern &quot;what if&quot; and the characters are put in current times and situations.  I thought Neely and Anne's characters in this book were a perfect extension of themselves in the orginal. I could definately see Anne relaxing in the Hamptons and reinventing herself and her career in a Martha Stewart-ish way. Neely was the same money grubbing social climber as she was in the original; Lyon the same womanizer. To me all the parts fit. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer and that the characters of Anne and Neely's children weren't fleshed out more, but who knows that could lend itself to a third book, couldn't it?	2001-10-04

This was a pleasant surprise. <br />Of the abundance of novels about young single women living in and around London (or New York or Dublin) lately this was one of the better ones with a fresh new spin. In addition to the relationship foibles other recent heroines have had, Helen Bradshow is dealing with the sudden death of her father and stepping into the caretaking role of her needy mother. <br />I expected this book to be funny, and in the beginning it was. I laughed out loud three times within the first 100 pages. But the entire book was not so light and funny. Serious issues such as physical abuse, mental illness etc. were brought up and handled quite well. My best friend has recently lost her mother and many of the issues and behaviors covered in this book are very true to her experiences. <br />Overall, I would (and have) highly recommed this book to others.	2001-10-04

The telling of a family history via their family tree with contributions from a father and daughter telling the stories from different perspectives ought to be a real page turner. Instead I just kept turning to the end of the book to see how many pages I had left. I just could not &quot;get into&quot; this book, no matter how hard I tried. The book is close to 300 pages long, and I swear it wasn't until around page 286 that I felt any emotion other than dislike.  <br />The concept was very interesting and since it is the story of her ancestors, I hate to be so critical, but to me this was just outright boring. This book seemed to go on &amp; on and on rambling in no direction. The loose ends were neatly tied up at the end, but by that time I was so sick to death of reading about citrus trees and how to graft them that I just wanted to scream. <br />It was a very happy time when I finished and closed this book for good.	2001-10-01

This is a book that came up on my Amazon recommendations over and over and with the stellar reveiws from other readers I was prepared to be dazzled. I wasn't. Not that this was a bad book, it just doesn't seem like a whole lot of effort was put into it. The actual plot was a good jumping off point but it doesn't appear that much thought was put into fleshing it out, not to mention how highly unlikely these events would be in real life. Sure in Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet fell in love at first sight, but they were just kids who had never seen each other before. In Julie and Romeo, these two people have lived 60 years of life in the same community and for 60 years hated one another. I find it hard to belive 60 years of hate could end with a cup of coffe, a single date, a roll in the hay and a proclamation of love in less than 1 week. Things must sure move fast in Sommerville! This is just one of many examples in this book of things that didn't sit quite well with me. And speaking of things that didn't sit too well with me is the portrayal of Romeo's Italian family. Contrary to the sterotypes this book uses over and over again we do not all belong to the mafia, scream when we argue, have &quot;litters&quot; of children and hang out with the local priest. It was just a touch insulting and I do not even consider myself to be a very PC person. The spin on a love story from the older population was a nice touch, but its doubtful I would recommend this to anyone.	2001-09-20

The story is a simple one; 18 year old page flees her hometown after an abortion leaving behind the Irish Catholic father who raised her alone and her beloved boyfriend. She quickly finds a job and makes friends in another city and even manages to fall in love with and marry Nicholas Prescott, a well bred high society medical student. When Paige becomes pregnant with Nicholas' child she begins to panic. When the baby is born and she does not innately know how to care for him she panics further. One day she leaves her husband and child to go to the grocery and just keeps driving. <br />Her journey takes her back to her hometown, her father and Jake her first love. Eventually she tracks down the mother who abandoned her 20 years before. The two get reaquainted and Paige learns enough about herself to know she does not want to abandon her husband and child the way her mother does. The rest of the book is about her fight to get back her husband and child with help from some very unexpected sources.<br />It was a touching and beautiful story. Several times while reading this book I had to brush away tears. I have given great praise to the other books Ms. Picoult has written, but now this is by far my favorite and would make a wonderful introduction to those who have not read any of her other works. <br />I do think I need to include a special note to the squeamish like me. The character of Nicholas is a heart surgeon. There are three or four heart operations GREATLY detailed in this book. The descriptions are GRAPHIC. I was absolutley shocked when I came across the first one, and then learned to skip those parts in the subsequent operations. Other than that, it was a perfect read.	2001-09-17

Plain Jane mousy women who read this will come away with nothing. The lists of music, makeup techniques, clothes and perfume will only serve as a research guide to them. True bombshells already know this information. For them, this &quot;guide&quot; serves only as a document of self-affirmation. Other reveiwers have complained that some of the information in this book is dated, doesn't incorporate viable information for our times, and lacks references to modern day bombshells. It is my opinion that they do not &quot;get&quot; it. If there was nothing else to learn from this book it is that the bombshell loves herself, her own personal style and is proud to be an individual. She looks to the great ladies, fashions &amp; ways of the past because the present has become a cookie cutter sexless kakhi wearing culture. Bombshells are not afraid to step outside the lines and do something different. If the perfume you wear is not on the list provided or your musical tastes vary from what is contained in its pages but it makes you feel pretty and feminine and good about yourself than so be it. A true bombshell has enough confidence in herself that she doesn't heed every word of a silly little confection of a book as gospel- instead she slips on her highest heals and marches to the beat of her own drummer.	2001-09-17

While it was not a riveting, sit on the edge of your seat page turner, it did hold my attention. The story centers on a hotshot Hollywood producer who in a near death experience sees the face of God in Susan Colgate, a washed up child TV star and former beauty queen. After his experience he gives up all his earthly possessions and lives for a time as a hobo until he experiences yet another physical collapse. Ms.Colgate's life has also spun greatly off course after serviving a plane crash and disappearing from society for over a year. Their budding relationship is abruptly curtailed when Susan inexplicably dissappears over night. Through twists and turns and with the help of some fringe fans of Susan's the duo are reunited and live, I suspect, happily ever after. <br />To be honest, the ending of this book could have used some work. Everything was wrapped up too nicely in a bundle far too quickly for me to find credible. The rest of the book was paced and plotted perfectly and then seemed to end in a quick jumble. Other than that, it was a pretty good read.	2001-09-17

Truth be told, I had not picked up a Jackie Collins novel in about 12 years. In high school and college I gobbled up every JC book I could get my hands on and then all of a sudden, the thrill was gone and I moved on. Then one day I saw this newer version of one my all time Jackie faves and I knew I had to get it. I read it in 1 day savoring the familiarity of the orginal. The characters, professions, lingo, fashions etc. had changed but the same spark that drew me in 12 years ago was there. Truthfully, I was impressed with how well Ms. Collins has adapted her dialouge to fit with today's slang. I have read books by other authors who have been writing a long time whose dialouge never changed with the times. Ms. Collins never seems dated or that she's trying too hard. She knows what she is writing about and gets it out there. Is it Shakespeare? No, but it is a chance to escape to the world of the rich and famous and loose yourself for a few hours. I recommend it to old fans and to those who have never read a JC novel before.	2001-09-10

While I can say I definately had my favorites in this collection, each was a great singular effort. Many of the stories had surprising ironic twists that made them even more interesting. As with most short stories I was left wishing these were longer. I would like to see some of these stories fleshed out into longer works of fiction. Most of all i was pleased to see that this is a case of &quot;those who CAN teach.&quot;	2001-08-29

Sugar and spice and everything nice is not necessarily what the three girls from Alabama this book centers on are made of. Under the pretty smiles and perfectly groomed facade of Sarina Summers lies a calculating, often cruel girl who will stop at nothing to get her way. Her friend Nicole Hicks a is truly disturbed girl who is obsessed with Sarina. The third in this trio of young girls is poor plain looking Bitty Jack Carlson who it seems would have nothing in common with the other two, and in fact, she doesn't. The intertwining of these three lives and the lives of their parents set amid the social climbing south is a delicious, though sometimes shocking, journey to see who is better than who &amp; who is keeping up with the Joneses. I read it in one sitting and was really, pleasantly surprised by the ending.	2001-08-26

Lily comes to live with her grandmother after her parents are killed in a car crash. At seventeen Lily becomes an unwed mother to twin girls who she raises in a motel on Airline highway in New Orleans. She passes on her Judy Garland obession as well as a family &quot;secret&quot; of consuming vinegar to induce vomitting and control weight to her daughters. <br />As adults the twins separate due to one marrying. After a miscarrage she is drawn back to her sister who seems to be spiraling into mental illness. The two take a trip back to New Orleans in an vain attempt to find the mother who abandoned them and recapture the fantasy land of Judy Garland &amp; the Emerald city they created for themseleves as children growing up in the seedy hotel. <br />This is a very dark and disturbing book. I really wanted to like it, but it was just too &quot;out there&quot; for me.	2001-08-17

It fell quite short of the mark. <br />Walt Disney was one of the most interesting men of our time, and from the title of this book I was prepped and ready to learn more about him and DisneyWorld. It wasn't very far into the book that I realised just how misleading the title is. It should be sub-titled the MEN behind the mouse because just as many if not more pages are written about Michael Eisner as are about dear old Uncle Walt. While I have nothing against Eisner, if I wanted to read about him I would read his biography, not a book alledged to be about Walt. <br />Large sections of this slim book are dedicated to other branches of the Disney empire and not to the parks as is indicated in the title. Again, if I wanted to read about Dsiney's accquisition of ABC, the development of the Disney channel, Disney's ownership of sports teams and the like I would seek out such materials, but I certainly did not expect them to pop up in a book about Walt and the Magic Kingdom.  <br />Indeed, there was very little information about Walt or how he put the magic in the Magic Kingdom. Nothing new anyway. Everything presented is such common knowledge that even someone with only a mild interest in Disney would already know it. <br />There is a chapter about the Imagineers who helped and still help to make WDW magical. Their contributions are so great far more than a scant chapter is owed to them. <br />There is a chapter dedicated to hidden Mickeys that is so disjointed it is nearly impossible to follow. Had these hidden Mickeys been put in a simple list form this would have been a much more effective addtion to the book. There is a WDW timeline at the end of the book that is quite good and is the only reason I am giving this book 2 stars. <br />Aside from all its other faults, it needs serious updating. Some of the attractions mentioned have been closed for sometime now, The book mentions the All Star Sports and Music resorts, but no mention is made to the All Star Movies or soon to be completed Pop Century resort. The new Animal Kingdom Lodge isn't mentioned either. Mention is made to attractions under names that have been changed years ago, and still other comming attractions mentioned have been cancelled. <br />If this book is to go into additional printings it needs some serious editing and updating. Oh, and lots of pixie dust.	2001-08-17

Having just completed reading this book last night I am still wondering why was this book even written? What was it about? Was there some deeper meaning, some kind of symbolism that went over my head? I am just so perplexed not only as to why it was written, but even more so why it was published and why did it keep popping up on my Amazon recommendations? <br />This is a book about nothing. Absolutely nothing. It centers on the life of a young woman named Claudia who has a dead end job as a ghost writer and secretary for a mean, weatlhy loon of a woman, lives in a dirty apartment, harbors a secret crush on her best guy pal and who drinks on an almost daily basis. Heck, if my life was as downtrodden as hers I'd drink too! The problem is, all of the negatives in her life are her own doing. She lacks any ambition to better herself. Her condition at the end of the book is somewhat better than in the beginning, but its not because of anything she did. She just lets life happen to her instead of trying to change it herself. I had absolutely no sympathy or compassion for this character. All I really wanted to do was shake her by the shoulders and say &quot;Take some personal responsibility for your life!!!!&quot; All in all, this was a waste of my time.	2001-08-01

Instead of whiling away the afternoon engrossed in its pages, I was enraged that I had been &quot;taken&quot; by such a trite, uncreative attempt at writing, especially by someone who in the past has shown extreme talent. <br />This book trys so hard to be hip and yet it fails miserably. Its almost as if Ms. Goldsmith is trying to cash in on all the readers of books about young singles such as Bridget Jones, Confessions of a Shopaholic or Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married. However, the differences between this book and those was that the others were GOOD! And they were probably good because the authors knew what they were writing about and were closer in age to their heroines. They had their fingers on what was going on in their worlds around them. Ms. Goldsmith certainly does not have her finger on the heartbeat of the twentysomething Seattlites she is attempting to write about. In fact, she is so much older and so much further removed that her poor attempts to portray these people and their words and actions at times made me physically wince. (It was kind of like a dorky junior high health teacher wanting to talk with a 9th grader about rap music - instead of being cool, the teacher just looks like more of a dork.) <br />This book was fomulmatic and extremely predictable. Somewhere around page three you can decipher the rest of the story. I just kept hanging on thinking there would be some twist of fate, but once again I was let down. Obviously, this is not her genre. Not only would I not recommend this book to anyone, I would tell others to RUN in the other direction from it. Don't let it ruin your trip to the beach!	2001-07-30

This book, dealing with an unmarried young pregnant woman who has an abortion must have been quite racy back in 1961 when it was first published. By today's standards though, its quite weak. There are too many things in the story that are implied or glossed over. Additionally, the heroine seemed quite detached from the goings on around her. There was nothing about this character that made you care what happened to her one way or another. Set in New Orleans and on the Mississippi Gulf Coast I did like reading about the places she went since they were so close to home. It was a quick read, but not one I am likely to recommend to others.	2001-07-24

As much as I love to read, it is a rare book that keeps me up reading until 4:00 in the morning; this one did. This is the second of Ms. Picoult's books that I have read. I was very excited to read it since I loved the first one so much. I must admit I was very turned off when I began reading Finding Faith because of the religious overtones. I am not a religious person and usually run in the oppisite direction of things that are. However, this book was so well written that after the first 100 pages, I couldn't put it down. The characters and story are just wonderful. The medical and legal research that had to go into writing this book are amazing. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Picoult's work and encourage everyone to check her out.	2001-07-20

Obiviously this slow southern story about cotton farming told through the eyes of a 7 year old boy was a huge departure from the legal thrillers we have come to expect from John Grisham. As a first attempt at a new genre, I give it a thumbs up. Reading it certainly put one back into a slower simpler place and time. The descriptiveness of the scenery and day to day life in a small town farming community in the early 1950's seemed quite realistic to me. At times it was tedious to read, particulary the minute details of the 1952 baseball season, but on the whole it was rather pleasureable. Good work Mr. Grisham.	2001-07-15

This book had all the makings of a true page turner - a madam, her girls, political corruption, a hot steamy setting and more, it just didn't read like a page turner. Yes, there were parts that held me captive on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened, but then there were vast sections that were about as interesting to read as the telephone book. <br />Gleaned from her own taped memoirs and other previously written articles as well as interviews with friends and accquaintences the professional life of Norma Wallace, New Orlean's last madam, seemed rather lack luster. With so much raw material, what went wrong? Oddly the later parts of the book, after Ms. Wallace's retirement from the business seemed to hold much more interest for me than those dealing with her working days. <br />From a historical perspective I think this was a good read as Ms. Wallace's life in the French Quarter spanned quite a long period of time. This is not the stuff you learn about in Louisiana history. I learned alot more about our past mayors from this book than I ever did in a history class. I particularly liked that addresses of the houses where she was a &quot;landlady&quot; were given. I will definately spend some afternoon in the near future scouring the French Quarter for these addresses. <br />All in all it was a fairly decent book. I think it will hold particular interest for New Orleaneans like myself, but would not be as appealing to the rest of the general popluation.	2001-07-09

Why it took me so long to get around to reading this book, I do not know. Even as an admirer of Ms. Burke I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I reads more like she's sitting in your living room telling her stories than stiff pages of an autobiography. Her personal style and sweetness come shining through in the pages. I could have lived without the beauty tips &amp; dressing tips in lieu of more personal stories, but her shopping guide was a nice touch. There are lots of great pictures spanning her entire life.

You want to feel sorry for the main character, Sonny due to his undying love for a crazed woman who keeps breaking his heart over and over again, but mid-way through the novel you want to scream at him \\"WAKE UP!!!\\"  This is book I would highly recommend to other readers.	2001-06-27

As quick and easy as it was to read, it seems like it was just as quick and easy to write. It doesn't seem like much time or effort went into plot or character development at all.

It tried so hard to be so syrupy sweet and good and wholesome, but I just didn't buy into it. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character, Jenny, who seemed to stumble through life with no direction just accepting what ever was dished out to her. That her life could miraculously change by attending some classes at a school of affirmations was to me just a little too crackpot to fall for. That it all came to an end in a neat happy little bundle with very little struggle or sacrifice makes this a quick read that you really do not even need to concentrate on. The whole &quot;let's put on a play&quot; theme reminded me of too many sappy Andy Hardy and Judy Garland movies. I am not a grumpy, cynical person. Rather, I am pretty much happy go lucky all the time but this was too much even for me to take.	2001-04-10

The co-mingling of the two plots was done very well. I liked all the &quot;inside&quot; CIA operations he detailed and found some of the similarites between the presidential election in the novel to our most recent election very ironic. I also thought there were parts of this book that were outright funny. Best of all, I liked that both the bad guys and the good guy won in the end.	2001-04-08

Her life was not an easy one, but she remained fairly optimistic throughout. It was a sweet and very touching book and it was extremely well written. The way Ms. Smith wrote the dialect was impecable. It was as if someone were telling you a story in your ear rather than reading pages in a book.

Of course the only reason I read this book was because I enjoyed The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love. I was looking for more of the same light hearted humor. Unfortunately, this edition was a HUGE dissapointment. It felt like it was just a novel sized advertisemt for the first book. The passages were very hard to follow as they jumped from one topic to the next and then back again faster than you can blink an eye. This would not have been too hard to handle if the topics were in any way related, but they weren't. I will say that the chapter titles were entertaining and I did actually laugh out loud twice near the very end of the book, but what it took to get to those two laughs was a waste of my time. <br />-One more thing, do no read this if you have not read the original book as there are so many references to SPQBOL that someone not familiar with it will be even more lost than I was, and I had actually read it less than a year ago.	2001-03-28

Its possibly one of the best books I have read EVER! The story was aboslutely wonderful. The depcitions of the Amish way of life alone would have made this a great read, but Ms. Picoult went further than that. The research that had to be done into Amish life, legal process and medical proceedures had to have been extensive, and the results are a a beautiful book. She has portrayed a segment of American people many of us know little or nothing about in a very dignified way. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the Amish. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys courtroom fiction. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys love stories. In short, I would recommed this book to anyone who is looking for a stellar read.	2001-03-09

I swear, I think this woman is incapable of writing anything but outstanding books, and this in no exception. This is just a wonderful read. If you have ever lived in the deep south, you will know someone just like each and every one of the well developed characters. The characters in this book all felt like familiar old friends and the descriptions of the flowers, bugs, and foods of the south were dead on. Then there are the mouth watering recipes. I haven't tried any of them yet, but trust me, I will. I just finished this book late last night and am already yearning for a sequel. I have read all of her books and so far this is my hands down favorite. She makes me proud to be Southern.	2001-03-06

I was SO excited to get my hands on this book. The idea of chronicalling someone's lovelife by the men she has been involved with was a great idea. The chapter titles were good too. The main character, Pheobe and I are the same age, so I could certainly relate to and remember many of the events (and disaterous '80s fashions) described in this book. All in all it was a pretty good book, it just had some parts that were way too long and drawn out, especially in the middle of the book. Sadly, some of the best parts of the book were too short and could have been fleshed out more. It wasn't the laugh a minute I expected, but it was a decent book and one I would recommend to any female who spent her adolescence in the 1980s.	2001-03-03

It was a pleasant enough and easy read but one I found extremely hard to believe. That one woman could go through so many far fetched sitations in one weekend and manage to fall in love to boot is just too much for me to stomache. I think the book would have been much more interesting if it was the story of Maddie's grandmother instead of this far fetched murder mystery about Maddie, her husband and her long lost high school love. This was the first of Ms. Cruise's works I have read and it definately did not leave me yearning for more. While it wasn't bad, it just wasn't my cup of tea.	2001-02-20

Since the US release of Bridget Jones Diary I have read more than my fair share of books about young single women living in London trying to make their way through life. Some were better than others but no one ever got it 100% right. That is until now. This book is dynamite. <br />However, this is no BJ rip off. Its not about weight lost and gained, its not about trying to land a boyfriend, its not a tally of cigarettes smoked or drinks indulged in. It is about shopping. As a confirmed shopaholic myself, I could relate to Becky even more than Bridge. I know first hand the thrill of getting a great deal. I know about skipping important meetings or calling in sick just to got shopping. This book is a shopper's dream. My only regret is that I have never been to London so I do not know all of the shops she refers to. (But now I have a guide of places to visit if I do make it to London anytime soon!) <br />Its a light, quick read but one that was most enjoyable. Its also one I will probably read again and again.

The concept of a book written entirely in e-mail seemed interesting, and indeed, it was an interesting book. The beginning was a bit hard to follow, as it took some time to remember who belonged in what department in the agency, but once I caught on, the rest was a breeze. Was this a great work of literature? No, but it was a quick and fun read and I wouldn't mind reading more books written in this style. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because, while it was a very creative attmept and the email style was interesting, the actual story seemed a bit far fetched.

Somewhere around the fourth or fifth chapter you can put the pieces together and figure out what is going to happen. There are some good twists and turns, but you end up right where you thought you would. However, even though you know what is going to happen, you want to continue reading anyway. I really enjoyed the characters and all the little (and big) messes Fiona gets herself and her family into. This is the first book I have read in a long while that I can honestly say would make a good movie. Of course, if it were a movie they would have to not give so much away at the very beginning of the story!	2001-01-20

I saw the two authors on several talk shows when this book was first published. They seemed likable and very much like people whom I could relate. So when the big 3-0 began to approach I ordered it from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very dissapointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of quotes from other people who were published years - even decades before you, and if you are lucky enough to get it published you can make alot of money and appear on several talk shows.

The parts of the book set in pioneer times were my favorite and made me feel the way I used to feel as a child when I first fell in love with reading. I would recommend this book to everyone.

However,it was much better in concept than in execution. Taking such a familiar story and characters and turning them around so the reader sees them in a whole new light is a very special gift of Mr. Maguire.

This was just what the doctor ordered. The book was presented  in an easy to read fashion that kept me wanting to turn the page and see  what happened next. In addition to the cold hard facts there are tid-bits  of trivia which I enjoyed. The recap of events at the end of each chapter  was nice as well. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Davis' Don't Know  Much series of books.	2000-05-05

My only prior exposure to Ms. West was in reading Crazy Ladies, a very charming novel so when I picked up this gem I was under the impression that this too was a novel. What a nice surprise the pages held for me. As a  southerner who loves to eat, cook and entertain (don't we all?) this will  now be a treasured book. The ancedotes are true southern tales and the  recipes look scrumptious. Your mind and your memories of growing up in the  south will want to feed on this book.	2000-05-05
