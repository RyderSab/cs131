Thomas Tryon, an actor turned author, crafted one of the finest real horror novels of the latter half of the 20th century with The Other. With Harvest Home, he took us again into the realms of real horror - horror that doesn't involve monsters, but the people right next door.<br /><br />While Harvest Home borrows from historic horror authors such as H.P. Lovecraft and Stevenson, Tryon treads new ground for the modern novel. Harvest Home (1973) demonstrated to many modern authors (Stephen King and Peter Straub both acknowledge borrowing heavily from Tryon) how horror novels don't have to contain creatures or aliens to be scary.<br /><br />Harvest Home is the story of a young couple who move to a remote hamlet in New England, known as Harvest Home. The village has chosen to remain isolated over the years. While not Quaker or Amish, the feeling is similar. The residents are all either related to or married to other residents of the village. The residents are not too welcoming of outsiders.<br /><br />When the Widow Fortune takes a liking to the family, the town eases its defenses and also embraces them. The problem is that there is something sinister running amok in the village. There is something creepy going on during the corn harvest....<br /><br />When you read this novel, you have to be able to imagine yourself in a time before Stephen King's novels (because he crafted several novels and stories based on material he gleaned from this book)...a time before modern horror cinema had bastardized all the really unique ideas that Tryon laid out in this book.<br /><br />The novel was another best seller for Tryon. It also spawned a film, albeit a made-for-TV film. It was a huge hit for the network, because almost everyone at the time had read the novel AND it starred the inimitable Bette Davis as the Widow Fortune.<br /><br />Get this novel through hook or crook and allow your mind to go back in time....and prepare to be scared.<br /><br />Not as good as \\"The Other,\\" butcertainly a worthy follow-up to it.	2005-08-04

Thomas Tryon began his career as a novelist after having a fairly successful run as an actor in Hollywood. <br /> <br />Tryon is a better author than actor. For that I am truly grateful! <br /> <br />The Other (1971) is a gothic horror story that tells the story of twin boys, Niles and Holland Perry, who live on a farm in New England some time during the Depression. <br /> <br />Niles and Holland are inseparable. Holland is particularly attached to his Russian-born grandmother who has been forced to helm their family in the aftermath of the twins' father's death and their mother's incapacitation due to shock over trauma she endured. The boys' grandmother is very loving and doting, but Niles isn't as loving as Holland. He likes to play pranks. <br /> <br />Tryon broke new ground with The Other. Subsequent authors have come forward and regurgitated and reworked material that Tryon created. None of the others have managed to create the actual horror that Tryon managed. <br /> <br />This novel was so wildly popular - an immediate best seller - that it spawned a film of the same name in 1972. <br /> <br />It would be unfair and cheating to tell you any more about the plot of this fine book. Rest assured the time you spend reading this will not be time wasted. <br /> <br />	2005-08-04

Author Anton Myrer takes us on a journey into the lives of five young men who meet and become friends while attending Harvard in the era surrounding WWII. They are bound by a fantastic automobile - a gargantuan Packard nicknamed the Empress. Each of the men has a unique life backstory and is uniquely created to demonstrate a life of his own. Myrer introduces us to their girlfriends and families as we journey through these war years learning of their lives and loves and adventures.    I first read this novel while in university. I was an English lit major and I neglected my own studies for a period so that I could finish this wonderful book. I passed the book off to all my friends and my girlfriend. We were already living our own version of this comraderie so reading about this \\"romantic\\" era's friends only reinforced what we had. It was as if I could smell the same air and feel the same breezes as the characters.    The only problem arises after the characters leave Harvard. Once they move into the real world, their lives seem forced and not as interesting as they did when they are all together as a unit. It is as if the total is not equal to a sum of the parts.    It is still refreshing to read a story that provides us with such a vast landscape, so finely crafted. It is a book filled with prose-like writing that is elaborate and detailed without being bogged down by the words.    I really can't recommend this book enough. I think that you will find this to be a book you can expect to one day be taught in school.	2005-01-26

Thomas Arvid is now nationally known as the \\"painter of wine\\". Arvid's paintings are so vivid that they are easily mistaken for photographs. His style includes the deep rich true colors of the wines, bottles, and the paraphanilia associated with wine. <br /> <br />Named one of the top 25 artists in the U.S., Arvid is an amazing painter. He has a four year watining list for his originals. His limited edition giclees and artists proofs regularly sell out quickly. <br /> <br />I actually have three of his paintings and they are some of my most prized possessions. <br /> <br />I would love to have many more of his paintings, but cost and wallspace prohibit me from doing so at this time. However, receiving this book as a Christmas gift was a wonderful way to supplant those desires for the time being. <br /> <br />\\"Arvid: Redefining the Modern Still Life\\" is a comprehensive look at all of his work up until 2004 (which suprisingly is quite vast considering that he did not seriously start his wine art until around 2000). It has plenty of detailed information about the artist and his works and his philosophies plus almost all of his known wine art. <br /> <br />I encourage you to get a copy of this so that you can marvel at an artist who is surely destined to be considered a master.	2005-01-10

If the person interests you then you are going to find the book interesting - unless the book is just horribly written (this is often the case, sadly). However, Michael Ferguson has done a fine job of working with a man who literally stumbled into acting years ago in New York. <br /> <br />Joe Dallesandro (or Little Joe) was a street tough kid from New York when he wandered onto the set of an Andy Warhol film. He was cast in that film right away. I won't summarize the biography, because there's no point in doing so. However, I will say that Ferguson takes us along on a brief, but thorough walk through Joe's life to the present day. Then we get to learn about each of the films that Joe has made in great detail. <br /> <br />No, Joe isn't Bette Davis or Olivier or even John Wayne, but I would have liked to have had the biographical information appear in a bit more detail. That's my own peeve, but it isn't really fair, since we're talking about a guy who was doing nudity in \\"art\\" films in the 60's - a guy who played a German peasant in turn of the century Germany with a Brooklyn accent. This is not an actor who would ever win any awards for his talent, unless his talent was is body and face. And what a body and face he had for the times. <br /> <br />Little Joe lets us take a brief look at a Warhol creation that lived far beyond its intended artistic life. Joe Dallesandro the man is far different from the beautiful face and body on the screen. Timeless there in appearance, his real life was never what others fantasized about him. This guy is still a street tough scrapper who is just barely scraping by today. <br /> <br />I think the material is interesting and the writing is effective and worthwhile. If you have a nostalgic bent toward Warhol's Factory days or just liked his weird horror films or sexy films, then you'll enjoy reading this book. <br /> <br />	2004-12-28

I first read this book when I was in elementary school.  I had all but forgotten about it, when I discovered the ravaged paperback in a box of items from my childhood.  This was the book that taught me to love reading.  It had all the elements necessary or a 9 year old boy to get excited about it: mystery, creepy setting, and interesting dialogue and writing.  This book does not treat the reader as if they were mentally challenged, but rather attempts to challenge the reader.  It's a primer for more advanced novels.<br />When the lead character, Dan Pride, crosses over the marshes for the first time and sees his new home, you can almost feel the chill of the fog and the dampness of the sea.  It is a book well written and well presented.<br />If you can get your hands on a copy for a young man you know, then do.  He'll devour it quickly and learn to love reading as well.	2003-09-19

It is so rare that a book can make real emotions erupt in me, so I must say that I think it was well done.  I don't have to like what happens to my favorite character, but it does have to be believable and/or justifiable.  However, I'll be honest - this was my least favorite of the three books.<br />This book is significantly different than the previous two books in the trilogy.  It takes the focus off of Charlie and Peter and puts in on a whole village, with a slightly brighter light shining on a expatriate American writer and his son.<br />I wasn't always nuts about how the story moved along, because it seemed as if Merrick had become bored with his two lead characters and  was attempting to &quot;do&quot; something with them beyond that which he'd already done.  It often seemed as if there were two books here, neither of which was Merrick terribly committed to.<br />Ultimately I enjoyed the book because it finalized the two characters I'd come to love from the beginning (sometimes I could relate with Charlie and other times I could relate to Peter).  In this final book, it is important to remember what was happening in Merrick's world as well as the 1960 world of the characters.  The whole free love movement was in full swing for Merrick, but it was just finding its sea legs in 1960.  That's all well and good, but it just seemed rather forced at times in the book.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I did enjoy the book, but it was a less pleasurable read than the previous two books in the trilogy.  But ya' gotta read it!	2003-09-10

Merrick's 2nd book in his Charlie and Peter trilogy is a fine centerpiece.  It is transitional, bringing forward elements of the first book and introducing us to aspects that will be resolved in the final book (or chapter, if you will).  We get introductions to new characters and begin to realize a new depth to Charlie and Peter's romance.<br />Interestingly, One for the Gods also acts as a bit of psychotherapy for the Charlie character.  We learn a great deal more about this beloved character and the layers are great and deep, and like an onion we get to peel them away.<br />No, there is no clear resolution in this book as it is a transitional piece.  However, and I mean a big &quot;however&quot;...a new development takes place in this book that got my blood boiling and made me angry as $#^% at Charlie.  However I did tear immediately into the final book in the trilogy to discover how Merrick resolves the situation.<br />I know that a story of two men in love with each other cannot be happy all the time, but !@#$%, I sure would love to see it happen a bit more easily than Merrick portrays it.... but then, I did read faster and faster to find out what happens next.  So, grudgingly, I'll admit that rather than being critical, I have to say that the book delivers just what its author intended.<br />Read and read some more.  You'll love it.  The story delivers and heaven knows that the love scenes read in context will more than have you happy while you turn the pages.  I think I took a couple of cold showers reading this one!	2003-09-02

Several reviewers have mistakenly identified this book's setting as the 1960's.  The correct setting is that of World War II - or the years in which it took place.  This is an important point to note as it does have a great deal of bearing on the reader in understanding the circumstances of the characters.  The world in which two men loved each other was far different in 1940 than it was in 1960, 1980, or 2000.  <br />The sexual escapades of these boys is revealing in the secrecy in which they must take place.  This isn't the modern era or anywhere near it.  Homosexuality was considered a mental illness - one for which men were sent to mental hospitals and relegated there for life.  It was a time where a man thought to be homosexual was a social paraiah and not allowed to associate with regular society.  It was a time where men knew they could be put in prison for such acts. <br />I first read parts of this book that I acquired through a \\"five finger discount\\" as a youth of 14 only several years after its publication.  I couldn't really read the book for fear my parents or friends would discover it.  I perused it looking for the \\"dirty\\" parts which I was certain would tell me all I needed to know about sex between men - and then I promptly disposed of it.<br />Only recently when I purchased a copy of it and read it (as it really would be unfair to say I had re-read it), I discovered that while \\"The Lord Won't Mind\\" certainly is vivid and descriptive in its sexual depictions, it is far from pornographic as I'd imagined it as a youth.  In fact, with the exception of some of its more detailed descriptions, this book is not too unlike E.M. Forster's \\"Maurice\\".  The quality of the written word is quite amazing - it was a fact that had escaped me many years earlier and made me think this author nothing more than a gay Harlequin romance writer.  I have not yet read any of his other books, but I do intend to do so.  I can only hope that the quality that Merrick displays inthis, his first work of its kind, comes through in his other works.<br />The book is the story of cousins, one very well to do and the other no so very much so, but certainly not poor.  Brought together by their grandmother, the older, Charlie, is asked to watch over the younger, Peter, and help him along in life.  Soon the twenty something boys discover that they are attracted to each other and decide to act on it.  However, to give Merrick more his due, these boys are quite realistically portrayed, if not a bit too fawningly at times.  The story builds as the boys discover their love for each other.  Of course, no decent book can allow its two central characters true happiness without a few bumps in the road - and that's what this book is about.<br />While today it might seem trite and ridiculous for two men to broach that subject so quickly and devotedly - you must remember that at the time there were no gay bars that a respectable person would dare set foot in.  There was no internet nor clubs for such men.  In other words, one could only hope to find a soul mate or partner and then did so happily without the modern cruising and recoupling that takes place today.<br />In short, this is a fine book.  It is far superior to most books of its type and, I'm happy that it was as groundbreaking as it was, because Merrick got to see his books reach acclaim before he died of lung cancer.<br />Get it, read it, and immerse yourself in another era.	2003-04-14

I hope his others aren't this formulatic and drawn out, only to reveal a disappointing conclusion.<br />The story is one that, sadly, has been done over and over again in print AND on film.  Anne Jeffers, ace reporter, watches serial killer Richard Kraven, whom she helped convict, die in the electric chair.  At almost the same time, thousands of miles away, Anne's husband suffers a massive heart attack.  Dead for over two minutes, Glen Jeffers recovers, but his personality is just never the same. <br />The gruesome murders attributed to Richard Kraven start all over again - four years after his incarceration.  Who can be the killer?  Is there an accomplice?  Are these copy cat murders?  Who can say?<br />Unfortunately, anyone who's ever seen the movie \\"Fallen\\" or an old 1980's horror film (the name of which escapes me now), knows what has happened.<br />Saul throws a few mugafins our way, but to anyone experienced in reading a variety of books can see right through the fluff.<br />The most disappointing aspect of the book is that the ending feels thrown together.  It's as if Saul had a specific number of pages that he had to supply to his publisher, and he didn't want to go below or above that number.  In short, the book just sort of ends.  It's not satisfying.<br />The police in this book are more bumbling than the team that investigated the Jean Benet Ramsay case in Colorado.  They haven't investigated all their leads and the proof that Kraven was the serial killer is never really fleshed out.  The central characters don't act believably and the trains of thought displayed don't follow a logical flow.<br />And when was the last time you heard of a convicted murderer on death row being executed within four years of his incarceration?  Four decades maybe - four years - never!<br />I wanted to like this book, because the writing wasn't bad as a whole.  Sure, it was a pulp novel - I knew it would be - but it wasn't poorly written - just poorly thought out and executed.	2003-03-11

In short, it's got its good points and bad points, but on the whole, I'd recommend it. It's good fun reading and quite believable. I think Christopher Rice is a much better writer than his mother.

I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and found them real and believable. Oddly, I found myself recapturing my own youth while reading the book, because so much of the story rang true to my own experiences. This is not one of the most multi-layered character driven novels I've ever read, no. It's a very good quick read though and one I do recommend.

Everything Picano put into print in this fine piece of fiction is absolutely mesmerizing.  It is impossible to stop reading it.  It will grip you tightly and take you away to the fantastic world where Picano weaves a web of crime, corruption, love, sex, hatred, and kink.<br />If you read this book, you will never forget it.  I think it is the finest example of mystery fiction in the last half of the twentieth century.<br />Heterosexual Noel Cummings stumbles across a murder in action.  He tries to prevent it, but fails.  Subsequently, he is drafted into service as an undercover operative searching for the killer in gay New York.  When he enters the world, he can see right and wrong as plainly as black and white, but over time, he begins to question reality as he knows it.  The murderer keeps on killing and Noel is always just one step away from him.<br />Picano is one of the best writers of this or any generation and The Lure is quite possibly the finest book he's ever written.  When originally published, The Lure was on the Book of the Month club list and was an instant best seller.  Time has not taken its toll on this book even though the action takes place some twenty years ago.<br />Set aside a few hours to be swept away to a dark and scary world where you don't know who your real friends are.

Caucasions write with a certain style and African Americans do the same.  Patterson is presumably (from the jacket cover) a caucasion male.  In reading this book, I had the distinct feeling that a black female wrote the book.<br />No man worth his salt would refer to a male character over six feet tall and \\"in perfect physical shape (sic) etc.\\" being 180 pounds.

This is not a \\"gay\\" book.  There certainly are gay characters, but it doesn't read like a gay book.<br />Picano has the innate ability to create a world where the reader is able to become part of the action or at least the landscape.  I really enjoy his writing style.  It's not formal and yet it isn't as hackneyed as, say Stephen King.  Picano's style is such that the message he intends to convey is never overpowered by the writing itself.  Reading a Picano book is like settling down for a long conversation with a good friend.<br />This is a book about indiscretions relating to a long term relationship, but with a female being the third party.

This is two men as a couple with one of them cheating on the other with a woman.<br />I think you'll enjoy the differences and the nuances that Picano brings to the table here.<br />Take a chance on this book and see if this quick read isn't worth the time.

It isn't a thriller, though it has some of those elements too.  And it isn't a romance, though it certainly has some of those elements.<br />I do know that this book is a page turner.  It takes place in three different eras, woven together seamlessly by Picano.  First we are introduced to our narrator, Roger, and his world as a youth of twelve.  We walk through his shoes for a summer and then are transported to his 30's, where we alternatively ease into the mid- 1900's via a spinster's journal.  Sound confusing?  It isn't.<br />Looking Glass lives treats us to an engaging set of characters who are quite real and mysterious.  The setting is sultry, frightening, and often romantic.  Picano allows us to wander along through this story without rushing and in doing so allows us to become part of the laid-back beachside community in which this story is set.<br />I confess that I'm a huge Picano fan.  Though he doesn't always have hits, this is definitely one of them.	2002-01-02

Then, this book had been out of print and I'd picked it up in a used bookstore.  What a great time I had reading this book!<br />Mary Ann Singleton is the modern day Alice who happens to go through the modern day looking glass:  San Francisco circa 1976.<br />I often thought of this series of books as having been written similar to the manner in which Dickens wrote his books:  there are not any characters introduced to the reader who do not serve some purpose in driving the plot or story.  This is a tight little book.  Originally written as a daily feature in the San Fran Chronicle, the \\"chapters\\" were compiled into a single novel for later publication.  Maupin has said that even readers helped him turn the plots into specific directions.<br />I love the characters in this book and its sequels.  Maupin writes just enough that the reader can jump into the story using their own imagination.<br />This is not a gay novel as I've heard it called.  True there are gay characters.  However, to be honest the true lead character has to be Mary Ann, who is completely straight and leads us or introduces us to many interesting and wonderful characters.<br />This is a great quick read!  Even if you're not a big \\"reader\\", this book will be a great \\"on the john\\" book, because the chapters are short and sweet (but I think your legs will go to sleep, because you won't want to put it down).	2001-11-19

I usually read biographies, but this made me broaden my horizons.<br />Carr has faithfully recreated New York City just after the turn of the 20th century.  He fills his work with believable characters and action.  He throws in a few historical events to allow his book to read like non-fiction and then provides us with a serial killer mystery that keeps you guessing and turning the pages.<br />It's not War and Peace folks, but it is a darned good read.

Carr doesn't deliver the goods as well in his sophomore attempt as he did with his freshman work: The Alienist.  However, I must confess that I preferred the &quot;point of view&quot; used in this book to that used in the Alienist.  The story here is the problem.  The characters are just as rich and well textured, but the plot line feels thin and too much like a contemporary Lifetime: Television for Women movie of the week.

It is grand to be certain.  It is epic for sure.  But is it really good?  No.  And this is unfortunate.  I am a rabid fan of Picano's based on only one of his works:  The Lure.  Unfortunately, LPIH and The Lure seem to have been written by two different people.  LPIH's Picano has obviously seen too much Dynasty, 90210, and other late night soaps.  This is a superficial work.  The characters lack any real human depth that was so very present in The Lure.  I wasn't repulsed or turned off by the characters in LPIH; actually, I just didn't care about them at all.<br />It took me a while to read this book, not because it is long (which it is - in my opinion, too long), but because it didn't grab me.  With The Lure, I literally could not put the book down.  The characters in that book are so engaging and believable that I was completely immersed in the rich tapestry he wove.<br />I found that with LPIH, I felt sadness while I read it, but not for the characters, rather for the author, who seemed to have not really cared for his own characters.<br />I'm sorry Felice.  I'm a huge fan, just not of this book.	2001-10-25

She's done it! I can't say that I was always happy with the choices she made but I have to agree that they were the right ones.<br />No, this isn't the Front Runner. But then no book could be. The 70's offered the gay male a new sensibility about his sexuality. It allowed him to realize that he was not some horrible outcast in modern society. The Front Runner was a romance that gay men had been waiting for since the beginning of time. Where E. M. Forster's Maurice was a romance, it unrealistically allowed the characters to have an unqualified happy ending. Warren did not. Warren gave her characters flesh, blood, and oxygen that had been so lacking in so many previous gay themed novels. I cried my eyes out when I first read The Front Runner. Because I had waited almost twenty years for the sequel, I tore through it with a vengeance. We can't hope for the love and joy that we experienced reading The Front Runner. That wonderful book's ending couldn't allow Harlan's Race to be nearly as idealistic or uplifting. However, it does provide us with a carefully crafted, believable memorial to gay fiction's (possibly most loved) character: Billy Sive. In twenty years I've moved from Billy's age to Harlan's and I found that his skin fit me well. Read this book, if you've read the first one. If not, start there and work your way forward. This is great storytelling. Warren's books should be required reading for Pat Robertson and his contemporaries. Maybe then, they would understand &quot;forbidden love&quot;.<br />I have to give the book four stars instead of five simply because it's missing my favorite character.	2001-07-10

Consciously I know that Nell Warren is a woman, but she has an amazing insight into the gay male mind.  The Front Runner is a primer.  It is THE definitive work of gay romantic fiction.  This is the gay Gone With the Wind.  I've never loved characters so much as I've loved the ones in this book.  I've been angry with them and happy with them, but ultimately, I've read and reread about them.    Billy Sive and Harlan Brown are certainly destined to become classic exemplar characters of modern fiction - straight or gay. So well are they written.     Billy is a young track runner destined for fame, known for his flippant attitude and his unabashed homosexuality. Harlan Brown is his track coach at a small college. The Front Runner is a romance novel, make no mistakes, but it is also a riveting novel of gay pride in the 70's and exciting action.    You MUST read it to know it and if you don't already know what it's about then you've been living in a bomb shelter for too long! I won't tell you more, but suffice it to say that you will laugh and you will cry. You will definitely want to buy the sequal: Harlan's Race and the final book of the trilogy: Billy's Boy.	2001-07-10

They're certainly not bad, but they leave something to be desired.  &quot;Death&quot; seems to be written with great care and attention as the murder happens and the mystery begins, but then it just ends.  It seems to me that the author was given a page limit and once he reached it, he simply &quot;solved&quot; the crime.  The criminal isn't necessarily someone we've ever met before, it isn't someone integral to the plot, it doesn't make sense - it just is.<br />Zubro made me feel cheated.  I was teased with an engaging read, only to be left unfulfilled by the outcome.  When you read a mystery there should at least be enough clues for the reader to make some viable guesses at who the murderer is:  that just isn't the case here.	2001-07-09

Dave Pallone did something in baseball that, to my knowledge, no one else has ever done:  he came out of the closet.  Pallone wasn't a player, but rather an umpire.  It cost him his job.  Reading this book you will find that you are angered and uplifted.  Pallone did not deserve the treatment he received from baseball.  Pallone's treatment will be the reason that any others in baseball who are gay, remain in the closet.  After all, we can't have anyone who is in team athletics acting in a non-acceptable manner...  Funny isn't it that drugs, illegitimate children, murders, assaults, etc. are all acceptable behavior by professional sports, but homosexuality isn't.<br />This book will provide you with an insight into something that is rarely spoken about.  It isn't great literature, but then it isn't supposed to be.  It is a biography of a person during a specific time.  I recommend this book.	2001-05-09

Sure the book has a dream-like quality to it, but it doesn't sacrifice  even the slightest bit on necessary detail and character believability.   These are real boys.  They face real emotions and quite frankly, I could  rattle off about fifty people I knew growing up who were like them. Most  importantly, I believe Dream Boy will one day be taught in colleges. It is  a literary work, not a hack novel. No, Grimsley didn't spell out the ending  for the intelligence impaired.  It frustrated me to no end, but then that  is exactly what was supposed to happen.

As a fellow southerner, I found myself remembering the same lonely feelings of disassociation as I grew into purberty.  I remembered my  longing for being one of the gang.  However, I have to confess, that  Greene's book took several turns I never thought it would.  The ending is  so mind boggling that I wouldn't have dared to guess the story's outcome.   This is no Stephen King or Jeffrey Archer novel, with simple writing done  for the brain dead.  The prose in this book is very reminescent of Catcher  in the Rye.  You really have to love to read and to love discovering a book  to fully appreciate Greene's work.  While I'm bored to tears with the  typical gay AIDS era novel - this one is different - leaps and bounds  beyond any other I've ever read.

The book is written much like a Hollywood gossip column and bears little resemblence to a real biography, HOWEVER, it does give insight into  a line of work that has been glamourized in the gay community.  It's a  world where flesh is currency and manipulation and lying are the name of  the game.  It seems that the flesh brokers (the filmmakers and  distributors) are the only ones going to the bank with the proceeds of the  films.  How sad it is that the porn actors seem to be so insecure and  uneducated that they don't save for their future or keep away from the  drugs.  Not a great book - but a great insight into the porn biz.  Maybe we  should print bumper stickers saying, &quot;Have you hugged your porn star  today?&quot;	1999-02-10
