The close of the Seventh Tower series does complete justice to the awesomeness that has come before it, perfectly balancing the characters with the plot, with plenty of action thrown in.  I won't say much, to avoid spoiling the story for those who haven't read it, but trust me, you will not be able to put this one down!  Be prepared for several unexpected plot twists, as well as a character death.  <br />  Suffice to say, this book was awesome.  A triumphant conclusion to a series that was definitely worth my time.  I have only a few minor gripes, the first being that since the series is called the SEVENTH tower, it would be more fitting if there were seven books in the series instead of just six.  Though the final conclusion was good, it was a little rushed, and a few things that should have had scenes devoted to their resolution (you'll know what I mean once you've read the book) were just explained away in the last scene.  However, this book was still the best yet, and I was not disappointed in it.	2003-05-01

In the second to last volume of this series, things get even more intense, if that's possible.  Milla has a more  prominent role, which is good because I like her quite a bit, though she and Tal continue in separate storylines for now.  Tal's quest to save his family has become a far bigger struggle.  Now, the future of the world of the Chosen and the Icecarls itself is threatened.  Milla has taken command of her people as War-Chief, and must lead a fierce battle against Castle, while trying to come to terms with her own confused feelings of inadequacy and guilt.  Needless to say, the plot is explosive, the characters deep and easy to relate to, and the descriptions paint a vivid picture of this vibrant world.  Definitely read the series from the beginning, and buy them all at once!  This author has a terrible affinity for unbearable cliffhangers...	2003-05-01

If you've been following the series this one will be impossible to put down.  The plot intensifies, Tal's problems continue to spiral out of control, and the consequences of even one mistake on his part could spell doom for his world.  <br />  Tal and Milla seperate early in the book, and Tal is the main focus through most of it, which means loads of character development for him.  The author writes each character, though particulerly Tal in this book, not as a thirteen year old boy, but as a human being, caught in frightening events, and handed burdons that seem impossible to bear.  Thus, every time Tal triumphs, it seems a triumph to the reader as well, rather than a predictable outcome.  <BR>  <BR>  But, despite the excellently developed characters, this book is mainly about action and plot, which is written just as well.  Definitely read this series from the beginning, and you won't regret it when you do. :-)	2003-04-30

The spoofs are funny, the serious stories deep and interesting, and overall it stays true to the spirit of Star Wars.  My favorite was probably the one detailing Darth Vader's conflict with the Dark Woman, but I could find something awesome about every story in this volume.  This is a comic book, but it's well put together and durable, so it gets a definite five stars from me.  Good for all ages.	2003-04-19

Though the storyline felt a bit confused at times, this is probably just because of my relative inexperience with comic books.  The characters were well fleshed out and all the scenes (particularly those between Luke and Mara) seemed to capture the essence of every character and varying relationship.  The graphics were good, even bordering on excellent.  As other reviewers pointed out, a lot of the background characters were hard to recognize, which is saying a lot since I'm a very experienced fan of the EU and should know them all by heart.  Still, the good points most definitely outweigh the few bad ones.  If you're a Luke and Mara fan, this one should not be missed.  Good for all ages.	2003-04-05

And I thought we'd reached the peak three books ago! Though the error seems to be mostly fixed now, just for the record, this review is for Jedi Quest # 5, The School of Fear. <br />  Two years have passed since the last book, and Anakin, now sixteen, has been entrusted with the mission of infiltrating a highly exclusive school along with his chief rival Ferus, in an attempt to discover the whereabouts of a young boy who has vanished. Things quickly go awry for the two padawans, as complications arise, as well as conflict within their own strained relationship. <br />  As I said before, this is the best one yet, with a complex though not overwhelming plot that kept me guessing till the end; as well as myriads of character development for Anakin and Obi-Wan both. As another reviewer points out, it's easy to see all the small mistakes Obi-Wan makes with Anakin, all the ways that things could have gone differently, and how easy it would have been to make it so! <br />  Do yourself a huge favor, and read this entire series. Don't be deterred by its kiddy exterior, the stories are full of depth and exceed many of the adult novels hugely. The only gripe I have about it is that it was WAY TOO SHORT!! But I imagine that will be remedied as soon as I have book 6...	2003-03-31

But fate is working against them, and complications quickly arise... will Tal and Milla escape with their lives?<br />  This is an awesome fantasy series, and this one is simply the best yet.  Balancing characters and action extremely well, I was once again drawn in and captivated by this remarkable fantasy world.  While not a good book to read if you haven't read the others, fans of the series will surely love this one.  A word to the wise: buy the whole series at once!

With the introductions over, Castle is much faster paced than it's predecesar, yet wastes little time on development of the main characters.  This changes in later installments though, and the action is definitely welcome.  <br />  Tal and Milla have at last made it to the underlevels of Tal's home, Castle, as they continue their search for sunstones which hold the key to each of their individual difficulties.<br />  While not as fascinating as some others in this series, it's definitely a good book, and needed to understand anything that comes next.  Good for anyone over the age of ten or so.	2003-03-31

Captivating and well written, this book was extremely hard to put down once I picked it up.  Centering on young wife and mother Mary Ingles, this book follows the story of her capture by the Indians, and subsequent trials as she attempts to find her way home.  To give away more than that would be a terrible slight to this wonderful book; it's one you just gotta read.  <br />  The author describes everything perfectly; with enough in depth language to really give a feel for what's going on, even the horrifying stuff; but not enough to really gross me out.  The accents were a bit overdone, I thought; while they did add some authenticity that wouldn't have been there otherwise, it was awhile before I could puzzle out what anyone was saying.  This book deals with some disturbing subject matter, such as infant murder and child abandonment, among others, so I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone younger than 15 or 16.	2003-03-31

If there's one book every Star Wars fan should read, it is this one.  Written in a interesting, down to earth, though informative style; the book gives endless information on the early formation of the Star Wars saga.  Far beyond being just an endless script, full of nothing but lines we've all memorized many times over; interspersed throughout is not only commentary on most of the scenes from greats such as George Lucas and Ralph McQuarrie, but also quick glimpses into early drafts, from each movie.  Luke (Starkiller?!?!) trying to rescue his younger brother from the Death Star?  Leia the daughter of Owen and Beru?  Lando as a clone? Obi-Wan rising from the dead to aid Luke in his struggle against Vader? Priceless!  <br />  I had a few minor gripes about this book, the main one being that the book itself was slightly flimsy, and it was difficult to read at times without bending the binding.  Besides that extremely minor difficulty though, it was excellent.  Very enjoyable and informative.  Recommended to Star Wars fans of any and every age.	2003-03-29

There are the Genhents, those who have recieved the forty-eighth chromosome; and the far worse off Originals, with only the usual forty-six.  There are no unwanted or even unplanned children, parents choose their child's gender, talents, and inclinations.  Inherited disease is a thing from history books.  Thirteen-year old Darci is a fairly normal genhent, and yet, despite her privledged status in society, she feels something is wrong with the way things are, though she can't quite decide what.  Others are only confused by her strange thoughts and questions, and she is left with only the nagging feeling that only she is different...  <BR>  <BR>  This was truly an excellent book, unusual and thought provoking.  I really couldn't guess the ending from the end of the chapter one, and Darci herself seemed so ordinary in a lot of ways that I found her very likable and easy to relate too.  <br />  The only real problem I had with this book was something another reviewer also pointed out; fifty or even one hundred years in the future would have been a much more believable setting for this particular novel.  Even if there was a dark age, or a series of \\"clone wars\\" as is implyed several times in this book, I for one find it hard to believe that 1000+ years in the future, kids will still be wearing baseball hats and blue jeans, and thirteen-year old's will still be attending eighth grade.  <br />  Besides this minor detail however, this book was great and I definitely recommend it to sci-fi fans of any age.	2003-01-13

Gerda, a naive though endearing teenage girl living in nineteenth century Denmark, could never be called the adventurous type.

And this she does, until she is captured by the warrior robber-maid Ritva...<BR>  This truly was an entertaining story; with two interesting and unusual heroines, who are sure to win the heart of anyone who reads this book.  The plot was fast paced enough so I didn't get bored, but not so unbearably tense (at least not til the end) that I couldn't relax while I was reading it.  I adore fantasy stories, and yet I'm also completely sick of the repetative rendition of the young boy hero rescuing the girl from evil.  This refreshing, unusual tale is a real gem, completely turning things around, which I greatly enjoyed.  Good for anyone twelve or older.	2003-01-11

For some odd reason, it seems that all the reviews for the various books in this series are posted under all of the books.  For the record, this review is for Jedi Quest Volume 4, The Master of Disguise.  <BR>  First of all, don't be deterred by this book's apparent kiddy exterior.  In my opinion, they continue to outdue many of the adult novels by leaps and bounds.  This one literally had me sitting on the edge of my seat, unable to put this book down until I came to the conclusion at three in the morning.  I identify more with Anakin all the time, as his character continues to develop into the complicated, multi-faceted young man he is by Episode 2.  Obi-Wan as well is enjoyable as ever, as are all of the supporting roles.<BR>  This book opens on a war ravaged planet where Obi-Wan and Anakin have been sent along with another Jedi team (old favorites Soara and Darra) to find and rescue a missing team of scientists caught in the crossfire.  But when one of the two padawans is badly injured, the mission must be cut short, and when it becomes apparent that old enemy Granta Omega could also be involved, things become even more complicated...  <BR>  All I can say is, this series truly is something special, good for Star Wars fans of any age.	2003-01-11

While not extroadinary, this book definitely stands out as a good, solid story for anyone interested in this time period.  It might help if you've studied it a bit as well; while I consider myself a fairly informed history buff, this particular point in history was not one I'd studied in the past, so some of it went over my head a bit.  Still, I enjoyed the main and supporting characters immensely, and the plot was full of exactly the sort of court intrigue I love.<BR>  Nicola, an orphan living with a group of street performers headed by her often abusive uncle, never expected to be anything but what she is.  Thus she is quite surprised when the young queen Mary is so charmed by her antics that she immediately frees her from her uncle, in exchange for her becoming her own personal fool.<br />  Though it tends to move a bit slowly at times, in the end the reward is worth it.  Like I said, this book is truly good, recommendable to anyone twelve on up.	2003-01-11

Like it's heroine, it's really impossible to define, as it fits into no preformed box.  It's happy, it's sad, it's strange and it's ordinary, it's depressing and yet it's uplifting too.  It's short; I read it in maybe two hours, but I know it will stay with me for awhile.  <br />  Stargirl Caraway has been homeschooled up until now, when she enters Mica highschool for the first time.  Her new classmates don't know what to make of her at first, she dances in the rain, wears long prairie dresses and no make-up, plays a ukalele, and sings happy birthday to complete strangers.  They embrace her for her differences, and even begin to imatate her a bit, at first.  Leo falls in love with her almost instantly, for everything that she is, and yet, when they begin to turn on her, he feels torn.  Whose love does he need more?  Their's or Stargirl's?  <br />  Like I said, this is an excellent book, one I'd recommend to anyone over the age of twelve or so.	2003-01-09

After the rather unsatisfactory ending of the original Boston Jane, I was understandably thrilled to discover there was a sequel.  This book is as good as the first, if not better.  The characterizations really stood out in particular; Jane was fun and interesting as ever.  I could relate to her in many ways, and I loved the realistic way she was portrayed, exactly how a teenage girl thinks!  <br />  After many months spent in the company of a group of smelly men who have by now become her friends, Jane begins to at last think that perhaps she will thrive in the wilderness.  But all of her newfound happiness is abruptly shattered when she recieves news that someone she cares deeply about has died in her absense, and to make matters worse, the sudden arrival of an apsolutely perfect \\"lady\\" throws her off balance yet again...<br />  This was a truly great story, which explored in greater detail many of the characters we've come to love, as well as carrying a more concrete plot than the previous one.  I'd recommend this book to anyone over the age of eleven of twelve.	2003-01-07

This has to be one of the most truly entertaining comic books I've ever read.  The storyline is awesome, the graphics are awesome, and most of all, Mara herself is awesome.  This story focuses entirely on her, (making it a definite must of you're a Mara fan at all) and follows her from shortly before the Emperor's death, to perhaps a year afterwards, long before she came to be in Talon Karrde's smuggler organization.  After failing utterly in her mission to kill Luke Skywalker, Mara is determined to make it up to her master in the next one: destroy the head of Black Nebula (a branch-off of Black Sun).  And this she accomplishes easily. Too easily perhaps?  But all fades into the backround when her world comes to a violent end in the death of her beloved master...  Far from just another depthless, action saturated drone, (though there is plenty of action) this is also in a lot of ways a character story, as it subtly let's us see other, kinder sides of Mara.  Though at times she does some pretty awful, heartless things without batting an eyelash, we can forgive her because we know she has one.  As I sais before, this book would be great for any Star Wars fan, though I would recommend being at least fairly well versed in the Expanded Universe, otherwise you most likely won't know who most of these people are.	2003-01-06

As my heading states, this book was definitely better than the incredibly dull and predictable Mamoth Hunters, yet still falls short of Clan of the Cave Bear. Ayla herself is interesting, as is her relationships to her many animal friends, but this book's overall storyline was hard to stay interested in at times, at least for the first half of the book. After leaving the realm of the Mamutoi, Ayla and Jondalar travel endlessly to try to cross the glacier before it warms up too much, and reach Jondalar's people. Day after day they eat, sleep, ride a little farther, and, every third chapter or so, sleep together in truly disgusting detail. And that is basically the book. Even so, I would still give this book a highly favorable rating, were it not that the author seems to feel the need to remind me, at least two or three times every paragraph, what a perfect man Jondalar is, and how lucky Ayla is to have him. Particularly when Jondalar is in reality one of the least perfect men in the series. He's jealous, selfish, whiny, and has two thoughts in his brain; sex, and protecting his current investment in continuing sex, Ayla. Still, it ends on a high note, which leaves me with high hopes for the next one.	2002-12-29

I never thought I'd get into the comic books, but after reading and enjoying Star Wars Tales, I decided to give this one a try too, and I was certainly not dissapointed!  The story is done very tastefully, showing what logically would have happened if the attempt to destroy the Death Star had failed.  The characters are right on, and the concept of Leia on the dark side is just to cool to resist.  The conclusion made the whole book; and I'm sure any true Star Wars fan would agree.

This book however, comes close. <br />  All the characters are portrayed excellently, particularly the relationship between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. As for Coll and Rella, I didn't want to get attached to them, but in the end the author's pure skill made me care what happened to them regardless. <br />  The plot is well done; complex enough to keep me interested, but not so hopelessly convoluted so that I couldn't follow what was going on. As other reviewers have pointed out this is largely a political thriller, but it also doesn't lack plenty of action for those of you who live for heart stopping fight scenes. <br />  Anyway, it takes place about a year before Episode 1, as the Republic enters its early stages of decline. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are dispatched with several other Jedi, including Vergere of the New Jedi Order, to monitor a few terrorist groups on a certain planet, but an assassination attempt on Chancellor Valorum complicates matters, as does an infamous though goodhearted outlaw known as Coll, who becomes tangled in matters... <br />  To reveal more of the plot would be a crime, so I'll just say that this is definitely one of the better prequel novels; one any Star Wars fan of any age should read.	2002-12-27

It was unpredictable enough so that, unlike most fantasy books I read I really couldn't guess how it would end after finishing the first chapter, but also not so intense so that it couldn't appeal to younger kids as well.  The plot flowed along nicely in most places, though a few times it got a bit dull and difficult to move through.  Rialle has been raised for most of her life on the Isle of Echorium, where children who possess magical talents are taught how to \\"sing\\" their powers.  She's truly happy there; not only is she the best at what she does, but she's also lucky enough to have friends who adore her.  However, she somehow knows her childhood is over when one day, the first Singer summons her to go on a dangerous mission to try to help the half-creatures, whose angiushed wailings only Rialle seems able to hear...  Without giving away more of the plot, I can definitely say that this would be an excellent book for anyone ten or older.	2002-12-14

The overall writing wasn't bad at all, but for this particular instalment, the author's unemotional writing style seemed to almost mock events that should have been tear-jerkers (Jacen's 'return from the dead', his respective reunions with those he knew 'in life', Jaina continuing struggle against the dark side etc..).  <BR>  <BR>  This book starts out shortly after the close of Traitor; Jacen's on his way home after a year of absence following his capture at Myrkr.  His youth is behind him, his experiences with the vong have aged him far beyond his nineteen years.  He's a man now, physically and mentally.  Following the death of Fey'lya, the race for the next Chief of State is on, and the Jedi are finally coming together and taking decisive steps towards victory for the good guys.  Jaina still blames herself for Anakin's death, and it becomes quickly clear that even getting Jacen back isn't enough to ease this guilt and pain for her, as she continues to fight against the dark side and hurl herself with almost suicidal intent against the enemy.  While I'm not about to add her to my list of possible upcoming character deaths, this is clearly on it's way to becoming a major theme in the series, one which I look forward to seeing resolved, or not.<br />  Things seem to be improving overall, and several themes in this book raise interesting philosophical questions.  If you are facing an enemy that threatens extinction, are you justified in destroying them utterly?  What DOES it mean to be a Jedi?  Does having other commitments (ie marriage and children) endanger a Jedi's true mission, or make her a stronger warrior?  <br />  This was one of the more interesting aspects of the book, but still I found most of it decidely mediocre.  If you're just starting out, definitely start at the beginning, before the New Jedi Order even, if you have the time and patience.<br/>Things That Made This Book Really Stink:<br />1. The anticlimactic reunion between the twins.  Come on!  They've been seperated for a year, and during that time all either of them did was think about the other one, now when they finally meet again they basically just say \\"Oh, hey. How you been?\\"<br />2. Jaina and Jag's continuing relationship.  Ugh!  While luckily there were no kissing scenes for me to suffer through in this one, just the fact that they're still together is enough to take the shine off even the best book.  I really don't like Jag.  Jaina belongs, and has always belonged with Zekk, but I think I'd even tolerate Kyp in that role if it just meant that Jag was out of the picture.<br />3. The abscence of little Ben Skywalker.  I realize a year and a half year old baby doesn't really have a place in this fast-paced storyline, but he is Luke's son after all.  It would have taken up about five more paragraphs to include him in even one scene, and let us know what his first words are at least!  <br />4. Jacen's beard.  I hate it when guys do this, it's a total waste of good looks.<br />5. Two words.  Danni Quee.  *sigh* Just when I thought we'd gotten rid of her for good.  She was only in one or two scenes, but even that was enough to almost ruin the book for me.  I sincerely hope that this isn't a prelude to a future relationship between her and Jacen.  Even the thought of them together makes me sick; he belongs with Tenel Ka!<br />Things That Made This Book Worth Reading:<br />1. The death of certain villian.  This was extremely unexpected, and it happens in a way and at the hands of someone you'd never expect in a million years.<br />2. Luke and Mara.  Nothing like a few well placed love scenes between our favorite Jedi couple to make a dull book worth it anyway. <br />3. Alpha Red.  I've been contemplating this for weeks and I still don't know what would be the 'right' course of action for our heroes at this new twist in the series.  It really made methink.  <br />If you're willing to accept a few minor annoyances, this book is sure to please.	2002-10-28

The third and final book of the Water trilogy begins with Nia and Corwin about to swim to Atlantis, in a last ditch attempt to stop the evil Myrmyd, Ma'el, from taking control over the world.  Corwin meanwhile is privately worried that his budding relationship with Nia is doomed, since myrmyds tend to frown upon even marrying into another clan, much less another species.  The plot gets fairly predictable at this point, and while I still cared enough about the characters to keep reading, this was only just barely.  The romance in particular seemed forced; I could almost see the author inserting in kissing scenes as an afterthought.  The ending is depressing, as such things are, but by then I cared so little about it that I was just glad to see it end.	2002-10-12

When, early one morning, the fortune he's always dreamed of falls straight into his lap in the form as a stunningly beautiful seashell.  It immediatelly begins gives him strange visions of beautiful girl from the sea.  Frightened of what he fears may be his neglected magical talents resurfacing, Corwin tries to hide himself and the shell, only to find it almost immediately stolen from him, and the girl from his visions (Nia) meets him face to face, and from her he learns the awful truth.  They have been mentally joined together by their respective magical talents through the bite of a small creature living in Corwin's shell; if they do not find the shell and the creature within seven days and complete a ceremony known as the Naming, then Corwin and Nia will both die.  From then on it is a race against time, as this unusual sparkling fantasy adventure takes us to other worlds.  This book was a reasonably good continuation of the first one, but it is definitely one of those books that's hard to really get unless you've read the first one.  I bought the whole series at once, luckily.  Another thing: the romance!  Don't get me wrong here; I like romance all right, but I never like it just for the sake of it being romance, and I'm always very choosy about which couples I believe in.  Nia and Corwin could have been very nice and cute, had it been presented in a different way.  This book makes it seem like it was almost nothing but physical attraction on Corwin's part, and even that seems stiff and forced.  The scene where Corwin 'has' to kiss Nia so he can breathe underwater will make even the most shallow teenager roll her/his eyes.  Despite this however, it wasn't enough to make me take away more than one star, and I have high hopes that the final installment will be much better.	2002-09-29

Sixteen year old Jane Peck, proper lady of Philidalphia, has just recieved her dream come true; her childhood crush, William Baldt, has just asked for her hand in marriage, if only she will join him far across the ocean.  However, after five months of seasickness and boredom, as she finally reaches her goal, William has mysteriously vanished, and Jane is forced to put aside many of her scruples for the sake of survival in the untamed wilderness.  As Jane becomes more comfortable in her suroundings, gradually turning back into the wild tomboy she once was, a difficult question arises; when William sees the strong, confident young woman she has become, will he still want her? And, more importantly, does she even care?  This was a wonderful, historical, coming of age story that has to be one the most enjoyable books I've had the pleasure of reading in a while.  Jane was a charming, funny, easy to relate to heroine, who made this book quite fun.  The only thing that kept this one from getting five stars was the rather confusing and ambiguous ending, which I will leave you to discover for yourself.  Good for all ages.	2002-09-26

Fourteen year old Anakin Skywalker has been a padawan for nearly six years, and in that time he has learned much, despite his lingering difficulties in controlling his anger.  He and Obi-Wan are sent with two other Jedi teams, one containing Anakin's rival, on a fairly routine mission, to mediate and oversee the Galaxy Games (The Olympics, Star Wars style).  It doesn't take Anakin long however, to discover another event going on, an illegal one.  Podracing.  To give away more of the plot would be a crime to this wonderful book, but let me just say that this one is most definatelly full of suprises.  I read it in a few hours, and hated putting it down even for a minute.  I recommend it to any and every Star Wars fan, young or old.	2002-09-26

This book is highly informative, updated to include everything up to around Hero's Trial (New Jedi Order), which makes it a must even if you already have the more presentable Star Wars Encyclopedia.  While the Encyclopedia has more interesting and fact filled entrys, it's also hideousely out of date, a problem that this one would easily correct!  I read it cover to cover in a few days, and was quite impressed with how much research went into it, and how few errors were made.  Even so, I have to say I'd recommend this book mainly to fans experienced with EU stuff, lest they quickly become lost and overwhelmed.	2002-09-26

If you read and loved Clan of the Cave Bear, as I did, don't expect an equivelent masterpiece with this one.  The main bulk of the story is basically a plot stolen from a glorified romance novel, and while Ayla's continued transformation into her own woman is interesting, her dependance on Jondalar really makes it null.  The book picks up immediately after the close of Valley of Horses, as Ayla and Jondalar find themselves in the territory of the Mamotoi, a group of mamoth hunters.  Ayla feels accepted right away, as she makes new friends, learns new skills, and even aquires a few admirers.  Jondalar however, is still eager to go back to his own people, and anxious to be on their way.  Ayla finds herself more and more attracted to another man, which naturally makes Jondalar quite jealous, and the story basically progressess very predictably from there.  The love triangle drags on for far too long, and is really only there to add some much needed variety to Ayla and Jondalar's extremelly boring and pointless relationship.  By the end I was really hoping she'd ditch both the guys and go for the fourteen year old.  So, while not the best in the series by a long shot, it is neccesary if you want to get the full effect of Ayla's story.	2002-09-25

This book has gotten decidedly mixed reviews, and I have to say I agree.  The first two thirds of the book were excellent, as we see Ayla grow and mature from a frightened young girl alone in the world, to a confident and powerful young women, breaking the taboos of the Clan on a daily basis.  The extremely graphic sex scenes I can't really comment on, since, being the prudish teenager that I am I skipped over them all, but there was certainly enough of them that I must have neglected half the book.  The book picks up shortly after the end of the previous one, with Ayla, now in her mid-teens, alone in the wilderness once again, and grieving for the famiy she will never see again.  She settles into a comfortable valley, begins to learn to use the hunting weapons forbiddon to women, living and surviving on her own.  She begins to build a new family as well, adopting first the young colt Whinney, then Baby, an infant cave lion.  This section of the book was great, exactly the kind of book I've been waiting to read for years.  However, enter Jondalar, a young man of the \\"others\\" who embarks on a journey with his little brother.  They wander around pointlessly for a while, Jondalar impregnates several women and then leaves, and inevitably meets up with Ayla towards the end of the book.  Their love story was stiff and unbelievable, and Jondalar is an over testosterone charged [guy], who has one goal and motivation in life, sex.  By the end of the book I was praying someone would just push him off a cliff or something, but unfortunately I was disapointed.  Rest ashured parents; this is not a book for children.	2002-09-24

If you're looking for a story that has beauty and depth, excitement and emotion, as well as the strength of character that so many books lack, than this one is for you.  Free of the commen stereotypes that plague so large of percentage of modern literature, this book has everything going for it.  The writing is excellent, the characters believable, and the plot exciting.  The story centers around five year old Ayla, a human being, who, after losing her family to a natural disaster, is reluctantly taken in by the Neanderthal Clan, and slowly nursed back to health.  As Ayla grows older, many members of the Clan are increasingly disturbed by her strange tendancies and quirks, which rise to the surface no matter how hard she tries to be a proper clan female, and the question is; can Ayla conform to her new suroundings, and, more importantly, does she want to?  This is an excellent book that will make you laugh, cry, and, for a short time, feel as if you too live in prehistoric Europe.  This book has some disturbing subject matter, including a violent and graphic rape scene, so I have to say I wouldn't recomend this book or it's sequels to anyone younger than sixteen or seventeen.	2002-09-24

I never have been, (into comics, that is) but this caught my eye one day at the last minute in the bookstore, so I picked it up just for the heck of it.  And I have to say, that I enjoyed it quite a bit as a whole.  Some of the spoofs were really silly, (as in, not worthy of Star Wars) but most everything else was great, the story detailing Padme's first boyfriend was sweet, and the one about Darth Vader and Threepio almost had me in tears.  So, I'd recommend this one to anyone with a reasonable amount of EU experience, and a good sense of humor.  Good for all ages.	2002-09-21

Four years after his previous adventures in the Circle of Magic series, a now teenaged Briar has graduated to magehood and is now traveling with his beloved teacher, Rosethorn, continuing to hone his skills in his powerful nature magic.  <br />  When they stop for a while in the city of Chammar, Briar discovers a powerful young mage, as unaware of her power as he once was, living on the street.  Reminded vividly of his own days as a street rat, Briar determines to find young Evvy a teacher in her own kind of magic, only to be informed that the only other fully trained Stone Mage in town is a total jerk and idiot, which means that the task inevitably must fall to Briar, young as he is.  <br />  Meanwhile, unbeknowst to Briar, warring street gangs are planning to use Evvy to help them locate treasure.  Briar must rise above his dark past once and for all, to save himself, and Evvy...<br />  This book was excellent, a true blessing to the series!  Once again, Sandry, Daja, and Tris are missing, but since Briar was my favorite to begin with, it was fun just watching him for a while.  Evvy as well was a fun and unique character, different enough from all of Briar's \\"foster sisters\\" so one wouldn't feel irritated at her replacement of them in this tale.  While this book had the same basic premise as it's predecessar \\"one of our young mages is forced to take on a student of their own\\" it's also very, very different from Magic Steps, so the similarities are charming rather than tedious.  These books would be good for anyone twelve on up, especially those who've already read the Circle of Magic series, and Magic Steps, though this book is easily read on it's own as well.	2002-08-04

This book is, without a doubt, one of the best Star Wars books to ever be published.  Though very very different then the previous twelve, this book is my favorite so far, and probably the best written as well, surpassing even Star by Star.  <br />  As I mentioned before this book differs considerably from all that have come before it, the most immediate difference being that there is only one true main character, Jacen Solo.  Far from the wide sweeping epics of the past, this book takes place over a much longer space of time than the others, picking up just after Star by Star extending well beyond Rebel Stand.  Also, there is only one storyline, and that is Jacen's.  All the events in this book revolve around him, and his searching as to his place in the universe comes to a head at last.  This book is deeply philosophical, without a lot of action, which will, I'm sure, annoy some fans, but truly, this book is worth far more than the usual. <br />  Anyway, not long after the stunning events of Star by Star, Jacen lies in the Embrace of Pain, the Vong's favorite torture device, as the mysterious Vergere alternately tortures him and tends to him.  Vergere seems like a traitor to all sides, but is it possible she is actually helping Jacen?<br />  While Dark Journey was great, and I thought it described well Jaina's feelings about Anakin's death, it didn't even come close to this book's in depth description of the trauma and guilt and grief of losing a sibling.  I don't think anyone who has a sibling could not be touched by the powerful emotions this book calls up.  By the end of the book, I was missing Anakin all over again!<br />  Do yourself a favor and avoid all spoilers before reading this book.  I guarentee it won't disapoint any true Star Wars fan.	2002-08-02

In this sequel to the excellent Circle of Magic series, four years have passed since her previous adventures, and a now teenaged Sandry has graduated to magehood and returned to the side of her ailing uncle.  What she doesn't expect however, is to find another young mage hopeful, posessing a highly unusual form of magic. And as if that wasn't enough, to then be told by the mage council that, since there are no readily available teachers possesing this boy's unique form of magic, she herself must become young Pasco Acalon's teacher.  This book promises excellent character development, a strong engaging plot, and plenty of action scenes.  However, those of you hoping for more of the hilarious interactions between Sandry and her other young mage partners will be dissapointed; Daja, Tris, and Briar are completely absent here.  Even so, this book's good points definitely outweigh it's one complaint; Pasco is a likable, charming character who reminded me pleasantly (though not reduntantly) of Briar.  Anyone who loved the Circle of Magic series should check this series out.	2002-07-25

The characters continue to mature, the storyline gets more intense, and everything SEEMS to be working towards a solid and satisfying conclusion. The problem? It wasn't the ending! After twelve books in which we see four normal, disfunctional kids gradually become cunning warriors and rise above their shallow, idiotic real world selves, everything seems to be going along fine at the beginning, and it's only in the last chapter or so we gradually become sinkingly aware that we are about to be cheated.  There are also countless little plot threads that the author didn't bother to resolve, the biggest of all being, WHAT HAPPENED WITH KA ANOR??!! Am I just supposed to go on with life now, not knowing? Also, what's going to happen with Christopher and Etain? Will she still have to marry Baldwin or will Christopher snatch her away somehow? What about April and Jalil? Were they even a potential couple or was I just seeing things? All these questions will never be answered, which I find endlessly frustrating, now I almost wish I hadn't read the series.  I certainly won't be reading any of the author's other ones, for fear of being let down the same way.  Even so, if you can ignore all the loose ends left behind at the conclusion (though how that would be possible I won't even hazard a guese), the series truly is good, recommendable to all teenagers.	2002-07-18

Former street rat, Briar, now lives easily at Winding Circle Temple, learning to be a mage, amoung his friends and those who care for him.  Even so, when one of his old companions calls him, begging magical help for a strange illness she's suffering, Briar (being the kind and helpful boy that he is) cannot refuse.  But when the girl's disease proves beyond even the power of Briar's powerful teacher, Rosethorn, the truth is out; a plague is on the loose.  And so begins a powerful and heartrending adventure, where once again our favorite four mages in training work together, defeating evil.  Except this time the question remains far more serious; will Brair be able to rise above his darker past to save the one he loves most?  This book is undisputedly the best in the series, especially since it centers around Briar, my favorite of the young mages.  It would serve as a stand alone book, but I'd recommend reading the previous three first anyway.  Not much happens in the first two, but the third is almsot as good as this one.	2002-07-13

Definitelly improving over the last two as far as plot and exciting things going on, this one also builds on each of the characters, while Daja takes center stage.  This book picks up with the four kids (with their respective teachers) on a journey to Goldridge Valley, where severe drought has caused rampant wildfires and many other problems.  While practicing her metelwork, Daja (with accidental help from Sandry, Tris, and Briar) creates a bizarre vine, made of 'living metel' that only pure magic can shape properly.  Daja's former people, the Traders, try to buy it from her, even though now they consider her Trangshi, a person so full of bad luck that no decent person can ever speak to her or deal with her.  Even so, being around them again reminds Daja of the family she lost, and makes her long for the way things used to be, and soon she'll have to make a choice; return with the Traders and give up the metelworking she loves, or remain with her beloved teacher and friends, and dispare of ever being a true Trader again.  Anyway, this book has charm, humour, warmth, and excitement.  For anyone looking for a great fantasy read, this book is the answer.	2002-07-10

No complicated plot to digest, no complex characters to think about, everything completelly laid out for you from the beginning, and no mystery whatsoever.  For a well read teenager, however, it was quite tedious.  Rather than just developing his main character, and giving me some reason to like and admire her, the author simply assumes I will no matter what, without any backround whatsoever.  Rather than creating a vibrant fantasy world and atmosphere for the story to take place in, the author neglects this aspect so completelly that I felt like I was walking around with a blind fold on.  Despite all this however, the story was fairly worth it, and little kids will love it.	2002-07-01

What made this book special was actually what originally gave the series it's charm, and what's been missing for several books.  The hilarious interactions between the main characters!  At times I was laughing out loud!  Anyway, David narrates this time as the kids try to make their way back to Olympus by tagging along with a few Romans on their ship.  A storm strikes suddenly, courtesy of Neptune, the angry Roman god of oceans, and when their boat sinks out from under them, they find themselves in the middle of Atlantis, caught in a war between Neptune and Poseidon.

As the five kids make their way into Egypt, hoping to find Senna's mother, instead they're captured by a large group of Amazons who have conquered the land...  I won't say anything else to avoid spoiling the story, buy truly, this one is the best so far.  Senna isn't a character I expected to hear from, but somehow, getting inside her twisted head for the first time, it was hard not to identify with her, and sympathize with her at least a bit.  Prior to this book, I despised Senna, but now she just might be my favorite.  Also, the Amazons as well were simply above cool!  Nothing like some good strong females to make a story more exciting.  Anyway, this book was great, and I recommend it to anyone who's been following the series.  These books don't stand well on their own, and you'd be hopelessly lost otherwise.	2002-06-29

Young Boba Fett is an excellently defined character, and the author was so good that it wasn't uncomfortable at all following someone so young.  I could easily identify with him.  The story follows him from Episode 2 onward, and it begins on Kamino, Boba's home planet.  Boba has no friends, no mother, and has never been to school, and there is little to do on his miserable, rainy, world except read, especially when his father and Zam are off on their frequent adventures.  However, when a mysterious Jedi shows up at their door, everything changes for Boba, fast.  Anyway, I recommend this book to any Star Wars fan with an open mind, young or old.	2002-06-28

If you're a kid under 13 or so, or even someone older with an extremelly small budget, this one's for you.  However, if it's a large story, and expanded scenes and dialogue you want, read the adult's version.  After reading them both, I have to say I enjoyed that one more, though this one was a welcome treat as well.  The characters are extremelly well defined, I truly could identify with all of them, Anakin especially, at certain parts.  So, a good book for any Star Wars fan.	2002-06-28

If anything, it's far better than the first one, with a lot more stuff happening, and the characters well fleshed out. Still, if it's an action filled fantasy thriller you're looking for, you won't find it here. This is a mainly character driven story without a lot of different things going on at once. Anyway, pirates have begun attacking Winding Circle in the aftermath of the devestating earthquake, while Tris's cousin Aymery appears, with a message from the family who rejected and ignored Tris, begging her to return to the side of her dying father. I won't say anything else to avoid spoiling the story, but trust me, this is a great book, good for kids of all ages, particularly the 9 to 12 age range.  Older kids may feel a bit cheated reading a book about a bunch of ten year olds, but the author's skill got me over it quickly and I urge any fan of Tamora Pierce, young or old, to give this series a try.	2002-06-25

Along the way they have plenty of problems of their own, mostly revolving around Senna, who we're pretty sure now is at least a partial enemy.  Jalil has a few real world difficulties as well (such as getting a date, hee hee).  The characters are real as ever, and the discriptions vivid as always, but as a warning to those younger than fourteen or so, this one is also exceptionally gory, even more so than usual.	2002-06-25

The series seems to get better with each book, and this one in particuler has to be my favorite so far.  Here, the kids find themselves on Olympus amoung the gods, having been summoned in the last book, to help fight Ka Anor and his Hetwan, who are holding Olympus (which also happens to be one of the last strongholds against them) at siege.  April, (my favorite) tells the tale once again, as she also has to struggle against real world problems of her own.  The exciting storyline, the compelling and interesting characters, and the vivid setting really contributed to this book's coolness, but really, what made the whole story for me was the inclusion of all the Greek mythology!  The author obviously did her homework here, really bringing the Gods to life.  I wouldn't recommend this series to litte kids, to the often intense violence and gore, and I'd also recommend reading all the books in order; they don't stand well on their own and you'll be hopelessly confused otherwise.	2002-06-24

The characters are extremelly well defined and developed, and I find myself liking all of them, even Christopher, more and more.  The author herself has an almost bizarre understanding of teenagers, and she writes it just like it is.  Anyway, in book six, the point of view swings back to Christopher, and he tells the tale as the four kids travel across Hetwan country, at the center of which is the inevitable Ka Anor, God Eater.  They are soon joined by Dionysis, Greek god of wine, and his unbearably handsome young cup-bearer, Ganymeade, who convince them to accompany them to Olympus.  Christopher's real world dilemma was interesting as well, but that would be a spoiler and a rather ironic one at that, so I will leave you to read the book yourself to find out the rest.  These books are pretty intense, so I can't say I'd recommend them to anyone younger than thirteen or fourteen or so.	2002-06-23

While teengage fans (such as myself) of Pierce's other fantasy quartets may find this series a bit jeuvenile and unexciting at first, for a series aimed at twelve years olds, it's definitely worth while.  True, not a lot happens in this first one, but what makes the book truly special is the excellently developed characters, the way the author is able to make you care about them right away.  And the subsequent books do get better.  The book centers around a place called Winding Circle Community, where the magically gifted young come to learn to use their inherrent powers and become future 'mages'.  It follows four children brought to Winding Circle, each under different circumstances, and coming from vastly different backrounds.  There's Sandry, of course, a spoiled, though basically good hearted rich girl, longing to do things for herself; Briar, a street rat, lacking even a last name and on his way to a short life of hard labor for being caught three times as a theif; Daja, a recently orphaned Trader girl, fascinated with the metel workings forbidden to her people; and Tris, an angry, deeply wounded girl, shunned and ignored by her family, and possessing an intense connection with the weather.  Each quickly become misfits or loners in the community, and gradually, we see them start to become friends.  I won't say anything else, to avoid spoiling the story, but trust me, read this one, and then the rest of the series, and you won't be sorry you did.  My one minor gripe was the rather misleading title.  Sandry's Book.  Naturally you'd assume this one would focus mostly on Sandry, not the case however.  Briar and Daja are the main focuses here.	2002-06-21

After several incomprehensively stupid moves on the part of the series creaters, (the death of Anakin Solo comes to mind) I was starting to feel rather depressed about the whole thing.  I still eagerly awaited each new book, but I also dreaded the consequences of the events in them.  This book, while still carrying out the series' dark storyline beatifully, also manages to convey a sense of comfort and lighthearted fun that's been missing for a while.  I still miss Anakin, but I can see now something I couldn't before this book; the Star Wars universe can live without him.  Jacen is still nowhere to be seen, but anyone who still thinks he's dead can't have been paying attention to the indications otherwise.<br />  There are three main storylines of the book, the first and possibly most important being Luke and Mara's mission to Vong occupied Coruscant.  The strange tension that seemed to be between Luke and Mara in Rebel Dream is gone here as well, and I was pleased to see that author made an honest effort to get Mara's character right this time.  As for the mission itself, just seeing the capitol world so ruined is chilling by itself, never mind what they find there.  Tahiri is in her element as well, finally coming out of her \\"whimpering weakling\\" phase she was in for a while after Anakin died.<br />  The second storyline centers around Han and Leia, comfortable with each other once again, though still deeply grieving for their youngest son, as they try to inspire resistance against the Vong.  <BR>  <BR>  Jaina is still a key character in her own storyline, (the defense of Borleias), though less so now, as other characters begin to take center stage.  She's mostly recovered from the dark compulsions of the dark side, though still determined to make the Vong pay for her little brother's untimely death.  Jaina and Jag are apparently considered a true couple now, and there is some romantic interaction between the two.  Being a Zekk fan myself, I found this repulsive and annoying, but those of you who prefer Jagged will probably enjoy this aspect of the book.  <BR>  Altogether, I'll say I can say happily that I greatly enjoyed this one, and eagerly await Traitor and (hopefully) Jacen's return.	2002-06-04

Anyone who loved Jedi Apprentice, and even those of us who didn't (yeah right, is there anyone who didn't adore those books?) should definitely, definitely check out this new series!  More like an extension of Jedi Apprentice than anything else, it's already at least as good as that series was at it's height.  Anakin Skywalker is now fourteen years old, and has been apprenticed to Obi-Wan Kenobi for several years (duh).  Even at this age, Anakin is more than a handful, almost more than Obi-Wan can handle, and we can already see the seeds of many of their later problems sewn.  Because of his brilliance and his intense connection to the living Force, everything has come easily to Anakin, and his abilities have taken him far above other students of his age, which has earned him grudging respect from teachers and students alike, but few if any, real friends.  This doesn't seem to bother introverted  Anakin too much, but Obi-Wan privately worries about his padawan, who has grown from a cheerful and open child, to a quiet and disturbed young man.  The council decides to send them on a rather complicated mission to a planet plagued by a toxic disaster, where they will have to work with three other master-padawan teams, including Siri Tachi (whom most of us remember from Jedi Apprentice) and her padawan Ferus, whom Anakin doesn't get along with too well.  Anyway, to avoid spoiling the story I won't say anymore, but trust me, these are definitely worth the time you spend reading them.  For fans of all ages.	2002-05-05

Doubtless any Star Wars fan will find this book as fun, informative and entertaining as I did.  I have the earlier edition as well, and while it was good in it's time, it became hideousely out of date quickly, and a new edition was definitely needed.  I'd definitely say that this fantastic book is the best of the Essential Guides period; the author's clear, straightford, and unbiased tone are what really gives the book it's charm.  Many of the minor inconsistensies between the novels are easily explained away here as well.  And of course the illustrations.  WOW!!!  They certainly picked the right guy for this job; everyone is perfect, just how I imagined them.  Among my favorites were Mara (deadly yet beautiful), Jacen (Wow, who ever guessed he'd be that cute), and Tsavong Lah (delightfully hideous).  My only minor gripe is that a few characters, such as Callista for example, who hasn't even been MENTIONED in eight or nine years, kept a spot in the actual book, whereas a key character in the New Jedi Order such as Tenel Ka, or Jagged Fel were reduced to the \\"other persons of note\\" section in the back.  Being that I despise Callista (always have always will) and adore Tenel Ka this irritated me enough that I took off a star for it.  Desipite this however, I definitely recommend this book for any Star Wars fan, young or old.  It would probably help if you have a fairly well read backround in the Expanded Universe, but this one promises to be entertaining even to amateur fans.  Oh, also worthy of note, major AOTC spoilers in this one.	2002-05-04

I was also pleased to see the return of a good author like Foster to the Star Wars universe.  The book serves as a bit of a 'set-up' for the political situation in Episode 2, as well as a way to define the characters of Anakin and Obi-Wan, and it accomplishes these goals well, if little else.  In this book, the rather backwater planet of Ansion has become a focal point in the increasingly shaky Republic; it's thinking of seceding, which could ultimately lead to war.  The Council sends two Jedi teams there to try to straighten things out, Obi-Wan and a now eighteen-year-old Anakin, and Luminari Unduli and her young padawan, Bariss Offee.  The book's focus is mainly the characters and relationships between the four Jedi, as they work towards a collective goal against seemingly impossible odds, and try their best to get along.  All the characters were portrayed well, but Anakin especially really struck home.  This is one author who remembers what it's like to be a teenager!  Anyway, if your a fan of the prequels (and who isn't?) definitely check this one out, but if action and battles is your main thing, you'll most likely find this one rather tedious.	2002-05-01

Fans older than twelve or so may feel that this book was a bit below par, and I'd definitely say that the adult's novelization was better, but really, this one is worth picking up, die hard fans or not.  The two books complement one another well, and if you have the spare time I'd recommend reading both.  Anyway, in this one, the characters were well fleshed out, especially Padme/Amidala and Anakin.  In the movie, I found it impossible to relate to Anakin even on a remote level, but here, seen through Padme's caring, protective eyes, he seems outright adorable, and through his own, I could see him as a real person, and made the story in general more enjoyable.  So, if you've seen the movie, I definitely recomend either or both of the novelazations.	2002-04-27

Sure, at times the writing style was a little bland and the supporting characters a bit formulaic, but for me, the amount of emotional development in the main characters of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and the quickly moving, descriptive plot completely made up for it. Many found this book in particular too reminiscent of earlier ones, particularly the whole Melida/Daan disaster. But I thought that having Obi-Wan reflect back on the horrors he saw there, and the huge rift between himself and Qui-Gon back then, made the similarities haunting rather than tedious, and added a heightened sense of drama to the overall story. It also showed how much Obi-Wan's matured over the past few years, in his willingness to never let anything like that happen again. Anyway, in this book Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are sent on a mission to Vorzyd 4, a planet on the edge of war with it's neighbor, Vorzyd 5, whom they are certain are the culprits of the resent terrorist attacks on their cities. As soon as they get there however, it's clear that everything is not as it seems... At the same time, Qui-Gon is beginning to become aware of the fact that Obi-Wan is growing up, and that the time they have left together is short, and this pains him terribly. Anyway, this is definitely a must for those of you who've been following the series. There is one more book after this, another split \\"special edition\\" adventure that features first Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, and then later Obi-Wan and a young Anakin. Here's to that one being even better!	2002-04-21

While not the best in the series, this one was definitely \\"worthy\\".  A different sort of plot than the usual, which was refreshing, and while the character developments were less than usual, I didn't really feel that this detracted from the story at all.  This book begins with an eighteen (or thereabouts) year old Obi-Wan still apprenticed to Qui-Gon several years before Episode 1.  The Jedi Council has recieved disturbing rumers of a possible Sith Holocron, floating around somewhere, and they immediately dispatch Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to find it at all costs.  To avoid spoiling the story, I'll just say that almost nothing goes as planned, and the story abrubtly skips forward ten years; when a much older Obi-Wan now trains his own apprentice, thirteen year old Anakin Skywalker.  To be honest, this was the first book I've read so far where I found myself liking and relating to Anakin's character at all.  Most of the other books have portrayed him either as a whiny baby, or just your basic budding darksider.  In this book, however, I could finally see him as a real person, much, much cooler as a teenager than a little kid.  Anyway, if you've been following the series than this one is a must.  Here's to the new Jedi Quest series being as good as Jedi Apprentice was!	2002-04-21

First of all, I'll say that few of the New Jedi Order books have managed to convey what this book did even in it's first few chapters; emotion, powerful relationships, heart-pounding action sequences, all the while keeping with and expanding on the complex overall plot of the series.  <BR>  <BR>  The book backtracks slightly, opening about two-thirds of the way through Dark Journey, which was fine with me, since that book focused so singly on Jaina and her personal angst that I tended to lose the big picture in my mind.  Rest assured, Allston is a terrific author, perhaps the best yet, and he definitely shows his talents in this one.  While much of the attention is still reserved for Jaina, it also gives a sweeping, overall look at the whole war, which isn't looking good for our heroes at present.  Anakin Solo, one of the best hopes for victory, is dead; Jacen is captured and presumed dead by just about everyone except his mother, Leia.  Jaina, torn by grief and rage over the death of her brothers is off fighting her own demons; and the Yuuzhan Vong have finally taken the capitol, the crowning jewel of the galaxy, Coruscant.  Luke and Mara are becoming increasingly protective of their infant son, which makes them both less useful as leaders to the Jedi.  <BR>  <BR>  Luke, desperate to do something to make the galaxy safer for his son to grow up in, decides to take on a near suicide mission to Coruscant, both to investigate a strange and frightening infestation of the dark side there, and to confirm whether or not Jacen is still alive, and if so to free him, or die trying.  <BR>  The government is in shambles, our heroes are dying, and the Vong now have the majority of the galaxy.  Even so, despite the ominous and painful direction the series is taking, Allston still lightens it from time to time with slight inflections of humor.  Barely noticeable, but there.  While I never caught myself laughing out loud like I did over some of his X-Wing books, it lightened this dark tale considerably, and kept it from depressing me out of my mind the way Star by Star did.  <BR>  <BR>  Also, thanks to the author for making Tahiri a mildly interesting character again.  After Star by Star (when she played the typical jealous teenage girlfriend, Ugh) and Dark Journey (the whining weeping mourner everyone feels sorry for) I was really starting to dislike her, but this book restored her in my relative favor.  Jaina as well was better here, instead of being portrayed as she usually is (the sort of bratty teenage daughter that's every parent's nightmare, determined to bring her parents to early graves) but rather, we finally see the true warrior that she is; the better halves of both her parents, as she wages phsycological warfare on the Vong, determined to make them pay for hurting her brothers.  <br />  Even so, some parts of this book really did annoy me, hence my four star rating. First and foremost is the lack of Jacen-action. How long are they going to keep us in limbo like this? Bring him back or kill him permanently, and soon.  If they don't intend to let him be rescued yet, at least let us see what they're doing to him in captivity. The suspence is killing me! <br />  Also, what has happened to Mara? Where is the toughness, the dark humor, the inner strength and vitality that made her so endearing in the first place? Yes, I realize that now that she is a mother she needs to start putting her child first; especially in the middle of a horrible war, but that doesn't have to mean she should suddenly dissolve into a complete weakling, I mean, was there a scene in this book when she was not holding Ben?  As for her relationship with Luke, I won't even go there.  They need to give her something of her own to do, besides wiping her baby's rear.  <br />  Third, I really disliked the Jaina/Jag developments in this book. Of course, anyone who's read the Dark Tide dualogy could see this coming a mile away, but it still bothers me. Of course, I'm probably biased on this subject, since, being a long time fan of Young Jedi Knights I always thought Jaina should end up with Zekk. But really, it isn't that I don't like Jag, in fact I've gotten to be quite fond of him, I just think he's all wrong with Jaina.  Jag is a rule follower; a by the books, take-your-hat-off-inside, Yes Ma'am kind of guy.  Jaina is adventurous, a risk taker, most of the time not bothering to think of the consequences of her actions before she makes them, and frankly I think Jag would bore her out of her mind in a week, and her constant heedless recklessness would drive him insane.  Much as I hate to say it, even Kyp would be better. :-(  Oh, well.  For fans of the series, this book won't disapoint you.	2002-04-14

If you found the movie in any way disapointing, and even if you didn't, read this book!  It's way better than the movie, which, while enjoyable was also confusing at some points, and I found it very difficult at times to connect with the characters.  Not so with this book.  Anakin especially was well done; I found him extremely annoying when I watched the movie, but here not only can we finally see what makes him so special, but we can even relate to him.  Qui-Gon as well is much better portrayed here, and his relationship to Obi-Wan is better understood as well.  The only character I felt could have been better was Padme/Amidala.  The author was so intent on keeping us in the dark over who is who, that up until Padme reveals herself to Boss Nass as Queen Amidala we see her only through Anakin's adoring eyes and Qui-Gon's slightly disdainful ones.  Until close to the end of the book nothing is from her point of view, which doesn't leave much room for fleshing out her character.  Besides this however, I can say I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, especially those dissapointed with how the movie turned out.  A testement to how good this book is is that, for a moment or two, I even felt sympothy for Jar Jar!	2002-04-06

Anyway, this book is unique to the others in several ways, the most interesting of which as that for once it is almost entirely focuses on political menuevering, and that it only focuses on four of the rogues; Wedge, Janson, Hobbie, and Tycho.

Stackpole returns to the series in this book, to at last wrap up the whole Isard storyline that's been going on since the beginning of the series.  It takes place right at the end of the Thrawn trilogy, and gets us reintroduced to characters such as Corran and Mirax, now married, Iella, who's become totally cool in the last few books, and Isard herself, thought dead, but truly alive, and commanding the Imperial fleets once again in Thrawn's permanant absence.  Thankfully, however, the main focus centers around Wedge rather than the insufferably arrogant Corran.  Wedge is finally forced to accept the general's commision he's turned down three times, but Ackbar makes it so he can still command his beloved Rogue Squadron, and even fly with them most of the time.  If you've been following the series, this one is a must, otherwise, you won't get most of what is going on.	2002-03-28

The first four books of the X-wing series were definitely good, and I enjoyed reading them, but there was undeniably something missing from the characters; which seemed just a bit to clichiey and wooden, and the action sequences; there was simply too many of them!  This book made it all worthwhile!  Rather than chapter upon chapter of nothing but fight scenes, the author balances the action with the characters perfectly.  At first I thought it would be impossible to adjust to a whole new cast of characters after just getting used to the others, but the author got past this potential awkwardness almost flawlessly, and I quickly found myself drawn to each of the Wraiths, as much or more, than I was to the Rogues.  Anyway, after years of Commanding Rogue Squadron, the most elite group of X-wing pilots in the New Republic, Commander Wedge Antilles is given a daunting assignment by Admiral Ackbar: turn a talanted band of mis-fits and screw-ups into a formidable fighting force, or be forced to accept a General's commision he doesn't want.  He needs to turn this group into a new, but less visable elite squadron, Wraith Squadron.  His new soldiers include (of all things) a brilliant Gamorrean, a giant, a former child actor, a bothan, and plenty of other wonderfully strange (and lovable) characters.  So, I'd definitely say this is the best one yet, and I simply can't wait to get to the next one!  The thing with Kell and Tyria was cute, and I was rooting for them to get together, but it would have been much  better if they'd waited until book six or seven, or even the very end of this one, to actually get them together.  Sticking it in the middle like that not only makes no sense, but also makes both of them seem a bit...easy.  Anyway, this book was great and I recomend it to all Star Wars fans, especially those who've been following the series.	2002-03-21

This has been, overall, a great series, and this book was one of the best.  Tieing up most of the loose ends, (Isard, Mirax and Corran, etc) it also didn't shy away from showing some of the best character interactions I've seen yet, which really made me care about these characters.  On a lesser note, we finally get to find out where Bacta comes from!  I've been reading the New Jedi Order for a while, so I know what happens to Corran later in life, but still, I was very pleased, if not surprised, by his devopments in this book.  I'd recommend this series mostly to teenagers and adults, due to some adult themes.  Besides that though, this book was highly enjoyable and I look forward to the next one!	2002-03-17

Definitely an improvement over the first, this second book is fast paced without compromising the characters, full to the brim with action, and heartfelt as well, focusing on a wider spectrum of characters, from Wedge to Corran to the young Gavin Darklighter. The plot is a little simplistic, and the battle scenes a bit forced, but oddly enough it didn't seem to matter since this was mainly a book for character development. For those of you who've been following the &quot;mainstream&quot; expanded universe novels this one (and the entire series) should be particularly interesting, not only showing what was happening in the galaxy during this neglected three or four year period, but also giving interesting insights into how the rest of the galaxy, the &quot;normal&quot; people, see Luke, Han, Leia and the rest. This book also helped me to gain interest in Corran Horn, I character I previousely despised. Anyway, I won't spoil the plot for you, but if you like Star Wars, and action, than this series is for you.	2002-03-16

Sure, at times the writing style was a little bland and the supporting characters a bit formulaic, but for me, the amount of emotional development in the main characters of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and the quickly moving, discriptive plot completely made up for it.  Many found this book in particuler too reminiscent of earlier ones, particulerly the whole Melida/Daan disaster.  But I thought that having Obi-Wan reflect back on the horrers he saw there, and the huge rift between himself and Qui-Gon back then, made the similarities haunting rather than tedious, and added a hightened sense of drama to the overall story.  It also showed how much Obi-Wan's matured over the past few years, in his willingness to never let anything like that happen again.  Anyway, in this book Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are sent on a mission to Vorzyd 4, a planet on the edge of war with it's neighbor, Vorzyd 5, whom they are certain are the culprits of the resent terrorist attacks on their cities.  As soon as they get there however, it's clear that everything is not as it seems...  At the same time, Qui-Gon is beginning to become aware of the fact that Obi-Wan is growing up, and that the time they have left together is short, and this pains him terribly.  Anyway, this is definitely a must for those of you who've been following the series.  There is one more book after this, another split \\"special edition\\" adventure that features first Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, and then later Obi-Wan and a young Anakin.  Here's to that one being even better!	2002-03-11

The best yet	By book three, this series is in full swing; the main characters have been introduced and developed, the continuing war against the Empire is being fought, and Coruscant has been taken!  This book is where the author really shows his stuff, balancing characters, relationships, battles, action and death perfectly.  I had read I, Jedi some time before this, so as far as Corran's situation went I already knew the outcome, but the amount of tension and fear for his life that I felt was amazing despite this.  Though some of it was a bit far-fetched, (Corran Horn, the barely known Rogue Squadron pilot and former cop is suddenly everyone's best friend and the martyr of the galaxy? Spare me) the book was still excellent.  Since I've been following the New Jedi Order for quite some time, I've gotten used to Gavin as the kind, middle-aged, father figure type squadron leader, and I found it quite entertaining to see him here as the young, inexperienced sixteen-year old scared little boy, \\"taken care of\\" by his squadronmates.  Anyway, this book was great and I recommend it to any true Star Wars fan.	2002-03-10

Like many other reviewers I did not think this book was in the top catagory of Star Wars books.  Not by a long shot.  However, if you're a devoted fan, I definitely recommend you read the others, because with each book the author seems to get better.  Anyway, this book takes place about two and a half years after Return of the Jedi, which is cool, since none of the others books cover this time period, and blank spots like this annoy me.  Rather than yet another tale about Luke, Han and Leia fighting evil as usual, the focus in this series is on the members, old and new, of the legendary elite fighter squadron, Rogue Squadron.  Wedge Antilles, now squadron leader, is a main character, but unfortunately the main focus of the book (and ultimately the source of many of it's problems) is a character I find somewhat annoying, Corran Horn.  Sure, he's a nice guy at heart, but on the surface he's arrogant, self-centered, blood-thirsty, and prejudiced.  And yet he is still lucky enough to have TWO love interests, Erisi; a well meaning slut, and Mirax Terrik; the beloved daughter of a man his father despised.  Yes, I realize law inforcement officers see terrible stuff and get hard pretty quick, like Corran.  Yes, I realize it must have been horrible to watch his father shot down in the street, but let's face it, these things don't have a lot to do with the current storyline, so why continually dwell on them?  Giving a new character such extensive baggage right in the beginning seems like a bad idea to me.  Anyway, besides Corran I found many of the other characters stereotypical and difficult to relate to as well, excepting the few bright spots of Wedge, Tycho Celcu, and Mirax Terrik.  So, all in all, I'd say while this one isn't the best, the rest of the series makes up for it.  If you're die-hard fan, and/or an action freak, you'll love this series.  I wouldn't recommend this one to little kids either, because of the extensive violence and mild sexual inuendo.	2002-03-09

Books one and two were good, but this final installment of the trilogy is definitely it's crowning glory.  Before this series, I never thought of Han as being deep, or even really that interesting, but from the moment I began the series, I was as engrossed in his early life as if it were mine.  This one in particuler drew me into his character, though without compromising the flow of the plot, or the heartstopping action sequences.  Anyway, this book spans over a longer time period as well, (five years?) taking us all the way to the moment he enters the Mos Eisley cantina in A New Hope.  As for the plot, I can't bring myself to spoil it for you, and if you've read the first two, this one is a must.  Any Star Wars fan would love this series.	2002-03-09

The second book in Han Solo's saga is nearly as brilliant as the first, with a solid, interesting, believable plot; good, well developed characters, and well described settings.  It begins a couple of years after the first one ended, after Han's parted ways (thank God) with the first great love of his life, Bria Theran.  In that time, however, he's managed to get taken into the Imperial Academy for fleet commanders, and then kicked out into the street again for one trick to many; this time rescuing the enslaved wookie, Chewbaaca.  Now, with no ship, no job, no girlfriend, and an ecstaticly grateful wookie, Han's lost everything he worked his life to attain, and through it all, he begins to find his identity as a smuggler.  One thing that annoyed me though, was the book's rather akward starting point.  What was Han's life like while he was in the academy?  How did he rescue Chewbaaca?  To me, this left a huge gap in the story, interupting the smooth flow of the overall trilogy.  Despite this minor fault, all in all I'd definetely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, particulerly those who love Han Solo (duh).  This one is definitely not for little kids though, on account of the often intense violence.	2002-02-23

The book is well written, has breathtaking scenery and brutal fight scenes, as well as delving deep into Han's character, perhaps more than any book has done before.  I thoroughly enjoyed this one, even though Han was never one of my apsolute favorite characters, this book nearly changed all that, and I actually found myself identifying with him!  Anyway, Han is a lost, lonely  street kid barely scraping together a living in the hellish undercities of Corellia.  When finally, he's found by Garris Shrike, a man willing to pay with food and a bed for the thieving and pick-pocketing skills Han's had to use to survive, how can he refuse?  Once he's nineteen however, Han is more than eager to free himself of Shrike and get a real job somewhere, even if it means leaving behind his good friend Dewlanna, a female wookie who loved and cared for Han like a son once he came to work for Shrike. (enter Han's chronic affection for wookies!)  As soon as he escapes, Han struggles to get to Elysia, the only place who will have him as a pilot, and there he meets Bria Theran...  I can't bring myself to spoil the rest of the plot, but believe me, it's definitely worth it if you're a Star Wars fan.  Like some other readers, I thought the religious cult was stupid, as was the whole Bria storyline.  All Bria, this supposedly strong woman does in this book is cry and cling to Han.  I mean really!  It's like Callista all over again! (I'm sure many of you know what I mean) Why even bother building up all this utterly sappy Romeo and Juliet stuff when everyone KNOWS that it isn't going to work out, one way or another, because Han has to be free to fall in love with Leia (who just for the record would be about eight years old at this point in time) in about ten years.  Even so, while I felt these things detracted from the story enough to make me take away that fifth star itprobably deserved, I still greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to just about any Star Wars fan.  Side note though, this one is not for young kids, on account of the often intense graphic violence and sexual inuendo.	2002-02-16

The plot was a little less complicated than usual, and the emphasis was definitely focused on the characters, but I actually found that refreshing.  Also, this book wasn't meant to be an epic, just a quick, one book adventure, giving Qui-Gon time to at last come to terms with Tahl's death, and repair his relationship and trust with Obi-Wan, and it accomplished these goals very well. Anyway, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan haven't been on a mission in months, because Qui-Gon is still deep in mourning over Tahl, so much so that he even feels burdoned by Obi-Wan's presence.  The Force couldn't save the one he loved, so how can he constantly tell his apprentice to trust in it?  Finally, the Council gets tired of waiting around for Qui-Gon to come to his senses by himself, so they decide to send him and Obi-Wan on a mission whether they like it or not, a fairly easy one that involves protecting beautiful young widow Lena as she makes her way to Coruscant to testify against her husband's potential murderer. When they get there however, Lena informs them that she really has no evidence to convict, but she desperately needs their protection from the numerous foes in her dead husband's crime lord family.  Qui-Gon wants to leave immediately and let her fend for herself, but ever soft-hearted Obi-Wan (who seems to have developed a bit of a \\"crush\\" on Lena) begs him to let them stay and watch out for her while she collects evidence, and he reluctantly agrees. It's then that things start turning strange... Anyway, like I said this book isn't one of best in the series, but it does clear the ice for the next one, which unfortunately is the final book in this exceptional series.	2002-02-14

For the rest of us, I'd say read a whole bunch of the others first, then come back to these.  Though the stories are well written and easy to follow, they rely almost too heavily on action and have virtually no character development.  Even so, all three are quick, fun reads, definitely worth checking out, especially if you've been a fan for a while.  The trilogy basically tell of a few of Han and Chewie's adventures around five years (or thereabouts) before A New Hope, with plenty of shooting, killing, and all around fun.  For those of you to whom action is the most important thing, this trilogy is a real treasure indeed, but if you're looking for a more complex plot detailing Han's early life and such, I'd say read A.C. Crispan's more recently written Han Solo trilogy instead.	2002-02-11

Not only does it give complete, concise knowledge of just about anything Star Wars imaginable, it also supplies plenty of full color pictures and photos which add plenty of color.  The writing style of the author is serious and detailed, but also fun, so even a heavy reference book like this doesn't get dull.  The entries include everything from short bios of the main characters of the saga (Luke, Han, Leia, Mara etc...) to things like the names of the toys Jacen and Jaina played with when they were babies.  It's expensive, but trust me, it's well worth the money.  The downside?  It's also extremely outdated.  Nothing from at least the last five years of Star Wars chronology is included.  Not the New Jedi Order, certainly not any of the events from Specter or Vision.  Even so, the amount of knowledge this book offers is would be more than essential to any hard core Star Wars fan, despite it's rather dated approach.	2002-02-07

From the moment I picked it up, to twenty-three hours later when I finally finished it, I lived in the Star Wars universe.  The author really nailed just about all the characters perfectly, developed the plot quickly and efficiently, and all the while kept me on the edge of my seat from page one to three-hundred and one.  Star by Star was extremely, almost exheedingly dark, and while Dark Journey doesn't entirely abandon that thread, it's a bit lighter, faster paced, and folows up on the events of Star By Star very well, dealing not only with Anakin's death and Jacen's disappearance, but more importantly the surviving characters reactions to those things.  Dark Journey opens almost exactly where Star By Star ended, with the nine surviving members of the original Jedi strike team racing out from behind enemy lines in a stolen Vong ship that Jaina struggles to fly, while struggling with her own grief and guilt over her little brother's demise, as well as fear for her captured twin.  Because of a desperate need to make her brother's death mean something, Jaina is filled with a lust for revenge, that she is more than willing to use the Darkside to fulfill.  The interesting part of this aspect of the story is that in most Star Wars books when a character turns to the dark side it is portrayed as a terrible mistake, but here, even when Jaina is doing things like shooting dark side lighting out of her fingers, all of it is made to seem perfectly rational and even sensible; I know I would do the same thing if my brother was killed in front of me.  Anyway, come out of hyperspace near Coruscant, only to discover the terrible truth; the capitol world has been nearly destroyed by Vong attacks and the government is in shambles.  Jaina makes the descision to fly to Hapes instead, a temporary haven she deams safe because of Tenel Ka's status there.  What she doesn't take into acount, however, is the amount of malice and hatred that many Hapens still feel towards the Solos, on account of the destruction of the Hapen fleets at Fondor at Anakin's hand...  Anyway, I won't give away the rest of the plot, but I'll tell you right now, it's one heck of a ride!  However, if you're looking for major overall plot changes, you might as well just skip this one, since nothing really changes at all as far as the war goes, and this is primarily a character driven story, with many sweet touching scenes, but little progress.  We learn how much Jacen and Tenel Ka loved each other, but anyone who's read Young Jedi Knights knew that already.  We learn who Jaina really loves as well, (a MAJOR dissapointment for me) but really we that already as well.  Also, the previous generation has almost no part in this story.  Anyway, if you're into Star Wars and this series, I gaurentee you'll love this book.	2002-01-31

The book is organized very well, so finding what you're looking for is not difficult, and in each entry, after at least several long paragraphs describing what this particuler species eats, where it lives, breeding habits, etc, there is a short narrative from the point of view of a certain character (ranging anywhere from Luke Skywalker, to Bria Tharen, to Anakin Solo) describing a first hand experience with a member of the specified species.  This is the most unique (and hilarious) aspect of the book.  However, I would recommend this book mostly to highly experienced, (and highly devoted) Star Wars fans, though that is not to say that those of you who are not so &quot;into it&quot; couldn't pick it up for idle amusement.  Anyway, all in all I would say that this book is among the best Star Wars reference books I've read in a while, and one I would recommend to all major Star Wars fans.	2002-01-30

Many have complained of this books faults, and while I'll admit it certainly has it's share in them, I found it to be one of the most well balanced Star Wars books I'd read in a long while.  Yes, the characters are hard to get into at first, but they're also developed well enough over the course of the book that any half intelligent reader would come to like them anyway.  Yes, the plot is clichey, and the suspense of the Trade Federation part of the book ruined by the Phantom Menace, and yet along with the cliches are unexpected twists and turns, characters you come to care about, and an extremely unpredictable ending.  However, if you're looking for a deep and intracite story focusing on Darth Maul himself and the Sith way of life, this is not your book.  Only a few chapters are even from his point of view, and there is almost nothing about his early life and training.  Anyway, in this book, one of Nemoidians has escaped with key information, and Darth Sidious orders Maul to find and kill him.  An easy enough seeming task, but by the time Maul reaches the traitor, he's already let another in on his secret, Lorn Paven, information broker...  Meanwhile, Darsha Assant, a young Padawan, is finally ready to face the \\"trials\\" to ascend to knighthood at last.  The assignment she's given is particularely difficult, and in the course of it she encounters Lorn, and through a chain of hearstopping events, they are forced to work together.  I won't spoil the rest of the plot, but take my word for it, if you like Star Wars, and have at least a bit of an open mind, you will like this book.	2002-01-29

I definitely feel that this trilogy as an all deserves a full four stars, for, if nothing else, the pure enjoyment I got out of reading it. Isn't that what Star Wars books are for? While the writing style was not as great as many of the others, considering how early on it written, this author made surprisingly few continuity mistakes. How was he to know at this time that the word for a popular stimulative drink in the Star Wars universe is &quot;caf&quot; and not &quot;coffeine&quot;? However, if these small details really bother you, than stay away from this trilogy at all costs. As for the story, some parts of it are silly, but overall Lando was portrayed flawlessly, as was his irritating little companion. So,if you're an experienced Star Wars fan, and have read at least enough of the mainstream books to know the basic storyline, then yeah, these books are fun to read, but if you're just starting out, wait a while on these.	2002-01-28

Perhaps not as heartstoppingly nerve-bending as the previous one, but that being beside the point, the author has only gotten better with these books.  This one in particuler was not only deeply emotional, but also exciting enough so that I, (a very seasoned reader, I might add) would set aside everything else in my life no matter how important the moment it came into my hands, to the moment, an hour and a half later, that I finished it, to the point where half-way through I was finally grounded for reading instead of doing my chores and didn't even care!  This book begins only hours after the trying events of The Death of Hope, with a grief stricken Qui-Gon still unwilling to move from the side of his dead love, his childhood friend and fellow Jedi Knight, Tahl.  Since the Council is supposed to know immediately when a Knight is killed, Obi-Wan has to face them alone, and they are almost immediately joined by Mace Windu himself, and Bant, Obi-Wan's close childhood friend and Tahl's estranged Padawan, and together they immediately begin a search for Balog, Tahl's killer.  However, this is even more difficult, on account of the complicated turmoil this planet is undergoing, as well as an uncharacteristicaly emotional Qui-Gon, who, unwilling to wait for any justice the council might decide on, and unwilling to put up with Mace reprimanding him for the way his feelings for Tahl had deepened, (which, while not outright forbidden, is highly frowned upon in the Jedi order) goes off alone without even Obi-Wan to do something he's rather his sixteen year old padawan didn't see; Balog's murder.  Meanwhile, Obi-Wan, having figured out on his own that Qui-Gon and Tahl had become &quot;more&quot; than friends is deeply confused as well as hurt by his master's dissapearance, and over the also deeply distraught Bant's apparent rejection not only of his sympathies, but even the support of his friendship.  Anyway, all I can say is that this bookis great, focusing mainly on the characters, (which I always love!) but not lacking a deep and complicated plot as well.  Qui-Gon's predicament was nothing short of heartbreaking, and while I was well prepared for Tahl's death, (since she appeared nowhere in Episode 1 I knew she'd have to be dead by then) this knowledge made it no less painful, since she's been one of my favorite characters in this series ever since she was first introduced in book five.  Also interesting was Bant's cryptic comment to Obi-Wan as he struggled to console her, 'If your master was killed because you couldn't save him, than you'd know how I feel.'  Hmmm, hints hints.  Speaking of Bant, I'm immensely curious as to what's going to happen to her now.   We all know that the way the old order of Jedi worked, all force sensitive children were trained together at the temple until as early adolescents they could hopefully be chosen by a master for more personal one-on-one training, the only way a child could reach the full rank of Jedi Knight.  Those who weren't chosen by age thirteen or so were sent back home to parents they most likely hadn't seen since babyhood.  But what if you were chosen, but then suddenly half way through your training your master is killed?  You're too young and inexperienced to be declared a Jedi already, as Obi-Wan was at the end of the Phantom Menece, and yet possess to many developed talents to safely be sent home and have the secrets of the Jedi safe from the wrong hands.  What happens to you?  Can another master take you on out of pity?  I hope that this is something that's explored before the close of the series in two books time, because I really want to know!  Anyway, this is a great book that I recommend to Star Wars fans in general as well as long-time fans of the series.	2001-12-22
US	47867897	R3PKIZI5O72AI9	0345428641	501288398	Edge of Victory 1:  Conquest (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent follow-up to Balance Point...	Well, I'll admit that when I started this book, I wasn't expecting much. Mostly because I liked Balance Point a whole lot, and suspected that anything coming immediately after it would be eclipsed by it from birth. Man, was I wrong! While this book didn't have as large and diverse a cast of main characters, or anywhere near as complex a plot, the overall writing and style was definitely on a par with anything that came before it! The scene descriptions were breathtaking, the death of a certain character heartbreaking (at least if you've read Junior Jedi Knights), and the battle scenes nerve-bending, without being overly bloodthirsty (unlike some others I could mention). I am actually quite mystified at why some would say this book is no more than a glorified Young Jedi Knights novel. To me that's partly what made it so enjoyable, since it followed up on characters and events that were left hanging in that series, yet continuing the flow of this series without too many confusing things being thrown in at once.  The main focus of this book was Anakin Solo, which was cool, since he has always (from the day of his birth) been shunted aside and practically ignored at times in favor of his dynamic and outgoing brother and sister, and one can see how he's maturing.  Anyway, the Vong Warmaster has called for the heads of all the Jedi, (particularly Jacen's) saying that if all of the remaining Jedi are turned over to them, they will stop their viscous pummeling of New Republic forces. Unfortunately, many citizens of the New Republic, having been terrified into a frenzy, are dumb enough to believe the ultimatum, and so eagerly begin to hunt Jedi, while the fractitious New Republic government simply looks the other way. While they are treated like criminals and hunted like animals by those the Jedi Code says they are to protect, the Jedi are slowly coming apart at the seams. Kyp Durron insists that the only way to fight the Vong and the Peace brigade is to return aggression with aggression, but Luke, realizing that Kyp's real motive is his own grief and lust for revenge (most of the jedi that have been killed so far have been his close friends, including his own personal apprentice) maintains that that is of the Dark side, and that they must remain strong and peaceful, fighting only because they have no alternative and to defend themselves and their children.  Unfortunately however, a depressing number of Jedi are more than willing to listen to Kyp...  By this time however, the Vong have managed to get far enough into the galaxy that they are becoming a threat to Yavin 4, so Luke, realizing that the young students at the Jedi academy are in danger, sends Talon Kardde to go and get the children off the planet, fast, while he remains at the side of his own newly pregnant wife.  He gives direct orders to the Solo children (having learned their disappearing tricks by now) NOT to go there into the line of fire, but Anakin slips by him and races to the academy anyway, prompted by a disturbing vision of his best friend, Tahiri, in serious danger. He gets there in time to warn them, and they quickly rescue almost all the kids, except Anakin, Tahiri, Sannah ( also from Junior Jedi Knights), and Valin (Corran Horn's twelve year old son). Tahiri is soon captured, and despite this Anakin manages to get Valin and Sannah rescued, while he presses on alone to save his friend, all the while uncomfortably aware (through their force bond) of the things the Vong are doing to Tahiri...  Anyway, this was a great book, especially good for those of you who, (like me) were fans of the Junior Jedi Knights series.  I was quite pleased to see the return of Tahiri, especially since she was not a character I expected to see again, being that, while the nine and ten year olds who read and enjoyed Junior Jedi Knights (myself included) would now be old enough to read and understand this series, I doubt that the averedge adult reading this book would have any idea whatsoever who she is, but the author handled this generation block well, bringing her easily into the story, without throwing in too many confusing events and complications associated with her that would make some of us feel left out.  I also enjoyed the way he portrayed her character (remmember, she's five years older now), bringing out and emphasizing what was cool about her in the first place, and leaving out the annoying childlike giddiness she had in the other series, which, all in all, made her a better and deeper character.  So, in general, I liked this book a lot, and thought that it expanded well on the series, and brought out the characters well.  This book (and the rest of the series) would be great for anyone thirteen or so, all the way up to adults.	2001-12-11

Thirteen year old Marie Antooinete is a cheerful, naive, yet inwardly insightful girl, who's biggest problem is what dress to wear, yet, however it may sound, this book is truly quite fascinating, capturing the characte of Marie, as she may have been.  Since she was nine, she has known that her destiny is to marry the Dauphine of France and become their queen, yet as it draws closer, the thought of marrying begins to frighten her a bit.  In her mind, she comforts herself with thoughts of her handsome future husband, though when she meets him, she if horrified by his chubby, pimply exterier, only to discover he is as terrified as she is...  Anyway, this book is funny and melodramatic, and recomendable to anyone from about ten up to adults.	2001-11-17

Also, while most of the others begin with princess being around twelve or so, Isabel is already almost fifteen when the book begins, and is about eighteen by the end, which I also found refreshing, since, being almost sixteen, for once I was not made to feel like an old fogey.  Anyway, in this tale is full to the brim with palace intrigue, along with a well portrayed spanish flavor.  Isabel lives with her older brother, who is King, while secretely feeling favor for the true heir, her younger brother.  Meanwhile her older brother continually threatens to marry her off to disgusting old men in order to keep her in line, but Isabel's spirit does not flag, for she is determined to marry for love rather than convienience.  Anyway, this book is great, building one what I have always known; that history can be cool!  I recommend this book to anyone ten all the way up to adults.	2001-11-17

Well, I have to say that I was quite surprised at the fairly accurate picture of what Cleopatra might have been like at this age that this book so beautifully portrayed.  Since her death she has captured people's imaginations, and it's fairly obvious that the picture of her would get warped over time, but this book painted a very interesting picture of what the real Cleopatra might have been like, in a way that every twelve year old can relate to!  Though I'm a bit over the recommended age for these books (almost 16) I still find them fascinating, and I would definitely recommend this one in particular to people of all ages, since it reaches for the princess in all of us. In this book, young Cleopatra must leave her beloved Alexandria with her father to travel on a diplomatic mission to Rome, a \\"stinking city\\" as Cleopatra herself puts it.  Once there, she finds herself forced to deal with greater problems, such as her older sister seizing the throne in her father's absence, and the very real possibility that in his new paranoia he may decide to execute her as well, and if that wasn't enough, her father has also begun drinking again, humiliating himself and Cleopatra before the Romans more than once.  At the same time, she slowly comes to the realization that her two favorite servant are falling in love, while a certain twenty-six year old Roman sets his eyes on Cleopatra herself, causing mixed emotions in her thirteen year old mind... Anyway, this book is great, and while maybe not intirely historically accurate, succedes in bringing the ancient world to vivid life in a language we kids can understand.	2001-11-13

Well, I started reading this book on a day when I had absolutely nothing else to do, and was hooked from the first entry, even setting aside another book I was reading at the same time in favor of this one!  It takes us back to a beautifully painted picture of late mideaval England, seen through the eyes of Elizabeth, the lonely, yet strong willed princess whose greatest desire is to be loved by her neglectful father.  I found that I identified instantly with Elizabeth, and I enjoyed her character immensely, though fortunately I do not have to fear every moment being exiled.  As this tale filled with palace intrigue unfolds, I gaurentee you'll be as spell-bound as I was.  While it's short, (I finished it only a few short hours after I began it) it's sweet, and while I'd recommend it mostly to kids twelve and under, older people can love it too!	2001-11-12

First of all, I will state right now, free and clear that I possitively hated the choice of which character to kill (if you've read the book, you know who I mean, but if you haven't, I'm not about to spoil it for you).  However, as you can tell from my rating, I also refuse to let that color my opinion of the entire book, which was excellent besides that certain event.  I certainly don't blame the author, as it was not his decision to make anyway.  Besides that, what basically happens is that the Vong have released a new weapon called Voxyn, breeded from vornskyrs, and some other weird Vong plague stuff, to create a bio-super weapon, capable of hunting down and destroying the Jedi, one by one, since, weak as they are they still remain the galaxy's best hope for winning the war.  And then Jedi begin to fall.  If you've read Junior and Young Jedi Knights, some of the names of those killed may be familier.  Anakin Solo comes up with a sickeningly dangerous plan, involving sending a strike team to the heart of Vong occupied space, to destroy the Queen Voxyn, from which all the others are cloned.  Luke sees no other way to stop his Knights from being killed, so he reluctantly sends Anakin, Tahiri, Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, Lowie, Zekk, and about ten others on this mission, and almost instantly things begin to go wrong.  People die, tensions rise, childhood friendships are strained to the breaking point.  Meanwhile, Kyp finally decides to stop being a baby and returns with his squadron to the rest of the Jedi, telling Luke that he is ready to follow orders, which is good, because the Vong choose this moment to attack Coruscant, the very heart of New Republic government...  I'll say right here, that some of the events in this book seem to disturbingly echo things that are going on in real life right now, and if this will bother you, I strongly suggest you don't read it.  I was quite pleased to see Luke and Mara fighting together again, and one can see their relationship continue to grow.  As does Han and Leia's, if you Solo fans would stop whining and comparing them to Luke and Mara long enough to open your eyes and notice things like that.  That being beside the point, I definitely feel that Luke and Mara deserve some extra attention in this department, being that they are the ones just starting their family right now.  Anyway, as for the Solo children and their relationships, I was quite pleased to see Jacen and Tenel Ka hitting it off again; always figured she was the one for him, rather than that silly Danni Quee.  Whether both of them will survive the next couple of books though is another question, and one I'm not sure I want to know the answer to.  As for Jaina, I wish she would stop brushing Zekk off.  I always felt he was her soulmate, and if she doesn't end up with him than I fear she may be destined to wind up with Jag &quot;cold-fish&quot; Fel, or even worse, Kyp &quot;the purvert&quot; &quot;if you don't give me orders I want to follow, than I'll either leave, or do them my own way anyway&quot; Durron.  Anyway, moving back to the character death, (nope, still not gonna tell!) he died like the true hero he was, and while the decision to kill him, of all people at this time seems odd to me, I trust Del Rey to have had a reason that will be disclosed in the next couple of books.  The scene itself was heartbreaking, and far more emotional even then Chewbacca's death scene in Vector Prime.  It takes a lot for a book to make me truly emotional, and yet it was so well done, and so utterly...unfair that I wept through the intire chapter.  As you can probably tell, it hits extremely hard, particulerly if you have a sibling.  A word to the wise: if Vector Prime upset you, do not even think about reading this one.  One reviewer suggested that perhaps this character was put to rest because Luke now has his own son, and to keep ______ alive blocked the potential glory of this child.  While this is an interesting proposition, it sickensme to think that ______ died for no other reason than that Del Rey and George Lucas were too lazy to create places for both of them, and also, if some of you will recall, Luke's son Ben is only four months old, and that by the series end he will be about two and a half by my calculations, so unless they decide to extend it for another ten years, I sincerely doubt that Ben's place in the story will expand to include anything other than what he has already done; dirty his diapers, cry at innupertune moments, dirty his diapers some more, cry some more, need to be fed constantly.  Anyway, this book was great, if you can handle the death of a beloved character.  The writing is superb, character developments flawless, and the book, while being extremely dark, manages to have a few light moments as well.  Recommended to Star Wars fans who are fourteen up to adults.  Not for younger kids.	2001-11-10
US	47867897	R1AWSCA9XUYX8W	0439139341	124424501	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice #15: The Death Of Hope	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Excellent	In spite of the obvious unhappy nature of the plot of this book, it still manages to live up to it's predeccesers as far as plot development and scene description go, and I would say that it even surpasses many of them as far as character development goes. I won't give away the whole book, but basically this book begins almost immediately after Qui-Gon discovered that Tahl had been kidnapped. He and Obi-Wan immediately chase after her captors, their urgency intensified once they realize that the longer they take, the more of a potentially lethal paralyzing drug Balog (Tahl's captor) will pump into her body... Anyway, all else I'll say is that things are NOT what they seem! I noticed some people were irritated that this book focused mostly on Qui-Gon while Obi-Wan faded to the backround. I wonder why this is, since this series has ALWAYS (unlike Young/Junior Jedi Knights and other kiddy Star Wars books) focused almost equally on Obi-Wan (the child) and Qui-Gon (the adult) I always found that to be one of the better aspects of this series, since it provides a wider range of view for the story, and greater oppurtunity for<BR>character development. However, if my fellow Obi-Wan fans would look hard enough, they would see that in fact this book holds more character development for Obi-Wan then ever before. Sure, he gets his leg mashed under a boulder, and messes up a few other times, but where do you think Qui-Gon would have been without Obi-Wan to take up his slack, and take charge of things, and be the master when Qui-Gon's determination to save his beloved gave way to panic? To me, this shows how far he has truly come. Anyway, as to the death of ____, I was quite devestated, but I was also prepared, since she wasn't present in Episode 1, I<BR>could only assume that by then they had broken up (not likely) or ____ had died. Even so, I liked this new twist in the story, and the portrayal of Qui-Gon as a man in love, so I will certainly miss her, being that she was one ofmy favorite characters. Anyway, I recommend this book to fans of Star Wars in general, particulerly those twelve and under, thought don't get me wrong, those of us who are older (I'm almost sixteen) can love them too! May the Force be with you!	2001-11-02

First of all, those who say this book is no good frankly don't know what they're talking about.  Sure, maybe the writing style wasn't as good as some of the previous ones, but the characters were well developed and true to themselves, the battle scenes are capable of making you feel as though you're there, and is there anything else that really matters in a Star Wars book?  Ha!  If I wanted a perfect work of art, I'd go read Shakespeare!  Anyway, while this book is by no means perfect (and I like it that way), Mr. Keyes has once again created a fine window into the Star Wars universe, wide enough (unlike Conquest) to include many characters in several intertwining plots.  The first, and most important IMO concerns Luke and Mara.  Our favorite Jedi couple is days from expecting their firstborn, so when Fey'lya manages to secure an order for their arrest, it could not have come at a worse time.  To make matters worse, as they are preparing to flee, it becomes abruptly clear that Vereger's Tears, which had been keeping Mara's disease safely away, are a danger to her unborn child, and she must decide (and quickly) whether to take the Tears and save herself, or protect her child as best she can with the Force, while sparing little to protect the rest of her body.  Of course, if you know anything about Mara Jade, it's fairly obvious what she chooses, so she and Luke head for the Errant Venture, where most of their students are in hiding, while Mara's health gradually deterierates...  Luke, realizing that with the galaxy's hateful attitude against Jedi, he can no longer afford to have them divided between himself and Kyp, sends Jaina to find him and try to convince him to return to the rest of the Jedi.  When she gets there, there is some decidedly...creepy dialogue and interaction between them, Kyp and Jaina that is (am I mistaken or is this former darksider, massmurdering, sneaky, manipulating jerk of a thirty five year old man trying to hit on seventeen year old Jaina?), and through the course of this it he manages to convince her that the Vong have grown a massive super-weapon, and that she should use her influence with Rogue Squadren to go defeat it.  You'll have to read the book to find out what comes out of this situation, but tell you right now, it ain't pretty.  Meanwhile, Han, Leia and Jacen are on the Millenium Falcon trying to create a networking &quot;underground railroud&quot; for Jedi and young students in danger from the rest of the galaxy.  Han and Leia gradually repair their broken marriage, something that will definitely please you if you're a fan of this couple, while Jacen continues to struggle with his inner confusion on how the Force should be used, and what his place is in the universe.  At the same time, Anakin (now sixteen), Tahiri, and Corran Horn head out on a simple supply run, only to find themselves at the mercy of the Jedi hunting Peace Brigade.  During the course of this, Anakin and Tahiri begin to come to terms with their changing feeling for one another.  I know, I know, though I myself am their age my first thought was, They're too young, but actually it is quite well done, sweet, heartwarming, and not overly mushy, just one kissing scene.  Anyway, this was a great book and one of my favorites so far.  I recommend it to any Star Wars fan, if for no other reason than you get to find out what Luke names his son. (trust me, the book is worth reading just for that scene.)  I was very nearly in tears during the scenes with Mara and Luke; I simply cannot believe the amount of agony Mara went through for that child, I can honestly say I would have given up.  Anyway, read the book, love it, and try to ignore spoilers.	2001-10-30

While this book didn't have as large and diverse a cast of main characters, or anywhere near as complex a plot, the overall writing and style was definitely on a par with anything that came before it!  The scene descriptions were breathtaking, the death of a certain character heartbreaking (at least if you've read Junior Jedi Knights), and the battle scenes nerve-bending, without being overly bloodthirsty (unlike some others I could mention).  I am actually quite mystified at why some would say this book is no more than a glorified Young Jedi Knights novel.  To me that's partly what made it so enjoyable, since it followed up on characters and events that were left hangin in the actual series.  However, even if you've never in your life picked up a Junior/Young Jedi Knights book, the book is still understandable and quite valid to the series.  The main focus of this book was Anakin Solo, which was cool, since he has always (from the day of his birth) been shunted aside and practically ignored at times in favor of his dynamic and outgoing brother and sister, so it's real cool seeing how he's maturing.  Anyway, the Vong Warmaster has called for the heads of all the Jedi, (particularly Jacen's) saying that if all of the remaining Jedi are turned over to them, they will stop their vicous pummeling of New Republic forces.  Unfortunately, many citizens of the New Republic, having been terrified into a frenzy, are dumb enough to believe the ultimatum, and so eagerly begin to hunt Jedi, while the fractitious New Republic simply looks the other way.  While they are treated like criminals and hunted like animals, the Jedi are slowly coming apart at the seams.  Kyp Durron insists that the only way to fight the Vong and the Peace brigade is to return aggression with aggresion, but Luke maintains that that is of the Dark side, and that they must remain strong and peaceful.  However, realizing that the young students at the Jedi academy on Yavin 4 are in danger, Luke sends Talon Kardde to go and get the children of the planet.  He gives direct orders to the Solo children (having learned their dissapearing tricks by now) NOT to go there into the line of fire, but Anakin slips by him and races to the academy anyway, prompted by a disturbing vision of his best friend Tahiri in serious danger.  He gets there in time to warn them, and they quickly rescue almost all the kids, except Anakin, Tahiri, Sannah (Junior Jedi Knights), and Valin (Corran Horn's twelve year old son).  Tahiri is soon captured, and despite this Anakin manages to get Valin and Sannah rescued, while he presses on alone to save his friend, all the while uncomfortably aware (through their force bond) of the things the Vong are doing to Tahiri... Anyway, this was a great book, especially good for those of you who, (like me) were fans of the Junior Jedi Knights series.	2001-10-27

While I have found most of the books in this series better than the averedge Star Wars book of the earlier series', and very entertaining for the most part, none so far in the New Jedi Order has come close to this one! Kathy Tyers did an excellent job with The Truce at Bakura, but it's easy to see how much she's developed as a writer between this book and that one. (especially since here, her talents are not clouded by the annoying character of Gaeriel.) The writing is immpecable, the characters flawlessly portrayed and deeply emotional without being too sappy, and the general flow and plot gripping, realistic, and understandable. The author also manages to make this story uplifting and a bit dark at the same time, without using pages filled with blood and gore as some of the previous authers did, and this story was still just as compelling, if not more so, than it's predicessers. By this time in the series, the Vong have taken nearly half the galaxy, and the countless billions of terrified refugees pouring from the Vong occupied war zones is enough to make even the most generous and patriotic of planets unwilling to house them. This has become a major problem, so what remains of the fractitios New Republic government strikes a deal with the people of Duro, a planet so ruined and torn by wars on the surface that most of the inhabitants live in floating cities above the atmostphere.  The refugees will work to restore Duro to a livable state, and Duro's government will allow the refugees to live there with them in peace and relative safely for the duration of the war. The deal is readily agreed to, but it isn't long before cultural diferences and and the strain of being in close quarters begin to rise between the New Republic and Duro, and the refugees themselves. Han and Jacen are sent there to help, not knowing that Leia is only &quot;klicks&quot; away working partially against them, while barely seventeen year old Jaina (having been with Rogue Squadren for months now) is shot down and badly wounded (as in temporary blindness, messed up legs, broken ribs, etc) as well badly scared, her confindence perhaps permenantly shaken.  Meanwhile, Luke and Mara get news that a young Jedi apprentice has gone missing, so, finding the listless New Republic government unhelpful as usual, they take Anakin and strike out on their own to find the girl. At the same time, Mara's been feeling a little...strange, and so, fearing her remission has ended, and her disease is about to flare up again, she tries to destroy with the Force whatever it is, only to discover that it's no biological terror that is growing inside her...  Anyway, as I already stated, altogether this was one of the best and most entertaining Star Wars books I've read in a while, and I have to say I'm more than impressed with this author's ability to carry a story begun by previous authors. While this book mainly focused on Jacen, it did not exclude everyone else, and was thus a diverse, well built story.  While other books tended to portray Jacen's plaintive soul-searching and confusion as to to his place in the universe as weak and pointless, I was pleased to at last see an author who not only remembers what it's like to be a teenager, but also refused to condescend to Jacen, or us, in that way.  For once, I didn't feel that the older characters were compromised in favor of the younger ones, (something that's been bothering me for a while in this series) yet at the same time it could easily be seen that the kids are coming into their own, whether they're ready to or not.  I was also quite pleased at the abrupt new developments in Luke and Mara's relationship; since Heir to the Empire, this is what I've been waiting for.  Luke and Mara have been my favorite couple for a while, and I was deeply pleased to finally see the focus switching back to them.  This author portrayed their relationship almost on a par with Zahn, and it's fairly obvious how well she knows and cares for thesecharacters.  Han and Leia were interesting for a while, but now they've been married upwards of seventeen years and even their kids are all grown up, (and I must say have far more interesting relationships than they do) and they just remind me more of my parents than anything else.  Luke and Mara make the older generation as lively and interesting as the new one, but without compromising the much needed wisdom only an adult can have.  Anyway, this is an excellent book, that (unlike others in this series) I would recommend to all lovers of Star Wars!	2001-10-26

Well, this book was good.  Really good actually.  I greatly enjoy this author's style, and consider him one of the best they've had yet, but even so, I didn't think this one was quite as good as Hero's Trial.  This book, like it's predecesser, focuses mainly on Han Solo, who, after the devestating death of Chewbacca, flees his family and the pain of his friend's demise by immersing himself once again in the underworld of the smugglers.  Meanwhile, the galaxy in general has turned against the Jedi Knights, seeking to blame them for all the problems they have.  Leia travels to Hapes (Courtship of Princess Leia, Young Jedi Knights) on behalf of the New Republic, in order to ask her old friends if they will join forces with them in the hopes that together they can defeat the Vong.  Meanwhile, Corellia, fearing that the Vong may be targeting them next, call Anakin Solo back to their superweapon, Centerpoint, in the hopes that he could reactivate it, (a job no one but he could do) as he did as a seven year old (Corellian trilogy).  Anyway, suffice to say that this book is action packed and full of plenty of character stuff as well.  What truly annoyed me is, what happened to Mara?  It looked as if she really might be alright in the last book, and I for one, would have liked to see how she's doing firsthand, instead of just Luke talking about her to other people.  Also, rest assured, the Yuuzhan Vong are a scary villian.  Teenagers and adults will like this series but (contrary to most of the other Star Wars books) not good for young kids.  Anyway, this was a good book that I recommend to most other fans.	2001-10-12

However, writing and plot wise, I'd say this is probably one of the best installments to come along yet. I was also pleased to finally see a book that focused almost exclusively on the adult characters. The kids are great, but I'd hate to see them replace Luke, Leia, Mara and Han and the like too soon. Anyway, in this book the Vong decide that the fastest way to defeat the New Republic would be to destroy their greatest asset; the Jedi. They dispatch the Priestess Elan, equiped with a killing biological weapon living inside her, along with her 'familier' Vergere (Rogue Planet anyone?) to go and feign deffection to the New Republic in order to get close enough to the Jedi to destroy them. Elan claims to have information about a disease her people infected one of the Jedi with (Mara of course). Anyway, Mara continues to fight the disease the Vong infected her with, but she's losing at best, and is now practically on her deathbed. Meanwhile Han's grief over Chewie has turned into a lust for revenge, and he heads out with an old smuggler pal of his to hunt down Reck Desh, a leader of a bizarre group of people called the Peace Brigade, allied with the Vong, who believe the only way to stop the Vong is to give them what they want. Anyway, this book is quite a bit more intracite then some of the others. Though it focuses mainly on Han, there are many other subplots revolving around each other. It's pretty intense at times, so I can't say I'd recommend it to kids, though teenagers and adults will enjoy it.	2001-09-23
US	47867897	R3MBB8LSKBG26F	0439242045	266109571	Star Wars: The Jedi Quest	Books	4	16	17	N	N	Good, quite good in fact	I can't help but be a bit surprised at to how many less than favorable reviews this book has gotten so far. I personally loved it. Sure, if your judging it on the scale of say, Heir to the Empire, than perhaps it leaves a bit to be desired, but to judge it in that way at all seems unfair, since this book is (as some of you adults seem to forget) aimed at twelve year olds. That is not to say that older people couldn't enjoy it (I'm almost sixteen) but they should keep that in mind. Most children wouldn't want to read a four hundred page book that you need a dictionary to get through with eight plots tangling themselves into each other. As a children's book, however, like Jedi Apprentice and Young Jedi Knights before it, it's excellent, managing to hold a fairly complex plot along with plenty of character development for Anakin and Obi-Wan both. Anyway, in this book the Jedi council decides to allow Anakin Skywalker (now thirteen) to build his own lightsaber at last. However, Anakin's childhood as a slave still returns to haunt him, and Obi-Wan cannot help but wonder, is his Padawan truly ready for this responsibility? Ready or not, Anakin tackles the project in the caves of Illum, and when he and Obi-Wan return to the Jedi Temple, the council already has a mission ready for them. They are ordered to find and intercept a gang of slave pirates; the very same ones who once traumatized Anakin and his fellow slaves. Anakin is quite eager to at last take his revenge on them, but is the temptation to the dark side too much to bear? Anyway, like I said this book was great, It was fascinating to find out how the lightsaber that would someday be weilded by Luke Skywalker and then Mara Jade was built! It was a great book, overall, and I recommend it stroungly to fans of Jedi Apprentice and Star Wars books in general.	2001-09-18
US	47867897	R3090D2TS9W62U	0439139333	72411065	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice #14: The Ties That Bind	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Excellent!	Well, I must admit this one surprised me.  It was starting to seem as if the series was past it's golden days, and I wasn't expecting much from this one, but it surprised me, as these books tend to do, by being not only well-written, but also having a unique and inspiring plot and well defined characters.  Anyway, in this book Qui-Gon has a disturbing vision of Tahl, his childhood friend, in serious danger.  He takes Obi-Wan and heads back to the temple immedietly, only to find her about to depart on a mission to a planet they had set to rights several years earlier, that is coming apart at the seams once again.  The Jedi Council forbids him to go after her, but he ignores their warnings and follows her anyway, and what he finds is quite disturbing... Meanwhile, Qui-Gon also is somewhat perplexed at the sudden deepening of his feelings towards Tahl.  Is it possible he could be falling in love?  As you can probably guess, this book full of action and excitement as well as character stuff, so fans of either will be satisfied.  My only real problem was that I didn't like that it skipped over so much time. (two years) In Deceptions it was fairly obvious that taking a Padawan was an issue for Tahl as well as Bant, and being that it has been a recurring theme throughout the series, I assumed it would be delt with, but now it has just been skipped over, so we'll never know what made Tahl change her mind about Bant.  As for the Tahl/Qui-Gon thing, well, I could see it coming even in book five when she was first introduced, but being that these books are aimed at 8-12 year olds, (though older teenagers and adults read them shamelessly) I didn't think it was something they would address in this series.  I'm not a big fan of romance at all, but there are some exceptions, and I happen to like this relationship.  The down side is that since Tahl doesn't appear anywhere in Episode 1, we can only assume she dies in the next couple of books, which annoys me greatly, since she's always been one of my favorites.  What's interesting about this is that it comes to terms with something that's never been mentioned before.  It's fairly obvious that in the new order of Jedi, love and marriage between Jedi or even Jedi and non-force sensitives is no problem whatsoever, since we have examples such as Luke and Mara,  Kam and Tionne, among others I'm sure; but when is this shown in the old order?  It will be interesting to see how the Council reacts when they hear.  Anyway, fans of the series will love this one, but if you're just starting out, read it from the beginning so it will make sense.	2001-09-15

The only real complaint I have is that once again way to much book space was wasted on the Solo kids and their peers.  Don't get me wrong here; Jacen, Jaina and Anakin are some of my favorite characters, I just don't want to see everyone cool from the previous generation fade into oblivion too quick.  Besides the twins got their own series a while back, as did Anakin.  Anyway, the war against the Yuuzhan Vong continues in this installment, and is, to say the least, not going well for the New Republic.  Even the Jedi struggle within their own ranks as to what form of action to take against the Vong, who by this time have advanced beyond the rim and are aiming for Ithor next.  If Ithor is taken, the Vong will have a clear shot at the rest of the galaxy, and gone will be the chance to drive them away quickly.  The situation is so dire in fact, that the New Republic has alied itself with it's old nemesis, the Emperial Remnant.  Anyway, nearly everyone is featured prominently in this one, except Han of course, since he is still drinking himself to death over Chewie.  While I wish Luke and especially Mara were in this more, all in all it was a good book.  As of the Solo kids, I find I can identify with all them.  Anakin, because he is exactly my age, and because the first Star Wars books I ever read were Junior Jedi Knights, so I will always harbor a bit of loyalty to him.  Jaina, because I really like how she's turning out.  She may have seemed a bit weak and almost teeny bopperish in Young Jedi Knights, but believe me this is one gal you would not want to mess with.  Jacen, well, I've heard some of you describe him as &quot;annoying&quot; but that is only because you 'grownups' have forgotten what it's like to be that age.  While I don't neccecarily agree with his philosophy, I sympathize with him totally and perhaps identify with him best of all.  Anyway, if you read this series, startwith Vector Prime no matter what kinds of things you've heard about it.  Once again I'd mostly recommend this series to teenagers and adults, since they're quite a bit harsher than most of the other Star Wars books.	2001-09-09

First of all, even if you hated Vector Prime, I urge you to at least give this one a try. It has everything that was good about Vector Prime, plus plenty of things that make it even better, and none of the drawbacks. Anyway, it takes place about two months after the events of Vector Prime, with the galaxy now under attack from a bizarre species from another galaxy called the Yuuzhan Vong. The New Republic government, run by Borsk Fey'lya, &lt;gagging noises&gt; refuses to acknowledge them as a threat, despite the destruction of several planets out on the rim from their scary bio-technology. Meanwhile this sparks unrest even in the Jedi's ranks, as Kyp slowly gains more followers, to go and take more offensive action against the Vong, while Luke does his best to hold the Jedi order together. He sends Anakin and Mara to Dantooine to see if the Vong have gotten there yet, and so Mara can rest for a while, and hopefully make some progress against her disease, while he and Jacen head to Belkadon to try to figure out why the Vong made the wierd plague thing happen there. Everyone pretty much winds up on Dantooine, fleeing the Vong, and when Leia and Jaina show up with several ships full of terrified reffugees from Dubrillian things get all the more complicated. I really liked this book's writing style, straightforward, interesting, lots of action, and plenty of character development. When you read this book you do not need to ask yourself if Luke and Mara are really in love with each other, (as was often the case with Vector Prime) or reread the same paragraph several times to make sure you 'get' it. Each of the sub-plots was given adequate attention, so that I could feel for all the characters in their individual crisis'. Jacen's seeming &quot;identity crisis&quot; really struck home for me. Most of all though, I really liked the way Mara helped Anakin, and gently seemed to guide him back to the right path for him. So far, she seems to be the only one who actually &quot;gets&quot; what he's going through. Some would say she's mellowed out since her assasin/smuggler days, but I am of the opinion that careing for others has only made her all the stronger, disease and all. As another reviewer put it, being one of the coolest women in the Star Wars doesn't mean she can't love her family. Even so, this book reminds me strangely of a cross between Young Jedi Knights and I,Jedi, and I honestly don't know whether to be pleased or annoyed. Don't get me wrong here; I loved the Young Jedi books, but even so, it irritates me a bit to see the Solo kids gradually replace my favorite characters, and I can't shake the feeling that fifteen year old Anakin, and sixteen year old Jacen and Jaina are far too young to be replacing the adults just yet... A good thing about this book, however, and what really redeamed it for me, was that Luke and Mara (my favorite characters) finally get some attention. For once they actually act like a married couple. This book makes their relationship seem much more real, and I certainly hope the next authors keep this up! Anyway, this is an excellent book, which I definitely recommend to Star Wars fans, though probably not younger ones since this book had quite a bit of graphic violence.	2001-08-19
US	47867897	R1EGR7QYVDJM9M	0345428447	87344379	Vector Prime (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 1)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Not as bad as it's made out to be...	First of all, this book is by no means as terrible as most people say it is.  I know most of this is due to the hard facts that this book brings to light, (Mara getting sick, Chewbacca dieing,) (my apologies to those of you who have been living on Alpha Centairi and haven't found that out yet) yet even so, I was one of those glad to see a bit of reality find it's way into Star Wars.  In real life, there is no bubble of safety.  People we love die, and there really is nothing we can do to stop it.  True, Chewie's death broke my heart, but I had read the spoilers before hand, so I was prepared at least.  Though, if they had decided to kill one of my favorites, such as Luke, or Mara or even Han or one of the kids I would probably be just as devastated as some of the Chewie fans are now.  I have to admit I'm actually more shaken up over Mara Jade (my favorite character) being sick than anything else that happened in this book, and she isn't even dead yet!  Anyway, this book actually takes place about 21 years after Return of the Jedi.  That may sound like a big enough space of time that you would need to have read every bit of Star Wars fiction written so far in order to understand this one, but actually this book does a great job of starting with a clean slate.  All you really need to know is that by this time the Rebellion has renamed itself The New Republic and has conquered most of the galaxy before making it's peace with the bare remnants of the Empire, which now exists in only a shadow of it's former glory, in one little corner of the galaxy.  Han and Leia are married and have three teenage children, Jacen and Jaina (twins, age sixteen) and Anakin (age fifteen).  Luke is married by this time too; to Mara Jade, a former Imperial assasin.  Anyway, the basic premis of the book is that a new extragalactic threat (Yuuzhan Vong) has risen, and our heroes, (and their children) must fight it.  Warning also: this book has quite a bit more graphic violence than most of theStar Wars books that have come before.  Don't get me wrong, it's quite tastefully done, and not at all just for shock value.  As another reviewer pointed out, if this were a movie it would have to cut a lot to avoid an R rating.  This was actually quite surprising since I would hand most of the other Star Wars books to a ten year old with a clear concience, but this one, well, let's just say it would have to be a pretty special ten year old.  As to the overall writing quality of this book I'd have to say about medium/high.  Things were described well, but the first half of the book felt slightly strained and until Chewbacca's death it's almost completely devoid of emotional significance.  Also, being that this is the first adult book written so far that takes place after Vision of the Future I was hoping to see at least a connection between Luke and Mara.  Some readers complain that in this book they don't act is if they're married even, but they do, just as if they've been married around forty years rather than six.  Loving, supportive, yet platonic, and often prone to pointless bickering.  Don't let this throw you off the series though; stick with it, and read the next book at least, since it takes much better care of their relationship.  Mara wasn't exactly herself in this book, but I guess she certainly has her reasons, and I forgive her.  However, it was so awesome when she beat up that Vong guy and totally stunned him with her fighting prowess, disease and all!  Anyway, not the best book ever, but definitely 'worthy'.  Might want to read a couple others for backround first, but not really neccesary if you're not inclined to do such a thing.	2001-08-13

While the other books in the series continued Ender's story, yet had little to do with the original Ender's Game, this book goes into the mind of another child in Battle School.  Bean is, if anything, even more brilliant than Ender, and it is this brilliance that brings him to the attention of Battle School recruiters, when he is nothing more than a tiny street urchin, wandering the the streets of the hellish city of Rotterdam.  Though Bean's almost constant arrogance annoyed me, I found him to be a basically endearing character, who I came to enjoy very much.  Just from reading this book one can see how much the author had developed as a writer since Ender's Game, and it is actually in some ways and even better book, though I would recommend reading Ender's Game for backround first.	2001-08-09

The book is great, but not understandable on it's own.  Besides that though, this book is excellent, very well written and excellent character development.  Anyway, in this book Ender has married and settled on Lusitania, when the Starways Congress decides to send a fleet there to destroy the planet, and the human killing virus, Descolada, that has manifested itself there, but that the Piggies need to complete their unique life cycle.  Now Ender and Novinha's children must fight once more to prevent another xenocide...  Anyway, once again this book is excellent and I guarentee it will have an emotional reaction out of you one way or another.  I would most definitely have rated this one five stars, if not for some extremely sexist dialogue and inuendo, which takes a lot out of a book for me.  I was also surprised by how many people didn't like this book because it was too long!  Why?  It's only six hundred pages.  Reality check please!  This is how long good books are!  Gosh, I've honestly read Star Wars books that were longer than this one!  Anyway, read the book, and love it, but start with Ender's Game or at least Speaker for the Dead.	2001-08-03

It continues about where Xenocide left off, with Ender's mind/force thing or whatever now controlling second incarnations of his beloved older sister, Valentine, and Peter, his long dead older brother as well as himself.  While Ender tries to join his wife in the convent place she fled to, Peter travels with a young chinese servent girl, Wang Mu, and they try to manipulate the Star Ways Congress into calling off the fleet sent to destroy Lusitania.  In the meantime, Miro and &quot;Young Val&quot; work to try to save Jane, the dying computer intelligence that is the only thing that allows intelligent species faster than light travel.  Anyway, the plot is incredibly complicated, so I won't even try to explain it all, but rest assured that this series is worth reading.  The one thing that really annoyed me about this book in particular was something that several other reviewers have commented on as well.  Not only does Ender's choice to remain with his wife no matter what &quot;bore him to death&quot; but it is also implied that all relationships are like that!  I find that offensive!  Anyway, before I get off on a rant I'll just say that this is a great series, if you ignore a lot of implied sexism, which I certainly hope bothers some of you as much as it does me.  Happy reading!	2001-08-03

Excellent plot, well fleshed out characters,  great situations.  In short it had, as few books do, everything it would need to make itself great.

Having turned down his brother Peter, for being too violent, and his sister Valentine, for being too mild, they have at last found Ender, who they think could be the next Napolean.  Taken from his home, his family, and everything he knows, he is brought to Battle School, and trained.  And he thrives...  Anyway, I won't give any more away for the benefit of those who haven't read it yet, but I urge that you do read it.  This has to be one of the best science fiction novels ever, and if you have even a slight interest in that field this will be a favorite.  One thing that did annoy me though was that at the beginning when Ender was talking to Graff, he asks if there are girls in Battle School too, and Graff says only a few because there are too many years of evolution against them!  Oh yeah, this culture isn't &quot;Sexist&quot; or anything, it's just us that are at fault.   Well, I'm sorry, but I find that offensive!  Also, if they thought Peter was too violent to go to Battle School, (I mean really, they want warriors don't they?) then he must have been pretty bad, and if he was that bad, than why didn't they have him under observation and such, rather than letting him grow up with very do-able plans to take over the world by age twelve?  It was obvious that he had the capabilities and the motivation to do it, and it was pretty obvious they knew that as well, so why didn't they do something about that?  Oh well.  Besides those things though, this book was probably one of the best I've everread, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone.	2001-07-31

See what happens when you fight with your brother?  Shedamei was one of my favorite characters from the beginning, so I was also quite pleased to see her return.  This book also had a few more strong women then the other books, but less emphasis on that part of the story than the others as well.  All in all, a good ending, and though the women's rights part of it wasn't solved to my satisfaction, the ending was hopeful so my mind was put at ease.	2001-07-27
US	47867897	RR7REQWCYWMJP	0439139384	649921712	Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice Special Edition #01: Deception	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fairly good book, resolves some interesting issues	While not the best ever in the series, it definitely does seem to take it in a solid upswing.  It resolves several important issues that seemed to have been simply forgotten when the actual events occured.  The book takes place in two time periods, the first with Obi-Wan still a young boy apprenticed to Qui-Gon (the normal time frame of Jedi Apprentice) and the other taking place several years after Episode 1 with Obi-Wan now training twelve year old Anakin.  The first basically deals with Obi-Wan's guilt over the accidental death of Bruck Chun, as he has to face Bruck's family and the intire senate, trying him for the other boy's murder.  Though it is is a mystery to me whether this first storyline is supposed to take place shortly after book seven (when Bruck was actually killed) or where the regular series currently is, after book thirteen.  I also wonder if the second storyline takes place before or after Rogue Planet?  I'm betting on before, personally.  Anyway, when you begin the second storyline you will probably wonder what the heck it has to with the first, but I urge you to stick with it.  Yoda sends Obi-Wan and Anakin on their first mission together; to go and check out this weird starship colony of isolationists who have been inspiring complaints of brainwashing.  Once there Obi-Wan again meets up with Bruck's brother, Kad, rekindling Obi-Wan's memory of the boy, and his guilt...  What exactly Anakin has to do with this story I have no idea, since his only purpose seems to be to whine and complain that Obi-Wan is hiding his past from him.  Anyway, I liked that this book was longer than some of the others, (naturally to accomadate two storylines) though both of them, by themselves, seemed a little too short and rushed, but together they actually make quite a compelling story.  Another reviewer pointed out that after Episode 2 comes out these novels will probably switch to be completely Obi-Wan/Anakin like the second storyline in this book, rather than theusual Qui-Gon/Obi-wan of the normal series.  This would disapoint me, since I happen to like Qui-Gon/Obi-Wan, and I'll admit to not really liking Anakin to much, but hey, I'd still read them.  Anyway, I'd recommend this series to any Star Wars fan, though this book in particular would be practically impossible to understand unless you'd read at least the first eight in the series.	2001-07-15

Actually, I liked it quite a bit.  I thought Obi-Wan was portrayed well, and I liked Anakin's development since Episode 1.  However, I just really had a hard time getting into this one.  For one thing, the badguys seemed to spend more time argueing and double crossing each other than causing real problems, and their activities in general didn't seem to have much to do with what Anakin and Obi-Wan are doing until the very end.  So, I would say the this book isn't really neccesary unless you're a real fan, (as I am) since I doubt anything that happened in it will have much relevence to anything that occurs afterwards.  The &quot;seed partners&quot; though were adorable and it truly broke my heart when the ships &quot;died&quot;.  Also, the refrences to Vergere and the &quot;Far Outsiders&quot; were quite interesting however, so fans of the New Jedi Order will probably like this book.	2001-07-12
US	47867897	R6LTVN29MBWDA	0553578790	754763007	Vision of the Future (Star Wars: The Hand of Thrawn, Book 2)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	THE best Star Wars book EVER!!	This has to be the greatest Star Wars book to ever be written! Though I do recommend reading Spector of the Past before hand, this one surpasses it and just about anything else that's been written in the Star Wars universe. Anyway, things are really heating up for the New Republic, as the Caamas Document remains maddingly elusive, and the intire New Republic is about to explode into civil war; and the increasing rumers and threats hinting at Thrawn's supposed return aren't helping things.  Anyway, this book has a definite plot that is well constructed and understandable, excellent characters and situations, and is just generally a beautiful, well written, satisfying story. However, I do wish we could have been kept in the dark about Thrawn a little longer. I personally loved Thrawn in Zahn's original trilogy, and I was quite dissapointed to find out in the previous book that he hadn't really returned after all. It also got somewhat boring when &quot;we&quot; knew the truth practically from the beginning, but the good guys spend the next 4000 pages hemming and hawing and speculating about it. Shada, I have to admit is a tough and cool female, without having to be a clone of Mara either, though I do agree with another reviewer that she seems a bit like a consolation prize for Karrde.  Meanwhile, Luke continues his search for his beloved friend Mara Jade, prompted by a strange and disturbing vision of her in serious trouble, since she dissapeared on a strange planet. However, finding her is easy, compared to the task of infiltrating the strange fortress she was sent to check out...  Though this part altogether takes up less than half of the book, it is IMO the most important, and, though it's mostly about Luke and Mara trying to complete her mission on their own, as they both struggle with their growing feelings for each other the book balances action with romance better than any I've seen before.   Luke worries (somewhat superstitiosly) that his love would put Mara indanger, being that all his other girlfriends had something terrible happen to them, (like, Callista losing her powers and dumping him because she was jealous, Gaeriel died, Akanah lied, etc) while Mara fears all relationships period since they pose a possible threat to the barriers she's buried herself in, as well as her prized independance.  Anyway, it is all very tastfully done, just as I thought relationships between Jedi would develop; more through loving each other mentally than physically, though I can see how this would irritate some people.  Fans of Harlequin Romance will not like this book.  Right from Heir to the Empire I felt they were destined to be together, and I was thoroughly frustrated by numerous attempts other author's made to hook him up with someone else.  Even so, it was still only a question of when he'd come to his senses, and it seems as if he finally has! However, I was very pleased to note that where Luke's relationships with other women seemed stupid and unreal to me, his growing relationship with Mara seemed only that much stronger and substantial. I actually think it's cool. They meet as enemies, on opposite sides of a war, gradually become friends, and then ten years into their friendship, they get stuck on a certain mission together and realize their true feelings for each other, and slowly, tentatively, start to fall in love. Anyway, Mara IS perfect for Luke, since her hard, cynical, yet totally awesome nature is the perfect thing to balance Luke's kind, sensitive, &quot;farmboyish&quot; outlook. This was the first love story I truly enjoyed, and it was actually the love story part I liked the best! This book also stays away from all the truly nasty stuff that usually uccompanies love stories, and generally stays pretty innocent, but without making Luke and Mara look like fifth graders either. I actually found myself wishing Zahn had put in more than he did. (come on, he couldn't write in one more kiss for them?) I also wish that they had included the scene where they tell Luke's family instead of skipping over it. I mean really, it would have been interesting! They leave on a mission as friends and nothing more, and return a month or so later engaged. What would they say? How would Han and Leia take it?  How would they explain it to the kids?  I'm also thrilled that Mara will finally take advantage of her potential and actually become a Jedi at last. Anyway, if you ever read any Star Wars books, read the Thrawn trilogy for background, and then this one and it's prequel, and feel satistfied that you've pretty much gotten the whole story.	2001-07-08

While the first two novels were basically introductory, this one really seemed to take the story somewhere. Even so, if you like non-stop action, this series is not for you. The exitement of it is watching all the characters interact and develop, and every once in a while some action will sneak up without warning. I basically continues the adventures of these sixteen people, as their character development continues and the actual journey starts at last. I probably would have even rated it five stars had it not been for this book's somewhat sexist attitude. At first the women are strong and stand up for themselves and try to force the men to make the rules fair and equal, but in the end all of them except Rasa and Shedamai find their &quot;true place&quot; and become weak and sappy little mothers content to do nothing but leave all the important stuff up to the men and change diapers, and even they seem to &quot;quiet down&quot; a bit. Even the bad guys are unfair to women! The &quot;evil&quot; women are portrayed as nasty, petty, shallow, I'll-jump-in-bed-with-anyone-as-long-as-it's-not-my-husband type women, while the men threaten each other with murder and such! This book also makes it seem that commiting adultery is the worst crime a women could possibly commit, and yet it's somehow okay if a man does the exact same thing, because he can't help his hormones. Gimme a break! And am I the only one who finds people getting married at twelve/thirteen, marrying their uncles or cousins, and sleeping with their neices somewhat gruesome?

All I can say is, even if you have hated every single Star Wars  book written before this one, I gaurentee you won't be able to put this one down!  None of the other writers quite measure up to Zahn, and he has obviosly developed as a writer since the original Thrawn trilogy.  Anyway, this book takes place about 15 years after Return of the Jedi, and ten years after Thrawn's campaign.  New reports and rumers are surfacing that it was a group of bothans who were working for the Emperor who destroyed the planet of Camaas nearly half a century earlier, and the Camaasi (and about a thousand other peoples using Camaas as an excuse to revive and act on their own grudges) are out for blood, and the entire New Republic is ready to explode into civil war.  The reports also mention that Thrawn could be back, which altogether spells disaster.  Luke meanwhile, has a strange and disturbing vision of his long time friend Mara Jade in trouble on a certain mission, and he rushes off to rescue her, much to Mara's annoyance.  Anyway, this is a really great book, and I guarentee you'll be screaming for the sequel once you finish it (I was lucky enough to be have bought Vision of the Future at the same time, hee hee).  With all the millions of subplots it does get pretty confusing at some points, and to understand Leia's section of the plot you have to have a basic understanding of politics, but as long as you have a decent number of braincells I doubt anyone would have any problems with it.  The Luke/Mara plot is fascinating as well; I can't wait to find out what the fortress is and what goes on there, and I also wonder what is going to happen between them in general, since this seems to be the first book since The Last Command that has added on to the theme of them possibly becoming &quot;more&quot; than friends.  I have always felt that they belong together, and I can't wait to see what happens in Vision of the Future.	2001-07-02
US	47867897	R38D1XKKIN4EQR	0553298062	879754916	Showdown at Centerpoint (Star Wars: The Corellian Trilogy, Book 3)	Books	4	1	2	N	N	End to a fairly satisfying trilogy	I know a lot of people hated this book because of it's somewhat inferior writing style, so I was fully prepared to hate the series as well, but as I found it's actually quite good as long as you don't expect Shakespeare.  While the first book was pretty slow, and the second one pretty much just a filler novel, this last one made the intire trilogy worthwhile.  The story at last begins to take on a real shape, and the real villian is at last revealed. (Yippee! It's not the Empire!) Luke, Lando, and the Bakurans are fighting the battle against the Human League in the Corellian Sector, while Han, Leia, and Mara (talk about odd character combinations, but hey, that's part of what gives this series it's charm) try to talk some sense into the Selonians and figure out what is really going on.  Meanwhile, Jacen, Jaina, and Anakin, along with Chewie and two Drall who are accompanying them discover that the Corellian Sector itself is not as it appears.  Anyway, while I liked Jacen and Jaina being portrayed as somewhat normal nine year old kids, and not &quot;wonderbrats&quot; as they usually are, Anakin was quite annoying.  I mean he is supposed to be seven years old, but the way he acts is closer to a three year old!  Not only that, but he is portrayed as being so naively brilliant with machines, that adults, his own parants included, would use him to win wars and such.  Give me a break!  Also this author seemed to have the kids and their special powers somewhat mixed up.  While technically, Anakin is the strongest in the Force of the three kids, it is Jaina who is specially gifted in machines.  Anakin's special power is that he is especially good at puzzles and in some ways with machines.  Jaina is more good at the physical aspect of machinery.  Also, Jacen is not at all good with machines, as they portrayed in this series; his special talent is the ability to talk to living things.  Also, being that according to my calculations Luke and Mara will be tying the knot a littleless than a year from when this book takes place, I was hoping for a LITTLE more forshadowing to the event in this book, rather than their usual &quot;breif exchange of a few words, if that, occasional idle flirtation&quot; ritual they go through whenever they meet.  While I suppose it does hint a little more than most of the others, you still would never believe these two would end up together.  Anyway, if you don't mind a book with a few flaws than I would definitely recommend this series.	2001-06-28

I personally, loved the intire series, but if you are one of those who disliked the first three because of the lack of action, than you'll like this one much better.  Finally, the tension that has been building gradually since the first book is finally about to explode, and at the worst possible time; during the journey to Earth!  The first part of the book chronicles the journey to Earth itself, and the problems they have getting there, and the second part tells of what happens to them once they get there, and gives a very insightful opinion of what Earth might be like forty million years from now; when two other dominent, sentient species have also rison in the absence of human beings.  Also, since a lot of people seem confused about this, yes there is a fifth book, but it takes place several hundred years later, and is about how humans can overcome their prejudeces and truly come home at last.  Anyway, I really liked this book a lot, and definitely recommend it to those who have been following the series.	2001-06-27

Sure, this author isn't Tim Zahn, but I think he did a reasonably good job (better than a few others I could mention anyway) and the series is certainly worth reading if you're really a serious fan. However, if you're just a casual fan somewhat interested in finding out what happens next, this is not one I'd recommend, especially if you're just starting out and don't know anything about Star Wars chronology. Also, for all of you who (like myself) hated Callista as Luke's girlfriend and always thought he should be with Mara, think about the consequences if this series hadn't been written when it was, or not at all! (This series taking place about fourteen years after Return of the Jedi, and Star Wars history at the time it was written being at about six or seven years after Return of the Jedi) Though Callista was officially introduced in Children of the Jedi (eight years after Return of the Jedi) this series had already been written at the time and though it takes place some years later, she is never mentioned in it, since her character did not exist at the time it was written.  So naturally it was fundamentally impossible for Luke and Callista to end up together due to George Lucas's lifesaving rule of all Star Wars books having to relate to each other. Anyway, this series picks up almost exactly where the previous one left off, shortly after the attack on Corona house, with Han imprisoned in a dungeon by his own long lost cousin, and sharing a cell with a somewhat bloodthirsty alien, Luke and Lando trying to get help for the Corelian sector which is trapped under an interdiction field, and Leia also stuck in a cell on Corellia with a room mate she isn't exactly pleased with... I have to admit Lando and Tendra make a cute couple. I didn't really like her much at first, because she seemed pretty boring, but I do like her with Lando. She's stable enough to keep him on the ground, but fun and interesting enough so he won't be bored, and I suppose anything is better than that whole Lando/Mara thing that seemed to be going on in some of the previous novels. Also, Gaeriel Captison makes her return at last in this book. I have to admit I like her better now since she seems a stronger female and can stand up for herself. Also she is no longer a love interest of Luke's so that opened me up to her more as well. Speaking of Luke, I felt bad for him in this book, since, while Gaeriel is no longer a love interest, her presence reminds him of how lonely he is... Also this book has some very interesting interaction between Leia and Mara, two characters who, while initially not trusting each other, have to work together to escape, and eventually start to become friends, which is good since within a year or so they're going to be sisters. It annoyed me though, that Han and Leia still seem to distrust her so much. She's been their friend for what, nine years? And even when she was an evil imperial agent it was Luke she wanted to kill, and even he has long since made up with her, and they have been close friends ever since. The kids are also fun to watch, since, being a longtime fan of Young Jedi Knights, it was fun to watch them as cute, spoiled, mischievous, superpowered, youngsters. Anyway, this is a good book that I greatly enjoyed and would recommend to most fans.	2001-06-26

While it's no work of art, the writing style is straightforward and entertaining and easy to understand.  Plot wise, the book is excellent, and most of the characters are intact also.  Anyway, it's now fourteen years after Return of the Jedi, and it is a time of relative peace in the New Republic.  Han and Leia decide they need to get away with their kids for a while, and they go to Han's home planet of Corellia.  However, once they get there, they discover (of course) that things aren't as tranquil as they thought.  Meanwhile, Lando cons Luke into coming  with him on his latest money making scheme: find a rich wife, fast.  Altogether as a trilogy starter, this book was pretty good.  Not the best series out there, but definitely worth  reading.  However, I thought Luke was portrayed as being just a little too stiff and formal and akward, and Mara Jade (my favorite character I might add) was just awful.  Hasn't she learned anything in the last nine years?  She is not the Mara Jade we all know and love, but rather an untrusworthy, half-criminal, and altogether unapealing character.  If there is one thing that is Mara Jade, even when she was evil, it was honorable and trustworthy.  While she doesn't give her trust often, and she will never give it to just anyone, one she does she would stand by that person to the death.  I sincerely doubt this author read the Thrawn trilogy.  While naturally not trusting Mara at first, Han and Leia eventually came to like her, and we all know Luke was always her friend, even when she really, REALLY tried not to like him, so why are they so wary of her motives now just because nine years ago she happened to have grudge against Luke for destroying something she was brainwashed from a small child to think was right?  Luke forgave her, and they have been friends ever since, so what is the problem.  Anakin's character was poorly portrayed as well.  The kid isseven years ald and he honestly acts like a three year old, talking in broken sentences and such, and the twins, who are nine  or ten now I might add, still play with blocks!  Anyway, while casual fans might find this series confusing and silly, I liked it and  I would recommend it to any fairly serious fan.	2001-06-16

Sure, by itself it might seem boring and that nothing happens, but a lot of this book was just setting up for the rest of the series, so a lot of it is hard to &quot;get&quot; until you read the others.  I personally loved this book, and found it fascinating, not at all your typical sci-fi book.  Anyway, it takes place about forty million years in the future, when we, as humans have exhiled ourselves to  the planet Harmony until we feel worthy to return to Earth.  To make sure that we can never again build the mass weapons of destruction we put this giant computer (the Oversoul) in orbit around the planet to control the minds of people to a certain degree.  Anyway by the time this story takes place, the people barely even remmember legends about Earth, and to them the Oversoul has become a kind of god.  However, the Oversoul knows it's getting old and can't protect the people much longer, so it decides to start making the preperations to return to Earth, though it knows the people aren't ready yet.  The main part of the story is basically about a fairly ordinary fourteen year old boy called Nafai, who, like most people in his age group, is somewhat confused by just about everything.  Like I said, in order to really understand this instalment, you have to read the others, and I urge you to have patience and do so, because believe me, it's worth it!  One thing that did bother me, was while even though this was a female dominated society, most of the men are still sexist jerks who look down on women and treat them like toys!  Is this fair?  What it is basically saying is that in a male dominated society women can be weak and silly and fade into the background like they're &quot;supposed to&quot;, but in a female dominated society, men can still be strong! Grrrr  Anyway,  besides that it was a good book that I greatly enjoyed.	2001-06-16

I personally loved it, because it read like a REAL book, not a cheesy imatation of one, and most of the characters were reasonably well portrayed and developed, AND the plot was the first in a very long time (since the Thrawn Trilogy, really) that actually got me sitting on the edge of my seat wondering if everyone was gonna come out alive. This book had somewhat of a darker feel than a lot of the others, almost reminiscent of Empire Strikes Back in some ways... Anyway, this book takes place about thirteen years after Return of the Jedi. Leia is still the Chief of State, Han is still basically a house husband (YEAH! I'm all for that!) and Luke finally seems to be over the early mid-life crisis he has been in for about the last five books, ever since that witch Callista dumped him. (talk about stupid!) Anyway, suddenly and with no explanation, a planet is destroyed somewhere, but no one but the most force sensitive people even feel it, (Luke, Mara, Leia, the twins and Anakin, and a few others on Yavin 4) At about the same time, a bomb goes off in the senet hall and nearly kills Leia, and an investigation is immediatly started to find out the cause of these two catastraphes. Luke thinks it's one of his former students gone bad, and it turns out to be two of them working together, Brakiss (Young Jedi Knights, anyone?) and an incredibly force strong young boy named Dolph, (now calls himself Kueller) who has set himself up to be the newest menace of the New Republic. This may not sound all the scary, and if it were written by anyone else, it probably wouldn't be, but this author's fine writing talent really bring out this threat and actually had me worried for a while. Suffice to say this is one heck of a book that I recommend to any Star Wars fan. My one real problem with this book was that it kept on referring almost constantly to Children of the Jedi, as if it was the only important StarWars book to take place before this one. If anything it was the least important, since nothing that happened in it had any long standing effect on anything later on. The Eye is destroyed, Callista dumps Luke about six months into their relationship, and while this basically turns him into a basketcase for the next three or four years, eventually he forgets she even existed and marries his TRUE love, Mara Jade. Speaking of Mara Jade, while I was glad she finally came back into the story, (she's been gone since Darksaber and I was missing her) I was somewhat disapointed with her portrayal in this book. Here she is not the strong, tough, intelligent, beautiful, dangerous, sarcastic, rude, smart, fun, stong-willed, force sensitive, red headed wild cat who plays by her own rules and will not under any circumstances take crud from anyone type of girl who I loved from the instant I started Chapter 3 of Heir to the Empire, but rather a somewhat two-dimensional character with no place in the story other than to be Karrde's sidekick, Lando's exgirl, and Luke's potential love interest. I understand that no one can portray her like Timothy Zahn (she's his character after all) but it can be a little frustrating. Though this one is a little more adult oriented than some of the others that is not to say that a kid couldn't read it. I'm fifteen and I had not trouble with it. Also, this might be a little confusing if you haven't read at least some of the books that take place before it, though it can be read on it's own without too much trouble. Anyway this is a good book that is definitely worth reading. MTFBWY!	2001-06-14

Not great, but good.  Most of the stories tie in some way into the &quot;mainstream&quot; Star Wars universe, and even those that don't still make sense.  I would not however, recommend this to someone who is not well versed in the &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; of Star Wars, but if you have read most of the books than this one is certainly a jewel.  Though I think the title is somewhat misplaced, (most of the stories take place long after the the Empire has fallen.) besides that I have no real complaints.  The stories are:<br />First Contact: My favorite, tells how Mara Jade hooked up with Talon Karrde.<br />Tinnian on Trial: A spoiled rich girl quickly becomes a hardened fighter when her family is murdered by the Empire.  <br />The Final Exit: Yet another smuggler's confused encounter with a Jedi Knight of old.<br />Missed Chance: A Corran Horn story taking place before he was in Rogue Squadron.<br />Retreat from Coruscant: During Dark Empire a mail cargo captain is trapped on Coruscant during the Emperial invasion.<br />A Certain Point of View: A young woman with Imperial upbringing meets up with an old love, but has a change of heart when she finds out his true loyalties.<br />Blaze if Glory: A somewhat confusing story about a group of smugglers.<br />Slaying Dragons: An interesting depiction of what it might have been like for an ordinary imperial family, and the effect the war  had on them.<br />Do No Harm: A Rebel doctor is forced to break his oath to do no harm in order to save one of his patients.<br />Side Trip:(four parts) This long but fascinating story is a collaboration between the two best Star Wars authors, Timothy Zahn, and Michael Stackpole.<br />Anyway, this book is highly recommendable if you know your Star Wars.

I wouldn't however, recommend this to someone who has had little experience with the Expanded Universe,  because they would be totally lost.

Well, perhaps I am a little biast, since I hated the first two books and was fully prepared to hate this one as well. While this one was perhaps more intracite and well put together than the other two, it was confusing and even more frustrating than the others.  Don't get me wrong though, unlike some other Star Wars books I could mention, the author's writing style was not a part of the problem, since his clear, straightforward, yet exciting way of writing was quite engaging. However, among other things, his complete lack of Star Wars knowledge completely ruined the story for me. What basically happens is, at last the first two storylines (Luke and Leia) begin to maybe have something to do with each other, while Lando's storyline remains completely irrelevent, and only seems to be there to give him something to do. Leia is still trying to hold the government together and raise her family, which comes increasingly difficult when the Yevetha (an upstart race, the Token 'badguy' of the series) kidnaps Han and tortures him in an attempt to get Leia to give in to there evil demands. Luke and his companion Akanah (YUCK) continue on their quest for her people, (she has somehow convinced Luke that his mother is not dead and is living among her people) and begin to stumble dangerously close to the Yevethan fleet. Now, first of all, I cannot simply cannot believe Luke's thought processes in this book. Really! He notices that the galaxy is on the verge of destruction, he THINKS about helping Leia out, but decides not to because of his promise to help this idiot witch girl find her people, and because his feelings are still hurt from his argument with Leia in the first book. Come on! Sure I can see sensitive Luke still smarting months after a scorching argument with his beloved sister, but to risk others' lives because of it? Also, speaking of Akanah, she has to be the stupidest most weak female ever to &quot;grace&quot; the annals of Star Wars. I can't believe Luke would everlisten to her complete pacifistic nonesense. Also, through this intire trilogy there Luke and Akanah had a completely and totally platonic relationship.  And then in this book, and for no apparant reason other than to drive me up the wall, they jump into bed together. Why? He doesn't love this girl, he just feels sorry for her, and maybe sees something of himself in her, and that's it! And then afterwards they go back to their platonic relationship as if nothing happened! I thought Callista was a bad girlfriend for Luke, but this Akanah has to even worse, simply because she wasn't even really a girlfriend!  I mean really, I know we all hated Callista, (I still do) but at least Luke had real feelings for her.  He had no &quot;relationship&quot; with Akanah.  There was no underlying tension or gradual development of these feelings.  And I mean anyone who knows Star Wars characters would know that Luke, being the heartfelt and sensitive guy that he is, would not simply jump into something like this.  Just look at his other relationships!  In not one of them is he out to have a good time or take advantage of a female, (unlike most guys) and he never even thinks about getting involved with someone unless he is certain they are someone he could spend his life with.    This intire section of the trilogy could have simply been left out, since everything she told him turns out to be a lie in the end, and Luke just gets hurt again. Anyway, nothing in this trilogy is even touched upon in later novels, so it might as well have never happened. So, I'd say the inconsistansies aren't worth it, so unless you're a true die hard fan (I am, can't you tell? :-)) I would definitely not recommend this trilogy.	2001-05-21

Before I make all the accusations though, here is the basic plot of the book. Lando and Lobot are on some derilict ship built by some weird species trying to figure out how it works. Leia is trying to hold the New republic together while tensions run high because of some species who decided to cause problems. Luke (having had a huge fight with Leia in the previous book) has completely cut off contact with her and the rest of his family and is off with some girl on a mission to find his mother, whom he believes may still be alive. Anyway, now that bad things about this book. First of all the three main storylines have absolutely nothing to do with each other! Even in the first book they didn't seem to corruspond with each other very well, but this book makes it even worse by dividing them up into three seperate sections &quot;Lando&quot;, &quot;Luke&quot;, and &quot;Leia&quot; and telling only one of those characters activities at a time. Also, I can't believe Luke would actually believe this idiot Akanah's lies and just go along with her. She is a weak, whiny, completely dependant jerk who cries every fifteen minutes it seems. And the whole &quot;white current&quot; thing is just plain stupid!  We already have one superpower (the Force, duh) why do we need another one?  After a while, Akanah's whining coupled with her constant self rightous attitude of &quot;all jedi are murdering barbarians because they carry lightsabers&quot; and her feeling she needed to &quot;save&quot; him made me want to scream and throw the book across the room.  Just who's side is this author on anyway? So, a summery of my perseption of this series would be the political stuff makes me yawn, the Luke/Akanah stuff makes me sick, and the Lando stuff has nothing to do with anything! Stay away from this one at all costs, unless you are a comeplete die-hard fan who has to read every bit of Star Wars fiction out there.	2001-05-21
US	47867897	R2UYY9321NRLY6	0553571745	336872074	Star Wars: The Crystal Star	Books	2	2	2	N	N	Bad writing style, lame villian, fairly good plot	Well, all I can say is, this book was written so simply and childishly that even a seven year old could understand it, and probably only a seven year old wouldn't see that fact sticking out like a sore thumb. It completely spoiled the story for me, at least, what little there was to spoil. I litterally had to force myself to pick it up and read it. Anyway, in this book, (which takes place ten years after Return of the Jedi) Han and Leia's three children (twins are now five, Anakin is three) are kidnapped by evil &quot;Empire Reborn&quot; minions who wish to corrupt there little minds while they are still small and vulnerable. Han and Luke are unaware of this since they are off on some mission and are out of contact. Leia sets out on her own to rescue her children, and once again disguises herself as a bounty hunter so she will be unrecognized (she's now the Chief of State, and recognizable by just about everyone) Meanwhile, Han and Luke run into one of Han's old flames and she leads them straight into the lair of a creature by the name of Waru, some sort of force sensitive blob who has inspired a fanatical following. Han begins to worry about Luke, who is becomeing increasingly withdrawn and generally depressed. Meanwhile, they both begin to discover that Waru is not everything it seems... Anyway, this book could have been excellent, but it's many faults completely ruined it. First of all, how many times are the Solo kids going to be kidnapped? I mean really, I can count at least five times, possibly more, that one of Han and Leia's kids, or all of them have been kidnapped or a kidnapping attempt has been made on them, and that's not even including the numerous attempts on Leia while she was pregnant with the twins in the Thrawn Trilogy! (which are by the way highly recommendable books if you like Star Wars) Enough is enough. Also, I hated the way they portrayed Luke in this book. Rather than being that cute, innocent, blondhaired, kind, yet strong farmboy we all loved in the movies and in better written Star Wars books (Thrawn trilogy, Truce at Bakura, etc) here he is weak, dark, disturbed, selfish, and seems to be in the middle of constant panic attack. Also, a lot of things just weren't explained well enough. For example, what is a Wyrwulf and why is it so important to Mr. Icon (or whatever his name was) and why should I care? Also what exactly is Waru? If leaving this last thing up in the air was this author's idea of leaving a mystery up to me, it was done very poorly. Speaking of Waru, it has to be the lamest villian that has ever scorched the pages of Star Wars fiction. I mean really, a talking, force sensitive blob of goo is supposed to be scary? I have to admit I liked Leia in this book though. For the first time in a long time she showed her toughness when she went against what everyone else said and did what she knew was right for her children. The averedge parent faced with similar circumstances would have completely fallen to pieces and just done what everyone else said. Also, those who have read Young Jedi Knights will be pleased to see the original introduction of Lusa, who a recurring character in the later books of the series. Anyway, I can't say I'd recommend this book to anyone, unless they (like me) are a die hard fan determined to read all the Star Wars books.	2001-05-21
US	47867897	R1HBVNPL258AFQ	0553572733	474750115	Before the Storm (Star Wars: The Black Fleet Crisis)	Books	2	5	7	N	N	Not as bad as some others, but definitely not my favorite	Well, I read this book with a clear open mind, (for the most part anyway :-)) and the first thought that struck my mind when I finished was well, this author knows nothing about Star Wars!  Nothing about it in any way fits in with the subtly developing storylines that seem to flow through these books, and the intire series might as well have never happened for all the attention novels that take place after it pay it.  Anyway, the basic plot was that Luke seems to be going through some early mid-life crisis or whatever, and he is very restless and unsure of himself.  This leads him to actually turn the Jedi Academy over to one of his former students, seemingly for good, and go hide alone and be a hermit.  Meanwhile, the entire galaxy is about to fall apart politically, as Leia struggles to raise her family and  hold together the government, which gets increasingly harder as this &quot;wronged&quot; species of aliens decides to rise up and cause problems.  At the same time, some magic witch girl hunts Luke down, and tries to convince him to help her find her lost people.  At first he refuses, but then he changes his mind when she tells  him she knows some information about his mother...  Anyway, besides lack of Star Wars knowledge in general, this author seemed to also have no idea whatsoever what characters he is writing about.  If Luke was a Jedi master, why would he be so weak and gullible and wishy-washy?  Leia is also completely mischaracterized.  Where is the strong-willed, kind-hearted undisputedly tough female we all loved from the previous novels and movies?  Here she is a mean, selfish workaholic who is so eaten up by her work she litterally has no time for anything else.  Also, I don't believe she would ever, ever treat Luke that  cruelly!  Just for wanting to know more about his mother!  I mean really, she treats him this way, and then people wonder, &quot;gee, why is Luke so depressed all the time?&quot;  And who is this Akanah supposed to be?  I have never liked  most of Luke's female companions (except Mara Jade) but this one  has to be the worst ever.  I thought Callista was pretty bad, and she was, but at least she had a scrap of something that might  be called 'personality', which is more than can be said for this idiot.  I can't believe Luke would believe her lies and just run off with this girl he doesn't even know!  And while the whole Lando storyline was interesting, it doesn't really have anything to do with the rest of the story, and only seemed to be there to give him something to do so they wouldn't have to leave him out of yet  another novel.  That's another thing, where's Mara, and why is she being left out of yet another book?  Anyway, unless you &quot;have&quot; to read all the Star Wars books, (as I do) I wouldn't recommend this series.  Not only does it have nothing to do with anything that comes before or after it, but it also completely mischaracterized just about everyone and everything.	2001-05-09

This book follows the excellent tradition of Tales from Mos Eisley Cantina, as it tells the individual stories of several of the bounty hunters who have haunted the galaxy so long.  Though I  wish the stories had been a little shorter and that there had been more of them, it was in general a good, well organized, and highly enjoyable book, with stories written by talented authors. They are:<br />Therefor I am: The Tale of IG-88, an interesting story that tells of how IG-88 was activated, and follows several of his adventures, all the while exploring what it might be to be a droid.<br />Payback: The Tale of Dengar, a surprisingly heartwarming story that finally explains why Dengar hates Han so much, and his feeling as he slowly overcomes his hatred and learns to love again.<br />The Prize Pelt: The Tale of Bossk, not so much about Bossk as about two of his &quot;prey&quot;, still a good story, with well developed characters that are easy to understand.<br />Of Possible Futures: The Tale of Zuckass and 4-LOM, one of the more boring stories, still good though, very pleasing ending.<br />The Last One Standing: The Tale of Boba Fett, possibly the best story in the book, it spans a number of years, ranging from when Fett himself was a young man, to some fifteen years after Return of the Jedi.  Major cliffhanger ending!<br />Anyway, while they are long I would say this book is definitely worth the effort, especially the last one!	2001-05-06

When I first read The Golden Compass, and then The Subtle Knife, I was completely drawn in by not only the discriptive writing style, but the compelling characters as well.  I waited for two long years for this third book to finally come out, and I wasn't disapointed. (well, not much anyway)  It once again took me back to this fascinating world, and once again succeded in making me long for my own Daemon!  This book not only lived up to the first two, but even surpassed them all the while giving fine closure to the series.  Anyway, in this book Will is called by angels to go and fight at Lord Asriel's side as he wages his epic war against god and heaven itself, but instead he goes to the aid of his friend Lyra, who has been kidnapped by those Will believes may want to destroy her.  I won't say anything else because I simply can not bring myself to spoil if for you, but take my word for it; this is one heck of a series!  However, I think this is a book I will definitely read again in four of five years, because often I could not shake the sensation  that some of the sybolism and such was going over my head...  Also, while the Will/Lyra thing was sweet, it was somewhat (forgive me) unbeleivable.  I mean really, eleven and twelve year  olds falling deeply in love?  Get real!  Also, I would have liked to see more if the action focusing on the battle of heaven and earth, that was the climax of the series wasn't it?  Or am I once again missing something here?  Anyway, besides those things this was an excellent book, though I would mostly recommend it to  teenagers and adults.  Also most definitely read the first to prior two this one, since otherwise it will make little or no sense.	2001-05-06
US	47867897	R1IYQP0CEBBDHM	0064405257	74849191	Dragon War	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great finish to the series!	Well, I have to say that this book finally pulled it off, it gave the entire series a fine and exciting closure with plenty of  action, yet not losing its powerful sense of characters.  The whole saga together combines fine mythology with a highly original sense of magic and plenty of action scenes balancing it all perfectly with the cast of characters.  Anyway, in this final  installment of the series, Monkey tells the tale once again as they continue to try to regain the cauldron (holding the spirit of their friend Thorn) so they can use it to restore the Inland Sea, and fight against the evil Boneless King.  One thing I loved  was that this was possibly one of most unusual fantasy stories I  have ever read (where else would you find main characters that include a dragon princess, a magical monkey, a teenage witch, and two human children?) and yet, none of the characters fall into stereotypes and they all maintain their unique personalities throughout the book.  Also, this is one of the few books I've read where male and female characters treat each other with respect, and their doesn't seem to be any prejuduses among the main characters.  Anyway, all I can say is that if you love fantasy, definitely read this book, though it would be better understould of you've read the previous three (all of them just as good!).	2001-04-30

I am generally pretty leniant with books of all types, and I rarely rate a book one or two stars, but this, THIS horror simply must be exposed! To be fair, I will say that the writing isn't the problem. I enjoy this author's emotional and discriptive style, and I think she is very talented, but this book simply has too many flaws to be rated any higher, and I shall go into them in a moment. Anyway, what basically happens in this book is that the Emperor left behind yet another super weapen (this one is called the Eye of Palpitine) and it has somehow been activated and is heading to a certain planet where the jedi once hid their spouses and children, (hence, the Children of the Jedi) and seems to be preparing to destroy it. Han and Leia head to the planet to check it out, but basically do nothing but hang around and &quot;repair their relationship&quot; (talk about boring). Meanwhile, Luke and a few of his little Jedi pals head to the Eye itself (talk about stupid!) and spend the rest of the book wandering around looking for each other. Luke, seperated from his compainions eventually discovers the spirit of a long dead Jedi girl called Callista locked in the computer and he soon falls in love with her. So from that point forward he is in constant turmoil as to whether he should complete his mission and destroy the Eye, and Callista with it, or let it and her live (live? she's already dead!) and put the rest of the galaxy in danger. As you can probably guess there is a happy ending, but not for me because my main problem with this book (and I'm not the only one) was Callista! She is the absolute worst girlfriend anyone could have come up with for Luke! Even Gaeriel was better, and I didn't like her much either. Callista is a weak, stupid, cowardly, whining, idiotic, brainless twit. She had her life, she lived it, she died, she should not have a second chance. And, as another reviewer pointed out, she only has one aspect of her personality, Luke's girlfriend. Some other people on here have said things like &quot;Oh, it's so romantic, Luke and Callista fell in love before they could even see or touch each other&quot; but anyone who has actually read the book can tell that that's not true. Luke basically considered her an interesting phenomenon until he slipped off into a fevered dreamworld (brought on by his wounds) and saw her as she was before she died. This surprised and annoyed me because Luke is not shallow in that way like most real men are. AND, even though when she came back she got a young and beautiful body, she is technically old enough to be his mother! And wouldn't Luke feel just a LITTLE strange afterwards getting close to a woman stuck in the body of not only someone he used to know, but someone who was one of his students!?! And I simply cannot forgive this author completely mischaracterizing the incredible Mara Jade! She was not 'drawn to' the Emperor. He sensed her through the force and kidnapped her as a small child so he could train her to be The Emperor's Hand. Zahn made it so obvious that he wanted Mara and Luke to end up together eventually, that this author seemed to feel she had to make Mara as unapeeling as possible so she would no longer be a temptation, therefor leaving the way open for the hated Callista to steal Luke away. My only comfort is that Callista and Luke are together for only one other book besides this one, and once she dumps him he comes to his senses and marries Mara a few years later.(YES!!) Also, this author portrayed the characters all wrong physically too. Leia does not have auburn hair, nor does Han have hazel eyes, and since when has Luke had a scar across his cheek from where the ice wompa got him on Hoth? He looked fine to me in Return of the Jedi. Very fine actually...:-) Anyway, this series is not really neccecary to the overall story, though if you want to know who Callista is for future reference or &quot;have&quot; to read all the Star Warsbooks (as I do) then I guess you should read it. If your just a casual fan though, and or hate romance (like me) stay away at all costs and read something good like Heir to the Empire.	2001-04-22
US	47867897	R1HSHFH4SXBEZF	0345413369	872660777	The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials, Book 2)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An excellent follow-up! Almost as good as the first one!	When I first read this book when I was twelve or thirteen I didn't think it nearly as good as it's explosive predeceser The Golden Compass, mostly because I liked the character of Lyra quite a  bit, and seeing most of the focus suddenly switch to this new character Will, (who at that time in mind was only a replacement for her other friend who died in The Golden Compass) was quite annoying.  However, now that I've read it again I see that it was not as bad as I thought and in fact, rivaled The Golden Compass itself as far as character development and plot went.  Anyway, in this book Will steps from his own world (our world) into a new one by chanceing upon a &quot;window&quot; from his universe into another one.  There, in Cittagaze, as it's called he meets up with Lyra and her daemon Pantalaimon and they develop  a fast, though somewhat shaky friendship which continues to grow  throughout the book.  They soon discover the intire world is ruled by children, since as soon as they reach puberty the &quot;specters&quot; can get them and devour their souls.  Meanwhile, in Lyra's world, Lee Scoresby is traveling around the North in dangerous Tarter country to try to find Grumman, an explorer who holds a certain secret they may need...  Anyway, this was a great  book that I enjoyed quite a bit, and understood a lot better now  that I'm older.  My only minor gripe is that Mrs. Coulter and especially Lord Asriel weren't in the book much, and I love them!  Even though they're the bad guys pretty much, they are still fun and likeable characters who I sorely missed.  Especially  Asriel!  Luckily though, I'm now about halfway through The Amber  Spyglass, so I know he does return, the plot just didn't involve  him much in this book.  However, though these are supposed to be  children's books I wouldn't recommend them to anyone under thirteen or so, because not only can they be violent at times, but also I doubt a child of eleven or twelve would be able understand what was goingon even, because of the highly cognitive writing style.	2001-04-17
US	47867897	R1EFDJTWO6CC48	0345413350	994627826	The Golden Compass (His Dark Materials, Book 1)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Still one of the best books ever, even the third time around	This book is a truly original classic.  I read it for the first  time when I was about twelve, and while some parts of it were a bit much for me then, I loved it!  I read it twice after that, and now that I'm fifteen a lot that I didn't get before has come much clearer to me.  The book lost none of it's suspensfullnes or  generally exciting theme, so that at some points I was litterally sitting on the edge of my seat wondering if maybe this time would turn out differently.  Also, I've been an avid reader of fantasy for as long as I could read, (and even before that) so I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book would have none of it.  Completely in a league of it's own!  Anyway, this book is  set in an alternative universe, where everyone has their own daemon, (basically a physical embodiment of the person's soul in the form of whatever animal they themselves are most like) and through the Aurora flows the magical Dust, which is the subject of much contraversy.  Young Lyra Belaqua, abandoned by her parents at a young age lives at Jordon College in Oxford, and accidentally hears her uncle and the college masters talking about Dust, and before she knows it, she is launched into the adventure  of a lifetime.  Traveling to the North with the help of Gyptions, armored bears, witches and the like, Lyra comes to realize some pretty startling things about herself and Dust, and how it all ties into the Gobblers, who steal children to cut their  Daemons away from them.  By the end of the first chapter of this  book I was thouroghly engrossed, and by the end of the book I was longing for my own Daemon!  Anyway, I would recommend this book not just to children but to adults as well, since I doubt any child under twelve would be able to read it anyway.  This book is gory at some points, and some of the things this book hints at can be pretty disturbing, another reason why I recommend this book mostly to adults and teenagers.  I garentee though, once you read this book you will be hooked for the trilogy.  I've been waiting for The Amber Spyglass (the final book in the trilogy) to come out for two years, and I finally have it (one reason why I read this book once again) and intend to read it as soon as I finish The Subtle Knife for the  second time.	2001-04-14
US	47867897	R3QTDOHCJW63S6	0553575171	145330012	Planet of Twilight (Star Wars)	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Pretty awful, but not as bad as Children of the Jedi	While I didn't hate this book as much as Children of the Jedi, (no doubt because of the general absense of Callista) it most certainly &quot;made up&quot; for it in other ways, such as setting such a slow and boring pace that even I (a person who normally enjoys characters more than action anyway) had a difficult time finishing it and I litterally had to force myself to read it.  All the characters are skewed as well, as I shall further explain  in a moment.  Anyway, the basic plot was that Leia is on some mission to some planet, but is soon captured and kept constantly drugged to cloud her thinking.  Luke is still brooding and pineing over Callista and he finally tracks her down to a dirtball planet called Nom Chorios.  Han basically sits at home and worries and takes care of his kids.  And that is basically all that happens! Except for the last chapter or two which had a pretty good conclusion, which I won't go into at the moment for those of you who havn't read it yet (if it really matters).  Now,  the problems of this book are well, just about everything!  First of all, Leia is totally weak, she is meant to be a Jedi!  She is one of the twins, the chosen ones!  Why is this so much of  a problem for her?  Luke disapointed me as well, and he is usually my favorite character (aside from Mara Jade).  All he does is wail and lement over Callista!  Why would he waste a whole year of his life searching for this idiot?  She was stupid enough to dump him in the first place (Luke Skywalker! The perfect guy!) Luke should have just given up and moved on.  Also I have said it before and I'll say it again, Callista is the worst girlfriend they could possibly have come up with for Luke!  She never should have been brought into the story at all since at the time Children of the Jedi was written, several Star Wars books taking place after it had already been written and she is never mentioned in them, so her only purpose is so that Luke can be miserable over a girl again.  I felt sorry for him, not for Callista's sake, but because he can't yet see that this is better for him in the long run...(hint Mara Jade)  Callista couldn't even face Luke to tell him why she &quot;had&quot; to leave him.  Instead she tries to make Leia do it!  And I thought it couldn't get any worse!  They should have just let her die in Darksaber, since a nobel end like that might have made me actually respect her a bit, not as Luke's girlfriend, but as a marginally strong female.  Keeping her alive, and Luke in constant agony throughout the book, just adds to my contempt for her.  Also speaking of agony, what is it about this author and Luke and pain in general?  She seems to need somehow to keep him suffering for some reason.  In Children of the Jedi she plagued him with physical ailments, (broken leg, concusion, etc..) and in this book she keeps him in emotional anguish the whole time.  Why?  This is all a true shame, since I truly enjoy this author's writing style, and I think she is truly talented, but those things mentioned above really ruined the book for me.  Anyway, if you really need to know who Callista is or if you are bent on reading all the Star Wars books (as I am) then I suppose you should read it, but if you are just a casual fan, definitely skip it and read Heir to the Empire or something.  Actually, read anything else!	2001-04-12
US	47867897	R28IS43JFKRORK	0553576119	469367834	Darksaber (Star Wars)	Books	2	3	4	N	N	Aaaargh, torture!!!!	Actually, to be fair this book was not nearly as horrible as Children of the Jedi, most specificly because the entire focus of the book was not the bogus Luke/Callista relationship. (YUCK) I'll go more into that in a moment, but first here is the basic plot of the book: The Hutts are causing trouble once again, this time by trying to build their own Death Star. Admiral Daala has also resurfased, this time with the unfortunately more competent Pelleaon on her side. Leia is meanwhile trying desperately to balance her duties as the Chief of State with being a wife and mother, and to say the least, she's doing a great job. Meanwhile Luke is still trying to find a way to restore the Jedi powers of his new girlfriend, Callista. Okay, now the bad things about this book: First of all, I thought that way too much time was wasted on the bad guys. It seemed like more than half the book was spent on Admiral Daala arguing with other Imperial warlords, and the Hutts building their new Death Star. That's another thing, why do we need a new Death Star? What is this number four? Enough is Enough! And we can't of course forget the most horrendous problem of all, which is Callista herself! She is the worst possible love interest anyone could have possibly created for him. All through the book it kept saying how when Luke and Callista had been connected through the Force (before she lost her powers) they had known that they were meant for each other and that their personalities fit, but anyone with the least bit of character sense can see that this is not true. Nothing Luke does is good enough for her! She is an ungrateful, jealous, selfish, whiny, weepy, weak female who casts a shallow and dim light on all Star Wars women. Yet somehow through all this she somehow manages to be a sickeningly goody, goody two-shoes. I was seriously hoping (praying actually) that Daala would just blow her empty head off and end her pointless life, but unfortunately I did not get my wish. Luke is too goodfor her! He would do anything, ANYTHING to help her and make her happy, because he loved her. If Callista had truly loved Luke it wouldn't have mattered if she had her force powers or not, being with him would be the most important thing. Okay, good things about this book: First of all Mara Jade (my favorite character) was in it, and, though she basically had only a brief cameo, it was put to good use. She actually comes dangerously close to trying to flirt with (or hit on?) Luke. I suspected right from Heir to the Empire that there was a relationship in store for them in the future, and this book seemed to build on that theme slightly, despite the fact that Callista is Luke's girlfriend in this and Mara knew that as well as anyone else.  Though this does make her seem like somewhat of a loose women (which Mara is NOT when under her creater's pen) even so, I was cheering for her the whole way.  How was she supposed to know she'd me married to him in seven years? She took the oportunity given to her and I commend her for that.  You go girl!  Also, Daala seems to have improved since the Jedi Academy Trilogy, and lived up to her reputation a little better.  That however, does not change the fact that this book made it seem as though she lost the battle just because she was female, and therefor couldn't possibly have done as good a job as a man!  Ha! and people want to know WHY I hate this book so much!  So, to put it lightly this isn't one of the better Star Wars books out there, definitely not one to start on. This series (Children of the Jedi, Darksaber, Planet of Twilight) isn't neccecary to the overall story, though Luke does spend the next few years pineing over this woman so if you want to know who she is, I would recommend you read it.  Read it, cringe, suffer, and then rejoice when Luke at last puts Callista behind him and finds his true love, in Vision of the Future.  For the two or three people out there who actually LIKED Callista, well, sorry to dissapointyou, but it just wasn't to be.  Definitely not for fans who hate romance.	2001-04-11
US	47867897	R20QJI2LACDL0S	0553578731	253987847	Star Wars: I, Jedi	Books	5	0	1	N	N	One of the best Star Wars books I've ever read	I have to admit, I wasn't expecting much from this book.  After  all, how could an author just fit this new character into previously established events that he was not a part of?  In spite of this, the author accomplishes a seemingly impossible feat, and not only sticks this character in where he previously didn't belong, but also makes it BELIEVABLE!  I would say it even  rivals the original Jedi Academy Trilogy, (though I wouldn't recommend this book until you've at least read that) even though it focuses on only one character, and is to date the only Star Wars book ever written in first person.  Anyway, the basic plot is that Corran Horn, a famed Rogue Squadron pilot, is desperately  searching for his beloved wife Mirax, (a cool character in her own right) who disapeared on some mission for the New Republic.  To find her he is willing to do just about anything, including studying with Luke to cultivate his neglected Jedi powers, something he previously had no inclanation to do.  Eventually though, he gets annoyed with the way Luke does things and leaves,  only to go to even huger odds against bigger foes...  Anyway, parts of this book were very confusing, though that is mostly due  to my lack of knowledge about who exactly Corran Horn is, since neither he nor Mirax were ever mentioned before.  I've slowly gathered that his story, and that of Rogue Squadron itself is told in the X-Wing books, which I was not previously planning on reading, but now I think I will so I can find out more about this  fascinating character.  As for Corran himself, well, he seemed very much like a real person to me, more than most characters in books.  His complete and total conceited arrogance, as well as the general way he treats people (especially Luke) annoyed me, but at the same time his clever, humourous way of looking at things engaged me greatly, and I ended up liking him in the end dispite his flaws.  Part of what bothered me though, was that the  whole time he was going through his Jedi training all he does is  basically whine and complain to Luke about everything he is doing wrong.  I mean Luke is a Jedi Master by this time and Corran is barely a trainee and he still thinks he knows best about everything.  And he doesn't even complain in a nice adult way either, and is completely and utterly cruel to Luke.  What is  up with him?  One thing that can be said in his favor however is  that he somehow managed to earn the trust and even the friendship of Mara Jade, who as we all know is possibly the least  trusting person ever, even if she is the coolest.  Anyway, I would recommend this book to anyone, as long as they had read the  Jedi Academy Trilogy first, because otherwise it won't make much sense	2001-04-05
US	47867897	R1R61F38EMI8BR	055329802X	373475934	Champions of the Force (Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy, Vol. 3)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Pretty good, though some problems	First of all, this series is not as terrible as most people think it is.  Sure, it doesn't come close to the Thrawn trilogy but really, what does?  I would still recommend it to fans, though not before they've at least read the Thrawn trilogy, or The Courtship of Princess Leia.  Kevin J. Anderson is highly talented in his own way, and while this isn't his best effort, he  did a reasonably good job.  Anyway, this final instalment in the  trilogy picks up where the previous one left off, right after Kyp Durron (with the help of Exar Kun) sucked the life or the soul out of Luke.  All his students pretty much mill around in confusion until Leia and Han get there with their two-year-old twins to see if they can do anything for him.  Meanwhile, Kyp is continuing his murderous rampage by blowing up several star sytems with the Sun Crusher.  The token villian of the series, Admiral Daala, is also trying to find some way to cause damage with the New Republic, using the fully functional Death Star prototype, while at the same time, an evil ambasador who poisoned Mon Mothma is constructing a kidnapping plot of little Anakin, Han and Leia's other son, who is supposed to be safe on Anoth.  With all this going on at the same time, crammed into the same 324 pages one might be tempted to believe that it's pretty complicated, but actually it was an easy read that I finished in under two days.  One thing that bothered me was that the whole epic battle between the disembodied spirit of Exar Kun and the Jedi students seemed to be resolved too quickly, though I realize  that the book needed to move onto other things, they could have made the battle more difficult and discarded one of the other pointless plots, such as Kyp's &quot;redemption&quot;.  Come on, does anyone believe that a mass-murdering phyco with immense force capabilities who had shown himself emotionaly capable of destroying entire star systems would be let off the hook in any way shape or form no matter how sorry he was?I don't think so!  And even if they did for some reason Kyp did not deserve to live  after what he had done.  Certainly not to become a good Jedi.  I  doubt even Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine put together killed  as many innocent people as this ungrateful pig of an eighteen year old.  They should have just let Kyp die.  Also, while I was pleased to at last have a good female villian, Admiral Daala seemed to have no expertise in her field whatsoever.  Granted, she was stuck in a black hole cluster for a decade or so but still, she never felt very threatening at all, and certainly didn't live up to her reputation as a brilliant military commander fighting her way to the top after putting up with years  of sexism.  I mean she had the Death Star!  How hard could it be  to cause some damage with that?  Also, what is up with Mara Jade?  The way she talks and interacts to people seems pretty accurate but the things she does just aren't in keeping with her personality.  Why would she just give up on Jedi training so fast?  Mara is no Quitter!  Also, Timothy Zahn made it so obvious  in his trilogy that he wanted Mara and Luke to end up together eventually, that I have a feeling that Kevin J. Anderson's attempt to fix her up with Lando is just a neat way to get her out of the way so they can give Luke another girlfriend.  Since the Thrawn trilogy was the first adult Star Wars books I read I tend to believe that Mara Jade, and ONLY Mara Jade is the one Luke should end up with, so it is highly difficult to picture him  with other women.  To put it mildly, it drives me nuts!  Besides  those things though, this is a highly recommendable trilogy, that is essential to understanding Star Wars.	2001-03-31

Even though I knew what was going to happen (I have the guide to chronology) it still somehow managed to be suspensful and interesting.  It read the whole thing in less than two days, and that's having to squeeze in reading time on acount of school and such.  Anyway, for a brief summery; Luke has established his Jedi  academy on Yavin 4 and is in the process of training new Jedi.  Meanwhile, the secret is out, Mon Mothma is dieing of some strange wasting disease so now more and more of her responsibilites fall on Leia, which severly takes a toll on the time she gets to spend with her family.  Also, the imfamous Admiral Daala decides to mount a massive campaign against the New  Republic, who barely even realize she exists.  Meanwhile, some of Luke's students start taking dangerous risks and dabbling in the Dark Side without his knowledge, most specificly young Kyp Durron...  One problem I had with this book was that Admiral Daala was, well, dissapointing!  She didn't at all live up to her  reputation as a brilliant commander surviving in a sexist envirnment.  Sure she was cool and everything, but where are her brilliant tactics?  She loses half her fleet and only blows up one small group of settlers!  And she basically does nothing except lead pointless failing campaigns.  Also, I hated Kyp Durron right from the beginning, because he is just a ripped-off version of what would have happened to a young Luke if he had turned to the dark side.  A good thing was that they finally included Mara Jade, who is my favorite character besides Luke, though I was somewhat dismayed that she only stayed for about two  chapters and then left again.  I can't help but think that Zahn's Mara would have tried a little harder before just giving up.  Besides that, this is a great book that I recommend to any Star Wars fan, though it might be difficult to understand if you haven't read the Thrawn trilogy.	2001-03-29
US	47867897	R1B6XVMWLASBGR	0553297988	797236535	Jedi Search (Star Wars: The Jedi Academy Trilogy, Vol. 1)	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Great book, very interesting writing style	Well, contrary to popular opinion it would seem, I greatly enjoyed this book.  I read Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta's  Young Jedi Knights, and loved them so I was expecting a lot from  this book.  I'll admit it wasn't as complicated or intricately written as the Thrawn trilogy, but it was much easier to understand, and I finished this book in under three days, whereas it took me an entire week to finish each book in the Thrawn trilogy.  Yes, Zahn did an excellent job with his books, but that is no reason to hate all the other authors just because they don't write exactly like him.  Anyway, in this book (which is seven years after Return of the Jedi) Luke is somehow a Jedi master and decides to begin training other Jedi.  Meanwhile, Han and Chewie are off on some mission to Kessel and are captured and  thrown in the spice mines, where they meet young Kyp Durron, potential Jedi.  Meanwhile, now that Jacen and Jaina are two years old, they can come out of hiding on Anoth, so as you can probably guess Leia is very excited to finally be getting her children back where they belong, so she can really be their mother.  Han is supposed to be home in time to see the twins right when they get home, but he doesn't show up so she thinks he  is just galivanting around and gets very angry at him.  Meanwhile she is somewhat dismayed that the twins barely know her, since she and Han were forced to send them away as babies and could only come for occational visits.  She also has a hard time becoming an instant mother, and by now she is very worried about Han, so Luke goes out to look for him which leaves her even  more all alone.  Anyway, I thought this book was highly well written, and I enjoyed it a lot.  I was somewhat dismayed though,  that this book was written so that it is very difficult to understand unless you had read the comic book Dark Empire, which took place shortly before.  Luckily I had the Essential Guide to Chronology so that wasn't really a problem, but still it was annoying.  Also, what's with kicking Mara Jade out of the entire book?  After the Thrawn trilogy it seemed like she was going to be a main character and now where is she?  And another thing, why  would Han and Leia send their children away for two years, no matter how many people in the universe were trying to kidnap and kill them?  Sooner or later if someone looked hard enough they would find them anyway, even on Anoth, and seems to me that they would be safer with Han, Leia, Luke, Chewie (all formidable fighters) plus several thousand  New Republic guards to protect them in Imperial Palace.  Also, at times it seemed as if the author didn't trust me as the reader to know what he was talking about, so he had to discribe every detail of things that were already obvious just to make sure I got it.  Anyway, this is an important trilogy in the intire space of things, but a not a good one to read if your just starting out.  Read the Thrawn trilogy first, or The Courtship of Princess Leia.	2001-03-28
US	47867897	RYE6HSMPLCYW1	0553564684	252895440	Tales from The Mos Eisley Cantina (Star Wars)	Books	5	6	6	N	N	A great book, no major Star Wars knowledge needed to enjoy	While I am fairly well versed in Star Wars literature, this was  the first of the tales books I've read, and I have to say I was impressed.  It's amazing how many other struggles between life and death were going on at the same time as A New Hope.  Each story in this book is excellently well crafted, and it is amazing  how just about every character in the Mos Eisely Cantina scene not only had a name, but also an intire backround as to what they  happened to be doing and why by pure chance they happened to be there on that particular fateful afternoon.  Also, in order to read this book one doesn't have to be particularly well versed in  Star Wars, unlike many of the other novels, which are practically impossible to read unless you have read every single one that takes place before it.  This book only requires that you  have seen the movies.  The authors were chosen well too, and I recognized many of them as authors of Star Wars novels I have read.  The stories are:  We Don't Do Weddings: The Band's Tale, this is the story of Figrin Da'an and the Model Nodes, the band who was playing in that scene.<br />A Hunter's Fate: Greedo's Tale, as you can probably tell from the  title, this story is about Greedo the bounty hunter, and is surprising heartfelt and sad.<br />Hammertong: The Tale of the &quot;Tonika Sisters&quot;, at last I know what  a Mistryl is! This story tells of the two women masquerading as the Tonika sisters in that scene.<br />Play it Again, Figrin Da'an: The Tale of Muftak and Kabe, a heartwarming story of friendship and love.<br />The Sand Tender: The Hammerhead's Tale, a sad and haunting story of an exiled Ithorian caught under the heel of the Empire.<br />Be Still My Heart: The Bartender's Tale, ever wonder about the sweaty bartender who orders Threepio and Artoo out? this is a  surprising sweet story of how even the most hardened people can eventually be reached.<br />Nightlily: The Lover's Tale, one of my least favorites, but still  a pretty interesting story, very surprising ending.<br />Empire Blues: The Deveronian's Tale, a somewhat depressing story about the little devil guy hanging around the cantina.<br />Swap Meet: The Jawa's tale, an interesting story of a Jawa overcoming fear to take revenge on a pack of imperials, we don't get the true outcome until we read the next story.<br />Tradewins: The Ranat's Tale, a companion story to the previous one, have to read one to understand the other.<br />When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale, even Imperials are human beings, just like anyone else, learn the name  of the &quot;Look Sir, Droids&quot; stormtrooper!<br />Soup's On: The Pipesmoker's Tale, possible the most disgusting of them all.<br />At The Cross Roads: The Spacer's tale, the guy who Ben talked to before Han.<br />Docter Death: The Tale of Docter Eveson and Ponda Baba: ever wonder what happened to the guy who picked a fight with Ben?<br />Drawing the Maps of Peace: The Moisture Farmer's Tale, a sad, but  uplifting story of people like Owen and Beru.<br />One Last Night in the Mos Eisely Cantina: a fitting finale, and extemly haunting story.<br />Anyway I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, especially those just getting into Star Wars since it provides very interesting backround.	2001-03-28

For one thing it had more character development, and was in general better written.  Another good thing about it was that it had plenty of strong females,  Adi-Galia, Siri, Tahl, Ona Nobis, and Jenna Zan Arbor to name a few.  I was very glad Siri and Adi Galia returned for another adventure because they are both such cool characters that  deserved to be used more.  While I think that Ona Nobis could have been a much cooler character than she was portrayed here, this in no way undermines the fact that this book had enough strong women to satisfy anyone.  I still wish that Tahl would join the action again though, she has the force why does she think she needs her eyes to fight?  Anyway, in this book Obi-Wan (with the help of Siri and Adi) at last succedes in rescuing Qui-Gon from Jenna Zan Arbor, but there is still another Jedi held prisoner by her.  She leaves her planet and pretty much leads them on a wild goose chase halfway around the galaxy to try  and rescue the poor guy.  An annoying factor in this book was the continued existence of the three idiot tagalongs, Cholly, Weez, and Tup.  I kept wishing that Ona Nobis or someone would apear and blow all three of their idiotic heads off, but unfortunatly I did not get my wish.  I can only hope that they will not be &quot;gracing&quot; any future novels in this series.  Another problem I had was, while the book itself was great, it had tons of typos.  For instance, on several occations they referred to Siri as Astri, when the real Astri was on the other side of the galaxy, and the second to last chapter was labeled, 'Chapter 20' and the final chapter was labeled, 'Chapter 29'.  Why is this?  Am I missing something or did the editor fall asleep?  Besides that though this book was excellent, and I look forward to the next one which is coming out in June, unless I'm mistaken.	2001-03-24

And there are a lot of great books too.  However, there are those few that not only engage you as you read them, but that stick in your mind forever.  The kind you can never forget.  This is one those few books.  Though it is  set in the late eighteen hundreds, this is not a historical kind  of book, but rather, a book that brings forth all kinds of unanswerable questions of life and death, and is in fact very close to home.  In it, ten year old Winnie gets fed up with her sheltered life and runs away to the woods, only to be immediatly &quot;kidnapped&quot; by the quirky, slightly bumbling Tuck family, who fear that she has stumbled on their secret of eternal life, and will spred it around the world to be exploited by all.  As she comes to truly care for them, she is faced with several terrible decisions...  This book has true to life themes, blended in with fantasy undertones, and it brings up the fascinating question of,  what if you were offered eternal life?  Would you take it?  For months after I read this book I still thought about it.  I'll probably still be thinking about it on my death bed, but all I can say is that I have rarely read a book that had such a strong effect on me, and I've read a lot of books!  I would recommend this book not only to children but to adults as well.	2001-03-23
US	47867897	R3GVSWP1RMMYNT	0553560719	42812583	Dark Force Rising (Star Wars: The Thrawn Trilogy, Vol. 2)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An excellent middle book to the trilogy	While this book isn't as exciting as Heir to the Empire, and not  as immensly well written as The Last Command, it's still an excellent book that is essential to understanding the whole trilogy.  Since I consider this trilogy to be the cornerstone of Star Wars fiction, I would therefor recommend it to anyone, even  the casual fan who would just kind of like to know what happened next.  I would defenitely also recommend reading Heir to the Empire first, since otherwise this book will make no sense what so ever.  For those of you just getting into Star Wars fiction, this is a very good place to start.  In fact, I would even recommend reading this series before the ones set before it, since that way it will give a better general perspective of the overall story.  Several important things happen in this series that have a profound effect on everything that comes after it, Han and Leia  have their first children, Jacen and Jaina, the New Republic meets it's match (once again) and for that matter so does Luke.  Anyway, the story of this book in particular basically revolved around a bunch of space battles in which everyone is fighting over the Katana Fleet, or the Dark Force, which is a fleet of dreadknots (or however that's spelled) that was lost some time ago.  The smuggler Talon Karrde and his second  in command Mara Jade know where it is, and promise to give it to  the New Republic, something that makes Mara Jade (a former imperial assasin/spy with an intense hatred of Luke, and also happens to be highly force sensitive) very displeased.  Meanwhile, a pregnant Leia is on Honoghor trying to consolidate the Noghri into joining the New Republic.  Though, while this book is full to the brim with vivid battles of all kinds, there is plenty of character stuff to satisfy also.  Original and new characters alike are portrayed magnificently, both in their personalities and in their interactions with the other characters.  Another excellent thing about this series is that it  is the official introduction of Mara Jade, who is possibly the coolest and most interesting character in Star Wars.  Her interactions with Luke especially were superb, very fun and interesting.  When I read this book for the first time I found it  hard to believe those two were going to end up together, even if  it does happen ten years later, but now the second time around I  can see the subtle attraction developing between them.  I think this will be a relationship I will enjoy for once, much better than Luke's other relationships (Gaeriel, Callista(gagging noises))  Anyway, this is an excellent book that I would definitely recommend to any Star Wars fan, child or adult.	2001-03-20
US	47867897	R2KT2BH1KXET0J	006440398X	351229123	Dragon Cauldron	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A highly unique fantasy true to characters and storyline	Much as I love all types of books, fantasy has been my favorite for as long as I can remember.  So, considering that I have read extensively in this field, I have read all the cleshaes to the point where I can almost guess the ending two chapters into most books.  This series I'm happy to say, is in a league all it's own.  It's completely unlike any series I've ever read before, and I have to say I'm releaved that there actually is a fantasy series where male and female characters treat each other equaly, and female characters can be just as strong as male characters.  Anyway, in this book (which is third in this incredible series) Monkey tells the tale as the book picks up basically where the previous one (told by Shimmer) left off, as they continue their quest to try to restore the inland sea.  At first I was a little irritated at having Monkey tell this segment of the adventure; I wanted more Shimmer! but I quickly warmed up to him, and to the hillarious irony with which he tells the story.  This book was also largely character based, focusing a lot of the interrelations of the characters, as Monkey begins to build a bond with Thorn, a saintly young human boy, who is very jealous of Shimmer's favoritism to newcommer Indigo. (a human girl) This book also has plenty of exciting action and adventure scenes though, and tons of suspense, so fans of action will not be dissapointed either.  I would recommend reading the first two prior to this one, since it will make a lot more sense that way.  Also, I would recommend these books to anyone from ten years old  one up since in my opinion they are quite timeless.	2001-03-17
US	47867897	R39ZCLXQQC0UI5	0141303484	28702077	The Iron Ring	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A highly unique story, that draws deeply on Indian mythology	To say the least, this book is excellent, highly original, with fascinating characters.  Though it's quite a long book, both times I've read it I've finished it in twenty-four hours or less.  Lloyd Alexander has been one of my favorite authors for quite a while, so I was expecting quite a bit from this book, and I was not dissapointed.  Combining the rich undertones of Indian mythology with usual fantasy flair, Lloyd Alexander really outdid  himself here.  In it, the young king Tamar sets out to find the mysterious King Jaya, to whom he inadvertantly pledged his life.  Along the way, he gains a very colorful band of companions who include a bad tempered bird, a kind elephant, one of his old teachers, a mischevous monkey, plus a beautiful peasant girl Tamar falls instantly in love with.  As they head on their journey it becomes apparant that it is largely a journey of self discovery as well, as each character has immense character development.  One thing that annoyed me about this book was that it was not up to the authors usual standards of having plenty of strong female characters.  (I  will never forget Eilonwy, who made the intire Prydain chronicles for me) The only real main character who was even female was Mirri, and while she was clever and all, she wasn't that cool, and didn't even have a real part in the story except to be Tamar's love interest and sit and look pretty.  I also felt  that her relationship to Tamar was fairly groundless as well, especially at first.  Sure, towards the end Tamar learns to  love her for real reasons too, which is part of his development,  but the intire basis of his feelings for her revolve around looks.  Besides that though, this book was wonderful, and kept me  rivited to it right to the end. (which isn't at all what you'd expect.) Also, this book is somewhat more gory than some of his other books, so I would recommend it more to the 12-15 age range than the 9-12 age range that most of Lloyd Alexander's books are written in.That's not to say that younger people wouldn't enjoy it also though, as long as they can handle the occational violence.	2001-03-17

This gives an excellent depiction of A New Hope through Leia's eyes, giving an intirely new perspective to the story.  An especially good point is that not only does it let us at last know what Leia was thinking at this time, but it also gives us a bigger view of the intire story (ever wonder how Leia got the Death Star plans in the first place?) and letting us get to know the true character inside.  It was interesting to at last know what she was thinking, and the constant bickering she had with Han was hilarious.  I usually don't pay much attention to their relationship, since Luke is my favorite and I was always more interested in his relationships, yet this book shed new light on both of their characters and actually got me interested in them.  Also her early conection with Luke was compelling, much as it both intrigued and disturbed her.  Speaking of Luke, it's very interesing to see how he is portrayed in the different journals.  For instance, in his own journal he was portrayed as being an awesome hero, the star of everything.  In Han's he was seen as a well meaning dweeb, and here he is just plain cute.  Coincidence?  Anyway, I highly recommend this book to Star Wars fans of all ages, though 9-12 would probably enjoy it best.	2001-03-16

Now that I've read it again however, I understand it much better overall.  This trilogy, being the first authorized  continuation to the saga, is to say the least, the cornerstone of all Star Wars fiction.  Every Star Wars fan should read it at least once, preferably before everything else, even the things that are set before it.  Anyway, the story is set five years after Return of the Jedi, at a time when the New Republic has beaten back most of the broken shards of the Empire, but there is  still plenty of occasional turmoil.  By this time, Han and Leia are married and have twins on the way, and Luke is finally a true  Jedi Knight.  However, peace is not to be, because suddenly a new and incredibly intelligent grand admiral appears, and begins harrasing the New Republic.  The Imperials also win the help of Joruus C'Baoth, a dark Jedi, by promising to deliver Luke, Leia, and her unborn twins to him so he can turn them all to the dark side.  The Empire also gets some help from a band of smugglers run by Talon Karrde and Mara Jade, a force sensitive with a mysterious past.  C'Baoth calls Luke to him through the force, and Luke, not knowing what else to do, goes to him, but is intercepted and captured by Mara Jade, who has an intense dislike  for Luke, to put it mildly.  Anyway, this is one of the best Star Wars books around and I would recommend it to anyone, even someone who isn't a die-hard fan.  The author has a close-to-home, yet highly elequent writing style, and he portrays  the characters as if he knew them personally.  Speaking of characters, Pellaeon shows that not even all imperials are evil, and Mara Jade is arguably the coolest, most awesome Star Wars character who wasn't in the movies.  She and Luke are great together, even when they don't want to be, and let's just say I have a strong feeling about those two...Also, Chewie actually had a personality in this book, and isn't treated like some overgrown pet who has no feelings like he is in some other Star Wars books, but like a friend and family member, like he's supposed to be.  Also, while this is an adult book, anyone could read it as long as they have a good enough vocabulary to handle the writing style.	2001-03-11
US	47867897	R230GGRW996OO2	0553574132	967938127	Shadows of the Empire (Star Wars)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	A very good book, though some things were irritating	This book overall, as far as writing, storyline, characters, and intercharacter relations go, was excellent, more than excellent in some ways.  However, the book also suffers from  stereotyped villians and the all too obvious Han stand-in Dash Rendaar.  I read the junior novelization prior to this, and thought it was great, but reading this full version makes it seem almost silly.  This book takes place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, and basically focuses on the adventures of Luke, Leia, Lando, Chewie and some other new friends they meet  as they try to find a way to rescue Han from Boba Fett and Jabba  the Hutt.  Meanwhile, two mysterious persons put out seperate bounties for Luke, one wanting him alive, the other wanting him dead.  As you can probably guess this worries him and his friends  quite a bit, since Luke believes one of them is certainly Vader,  but who is the other one?  Leia decides to contact the major criminal organization Black Sun, led by the infamous Prince Xizor, to see if they can find out who it is.  She also hires smuggler Dash Rendaar to keep an eye on Luke, which further adds to the mess, for reasons I won't go into at the moment for the benefit of those who haven't read it yet.  One thing that bothered me about this book was that all the bad guys (with the exception of Darth Vader) were completley unbelievable and very annoying at some points.  Guri especially was a very stupid add on.  She could have been an awesome character, but the way she was portrayed is completely unacceptable by my standards.  She is  simply a man's stupid fantasy of what a strong female should be and is basically a parady of other, better super spy/assassin type women such as Mara Jade (now THERE was an awesome character).  Also, Dash seemed just a little too much like Han, and is obviously nothing but a stand-in.  I have to admit, Xizor was a pretty good villian because I found myself truly hating him because of what a complete PIG he was.I also thought that in this book all the characters were accuratly portrayed, even Luke, who a lot of writers seem to have trouble with.  I also enjoyed Leia's thoughts on Luke and Han, and how it truly brings to light the fact that she loved both of them, Han in a more romantic way, and  Luke in a more protective, almost motherly way.  Anyway, I would  urge younger readers to stay with the junior novelization of this book, since there are some scenes that younger children will  probably find disturbing, but nothing anyone over 12 or so couldn't handle.  I myself am fifteen and there was nothing in it  that bothered me that much.  Every Star Wars fan should definitly read the full version eventually though, and I would even recommend it to those people who are not die hard fans.	2001-03-06
US	47867897	R2OTUZWUBQPGOH	0553569376	28503180	The Courtship of Princess Leia (Star Wars)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	A funny, well written, excellent Star Wars book	Well, I have to say that I didn't expect to like this book nearly as much as I did, on acount of the somewhat irritating title.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was in fact an excellent book, one of the most entertaining Star Wars books I have read in a while.  The writing was skilled, humourous, and portrayed everyone well, so that I felt as if I was there.  Set four years after Return of the Jedi, in this book the sixty-three incredibally rich planets of the Hapes cluster say they will join the fledgling New  Republic if Leia will marry the incredibally handsome Prince Isolder of the Hapes Cluster.  She seriously considers it, and Han takes that to mean she doesn't love him anymore, so he kidnapps her to the planet Dathomir which he won in a card game, in the hopes that being alone with him will make her love him again.  What he doesn't realize is that the planet is crawling with giant rancors and fierce warrior women who use men as slaves.  Meanwhile, Luke and Isolder follow them to try and rescue Leia, and end up getting &quot;captured&quot; by Teneniel Djo, who is one of these warrior women, who decides to make Luke her slave/husband.  As to how this mix-up is finally solved, well, you'll just have to read the book  because I'm not telling!  One problem I had with this book was that it seemed to skip over too many years between itself and The Truce at Bakura, and then  expect me to know what was happening politically at that time.  Just who is this Zsinj?  Did I miss a book or something? He certainly wasn't mentioned in The Truce at Bakura which, as far as I know is the last book before this one.  Anyway, back to good points.  This book, I thought, portrayed all the characters with expertise, even Luke, who a lot of authors seem to have trouble with.  Also, this book actually made me gain some interest in Han and Leia's relationship, which I previously ignored, since because Luke was always my favorite character I was always more interested in his relationships. (hint: Mara Jade) This book though, effectively brought out both of Han and Leia's hotheaded personalities, and very well illustrated  the essencse of their often rocky relationship.   Also, going back to Luke's relationships, his 'almost, sort of, mutual like' he had with Teneniel was something I found more funny than annoying and frustrating like I have found many of his other relationships.  (Aka Gaeriel and Callista, (loud gagging noises))  I also knew from the beginning that Teneniel was going to end up with _______ because their daughter, Tenel Ka was one of the main characters in the series, Young Jedi Knights.      Another thing I loved about this book was that Dathomir was such a cool planet.  A planet full of warrior women who ride rancors and wield primitive weapons.  Can it get any cooler? I doubt it!  Anyway, I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, especially those who want to see how Han and Leia finally get married.	2001-03-02

Though there are still things I don't like (too much swearing, too much inuendo, etc) the basic story and the writing are getting better.  In this segment of the adventure we have circled back to David so he tells the story as the five kids (David, Christopher, April, Jalil, and Senna) continue their adventure.  The story basically picks up right where the last one left off, as they are facing the dragon Nidoggher.  He replaces David, Christopher, April and Jalil's hearts with rubies that will keep them alive for no more than six days, and in that time period they have to go and get a few of Nidoggher's things that were stolen by Leprechaens, and then if they succeed he will give them their hearts' back.  So, they head in the direction of Fairy Land and along the way meet a  nymph, some satyrs and plenty of other interesting characters.  This book was somewhat less intense than the previous four, and it was even somewhat lighthearted at times, a welcome change from the depressing direction the earlier books were taking.  This one  made me truly eager also to read the next one as soon as I can find it, though that should be hard because I live on a cold, miserable Alaskan island where we are lucky even to have a Walmart, much less even a mediocore bookstore. Oh Well.  The major cliffhanger remains, what will happen to them in the land of Ka Anor?  I have a feeling that Ka Anor and the Hetwan are the  real villians and that eventually that will dominate the storyline even more than the current 'will they find their way back to their own universe?' storyline.  I'm all for that!  I love epic battles.  Also in the future I'd like to see Greek mythology explored more and more spotlight on April, who is the most interesting to me so far.  David and Christopher are annoying, especially Christopher, and while Jalil is also a fascinating character it's downright scary to know what he's thinking.  Especially when they go into so much detail about his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. (shudder)   Anyway, this was a really good book, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who havn't read this previous ones first, since otherwise it will make no sense whatsoever.  Also, these books are very intense and  defenitely not for young children.  I'm fifteen and some of it still scares me.  I would definitely not recommend them to anyone  under 13 or so.	2001-02-25

In fact, I would probably have even rated it five stars if it weren't for certain faults that I will go into in a few moments.  The book starts the day after Return of the Jedi when the alliance suddenly intercepts a message to the emperor from the planet Bakura begging for help against a strange alien force attacking them. (apparantly they hadn't yet heard of his death) The alliance goes to help them fight these aliens (the Ssi Ruuk) and have a hard time convincing the strict, Imperial Bakurans that they're friends and only really want to help them.  (The hope of course is that they'll eventually want to join and help them fight the remnants of the Empire)  Meanwhile they discover the Ssi Ruuk are an even more formidable foe than previously thought,  while meanwhile Luke develops a major crush on the beautiful senetor Gaeriel Captison.  The book, judging it all together, was  excellent, better than a lot of other Star Wars litterature I've  read.  However, there were certain faults that I have to mention.  Let's start with Gaeriel.  Actually, I didn't hate her like I thought I was going to, and while she isn't my idea of a strong female she actually turned out to be quite interesting.  However, that doesn't cover the fact that she was a complete and total jerk to Luke.  Even if she really didn't like him (not the case) she didn't have to be so mean and hurt his feelings like that.  Especially since he was going out of his way to be nice to  her.  I mean this is Luke Skywalker we're talking about here!  What in the universe was she THINKING turning him down like that!  Also, when this book was written Star Wars history up to five and ten years later had already been written so we KNOW Luke isn't going to end up with Gaeriel, and basically her only purpose  is so that Luke can get his heart broken yet again.  Also, Luke himself seemed too much like he did during A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back and less like the mature Jedi he had become by Return of the Jedi.  I sincerly doubt Mature Luke would  have fallen for someone like Gaeriel.  Actually, it is in fact out of character for Luke to fall in love at all, at least the 'love at first sight, head over heels, puppy love' kind of way they have him do it here.  Oh, well.  Besides that though though this was a good book, which probably does deserve five stars except I had to knock one off because of Gaeriel's behavior.  There is nothing that bad in this book, and anyone could probably  read it, child or adult.  I personally would probably not have enjoyed this much if I was less mature than I am now (I'm fifteen) but that may not be true for others.	2001-02-24

This book exheeded not only my expectations for the book itself (which were very high) but even surpassed the  movie in some ways.  The author has a deep, highly emotional writing syle which apealed to me greatly, and was so profound that all through the book I truly felt as if was there, a part of the  story.  Every Star Wars fan should read this at some point, especially those who didn't like Return of the Jedi because they thought it was weaker than the others.  I could almost garantee this book would change their minds.  Also, the author did a tremendous job on the characters.  Just they way they were presented made me truly feel for them, even characters who were  previously not my favorites.  At times this book had me sitting on the edge of my seat actually wondering if maybe this time it would turn out differently, and the part where Anakin Skywalker dies almost had me in tears.  Anyway, I don't think think this book belongs in any particular age range, though probably some of  it (in fact a lot of it) would most likely go over the heads of people younger then twelve or so.	2001-02-24

Even so, I liked it.  In it, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are assigned to go to  a planet and stop an impending civil war between two closely related planets.  One irritating thing in this book is that while the story is told as usual by Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, practically the intire focus is on the secondary characters they meet.  Luckily though, those characters were interesting so it wasn't too bad.  Also, there wasn't much action, but constant battles have never been as compelling as characters anyway, so I could put up with it for this one book.  In short, a good book, but not the best in the series.  It will probably make more sense  if you had read the other books in the series first.	2001-02-22
US	47867897	R3SBR0SVFNMVVL	0590520806	693218761	The Fight for Truth (Star Wars: Jedi Apprentice, Book 9)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	One of my favorites in the series	This book was not the best in the series, but even so is one of my favorites for two reasons; 1, the introduction of Siri and Adi-Galia into the story (two of my favorite characters.) and 2, finally a complete adventure in a single novel with a well defined beginning, middle, and end.  Also, I liked it because it had such a different plot, as apposed to the often repetitive earlier books.  They go to some planet with a major problem, meet  some interesting (or not interesting) new friends, solve the problem, and leave.  Over and over again.  This book however, was different.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are paired up with another master/padawan team, Adi-Galia and Siri.  They are sent on a mission to the planet Kegan to determine if a certain child has force potential, a simple sounding mission.  Once they get there however, they begin to realize things aren't always what they seem...  Anyway, this book was great, and definitly one of the most entertaining.  The story is also deepened towards the end  from several interesting and cryptic prophecies, that I believe hint at the future empire.  Masked soldiers controling everything, a great darkness coming from the heart of the Jedi...  Hmmm, could be!  Anyway, while reading the ones before it isn't really neccecary to understanding this book, I would recommend it, since then the intercharacter relationships will make more sense.  Also, older readers should not let themselves be dettered  from this series because of the short length and obvious kiddish  intent, since, regardless of that, they are great books.  I myself am fifteen and I love this series, though admittidly not quite as much as Young Jedi Knights or some of the adult novels.	2001-02-22

I didn't think it was as  good as the novelization for Return of the Jedi, but still fairly descent.  FAR better than the kids' novelization, which I was bored with very quickly.  This book fleshed out the story of The Empire Strikes Back, while adding plenty of stuff that wasn't  in the movie, and generaly making it a more endearing story.  Even so, some of the scenes could have been better written, and it often felt rushed.  Now that I've read this though, I wonder why I ever wasted my time with the fifty-three page kids' version.  There is nothing in this book I could not have read and comprehended at ten years old, and I probably would have  enjoyed it more even then.  I wouldn't say that this as essential to all Star Wars fans as the novelizations for A New Hope and Return of the Jedi, but I would recommend it anyway, since it does shed new light on things.	2001-02-22

So, as you can probably guess my expectations were rather high, too high perhaps, but even so I was not disapointed.  George Lucas has proved himself not only an excellent filmmaker, but also a great author as well.  This book, while a bit dry at times, illustrates the movie  in a spectacular fashion, and breathes new life into it, so that  it seems interesting all over again.  I read it one day when I was stuck in a hotel room, but this book was so interesting I litterally could not put it down.  Every true Star Wars fan should read this, since it completly tells the story with a bunch  of added stuff, that truly flesh out the story and that were completly missing from the movie.  One thing that surprised me was the occasional small details that were changed.  Such as Threepio being described as bronze instead of gold, and Luke being Blue 5 instead of Red 5.  Another thing that struck me as odd was the slight differences in characters, Luke and Ben most noticably.  Ben is less wise, more mischevious, and at times even  funny, a previously unheard of thing!  Luke also is slightly different.  He seems, well, less innocent, more stupid, and even acts like somewhat of a jerk at times, and is all around more heroic and self centered, and generaly less cute.  This was both interesting and annoying, since Luke was always my favorite character and to be honest I liked him better the other way.  Leia is also noticably different, she being somewhat less strong, which annoyed me somewhat.  Anyway, this was an excellent book, that deserved an honest four stars.	2001-02-21

I'm glad I did, since, while the book is no litterary work of art, it is generaly well written and brings up some very interesting questions about what could have happened, or what might have happened.  The book takes place about a year after A New Hope, and was written before The Empire Strikes Back was made.  So, considering that the author had no idea not only of the Luke/Leia/Vader family ties, but also that Han was going to stay with them, he did an excellent job of gracefully avoiding  certain issues, and still creating a fairly plausible story, with no real breaches in standard Star Wars history.  The story itself basically tells of the misadventures of Luke and Leia as they go on a mission to an obscure planet to try to secure it's help for the rebel alliance.  They are diverted and forced to land on a slimy jungle planet, and they soon find themselves caught up with some local lady in a quest for a special crystal that enhances the bearers force powers.  There is a lot of interesting interaction between Luke and Leia, but luckily nothing happens between them.  Han is also carefully left out of the story.  He was never one of my favorite characters, but even so I missed him.  The only thing I was truly dissapointed with was Leia.  She was portrayed as a weak, disturbed, unapreciative,  middle of that time of the month, prissy little princess, who does nothing but complain and cling to Luke when things get dangerous.  She is basically an annoying character, which irritated me to no end, since she was always my favorite female  Star Wars character, aside from Mara Jade.  Anyway, besides those things this was a good book, not entirely neccecary, but in  general good entertainment.	2001-02-21

Oh, I like him, I just always liked Luke and Leia better, since Luke is a nicer person than Han, and is never a jerk like he sometimes is, and Leia is a strong female.  This book however, changed my opinion of Han completley.  Though I think the idea of him being interviewed by one of the monk guys in Jabba's Palace is silly, the content itself is excellent.  It brings to light a side of Han we have never seen before; a caring and vunerable interior.  This brings to the front not only a different point of view from which to see A New Hope through, but also Han's deepest thoughts and feelings, and how much he was really starting to care for Luke and Leia.  Though the writing could have been embelished at times, and I wish it were longer, it was overall a good book.  I do wish though, that all the journals didn't have to take place during A New Hope.  I would be more interested in knowing what my  favorite characters were thinking during Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.  Though this one takes place during the beginning of Return of the Jedi it still only tells the story of A New Hope.  Why?  Anyway, in general this was a good book and I would recommend it to anyone who loves Han, and even those who don't since it might change your mind!  This book would be best for those in the intended age group, though anyone could read it as long as they don't expect Shakespeare.	2001-02-05

It was better than Anakin's especially, since this one truly got into the mind of Queen Amidala, whereas Anakin's wasn't as good at bringing out  his character (what little he had) or anyone elses.  This one however, not only lets us get to know Amidala, but also brings out the other characters in a way that made Episode 1 seem much more interesting than it actually was.  It was fascinating to find out more about Amidala,(I didn't previously realize she was only fourteen, in the movie she seemed older!) who I found a very  intriguing character in the movie, though I was confused about where and when she was Amidala/Padme.  This book answered my questions about that also, tying everything together in a satisfying knot.  Also, I found Anakin's character much more interesting in this book than even in his own journal.  In the movie especially he irritated me, because he just seemed too cute  and sweet, but here he is much more likable.  This book would be  good for any Star Wars fan, especially those twelve and under.	2001-02-04

Especially since I was somewhat unimpressed with Episode 1 itself.  Oh, but don't get me wrong, I liked it, it just seemed almost exclusively geared towards the twelve and under audience, and didn't have the 'something for everyone' quality that the previous ones had.  I also didn't expect to like this journal because Anakin was probably my least favorite character in the movie, because he was just so goody-goody, and way too wooden and had no character development whatsoever.  This book, however, completely changed my opinion of him.  It went deep into his thoughts and feelings, all the while describing what went on around him, in a very realisticly done nine-year-old  way.  Some of the things he was thinking about were very compelling,  such as how he missed his mother, and how he worried about Padme/Amidala.  This made me like him more, overall, and even made me want to see the movie again so I could apply my new knowledge.  I would definitly recommend this book  to any Star Wars fan.  Though it is written mainly from a fairly  simple standpoint for the benefit of the averedge eleven year old reader, any Star Wars fan could read it as long as they don't expect an epic.	2001-02-04

Actually, I didn't think I'd like this book much, since Episode 1 is pretty far down on my list of favorite Star Wars movies, and  especially since it was about Darth Maul, who I hated because he  killed Qui-Gon Jinn, who I liked.  I was completly surprised when, not only did I find it interesting, but I LOVED it!  It drew me in totally, so that I read the intire thing in basically one sitting, and I simply couldn't put the book down, to the point where I actually got myself grounded for reading this book instead of doing my chores.  It gave incredible insights into not  only Darth Maul, but also the essence of the Dark Side itself, including some flashbacks into his training as a small boy, which  show how it can be so easy to make a powerful impression on a young child.  The overall plot of the book would probably make the most sense to someone who knows Episode 1 fairly well, which unfortunatly I do not, so much of what he was doing and why went over my head, but it was interesting enough to make me want to watch the movie again, so I could understand it better.  But this  didn't really matter at the time, since the most important part of the book was the insight into Darth Maul and the Dark Side.  Star Wars fans should not let themselves be deterred from this book because of its short length and apparant &quot;kiddy&quot; exterior.  This book is, in reality deep and at times disturbing, especially  I think for kids in the indended age range (9-12).  I'm fifteen and I had no problem reading this book, and I think that maybe it is geared towards older readers because of the fact that Darth  Maul is evil and this book does not hesitate to bring this to light, but it is in such a way that may be difficult for younger readers to understand, and even frightening to them.	2001-02-03
US	47867897	R146POPZ3O1UZA	0345434390	42452496	The Essential Chronology (Star Wars)	Books	5	8	8	N	N	An extremely well-crafted account of Star Wars history	To say the least, this book was excellent.  It told the intire story of Star Wars, straight up to the the New Jedi Order, and encompassing all the way back to 2500 b.b.y., (before battle of Yavin), in an interesting, comprehensive fashion.  Though I wish it had included more details of specific events, otherwise it was a fun read, and one that I didn't at all mind reading cover to cover.  I wouldn't, however, recommend this to someone who hasn't already read most of the material, since I had read very few of the adult novels, and now I know everything that happens from this book.  Oh well, at least now I know Luke doesn't stay with that Callista forever.  (thank the Force! I was never so happy when I found that out! especially since the one he eventually does marry happens to be one of my favorite characters) This is actually a very good book to have if you happen to want to skip over some of the books or comics or whatever, and still basically get the whole story, though I still intend to read them all eventually.  Another good thing was that this book included the Junior/Young Jedi Knights books, which for a while were my favorites and I hoped they would be included in the official chronology.  Also included at the end is a timeline of all Star  Wars material, (a bit difficult to follow at first, but better than nothing) and a map of the Star Wars galaxy, which was awesome!  I would recommend this book to a Star Wars fan of any age, since the writing style is easy to comprehend, and doesn't gear towards any particular age range, and of course, to anyone interested in seeing what happened before, during, and after the movies.	2001-02-03

I read this book several years ago because I LOVED the Prydain Chronicles, and to say the least, I was expecting something equel  to that. I realize now that that was an extremely high standard to set, but even so I was not disapointed!  I can never look at my cat in the same way again!  The story is about Jason and his cat Gareth, and out of love for his confused friend, Gareth decides to take Jason with him on his routine time travel journeys (apparently all cats take these) and to communicate with him in the human way.  On an epic jouney through time, they visit places  like Ancient Egypt, Medieval Ireland, Ancient Rome, and many others.  And through it all they learn a little something at the end too.  I would recommend this book to anyone with a bit of imagination, though kids ages twelve and under would probably enjoy it best.	2001-02-02

I wish that they had let me be Luke or somebody, intead of this made up character that has no place in the Star Wars universe.  Other than that though, it did a very good job of showing what it might have been like to be there, having those things happen to you and your friends.  Also, it bothered me that that in this book they took way too many liberties with the character of &quot;me&quot;.  They made &quot;me&quot; a complete wimp who cares for nothing but Himself.  Speaking of Himself, it also irritated me that they had to specify several times that &quot;Me&quot; is a boy.  I happen to be a girl and I find that offensive!  Besides those things though, it was a good book, but one that would definitely be best for those twelve and under.	2001-01-31

This books was excellent, considering the kind of book it is, and it really gave a clear picture of what it might have been like to be there.  Return of the Jedi has always been my favorite  Star Wars movie, so this book, perhaps for that reason alone it is better than the other two.  However, I still don't like that they turned &quot;me&quot; into a self serving idiot, with no courage or moral values, certainly not the sort of character I want to be.  I also didn't like that they specified several times that &quot;I&quot; am a boy, when I  (and many other readers I'm sure) am a girl.  And why did they have to make up this other character for &quot;me&quot; to be anyway?  I would much rather have been Luke or someone, especially since Return of the Jedi has always been my favorite because it has many deep turning points for Luke, and I always wondered what he might have been thinking and feeling during that time.  This book would be best for children twelve and under, though older people could read it as long as they keep in mind that it is a Choose Your Own Adventure book, and they don't expect an epic.	2001-01-31

This book was basicly a more exciting story, though at times it still felt like some key elements were missing, such as good character development, scene discriptions, and a conclusive ending.  The series does however seem to be getting better, and perhaps soon it be back up to it's previous calibre.  This book does however have something that many of the  previous books didn't have, such as strong female characters, namely, the bounty hunter, Astri, Tahl, and the scientist whose name I don't remmember at the moment.  The preview of the next book indicates that Adi-Galia and Siri may be returning for another adventure, which will please me, since I liked both of them instantly, and hoped they would return eventually.  I hope Tahl soon returns to the action also, since she is an awesome character, and she should still be able to fight even though she's blind.  Didn't Obi-Wan himself say in A New Hope to a young Luke Skywalker 'your eyes can decieve you, don't trust them'?  Therefore there is no reason for Tahl not to fight again.  Anyway, in this book Obi-Wan And Astri are waiting to hear about Didi, who was wounded  and diagnosed with a strange infection.  The healers determine that the only antidote is on an obscure planet, so naturally Obi-Wan and Astri head there to try to get it, and try to rescue Qui-Gon  who is being held prisoner by an evil scientist, though they don't know this yet.  Meanwhile Qui-Gon is not doing so well, as the scientist keeps him locked in darkness, as she repeatedly drains the blood from his body.  I would recommend this series mainly to kids thirteen and under, but older Star Wars fans such as myself can enjoy them also.	2001-01-30

The return of Tahl was cool too, since she was a character I liked intantly and I hoped she would be in more of them.  But still, I felt something lacking in it, that the previous books seemed to have.  Anyway, in this book Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are back on Coruscant to rest for a while, when they run into a old friend of Qui-Gon's and his daughter.  Before they know it, instead of relaxing and meditating at the Jedi Temple, they are caught up in a fast paced murder-mystery and a vengeful female bounty hunter (sooo cool!) who wants Qui-Gon's friend dead.  In some ways this book wasn't as interesting as the others, and in other ways it was, for instance, in this book there are plenty  of strong females, such as the bounty hunter, Astri, and Tahl. This was especially welcome since many of the previous books lacked these types of characters with the exception of the same stereo-typed ones over and over again.  Also, as far as the series itself, it is generaly written for younger readers than myself, (I'm fifteen) though I don't have any problem with them, since the simplified writing style is easily overlookable because of the valuable stories underneath.  Any Star Wars fan, even adults would probably enjoy these, as long as they keep this in mind.	2001-01-30

They go to a planet, discover some kind of a disturbance, meet some new friends, end the disturbance, and then leave.  Been there, done that.  The only truly climactic thing that happened was the awesome final showdown with  Xanatos.  Those aside though, this was a fast paced and highly exciting book that I greatly enjoyed.  The basic storyline was, against the wishes of the Jedi Council,  Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan,(who is now officially on probation, but who  has not yet been fully reaccepted as Qui-Gon's Padawan) head to Telos, the home planet of Xanatos where they hope to find him and  bring him to justice.  They find him sooner than expected and meet some new interesting friends along the way.  I won't go into  any more detail for the benefit of those of you who haven't read it yet, but I will say this; the ending is climactic and not at all what you'd expect!  Anyway, the series itself is on a low reading level, so young kids could understand easily understand them, but they are not written with a condescending tone, so that even at fifteen I love this series, and plan to lend them to my brother as soon as possible.	2001-01-26

I liked Cerasi, but I couldn't understand how his affection for her and his other new friends could make him abandon his commitment to the Jedi, and to  Qui-Gon. (crush if you ask me) But I was completly shocked when they simply killed her off in the last book.  Anyway, this book starts right after Qui-Gon receives a message from the Jedi temple that the turmoil has reached it's height and an attempt has  been made on Yoda's life.  Qui-Gon must put aside whatever problems he has with Obi-Wan and return to the temple.  As soon as they get there, Obi-Wan appeals to the Jedi council to take him back, though he knows Qui-Gon never will, and they completly humiliate him.  He is reunited with some of his old friends, and is soon drawn into a fast-paced mystery that tells of self discovery, and inner forgiveness.  Tahl makes an awesome appearance, and I have grown to like her a lot, and I hope she overcomes her handicap and comes back some time in the future.  I  would definitely recommend this series to any fan of Star Wars.  Though they are geared towards the twelve and under age range, I  think any true Star Wars fan would like them, as long as they take this into consideration.  They are much better than I personally thought they would be, on an equal par with Junior Jedi Knights, and perhaps even Young Jedi Knights in some ways.  They are deep and heartfelt, and teach many lessons that are sadly lacking in much of today's literature for children.	2001-01-25

Before this series I had read just about all the kiddy Star Wars  books, and I was just about to move on to the adult ones when I came across these.  At first I decided to ignore them, since Episode 1 is pretty far down on my list of favorite Star Wars movies, but I decided to give them a try anyway.  Boy, am I glad that I did!  They are truly awesome, far better than I could have even imagined!  Though they are geared toward younger readers than myself (I'm 15) the tone is not at all condesending, and the writing and discriptions are excellent.  The characters themselves seem to come alive and the story is very real and intense and even heartbreaking at times.  The author crafts each character with care and expertise, and this series brings out far  more in Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon than Episode 1 did, and it also gives us new insights as to what exactly Obi-Wan went through to become Qui-Gon's Padawan, and how truly heartbreaking it must have been  for him when Qui-Gon is killed at the end of Episode 1.  Anyway, for a brief summery, Obi-Wan, having left the Jedi to  fight for peace on Melida/Daan, begins to develop a very close knit relationship with the two young leaders of the revolt, Cerasi and Nield.  As they struggle to form a new government, Qui-Gon and his friend Tahl, back on Coruscant, are working to discover who might be the culprit of strange thefts that have been happening at the Jedi Temple.  This book in particular is very sad and intense, as  Obi-Wan sruggles with the fact that though he would like the  Jedi to take him back, he knows how deeply he hurt Qui-Gon and that HE will never take him back.  And we can see how Qui-Gon is struggling in turn to keep his mind on the problems at the Temple, though he truly feels bad for Obi-Wan when tragedy strikes.  I thought in particular that Qui-Gon was portrayed wonderfully, since this book made him seem like an ordinary person on the inside, dispite the fact that he is a Jedi Master.  Tahl is also an awesome character, and I truly wish we could have seen some of her before she was blinded so we could see what  a great warrior she was.  Well, I have no doubt that she can overcome this handicap and go on with life, much as Tenel Ka did after the loss of her arm in Young Jedi Knights, if anyone else has read those.  Anyway, I would recommend this series to any Star Wars fan, especially those interested in finding out what happened before Episode 1.	2001-01-24

I found though, that my instincts had  been wrong once again.  They are great! Definitly equal to other  kids Star Wars series, and even some of the adult novels I've read.  Though the writing does tend to be somewhat simple, and definitly geared towards younger readers than myself, this does not stop it from being deep and heartfelt, and certainly worth reading for any Star Wars fan, no matter what their age.  In this  book, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon head to the planet Melida/Daan, a world so caught up with civil war they can't even agree on a name  for their planet!  Their mission is to rescue Tahl, a Jedi Knight who disapeared there and is possibly wounded or dead.  However, as you can probably guess, things do not go exactly as planned, and they end up getting involved with the Young, a group  of children from both sides ready to use violence to ultimatly end their parants war.  Obi-Wan begins to be drawn away, caught up in their cause, and begins to wonder if he was right to decide to become a Jedi...  Anyway, this book was great and I recommend it to Star Wars fans of any age, especially kids twelve and under.	2001-01-23

I really enjoyed it, and I thought it had incredible character development and good scenery discriptions.  It is very interesting to find out what Obi-Wan was like as a little kid. (Well, thirteen at least) And in truth he is a lot like any other  kid, a bit uncertain, insecure at times, and it is also compelling to see how he tries so hard to please Qui-Gon, but he never seems to.  What he doesn't understand is that Qui-Gon is just trying to protect him from ending up like Xanotos, which is a kind thing to do, but for Obi-Wan a bit frustrating.  Anyway, in this book, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon continue their original mission  to Gala before they were sidetracked on Phindaar.  When they hear the dying queen's sad story, they begin to wonder if there could be another heir besides her greedy son Beju.  Qui-Gon goes to find this person, while Obi-Wan stays in the palace pretending  that Qui-Gon is still there and he discovers some very interesting evidence about the queens's condition...  That's all I'll say for the benefit of those who havn't read it yet, and I do encourage you to read it, though it would make more sense if you had read the other three first.  I would recommend this series to any Star Wars fan, whether you had seen Episode 1 or not, since frankly, I didn't think it was as good as the other Star Wars movies and this series takes place years before and really doesn't have anything to do with it anyway. :-)	2001-01-22

Well, I have to say that this was the best Young Jedi Knights book to come along in a while.  Oh, but don't get me wrong, they're all good, but a few definitly stand above the others.  Namely, Lightsabers, Jedi Under Siege, Jedi Bounty, and The Emperor's plague.  And now Trouble on Cloud City has joined the ranks of the great.  In this book, Lando askes Jacen, Jaina, Lowie, Tenel Ka, Anja, and Em Teedee to come with him to Cloud City to help supervise a new amusement park he is building there.  When they get there however, they find that Lando's partner has been murdered, and they set out to find who did it.  Anja knows of course, or at least guesses that her master Czethros is at work and she struggles on many moral points concerning her new friends, and her growing adiction to Andris Spice.  Actually, in this book I found myself softening a bit towards Anja, who I previously hated.  I still don't like her nearly as much as the other characters, but I began to realize that she is a victim is her own right, since it isn't her fault she was mislead and used and duped into Andris.  Also, this book focused a lot on Tenel Ka, who is my favorite character in the series, and allowed us to  get inside her, and see her thoughts and feelings in a way that has not been done since the masterpiece of Lightsabers.  Her reaction when Jacen fell of Cloud City was heartbreaking, and I'll confess, that the scene where they all thought that they would never see him again almost had me in tears, and I never, EVER cry over books or movies or anything.  I liked how this book  let us see how much Tenel Ka truly cares about Jacen.  Speaking of Jacen, his crush on Anja seems to have ended, which may in fact be what opened me up to her a bit, since I was always adamently against that.  Anyway, I would recommend this series to  any Star Wars fan, no matter what their age, even though they are generaly geared towards the 10-15 set.  Also, this book would  have a stronger effect on you and generally make more sense if you have read the previous twelve first, though if that is to much work, it is at least reccomeded that you read the one before  it.	2001-01-21

I was not disapointed.  This book had an extremly well thought out plot, exellent character development, and succeded in being the best yet, which is quite a  feat since the second book was so good.  For a basic summery, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are about to go on their first adventure together as master and padawan(still don't know what that word means), and they are suddenly hijacked and forced to land on the planet Phindaar instead, and they try to help the oppressed people their.  On the way they meet up with Obi-Wan's friend Guerra from the previous book, along with his brother Paxxi, and they go on an exiting adventure together trying to sneak supplies  out to the suppressed people.  I was wondering in the previous two books, did they forget that Obi-Wan had a brother?  At last in this book he is mentioned.  I first found this out in the Essential Guide to Characters, that Obi-Wan Kenobi's brother was Owen Lars, the same one who raised Luke along with his wife Beru!  Something I still wonder about though, and that I hope the books  ahead will answer, is that where exactly did Obi-Wan come from? What is his home planet?  Anyway, fans of all ages should not let  themselves deterred by the short length and the obvious fact they are most intended for young children.  I am fifteen and I love these books.  They are definitly  on a par with the incredible Young Jedi Knights and Junior Jedi Knights, (which feature Han and Leia's children) and even some of  the adult novels I've read.	2001-01-21

When I first noticed these books in the bookstore I was inclined  to dismiss them as 'just another kiddy Star Wars series'.  A younger, cheesier version of the explosive and compelling Junior Jedi Knights and Young Jedi Knights.  I must admit, I have rarely  been more wrong.  I actually started reading them, and they are as good, perhaps better than some other Star Wars books I've read.  Definitly on an equel par with Young/Junior Jedi Knights.  It is so cool to find out what Obi-Wan Kenobi was like at about twelve or thirteen.  Anyway, the basic plot of this book is that Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon arrive on Bandomeer at last and are about to separate and go on their own missions.  Obi-Wan is still a little sad and upset that he has to give up all hope of becoming a jedi because Qui-Gon still refuses to train him.  However, Qui-Gon is still facing some inner demons of his own, and they are compounded when his former apprentice gone bad Xanatos returns hungry for revenge...  Another good thing is that this book, and the one before it, flesh out Qui-Gon's character much better than  even Episode 1 did.  When I watched that movie I found myself really wanting to care about him, but the movie simply didn't allow us to know him well enough.  These books, however, bring out aspects of his character that were barely touched upon in the  movie, and make him a much more beleivable, much more endearing character.  It also sheds new light on the relationship between Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, and we can see just how heartbreaking it must have been for Obi-Wan when Qui-Gon is killed in Episode 1. I would recommend this series to any Star Wars fan, no matter what their age.	2001-01-20

It succeded in taking me back to the unforgetable land of Prydain, all the while deepening  the story of the Prydain chronicles by telling where some of the  characters came from and making the intire series make a lot more sense.  Kind of like how The Phantom Menace made the original story of Star Wars make more sense.  Each story in this wonderful book is crafted with such care and presision that it makes even the shortest ones seem like complete novels for all I got out of them.  The stories are: The Foundling,  An interesting story that tells of Dallben as a child, and the witches of the Marshes of Morva.<br />The Stone, A funny, lighthearted story of a greedy yet harmless farmer's unfortunate encounter with Doli of the Fair Folk.<br />The True Enchanter,  My personal favorite.  The story of Eilonwy's mother Angharad, and how she met Eilonwy's father.<br />The Rascal Crow,  A funny tale of Medwyn and Kadwyr the Crow.<br />The Sword,  A dark story of how Dyrnwyn came to be.<br />The Smith, The Weaver, and the Harper, A compelling tale of greed  and good overcoming evil<br />The Truthful Harp, a Hillarious story of Fflewddur Fflam as a king and how he aquired his infamous harp.<br />Coll and his White Pig,  An interesting story of Coll on his own adventure to rescue his pig Henwen.<br />So, I would recommend this book not only to fans of the original series, but also to people who havn't had the pleasure of reading  them yet; anyone could enjoy them.	2001-01-20

For instance, at first glance they might seem like typical &quot;teeny&quot; horror formula books, though if one actually reads them they are not.  Though they do fit very well into the horror genre, and they can be a little too intense, yet in other ways they really aren't all that bad.  It was very intriguing, and to say the least a little frightening, to see at last what Jalil is really thinking, since he has always been one of the most interesting to me.  This book, out of all the ones I have read so far was also by far the most frightening, and an extremely stressfull read.  The strange thing is that this stressful quality had virtually nothing to do with all the monsters they were fighting, instead it just bothered me that they had to go into such detail into Jalil's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  Does this really have anything to do with the overall outcome?  Or was it just there to  add a bit of close-to-home fear.  Well, they certainly did a good job, because even now just thinking about that is making me nervous all over again.  Anyway, I don't think these books would be good for anyone under at least twelve or so, because of the foul language and inuendo.	2001-01-19

I am beginning to get used to the interesting writing style of these  books.  They combine horror, (of which I am not much of a fan of) with epic fantasy (of which I am a HUGE fan of).  Though there is a lot of violence, it doesn't seem meaningless like it often did it the first two.  One thing I still have a problem with is all the foul language, though, that is how kids talk in real life (with the exception of educated me of course :-)) so it  would not be foriegn to the average reader.  One of the most interesting things about this book is that it is told from the point of view of April, a very interesting character in this series.  It is odd how different she seems when we can see what goes on inside her head, though, the same is true for all the characters.  Another incredibly cool thing is the general premise.  Imagine! A whole other universe where all the gods went  and created their own universe.  I personally think that Everworld would be my ideal place, so I don't know what these kids are complaining about.  Also, I love how all this mythology is blended into the story as well.  The auther obviously researched this topic well, because none of the stories have been  irrepairably warped or changed other than in small ways that would better suit the Everworld story.  So, in other words, I liked this book, perhaps better than the others and I would recommend this book to any reader over thirteen or so who enjoys fantasy with a bit of stressfull horror thrown in.	2001-01-18

These books are not what I'm used too, in terms of the foul language and violence and stuff, but I have no trouble handling it.  Though I think that they would be as welcome, if not more welcome in the horror section than in the fantasy section.  For parents, I would not recomend these books to anyone under fourteen or so, because of the almost  constant swearing and intense violence.  So, anyway, this time Christopher tells the tell as he, David, Jalil, and April all struggle to understand the paradox of Everworld.  It picks up almost exactly where the previous book left off, right in the middle of a battle, and the intire book pretty much consists of them trying to escape imprisnment with the Aztecs before they are  sacrificed to the Aztec god.  I thought it built nicely upon the  first, deepening the adventure, and also giving an excellent choice of which character to pick up the story next.  I had not been fond of Christopher at all before this, since he is exactly the sort of person I hate in real life, yet this book shows that even he has feelings and thoughts of his own that go beyond girls  and food.  It would be very interesting to also hear from April and Jalil, since so far they seem to be the most intersting, and I hope the series continues this book by book character switching. (I am  on book three so I already know that they do.  The next book is from the point of view of April)  So, an interesting series, and one I would like to read the rest of.	2001-01-17

While the discriptions were breathtaking and the action scenes highly intense, the characters, while well fleshed out, seemed rather unapealing.  Just a bunch of selfish slobs who hate each other and happen to be stuck in a strange universe together.  Actually, I found myself liking April after a while because she seemed like  a strong female and because she is a ...  and Jalil was also somewhat interesting, but I had no interest in David or Christopher whatsoever.  Also, the dialogue in this book is a bit strong, with lots of swearing, which I found annoying.  One thing that was great about this book was the actual premise, all the ancient gods leaving regular Earth and building a new universe.  Since I am well versed in mythology of all kinds, I understood many of the references to mythology quite early in the story.  This book's interpretation of the Norse gods was interesting, and I hope to see the Greek gods also later in the series.  It would be interesting to see this series' interpretation of them.  I also hope that these kids get 'better'  and come to be better friends eventually.	2001-01-16

I am generaly not an avid mystery story reader, so this book being the first in a long time was a bit confusing in the beginning, though I very quickly was swept up in the story.  This book had good, true to life characters, though in my opinion not enough descriptions of the scenery.  The basic plot was, sixteen year old Sally Lockhart goes in search of what a cryptic message she recieved concerning her fathers recent death may mean.  On the way she meets some charming new friends and discovers some fascinating truths about herself.  So, this book was not as good as The Golden Compass by the same author, but still interesting enough to make me want to read the rest of the series.	2001-01-16

Partly because a lot of the focus was on Eilonwy, though she was absent most of the book,(she has always been my favorite character) but also because it had great moral questions, and we finally begin to see Taran turn into an adult as he realizes as much as he cares about Eilonwy, he must let things be.  In this book, Dallben decides that Eilonwy must leave Caer Dallben because it is time for her to learn how to be a young lady.  He sends her to  the Isle of Mona, and allows Taran to go with her, at least for the journey.  On the way Taran struggles with his feelings for Eilonwy and his annoyance at Rhun, Prince of Mona, who is a bumbling fool, at least on the outside.  Through an interesting chain of events, Eilonwy is kidnapped, and Taran learns that she is betrothed to Rhun without even her knowledge.  They all go on yet another epic adventure to save her, as Taran must come to terms with his conflicting emotions.  Another amazing thing about  this book was that I didn't hate the love story part.  Usually I  hate mush because it seems as if they put it there just to be mush, and it rarely has any overall effect on the story.  This however, was completly different, and I was actually hoping they would end up together.  So, this is an excellent book that any fantasy lover would adore, though it would make more sense if you  had read the other two books first.	2001-01-14

It even surpasses The Black Cauldren and The Castle of Llyr for two major reasons. 1. The return of Eilonwy. At last! I thought she would never come back!  2.  Because we finally get to meet the true enemy Arawn Death lord, and because it had such a heartrending ending.  I'll even confess that the first time I read this book it had me in tears twice, both at the part when Flewder burned his harp so they could live out the night, and at the end which I  won't talk about for those of you who haven't read it yet.  The basic plot is Eilonwy at last returns from The Isle of Mona and shortly after all the usual companions are assembled, they discover that Prince Gwidion's sword Dyrnwyn has been stolen  (a very bad thing) by Arawn Death Lord.  They all set off on yet  another epic quest to get the sword during which we get to know each of the characters better, since this was largely a book of self discovery as well as having tons of action.  The ending is both happy and heart breaking and I really hated it at first, but  then once I thought about it I realized that if it had happened any other way, than the series wouldn't have been as powerfull.  I highly recommend this series to anyone, child or adult though definitly read the other four first, because it will have a greater effect that way.  My one problem was that the womanly training Eilonwy was forced to have in The Castle of Llyr seemed to have worked, somewhat, and she didn't seem as strong as she usually is.  But, other than that this book was flawless.	2001-01-14

Set one year after The Book of Three, this book continues the story and builds upon it, making it darker and more interesting.  Though not my personal favorite in the series, (that honor goes to the Castle of Llyr) I still liked it a lot and thought it even better than the first.  For a brief summery, Taran and some other  warriors head off into the wilderness to save Prydain from another evil.  Eilonwy is furious at being left behind because she is a girl, so she follows them anyway and soon has joined there little band dispite what Taran and the others think. (she was always my favorite!) This was a very good book that asks and answers many moral questions while having grand adventure schemes  mixed in also.  Eilonwy is at her best in this book, and so is Taran.  Another lover of fantasy would enjoy this series, even adults, I think.	2001-01-14

Don't get me wrong though, I liked it, just not as much as the others.  I thought it moved slower than the others, and also Eilonwy was left out of the book, and she was always the highlight for me.  Anyway, the basic plot of the book was that Taran at last cannot stand not knowing who his parants were, so he goes on a personal quest to try discover his identity.  He hopes to find out he is from noble birth because then he can marry Eilonwy, but what he finds isn't exactly what he thought...  So, in general this was a great book that asks the ultimate moral question and deals with the truth that it isn't who your parants are the make you you.  This is an excellent series that I  would recommend to anyone, though it would make more sense if you had read the previous four first.	2001-01-14

Before this I hadn't read much fantasy and science fiction,  but now that is pretty much all I read, since nothing else can quite measure up now!  In this story, Taran Assistant Pigkeeper dreams of adventure far beyond the boring farm where he is fostered.  He finds it sooner than expected, and is instantly catapulted into an adventure far beyond his wildest imaginings, as he and his newfound companions face terrifiying enemies, dangerous territory, and become a part of a much bigger scheme that is only just beginning to take shape...  Taran himself in this book was not my favorite character, that spot being taken by  Eilonwy, who is just plain awesome.  She does what she wants no matter what anyone else says or does.  This book was also easy enough, without lacking character development or action, so that I could easily lend the series to my younger brother who was 8 at  the time.  I would recomend this series to any young reader who loves fantasy, and even those who don't since this book might change their minds!  In my mind, this series stands far above Harry  Potter and many other less heartfelt fantasy books.	2001-01-13

I greeted this book with a measure of respect, and also a touch of sadness.  I expected it to be one  the best yet, and I was not disapointed.  For a brief summery, Anja finally admits to herself that she is addicted to Andris Spice, (a type of drug) and, though she is trying to quit, she finally can't stand it any more.  She steals Zekk's ship, The Lightning Rod, and heads for the spice mines of Kessal to get a few more doses to &quot;tie her over&quot; while she figures out what to do  next.  Naturally, the Young Jedi Knights go after her, and they eventually track her down to Crystal Reef, Calimari, and that's where the real adventure starts...  In short, this book provided a fine close to this final trilogy, with (at last) an awesome confrontation with Czethros and Black Sun, as well as coming to terms with the question of Anja's adiction to spice.  Speaking of  Anja, this book really seemed to redeem her.  I didn't like her at all at first, because of how much of a jerk she always is, and  because it seemed that she was trying to replace Tenel Ka, whom I have always liked.  She was better in this book, because she was at last admitting her mistakes to herself and to others and trying to set things right.  Also, while this book solved the delima of this trilogy, there were many loose ends left unsatisfied, and it didn't seem to bring true closure to the whole  series, except in the last few pages.  For instance, what ever happened to Raynar after the death of his father?  He was never one of my favorite characters anyway, but it should have been Zekk who was left out, not Raynar.  Now that Zekk is no longer a villian and his healing processes are through, we really don't need him anymore except to be The Boy That Jaina Likes.  I was never to enthusiastic about that boring relationship.  Jacen and Tenel Ka were much better.  Also, what happened to Raaba? Is she ever going to come back?  They should have brought her back in this book.  And I would have prefered it if all the Young Jedi Knights were together in their final adventure, instead of just Jaina and Lowie getting to fight the last battle.  Anja, Jacen, Zekk, and Tenel Ka are instead all under Crystal Reef destroying the Andris, and while this has as much to do with the main plot as anything else, they are not all together and that is the point.  Other than that though, there is nothing else wrong with this excellent book, and I would recommend this series to any Star Wars fan.	2001-01-13

I don't really remmember many details, since I first read  this a year or two ago, but I know I liked it quite a bit.  In this book, a wizard's cat beggs his master to make him a human for a short time, so he can see what it's like.  The wizard does, and almost immediatly the cat/man is caught up in all sorts of town problems, as he struggles to fit in, and win the heart of a pretty girl, he begins to see that humans don't always have it easy either...  I found it very interesting how the author managed to get inside the mind of a cat, and explore what they might really think of our world!  While I didn't think this book was quite as good as some other works from this author, it was a good, lighthearted  story that charmed me greatly.	2001-01-13

It was an extremly well written book, with a well defined, understandable plot.  In it, Jacen and Jaina and Anakin all go on a short vacation with their Dad (Han of course) to go and check out a really cool race on Ord  Mantell.  Once they get there they meet Anja Gallandro, a girl who hates Han because she believes he murdered her father.  She plays on his guilt, and somehow convinces him to go try to right a bloody civil war on her home planet.  Through an interesting chain of events they meet back up with there other friends (big surpise), as well as Anja who by the way is not only working for some evil smuggler guy, but also is addicted to some kind of drug.  I also find it very interesting that all through this whole series Jacen is hung up on Tenel Ka, and now the instant some other pretty girl comes into the picture, he instantly forgets she ever even existed, and I sense the same thing beginning to happen to Zekk and Jaina too.  This only serves even  more to convince me that these budding relationships were silly to begin with, though I must admit I always enjoyed Jacen and Tenel Ka.  As for Anja herself, well, she was cool and all but I found myself not really liking her much, and I just couldn't really care about her like I could the other characters.  She just seemed more like a glorified and somewhat twisted version of  an early Mara Jade to me.  Another thing that bothered me was that even though Anakin was with them throughout the whole book, he was practicly ignored and it seemed as if they somehow forgot about him at some points.  This was somewhat irritating because Anakin has always been my favorite of the Solo children.  Besides  those minor details though, this was an exellent book.  I also think it is cool that a Star Warsbook can deal with serious issues such as drug adiction.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Star Wars, though it will probably make more sense if you have read the previous 11 first.	2001-01-10

This does not however, in any way imply a lack of excitment.  In fact it was solidly gripping from page one right to the end.  This book was the last in the second cycle of Young Jedi Knights novels, and it was one of the best.  It basically takes up right where the previous book left off, with the kids, now fully healed, preparing to meet with  the senet to discuss the possible threat the Diversity Alliance may be posing to all human life in the galaxy.  Meanwhile Zekk goes to find Bornan Thul and takes Raynar with him because Raynar is Bornan's son and he would be more likely to trust him if he is with him.  They discover the human plague secret so Leia sends them (Zekk, Bornan, Raynar, Jacen, Jaina, Lowie, and Tenel Ka) on a mission to go and try to destroy the plague storehouse before the Diversity Aliance can get to it and  destroy all human's with it.  The rest of the book is an intense account of their adventures trying to accomplish this goal, but as to whether they succeed or not, well, you'll just have to read  the book, because I'm not telling!  I will say though, that it has several unexpected twists, one of which is very sad.  One of the few problems with this book is that Leia would knowingly send her children on such a dangerous mission.  Despite the fact that they are almost full Jedi Knights, that doesn't change the fact that they are her children, and I don't believe any parent would willingly send their child into such mortal danger.  My parants definitely wouldn't!  I must admit, I am getting slightly less resentful of  all these irritating little couples that are forming (Jacen and Tenel Ka, Jaina and Zekk, Lowie and Raaba, and of course Lusa and  Raynar).  Jacen and Tenal Ka are funny and interesting, and I have no objections to them liking eachother,  and Lowie and Raaba are plausible, though boring.  Jaina and Zekk are hugely boring though, and Lusa and Raynar are completly implausible. Even so, this was not overpoweringly bad, so I guess I really have nothing to complain about really.  In short, this is an excellent series of Star Wars books that are better even then some regular books I've read, and certainly more exciting.	2001-01-08

In fact, I think that this book is even better than the other three books in the second series of Young Jedi Knights,  though I generaly liked the first series better.  For one thing,  even though there is one more book after this one, it seemed to tie in just about all the subplots of the series into a flawless intertwining story, that is  much better than most people give it  credit for, just because they are kids books.  Anyway, in this story, The Young Jedi Knights (Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Raynar) finally decide that they have waited long enough for Lowie (their other friend) to return from visiting the Diversity Aliance and they must assume that he has either joined them, or is being  held against his will. (both bad things) So they take off to go to rescue him, but are captured by the Diversity Aliance (who is fanacicly anti-human) and thrown into the spice mines to slave out their remaining years in agony.  Will they save Lowie and escape? And if they manage to will they survive in the nearly inhospitably cold exterier to Ryloth?  You'll just have to read the book to find out.  One thing that bothers me, is  that when they ask Lusa to stay behind and cover for them saying  that they went on a mission or something, well wouldn't the adults imediatly be suspicios?  I mean they are just a bunch of fifteen year old kids, wouldn't the adults feel responsible if something happened to them?  Yet everyone seems to simply take it  in stride as a normal accurance untill Zekk and Lusa come forward and tell the truth for them.  Also, these budding relationships between all the kids, while extremly innocent, are starting to get annoying.  Actually, the relationship between Jacen and Tenel Ka is fine, it being fun and interesting to watch.  But do we really need more than that?  Now new characters  have actually been created just so other characters aren't left out of this, or so it seems.  Zekk in particular was never one of  my favorite characters, though despite myself I am begining to like him more.  I am still completly against him forming a relationship with Jaina though, despite the fact they like each other.  While I suppose Jaina does like him for the right reasons, they are better as friends.  Their so called relationship is not only boring, but also completly unneccacary.  A poor attemp to relate to teenage girls who would be reading this book.  I'm a girl, and I'm fifteen, but this still seems silly and unneccecary, as is Lusa and Raynar, and Lowie and Raaba.  Well now that I'm through complaining, I'll sign off by saying once again that this is a great book that I reccomend to any Star Wars fan, especially those interested in seeing how Han and Leia's kids turned out.	2001-01-07

In it, Jacen and Jaina's old friend Lusa comes to the Jedi Academy desperatly seeking refuge from the Diversity Aliance, an all alien political movement bent on destroying all humans, that she was once a part of.  Meanwhile, everyone continues to search for Bornan Thul who is desperately trying to evade capture from the Diversity Aliance and keep from them the information he is protecting, because if they get ahold of it, it could mean the end of humankind...  Meanwhile, Raynar gets a crush on Lusa and it moves him to do something for his family while his father (Bornan Thul) is missing.  He decides to go to Mechis 3 and take care of his uncles droid operation since he too seems to be missing.  As you can probably guess, everyone goes with him and discovers a startling truth.         In general, this was a worthy book to continue this fascinating saga that tells of the next generation of Star Wars heroes, though not the best in the series.  For one thing I wish they would include Anakin more.  He is my favorite of the Solo children (with Jaina as a close second) and it's not as it there is even a big age difference, he is only a year and 1/2 younger than Jacen and Jaina.  Another thing that bothers me is that who exactly gave all the kids permision fly around the galaxy by themselves?  Just because Tenel Ka has her own ship somehow gives EVERYONE the freedom to go where they please.  This does not sound like something that protective parents like Han and Leia would allow.  I myself am fifteen, the same age as the kids in this series, and I am not allowed to do these things.  Oh well, it is just a book.  Oh, and one more thing, I would not advise reading this book before the others in the series, because it will make absolutely no senseon it's own.	2001-01-06

Now that I am older however, and reading these again for the first time in several years, I have more of an open mind and I realized that this second series is in fact very good, and, while it doesn't have as much action as the first series, the character development is superb.  In this book Raynar's mother calls him to come home and be with her while his father is missing.  He does and is accompanied by Jacen , Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Lowie who wish to keep him company and give him moral support while he gets settled but as you can propably guess, things do not go exacly as planned, and soon they are all off on an adventure to Kuar to try and discover where Raynar's father might have gone, with the absence of Raynar, who stays with his mother.  Through epic battles with giant combat arachnids and assasin droids, they begin to discover that Raynar's  father could be hiding for more reasons than his reputation, and  that in fact there is a high probability that he is in fact hiding a secret that could destroy the galaxy...  So anyway, this was a great book, though it would make more sense  if you have already read all the previous books in the series, including the ones from the first series.  One of the few things I don't really like that much about this series, is that everyone  has to have someone else to &quot;like&quot;.  This gets incresingly annoying as the series goes on and the kids get older.  And lets face it, Raaba's only purpose of existance is so Lowie will not be left out of all this.  Zekk started out that way too, but luckily he now has his own placein the Star Wars world other than The Boy Jaina Likes, so I guess there is still hope.  One of  the good things is that it only goes as far as mild crushes and never all that boyfriend/girlfriend, breaking up and all that, so  that is good thing, especially for someone like me who is not very big on romance at all, especially imature teen romance which  seems to be so popular.	2001-01-05

Part of what makes this such a good series is that the same plots  are not recycled over and over again, and each book has it's own  particular dilemma to solve that all adds up to the intertwining plot of the whole series.  In this particular story, Jacen and Jaina go to the Alderaan system to get a small piece of the planet to give to their mother, Leia for her birthday.  As you can probably guess, things do not go as planned and they have several adventures along the way which I won't elaborate on for those of you who havn't read it yet.  One of the  good points of this book, and this whole series actually, is that the kids in them are so nice.  They are always polite and respectful and are never cruel and nasty to anyone.  And yet, the  authors accomplished this so flawlessly that it doesn't make them seem like goody-two-shoes either, since they can be bad sometimes too, it's just pleasant to read that kind of a book sometimes.  One of the major flaws in this book, which several people have already mentioned, is that the everyone forgets that it isn't just Leia's birthday, it's Luke's too.  I mean, the whole point of the story was that the twins get a present for their mother, and then, even in the ending birthday scene, everyone completely forgets about Luke, including Luke himself it would seem!  If what they celebrate is their adoption dates then they at least should have said something about that instead of just ignoring him.  I think that would kind of hurt his feelings.  Well, at least he got to come to the party.  Like I said, this is an excellent book in the series, if you ignore the flaws I just mentioned.	2001-01-03

First of all, just in case Amazon doesn't fix this wrong link, if anyone reads my other review here somewhere it's actually a review for Number 3 The Lost Ones, but THEY messed it up and put it here instead.  This however, is my real review for this book, Young Jedi Knights, Number 6, Jedi Under Siege.  In this book the  Young Jedi Knights rush back to Yavin 4 from their previous adventures on Kashyyyk to warn everyone of the impending attack from the Shadow academy.  When they get there, the Jedi think they have at least a few hours before the battle to prepare, but in fact the dark Jedi show up just a few moments later.  This whole book was basicly one long battle scene that involves just about everyone, original characters and new ones.  Also what I liked about it was that this book didn't just focus on the same group of characters (Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, Lowie, Zekk and if we're lucky Brakiss) like a lot of the other books did.  Instead everyone has their own moment of glory, and even the older characters get to have some book space.  Luke even got to have his own lightsaber battle which was of course the highlight of book, no, the series!  Even after all this time he is still the coolest Star Wars character ever and he finally gets the chance to prove it.  This book also has major conclusions to Zekk, the existence of the Shadow Academy, and the reserected emperor.  This book was probably the best written of all these, though as far as being my favorite it is tied with Lightsabers, which is number 4.	2000-12-31

Just as Lightsabers focused on Tenal Ka and The Lost Ones focused on Jacen and Jaina,  now it is Lowbacca's turn to shine.  Lowie has never been one of my favorite characters in the series, though that is just because I never bothered to pay much attention to him before, and this book did a wonderfull job of bringing him to the forefront, and I came to see that I really did like him a lot.  Anyway, Lowie's sister Sirrakuk is about to go on her wookie rite of passage, and Lowie is afraid she will go alone and get killed so he decides to go to Kashyyyk and go with her and he askes his friends to come with him to give him and his sister moral support  durring this diffucult time.  They do, but once they get there the shadow accademy chooses that precise moment to attack Kashyyyk  and capture some supplies from the wookie factory!  And the raiding party just happens to be led by Jaina and Jacen's former friend Zekk, who is now a dark jedi.  Will Lowie and Sirra survive the rite of of passage?  Is Zekk so hardened that he would kill his former friends for personal gain?  You'll just have to read the book to find out, though I would reccamend reading the previous four first other wise you will be totally lost.  The one downside of this book was that Luke was not in it very much at all, just one scene at the beggining to be exact.  Yeah, I know these books are about the next generation of  warriors, but that doesn't mean we have to exclude everyone cool  from the previous generation.  But those of you who, like me, missed Luke in this book can rejoice because he is in the next book quite a bit, and even gets his own lightsaber battle.	2000-12-29

Since then I have read it and the rest of the series many times over, and this book never loses it's flavor.  The discriptions and characters were so vivid that I could see everything that was happening, and it felt almost as if I was there.  Anyway, in this book, Luke decides Jacen, Jaina, Tenel Ka, and Lowie are now ready to build their lightsabers.  The story goes into great but not tedious details as to how lightsabers work, which is something I have always wondered about.  So anyway, Jacen, Jaina, and Lowie all build their lightsabers slowly and carefully like they are supposed to, but Tenel Ka rushes through hers so she can be the first one to finish, and then when she and Jacen spar, something terrible happens....      Part of why I loved this book in particular was that it had a lot of character development without compromising action, most especially in Tenel Ka who is the main focus of this story.  I greatly enjoyed this, because Tenel Ka is definitly my favorite character in the series, because she is so strong and tough and doesn't let anything stop her, not even a crippling accident, and of course because she is a warrior princess.  This book would be best if read after the previous three books in the series, though  it can be understood on it's own too.  The reading level of this  series is not very high, just high enough to be above the 9-12 age range.  Any Star Wars fan over the age of ten would probably like this book.	2000-12-26

It is written in journal form about what Luke was thinking and feeling during A New Hope, though this book spans a little before it too.  This was especially interesting for me, since Luke has always been my favorite character.  Part of why I loved it is that it was not simply yet another retelling of the original story, but breathed new life into it, and made it  even more interesting, and considering that I have seen this movie so many times I practicly have it memerized, that is quite a feat.  My one complaint of this book was that, though the character of Luke was explored deeply and in ways that few other books have, all the other characters were pretty much left out with the exception of Leia, since Luke was thinking quite a lot about her at this time.  But then again, when I write in my journal I usually don't focus on other people either, and since this is supposed to be Luke's journal, that does make sense.  In short, this was a wonderfull book that I would reccamend to any Star Wars fan, especially those who love Luke.	2000-12-23

In it, Saaski begins life as a happy elf child, untill the other elves discover that she is half human, and thus cannot perform many of the essential elf magic spells.  They then change  her for a human child and put her in it's place.  At first she is confused and angry, but gradually her memories begin to fade and she believes herself a human.  All her young life she has to deal with the cruel prejudices of the simple village folk, as she  also deals with confusion of her own strangeness.  Untill that fatefull time when she is eleven years old....  Any way, this was  an excellent book with some of the best writing and characterizations I have ever seen in a book, and I would reccamend it to anyone, but most especially, as the auther herself put it, To all children who have felt different.	2000-12-23

In it, the main character, Morwenna, accidently inherits the last five wishes left over from the creation of the world.  At first she is overjoyed, untill she realizes the rules: she can't wish for anything for herself, she can't tell anyone about the wishes,  and if she uses up all five wishes she'll die.  This gets especially complicated when she has to use up several of the  wishes to save her friends.  The ending came as a complete surprise, and I have to admit, it was more than a little disturbing.  Did Morwenna learn anything?  I guess that's for the  reader to decide.  I had expected something redeeming to happen and for everything to turn out all right for everyone but I was wrong.  It was sort of like well, what was the point of the story?

One of the good things about it was that it showed more of Han and Leia as parents, which is very interesting, and it gives the reader a better perspective on what kind of background Jacen and Jaina came from.  I also thought it was very sweet how Jacen and Jaina invited their friends home with them for their vacation, though I personally would rather have gone home to my own family.  :-)  Also I liked how Anakin was in this book more than he usually is, since he has always been my favorite of Han and Leia's three children, with Jaina as a close second, since she is a very strong female, reminiscent of both Han and Leia.  Zekk has never been one of my favorite characters, especially in this book, mostly because he didn't really seem neccesary, at least at first, just there so Jaina would have someone to like.  But, with  the excellent writing of this book, I found myself truly feeling  for him at certain parts, especially after the banquet, even though he is not the sort of character who usually appeals to me.  So, to sum it up this was a really great book, just not my personal favorite.	2000-12-23

This was a wonderful book that was in some ways even better than its towering prodeceser, if that were possible!

Magda however, is totally bored with chores and caring for sick people, and she longs to join her father and Robin Hood and his band of outlaws.  She gets her wish, and she goes with her father and the outlaws to save some girl, but faces more challenges than she was prepared for when she finds herself facing in battle the man who ruthlessly murdered her mother.  Part of why I liked this book was that it showed in true depth a father's love for his daughter, and that more of the action, in fact all of it, took place with the main character right in the thick of it, instead of just having it happen to other people &quot;offscreen&quot;.  This was a truly wonderfull book with beautiful writing and style and I would reccamend it to anyone who enjoys strong female heroes.	2000-12-20

The characterizations were awesome, most especially Marian, who was an incredibly cool character in this book, unlike most other Robin Hood stories, so characters get five stars.  The plot was good also, though I wish more of the action had actually taken place in the story.  Instead, all the outlaws would go out and fight a battle &quot;offscreen&quot;, and then come back and tell the other  characters about it, so plot gets three and 1/2 stars.  Writing style and dialogue were possitively breathtaking, with true old style flair, so it also gets five stars.  So, altogether this book wins a unanimous four stars, which is excellent.  This book would be best for kids ten to fifteen, as younger kids probably wouldn't get most of it.	2000-12-19

The story itself was compelling and often sad, though a bit slow moving at times, so I rate it four stars.  The writing was great also, in true fantasy style in very elequent fashion.  It gets five stars.  As for the characters, that's where it gets more complicated.  The main character, Sybel, is a young sorcerous who cares nothing for anyone or anything except the magical beasts she tends.  But she is forced to care when a young  man called Coren brings a baby (Tam) for her to raise.  She grows to love Tam and gets very attached to him so when Coren comes back for him some years later it just about breaks her heart.  In the beginning, I admired Sybel for her inner strength and cold nature, but as the story wore on, I began to like her less.  She seemed way to cold, way to mean, and she took advantage of people she loved, and allowed others to take advantage of her.  By the middle of the story I was thoughroly disgusted with her behavior and really didn't care one way or another what happed to her.  Coren was still a good character though, and he was the redeaming factor for the story, and for Sybel, ultimatly.  My only problem was that I thought Coren was much to good for Sybel, but I do admire him taking her on like that and straightening her out in the end.  So I suppose characters gets 3 and 3/4 stars.  So altogether this book gets a well deserved 4 stars.  This is definitely not a book for young children, though twelve is probably old enough to read it.	2000-12-19

I have also read a lot of Star Wars books and most of them have been great.  Finding a perfect combination between the two was awesome!  In this story, you are the best friend of Luke Skywalker, and the choices you make ultimately decide the fate of the galexy.  This book was very exiting with reasonably good writing and characterization.  The one problem I had was that I would rather have been Luke or Leia or someone other than this made up character who has no real place in the Star Wars universe. (Luke's best friend? Wasn't that  Biggs Darklighter who left Tatoinne months earlier to join the rebbelion and who got fried in the first Death Star battle saving  Luke?)  But, despite this I enjoyed it and intend to get the other two as soon as I can.	2000-12-18

The story is about Daystar, the son of Cimorene, and his quest to learn how to use his magic sword and free his father from his imprisonment.  Along the way he gains several companions, including Shiara, a fire witch, who echoes Cimorene in some ways, though is less clever and sure of herself, and has a disposition far worse, but is a likeable character none the less.  I also liked the character of Daystar, but I don't think he is nearly as cool as his mother, or his father for that matter.  This book has many conclusions that will be immensly satisfying to those readers who  have been following this series.  I won't say what they are though for the benefit of those haven't read it yet!  I would reccamend this highly well written and fun series to any fantasy lover, though kids 10 and up would probably like it best.	2000-12-18

Since I myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot (though I'll  admit he's not as bad as Dairine) I found myself truly resenting Dairine's character in the other books.  But, since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view, I began to dislike her less, and finally in the end I realized I identified with her quite a bit.  This book was definitely the best in the series, both in character development and in writing quality.  The Lone Power is such a cool foe!  Kind of like the dark side of the Force except it's more solid than that.  This book would be good for anyone who likes fantasy, and even those who don't might  change their minds reading this books like these.	2000-12-18

Actually, let me rephrase that.  The parts about Ireland were cool, but just about everything else in this book was not very good compared to the other books in the series.  Not that this book lacked exitement.  In it, Nita's parents send her to Ireland to be with her aunt, in order to seperate her and Kit so they aren't spending so much time together.  Once she gets there, she discovers that her aunt is also a wizard, and so is just about everyone else, including some irritating boy that Nina meets and likes.  The worst part is that whole kissing scene between her and that boy.  Not only was it totally gross, but also it disgusts me because Nita is way too young, and it's not like the relationship would last.  That may sound really  lame comeing from a fifteen year old, but lets face it, it's true!  This is an okay finish to the saga, but it isn't really neccacary if you don't want to have to put up with the flaws I mentioned.	2000-12-18

Though at the beginning I was somewhat disapointed that the book was from the point of view of Mendenbar, since I wanted it to be more about Cimorene, I quickly warmed up to him and enjoyed his character.  What happened at the end was no surprise to me, since I essentially knew they were meant for each other from page one.  Part of why I liked this book is that the characters actually go on adventures, whereas in the first book everyone just kind of wanders around and gets to know each other.  But don't get me wrong, the first book was good too, and in fact almost essential if you want to understand this one.  This would be a good book for anyone who likes fantasy stories, though some previous experiance with other fantasy stories would help to get some of the jokes.  Anyone could essentially read this series and enjoy it, though kids 10-15 would probably enjoy it best.	2000-12-17

Though it moved somewhat slow at times, it still had exciteing parts and ended in a huge cliffhanger.  Morwen's point of view was very interesting, especially since I had never really paid much attention to her beforehand.  I do wish though, that Cimorene had had a daughter instead of a son since that would have been vastly more interesting.  I would reccamend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy, though kids ten to fifteen would probably like it the best.	2000-12-17

Being an avid reader of fantasy, I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book was in a league all it's own.   The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on  how to be a wizard.  After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank.  In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and  be partner wizards.  As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified  strongly with the main character.  Though some of the magic spells they were doing got a little bit tedious, the book was generaly very exiting and well written with somewhat of a sad ending.	2000-12-17

The story is  about a bored princess named Cimorene who is absolutely sick of learning how to be a lady, so she decides to run away from home and have adventures. (The best move she ever made if you ask me)  After following the directions of a talking frog, she befriends and becomes the princess of the mighty dragon Kazul.  All in all this was a funny, lighthearted tale that makes fun of just about every fantasy story and fairy tale that has come out in the past five hundred years or so.  Though some of the jokes may be lost on readers not previosly well read in fantasy, it is still an excellant and well written book with lots of strong female characters.	2000-12-17

This book  had great discriptions and excelant character development, especially as Shimmer tries to reach a middle ground between Thorn and her new friend Indigo.  I wish however, that she had been more fair between them instead of favoring Indigo all the time.  I myself began to resent Indigo's existance!  Despite this, I truly did love this book and would reccamend this book to  any young reader who likes fantasy stories and mythology.	2000-12-15

The story is told from the point of veiw of Shimmer, an outcast dragon princess who has lost her home, her family, and everything she ever cared about.  At first she seems content to wander the world alone and search for a way to help her lost people, but then she meets Thorn, an orphan human boy, who is also somewhat of an outcast among his people.  At first they seem an unlikely match, but gradually they  begin to understand they are two of a kind and begin to build a strong caring companionship.  This book has excelent character development, and breathtaking discriptions, as well as realistic action scenes.  The writing is good and easy to comprehend.  I would reccamend this book to any fantasy fan, though people 10 to  15 would probably enjoy it best.	2000-12-14

The main character, Princess Quinnella (Quinn) is interesting and fun, even though I am generaly more a fan of the clever, weapons expert, sharp tounged, villian stomping &quot;Xena&quot; type heroin.  I also do not normaly enjoy love stories, though this was an exception.  The love story itself is predictable and boring, but the book itself was so well written that I would sit down to read it for five or ten minutes and &quot;wake up&quot; hours later  realizing I had forgotten everything else but the story.  I do wish however, that she hadn't fallen in love with Adam.  If she really had to fall in love with someone it should have been Cam.  Actually, I really don't think she should have fallen in love with anyone because it's not like the relationship would be real, she's way to young!  Also I found myself greatly annoyed by the way Quinn let herself by jostled and fought over by boys.  She should have choosed the one she liked (Adam) and not just gone along with whoever won the &quot;joust&quot;. Despite this it was a truly good, well written book and I greatly enjoyed it.	2000-12-14

I just finished this book last night, and I have to say it was definitely the best of the trilogy.  It was so good I just wanted to stay up all night and read it!  The writeing was great and very discriptive so that I could truly feel what the characters were feeling.  The characters themselves were very well developed, I thought, new and old ones alike.  I'll admit that I really didn't care much for Thrawn in the other two books, because he seemed like just a boring guy who sat in a chair and handed  out orders and looked smart.  It wasn't until this book that I began to realize the extent of his briliance and appreciate him as a villian and as a character.  I was actually sad when he died.  Mara was awesome right from the begining though.  She is definitely one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe.  I thought the solution to her problem was ingenous, and I loved the way her character developed over the course of this series, and how it turned out in the end.  This trilogy were definitly the best Star Wars books I have ever read,  and I would reccamend them to anyone, children and adults alike.	2000-12-11

First of all, they make Leia a weak female, not tough and strong like she usually is, and  they turn Luke into a total geek!  Han's character is hugely exaggerated, and Chewie might as well not even be there for all the parts he has.  The only characters who acted even a little bit like themselves are the droids.  The writing is not very good, and the plot is even worse.  Why would Han and Leia just take off like that in the middle of an alliance mission meanwhile their friends are wondering where they are or if they're dead or alive?  And Hollagram Fun World is just plain silly.  This is definity a series for younger kids.  I myself enjoyed it when I was younger, but now just about anything else would be better.	2000-12-10

Out of all the books in this not very good series, this was probably one of the worst.  Right behind Zorba the Hutt's Revenge  and Queen of the Empire of course.  As much as I enjoy it when the characters wander around jungle planets,(my favorite) this book had an unbelievable plot, weak diologue, and an extremely childish writing style.  And that Ken is a nice boy and all, but a complete geek.  An attempt to relate to the &quot;normal kid&quot; who would be reading this book.  Also the characters from the movies are either grossly exagerated, or practicly nonexistant.  All of them are warped and  and barely recognizabal as Star Wars characters, most of all Luke.  Kids twelve and under, for whom this book is intended for,  probably won't mind any of that, though, adult and teenage Star Wars fans, such as myself will probably find them boring and silly.	2000-12-10

The characterizations are a bit better, though not by much, and it seemed to have a touch more Star Wars feel than the others, which  hardly seemed to be Star Wars books they were so far from what the characters are supposed to be.  The plot was a little more believable too, though some parts of it were still very silly.  It had a higher sense of drama too, in that it actually HAD a sense of drama.

Now that I have recently read this book and the whole series again, I realize that they are really not very good at all, and I am generally pretty leniant with books of all kinds!  This book in particular was one of the worst.  The plot is silly and unbelievable, and the characters and writing are plain awfull.

This book had a bit of a darker feel to it, and thus felt more like Star Wars than the other books in the series.  However, this book may have been somewhat entertaining, but that  can not take away the fact that the writing is cheesy, the characters undeveloped and not like themselves, most especially Luke, and the intire plot is somewhat silly.  Kids too young or to lazy to read Young Jedi Knights, or Heir to the Empire, but would still like to see the Star Wars story continued would probably like this series.

For  me, even at age ten it didn't quite have the Star Wars feel, though I did find it interesting enough to want to read the  rest of the series.  Continuity though is important to me, and this book had none of it.  However I will say that this series would be good for kids too young to read say, Heir to the Empire,  but would still like to know what happened next.

For one thing, it's way to short! I can literaly read it in fifteen minutes, and all the best parts of the movie are left out.  The writing is also undiscriptive, boring, and it doesn't show the character developement that was in the movie.  Even when I first read this book at ten years old I thought it wasn't that good, but now truthfully the only interesting part is the pictures from the movie stuck in the middle.

I love the Melodies! The idea of a planet where kids rule is sooo cool! However, I don't think Luke should have let Anakin and Tahiri go on a dangerous trip like that with only Peckum to watch out for them, and even he is conveniently gotten rid of as soon as they land. Luke should have at least sent a Jedi with them. But then, part of why I love this book is because the kids are on their own protecting themselves, so what am I complaining about? One thing I wondered about was what ever happened to Sannah? She is never mentioned again in any other book, and I rather liked her character. I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan, but kids twelve and under would probably enjoy it best.

It was very exciting and moved quickly, and the  writing made the characters seem almost real, so that I truly felt for them.  All the original characters were cooler than ever and true to themselves, and all the new characters were awesome too, especially Mara Jade.  I like the way her character is turning out, in that she is a really strong, tough female, who  can take care of herself.  She still seems to hate Luke a lot, but even that is gradually fading.  I think it shows the strength  of Luke's character, in that no matter how much of a jerk she is to  him, he is always nothing but nice to her.  I would recommemd  this book to any Star Wars fan, and even to someone who's seen the movies and would kind of like to know what happened next.	2000-12-08

While I didn't find it as gripping and well written as some other children's Star Wars series I've read,it was still a very good book. The series itself is about Obi-Wan Kenobi when he was a young boy and how his training started. One thing that bothered me was their that if a kid wasn't chosen by a master by age thirteen they don't get to train.  Jedi potential is rare, why would they would just waste it like that? Shouldn't all the kids at the temple get a chance to train? If they didn't have jedi potential why would they be there in the first place? And why is 13 considered to old to begin training? Luke Skywalker didn't even start his training until he was 18+, and he still seemed to reach his full potential. Oh well, maybe I'm missing something. I also greatly enjoyed the character of Clat'Ha and Obi-Wan's arconan friend. This book also had great action scenes as well as well developed characters. I would recamend this book! to anyone who likes Star Wars, though children 12 and under would probobly enjoy it best.

This was the first adult Star Wars book I ever read, though I have read most of the kid ones (Junior Jedi Knights Young Jedi Knights etc.), and I absolutly LOVED it!  The original characters acted exactly as they should, and the new characters were awesome too without taking away from the older ones.  Thrawn was cool, and so was Pallaeon, but the coolest new character of all was Mara Jade, who is officially my new favorite character.  The best part of the whole book is the whole sequence when she and Luke are stuck in the forest and they have to depend on each other to survive.  One thing that bothered me though, is that I simply can't picture kind, caring, sensitive Luke simply walking out on Leia like that, though I do simpathize with his feelings of self doubt. The reading level of this book is fairly high, but I had no trouble tackling it.  Content wise, I'd say that just about anyone could probably read it, since nothing that bad happens in it.	2000-12-03

When I first read it two years ago it was the only introduction to the expanded universe I'd had, aside from Junior Jedi Knights and Young Jedi Kinghts, so many parts of it were very confusing.

I thought this was a good book, but not nearly as well written as the first trilogy.  One thing I liked about it was that it addressed Anakin's fear of turning to the dark side, though wasn't that taken care of in the previous book?  When I first read this, at age eleven, I really could have cared less about Uldir, and considered him an irritating fifth wheel.  But now that I myself am a teenager,(about to turn fifteen) I understand his problems better and sympathize more with his character.  This book is best for children twelve and under, but anyone could read it as long as they don't expect an epic. One more thing; how come in Heir to the Empire Yoda's house is all rotted and not even there anymore, but in this book, which takes place thirteen years later, it's perfectly intact.  Well, like I said, this book has it's flaws, but it's good.	2000-11-22

For one thing, I wish Uldir would stop being such a brat, can't he see Anakin and Tahiri only want to be his friends?  I guess not.  However, he does get better as time goes on, so that's a good thing. :) I also don't think that Mage Orloc is a worthy foe for Anakin and Tahiri.  Granted, this book is meant for younger children than myself, but even when I read it for the first time at age eleven I didn't find him very intimidating.  I mean, these kids have fought the dark lords of the Sith and come out alive, so in my opinion they shouldn't have any problems defeating this wimp.  But that's just my opinion.  All in all, it was a fun book and I would recamend it to any kid who loves Star Wars.	2000-11-22

The first Star Wars books I ever read were Junior Jedi Knights, which tell about Anakin, and after that it was very interesting to get to find out more about Jacen and Jaina who were barely mentioned in that series.  Jacen can be a little irritating sometimes, but he means well and I always liked him anyway.  Jaina is also a cool character, and I love how she fixes things.  I have to say though, that my favorite character is Tenel Ka because she is such a strong female, both phyisicaly and mentally.  Lowie is also a good character.  This book in particular was one of my favorites in the series, and I liked how Jacen and Jaina were nice to Qorl even though thier attempts to break through his brainwashing failed in the end.  I also greatly enjoyed the relationship between Jacen and Jaina.  Sure, they have their little squables sometimes, just like any other brother and sister, but they really do have a strong bond through the force and they really do care about each other.  I think anyone who likes Star Wars would enjoy this series, especially those between the ages of 10-15.	2000-11-22

I thought the characters were well  developed and the plot and story exelant, but I wish it had shown more of Luke's obvios inner development between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Instead it just had him act like he did in The Empire Strikes Back all the way through the book.  But despite that I really did love this book and intend to read the adults version as soon as I can.	2000-11-22

This is one of my favorites in the series,(it loses by the slightest margin to Lightsabers and Jedi Under Siege) because I love all the warrior women in it.  Tenal Ka is definitly my favorite character in the series and the sequences from her point  of veiw are my favorites.  Another thing I liked about this book  and the whole series actualy, was that the adults have a real part in story, instead of just being there for effect.  I thought  the writing was exelant, and the characters extremly well developed, and I would recamend this series to anyone, though kids ten to fifteen would probobly enjoy it best.	2000-11-22

The writing was good and discriptive, though it didn't grab me in quite the same way as the first trilogy did, or even as the two books before this one did.  To me, it seemed that this whole book was a rehash of the previus one.  It had practicly the same plot, except Uldir finally went just a little to far.  And they had to bring the Orloc guy back.  I don't think he is a very good villian, because he is too unsure of himself, and he doesn't even have any real powers.  His very presence insults the intelligence of the characters, and the fact that all of them are jedi, or at least jedi trainees except Uldir.  Like I said, the writing was good, and the characters well developed, even if the plot was less than perfect.  And despite it's flaws, I greatly enjoyed reading it, and intend to do so again.  Definitly best for children twelve and under.	2000-11-22

I first read this book and the rest of the series when I was ten or eleven, and I thought they were the best books I had ever read.  And since then I have rarely read a book that has captured me in quite the same way.  The writing was great, and very discriptive and the characters were well developed.  This book was also the first introduction I had to the expanded Star Wars universe, and I thought it explained very well about Anakin and Han and Leia and everyone without to many complicated explanations.  I've recently gone back and read these again, and while not quite as gripping as before, they're still great books, though best for children twelve and under.	2000-11-21
