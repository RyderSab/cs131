His new one is no diferent, a perfect psychological horror story that will give you the creeps. Julie Hutchinson's husband gets brutally murdered and from that point on, her life becomes one mysterious nightmare. After his body disappears from the police morgue, Julie starts to reveal secrets about her husband's past, which involved a top-secret government project: Daylight, where experiments on young children with ESP took place. With help from her mother, daughter, stepson, her husband's ex-wife and Michael Diamond, a TV psychic, Julie finds that things are not as they seem as she enters the world of reincarnation and psychic phenomena. Dark, disturbing, sad, full of passion rarely seen in horror novels, this is a great winner from a great author.  <br />	2005-06-15

The novel deals with Russia trying to restore the Romanov dynasty. The story follows Miles Lord, a black lawyer from Atlanta, who is representing a huge firm which is in charge of checking the so-called Romanov ancestors (to see whether they are real or fake). This new tsar means billions for certain individuals who mean to be the real powers-that-be in Russia and who want to use their choice of a tsar as a puppet. While accessing top-secret archives, Lord finds things meant to be buried - that two bodies were missing from the Tsar's executed family. He teams with a circus acrobat, Akilina Petrov, and they both try to discover the real truth. During so, he finds that Rasputin predicted all of this before his death and that both he and Akilina are meant to bring this prophecy to life. They both travel the country, then go back to the States and try to find the surviving members of the Romanov family - all the time eluding professional Russian mafia hitmen. How a lawyer and a circus acrobat escape all of this is ridiculous and stupid at times and the prophecy is pretty lame itself. Besides that, the book is fun and full of action with an interesting mystery to be solved.	2005-06-15

This is a superb novel about four friends in Princeton, two of which are trying to solve the world's most complex book: Hypnerotomachia Poliphili. The book is one huge mystery, but once solved it reveals a hiding place of the world's greatest treasures and the secret of why the church and some of the world's greatest minds struggled against each other. But it is also a story about true friendship and love as each of the four friends go through trials which make their friendship either stronger or being lost forever. The revelation is much better than Da Vinci Code, the characters are splendid, the writing excellent, and overall this is one of those books you will never forget.	2005-05-30

It is suppose to be a ghost story, but it just drags on being a mystery, an adventure, a drama and completely boring when we get to have the mystery being revealed to us. A story about a female journalist being drawn to Cambodia by a ghost of her father. Once there, along with a group of ghosts, she finds an ancient city which brings the dead back to life and does not allow for anyone to leave once they enter. The chapters are without any life in them and this is a failed attempt to make a Vietnam-war statement by using a haunting temple story.	2005-05-30

A secret canister lies hidden in the deep basement of the Pentagon - a canister from WWII, a genetic experiment by Germans to create a perfect killing beast (sort of like great white shark on legs). A repair work, after the 9/11 attack brings a crew to the basement and they set the beast free, which then starts to kill any human it comes in contact with. The big question is: why wasn't the canister ever inspected for 60 years? It just laid there in the basement of the Pentagon. Could have been much better, and what it is is average.	2005-04-24

It must be mentioned that, even though Lewis Perdue claims that Dan Brown stole his ideas, this book has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with Brown's much better novel. An order of monks wants to assassinate the Pope and take over Vatican while using Da Vinci's secret weapon of mass destruction, which is described in his notes.

House of Bones is excellent and it deals with four characters who are invited by a billioner to stay for two weeks in a housing project, ready to be demolished due to the evil and violent things which took place there in its past. All fours' lives have been shattered by horrible events in their past and here in Dreamland, the name of the projects, they will come face to face with their past and thus bring upon them ghosts and evil presence gathered in Dreamland.

It deals with H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard, who after writing to each other for a long time, finally meet in person. The reason for this is an ancient artifact, which comes into Lovecraft's possession - an artifact that holds the key in preventing the ancient god Cthulhu from entering our world and destroying it. They set out on a journey which leads them to meet with a hooker, who will play a vital role in their quest. They are followed by a black car with two mysterious men, who it seems are the servants of Cthulhu.

Dan Simmons is one the best authors out there, although his fame is lesser than that of many much poorer writers. Children of the Night is one of his best books. This dark tale takes place in majority throughout Romania and Simmons describes it superbly. Count Dracula is ready to die and has chosen an heir to take his place, in the form of an infant. This infant gets adopted by an American doctor, who takes him back. She also discovers that the child holds the key to curing AIDS and cancer, but at what price. The child gets kidnapped by Dracula's fiends and is brought back to Romania for a special ceremony, where the child will become initiated into the vampire life. The doctor with a help from a priest and a Romanian student tries to save her adopted child. The characters are riveting, the writing dark and superb (there is not one boring chapter here).

I cannot believe it is unknown and unheard of.  This is one of the best religious mystery-thrillers ever written. The characters are greatly described, the story-line is so well written, you simply read page after page, not wanting for each chapter to end. The story deals with the mystery of Christ's death on the cross and it's consequences for the next 2,000 years. I wish Paul Kent would have written other books. I read about 60 books annually and The Crib is one of the best out there, a trully hidden treasure.	2005-01-10

The writing itself is beyond criticism: no one talks or acts as stupidly as the characters in this book. This is a waste of time, a waste of a great idea, a waste of writing. 2 stars go only towards the concept, nothing else. This is a lousy author.	2004-12-31
