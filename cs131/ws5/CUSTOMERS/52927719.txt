With The Thief of Always, Clive Barker scores a bull's eye, and proves he does not have his imagination solely restricted to the violent eroticism which are largely predominant in his &quot;adult writings.&quot; Here, he writes what people classify as a &quot;children's book&quot;, but that could mislead and discourage many adults, which would be a shame, since this book is lovely. <br />As always, Barker brings forth examples of prodigal imagination at work, and using both words as well as illustrations done by himself- he brings this book to life. It is compulsively readable, and with its short chapters, you'll find yourself hurrying through it to find out what happens next. Clive Barker is doubtlessly one of the most important writers in our times, and this work is just further testament to his growing string of successes.	2001-05-09

I don't believe words alone can do justice to not only this novel, but the man responsible for its making. I read a Clive Barker interview several years ago where he says he loves working with big canvases- the bigger the canvas, the more possibilities there are to create, and create he does!<br />There is a big, sprawling canvas set out before you here when you read this book. The characters pull you in with them, making you feel what they feel, see what they see, hear what they hear.  The description of the other worlds, and the mysterious sea of Quiddity really hooked me. <br />Perhaps its most redeeming value is the fact that so many different strands of ideas are tossed in and jumbled up that you think he will screw up, you think there is no possible way of ending this, not without calling for a Deus Ex Machina- but he has an ace up his sleeve that he lets slide out at the perfect moment, bringing the First Book of the Art to a close.<br />What is very upsetting, though, is to know that Everville, the second book, is no longer in print. Which is why I am thankful I have found it through a used book dealer. The only other negative aspect of all this is to wait for the third installment to come out...and when it comes out, knowing that there won't be anymore of it.	2001-05-09

Dear readers of this review,<br />Just so you realize how cheated out I feel, I have not finished this book yet. I am hanging on by sheer determination (or stubbornness) to see if it gets any better, any more credible.<br />Reasons why I believe this book should not have been written:<br />-The Silence of the Lambs grabs you by the scruff of the neck and doesn't let go until you're finished. Hannibal Lecter is the genius, the mastermind, and to me- the central character in that novel.  -The confrontations between Clarice and Hannibal are devoured readily and eagerly and you want more.  -When Lecter orchestrates spectacularly his escape from the jail, I cheered him on. As he says in his letter to Clarice...&quot;the world is more interesting with you in it.&quot; I thought so too. Not much was known about Lecter's past, his background. Virtually nothing, actually. When he ran away at the end of &quot;Silence&quot; I felt oddly satisfied. It was the appropriate conclusion for the book.<br />Where Harris really goofed up for me, was in writing this book. An unnecessary sequel that devalues Hannibal Lecter. He's no longer the caged creature. The mind games are pretty much over.<br />Silence of the Lambs was a &quot;mess with your mind&quot; novel. Hannibal is a &quot;mess with your stomach&quot; novel, going for excessive gore and shock value to get its point across. In doing that, in my mind it makes a mockery of the character of Hannibal Lecter. <br />He has never looked so &quot;bad guy from the bad B movies&quot; like before! You can almost expect to hear him cackling shrilly after committing an evil deed. Like the character of Brad Pitt said to that of Kevin Spacey in &quot;Seven&quot;, and I quote:<br />&quot;You're a movie of the week! A T-shirt, at best!&quot;<br />I believe Lecter is heading for the same unwelcome status headed by the likes of Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger. These guys used to scare us in the past, as did Lecter. Now they're just comical.	2001-02-15

Weaveworld is Clive Barker's finest effort (at least from all the ones I've read, probably on part with The Hellbound Heart, if not better than it.) It is so compulsively readable, it hypnotizes you with it's beautiful passages.  Few writers can be as effective as Barker in opening a window to their mind and soul so you can peek inside, and revel in the devouring darkness of an imagination that runs amok shamelessly. This is a much darker and twisted version of Lewis Carrol, and one must read it with an open mind to fully appreciate the enormity of the canvas that is spread before your very eyes. Barker is a contemporary genius, a true wizard, a wordsmith of unparalleled talent. One of the most enthralling, engrossing books I've ever read. If you haven't read this yet, do yourself a favor and go get it.	2000-12-11

I gobbled it up happily in one sitting, because it was very quick to grab my attention, and once it was grabbed, it held me till the very end.  I don't need to and I won't tell the plot line of this story...read the blurb above.  Once again, Sheldon like the true magician he is, pulls the rabbit out of the hat in a way only he can, when you least expect it. Just when you think there couldn't be any more surprises, the story veers off into a new and unexpected direction. That's what makes Sidney Sheldon, Sidney Sheldon! Cute details that most readers will probably not have been aware.<br />1) The principal in Kemal's school, Vera Kostoff, is obviously a homage to Sheldon's wife Alexandra, (n√©e Kostoff) 2) The character of Anastasia Mann is Alexandra's sister in real life. 3) Rowana Trott I believe is his niece. (I must check on that) 4) Armand Deutsch worked alongside Sheldon when he was working for MGM.<br />I believe that's all there is. I think it's a cute way to pay tribute to people who influenced his life. <br />This wasn't a classic like Master of the Game (and a novel of that caliber I believe will be VERY hard to reach) but, nevertheless it was compulsively readable, and just to contradict the nay-sayers: &quot;Predictable? This is anything BUT predictable!&quot;<br />I now eagerly await for more! Will we see Dana, Jeff and Kemal again? Give us more, sir! Keep up the good work!!!	2000-12-08

Then again, once could see King was maturing, ever since works like \\"The Green Mile\\" onwards. From that book onwards, even from a few  books back, King showed himself less concerned with relying on gore and  scares, and portraying more character-driven plots, in more humane  situations. Granted, that \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\" seems to be a  King paying a visit to the old familiar grounds he had trodden on years  before. But that was it. This book is a homage to the 60's. While it works,  on one level, as this homage, this tribute, it is not something you would  associate with King having written. <br />King has been first and foremost a  horror writer, \\"America's literary boogeyman\\" as the Press  referred to him at one time. Sure, as he got older, he ventured into newer,  more mature directions, but there was always the element that made him  famous, present in his works. <br />Hearts in Atlantis, except the first story  (that incidentally is more than half the book's length) is a complete  departure from the style we all know King for. I am not too sure I liked  what I read. If King continues on this very same path maybe I'll think  twice (for the very first time in my life) before buying another book of  his. <br />I am terribly sorry, but this book just didn't cut it. Maybe  because I wasn't around in the 60's, this book didn't have the meaning it  should have, I guess. It just lacked in King's usual, traditional elements.  Sure, it had memorable characters, done in a way that only King  could...making you either care for them, or despise them. Then again, it  ended and did so leaving me dissatisfied. Several questions hung in the  air, unresolved. Was it King's intention to do so, or just sloppy  editing?<br />I am a writer, myself, and I pride myself in always tying up the  loose ends in my stories so my readers never stay wondering. I hope he'd do  the same...<br />Sorry Steve.	2000-08-31
US	52927719	R3DWI2V9ZM4LJ4	0553574604	120642208	Icon	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Reads like tomorrow's headlines.	Frederick Forsyth's &quot;Icon&quot; is a big, riveting novel. It's very very good, don't get me wrong. The premise is pretty frightening as it reads like a rebirth of Hitler's Nazi era. The plotting is intricate and  flows and unfolds very nicely along pretty much 90% of the novel, then the  ending seems quite rushed. It was a bit of a let-down because I believe he  could have stretched the novel at least 50, or 75 pages more, but he  decided to finish it all in a way that I particularly thought was somewhat  rushed. With that taken care of, I could say that although the premise of  the novel is pretty scary, it's also quite unbelievable. If a person who  intends to be a president like Igor Komarov has a hidden agenda of things  he REALLY wants to do when he comes to power, I don't believe he would be  stupid enough to actually sit down and write what is dubbed the &quot;Black  Manifesto.&quot; On that note, it's also pretty silly that a document of  such devastating importance and consequences is actually left on a desk to  be seen. Then, enters Leonid Zaitsev, the Rabbit, a close-to-illiterate  cleaner, who spots this document on the desk, and decides to open it and  nose around in it. He doesn't understand big words like  &quot;extermination&quot; and such, so what does Zaitsev decide to do? He  turns over this document to the authorities.  Once the improbability of  that happening is pretty much ignored, or just accepted- like I did- the  novel is very good and a particularly fast read, despite it's length.	2000-06-27

First and foremost, let me quote reviewer &quot;dan x&quot;: ...&quot;I did a little research and found that this book is the first in a series for fictional detective Alex Cross. (I hate to read a series out of order, even  if the stories are independent and don't continue from book to book.)&quot;  <br />I also did some research and came up with the same results as he did,  and I too, hate reading books out of sequence. It is indeed, a very fast  and engrossing read that has pretty much of everything in it. I will  doubtlessly look forward to reading future Alex Cross novels, there's no  doubt about that. If they are anywhere near as good as &quot;Along Came a  Spider&quot; was, then they're excellent.	2000-06-23

He keeps the prose going. I always said I don't entirely like the use of the first-person narrative, and going against me  is the fact that most of the stories in this book are presented in that  format. Well, I guess I had to agree with it. I read the whole book and  enjoyed it. I managed to &quot;ignore&quot; the first-person narrative...to  forget about it so I could simply enjoy myself with the book.<br />Although  these stories are by and large very good...at least a head and shoulders  above other anthologies of the like that I've had a chance to read, there's  yet another point I want to make here, and I know, this point doesn't  really encourage you, review reader to go out and get this book, I know,  but I feel like I should tell you.<br />For those who weren't familiar, before  reading this book, I should let you know now (even though Morrell will tell  you this in the book himself) that in the late 80s, he suffered the tragic  loss of his 15-year old son, Matthew, to bone cancer. (This story is told  in David Morrell's book, Fireflies, available here.) The grief of this  tragic loss is something that is present in virtually every story here. For  people who don't like to be constantly hammered over the head with that  theme, I guess this book isn't a good choice.<br />Now for why this book IS a  good choice, I guess I could simply say it contains one of the best short  stories I've ever read...&quot;The Typewriter&quot;. &quot;The  Partnership&quot;, &quot;But at my back I always hear&quot;, &quot;The  Storm&quot;, &quot;For these and all my Sins&quot;, &quot;Mumbo  Jumbo&quot;, &quot;Dead Image&quot; and &quot;Orange is for Anguish, Blue  is for Insanity&quot; It's quite a lot of stand-outs, but, yes, these are  my personal picks.

Mr. Schechter pens yet another true-crime story that is worthy of a reserved spot for any true-crime buff. As the late author Robert Bloch said: &quot;People are only into Ed Gein because they haven't heard of  Albert Fish.&quot; <br />So, here is Fish's book. It is unbelievable. One has  to remind oneself that this is actually TRUE. This really did happen. I  couldn't believe it. A person who indulged in a numerous variety of  perversities, sexual fetishes (some way, way too bizarre to mention here!)  the unspeakably ghastly aftermath of Grace Budd was reminiscent of the  Brothers Grimm fairy tale classic &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. In my  previous review of a Schechter novel I said had found myself sympathizing  (in a very awkward way) to Gein and actually saw a motive for his madness.   In Fish's case I could not sympathise with him whatsoever. He was possibly  the most deranged man to ever walk on Earth (in my opinion)...but contrary  to what others may think, he was aware of the fiendish nature of his  crimes. He planned Grace Budd's abduction with a cool cunning, and killed  her in the most outrageous way possible... This makes for possibly the  sickest yet most compelling read in the genre ever.<br />Hats off to Mr.  Schechter once more for providing impeccable research and a story with no  boring moments in it whatsoever.	2000-03-30

I've heard of Ed Gein off and on for many years. I've heard his crimes were of an unspeakable, stomach-churning, monstrous nature. Yet again, I wanted to satisfy my somewhat morbid curiosity and see just how morbid his  crimes were. I was repelled. Psycho, The Silence of the Lambs, The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre...all of these films came to, thanks to Eddie and his  crimes. A cannibal, necro-sadist grave robber. Not even in fiction have I  seen a person crazier than Gein. Harold Schechter does a job that is, in a  word, brilliant. As awkward as it may seem, I sympathize with Gein. If his  early life hadn't been as it had, he most probably wouldn't have gone so  over the edge as he had done in his later life. <br />It is true to say his  crimes are inexcusable, but Schechter looks at it in such an angle that I  actually (believe it or not) saw a reason for Gein acting in the way he  did...as depraved, as sickly demented as it was. It is highly informative,  and written very well. There is not a single boring moment in it. It is  impeccably researched. And, believe it or not, it's a true story. This  actually happened.	2000-02-17

This is my first shot at reading a Connelly novel, and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised with it. I don't understand some people who criticize the book for ending the way it did, I thought everything was very  well thought out, finely honed and elegantly written. Writers are players,  and Connelly is a pro in this game from what I've seen. He had an ace  hidden up his sleeve, and threw it down at the precise moment. It's a book  full of great twists and turns and believable characters.  I think it is  unfair to compare this to Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs because  each book is unique in its own special way. I do think that The Poet would  look quite well on screen if it were to be adapted. Kudos to Michael  Connelly on a superb job, a crowning achievement to a great storyteller.	2000-02-10

I wasn't disappointed, not one bit. I might make a little correction as to that and say that the Talamasca document section was big enough to be read as a  separate volume entirely. It is on the whole, superbly well and elegantly  written, and, of course, extremely detailed. One important feature that is  missing from it, sadly, is a genealogical tree. The characters are pretty  much a truckful, and it can get a bit confusing if you're not focused on it  very much. I haven't finished it yet, but I am convinced I will buy the  other two remaining books in this trilogy. Very nice going, Mrs. Rice. Keep  at it!!	1999-10-20

Here's a note to all those who detracted this book in their damaging reviews: Find something else to do with your lives, if you don't like what an author writes, then don't read it, simple as that. <br />Now, as to my  opinion of this book. I am an avid Sheldon fan, I've read all of his books  at least twice (or in the case of &quot;Master of the Game&quot; many more  times than that)because I simply adored the way in which they were written.  This book is no different. It is excellent! Although it's a short book, it  still makes for a whopping good read with that ever-so-famous wham-bang  finale Mr. Sheldon is famous for. The reviewers can speak their opinions  sincerely, whether they like this book or not. Yet do not go as far as  insulting this man. As his fan, I am upset to see that so many reviewers  can be utterly heartless and insensitive. Mr. Sheldon who celebrated his  82nd birthday this year, still shows he's at the top of his form with this  book, and he only leaves me- as well as 285 million other reviewers-  thirsty for more.	1999-07-16

The human side of the characters is here- the ability McMurtry has of creating characters readers care about, is  here. This book differs from the others in the fact that it is much more  heavily accented with a brutal, dramatic tone. Yet that does not suggest  this book should be tossed aside as trivial trash that glorifies in graphic  violence and blood and guts flying everywhere.  Violent people like Joey  Garza, Wesley John Hardin and Mox Mox exist unfortunately, and their  creation in these pages is simply McMurtry's attempt to recreate the  brutality of that kind of life. The graphic violence is what adds the color  to the book, I would say, and it proves indispensable to make this a book  as good as I herald it. Yet... I finished it, and I did so with a feeling  of &quot;is that it?&quot; The future of certain characters was left still  to be decided. Does that mean a fifth book in the series is in the making,  perhaps? It would certainly be nice if such an idea was considered, maybe  it wouldn't do McMurtry any harm if he sat back and thought about that for  a while. Summing up, these four books really were pretty much very  interesting and I'd recommend them to anyone who isn't intimidated by  lengthy novels.	1999-06-08

To be utterly truthful, there were times in which this book lagged, somewhat, and I wouldn't be surprised, what with it being the size it is. Yet, all in  all, the reader is in for a treat when reading this book. It is the third  in a series of four novels, and it is indispensable reading, really for  those accompanying the Texas Rangers' adventures. It's not my favorite in  the series, though- the condition of favorite goes to &quot;Comanche  Moon&quot;- but I can't really say that until I have read &quot;Streets of  Laredo&quot; which is the one I am reading now. Just wanted to say thank  you once again. I haven't had this much fun with a saga ever since I read  John Jakes' eight-volume Masterpiece of the Kent Family Chronicles.

Readers who would only  read this book on its own would lose out the magic of McMurtry's style in  the first volume, &quot;Dead Man's Walk&quot;. Reading it from the start,  way back in the early days of Gus and Call, that sense of wonder is  present, you want to find out how their lives go on, what dangers they run  into and so on. This book is a further testament to McMurtry's genius. Us  readers thank him for creating such believable characters in this  terrifying, funny, tragic, wonderful saga.	1999-05-23

McMurtry is an obviously talented storyteller due to his ability to transport the reader into the world of Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae. Great characters, sharp witty dialog in  the Clara Forsythe scenes (ya gotta love her!) and pretty much stunning,  shocking scenes of very descriptive, graphic violence in the torturing  scenes. I think I will get through these four books with no problem. I'm  reading the second installment in this series(which would be &quot;Comanche  Moon&quot;- not in the order they were written, but according to the ages  of Gus and Woodrow) and I am finding it very hard to put down, too. It's a  pity these books are rather bulky. Once I finish them I will wish I hadn't  done so...that's the only bad part I can see so far. Other than that,  congratulations Mr McMurtry. I speak on behalf of my father and I when I  say that!	1999-05-19

The Green Mile is a novel to redeem King of the sour criticisms he has been target for in his recent novels. It's vintage King, but still very much unlike him, in that it's a hauntingly human novel, and it successfully  reaches in and touches the reader's heart. The trademark bloodletting is  down substantially with relation to his previous works too, but in no way  does that alter the fact this is a brilliant piece of fiction. Brilliant  because everything in it has a meaning. The violence is there and it's  violence with meaning. The world is a raw, brutal place, and to be confined  in a state penitentiary is just as horrific if not more. King successfully  portrays that with this novel. It stands out for these reasons above, and  so many others, but that I leave to the fellow reviewers to depict in their  own way. I will just close by saying the words of Mel Brooks: It's good to  be the King.	1999-04-08

Yet after that, the book suffered, because it took on a route extremely  similar to The Devil's Advocate. It's as if Mr. Neiderman really enjoyed  his previous work to the point of making it heavily influence this one. If  it hadn't been for the heavy &quot;Advocate&quot; shadow on this book, it  would have got a much higher rating than it did. It nevertheless is an  effective page turner.	1999-04-07

The first 200 hundred pages of the book hooked me but then what began as an interesting premise ran out of gas as it became too much of a weird science-fiction  story. It seems like Mr Little got too engrossed in wanting to finish the  book that he piled event upon event and made it look rather messy and  nonsenical towards the end. The first part of the book focused on a true  all-too credible everyday horror...it could happen to me, to you, to  anyone. We could be simply &quot;Ignored&quot; as he puts it. The second  part was as if influenced heavily by film director David Lynch. Good  imagery, but far too surrealistic and far-fetched...thus blowing what could  have been a very good book all around. If Little's books all follow the  same kind of style then perhaps I won't read another one of his. It will  take me a lot of a goading and persuading if I really must.	1999-03-27

I watched &quot;Hellraiser&quot; (the film this novella ended up being) several years ago, and I vividly remember the hideous graphic quality of the violence described on film. In the book, it's just as graphic if not  more. Barker dabbles in hellacious imagery, torture, eroticism. It's a very  short book but shockingly effective in its purpose of leaving the reader  disturbed throughout the story's development, but at the same time anxious  to see what will happen. For fans of horror written with style, this is the  kind of book that needs to be on their bookshelf.	1999-03-25

This is the second Stevens novel I read (the first being The Anvil Chorus) and both of them go in absolutely different paths. &quot;Anvil&quot; is written in a suspense-thriller type way much in the tradition of the  contemporary greats of that genre, whereas &quot;Insanity&quot; goes on a  completely different path. It has hooked me. I haven't finished it yet but  as far as I have read it, I can already put it down and recommend it, just  like Stephen King said, to &quot;readers who have strong stomachs&quot;.  Thomas Bishop, the killer in this book, is like a fictionalized version of  Jeffrey Dahmer, the Wisconsin Cannibal. Yet we must be reminded of the  following...this book was published in the 70's...Dahmer only became  notorious much later. If anything, I think Stevens based himself on  &quot;Headhunter&quot; Ed Kemper to create Thomas Bishop. Kemper's crimes  were horrific brutal and senseless, and he had murdered his parents  (although Bishop only murdered his mother)Perhaps I am wrong in my  assumptions as to who Thomas Bishop was based on. But one thing I am not  wrong about is the fact that this is to be considered a masterpiece in  gruesome and graphic horror, and a must read.	1999-03-05

This was Mr. Forsyth's debut novel, and it couldn't have made a better impression so much as on the readers as on the critics. There was not one boring instant whatsoever and the suspense hung on throughout all of it's  almost 500 pages. Now, to keep suspense going at such a length is already a  major achievement. To do so right on his very first novel, is an even  greater achievement. Mr. Forsyth showed himself as being a player who  played his game really well, leaving the last hundred pages of his novel  packed tight with tension, and the very last chapter with a slam-bang  finale.

After a long time I managed to finally get a hold of this book, and I am both happy and sorry that I did so. Because, as soon as I started reading it, I was hooked and  couldn't let the book down. Mr. McCammon made me damn uneasy with the  reading of &quot;Mine&quot; (it was the second ever book to actually made  me consider stopping it for fear it was going to scare the heck out of me-  the first was Stephen King's &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;)and he repeats his  success at scaring me with &quot;Blue World&quot;. The novella is the only  one I have not read as of yet, but I can say that of the stories which I  read, &quot;I Scream Man!&quot;, &quot;Makeup&quot; and &quot;Doom  City&quot; especially got me turning the pages faster than I could read  them. There is a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; aspect to some of them, and in  &quot;Makeup&quot; for instance I could already picture it as a &quot;Tales  of the Crypt&quot; episode. Needless to say, I LOVE both Twilight Zone and  Tales from the Crypt, and now have become an even greater fan of Mr.  McCammon than I was before, thanks to this collection, scheduled to be (if  not already) a classic in its genre. A note for Mr. McCammon: They can do  any kind of comparison they want with your work, sir...but you are unique  in your field. There is only one Robert R. McCammon out there, and he needs  to come back on scene quickly. Hats off and a standing ovation to this man,  author of classics such as the mind-numbing, stomach cramping  &quot;Mine&quot; and the undescribably fantastic &quot;Swan Song&quot;  alongside with seemingly everyone's favorite bedside companion, &quot;Boy's  Life&quot; which could very well be re-titled as  &quot;An engrossing  recollection of memoirs in the life of a 12-year old citizen of Zephyr,  Alabama&quot;   This is what storytelling in the grand tradition is about,  proving that there still are people who care enough to produce stories with  theprimary intention of entertaining, and not for the sake of a mere  contractual obligation.	1999-01-22

Since I've only read four books of his, counting this one, I can only compare it to two of the others of his which I have read. It's almost as good as The Chamber  (but not up there with it) but really third best, to both The Chamber and A  Time to Kill. The fourth one is The Pelican Brief which wasn't very much to  my liking, I must say. This book is pretty similar to The Chamber due to  two things. The tension builds up with each page, and...there's an ending  that doesn't quite end! (those who read it will know what I mean!) I don't  like to be made to wonder what happens, I like to be told.

Instead of  resuming each book individually, I thought I'd gather all books into one  single review and say that it has been perhaps the most entertaining time  of my life. There's everything and anything any reader could possibly want.  It's a massive compilation of historical detail gathered along with  wonderfully crafted fiction. Its an overly dramatic saga, rich in tragedy,  suspense, action, poignant love scenes. The person who reads these books  and says they're nothing short of excellent truly does not know what great  fiction storytelling is about. No wonder these books have received the  critical acclaim they have. They are definitely books that stand in a class  of their own.

Even though Stinger is pretty much a lengthier novel  than Usher's Passing,I read Stinger in less time for it seemed to be just  nonstop action all throughout its 530 pages.

I held on nonetheless and was glad that I did. A pretty much  satisfying conclusion to this story, which I once again emphasize- was not  close to his better works, but still close.

Not exactly his best novel but far from being a bad one either. A man who commits a murder in a moment of blind rage finds himself pursued by two bounty hunters who are very peculiar. One has a third arm and a head coming out of his chest and the other is the second coming of Elvis Presley. They pursue this man, Dan Lambert who is in his last years of life after getting leukemia from Agent Orange poisoning and who is paired up with a girl named Arden Halliday who would be a beauty were it not for the port-wine stain covering half her face. Arden goes on to pursue the &quot;Bright Girl&quot;, supposedly a faith healer who would remove the port wine stain from her. Dan ends up being in charge of Arden and both are pursued by the bounty hunters and the police. The bounty hunters, in turn, are pursued by drug dealers. Theres a lot of chasing going on all through the book and theres a heavy dramati! c accent to it as well.

I would give Mr. McCammon full justification for him to take as long as he does to write his novels. Every single one (of the three I read so far) are pearls. They are terrific books and widely different in style. Swan Song was an absolutely breathtaking and scary novel with an apocalyptic insight into the world after an atomic war. The Wolf's Hour was a brilliant espionage book about a Russian agent turned American who can voluntarily change himself into a werewolf and uncover a Nazi organization. Then, we have this one. Boy's Life. Such a moving story. As it is called, a &quot;fictography&quot;, and one that can only be considered as a work of brilliance by a gifted author. Once again, I say I am not way too fond of first-person narrative, but this book was so good, but so good, that I didn't mind once it was written in first person. This is obviously one of those books I will read and re-read again in years to come. A book to have and to treasure, and one to pass on ! to the coming generations. The magic oozes out of each page. The suspense factor in it too, about the body at the bottom of Saxon Lake, also builds up relentlessly, and when you think there's nothing more to it, something else pops in. It's the work of a sheer genius. Mr McCammon doesnt need to fear competition. A work like this has no competition. I am glad I have become acquainted with the works of this man from Birmingham, Alabama. He sure is a wonderful author to read. I can not wait to read his next book, whenever it may come out. Well done, Mr. McCammon. This, I say on behalf of all of those who, like me, once were 12 and had a chance to revisit those days.	1998-07-22

However, it contains the elements which have become trademarks in the Koontz novels... much like in Watchers, there is a dog and there is a laboratory. But as always, even if the plot tends to be predictable, Koontz manages to turn things round unexpectedly. Truly gifted in his ability to write, I am happy to see that in future I, as will his other fans, will meet once again the likes of Christopher, Bobby and Sasha.

Ray Bradbury too, writes with an uncanny understanding of human nature and he has the ability to make the reader be a part of the story, too. I will just mention a few of the stories here which, in my view further complimented the reasons why Ray Bradbury is what he is today. &quot;The Foghorn&quot;, &quot;Here there be Tygers&quot;, &quot;A sound of thunder&quot;,&quot;The murderer&quot;... these show fear, direct confrontations with man against beasts he would never have encountered before, as well as man with his own internal beasts, the very ones which destroy his inner self.

I felt disappointed the book had to end. Not the way it did, because it all tied in neatly into a big and tidy climax with precise timing. There will be certain scenes here I am sure will prevail in my memory for a long time due to their effective descriptions. At times it ventured into the horror and suspense so successfully it made me feel uneasy. Certainly a recommendation for the fans of well written epics of horror. For that is what this is.

An author accustomed to being under a center spotlight like Stephen King would usually have one day, his dream of writing a long novel of apocalyptic scope. He realized this dream when he produced The Stand. All throughout it must be said the book is a masterpiece of darkness. However, nothing is flawless. How about the several hundred pages of ad hoc committees written in the diary of Frannie Goldsmith? That is plain boring, in my opinion. Not relevant in the leastest to the story. Not wishing to be unkind or anything, but then, how about the ending? Talk about far-fetched!! Deus ex Machina to the rescue! Gee!! That damaged the book's reputation. If that hadn't happened, the book would no doubt have to have been awarded AT LEAST a Bram Stoker award. Mr. King, do us a favor. Write a good novel, but write it all the way through. Dont just let it all go at the end. Your millions of readers thank you.	1998-05-17

I may be a bit harsh in saying this, but I felt awkward before I started reading this book. A man who can voluntarily change into a werewolf? What a silly premise for a plot, I thought. Then, I started reading the book. The blurb doesn't justify McCammon sufficiently. Its a wonderful book. Pretty in its love scenes, raw and brutal and graphic in its violence...but theres always a fine balance to it. I will look forward to reading more from this author in the future, and I sure wish he gets more of a recognition for his work as time goes by. He deserves all the praise he gets, thats for sure.	1998-05-08

It is nowhere near the GOOD stuff Grisham writes. Everyone must have his/her ups and downs..perfectly understandable. With this book, I think Grisham was having a bad hair day... Nowhere near &quot;The Chamber&quot;!	1998-04-03

My very first and up to now only novel read by Noah Gordon does indeed tell me I have to read more of his. Now I know that the Rob J. trilogy is complete, I know at least I have two other books I MUST read. Highly recommended.	1998-03-02

Mr. Koontz seems to like plots about scientific experiments going wrong in labs...I could go on and mention a series of books of his which deal with this. However, this review concerns this book only. And a good book, it is. I enjoyed it immensely as I have done with all of his other books (I have 32 in total, a few missing) The lab aspect isn't the only one we have seen before, either. There is also the grief-struck mother who lost a child, and who also happens to have a gun, and falls in love with a guy who just so happens to have I AM THE HERO OF THE PLOT scrawled all over his forehead...these things are the trademark Koontzian predictables. However, there is always a different kind of twist to them, plus the very elegant and appreciative style of writing he uses to captivate the readers. All this ties in to make yet another success added to the bibliography of this great author, who stands in a class of his own.	1998-02-05

Aside from Dean Koontz, I think that Stephen King may be forced to abdicate his throne to the likes of Dan Simmons. I have read &quot;Carrion Comfort&quot; due to an indication of a friend of mine, and I was amazed. Not only by its bulkiness, but also by the fact that in it being so big, 900 pages, give or take, it was not boring, in the least. A new frontier has been forged in the fields of horror. It's name is Dan Simmons.	1998-01-28

I find it outrageous that just because this book's main character is a gay man, immediately people jump to to the assumptions that Mr. Barker himself is gay- well, so what if he is? It does not alter the fact that he is still a good writer. Sacrament, unlike his other two novels I read, (Weaveworld and The Damnation Game) is a far more credible tale, and more enjoyable. I was hoping that Sacrament would redeem Barker of his flop with The Damnation Game, and it did. A pat on the back of this Liverpudlian!	1998-01-25

Two very good novellas and 12 stories which are completely different from each other. Commendation to the author is a must, but also redundant. There are two stories here which still do a perfect job of poking me uncomfortably in the subconscious. Those would be &quot;Down in the Darkness&quot;, a perfectly written gem, and &quot;Kittens&quot;, one of the most disturbing short stories I ever read in a long, long time. It still goes on to prove there are some writers out there who manage to convey more terror in 8-10 pages than others who take up a whole Bible's worth and do nothing which remains in the memory of the reader. Koontz has not only achieved this with this collection, but with all the other books of his which I have read. Koontz is the one man who manages to write the gruesome horror of contemporary novels with the elegant, nearly poetic lyricism of past days. Well done, Mr. Koontz!	1998-01-21
