I think the publisher let the author down on this one - some serious editing work was called for and apparently not executed.  For the money (almost $100.00), the reader deserves something better prepared than this.	2005-10-03

It was erudite, witty, and very, very originally observant of human behavior and motivation.  I recognized myself throughout, sometimes painfully so and sometimes amusingly so.  I especially enjoyed the skewering of academic fakery, surely the most profoundly comical of all forms.  A great read.	2005-06-04

This book succeeded admirably on both counts.  It deals well with the history of Korea beginning in the pre-WWII era and continuing up to the present, and provides as detailed and fascinating an examination of Kim Il-jung and Kim Jong-il as one could ever imagine reading in something written by an outsider.  I enjoyed it immensely and feel like I now have a far better understanding of the forces at work in that very strange and dangerous little nation.	2005-05-15

In general, I thought it was pretty well done, certainly through the first three quarters of the book.  Though not a light, enjoyable read by any means, it kept me turning the pages. <br /> <br />Unfortunately the end of the book seeems to come unraveled.  It's like the book, and by implication the author, have become so emotionally overwrought that they are now no longer able to convey a coherent story.  Much of what happens in the final 50-60 pages, including the appearance of what I considered to be gratuitous christian-bashing (like all christians are going to be perfectly content to sit by while America's Jews are put to the slaughter - please!), simply made no sense in light of what came before.  In the end, I found that the considerable promise of this book was not fulfilled.	2005-02-19

It's hard not to enjoy reading this book, it's very well written and deals with a vastly underappreciated yet remarkable man - John Adams.  My chief complaint is that one gets the impression that the author considers Adams to have been a human being unburdened with any sort of weakness or flaw.  This greatly diminished my enjoyment of the book as I couldn't help but feel that I was reading a biography with a decided spin to it, as opposed to a dispassionate analysis.  It often reads like the sort of bio that might have been written by Adams' campaign manager if he were alive today.  I also found the extreme negative treatment of Benjamin Franklin to be very odd.  McCullough presents him as a rather useless, eccentric old fart who just sort of hung around, getting in the way of true heroes like John Adams.  Since this is obviously a decidedly minority viewpoint it would have been interesting to have a bit more of a rationale for why the author found it necessary to go after Frankline the way he did.  I found it odd, and it just added to my sense that McCullough was not able to rise above some evident preconceived notions about his subject matter.  A more balanced treatment would have been better.	2002-05-23

This is an interesting book, and I strongly agree with Picard's assertion that computers ought to be able to &quot;recognize&quot; and respond to human emotions.  She does an excellent job of making and supporting this point.  The other part of her thesis, that computers themselves should have &quot;emotions&quot; is much less clear.  She never seemed to adequately make the case that a computer with its own emotions would be of any significant value for anything, and frankly I can't think of any useful applications for such an ability.  Some sort of emotional component may be needed to fully support and achieve AI (and she makes this point) but in terms of sort of the standard user interface types of applications it's hard to imagine how such a capability could be useful.<br />Anyway, good book on a very interesting topic.	2002-05-16

The author talks a lot about how computers have moved from &quot;modernist calculation&quot; to &quot;postmodernist simulation.&quot;  Why there is a need to attach the modernist-postmodernist modifiers to calculation and simulation is never explained, and I suspect it is just done to give the book a tres chic intellectual veneer.  As with nearly all authors who use the term, the author does not define &quot;postmodernism&quot; or explain what it has to do with anything in her book.  Also a lot of vague talk about how &quot;people didn't used to like to do&quot; such and so a thing with computers but now &quot;people like to do&quot; such and so something other thing with computers a lot more.  No data of course, that would offend the postmodernists reading the book.  An important - VERY important - topic treated in a shabby manner.	2002-04-17

Gray's book is not nearly as objectionable in this regard as others (note, especially, the works of Pierre Levy, for truly awe-inspiring levels of incomprehensibiliy).  At times he hits on topics that struck me as having a lot of merit (he takes the editors of WIRED to task, for instance, for promoting a sort of hipster-oh-man-this-is-so-awesome approach to technology, and he appropriately skewers libertarianism, etc.).  However, I saw two main problems with the book: (1) The author appears to see everything and everybody in the world today as a cyborg of some sort - for example, ultrasound renders the fetus in the womb a cyborg, etc.  The concept is so widely applied that it ceases to have meaning.  (2) The regrettable lapses into postmodernist drivel, while thankfully infrequent are still discouraging.  There is also a little (not a lot) of political correctness a la feminist theory to deal with.  For instance, he spends some time skewering (no pun intended) the development of penile implants (cyborg penises!), and points out that the existence of such a phenomena validates the male-centric nature of technology so insightfully criticized by feminist theory.  Odd, but no mention of breast implants is made.  Purely an oversight, I'm sure!<br />There are so many serious topics to deal with in the area of our current and future relation to technology - when will someone write a coherent book addressing them??  While this book is an occasionally enjoyable read, in the end it can't be taken all that seriously.	2002-03-31

Terms like &quot;deterritorialization&quot; and &quot;rhizomatic processes&quot; infest the text to the point where you feel like you're reading some strange dialect of the English language.  It's maddening.  (2) The author presents a charming but hopelessly naive utopian view of an emerging social world, centered around the sharing of knowledge within cyberspace, that will usher in a marvelous new era of individually-centered democracy and freedom - the notion of &quot;collective intelligence.&quot;  One wonders if Levy has actually spent any time at all communing with the people who populate the chatrooms and message boards of cyberspace - &quot;collective intelligence&quot; indeed, more like &quot;collective prejudice and stupidity.&quot;  It is completely beyond me how others have found this book to be of any value whatsoever.	2002-02-16

O'Hara was a brilliant poet who seemingly had nothing to write about.  His language is incredibly imaginative, and his productivity was astounding.  But in the end the vast majority of his poems were little more than frivolous ditties about his friends and the artsy scene around New York City.  It's almost a shame that with his amazing talents O'Hara didn't live in a somewhat more challenging set of circumstances - it would have been interesting to hear what he had to say.  But reading his poems is like reading the work of an incredibly gifted, yet ultimately vacuous, artist.	2001-12-17

The stories themselves are told in a very compelling and entertaining style - each and everyone was not only insightful and &quot;meaningful&quot; in a moral and ethical sense - but a lot of fun to read as well.

The skill with which Matthiessen weaves his story is simply astonishing - the sense of place that one gets (the swamplands of early 20th Century southwest Florida) and the depth and realism of the characters themselves are incredible.

First, I found myself repeatedly cringing as the principles of buddhism were described as tools to get lots of money rolling into one's life. On that level, this book struck me as just one of many &quot;ancient secrets of the (buddha, bible, torah, koran, etc) can make you rich!&quot; type books. Inevitably conflicts arise between the demands of business and religious principles which, in some cases, the author either glossed over or ignored altogether, as if he almost didn't see the contradiction. For instance, early on he describes how his diamond business ran some sort of telephone or electric wire between two buildings, something that he cheerfully acknowledged was illegal. I don't know if we were supposed to find this cute or creative or what, but for me it raised a number of issues about one's committment to buddhist precepts versus one's committment to making a profit. Is it ok for anyone to break the law in order to promote their profits? Which laws are ok to break? How about all those pesky govt. environmental regulations - can those be overlooked too? The point is, I can think of lots of people (people who own oil tankers, run coal mines, etc.) who think of lots of laws as being trivial, annoying, unimportant, etc. What are they supposed to take away from a lesson like this? Obey the law if you feel like it?  I don't think this is a trivial point - I think it gets right at the heart of how one can be a truly committed buddhist in the world of business.<br />The other level on which I found this book to be somewhat disconcerting involved the more cognitive types of discussions. The author spends a great deal of time talking about &quot;imprints&quot; on the mind, karmic impressions derived from one's actions and behaviors.  I certainly acknowledge the importance and ubiquity of karma, and strongly believe that one's experience and much of what happens to one in life is a direct result of one'sown past actions.  However, I don't agree with the author's contention that these imprints actually determine the nature of one's reality as in &quot;behaving honestly will make those around you honest.&quot;  While I think it is likely that such behavior will promote greater honesty in one's closest colleagues and daily partners, I doubt it would have much of any impact on other, more infrequent acquaintances in the business world.  <br />This author is obviously a highly trained and knowledgable buddhist.  He is also obviously a successful business person.  However, I think this book misses the mark and makes it all seem somehow very easy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with working hard to make a profit for one's business, and of course there is certainly nothing wrong with being a buddhist.  However, these two &quot;practices&quot; will lead to occasional conflicts - the example of breaking the odd little law discussed above being one.	2001-06-25

It reads kind of like Harushi (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle) Murakami throughout most of it - very interesting examination of Japanese society, believable characters with real, every day kinds of issues and problems, etc.  But the end had one major disappointment, that being that the reader is left wondering what in the world becomes of one of the key characters in the book.  It doesn't really impact the &quot;mystery&quot; aspect of the story, it's just that it left me with a lack of a sense of closure about this one central character.

The photographs blend in well with the text, and the two combine to give quite a good sense of the places and the people encountered.  My only complaint was that the narrative seemed a bit rushed at time, almost as if the author had a quota of hermits to hook up with in a certain number of days - so no time to hang around.  I think an in depth examination of the lives of 2 or 3 hermits might be another approach that could possibly yield more depth, as opposed to the greater breadth of this book.  <br />Anyway - a very enjoyable read.  I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in religion, China, Buddhism, or Taoism.	2001-05-11

But on the other hand, this is a delightfully long and incredibly well-written book and the occasional sense of exaggeration didn't bother me one bit in the long run.

I found the premise of the story to be pretty fascinating, and I still do - I just wish it had been told by a more skillful writer.  The characters in this book are so two-dimensional and simplistically depicted that they almost come across like puppets or stick figures.  To me they all came across as caricatures and &quot;types&quot;, and I was completely unable to identify or empathize with any of them.  The plot is ok, but the absence of flesh and blood characters was too much for me to overcome.

However, I just want to add my opinion to those who have praised the humanity, intelligence, and usefulness of this book.  Having studied Buddhism for quite a few years, I can attest that the author's use of ideas from this domain reflects years of solid training on her part.  This is not new age, feel-good fluff, not by any stretch of the imagination.  It is an imaginative - and in my mind, brilliant - combination of buddhist thought and more recent parallel ideas from cognitive therapy, neuropsychology, etc.  I think it had just the right blend of theoretical, explanatory power (so you really get the sense that there's some there, there) and ideas for practical application.<br />This is a book that can add great value to anyone's life.

I just wish he hadn't done so in such a needlessly wordy and meandering fashion.  This book could easily have been limited to the length of an essay and conveyed the same ideas.  My biggest gripe, however, is the painful, self-consciously hip way in which the book is written.  The author seems to really want to be perceived as extremely cool, and this annoying tendency adds a lot of unnecessary fluff to the book.  Word of advice - when you see something on a book jacket that reads (as this one does) &quot;In this hip, erudite manifesto....&quot; just put the book back on the rack, back slowly away, and get the hell out of there.	2001-03-16

This is an excellent retrospective of his work over the years - work that remains quite consistent in style and quality across the decades.  I was especially moved by the poems that dealt with the death of his father, and the long poem about Vietnam.  The latter was written at the height of that war, and really brought back the sense of intense anger and emotion that gripped the country in those days.

Generally speaking I felt it was a very good story and was very well told.  The main characters are well drawn and have a level of complexity (i.e., the Chinese soldiers are not monolithically and uniformly evil) that made them seem quite realistic. Although the plot did seem to meander at times, I didn't mind all that much as the pauses tended to focus on some interesting aspect of Tibetan culture.  <br />As far as the criticisms I've read concerning how the book depicts Tibetan Buddhism, all I can say is that there are many, many varieties of Tibetan Buddhism - some of which are extremely esoteric derivatives of standard Buddhist doctrine.  So it may not be as far off as some think.<br />The thing I appreciated the most about this book is that it tells a story that focuses the reader's attention on the illegal and brutal Chinese occupation of Tibet and subsequent destruction of much of Tibetan culture.  The entire plot takes place against this appalling backdrop, which unfortunately is not fictional.  If this book helps to heighten readers' awareness of the Chinese government's ongoing atrocities against the Tibetan people, then it will have served a purpose far greater than simply having told a good story.	2000-10-04

The premise of the Bodhisattva Path or Life is to attain enlightenment in order to serve and ultimately &quot;save&quot; others.  As applied to everday life, it means living in as conscious and compassionate a way as possible - a life that concentrates on service to and awareness of other's needs.<br />While perhaps only a few can attain such an ideal state, one of the Dalia Lama's main points is that all of us can at least aspire to it.  And regardless of one's feelings about this particular path, there is plenty of value in this book for those curious enough to look into it.  <br />It's hard to pick up any book by the Dalai Lama and not take away something of great value from it, and this book is no different.  However, in my opinion this book may be slightly less accessible to the non-Buddhist than some of his more recent books.  This book sticks pretty close to doctrinaire Buddhism, and does not go to the lengths that some of the other books do in broadening the message for those of other faiths/practices.  The concentration on reincarnation may strke most Western minds as exotic or peculiar, and might perhaps disguise the underlieing message.

The premise of the Bodhisattva Path or Life is to attain enlightenment in order to serve and ultimately &quot;save&quot; others.  As applied to everday life, it means living in as conscious and compassionate a way as possible - a life that concentrates on service to and awareness of other's needs.<br />While perhaps only a few can attain such an ideal state, one of the Dalia Lama's main points is that all of us can at least aspire to it.  And regardless of one's feelings about this particular path, there is plenty of value in this book for those curious enough to look into it.  <br />It's hard to pick up any book by the Dalai Lama and not take away something of great value from it, and this book is no different.  However, in my opinion this book may be slightly less accessible to the non-Buddhist than some of his more recent books.  This book sticks pretty close to doctrinaire Buddhism, and does not go to the lengths that some of the other books do in broadening the message for those of other faiths/practices.  The concentration on reincarnation may strke most Western minds as exotic or peculiar, and might perhaps disguise the underlieing message.  I would recommend Ethics for the Next Century or perhaps The Good Heart for those not very familiar with Buddhism. <br />For those with a reasonable grounding and comfort with Buddhist thought, this is an excellent book.	2000-09-20

The story centers around his obsession  with the English Division 1 football team Arsenal, but you don't have to  like or care about the sport to really enjoy this book.  If you happen to  be somewhat on the fanatical side of devotion to a particular team in any  sport, you'll see a lot here that will ring very true.  My own  life-and-death sports devotion is tied to another sport (American college  football) and another team (Ohio State), but I was nodding my head in  recognition of my own feelings and behavior many times through this book.   As in High Fidelity, Hornby really captures the essence of this experience  and expresses it in a way that is precise, revealing and humorous.  Hornby  may be a novelist, but he's a very good psychologist too. <br />So if you are  a fanatic devotee of a sports team (doesn't matter what team or what sport)  or you'd like to understand someone who is - then read this book.  Highly  recommended!	2000-09-04

The book focuses on two  nascent projects headed up by the author and the &quot;Long Now  Foundation&quot; - the effort to build a 10,000 year clock and a 10,000  year library.  This projects are intended to help shift humanity's concept  of &quot;now&quot; to a much longer time frame.  And with this shift in the  concept of now, it is hoped that a new concept of responsibility for our  individual and group behavior will emerge.  <br />This book and the thinking  behind it represent an excellent counterpoint to the prevalent and  destructive view of &quot;now&quot; as beeing some extremely short term  time frame - today, this week, or (for many corporations) this quarter.   One can only hope that it is widely read.  If the ideas behind this book  and its associated project change only a small segment of our population's  view about stewardship and care for the long-term health and longevity of  our planet and our race it will be well worth the effort.<br />While I thought  the book was generally very well-written, and presented many, many  thought-provoking points, some of the ideas seem to have been rather poorly  thought out and gave the impression of having been simply tossed in to the  mix.  At one point a potential role of the 10,000 year library as a  repository of both sides of important debates is described - an excellent  idea, but the objective is described as allowing future generations to know  who to &quot;blame&quot; if things go wrong.  Going to all this trouble  just so our descendants can engage in blaming someone for something seems  rather silly.  Fortunately, there are loftier goals for this project, and  many are very well described throughout the book.<br />This book has strongly  impacted the way I think about the future. I highly recommend it.	2000-09-03

I consider The Wind Up Bird  Chronicle be a masterpiece, and others (e.g., Dance Dance Dance) to be  closer to mediocre.  I found this one to be in the same league as Wind Up  Bird Chronicle, but its also a far simpler and more direct, elegant story.   The translation is excellent, and the story itself is compelling and, in  places, heartbreaking.  Murakami really understands the male soul and knows  how to weave interesting stories around its travails.  This is a great, if  somewhat short read.	2000-08-21

A short read, it nevertheless  manages to convey a very compelling and disturbing story of life in  medieval Japan.  The story is essentially an illustration of karma at work,  but divulging any more than that would give away too much of the story.  It  reminded me a great deal of The Plague by Albert Camus - both books use  similar plot devices to make similar points about human nature, morality,  and the tenuous nature of human existence. <br />Yoshimura does an excellent  job of conveying a strong sense of place, personality, and a continuously  mounting tension that keeps you turning the pages.  A great read.	2000-08-10

He might well have said that there are those who  &quot;get&quot; poetry, and those who don't.  I have always been firmly in  the latter camp, but perhaps am more recently moving toward the former.   Though I still have quite a ways to go, this book really helped move me  along.  This is a very well-written introduction to the joys of reading  poetry.  Besides presenting the reader with examples of many different  types and styles of poetry it's just very enjoyable to read this author's  writing.  <br />While my reaction to the poems in the book is not even on the  same scale as the author's very visceral, emotional responses, I feel like  I nevertheless grasped enough of his reaction to know what he was feeling,  and what he was getting at in his description.  But I'll admit that some of  the poems I read over and over again trying to detect some of *his*  response in *me*, and I rarely did.  I think this has more to do with my  naivete, and I sort of envied the author's obvious depth of feeling in  response to these poems.<br />Anyway - it's a great read and if you're a lover  of poetry or even just curious about it, I recommend this book highly.	2000-08-08

This one had me laughing throughout, and for that reason alone it is well worth the read.  And no, I don't think you'd have to be a  guy to enjoy this one.<br />Keillor's writing, besides being very funny, is  very literate and clever.  Many of the stories come across in much the same  way his radio skits and monologues do.  But - I wouldn't say that he's  quite mastered the written short story genre just yet. Quite a few of the  stories have endings that read like Keillor just decided that the story had  gone on long enough, so let's see if we can wrap it up in the next 20 words  or so.  They kind of leave you hanging.<br />However, stylistic demerits  aside, this is one very funny book!	2000-08-01

I'll admit that I was really puzzled by this book when I started reading it.  Very little happens.  There is not much of a plot, at least as we usually think of it.  I found myself wondering things like &quot;what is he  writing about&quot; and &quot;where is he going with all this detailed  description?&quot;  The title aside, the book itself seemed like an enigma.   <br />But after a while I began to get almost hypnotized by the narrative.   And two things in particular really captured my attention.  First, the very  precise and painstaking psychological (and even behavioral) analysis of the  characters in the book.  To a great extent it reminded me of the level of  detail that Dostoyevsky would go to in his psychological examinations of  his characters.  Second, the almost zen-like mindfulness of his description  of setting.  I was really astonished by the scope of the writer's  attention, and his skill at simply noticing and describing ordinary things  in a really extraordinary way.<br />So - no &quot;action&quot;, not much plot,  excruciatingly dull if you're looking for a thrill-a-minute page turner.   However, if you can let yourself sort of mimic the mindset of the author  and just go with it a bit, I think you'll find this to be a pretty amazing  book.	2000-08-01

The author clearly knows how to  handle the short story genre (although the &quot;novella&quot; piece at the  end of the book was my personal favorite - great development of characters  in this particular piece!), and his experiences living in Russia have  obviously influenced the way his stories ring true.<br />If you like short  stories, and you're interested in the sociology/psychology of life in the  Soviet Union/Russia, you'll really like this collection.

The scholarship is very hard-nosed and the subject matter may sometimes seem a bit daunting, particularly in the sections dealing with the nitty-gritty of nervous system structure and  function.  But the attention required to absorb the information presented  in this book is well worth it.<br />I was reminded throughout of William James  Principles of Pscyhology, primarily because the author has concentrated on  relating the phenomenology of various states of consciousness to  contemporary knowledge derived from the neural, cognitive and behavioral  sciences.  Like the Principles of Psych, this book is encyclopedic and  astonishingly insightful in its treatment of a very broad and challenging  subject area.  As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation  for many years I  came away from reading this book with a whole new appreciation of the  relation between the activity of the nervous system and meditation.<br />One  issue with the book has been previously noted by other reviewers - many  readers might have difficulty in ignoring the nature of the animal  experimentation that serves as a primary data source for much of the  science described in this book.  This is one area whose many complex  ethical issues could have been much more satisfactorily addressed by the  author.  The skimpy treatment given this topic might, to some, reinforce  the incorrect notion that Zen is an amoral form of spiritual narcissism,  detached from real-world moral and ethical issues.  I sensed that the  author was well aware of the ethical issues at stake here, I just wish he  had addressed them more forthrightly.<br />Nevertheless, this book is simply  amazing in its breadth and depth of scientific and phenomenological  inquiry.  Anyone with a serious interest in Zen, the mind, or contemporary  neuroscience should read it.	2000-06-20

The author does a wonderful job of telling  the bleak and often heartbreaking stories of the early homesteaders of the  Montana badlands.  He traces the history of some of these families to the  present day and even &quot;follows&quot; some of those who pulled up stakes  and moved further west.  Throughout the book one continuously senses the  overwhelming influence of the vast &quot;great American desert&quot; and  how it shaped the lives of the people who tried to make a living farming it  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.<br />My only complaint is that a  particular 20-30 page section of the book makes extensive reference to  photographs which sound as if they would have added a great deal to the  reader's experience of the book.  Unfortunately, the author is describing  HIS experience of looking at the photos - none are included anywhwere in  the book - and I found myself wishing I could take a look at them  too.<br />The last rather minor complaint aside, I considered this to be an  excellent book, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.	2000-06-13

This one looked fairly promising at first, but quickly turned into a sort of lame romantic comedy centering around two English instructors (who  exhange positions for a semester - one in the UK and one in the States) and  their respective wives.  It has it's amusing moments and the writing is  good, but in the end it seems to have gone nowhere...

While I am not qualified to comment on its historical  scholarship, it certainly seemed very solid to me - the author's  documentation is thorough and impressive and his treatment is painstaking  and precise.  It certainly rings true.<br />However, my sense was that the  book started off as an excellent read and then began to drag somewhere  after the first 200 pages.  While I have no doubt that the latter half of  the book is as accurate and important a history as the first half, it  seemed to make for less compelling reading.  The first third or so of the  book concentrated primarily on the societal impact of the Japanese  surrender and its immediate aftermath - and I found it absolutely  fascinating.  The latter portions of the book dealt more with political  issues, including a very thorough treatment of how the occupying forces  (i.e. the US under MacArthur) drafted and pushed through the new Japanese  Constitution.  Very interesting, but in my opinion not as compelling as the  early material in the book.<br />In summary, if you are interested in the  history of Japan and/or World War II this book has to be on your reading  list.  A very impressive piece of work.	2000-04-26

Actually, when you get right down to it there is probably nothing more  practical, and even mundane, then Zen approached as an everyday  way-to-live-your-life practice.  This excellent book provides a series of  short essays on the topic of Zen and real life problems of living in  American society.  Nothing particularly weird or startling about it - just  some thought provoking guidance on incorporating buddhist practice in  everyday life.  Charlotte Beck's books (Everyday Zen and Nothing Special)  are similar - both are excellent and concentrate on Zen as a guide to  living a fulfilling and useful everyday life.  Highly recommended.	2000-03-28

It's like a cross between Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Kosinski's The Painted Bird with one crucial distinction - it's not  fiction.  <br />The surreal and tragic effect of this book builds relentlessly  as it goes along.  By the end, I felt like I had a sense of a place that  went well beyond a familiarity with appearance, to a much more important   (and difficult for an author to convey) sense of what it feels like.  The  unspeakable tragedy of this land - centered around the hideous legacy of  the Stalinist years - is conveyed in a thorough, convincing and compelling  way.  You cannot read this book and remain untouched by it - it is powerful  stuff.<br />A unique feature is the author's language and style, which is  often very poetic.  The juxtaposition of the fine writing with the often  macabre and disturbing subject matter makes for a strong effect.  <br />I  haven't read any other books by this author, but I will before long.  This  is an excellent, and highly memorable piece of work.  Highly recommended.	2000-03-13

And his calm, clear, level-headed mode  of presentation is SUCH a contrast to current screeds on the topic,  particularly those coming from the politically motivated far right wing  people who have hijacked the term &quot;christian&quot; - as well as from  the equally intellectually-challenged  atheistic groups.<br />Right-wingers  have done severe damage to  Christianity in the United States over the last  20 years or so.  As a result of their overtly political behavior they have  alienated and driven away many, many people who might otherwise have been  attracted to the teachings of Jesus.  Many people would probably never  dream of picking up a book entitled &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; as a  result.  However, I encourage anyone with an interest in spirituality,  ethics, and/or religion to read this book - it will give you a good picture  of what &quot;Real Christianity&quot; is all about.	2000-03-02

The concept and practice of compassion is presented as the foundation of ethics, and there is a great deal of discussion of how to  implement a compassionate (and therefore ethical) lifestyle.  However, this  book should be very carefully read because there is a lot more to it than  that. <br />It is easy, given the Dalai Lama's easy, conversational style of  writing, to miss some very, very important concepts.  Nearly every page of  this book offers a startling insight - but you have to take your time, slow  down, and notice what is being said.  It is well worth the time.<br />One  critical point is raised in the book that I wish had been explored in  greater detail.  The Dalai Lama expresses the opinion that the dominant  culture of &quot;unlimited economic growth&quot; is a serious problem for  all of us, both on a personal and societal level.  Unfortunately, the  unlimited economic growth model is something that is rarely, if ever,  questioned today.   Companies make money, and so do their shareholders, by  growing - by selling more cars, more oil, more land, more whatever than  they did last quarter.  If they don't, the stock price goes down and heads  roll. The problems with this economic model are so obvious in terms of the  damage it inflicts on the planet and us as its inhabitants - yet we seem  unable to even recognize it as a problem.<br />This book deals with serious  problems.  It forces us to look at our assumptions and behaviors as  individuals and as a society.  Yet it does so in a way that is ultimately  hopeful - the Dalai Lama is apparently a born optimist.  And I would feel a  lot more optimistic myself if only there was more than one of him.	2000-02-20

It's extraordinarily simple, both in its prose and in the story it tells.  But something about it drew me in and kept me  reading - maybe it was the sense that I was observing something about  Chinese society that I'd never seen before, maybe it was the story itself.   But I couldn't help but keep reading and was glad I did.  This story  captures the complexity of human relationships with a sort of Zen  simplicity that takes deceptive skill - skill that is all too easy to miss  perhaps.<br />This is a very well written book.  A very well thought out  examination of human emotions.  I recommend it highly.	2000-02-03

Frankly, I don't think it is, and the whole issue of whether or not it conforms to some accepted or  proper format or &quot;way-to-write-poetry&quot; seems terribly unimportant  to me.  Substance means a lot more to me than style, and whether or not  something speaks to me matters a lot more than then form in which it's  said.  So, questions of proper form aside, I'd just like to say that the  writing in this book accomplished what I *think* poetry is supposed to do -  it reached something deep inside me and spoke to it. I loved this book.	2000-01-20

There are many problems with it, and after a while I just couldn't take it any more.  First, Ellis repeats himself over, and over,  and over again - there are a number of key points in the book and they get  beaten to death.  Second, the book (at least the first 100 pages) is  remarkably content-free in terms of actual guidance on how to implement any  of the author's ideas in real life.  Third, it reads as if it was dictated  into a handheld recorder - it could have benefited from some editing.   Fourth, the author's ego intrudes throughout (how many authors have you  read lately who have their own eponymous \\"institutes\\"?) and one  tires of it very quickly.  Fifth, and most importantly, many of the ideas  expressed in the book turn out to be little more than word games and were  annoyingly stupid.  For instance, a lot of space (a LOT of space) is  devoted to a painstaking and, in the end, ridiculous analysis of the events  in life that we ought to (in order to promote a long-term \\"happy\\"  frame of mind ) think about as being merely \\"bad\\" or perhaps  occasionally \\"very bad\\" rather than maladaptively labeling them  as \\"awful\\" or \\"terrible.\\"  For instance, if my wife  should suddenly die I will only make myself all the more miserable by  labeling it as \\"awful\\" or \\"terrible\\" - instead, I will  be better of in the long run if I can think of it in less traumatic terms  (i.e., as merely \\"very bad\\") because after all it could have been  my wife AND children who died.  I don't know about you, but that doesn't  make me feel a lot better and amounts to nothing more than semantic BS in  my mind.  He actually gives the following example (paraphrasing):  \\"Even if you're being slowly tortured to death, it's still not awful  and terrible because you COULD be tortured to death even slower!\\"  The  author's thesis is that \\"literally nothing\\" is awful and  terrible, and if we think it is well then we're justgoing to be  unhappy.    I know there's got to be more to this guy and his approach than  the silly ideas and examples presented in this poorly written book.  This  having been the first book of his I've read, I can't say.  I got to the  \\"slow torture\\" part and tossed the book in the trash.      A good  book in this area - one that is very carefully and well written with a lot  of application to real life - that I can recommend highly is \\"The  Feeling Good Handbook\\" by David Burns.  Cognitive therapy looks to be  a good approach, certainly far better than psychoanalytic approaches.  And  I know that Ellis is one of the founders of this approach - but this book  is awful.	2000-01-15

Clearly, there's a lot of denial going on here,  amply demonstrated by the adolescent name-calling.<br />This book paints a  vivid picture of what's in store for much of this nation if we continue to  ignore the obvious. We've got to begin to do a better job of balancing  economic and ecological concerns.  The history of LA is characterized by  practically unchecked growth and an almost exclusive concern with not  impeding the ability of developers, real estate magnates, builders, and  other business people to make as much money as possible.  There's nothing  wrong with people making money, but there has to be balance!<br />I think it's  too late for LA and other areas of CA like Silicon Valley - the  &quot;quality of life&quot; there is abominable. But it's not too late for  the rest of the country.  Will we wake up?  Or will we just call people  like Davis names and go on doing what we've been doing for centuries, no  matter what the cost to our children and grandchildren.	1999-12-21

As far as I'm concerned, he is far and away the finest and wisest human being alive. So not giving this book the full &quot;five star treatment&quot; feels strange  to me.  So here's why I only gave it four...<br />This is a very good book  that centers around issues involved in christian-buddhist dialogue. I don't  think it's as good a treatment as Robert Aitken's The Ground We Share - but  it's very good nonetheless.  However, it could have been SO much better if  it had instead addressed the gospels from the point of view of what they  mean in light of buddhist approaches to leading a good life, rather than  what they mean with respect to more theoretical views on buddhist  cosmology, questions of christian-buddhist doctrinal similarities and  differences, etc.  <br />Most of the Dalai Lama's books are very, very good in  terms of relating buddhism to real life.  Reading the Dalai Lama in this  regard is in every respect a religious experience as well as a useful  experience in learning to live a good life. However, over all I found The  Good Heart to e a rather dry - though certainly scholarly - treatment of  how buddhism and christianity compare and contrast with one another.   <br />So, if you're interested in buddhist-christian dialogue on doctrinal  matters, this would be a very good book for you.  However, if you're  looking for something more along the lines of what the Gospels really MEAN  in terms of developing and nurturing a &quot;good heart&quot; - this is not  it.	1999-12-16

Check out Don Norman's Psychology of Everday Things for a more general, and more original treatment.  The topic of user-centered design has been floating around in the area of human factors  psychology for years, with many successful applications.  Simply put, there  isn't much new in this book.<br />And the assertion that engineers lie at the  root of the problem is naive.  The true problem in devising usable systems  that are also commercially viable and are delivered on time and within  budget lies in a team approach, with users, developers, engineers,  marketers, - ALL STAKEHOLDERS - involved in the process.	1999-09-28

It has been more than a month since I finished reading it and I still reflect on it from time to time.  The author has done an excellent  job with a difficult and important theme - the relation between God and  humanity.	1999-06-04
