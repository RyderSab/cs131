James B. Stewart delineates the machinations that typified the Clinton story throughout Bill Clinton's Arkansas governorship.  Now a lot of this is intertwined with the peculiarities of Arkansas society, where it seems everybody knows everybody else (no offense to many decent Arkansans; much of my family hails from there).  And this may be why Kenneth Starr was not able to find solid evidence of wrongdoing, although he obtained several convictions of Clinton associates.  Yet to many of us Whitewater was a real-estate deal a sitting state Attorney General and later Governor would not touch with a ten- or even a twenty-foot pole.  And that goes double for Castle Grande, cattle futures and Madison Guaranty Trust.  Under other circumstances an office holder would have put his or her assets into a blind trust.  This intrigue has continued into Bill Clinton's Presidency and beyond (White House coffees, stayovers in the Lincoln Bedroom, selling of sensitive technological information for campaign contributions, selling of pardons, the sneaking of antiques out of the White House, the financing of the Chappaqua house purchase and Hillary Rodham Clinton's registry with several department stores in the manner of an expectant bride--note that for her actual wedding in 1975, she bought her wedding dress off the rack at Dillard's the day before).  And those are just the FINANCIAL intrigues!	2005-07-02

However, it still holds interest for current readers because many of its subjects are still with us, even if only in their legends, descendants, bequests or business empires they started.  Here are, among others, Howard Hughes (the aviator, industrialist and filmmaker whose life was portrayed in the film THE AVIATOR), J. Paul Getty (the oilman and art collector who also founded an outstanding museum in the Los Angeles area), Ray Kroc (who first franchised McDonald's restaurants and saved the San Diego Padres from moving to Washington, D. C.--the Montreal Expos would make that move this year), Conrad Hilton (founder of the hotel chain that bears his name, and Paris Hilton's great-grandfather), William Lear (builder of the Lear Jet who also put a radio in every automobile), and W. Clement Stone (insurance and beauty-products tycoon and confidant of Presidents).  One individual described here who is still alive is Jeno Paulucci, who broadened America's tastes in prepared foods beyond meat-and-potatoes with his Chun King (Chinese) and Jeno's (Italian) brands.   <br /> <br />If a similar volume were produced today I would nominate as possible subjects Bill Gates (Microsoft), his close friend Warren Buffett (stock investments), the Walton family (WalMart stores), Steve Jobs (Apple Computers), Donald Trump (marquee real estate and TV reality shows), Steve Wynn (Las Vegas hotels and casinos), George Steinbrenner (shipbuilding and the Yankees), Merv Griffin (television production and resorts), and Oprah Winfrey (television and film production and publishing).

I currently live in Riverside and have met the author of this book.  He has made these selections from an eclectic collection of photographs and postcards which he has assembled over the years.  One distinct quality about Riverside is the fact that even today, with all the growth and development it has experienced, the essential character that it has had for over a century still shines through.  Even today you can enjoy the Mission Inn (where one President and First Lady were married and another President and First Lady spent their honeymoon), marvel at the tall palm trees or gaze at historic buildings, many of which are featured in this book.  The Parent Navel Orange tree still exists and still bears fruit.    And even with development and commercialism, Magnolia and Victoria Avenues still retain their grandeur and charm.  Among more recent developments, the University of California campus is the most beautiful college campus I have ever visited.	2005-06-19

Ann Coulter, who has gone on to a successful career as am author and political pundit, utilizes her legal and intellectual background quite cleverly in tracing the history of the impeachment process as it was first conceived, even referencing THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.  She astutely compares the proceedings against Bill Clinton with the proceedings against former President Richard Nixon--and I was in graduate school at the time of Watergate, so I remember that matter quite clearly--and notes that Bill Clinton and his Administration were guilty of much, much worse \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" than Richard Nixon was even accused of.  I personally think of impeachment as I would of a tourniquet to heal a wound, clearly a last resort--our elected officials serve for fixed terms of office and can be voted out of office or replaced through term limits of various sorts, such as the Twenty-Second Amendment--but the case against Clinton is certainly more compelling than that against Nixon or against President Andrew Johnson, who was impeached on dubious Constitutional grounds in 1868 but fell short of conviction by one Senate vote.  (For probably the most incisive descriptions of Watergate and the Nixon impeachment procedings [Mr. Nixon resigned before the House of Representatives voted on three articles of impeachment, after the release of the so-called \\"smoking-gun\\" White House tapes], see Len Colodny's SILENT COUP and Victor Lasky's IT DIDN'T START WITH WATERGATE.)  The only good, as I see it, coming from the aftermath and Bill Clinton's acquital by the Senate, is the fact that Al Gore was not elevated to the Presidency and did not have the built-in advantage of Presidential incumbency, and so (regardless of what you think about the aftermath of the 2000 Presidential election) did not occupy the Oval Office on September 11, 2001.	2005-05-05

Three famous sports venues opened that year.  Besides the Los Angeles Coliseum, Rasadena's Rose Bowl and Yankee Stadium in New York also opened.  While many books have been published about The House That Ruth Built and what took place there, this book fills a void.  And even the stadium in the Bronx would be hard-pressed to match the variety of events that took place in LA's mammoth saucer (O. K., there were many more World Series, boxing matches, and masses conducted by TWO Popes).  But the Los Angeles Coliseum has hosted two NFL teams, two Super Bowls, both historic in their own way, two Olympics, Evel Kneivel, an acceptance speech from a President-to-be, record-breaking attendance figures for the Dodgers and The Reverend Billy Graham, fireworks shows, rock concerts and one of the biggest rivalries in college football.  Concerning the latter, I remember the days when both USC and UCLA played their home games here.  And when they met in their annual clash, which often carried national championship and Rose Bowl implications, both teams wore their home jerseys (powder blue and gold for UCLA, cardinal and gold for USC).  A separate section of this book is devoted to the nearby Sports Arena, which hosted the Lakers during the era of Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.  Some excellent archival photos are included, including pics of the original construction and 1932 expansion (these inner and outer rings were separated during the 1994 Northridge earthquake).    My main qualm about this book is the fact that I did not see any photos of the Mass that the late Pope John Paul II celebrated on his visit to California in 1987 (he also held Mass at Dodger Stadium).  This was the first visit ever by a Pontiff to the Western United States.	2005-04-11

I went to California State University, Fullerton in the early 1970's, and when a southern California resident thinks of Fullerton those thoughts usually turn to the academic and cultural opportunities there, as well as the celebrities, such as Kevin Costner and Gwen Stefani, who went to college there.  However, the history of this north Orange County city is very much tied to the citrus industry.  Many fortunes were made here, and leading figures in this industry made their impact on Fullerton, including in the architectural sense.  Freddy Fender of Stratocaster Guitar fame and industrialist Norton Simon (Hunt-Wesson Foods), who later founded the famous Pasadena art museum, also had an impact here.  And for all you baseball fans who note that sport's return to the nation's capital, legendary pitcher Walter Johnson (the \\"Big Train\\") of the old Washington Senators went to high school here.  If you tour Fullerton with this book in hand you can see that many of the old buildings and points of interest are still there.	2005-03-28

I can still picture him being interviewed on TV before a game, long before he was the one holding the microphone.  But what interested me about his book was not only his account of his college and NFL careers or his broadcasting years but also his tribute to the high school and community college football programs in California, which have produced a number of outstanding players, and his look back on the celebrity social scene in New York City in the 1950's, the end of the Stork Club/Walter Winchell/Toot Shoor's era, where figures from the sports, journalism, political, entertainment and even literary worlds met and interacted.  Another poignant moment was the meeting between Ronald Reagan and John Lennon in which the future President explained to the music legend the intricacies of football.  Ironically, both would be shot; one would live, the other would not.  And most of the country learned about John Lennon's murder while watching the December 8, 1980 Monday Night Football game.	2004-11-10

Along with the usual Broadway and Hollywood anecdotes,  George Burns describes his boyhood on New York City's Lower East Side in the early 1900's and his start in vaudeville, as well as his fateful teaming with Gracie Allen.

I even remember the old PCL Padres from the early 1960's and listened on the radio as the Padres won the 1984 National League pennant.  This book is a treasure trove of reminders for those who remember the past as well as a good introduction to younger fans.  And I will say this:  the Padres and Padre fans do try to keep alive the memories of times gone by, constantly reminding us that there was good baseball in San Diego (especially with Ted Williams) before the major leagues came to town.	2004-11-01

Even though the first flights of the Mercury program and the moon landings of the Apollo program received more press coverage and glory, this was a necessary step in American space exploration.  What we now take for granted, such as space walks, rendezvous and docking wth another vehicle, and long-duration flight, were pioneered in Gemini.  As you read this book, which was aimed primarily at young readers (I receivedv this book as a high-school graduation present and still have it!), it seems as if Gus Grissom is there sitting with you on your living room sofa.  He certainly lives on in our memories, as do his comrades-in-flight on Apollo I and the fourteen astronauts who lost their lives in the CHALLENGER and COLUMBIA disasters.  In addition to telling us a little about his own life and marriage, a revealing glimpse into the post-World War II era as one who would make his mark on the future experienced it, he introduces us to other important figures, most notably his Gemini 3 pilot, John Young, who went on to land on the moon and later fly the first space shuttle mission.	2004-10-28

Roger Showley and George Jezek have assembled an outstanding collection of San Diego photographs of the past and juxtaposed them with present-day photographs of the same places to give the reader an excellent idea of how this city, often touted as an up-and-coming city, did indeed have a very colorful past.  Many buildings that San Diegans are familiar with today, particularly in the historic Gaslamp Quarter, were in existence at the turn of the last century, long before anybody ever heard of the San Diego Zoo or the Navy began its presence here.

However, this is an excellent read and very revealing of the author's journey to her Olympic gold medal and world championship in the days when competitors' mothers still made their skating costumes.  The book does give a glimpse into the rivalries and jealousies that admittedly plague this beautiful sport.  One very terrifying experience recounted by Miss Hamill was brought to my mind years later when Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee by associates of rival figure skater Tonya Harding after completing a practice session for the Nationals (resulting in a field day for the media, both tabloid and mainstream), prior to her silver-medal finish in the Olympics.	2004-01-11

Much has changed in this country in the intervening thirty-odd years, but its message is one that, actually, the Republicans have been heeding more nationally.  That is why of the seven Presidents who have served since this book was written, only two were Democrats, and those two were both Southern governors and at least attempted to sound like moderates (one may have been a genuine moderate).

I purchased the paperback version of this best-seller when I was eleven years old and read it so much that it fell apart!  There have been more recent and certainly more revealing books written by and about the original seven American astronauts and those they worked with, both in and out of the space program.  Yet this book, written at the time of the Mercury orbital flights, takes you right inside the Mercury capsule (yes, it was a capsule then) and makes you feel as if you were riding in space with the Astronauts, or training alongside them, whether it be in a simulator in their training headquarters, in a classroom learning cutting-edge (then) astrophysics, in a survival course on the desert or in the jungle, or on a trip to a meeting with the contractors who built the hardware for the space program.  Each astronaut reveals his motivation for joining the space program and his idea of how to go about his assignments; this alone disproves the notion that these men were all white male military test-pilot \\"peas in a pod\\".  It's as if they were guests in your living room.  With all due respect to Tom Wolfe, this is where you find the real \\"right stuff!\\"	2003-12-13

I am a southern California native and can attest to the fact that there are nice &quot;getaway&quot; places just a few hours, at the most, from Los Angeles or San Diego.  I myself have visited most of these towns and have fond memories of them.  Mr. Vokac includes much pertinent information relating to climate, points of interest, restaurants and lodgings.  He even tackles the subject of permanent residency in these towns, as a service to those contemplating retirement.  An indispensable guide for those wanting to know the southern California behind the glitz.	2003-12-12

Mr. Papucci has obviously embarked on a labor of love in recounting the up-and-down history of this franchise from its beginnings in 1969, and moving through the rough first years, the almost-move to Washington, D. C. which was averted when McDonald's founder Ray Kroc bought the club in 1974, the careers of legends Dave Winfield and Tony Gwynn, the astounding 1984 season that culminated in the Padres' first National League pennant and World Series appearance (the same year Ray Kroc died), the sale of the club by Joan Kroc to the Tom Werner group and later to John Moores, the so-called \\"fire sale\\" of 1992, the gradual rebuilding of the club that led to the 1998 National League championship (a sometimes overlooked event in that great baseball year), and culminating in the poignant farewell to Mr. Padre himself, eight-time National League batting champion Tony Gwynn, who spent his entire career with the Padres.    Mr. Papucci could have devoted some more space to some of the events off the field or shaped by those who never picked up a bat, ball or glove, which are as much a part of Padre history as what has transpired between the foul lines, such as the behind-the-scenes maneuverings that landed San Diego a major league franchise, the financial troubles of initial owner C. Arnholdt Smith, the long soap-opera-like struggle over where the Padres would play in 1974, the legal, political and financial maneuverings over the campaign for a new downtown ballpark (finally, Petco Park opened last year) to--yes!--National Anthem renditions.  As has been noted about another club history, an index at the back of the book would have been helpful.  However, the author is at his best in spotlighting players and managers known and loved by Padre fans, including not only Winfield and Gwynn but also Downtown Ollie Brown (the first player chosen), Nate Colbert (the club's first star), Chris Canizzaro, Cy Young Award winner Randy Jones, Ozzie Smith, Steve Garvey, Goose Gossage, Graig Nettles, Dick Williams, the indomitable Dave Dravecky, Bruce Bochy, Wally Joyner, Fernando Valenzuela, Rickey Henderson, Ken Caminiti and Trevor Hoffman.  This is a must-read for Padre fans or anybody interested in recent baseball history.	2003-12-11

This book has excellent postcard pictures not only of past buildings but even existing buildings and sites.  It also contains incredible documentary evidence of damage caused by the 1933 earthquake, which resulted in tightened code standards for construction (especially of public schools) in California.  I am sending a copy of this to a friend with Long Beach connections whose poetry book I reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.com.  Looking at these buildings you are familiar with and realizing they existed long ago gives me a feeling of continuity.  Books like this also give you an idea of where we were and how we came to be what we are today.	2003-12-10
US	24061187	RBQ37TEUOOX01	0385244371	933561767	Looking Forward: The George Bush Story	Books	4	1	1	N	N	More than just a campaign biography	I purchased the paperback version of this book just before George H. W. Bush began his successful 1988 Presidential campaign.  It is a very interesting read, covering not just Mr. Bush's World War II record, the 1980 Presidential campaign and his later partnership with President Ronald Reagan, but also his family and business endeavors in Texas after World War II (which were also written about by his wife, former First Lady Barbara Bush) and his efforts to build a viable Republican party in that state.  Anybody interested in the history of post-World War II Texas and Southern politics, particularly as one man has experienced and influenced it, and also in the background and upbringing of his son, our present President, will find this enjoyable.  Mr. Bush covers topics ranging from his defense of his support for a civil rights bill to his first encounter with chicken-fried steak.	2003-12-09

I'm a football fan (now a converted Charger fan) and the events recounted here bring back a lot of memories.  Gene Klein was a masterful storyteller.  His descriptions of such characters as Al Davis, Leonard Tose, Dan Fouts, and Rolf Benirschke are dead-on.  Just as interesting, in my opinion, is his recounting of his life and career before he bought the San Diego Chargers, and after he sold them (he turned to breeding race horses, one of whom, Tank's Prospect, won the 1986 Preakness Stakes).  His recounting of his days in the used car (\\"cheaper by the pound than hamburger!\\"), film theater and insurance businesses paints a vivid picture of what it was like in post-World War II southern California, when opportunity was waiting with open arms for those willing to take a chance.  He is not above recounting his mistakes, such as the time when he backed Minnie Pearl's Fried Chicken (a franchise named after the Grand Ole Opry legend), but when he sat down to take his first sampling of it, he developed HEARTBURN.  And there was the time when, trelying on the advice of his son, he passed up on the American concert rights to THE BEATLES.	2003-11-20

I knew the author when we both lived in the same city (and same apartment complex) while starting out in our careers, and resumed e-mail contact with her last year.  I'm glad that this book is still available; I own an autographed first edition.  It hits home with men as well as with women, and the poems deal with the vicissitudes of life and love for singles.  It is as timely today as it was when it was first published in 1975.  Fortunately for Marilyn, she eventually married and now has a teenage son, and still writes.	2003-11-18
