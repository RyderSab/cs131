Patricia Cornwell has to step aside! (Sorry, Pat!) Wow, this one delves into the prostitution arena as well as serial killing. Very interesting for psychologist Alex Delaware as he meets a former patient in a very -- uh -- compromising situation, and then begins working with her only to find she gets murdered and mutilated.<br /><br />Alex must find the killer, as this looks like a killing from the past that was never resolved. What a ride in this book from start to finish! Alex almost loses girlfriend Robyn in the process!<br /><br />A treat for any Kellerman fan, and a great thriller for anyone who just loves excitement. (And who doesn't?)<br /><br />Jonathan Kellerman ROCKS!	2005-08-31

I love Kellerman books, and he's got a winner here! Lucy Lowell comes to psychologist Alex Kellerman after she is a juror in a serial killer case. The horror brought out by that case caused Lucy to have nightmares about a little girl watching what could be a rape, murder, or burial. She doesn't remember that the little 4-year-old girl is herself until she goes under hypnosis.  <br /> <br />Alex, in his clever way, grabs cop friend Milo Sturgis and goes behind the scenes and tracks down the details of this case -- which is very real. People start dying all around them, and Alex and Milo realize they are on to something -- and it's not a dream.  <br /> <br />This is a great Kellerman book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a spooky thriller. Going back into  the past can be scary, and Kellerman makes it even more so in this case!	2005-08-07

It just wasn't as creative as Kellerman's thrillers usually are. <br /> <br />In this fine book, Kellerman explores an illness called Munchausen by proxy, where parents injure their children to get attention. This child is close to dying from whatever is going on. Either it's Munchausen, could one of her parents or other caretakers be poisoning 21-month-old Cassie on purpose? Or Cassie has an illness the docs can't identify. Alex finds evidence of what he thinks proves one situation to be the culprit -- and a person to be the culprit. But by the end of the case, he learns all is not what it seems -- even evidence. Alex must hurry his own investigation before the toddler dies! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, even tho I think the ending could have been more exciting. Many kudos to Kellerman for coming up with such bizarre storylines!	2005-08-07

In this great edition to the Alex Delaware psychologist/mystery solver series, a girl he treated many years ago visits Alex to ask for help for her mother. Gina, the recluse mom, was model-beautiful until someone threw acid on her face, and she never knew why. Get ready to find out why in this gripping thriller.  <br /> <br />Kellerman likes to show us that the most ordinary-looking and -acting of people often have a devious, frightening side. Gina doesn't have to look too far from home to find her kidnapper. That's good for her, since she's a recluse! <br /> <br />It's an understatement to say Kellerman is a master at the psychological thriller. He created the genre!	2005-08-07

This is about my fifth Kellerman novel, and I just love Jonathan Kellerman! This one piqued my interest in the beginning, but then it lost me somewhere in the middle, altho it had the usual dramatic end common of Kellerman! I just love his main character, Alex Delaware, and he is believable and funny and great in all of the books. <br /> <br />The plot in this one just wasn't all that great, in my humble opinion. It definitely put a new twist on the age-old \\"missing child\\" story, with the child having cancer and needing treatment in a germ-free, bubble-type world. That put more of an urgency to the issue of finding him. The \\"jungle\\" and other odd surprises toward the end of the book made it a worthwhile read for me. As I said in my last review, I have acquired a pile of Jonathan Kellerman books and am really excited to get through them all. In general, Kellerman uses so much imagery that you feel like you are right there with Alex as he makes his discovery. Altho not the best, this is a worthwhile read for anyone who likes a good thriller or just wants a new experience. Experience Kellerman!	2005-06-24
US	50916241	R11R4AY4B0HWXI	0345452577	999720718	The Conspiracy Club	Books	5	1	3	N	N	Cryptic clues	Another awesome Jonathan Kellerman book! He's a clinical psychologist with characters that are psychologists, namely Alex Delaware, who is in many books. In the case of The Conspiracy Club, Kellerman created a new character, Jeremy Carrier. This book got me from the first sentence: \\"Raging emotions, dead tissue.\\" From there, Kellerman takes the reader on a ride as spectacular as any amusement park can send you on. From an aging forensic pathologist and a group of unlikely friends, Carrier obtains cryptic clues to a serial killer who most likely also killed Carrier's wife.<br /><br />Carrier becomes a suspect as he discovers the serial killer is most likely a doctor who knows how to dissect people using laser technology. Carrier is a staff psychologist at a hospital where a couple of other suspects in the crimes work, including his girlfriend, Angela Rios, who is also a doctor. Jeremy begins working to solve the mystery because police are misguided and he realizes the killer might have also killed his wife. This takes him into the bowels of a high-rise building to catch the culprit.<br /><br />Jeremy's interviews with patients along the way include a cancer patient who probably got another illness due to something wrong in the treatment of his cancer the first time. The book takes the reader into the mind of Jeremy and shows what goes on in the work life of a psychologist. Particularly humorous is when Jeremy must take all of his patients and act like he's interested on the same day he thinks he figured out the killer's identity!<br /><br />Overall, a treat to any reader of mystery and thrillers, particular anyone who has read any of Kellerman's other novels. I'm hooked -- I've got to read each one, now!	2005-06-12
US	50916241	R22BUY9MZQHBAK	0553801929	562039873	Dark Horse	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Thriller and page-turner!	What a treat -- we get to learn a little bit about Tami Hoag in this book that is set in a show horse arena in Florida. Hoag has competed in dressage, a specialized type of horse competition that appears to be more like horse ballet. Dressage is a terrific and competitive sport -- I've seen them perform. The horses appear to fly! Hoag brings her love for and skill in dressage into this book and even uses some of her own horses' names in the book. <br /> <br />Elena Estes, the main character, plays an ex-cop who would rather disappear into the competition than live her life coping with being responsible for another officer to lose his life in a drug bust gone bad. She works to put the pieces of her life together and is helped when 12-year-old Molly Seabright asks her to come find her sister, Erin, who has been missing for a week. Estes wants to opt out but ends up intrigued in the disappearance, which turns out to be a kidnapping. On the same day Molly visits Elena, a $250,000 horse mysteriously dies from an overdose of a sedative. As Estes digs further into the case, a horse groom, like Erin, is killed by having her face pushed into horse manure. Whoa, horse! <br /> <br />Meanwhile, everybody looks guilty as Estes interviews people at the horse arena while trying to look like an innocent, rich girl like all the others running the competition. She fools most and finds herself in a world of hurt as the killer stalks her.  <br /> <br />The ending is such a delight. You have to read this one to believe it! Great job to Tami for a wonderful read and great, believable characters. Horse sportsmanship is far from dull! <br /> <br />	2005-06-01

I was wary when I first began reading the book because I thought it was going to be too similar to Dr. Kevorkian in the assisted suicides. But in this case, Dr. Eldon Mate takes his clients out to the middle of nowhere -- or sometimes to a motel -- to give them the fatal dose. <br /> <br />When Mate turns up dead -- carved up and undignified, unlike his patients were -- everyone has their suspicions. Family members of the most recent suicide? A copy-cat? Someone from a right-to-life group that doesn't believe in Mate's methods? Anything was possible, and Dr. Alex gets involved. It's a tough call, since many people think Mate got what he had coming to him by going against the grain and participating in assisted suicides, or murder, as some people saw it.  <br /> <br />This is sure to please anyone who likes gruesome crime novels, any fan of Dr. Alex Delaware, and of course, any Kellerman fan! He really delivers in this chilling book that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.	2005-06-01

Payne really delivers an action-packed look into the life of a business broker who lives just above the law -- and at times, a bit below. As long as Steve Draves doesn't get caught, anything goes. The reader really gets into Draves' head through Payne's vivid descriptions on his thoughts and actions. <br /> <br />Draves leads more than just a double life. A married man who would, at least, like to be cheating on his wife with a variety of women who tantalize and taunt Steve, at least from his perspective. A successful broker, Steve's family lives in a $12,000 house which is a bit modest for a millionaire, even in the 1960s. He plays the part of a struggling young father who keeps his wife on a $150 a week budget. He allows other businessmen to give him \\"advice\\" on career moves, while he watches his savings soar in his business deals. Even at his office, his life is for show. A tape recording of typewriter sounds constantly plays to make clients think there are 20-odd staff members working, when there is really only himself and his secretary. <br /> <br />Things become dicey when he begins telling his friend about his million-dollar deal with a mob boss who doesn't appreciate all of Draves' wheeling and dealing. Once the mobster gets wind of a mistake Steve's secretary made, he's on the run!   <br /> <br />Despite Steve's character being such a sexist, self-proclaimed Don Juan, I found myself secretly pulling for Steve, hoping he straightened out his life. The shock ending is much in line with the reality of Steve's actions and business dealings. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great ride. I found humor as well as poignancy on every page. I look forward to more fiction from Jack Payne! <br /> <br />	2005-03-13

(or should I say, designing!)	Whoa. This book is too unbelievable for words! And of course, that's exactly what it's about -- words. But not just words in print. Words in pictures shown on every page. Remember that a picture truly paints a thousand words....Then why the heck don't we have pictures in our books? <br /> <br />Kirschenbaum is a genius in the design of this book. I'm really wondering what kind of equipment she had in her home to be able to design such incredible pages for a reader's lust. Yes, we as lust for pictures. So we have the word \\"imagery,\\" which causes the words on the page to create pictures in our minds. But the thought that \\"serious\\" books can have color and pictures? ARE YOU KIDDING is the old attitude. As much as technology has improved things, we ARE that much in the dark ages when no one has produced this type of work to be revered by the highest of scholars! <br /> <br />I could not wait to turn the page -- every page -- in this book and see what she did next. As a new English teacher myself, I know that we teachers tell our high school students, when they must choose novels to read for class, that they must pick something that \\"is not a picture book.\\" Why? Because no serious books (before this one) ever dared to throw in color, and certainly not pictures! No, no -- that's for baby books! Or so we thought. Until now.... <br /> <br />I am an author of true crime, and I can only imagine how it would increase the suspense if only the pages were dripping with the color of blood as it's being described in print. Maybe a drawing of the offending shotgun. <br /> <br />The tests that Kirschenbaum tried with her students -- well, some people know that teachers like to borrow ideas from other teachers. Most teachers welcome sharing info because by doing so, we are improving learning for students beyond our own. I plan to try out the experiments, like the one on page 254, where she gave a reading selection in color to some students and black and white to others. I also teach aCommunications class to sophomores, and we talk about design. This will be such a wonderful book. <br /> <br />I would like to know how she came up with this ingenius idea. She even has inspirational quotes like \\"If alone I must stand, then alone I stand,\\" and others. People of all ages will want to read this book! <br /> <br />The pictures and drawings don't detract from the words, as scholars have apparently thought over the years. They don't detract from the \\"seriousness\\" of her topic of a new millennium for design. In fact, they emphasize the words and give them life. What more could any author want people to say about her work? <br /> <br />This is a must-read for everyone on the planet. She's tapping into a way to reach the so-called \\"illiterate,\\" who simply get overwhelmed when they look at a sea of gray on the pages of most books. Thumbing through such a book, it's no wonder people just give up. There is no life in the words. Not so -- by a long shot -- with Ms. Kirschenbaum's book. Bravo!	2005-02-10

Kellerman book, and WOW, this writer has me hooked already. The book has it all -- romance, rejection, confusion, a woman involved in pornography, there's blackmail, problems at the job level, issues with professional personalities in scholastic settings that are not so professional, and an interesting question -- which woman do you believe? And both women appear to share the same body. <br /> <br />This had me going from the first page to the last. Foreshadowing even kept you guessing -- you knew what was going to happen, or did you? Just when you thought, \\"I got it!\\" he added another twist to the plot. I was unprepared for the ending, as was the author's intention. I recently obtained another J. Kellerman book and am trying to hurry through my other stack of books so I can get to it! (Oh, I might just have to sneak it in there sooner....) <br /> <br />The characterization -- awesome. You feel like Alex is your best friend, or maybe even YOU, in another life. The descriptions make the reader feel THAT close to Alex. Excitement in this book never ends. I was annoyed when it ended because I wanted more, more, more! You must read this book and have the ride of your life, or at least your book-reading life. I have students who think reading is boring.

I just love Paula Begoun. The strides she's made possible for women everywhere is beyond belief. I loved her first edition of this book, and now this one brings so much more.  <br /> <br />One of the newest strides Paula's brought out in this book is new research on chemical exfoliants to help people with oily skin and those with wrinkles. She reminds us that THERE IS NO WRINKLE CREAM that can erase a single wrinkle. Yet here we are with options to improve the skin we have through AHAs and BHAs, AND she reminds us of how to prevent wrinkles in the future. Sunscreen! Worn daily, under makeup. One simple step to prevent those wrinkles that make us cringe when we look in the mirror. <br /> <br />But that's not all. She talks about her newsletter, where people can get the latest info before her next book edition comes out. She talks about advertising hocus-pocus and why there just IS NO WRINKLE CREAM. Sure, they've created creams with the claim of getting rid of wrinkles, but they don't work. So what does that mean? Women everywhere can save their money and forgo such creams! <br /> <br />Paula gives us the hope that a wrinkle cream might come out in the future -- anything's possible -- but until she tells us, don't spend money on that. <br /> <br />She talks about ingredients in products and what they do and don't do. She describes how smoking affects one's skin and makes a person age prematurely. She describes skin care for every skin type. <br /> <br />But she's not done! She talks about cosmetic surgery, the types that are out there and the prices. She even describes personal experiences with different types. <br /> <br />She gives a detailed description of how makeup should be applied and why shiny eyeshadows and BLUE should be avoided. Pictures are included of makeup application on a woman. She goes on to describe nail care. <br /> <br />Nope, she's still not done. THEN she tells all about men's skin care and suggestions women can give the men in their lives. Shetalks about baby skin care, and how teens can ease into makeup application without looking like they walk the streets, but more than just \\"a little pink blush and lip gloss.\\" Then she has a problem-solution section.  <br /> <br />Paula even has a wonderful section on how a woman can feel beautiful while undergoing cancer treatment. Written in very tender terms. <br /> <br />She uses humor and kicks the advertising and magazine hype in the...well, you know where! <br /> <br />READ this book if you are at all interested in your appearance, as you must be if you got this far in my review. Kudos to you, Ms. Begoun!	2005-02-10

I expected her book to be as good. It was not a bad book, just not as suspenseful as the description would have you believe. <br /> <br />First off, I don't understand it saying \\"A Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus Novel.\\" Rina had very little to do with the outcome, other than supporting Cindy a couple times against her father's ire. I know police officers, having been a police reporter, and Cindy didn't ring true as a rookie cop. Some of the aspects of her behavior did seem real, others didn't.  <br /> <br />The beginning kind of confused me because it starts out, not with a main character, but with this scary story a woman named Farin was involved in. You expect her to be the main character, but it's rather puzzling that she's not a major part of the book in any way.  <br /> <br />Who ended up being the stalker -- not an unusual person, where stalkers go, that's true. Stalkers are often people we know well. It just didn't seem like Mrs. Kellerman did her homework on how stalkers really act. Something just didn't ring true with this person. <br /> <br />I liked the character development of Cindy with her lover, and Cindy with her father and the other cops. The author gave great detail. It wasn't a page-turner for me although I certainly did want to find out what happened. I was just a little disappointed when I got there. <br /> <br />Overall, a very good read and interesting. I just wouldn't characterize it as a thriller.	2005-02-10
US	50916241	R7M45NHSSE1HC	0671775391	105401731	Cruel Doubt	Books	5	23	28	N	N	A real thriller	I don't usually comment on others' reviews, but I found a recent one not to be fair, in this case. McGinniss gave his usual, awesome description of this horrible murder, including detailed interviews with the investigators and especially Bonnie Von Stein and Chris Pritchard. A criticism was that it was one-sided. As a true crime author myself, I know that often the &quot;other side&quot; won't talk to the author, and I suspect this was the case here. In Bledsoe's &quot;Blood Games,&quot; another excellent depiction of this awful crime, it's obvious Bledsoe had cooperation from the defendants' families -- and it might be looked upon as one-sided since he didn't have too much cooperation, it seems, with Bonnie. The two books together, both dramatically and frighteningly written, give readers a full picture of what went on in that case. I give both books 5 stars. This case has intrigued me since I saw the movie Cruel Doubt, and I was ecstatic that Bledsoe, another great true crime author, also wrote a book on the subject!<br />One main reason that makes me think McGinniss wasn't able to get interviews with the defendants is the fact that his book doesn't mention &quot;Bart&quot; as the nickname for James Bartlett Upchurch III. How would anyone know that unless they'd interviewed the family? Sometimes it looks like, when people won't talk to us, that we just didn't bother to try to talk to them, but that's absolutely not true. I'm sure Mr. McGinniss tried and tried to get the defendants' and families' interviews.<br />McGinniss is just one of the forefathers, it seems, of terrific true crime with awesome imagery -- which makes the reader picture the crime and people in their heads without a movie being necessary! Mr. Bledsoe also is a top true crime writer. Neither book detracts from the other. Both are sublime depictions of one of the most bloody crimes police have seen.<br />My hat's off to both authors!	2004-06-13

That's not giving away the book, as he's mentioned as the killer on the back cover! I was ecstatic that this book was out after I read Cruel Doubt by Joe McGinniss, another awesome depiction of this bloody crime. Joe apparently couldn't get the defendants' families to cooperate, and Bledsoe did. It was great to see into the minds of the killers and to learn about what their family lives were like growing up that might have affected their choices as young men.<br />Through the literary trick of imagery, Bledsoe makes the reader see the crime occur and understand the feelings of the defendants and their family members. Bledsoe gets to the very heart of the American family and how even the best and most doting parents can have children who become criminals. Of course, no parent is perfect, as Neal's and Bart's were not, but these young men had the background that many people have who later become doctors, lawyers and successful businessmen. If only these men hadn't chosen drugs, they could be among the successful. They had so much promise. Bledsoe brings home, through interviews with these teens and their parents, the reality of evil, as it can strike anyone, and how one rash decision has such dire, final consequences. <br />Also worth mention was the care and concern of the teacher who discovered Neal's genius and Bart's exceptional talents. Even to the end, he was defending them, making it clear he didn't agree with and couldn't condone their actions. A truly caring person this teacher must be!<br />As a true crime author myself, I can only say I hope I can someday climb into the caliber of Mr. Bledsoe, and I thank him for a terrific edition to America's true crime genre!	2004-06-13

The children have some mental/behavior issues, which places this in a high-risk category as a choice for families. They all love me, which is a BIG plus and a hurdle I don't have to worry about!<br />The best part about the book is that ALL of the worries I've had in making my decision to marry into this family are mentioned by other stepparents. My boyfriend thought I was weird being worried about all these things, but they are typical concerns -- and SHOULD be concerns, according to the book.<br />The book is not only written by stepparents but contains hundreds of quotes from other stepparents.

Some biographies get a bit dull in the details, but this book told the tale in very interesting tidbits from people who knew both actors. Lasky's details are superb regarding Vivien's manic depressive psychosis and lets readers get the feel for the disease by telling what Vivien did and said that showed the psychosis, rather than just saying she has manic depression/bipolar. <br />I'm studying bipolar and unipolar depression in actresses and did not know until I read an earlier biography that Vivien had it. She's been one of my favorite actresses, along with Marilyn Monroe, who I'm also studying regarding her depression. Lasky does a very good depiction of bipolar in this book that leaves a reader without any doubt of its nature.<br />Love Scene has many photos, which also tell the tale, and interviews with people who knew the couple closely, including directors, producers and other actors and actresses. A fast read and one that gives an eye view into theatre and cinema. You won't have any doubt this couple was made for each other by reading this book. The bipolar finally is Vivien's undoing when she, in a manic episode, makes an unfortunate comment on camera about Olivier that he can't forgive. <br />A sad but lovely story.	2004-02-10

The photos are wonderful, as you watch the transition from Norma Jeane to Marilyn, get to see her wedding photo to Jim Dougherty and hear words of Joe DiMaggio and learn some of the insides of Hollywood as Marilyn shared them with her sister.<br />Sadly, the book also describes how Berniece was hounded by the press and had a hard time leading a &quot;normal&quot; life. No privacy. I was hoping the book would give more insight into Marilyn's death, but Berniece and Mona are as much in the dark as anyone. Interesting is the denial of any relationship with President John F. Kennedy or brother Bobby. That seems to be a given in most books about Marilyn. However, if you read between the lines here, Marilyn doesn't deny a relationship, she just smiles when Berniece asks and says &quot;they're just boys.&quot; There could be a lot Marilyn doesn't share with her sister!<br />But what comes shining through in this book is how loving and lovable Marilyn was, and how much she was loved by her sister. The idea of a mentally ill mother explains a lot of things, like Marilyn's obvious depression. The sisters not even knowing about each other until Marilyn was 12 and Berniece 19 is sad, but at least they had each other through the rest of Marilyn's life.<br />This is a lovely book, beautifully written, tragic as it must have been. It shows Marilyn as more of the earthy woman her family knew, which is a refreshing perspective from other Marilyn Monroe biographies!	2004-02-05

I finally obtained a 1974 copy of the book and read it just recently. WOW! Is it ever true that the book is better than the movie! So much is explained, and the ending is so different. Peter's ability to get into the mind and soul of the character makes it more than just another thriller, it makes one to read again and again. I'm glad he did the screenplay because it was more true to the book than it would have been, although so much can't be seen in a movie that can be described in a book.<br />The relationship between the chief's wife and Hooper was unexpected and very realistic. The graphic detail was (astoundingly) better described than the movie could ever help to show, as well as the victims' fears and feelings before death. Talk about type-casting in the movie with Matt Hooper played by none other than Richard Dreyfuss and Quint as Robert Shaw! This book is one readers of any age will love and remember, as well as pass along to their own children. Peter Benchley is a genius!	2004-01-21

This one was easy to get into and very heart-jerking when character John Pellam's friend is blown up in a van and accused post-mortem of being involved in drugs. As seems a bit unusual, the death causes Pellam to be fired from his film producing job, but that's OK because it gives him time to solve his friend and co-worker's death. He's certain it's murder, and he's right. He also gets a taste of small town life in the process. Highly recommended!	2004-01-21

I just adore Mary Higgins Clark's novels, and this book is no exception to the rule! In this book, all is not as it seems in the murder of a beautiful young famous actress. Her sister comes to learn the truth and stumbles onto her main suspect at a spa just before his trial. Many twists and turns later -- and another murder or two thrown in for good measure -- the sister, Elizabeth Lange, must face some truths about her past and her sister's world.

A bit different than the movie, but in many ways better because the reader gets to see into the minds and thoughts of Laura/Sara and Martin, as well as Ben. The movie couldn't help but use some of the parts of the book in exact form, such as the breaking of the lights so Sara finds her way home after jumping off the boat. So many women in similar situations will find inspiration in Sara's courage -- and realism in the book, as she almost turns back a few times and almost calls Martin, despite finding him a monster.<br />Sara has obviously been beaten many times and frightened of her husband, stays far longer than she should. But the soul-wrenching part is, she DOES get away, and she's able to live again. Highly recommended for all readers of thrillers and especially people interested in domestic violence.	2004-01-21

When a friend lent me a copy of this book, I had to buy myself one. This is such a terrific addition to literature and I am so enlightened to have read it. I read Codependent No More over and over with a 1980s copy, and I never would have guessed what Ms. Beattie went through to get where she's at today. Prostitution so she could get drugs, rape from drugged stupors, her arm being photographed with all its needle marks and used to show school children the horrors of drug use -- the clinicians certainly never thought she'd amount to anything, but she learned codependency is the root of all addiction.<br />A wonderful read. It will make you cry! It did me. A lot of people, men and women, will see themselves in her story. It really makes a person appreciate how she knows so much about codependency and is such an authority. Personal experience, that's what she has to share. I love her meditation books, too. Such an inspiration and used in Codependents Anonymous meetings everywhere. Her books should be a must-read for high school students. She can help people before it's too late.<br />Her humor in the book is especially wonderful because with all she went through, it makes one wonder what she could find to laugh about, and her humor just further brings home what an astounding woman Ms. Beattie is!	2004-01-21

Awesome characterization, plot	I guess I'm in the minority in just loving this book, looking at a lot of reviews on amazon. I'm stumped. I was jumping for joy  when I saw the new Patricia Cornwell/Scarpetta book on the shelf, as I always am. Kay Scarpetta is just my all-time favorite heroine, and I love all the gory, medical investigator detail in Cornwell's books. I remember when Point of Origin came out and the readers' reviews all echoed the same thought -- the Scarpetta series was over. But no! And I knew &quot;he&quot; (not wanting to give away too much of the book) was still alive! I just didn't think it would be three books later until he resurfaced.<br />I agree with some of the reviewers that Jean-Baptist Chandonne is getting a little used up as a villain, and this ending sets up yet another book on the man. Then again, how many serial killers are out there realistically in the world that Scarpetta can run into as savage as the Wolfman? Sure, all serial killers are savage, but some books on the market and movies make ya wonder how some characters just HAPPEN to attract serial killers like -- flies? There are surely more out there than people know of, but not as many as books and Hollywood would like you to think. <br />I was glad for a couple reuniting and just loved the ending. Finally! I've been waiting and waiting for this reunion. The foreshadowing was right there at the beginning of Black Notice. Pooh on the other reviewers, this is another great Scarpetta book by the queen of forensic thrillers. A fast read building lots of suspense in the way the chapters moved back and forth from character to character. Getting inside the mind of the other killers, a couple, also was a treat. Readers also get into the mind of some of the victims, who don't believe a drop-dead gorgeous man could be a killer! When's the next one coming out, Patricia? Hurry! Your Scarpetta fans are waiting.	2004-01-21

Haunted by this accident she blames on herself, Menley envision her new baby daughter's death in many ways. Her lawyer husband takes her to Cape Cod to relax, and the problems erupt further. Clark has you rooting for Menley the entire way, and even leads readers into the bowels of an old home the Nichols' rent and the secrets it holds.

He discovers to his pleasure, Sabrina Radcliffe, a management consultant of clout, is his daughter.

Such a sad and compelling book -- I really wish I could meet Nick Traina. Sad to think of someone committing suicide when they could use their tragedy to help others with the same illness, in Nick's case, bipolar disorder/manic-depression. Well, I guess he did that anyway through his mother's book. It also gives us a great insight into Danielle Steel. You always wonder what a celebrated author is like -- are they nice, to they just give people the shove off, etc. After reading this, I just LOVE Danielle Steel! The love that she showed toward her son is just extraordinary. Trying to understand him, desperately searching for some diagnosis, wanting to help him. I'm just completely impressed (and jealous) of the love she showed her son. All parents should take note!<br />Of course the other part is that it shows bipolar illness so well, and what people would be like if they weren't on medication. And Nicky is just such a neat person. I bet he could have found SOME way to tour despite his illness and still become a rock star. Stay on his lithium and take a nurse with him or something. He was something great, but could have been so much more. Such potential in that boy. <br />Gripping book and a page-turner!	2002-07-09

But this is just astonishingly wonderful! Conroy really knows dysfunctional families.

The author really shows the passion, the hate, the evil and human nature, all in one book. Forgiveness of amazing, torturous abuse also is shown in an amazing way.<br />Very believable characters, likeable. It's like he lived my life and knows my family!	2002-05-25

A father who gives his 14-year-old daughter handfuls of drugs before manipulating her into killing her stepmother \\"If she really loved him.\\" Worse yet, the man marries the dead wife's sister, only two years older than his daughter. Is that enough for him? No, then he plots for THIS wife's death. Or does he? Is it all a crazy, messed up teen-ager who then tries to commit suicide?

Readers will have to dig into this book to know.<br />Very detailed, written like a novel, a great read! Also a Lifetime movie, but the book's way better!<br />I read an updated version with an afterword from 2002 from Ms. Rule. Nice to know what these people are doing now!

I wouldn't say this is Nora Roberts' best, but it was certainly a great thriller and wonderful, believable characters that you couldn't help rooting for! The idea of a priest's garments used to kill the victims was great. The idea of a psychiatrist, our protagonist, Dr. Tess Court, being used to do a psychological profile and continuing on in the case, was a great idea, and brought a super character to life. The doubting cop, Ben Paris, also was believable, as cops think counseling is \\"hokie.\\" The fireworks between the two were entertaining to see.<br />A bit less of the sex scenes than usual, don't know if that's good or bad! I guess depending on who the reader is. The romance was all there, though, and the tension between the lovers. The murders could have been a little spookier, and, as Roberts is famous for the macabre, they could have been a little more gruesome for the morbidly curious!<br />As usual, Roberts includes a mixture of love and a scary thriller.

I read a 1968 older copy. Fits in today's world, too! I have to admit that I HATE Piet, although he seems to be the &quot;main&quot; character. I hate how he just jumps from bed to bed to bed, although he finally makes the right decision. The book makes marriage seem like a dead end, although there are so many marriages that ARE like that! Maybe it's a chance to show us how we behave as humans, and maybe we can work on our relationships to keep the fire going and not turn out like his characters!<br />Something else that made me uncomfortable about Piet is his comparing one woman's body parts to another. Makes ya wonder if guys really do that -- of course it would have to be really promiscuous men! But I'm sure men DO compare ex-girlfriends' bodies to new girlfriends. It makes me feel self-conscious.<br />Updike does a good job in the book of pointing out our flaws and greatest fears in relationships, and showing beginnings and endings of relationships. It's a very intellectual study. Great book!	2002-01-03

This book captures you from the very beginning and makes you see the world through the eyes of Dr. Sarah Baldwin. Very detailed medical information and a fast read. Keeps you going from the first page to the last. <br />Dr. Baldwin is the kind of doc most people in this open-minded society would want to have -- one with the Western science medicine as well as using holistic practices such as accupuncture. She gets in trouble after two women die and one woman is maimed in their pregnancies after taking her herbal supplement for pregnancy, which she recommends instead of the usual vitamins. An intrigue follows which delves into politics and money.

This book keeps you enraptured from the first page to the last. Surprising testimony in one hearing makes no doubt in the reader's mind that this is the man who committed the crime. The gruesomeness of the crime is astonishing, and well-described in clinical terms -- but the emotional impact still comes out in the telling of the tale. The sickness of a man who seems like the boy next door is terrifying. These people could be your next-door neighbor. <br />The writing in this book is brilliant, ripping at the reader's heartstrings. <br />A special ending of the book satisfies readers' questions as to a theory as to the terror the victim endured. Of course, it's a guess, but the inclusion of it strengthens the book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes true crime. Well-written, well-researched, leaving no stones unturned. It is a masterpiece! I am sure to be a fan of these authors!	2001-12-03

This would get 5 stars for the inclusion of photos from the books alone. The writing could have been more detailed and written a bit better. I DID like that the authors included information from the period during which the NDs were written -- the '30s through today -- and how teens were changing over the years. Nancy Drew changed and grew along with today's teens, although die-hard fans wish the syndicate hadn't changed a WORD.<br />I was a little disappointed with the reading of the book, but had just finished &quot;The Nancy Drew Scrapbook&quot; which is AWESOME, so that might be why I was expecting more from this book.

This was the best and most well-researched book I've ever read about Nancy Drew. Not only does Ms. Plunkett-Powell &quot;introduce&quot; us to the REAL Carolyn Keene -- Mildred Wirt Benson -- but she gives us a history of how the idea for Nancy Drew was born and some of the politics involved in it for Wirt when Stratmeyer died and his daughter, Harriet, took over everything and tried to control too much of the writing. We learn which NDs weren't written by Wirt, and how much of the writing was changed as well as the covers.<br />She tells collectors how to know the worth of their stash. She goes through each of the characters and their start with the series. She even talks about the TV show and MOVIES in the 1930s that were made -- more for the fun of it than to truly showcase the books. Info about Russell Tandy, the illustrator of the early books and the first to design covers, also is described.<br />She hasn't forgotten anything.

It's hard to put down! Characters are believable. You want to shake Jennifer Witt, and make her admit she's a battered woman. And you also want to force her into counseling (with a woman, please -- you'll understand if you read the book!). The book also makes you want to hug Jennifer and her mother, Nancy, and tell them how beautiful and worthwhile they are, and that they deserve better men than the ones they choose. <br />A VERY good description of the mind of the battered woman who loves her husband, and the desperate lady who falls in love with the wrong man, very wrong, deadly wrong. Captures deep emotion.<br />The lawyers are very believable. I've met lawyers just as heartless as David Freeman and just as giving, loving and determined as Dismas Hardy.<br />Of course, Hardy is the character you fall in love with in the book, loving husband and father, determined defense attorney.<br />The 13th Juror is shocking, with a great surprise ending you will never guess. Hardy lucked out -- I'm afraid in real life, this woman would have gotten the death penalty.<br />A fast read, MUST READ for anyone interested in crime and courtroom drama. Anyone who knows a battered woman or who has been battered should read this powerful book.	2001-10-24

The love, relationships, sex and realistic examples of human suffering, failing, trying again, making mistakes in choices in relationships, hurting others, getting hurt.... These are BEAUTIFULLY shown in this book. You feel you know the characters personally and want to tell them what to do! I have to say, although loving someone and waiting for them for 50 years is admirable, Florentino Ariza also kind of reminded me of a stalker! A fatal attraction? I think he seemed that way to Fermina Daza too, but this &quot;fatal attraction&quot; turns out not to be fatal. A lovely display of the possibilities of love. <br />This book is just a wonderful study of life and love, stunningly detailed, so well-written prose that you just have to marvel at Garcia Marquez's talent as a great writer, one of the best!<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing.

A very interestingly-written book, a page-turner. A BIBLE for those who feel they must lose weight. I don't like diets and don't usually follow them, but this one makes sense and it explains physiologically why you lose weight on it and why protein is such a power in itself. The part on exercise is great too -- it explains types of exercise that are a waste of time and the right type for weight loss, health, and that physique we all want! One of my fave parts is where it talks about &quot;growth hormones&quot; and why young people can eat whatever they want and not gain weight. This book actually SHOWS you how to turn your body back into that younger person's type of body -- where you can eat what you want and lose! We adults can still be youthful and virile!

This is a SUPERB book for those wanting to renew their love, find out how to love better, or just read a well-written, lovely book! It's amazing that love has languages too, but they are as different as anything, and Chapman really details them out for ya. You might be getting a marriage-survival guide in this book! It also helps people to understand how other people express love in non-verbal ways and how you might need to express love in non-verbal ways. Lots of great examples, this is a MUST HAVE book for all lovers -- and we are all lovers, aren't we?	2001-09-17

I read this book over and over. It's a keeper. 'Course my edition is from 1987!! Beattie has become a household name in codependency issues, and this is a page-turner, as well as having ME on every page of the book (yep, unfortunately, I'm QUITE codependent). But beyond that, Beattie has an interesting writing style, gets the reader involved from the get-go, and really puts her heart and soul into the book.

A super mix of all sorts of relationships, but especially quadriplegic Lincoln Rhyme the great criminologist!! Ever showing us we can be something and be GREAT no matter what our disability!

This was an exciting thriller from the first paragraphs, where a boy finds a victim in the horrendous stabbed &quot;artwork&quot; of the killer. Roberts does very well with characterization. Before you are a quarter of the way into the book, you're hooked on the characters and their problems.  The characters are very believable.<br />Of course, I especially liked the sexual tension and interactions between the two main characters, Caroline Waverly and Tucker Longstreet. The description of the town makes the reader feel that they are there. <br />The plot is very exciting and doesn't stop adding tension from the very beginning to the surprise ending. No one would ever have guessed the killer's identity! <br />There was plenty for the morbidly curious -- lots of blood and gruesomeness from the serial killer. An all-around enjoyable and thrilling book. Bravo, Roberts!	2001-01-26
US	50916241	R140HLIWNQJZ8Z	0515122734	942831312	Sanctuary	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Enticing, frightening, stunning!	This is my second Nora Roberts. I must read more! In Sanctuary, she brings a sick killer who photographs his dead, naked &quot;subjects&quot; and sends one to a famous photographer, Jo Ellen Hathaway, who has a mental collapse and then returns to her family home, Sanctuary, which has been partially rented out to guests on their island off the coast of Savannah, GA. The family tension is shown in excellent detail -- nobody trusting anyone in the family or outside because their mother mysteriously disappeared 20 years earlier, and they believed she deserted them.<br />Add to the mix a man, Nathan Delaney, who desires the cold, closed-off Jo, a relationship between Joe's sister, Alexa, and a lifetime love,Giff, and a push-pull relationship between their brother, Brian, and an island doctor, Kirby Fitzsimmons. Each of these explosive couplings bring entertainment and romance to the book as the reader learns about each character and their flaws, as well as what they all have to learn about love and loss. Of course, there's a fourth &quot;relationship,&quot; between Jo and a killer who stalks her, from Charlotte, NC, to Sanctuary.<br />As usual, Roberts' title befits the story -- the house is called Sanctuary, and it is to find sanctuary that Jo returns home. All the characters, in their own ways, find sanctuary in the house of their childhood. They must have courage to learn the terrible secret Nathan must bring them, which is tied to their past, to the killings befalling the island, and to the killer who has come to live among them. Chilling!	2001-01-26

Deaver isn't searching for a psychopathic Hannibal Lector, here, an evil person who has no morals nor cares for others. Deaver instead does a great job of getting inside the mind of none other than a paranoid schizophrenic. The meaning behind the non-meaning in the world of such a mental patient who escapes life in a hospital for the criminally insane. What is interesting and seemingly Deaver's goal in this book is not to scare us all about schizophrenics but instead to get inside the minds of his characters. To get at the fear that we all have of the mentally ill. Will society ever be able to understand? Are the mentally ill all violent, simply because they are mentally ill?<br />The reader is left to figure this out while following the people chasing after Michael Hrubek, as well as the woman with a past who readers believe Michael is trying to track down.<br />A great book for those interested in psychiatry. Deaver has done his homework, as is usual for him.	2000-12-04

I was glad for the somewhat slow beginning, but one that shows Kay as a human being, rather than this ultra-perfect, untouchable medical investigator who never sleeps or celebrates any holidays. Murder doesn't respect holidays or human life. After Kay's lover's murder, she just threw herself into work. The Last Precinct gives Kay a beginning where she can cry -- yes, Dr. Scarpetta can actually cry! -- and look inward at her own suffering, instead of only other people's suffering. <br />Murder continues in Kay's life, and she has to continue being a medical investigator, even while she is being investigated as a perpetrator of the very crimes she has to investigate. The surprise ending brings back Benton's murder and police deputy chief Diane Bray's murder, both from Cornwell's last Scarpetta book, Point of Origin. The ending puts the murders and other aspects of Kay's life in perspective, as Kay's professional life changes forever. A must read for those who have learned to love Kay Scarpetta from Cornwell's other books.<br />The book is still a little slow in the reading, and would be a hard read for someone new to Scarpetta, although the end to the so-called Werewolf murders and a look inside Kay's life keeps those familiar with the series moving along in the book. I guessed correctly who was behind the murders about three-quarters of the way into the book, but I didn't make all the connections, and I'm not sure someone unfamiliar with this series would have been able to figure it out. I was a bit disappointed that I was able to guess the ending, but I still liked the book. Cornwell still remains my favorite crime novelist, and Kay my favorite protagonist!	2000-11-27

She couldn't stand those words. &quot;Too limiting,&quot; she told someone. Alexander Walker captured this and many other oddities and about Vivien Leigh in his vivid biography of the woman who stunned the nation by going from virtually unknown to loved by all after starring in the movie &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Little did anyone suspect the star of this movie battled with bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depression. Walker describes her battle and how the mentally-unstable character Blanche Dubois in the stage and, later, movie productions of &quot;Streetcar Named Desire&quot; pretty adequately reflected Vivien's real state of mind.<br />When an actor or actress can become as great as Vivien Leigh and still fight with an illness like mental affliction, it makes readers care even more for the person behind the role. This book made me feel protective of Vivien Leigh, as Walker mentions her supporting actors and actresses did, despite Vivien's occasional manic rages.<br />Walker's book sheds light on Vivien's psyche, her movies and plays, her relationship with Sir Laurence Olivier, and her affairs both during this relationship and during her first, to Leigh Holman, the man whose first name became her last.	2000-11-12

What an anniversary for her! This book,  originally printed in 1987, is timely today just as it  was then, detailing the heart-wrenching story of three sisters, torn from each other at a young age. Each sister went to a different family and had a different upbringing, with the oldest having been beaten and raped in her  experiences in foster homes. Finally making it on their own, they are brought out of their lives in their thirties and are  brought together by the very man who separated them, after he hires a private investigator to find them.<br />Little does the man know a big surprise is in store for  him at the reunion. <br />The sisters reunite and swear never to stray far again.<br />A TV movie was made of the book, with Jacklyn Smith playing the oldest daughter. A very compelling movie, taken very carefully from the book and shown in a sequence of flashbacks.<br />An excellent book!	2000-11-11

It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses. <br />I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!<br />Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton.	2000-11-04

Who wouldn't want to spend the day exploring an old house for hidden secrets with none other than Nancy Drew! Her lack of the use of expletives as a teen-ager is as refreshing as her intellect and charity at solving crime for free.<br />I'm rereading my old, classic, Nancy Drew mystery stories. This one sure was a delight, as Nancy tries to help two old ladies from going crazy -- or selling their house cheaply to a cheat! The book takes Nancy into hidden passages behind secret panels, just a JOY for people who like a good mystery in an old house.<br />I used to search my own house, hoping for a secret panel!	2000-11-04

Harris mentions that he didn't &quot;know&quot; Hannibal Lecter was going to be in this book or even in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot; It makes the book more eerie; like the book wrote itself through Harris, just using him as a medium.How much more powerful Hannibal seems when the author himself is &quot;used&quot; by Hannibal the Cannibal! <br />The plot was terrific; just enough gore and human frailties as well as psychological phenomenon. <br />An A+ to Thomas Harris for Red Dragon!	2000-10-16

The identity of the person in the book who is able to break the  spell of the man who believes (or is) the Devil is very shocking  indeed.<br />This book was very entertaining and the sexual innuendos are  unusual in this genre of books in which the heroine is usually a virgin who  saves herself somehow, despite the male romantic figure's efforts to save  her.<br />&quot;The Devil on Lammas Night&quot; was a titilating read, making  one wonder about the power of suggestion.	2000-08-27

Never could a statement be more true of  Monroe, for people who knew her say she wasn't happy with her stardom and  wanted just a simple life. She wanted a happy marriage and a baby. She took  numerous medications and overdosed a couple of times unsuccessfully in her  life -- but most people who knew her say these were accidents, and that she  knew her medications well enough not to take too many.<br />It appears to  readers of books on her life that although she was a fairly suicidal  person, she really didn't want to die. She just wanted to live a different  life than she lived. <br />This book is a very fast read and a very  interesting perspective. The author definitely believes Marilyn meant to  kill herself, despite all the hype and investigations into her death.  <br />Marilyn, with her depressions and moodiness, was probably very difficult  to understand for someone who hasn't been there. On the outside looking in,  it DOES appear that her death was by  her own hand. But other accounts show  Marilyn to be at the best health and close to being very happy when she  died. <br />Anyone interested in Marilyn should read this book.	2000-08-27

But any book in the Scarpetta series would be hard-pressed to beat  Ms. Cornwell's last book, &quot;Point of Origin,&quot; in terms of shock,  tension, and characterization. In &quot;Black Notice,&quot; the tension  between Scarpetta and the new woman police chief who is trying to make her  job more difficult (someone is always doing that to poor Dr. Kay),  distracts readers from what the reader really wants to see -- how Kay is  coping with death in her own life.<br />The hint that Benton may still be  alive definitely adds excitement to the reader, but if Ms. Cornwell brings  him back from some hidden assignment, she'll have to do a good job piecing  the puzzle together. <br />The violence of Benton's death in &quot;Point of  Origin&quot; fits perfectly with the violence he has seen in life. It is  reminiscent of the death scene in the movie &quot;Bonnie and Clyde.&quot; A  reviewer described the way the stars and the director performed the ending,  as the bodies were killed many times over by bullets, as a  &quot;ballet.&quot; The end to the robbers and killers was befitting the  crime. Similarly, the end of Benton's life couldn't have been more fitting,  although it just about killed ME to read it. I was yelling, &quot;No, no,  no! She can't do this to me!&quot; Of course, when you like a character  that much and dislike the method of death that much -- that's a sign of a  great plot and a tribute to the author. To bring him back now would be  difficult.<br />One more thing troubling me about &quot;Black Notice,&quot;   is that when Dr. Scarpetta reads the autopsy report for Benton, it appears  to only mention that his face has been burned off. In &quot;Point of  Origin,&quot; Scarpetta definitely sees his face before the end. I don't  want to spoil either book for the reader, and I hope I haven't. If this is  tobe your first Cornwell book, I'd suggest reading &quot;Point of  Origin&quot; first. Actually, I'd suggest reading all of her Scarpetta  books first, because the relationship evolves throughout them all.	2000-08-27

The book takes you back to the very first Barbie doll and shows you how you can tell if you have an authentic doll. It also goes through many of the boxed, collectible Barbies and gives  a price list for the older and newer boxed dolls and their value if never  removed from the box (NRFB) and if they HAVE been removed. Usually, it's a  dramatic difference, so if you can handle it, leave these lovely beauties  in their boxes! As the boxes get more and more modern, the box itself is  going to be valuable.<br />I was reading in a doll magazine the other day  about whether boxes really are all that important, and one collector/seller  said if she just saw a box being sold alone for one of her sets at an  antique shop, she'd purchase it just to complete her set!<br />This book was  recommended to me by a very reputable Barbie doll seller who sold me my  first vintage Barbie (a #5 brunette who is gorgeous!). I agreed as soon as  I took a look at it. Not only does it describe Barbies, but it shows the  pictures in more than 1,800 photos! A detailed index allows you to look up  specific dolls without having to search through the whole book.  Collectible, designer, porcelain and children's favorites are described in  this 1996 book, which is well worth the price! If you have any interest in  collecting Barbies, buy this book!	2000-07-04

Current clothes for Barbie are gorgeous, but I just can't help getting caught up in the past -- and a peek and the thousands of photos in this book and the description of the dresses is just wonderful.

Any Barbie lover will doubt that notion when  they see this cover! A blown up shot of our gorgeous #1 hero (pun intended,  the doll shown is the first Barbie ever made!). <br />I purchased this book  because I have always collected Barbie and I love Barbie clothes,  especially ball gowns. Oh, the current clothes sold in stores are  beautiful, but the old clothes are just hot, hot, hot! What made me  purchase this fashion book in particular was the other customer reviews in  Amazon.com; these other customers were definitely satisfied and described  just what I was looking for -- photos and descriptions of the clothes along  with their number in their series (like the 800, 900, 1600 series for  Barbie and the 700 series for Ken). That way, when you shop on the internet  and a vendor says it has no. 816, you can look in the book and see what it  is and if you want it!<br />I can't say enough about Sarah Sink Eames except  she's certainly done her homework, and readers should keep up with her  work!

It's refreshing, in this biography, to read what a humble man this gorgeous, virile man had. Far  from being the Rhett Butler-egomaniac, Gable actually thought he wasn't  &quot;that good-looking!&quot; &quot;I'm just a lucky slob from Ohio,&quot;  Gable is quoted in the book as telling an interviewer.<br />Known largely for  his on-stage role as Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind, also starring  Vivien Leigh -- and his off-screen romance with Carole Lombard, Gable wooed  more women than he ever could have bedded, what with those &quot;come  hither&quot; eyes and dimples. Every woman who watched Gone With the Wind  would have changed places with Vivien in a second in the famous  &quot;rape&quot; scene where he roughly sweeps Scarlett in his arms and  carries the kicking and screaming wife up the stairs. Of course, anyone who  knows anything about love, Scarlett and that movie knows it surely wasn't  rape!<br />Tornabene's book explores Gable's extreme professionalism as an  actor and bits and pieces of the private life he chose to hide while alive.  He was even described by the media as &quot;boring&quot; because he  wouldn't talk about his private life!<br />Interesting in the book is that  this journalist decided to make a most humble move and talk to a  pscyhologist about the research to gain a different view of Clark Gable, as  research alone provided pieces to the Gable puzzle but not the entire  picture.	2000-07-03

However, books like this are very interesting to read, as is this  one. <br />How convenience store robberies differ from other robberies is  especially interesting where I live in Gallup, NM., because for some  reason, we seem to have them almost every other month. (A bit of an  exaggeration, but we get a lot of store robberies.) In my 6 and a half  years as police reporter in Gallup, I saw so many reports on convenience  store robberies that I can't even count them! Of course we've had many  other types of robberies, and I can see the difference in the mind-set of  someone who is going to commit, say, a a bank robbery or an armed robbery  at someone's house.<br />And if death or other violence comes into play during  the crime, that's another element altogether. Do these robbers really  expect to become murderers when they get out their guns and &quot;hit&quot;  a store? Or is it all for the rush and a murder is just a &quot;necessary  evil?&quot; Interesting questions.<br />The author did a great job of digging  into the very nature of these bandits.	2000-07-03

But his writing style and pace will make every reader not want to put it down until  they've read it cover to cover. The idea of having &quot;spy-master&quot;  Walker write a beginning portion of the book was wonderful and very  eye-opening.<br />It's scary to think of all the loopholes the government can  stoop to. And the American people put their trust and faith in the  government (usually). Of course, everyone working in government from the  president on down puts their pants on one leg at a time and uses the  bathroom just like the rest of us, but there's a certain sense of awe in  Americans that people in these high positions, also CIA, Secret Service,  etc., will be upstanding people. Simply checking if someone has ever been  convicted of a felony before letting them in certain jobs isn't enough to  tell that they won't be bought out once they take that job.<br />Morse shows  readers that our fears are very justified about our government today and  that we should take notice of what he has uncovered -- which is our  history, now -- and how this applies to what we can do and expect in our  future.<br />A very telling book, told by an author who, I hope, will keep on  busting corruption.	2000-07-03

The plot of doctors getting murdered in very gruesome manners and the passages where the killer's thoughts were  described -- while not identifying the killer is excellent! I loved the  relationship between the forensic pathologist, Joanna Blalock, and the cop,  although that seemed a little too close for comfort to Patricia Cornwell's  Dr. Kay Scarpetta and her FBI boyfriend. However, many cop books portray  relationships between cops and other cops or other people in law  enforcement, and in real life, this happens all the time! The reputations  of doctors being on the line during a malpractice suit was very realistic  and moved along at a good pace between all the murders, blood and guts --  and stray hands falling here and there. Definitely a book for the morbidly  curious. That's me!	2000-07-02

In  this book, an English journalist decides to take a personal view of her  tabloid assignment to find three women who followed an author's insights  that women can have affairs without emotions becoming involved just as  easily as men. On top of that, the descriptions of her husband and his  hypochondria is very well presented. The journalists first adulterated  encounter is passion-filled and just hilarious at the end. She handles a  BIG problem like a pro. I liked the slightly unbelievable ending. The name  of the book is simply awesome, as is the cover. &quot;Neurotica,&quot;  combining the woman's &quot;eurotic&quot; adventures and her husband's  &quot;neurotic&quot; tendencies. The cover with the bare legs up in the air  suggesting sex and the stethoscope on the legs almost suggesting a speculum  but actually symbolizing the husband's own stethoscope and other medical  supplies. A compulsive mother thrown in for good measure just puts the  cherry on the prize! This is a great read and is one of the first British  humor books I've read, so I enjoyed the language and difference in writing  style. Just super!	2000-06-28

Orth's  descriptions of the Cunanan's mother's pain, and her generosity to humanity  after her son's inhumane acts just touches the soul. Orth also has a method  of writing that a true crime book as if you were reading a novel, very  interesting and fast-paced. Her portrayal of how serial killers can  convince people they are not at fault for their actions is very  true-to-life. This kind of psychosis in psychopaths is common. An excellent  book, worth the bestseller list it made.	2000-06-28

This is a genre I have been reading for years. I read few other romance novels except for gothic romances, which are more mysteries where  the female heroine shows strong qualities while usually in the 1800s or  other era where women are supposed to be &quot;helpless.&quot;<br />In  &quot;Lemon In the Basket,&quot; writer Armstrong keeps up with the genre  of having troubles and secrets in the family that bubble over and often  cause death of someone in the family. But she adds twists and turns that  even surprised me. She has a terrific writing style and knows dialogue in a  manner to be commended.<br />Her switching of point-of-view was easily  understood and led the reader into interesting character insights not  usually possible even in most third-person works. <br />This is a  highly-recommended book for those who like to be kept on the edge. You  simply cannot guess what's going to happen in this book -- even though at  times it seems like you know exactly what's going to happen.<br />An excellent  study in human nature and family relationships as well.	2000-06-09

I don't like books in which readers know  throughout the whole book who the killer is, and you're just plugging  for  the main character to hurry up and get him. This surprise ending was a  GREAT shocker. How we can all invite the villain, unknowingly, into our own  homes is quite frightening... and quite realistic. And Deaver's book  describes this to a T. Great mix of police work, gruesome stuff, romance,  psychological thrills and once again (after The Bone Collector) a look into  a great detective who does it all from the &quot;comforts&quot; of home --  he's a quadriplegic!

To find out that Marilyn was a &quot;bastard&quot; child whose  mother abandoned her was astonishing. It makes you wonder what the world of  entertainment would be like had that mother aborted the child instead of  given birth to Marilyn! &quot;I was a mistake,&quot; Marilyn tells Lena.  &quot;My mother didn't want to have me.&quot; THAT's a push for pro-lifers  if I ever heard one. (And I've always been pro-choice, although I could  never personally have an abortion). Interesting in this book is that  Marilyn had a son when she was 15, and no one in Hollywood or anywhere ever  tried to track him down. Marilyn didn't want to, Lena says, because she  felt he already had his life and she didn't want to &quot;disrupt it.&quot;  Marilyn had such a low opinion of herself. She didn't see herself as  beautiful and voluptuous. She saw herself as fat. She struggled with weight  throughout her life -- in fact, Lena found herself many times having to  &quot;let out&quot; dresses so they would still fit Marilyn, who ate when  she was depressed. Marilyn Monroe fits the perfect image of the compulsive  overeater, who might have benefited from such programs as Overeaters  Anonymous, if they were around at the time.<br />Marilyn constantly told Lena  she was jealous of the poor maid's &quot;normal&quot; life, a good husband,  beautiful young children. Marilyn admitted that she got to modeling and  then acting the old-fashioned way -- prostitution. &quot;Singers, actors,  prostitutes. What's the difference? It's all rotten.&quot;<br />While Marilyn  Monroe was making so much money just being beautiful and funny in movies,  what she really wanted was to be taken seriously. She just could never get  serious roles.<br />Her political attachments to people such as Frank Sinatra  and the Kennedy boys (JFK and Bobbie) led some actors, such as Tony Curtis,  to make the comment: &quot;Kissing her was like kissing  Hitler.&quot;<br />Lena tells all, in a very fast-reading way. One interesting  note is that Marilyn liked to hang around her apartment absolutely nude.  And when she went anywhere -- she never wore a bra and panties. This led to  a hilarious remark by Marilyn about how much more shocking that famous  photo of her in a movie standing over a vent that blows her white dress up  and shows her panties would have been had she been dressed normally!  <br />Marilyn's death was a true shocker to Lena, which makes other  researchers' belief that Marilyn was murdered ring true. Lena had seen  Marilyn take her plethora of sleeping pills with alcohol, etc. Lena had  been there when Marilyn almost overdosed in a desperation to sleep. But at  the time of her death, Marilyn was happy, not having to use medication to  sleep and was going strong in her career. Anyone interested in Marilyn  Monroe should find this book, as it's priceless!	2000-05-16

Ever since I moved within an hour and a half of Lincoln County, New Mexico, where that famous jail that imprisoned Billy the Kid before his escape is now a tourist attraction, I've been enveloped by stories of this legendary killer and romantic guy. Jon Tuska adds more research and  investigation in this new book. For Billy the Kid enthusiasts who really  want to know more about the legend, the book is probably the most important  one I've read. Tuska explores the man's life and death, historical views  and fiction based on his life. One of my favorite parts is his description  of how he escaped detection by the law once when he went to a friend's  house and woke them from their bed. He got in bed with them, and they  covered him up with covers, then got back in bed as if they were alone.  When the law questioned them, it appeared they were alone! Talk about a  threesome!<br />But the best aspect of the book for historians and perhaps for  Tuska's future books on Billy the Kid is his determination that to get the  true story of what happened during the Lincoln County War, researchers need  to focus more on the actions of Alexander A. McSween and Susan Hammer  McSween and answering questions like, what happened to the Fritz  inheritance money? What happened to John H. Turnstall's numerous high  investments? Tuska's work suggests Susan McSween's financial success might  have come from extortion from the Fritz and Turnstall estate.<br />Tuska's  theories ring true, and make the reader want more. From his suggestions,  the reader almost anticipates another book from Tuska exploring these  issues. Readers should follow Tuska's career and future writings about  Billy the Kidd.	2000-05-01

Earl Mindell does a great job of doing just that! He gives his own researched description of what kinds of vitamins everyone  should be taking at all times, and then describes special treatments for  ailments from bad breath and cancer to sexually transmitted diseases and  wrinkles. He also describes the power of proteins and describes how certain  drugs deprive the body of vitamins. Caffeine is one of the biggest robbers  out there. He offers herbal help for people hooked on drugs like marijuana  and cocaine. Minerals and enzymes are explored, as well as why  carbohydrates are needed in one's diet -- and why avoiding them won't help  people lose weight.<br />Mindell's book truly puts a lot of myths and  misinformation to rest. His advice has helped me make it through a lot of  worry, illness and has answered a lot of my health questions. Keep Mindell  on hand.	2000-04-16

When  I first saw the book I &quot;had&quot; to have it because to write a true  crime book about your own child, especially an unsolved murder, and an  author of such talent, I knew it would be a wonderful -- and terrible --  book. Poor Ms. Duncan never gave up after the Albuquerque, N.M., police  told her it was a random shooting. The mother did her own digging and  learned Kaitlyn might have been involved in some Vietnamese gangs. She  turns the case to private investigators and finally to psychics, who help  her uncover what she suspected all along. This was no random shooting.  Anyone interested in how police often have tunnel vision and won't follow  up leads after they come up with their own beliefs should read this book.

In Prescription for Nutritional Healing, M.D. Balch tackles most illnesses with a description of the illness from a medical standpoint and then explains in an easy-to-read method how to treat it with decidedly  non-medical means. Herbs like echinacea for colds and as a natural  antibiotic, and supplements like zinc gluconate for colds and sinus  infections are just some of the remedies the book mentions. But obscure  illnesses many of us might suffer from, like &quot;acidosis&quot; and  little known forms of thyroid disease, plus discussion of depression and  other mental illness also are described, with supplements to help sufferers  of these. Since reading this book, echinacea extract can always be found in  my kitchen, as can vitamin C, zinc gluconate lozenges and garlic pills.  Garlic also is described as a natural antibiotic as well as having  cholesterol-lowering abilities. Whether or not readers believe these  supplements can do what he says they can (so many media and other reviews  have conflicting info), I'm convinced. I always have had allergies turn  into sinus infections, and just a few doses of echinacea extract stops it,  as do zinc lozenges. When I've gotten a full-blown sinus infection, in  which I've in past years had to go on antibiotics to cure, echinacea and  zinc lozenges have gotten me through with no drugs. Anyone with questions  about supplements and herbs and all the hype should buy this book and take  some of the doc's advice. Make up your own mind. You owe it to your health!	2000-04-16

As reviewers say, Paula has it all from &quot;acne to wrinkles.&quot; In this book, she goes from A to Z through the expensive department store and brand name products  to drugstore products -- to her own concoctions -- and tells readers what  is great or not-so-great about products on today's cosmetics market. She  has great plans for skin care for everybody's skin, including the fact that  we all should wear sunscreen every day, and exactly what ingredients must  be in the sunscreen to work right against wrinkles. Sunscreen, she reminds  all readers, is the ONLY answer to prevent wrinkles on the market. She  describes how AHAs can help reduce lines somewhat, as can prescription-only  Retin-A, but nothing can fully remove a wrinkle once it's there. For acne  sufferers, great news! Cure and prevention is there, and at low cost! I  couldn't believe how much this helped my skin. In my early thirties, I  still often suffer with breakouts. My skin is so smooth after listening to  her advice, which you won't hear from a dermatologist -- she and I can  promise you that! Now the worries about wrinkles start to come in -- but  Paula even has that covered with her news that exposure to the sun causes  them, and sunscreen can help prevent. For those who want to be tan,  regardless of the dangers of exposure to the sun and future wrinkles? She  explains which sunless tanners on the market work the best and how to apply  them. I've been using sunless tanners for years, and most people don't know  it. Also, in a segment on &quot;E&quot; with David Hasselhoff of Baywatch,  he said all the gorgeous tans people admire on the show's bods are from  sunless tanners. Paula has thought of it all, where skin is concerned,  especially the wallet. The end of her book describes which products are the  best for the money.<br />She is a star at her craft and is gaining no profit  from any of these companies. In fact, she regularly irritatesthem! Best of  all, the book describes how to get a monthly newsletter and gives an email  address where readers can ask their own questions. Answers to my questions  usually came within a few days.

While I was hoping for more of a description of Olivier's life with Vivien Leigh from his point of view, this book does a very good job of describing  Olivier's talent and how he masked himself in order to become the character  rather than trying, like many actors, to find the character's motivation  and try to relate to the character. I don't like how the book writes off  Leigh as an abusive manic-depressive who brought Olivier down in his  career. Quite insensitive.<br />The book points out how director/actor Olivier  didn't always allow his own character to outshine the others, as in Hamlet  and The Prince And The Showgirl. His cinematic technique is one to be  copied over the years -- transition in scenes, always a problem, was  carefully constructed. In Richard III, &quot;from the blood running down  the axe blade at Hastings' execution to the dripping rag used by a maid to  clean some steps, from a bell set wildly spinning by Richard as he slides  down the rope, to many bells ringing in honor of his coronation, from the  blend of blood and wine which flows from the tower down into the Thames  after the murder of Clarence to Mistress Shore placing the King's silver  wine pitcher back in its little holy niche.&quot; (p. 99). In Hamlet, he  allows the camera to become a &quot;character,&quot; as it searches for  clues in places characters don't go to. This book shows the passion Olivier  is able to give to his characters, but it didn't show Olivier's own life or  if his passion came from within. As noted by editor Warren French, the book  was not intended to get into rumor and innuendo. But the author could have  gone into quite a bit of depth about Olivier's life without rumor. Other  than this obvious omission, any film or stage fanatic should read this book  for its trueness to real talent.	2000-04-15

By  the end, it's obvious who McGinniss believes killed the doctors pregnant  wife and daughter. Also obvious is the fact that MacDonald probably  believed McGinniss' book would show his innocence.

It's a daily meditation book that goes through the  calendar year with a thought for every day and a healthy suggestion. As the  reviewer on the back cover notes, we don't need to get ulcers in order to  change our lifestyle. The book quotes such greats as Gandhi and Ralph Waldo  Emerson and then discusses a topic for each day.

I &quot;blame&quot; Vivien Leigh for the movie's success and for being so strong in my heart. Besides being the most  beautiful woman I've ever seen, Vivien's acting is so wonderful, you really  believe she IS Scarlett O'Hara. At least, she always will be for me. BUT,  little did anyone know Ms. Leigh's hidden secret -- her mental illness,  which made her success all the more enthralling. Despite bouts of  &quot;craziness&quot; and bouts of fear so great she hid in corners, Leigh  became America's sweetheart. Her portrayal of Scarlett was one of a woman  you love and hate. Folks note in the biography that after Vivien got over  one of her &quot;crazy&quot; spells, she was so kind to everyone and quick  to apologize that everyone just loved her and felt the need to protect her  all the more. This book is wonderful in its portrayal of mental illness  while describing the star's romantic life with star Laurence Olivier -- who  later leaves her because he can't handle her mental instability. This was  all before medication could have brought some dignity back to this diva's  life. Author Edwards sure did her homework in describing a true lady who  struggled to succeed while struggling for her life.	2000-04-08

When Holt writes a gothic romance, she is a master! &quot;The Secret  Woman&quot; is among my favorites. It seems heroine Anna Brett is doomed to  be a governess for a rich family in England, but she later is led through  circumstances to the captain of a ship named &quot;The Secret Woman&quot;  and its secrets, many of which are diamond in nature. She also learns about  the secret woman within herself while trusting the wrong people and  learning the hard way about evil in a friend.	2000-04-08

Covert's 12-minute approach to aerobic exercising  -- which doesn't mean just dance, it means anything that keeps your  heartrate up to a certain level for a certain amount of time -- made me  realize I didn't have to &quot;waste&quot; precious time to get in shape.  But most of all, I DIDN'T HAVE TO DIET! He explains the importance of light  weight lifting and to basically give yourself a break and accept that none  of us are going to have a perfect body. He also turned me on to jump-roping  as a cardiovascular exercise, and I still love it. Anyone concerned with  health ought to check out Covert Bailey!	2000-04-08

It definitely confirmed for me that investigation and police reporting is what I want to do. I generally agree with Ms. Buchanan's title &quot;Never Let Them See  You Cry,&quot; because in general, a woman has to be tough in this field.  But I've also discovered a softer approach can sometimes elicit just as  much information. You get really attached to police officers when you're on  the beat (even though, as Buchanan did, I constantly had to write about  them getting in trouble) and it's hard to keep objective when officers are  hurt. But reporters are human too, and Buchanan and all other reporters can  only make sure we get all sides of an issue and strive to be fair.  Buchanan's description of the gruesome and the day-to-day humdrum of a  newsroom is very well described in this book. Her descriptions of how  police departments can cover up incidents for a long time is very accurate,  as is her description of police informants to the press.	2000-04-06

As a journalist, I was already leaning toward police  coverage, but Buchanan's books really made me hunger for more. I've always  been fascinated about human evil and, as Buchanan puts it, how in humans,  &quot;the person most likely to kill you sits across the breakfast table  from you.&quot; Domestic violence is such a killer, and too often ignored  or seen as a small crime. But police officers, as Buchanan points out,  often lose their lives the most at these calls. Excellent reporting and  story-telling!	2000-04-06

The whole situation also was pure torture for David  Smith and his family. I'm sure he still reels from the shock that he could  have married someone who would do this to her own child. The writing of  this book must've been very painful for David, as is evident in the  perfectly-chosen photograph of David on the back jacket of the hardback  book. There simply is no excuse for what Susan Smith did. The book answers  questions left despite the wide media coverage after Susan finally broke  down and admitted to pushing the car in the river. &quot;Why&quot; is a  question to which no one will ever receive an acceptable answer, probably  not even Susan Smith herself.	2000-04-05

Mystery Series)	Books	4	15	16	N	N	Hilarious bloody fantasy/mystery	I'm not sure anyone would want to emulate private eye Bubba Mabry's investigative style, but journalist Steve Brewer takes a delightful look at Albuquerque, New Mexico's beauty and dark side in this thriller. Brewer  throws in a bit of the unrealistic by bringing Elvis Presley back to life  -- although he shows readers a pretty good depiction of what the King would  be like were he still alive. Several murders add enough blood for the  morbid-at-heart, and the language makes up for a somewhat shaky plot. The  characters, other than Elvis, are pretty ordinary -- the tired private eye  looking for some dough, tabloid reporters out for the story of the century,  a curvaceous Marilyn Monroe-type blonde who will either sleep with a man --  or threaten to shoot him -- in order to get information, and a couple of  hulky thugs. But the combination of all the elements makes for a fast-read  full of laughs, even in the face of horrible death.	2000-04-05

While I was at first disappointed not to have Kay Scarpetta in this delightful gruesome story, I was pleased at the entrance, from stage left, of reporter/police officer Andy Brazil. From Patricia Cornwell's descriptions, he must be a total babe. So I'm wondering, why isn't a  picture of this guy on the cover?  I loved the plot, even tho Kay could  have been involved somehow too. But the relationship between Brazil and  deputy chief Virginia West is hilarious and worth perusing. Cornwell has  done it again, except this time from the police officer's point of view. I  just think maybe Kay Scarpetta and Andy Brazil should meet in a future  book?	2000-04-02

I stumbled upon this book quite by accident and thought I'd give it a whirl. I never expected to fall in love with a character and an author quite so quickly! From the first page to the last, it's a can't-put-down book. I love the idea of having a fingerprint from a recently-executed  criminal show up at a new crime scene. And I love how they determine  throughout the whirling pace of the book how this could be possible and who  the real killer is. Great ending, superb characters and dialogue. Cornwell  is a mistress of her field and has great credentials -- having worked for a  medical investigator -- to boot! Anyone who hasn't read this book should  drop everything they're doing and read it.	2000-04-02

Always well-researched, this time the book causes Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Marino and of course, FBI Agent Benton Wesley to investigate the death of a frozen naked woman propped openly in Central Park. Their path  leads them to the parents of a psychotic serial killer, one of whom can see  nothing wrong about her son and the other parent who would only see his if  pointing a shotgun at the son's face. The woman's identity is a shock, as  is Scarpetta's handiness with a side-arm. A must-read!	2000-04-02

I must admit, I first got into Gene because I am a Scarlett  O'Hara doll fan, and &quot;Red Venus&quot; looks like Scarlett O'Hara. I  quickly acquired other dolls as my knowledge increased.

In a last-ditch effort, Page is hired by the mother  of the girl. Page has her own black past and desperately needs to find the  girl to save her falling-apart private investigation business. That, she  does, and with a vengeance. The book is confusing at times, and the amount  of characters made me almost put it down several times because I had to  keep turning back pages to remember who everybody was -- that's something  you're not supposed to have to do in a good book. I'm glad I didn't stop  reading, because I discovered Ms. La Plante to be one of the top mystery  writers I've seen after finishing this book. A prime mix of sex, blood and  glamour.	2000-04-02

I found the most entertaining part to be the way the characters interacted, and usually it's the courtroom pizazz and the plot twists and  turns with Grisham. In this book, you can see what's coming -- but it  almost makes you enjoy the book all the more because it makes you laugh at  the establishment that's getting duped, or actually participating in being  duped. Grisham could never write a bad book, and it appears in this one he  focused more on people and their frailties, greed and humanity. I loved the  scenes between our hero and the judge. AND the way the hero juror bosses  everyone around. I'm not sure too many jurors in America know the power  they really have in cases. As a police reporter, I've seen far too many  jurors be afraid of the judge and in awe of the attorneys. Too many don't  understand that they, as jurors, truly run the show and ARE the judges of  the case.	2000-04-02

I think book reviewers have to be careful when they compare authors to other authors. As a Patricia Cornwell fan, I really didn't expect this book to reach her standards, and it didn't. But with Patricia Cornwell, I'm looking for the details of the medical investigator field, not just  mystery. Wake of the Hornet is a very thrilling, edge-of-your-seat book,  although a little confusing and unbelievable as far as the plot. I wish the  author had done a little more research and made the ending a bit more  original.  Beyond that, the characters are super, especially the main  character, Nicolette Scott. The author definitely has a grasp on  depth-of-character and dialogue. This book is surely a winner and wasn't a  disappointment to me  even though it wasn't a bit like Patricia Cornwell's  expertise! I would recommend Val Davis's books and plan to read others.	2000-04-02

This typical spell-binding journey of Grisham's leads the reader to Brazil and back, on a painful crusade for main character, Patrick Lanigan, who almost gets away with stealing from his million-dollar law firm. Patrick's beautiful lover  helps him at every stage of the game as his law firm will stop at nothing  to find him and have his head -- or other parts of his body -- on a  platter. Not to mention getting their money back. Accusing the FBI of being  the ones to torture him by electric shock and other painful methods was a  brilliant decision for young Patrick. In fact, his brilliance causes him to  win against everyone, except one person...	2000-04-02

Being the morbidly curious person that I am -- one would have to be, to be a police reporter -- I found Dr. Kay Scarpetta's travels to the Body Farm, a place where dead bodies are left in various stages of decay to help  determine time of death, to be my favorite of her books! I also love all  the trouble poor Lucy always seems to get herself into. Being a hopeless  romantic, I love the sexual tension between Scarpetta and FBI agent Benton  Wesley.

Until love enters the ice princess's life, and her beloved grandfather dies. She finds she must go home and face faces of  relatives she'd rather forget in her painful memories of incest. Anne's  character is so real, as are the characters readers meet from her past and  in the present.

Side-by-side (literally!) with John Wayne Gacy. Jason Moss' journey is exactly the type of endeavor I wanted to undergo as the writer of true crime. When I jokingly told a friend of mine that I wanted to write  my next work on serial killers and that, &quot;I could probably fall in  love with a serial killer,&quot; he freaked out and told me, &quot;You have  to read this book!&quot; Moss &quot;hunts&quot; the serial killers exactly  as I would, doing research and trying to get on their level. I don't  believe in what the co-author, Jeffrey Kottler, Ph.D., says that other  people believe -- that Jason must be deranged himself. He seems to be a  risk-taker, and yes, perhaps he went a bit too far, as this terrifying  page-turner discloses. How true crime can impact journalists and other  writers mentally is very well described. The average reader might not think  about the writer's reaction. The book reminds me a bit of when I  interviewed a homeless man in journalism school in Illinois (Champaign,  Ill., my last name was Egger then). I asked him how he protected himself on  the streets. As if scratching his back, he reached behind him and pulled  out of a backpack the hugest knife I've ever seen! We were alone in a  classroom at night. Later, his family told me he had run away from facing  rape charges in New York! I could easily have been raped by this seemingly  harmless-looking person! Jason explains this kind of freaky experience in  his book as well as describing what it's like to keep an ongoing  relationship with someone you know has already killed. Great job, Jason. My  feeling is that readers will applaud his efforts that will help  psychologists and generations to come understand a bit more about the  reality of serial killers in our midst...	2000-02-06

As usual, Cornwell's characters are so real the reader feels like we know them personally. In Point of  Origin, Cornwell gives the morbidly curious her usual dose of the gross but  very real aspect of death. Most people don't think of the cutting open of  bodies as part of murder investigations, but as a writer and reporter, I  have come across medical investigators and crime myself. I have grown so  fond of her character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, that I can see her with my own  eyes. (In fact, I picture her as looking exactly like Cornwell, from her  descriptions of Scarpetta and Cornwell's own photographs and Cornwell's   experience). Scarpetta and myself savored the last moments of a dying  relationship through this book. Cornwell never gives you an ending you'd  expect. In fact, this one shocked me, and I'm pretty unshockable. Putting  emotion aside, it was the best possible ending she could have done. I think  Scarpetta would agree, although in an ironic, unhappy sense.  The book  serves up horrendous death and a lesson readers can take with them in their  own lives -- not to take anything for granted. Bravo, Cornwell!	2000-02-03

At least, nothing positive to gain from the field! She's had her share of  nasty letters from cosmetic companies that want to sell women (and men) a  lot of bunk based on sex appeal and fear of looking too old, too young, too  wrinkled, having too many blemishes, not being sexy enough ... the list  goes on! Paula offers knowledge that beauty does not come in a bottle. I  love her advice on taking care of skin. I wish I had this book when I was  in my teen years and I tortured my skin because of my acne. I've always had  acne, even into my adult years, but listening to her advice has helped  reduce breakouts. Her extensive research saves us all the trouble of trying  to find out if the &quot;fad&quot; facial cures work -- I wouldn't have  known about  AHAs and BHAs without this book, and I certainly wouldn't know  why and how to use them.
