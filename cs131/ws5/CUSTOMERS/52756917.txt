First among these is the fact that Charles, like his  great-grandfather George V, is not too bright. Unlike George V, he wants to  be seen as bright and this is what leads him into trouble. Charles's lack  of focus and desire to meddle in politics is a fault he shares with Edward  VIII--along with an overly long, dissolute bachelorhood and a penchant for  choosing the wrong woman. <br />Diana has her faults too, but to paraphrase  Jane Austen's comment about George IV, &quot;She was bad, but she would not  have become as bad as she was if he had not been infinitely  worse.&quot;<br />All the author had to do was write from record and let the  actions of the man damn him. This is what he did. Charles is his own worst  enemy.<br />Charles will be king in due time, but for the sake of the  monarchy, may Elizabeth II live a long time, may Charles gain a better  sense of what a British monarch should do before he becomes king and may  his reign be a short one.	1999-10-15

I didn't find this a story about the author as much as a story about what it's like inside the home of an English lord. I see no more straying to personal storytelling than can  be found in the books by Stephen Barry about his life as valet to Prince  Charles.<br />Is this a rose-colored view of Diana's childhood? Perhaps. I'll  allow the author the privilege of her opinion. Afterall, she was closer to  the subject than us outsiders and thus may be right.

To my delight, I found the book to be an interesting, even-handed account of the very human  foibles of two people and not a biased excuse for Prince Charles. (Well,  not quite--Benson did try that tired excuse that Diana tricked the naive  Charles into marriage, but he made only the weakest attempt at it.) For  that reason and for the interesting insight this book contains, I recommend  it. The only reason why I didn't give the book a higher rating is the few  minor factual errors that should have been caught by a good proof-reader  knowledgeable in the history of the British Royal family.	1999-09-02

Even though her parents never divorced,  Princess Charlotte was a true child of divorce. She was caught between two  adults who loathed each other. <br />Her mother, always given to excessive  familiarities and eccentricities, was starved for love and lavished it in  excess on her daughter. For all this, Caroline was unable to truly give her  daughter what she needed, when she needed it.<br />Although Charlotte  inherited her father's looks, she reminded him too much of her mother. As a  result, George IV kept her at a distance, yet he played her for a pawn and  denied her the comfort and companionship of her mother. <br />Even her  grandmother, Queen Charlotte, and her spinster aunts looked upon her with  critical eyes, finding fault in any behavior that reminded them of her  mother. It's no surprise that Princess Charlotte developed a nervous  stutter and lived down to their expectations that she'd be  a graceless  reminder of her mother. In the British royal family, one can see all social  pathologies and human foibles writ large.<br />Charlotte found happiness in  the end but died giving birth to a stillborn child. Her death set the stage  for another princess, one who would become Queen Victoria. Once more, Jean  Plaidy makes history easy to read and clear to the casual reader.	1998-12-23

According to Jane Austen, &quot;She was bad, but she would not have become as bad as she was if he (Britain's  George IV) had not been infinitely worse.&quot;<br />Jean Plaidy, a good  story-teller, does an admirable job of matching history as it was to the  story she writes. Still, she gets a few things wrong but this is due more  to lack of access to key historical documents than to sloppy research.  <br />After reading Flora Fraser's more recent, scholarly biography, The  Unruly Queen : The Life of Queen Caroline, I found Plaidy errs in  identifying the little Italian girl, Vittoria, as the daughter of Pergami  when she was his niece. She also errs in calling Pergami, &quot;Baron  Pergami,&quot; at the time he first meets Caroline. He doesn't become a  Baron until after Caroline visits Malta and buys an estate and the title of  Baron for him. Still, Jean Plaidy takes the clay of scholarly biography and  moulds a living, breathing character for the reader. <br />Caroline of  Brunswick was, at turns, warm-hearted and maternal, and defiant and  unconventional. Rejected by her husband as unfit, unkempt and  embarrassingly gauche, she became even more so as a means of getting back  at him. In the end, she only harmed herself.	1998-12-12

A study of family genealogy often explains the present-or in this case, the past. <br />In late 1700s George, Prince of Wales, was every bit the scandalous Prince Charming, the lover of older, married women that his  great-great-great nephew, the Duke of Windsor, was. George, who later  became King George IV, even tossed over his mistress, Maria (Perdita)  Robinson, in the same manner that the Duke of Windsor got rid of one of his  mistresses. He wrote her a letter and refused to take her calls. <br />In both  cases, the princes had a morally upright, dull father who never cheated on  his wife. Filial rebellion and serial adultery are long-standing traditions  in the British royal family.<br />In this book Jean Plaidy highlights the life  of Perdita Robinson, George IV's first serious fling in a life full of  flings. In it, she tells a lot about the character of George IV and sets  the stage for &quot;The Sweet Lass of Richmond&quot; and  &quot;Indiscretions of the Queen.&quot; <br />Plaidy does us all a service by  writing easy to read, entertaining novels about the British monarchy.	1998-12-12

Elizabeth II's 'annus horribilis' is not an isolated event but an on-going saga of sexual high jinx and jealousies that  have been a part of the British royal family for centuries. <br />Unlike their  German cousins, the British people have an equally long-standing tradition  of lampooning and laughing at the follies of their monarchs. Tabloid  journalism was alive and well as far back as the early days of the House of  Hanover. <br />The long-suffering Queen Caroline does her duty to the best of  her abilities-gently leading her arrogant and insecure husband, George II,  into doing the right thing in spite of himself.  But the need for a  government, independent of the whims and follies of the monarch, is by now  most evident. The evolution of power centered in the Prime Minister and  Parliament, and the ability of the British people to not take their leaders  too seriously, is the reason England ruled a mighty Empire while Germany  floundered and fell in two world wars.<br />Jean Plaidy not only has a gift  for making history easy to read, but easy to understand. This book should  be read after &quot;Queen in Waiting.&quot;	1998-11-29

Caroline of Ansbach is such a queen. Well-educated and from one  of the poorer German principalities, Caroline married into the boorish  House of Hanover. It isn't long before she discovered she's caught between  a loathsome, vindictive father-in-law, George I, and her not-too-bright and  domineering husband, the future George II. <br />The House of Hanover, newly  ascended to the English throne, would not have survived on the personal  popularity of its kings. It took the cleverness of Caroline coupled with  that of Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister, to keep things in balance.  Jean Plaidy tells the tale of the reign of George I through the personal  trauma of this most remarkable of English Queens.	1998-11-28

This book, told primarily from the male point of view, is a departure from the other books of Plaidy's Georgian Saga. Any tale of George III and his Queen, Charlotte,  could not be told otherwise because George, firmly  convinced that he should not allow any female interference in state  affairs, kept Charlotte isolated and pregnant. With incompetent advisors  such as Lords Bute and North, one can only wonder how female advice could  have been any worse. This is the tragedy of this otherwise decent and  dutiful monarch. George III is a moral exception to the Georges before him  and the George who immediately followed him. One can only regret the missed  opportunity for good that Charlotte could have brought to his  reign.<br />Plaidy, once more, takes the dull notes of history and turns them  into an interesting read.	1998-11-28

But then, this is one of the most fascinating of the romantic tragedies the British monarchy  has given to the world. This book is a damned good bodice-ripper--full of  lust, passion, jealousy and intrigue in the Court of Hanover.  Unfortunately, the beautiful princess is not rescued by her handsome lover  but is imprisoned by her loathsome husband who goes on to become King  George I of England.<br />The story of the beautiful, tragic Sophia Dorothea  is well told by this artful translator of historic biography.

Their documents were declared  by handwriting experts to be real, yet the documents were impounded by the  monarchy for another 100 years--a strange way of handing documents that  were dismissed by the courts as forgeries. Joshua Reynolds, the renowned  painter of the period, also painted a portrait of Mrs. Axford, the  Quakeress, in a style of dress not normally associated with Quakers.  Reynolds was not known to paint the portraits of persons other than the  aristocracy.  Hannah is one of the intriguing mysteries of history, but one  brought to life by the author in this easy-to-read novel.<br />Jean Plaidy  does a service to readers that writers of historical biographies seem  unable to do. She tells a good story and makes the people seem real.

Biographies of royalty tend to be stilted, heavily  burdened with the intricacies of politics and remote from the person and  character of the royal. They are not fun to read. Plaidy's novels are  fairly close to historical fact without being tediously so.<br />The Sweet  Lass of Richmond not only is fun to read, it brings to mind an interesting  parallel between George IV and his great-great-great nephew, The Duke of  Windsor. Both men were the brilliant centers of fashionable society, on bad  terms with their fathers, and both fell heedlessly in love with  unacceptable, older women. Where Wallis Simpson was a twice-divorced woman,  Maria Fitzherbert was a twice-widowed woman. Where Wallis did not mind  welcoming her prince into her bedchamber outside of marriage, devotely  Catholic Maria Fitzherbert would have nothing less than marriage before  she'd consent to give in to her prince. This drove George IV into a secret  marriage, a device that allowed him to keep his place in the succession  while enjoying the marital favors of the woman he loved. Had this marriage  been open, he not only would have been at odds with his father for marrying  without the King's consent, he would be barred from the succession for  marrying a Catholic. George IV wanted Maria, his crown and his debts paid.  George ended up choosing money and the Crown over Maria, his good wife--a  choice he regretted for the rest of his life.	1998-10-25

At first the reader is thrilled when he or she recognizes a kindred spirit  in the author, then the reader tries to apply what he or she learned. More  often than not the lessons of the book are little more than a collection of  the author's war stories. The novice writer suspects that writing is an art  form, not subject to the laws of physics. Jon Franklin says: 'No, good  short stories have form, structure and behavior patterns that can be  analyzed.'<br />The workaday world of journalism, not academia, honed  Franklin's skills. He served his apprenticeship under a quintessential  irascible old editor, G. Vern Blasdell. The young Franklin learned his  craft by squirming in his seat while awaiting the old man's verdict. Now  it's his turn to teach but he's at a disadvantage Blasdell never faced. The  reader doesn't work for him and won't oblige by twitching so much as one  butt muscle. Franklin must win the reader's attention by the pure utility  of his method. <br />Unlike most writers, Franklin has something in common  with good mathematicians. He realizes that a formula can be memorized but  if one doesn't understand the assumptions on which the formula is derived,  one can never apply the formula successfully.  This is as true in writing  as it is in mathematics. <br />Franklin builds his case for formula carefully.  He demonstrates the nature of each assumption-a complication must be  significant to the human condition; if you can't see the complication, look  for the action and work your way back to the motivation, etc. Once the  reader understands the assumptions, the formula becomes a useful tool in  the hand of the writer, not some abstract theory laid to rust in a  forgotten corner of the mind.<br />Once the reader is hooked, Franklin  introduces the outline. More than a butt muscle twitches here; the readersquirms as visions of that Roman numerated nemesis of junior high come to  mind. But this is not what Franklin has in mind. Franklin talks of a simple  three-word, five-sentence form called the conflict-resolution outline.  Character-action verb-direct object, what could be simpler? Diving in and  writing first and thinking later, but this would be less productive in the  long run. <br />The conflict-resolution outline forces the writer to think  though the elements of good story first and make sure these elements are  present before the writing begins. This method means survival for a  journalist faced with a deadline. This method insures a more satisfying and  successful writing experience for any writer. <br />Franklin teaches the 'work  smarter, not harder' principles of current business practice. The  importance of this to writers can not be understated. Ultimately, all  writing is business if one wants to be a successful writer. The writer must  produce a good product that sells itself to the editor and in turn, the  reader; otherwise the writer will be unpaid. In this book, Franklin earned  his pay.	1998-10-24

Indeed, it is the similarities between the two that makes this book a  worthwhile read. Still, this book is a weighty, scholarly tome. The author  doesn't completely drown the drama but there are times (when she uses the  stilted court English of the era) she comes perilously close to doing so.

Morton tells the tale of Diana, her remarkable  courage and  resourcefulness, and her feelings of alienation, in the face of a smear  campaign that would have shriveled us lesser mortals.

A garbage can diagnosis--he's telling me something just to keep me happy.\\" I had gone through every pamphlet on the office wall and this was the last one he had that he could hand to me. It didn't make me feel any better. I still have the sleep disorder, the chronic pain and fatigue. I have periods in which I can be semi-normal, and other periods when I'm a zombie. My employer gave up on me and my government doesn't believe I have a disability that should be covered by SSDI. Meanwhile, I suffer.<br />So, it's a relief to find a book that helps me make sense of this. I still feel rotten but I  feel more comfortable with the diagnosis, and I now have answers that may help me reclaim a more normal life. That's more than I thought possible before reading this book. This book is recommended by the Fibromyalgia Network as a good starting point and reference for those who have fibromyalgia, and for their ! families who need to know what to make of it. I agree.	1998-07-23

This is a book coming from a different direction and it centers on Cissy, the bastard daughter, more than it centers on her mother. In this sense, this is another \\"bastard\\" book. But, unlike Bastard Out of Carolina, this book literally and figuratively comes from a different direction. Mother and daughter do come to terms with each other but before this can happen, a richly varied cast of characters must pass through their lives. Not all these stories are resolved, but then, not all stories in real life can be resolved neatly within the confines of one novel either.<br />It takes a cave and a three-ring crisis to bring Cissy to the point where she grows up and understands her mother. As Cissy drags herself and her two friends through the womb of the cave to stand once more in the light, she realizes that her mother likewise dragged her out of the cave of California to stand in!  the light of the American South. It's a connection that had to be made by each woman in her own way.<br />There are flaws in this book but no more so than second novels I've read by other authors. This book is more about real women than the average bodice-ripper novel, or the trash put out by Hollywood. If you take the time to read, Cavedweller is a satisfying book, a well-crafted novel by a good story-teller.	1998-07-23

This is to be expected because neither author shares the intimacy with the Royal Circle that Lady Longford does. As a result this book focuses more on the historical events that swirled around the Royals than on the personalities of the Royals; yet by their actions, the book still tells a lot about them as individuals. <br />Both books should be read if you want to make sense of current events in the House of Windsor. Read Elizabeth Longford's book first, and this book second. Both sets of authors conclude that the House of Windsor will survive. That is to be expected of a dedicated royalist such as Longford. That Brendon and Whitehead came to the same conclusion appeared more to be a lack of nerve in the end than of reasoned conviction.	1998-06-16

It is a classic and at the risk of offending the literati among us, I'm glad Mingella is the director who will adapt this American odyssey to the silver screen. He won't bastardize it as is so often the case with books made into movies. May he succeed in getting this story through to our younger citizens the way Cameron succeeded in telling the story of the Titanic. I hope more high school juniors who are assigned this book may learn that life isn't about instant gratification and there are no guarantees of a happy ending.<br />The book is slow paced in the beginning but then time moves slower in North Carolina. I know. I lived there and walked the land and this is a book about a man's walking the land and a woman's growing to understand it.

There is a real monster in this Halloween tale, far more frightening than any conjured up in a Hollywood studio. What makes this monster even scarier is that it was conjured up by Nature in the special effects studio known as Earth's Atmosphere. It's not only real, it can happen again.<br />There are only two criticisms I have of the book. The first two chapters are a slow start but if the reader perseveres, he or she is rewarded with an unforgettable, hellish tale of the sea. The second is that us land lubbers would like to see a picture of a New England swordfishing boat. I still haven't figured out what the Andrea Gail's \\"bird\\" is.	1998-05-26

Richard Hough wrote this easy-to-read book on the six children of King George V and Queen Mary out of the notes he took for his books on the Mountbatten family. King George (and Prince Philip) was a rigid martinet who could only criticize his children so they grew up to fear him. George (and Prince Philip) adored his daughter Mary (Princess Anne) who grew up self-righteous. Queen Mary (Queen Elizabeth II) was not a warm and loving mother. She put her duty to the monarchy above her duties as a mother and neglected her children. Her eldest son Edward VIII (Prince Charles) sought love with a married woman who became a mother-figure for him, a necessary balm for his immaturities. Her son George was the Randy Andy of his era and a bisexual (Prince Edward), too. Among the Windsors, it can be said that history truly repeats itself.	1998-05-08

She tells a tale of how a war starts not from the perspective of princes, politicians and the great generals but from the mood and movements within the societies of the main combatants. We are a century, and a culture, removed from the way our great-grandparents saw life. It's difficult for us to understand how World War I came about without understanding the mind-set of the people who fought it. This, unfortunately, can make for dull reading unless enlivened by the stories of outstanding or eccentric individuals. Real history isn't always so obliging so yes, there are dull sections in this book--especially in the latter half. I applaud Ms. Tuchman's honest and honorable attempt to give us the social viewpoint of the time but I must warn you this is not a book for the casual reader who is looking for light entertainment. This is a work of scholarship.	1998-04-15

Susan attempts something new in her style that is very effective on one hand but difficult for the reader on the other. She asks \\"Who are we?\\" and then answers that there are so many strands to a story and one must trace every strand. She literally takes this idea as her form and weaves the threads of several stories together on the same page. I found each \\"thread\\" fascinating but ultimately I ended up reading each separately so that I would not lose my grasp on the story. I found Chapters 1 through 5 to be fascinating. The last chapter entitled, \\"Notes Toward A Sketch for A Work in Progress\\" is just that--an abrupt departure from the main body of the book. It's what's left over in her journal that she didn't quite fit into the book but still wanted to include anyway. It's interesting but not as engaging as the first 5 chapters. The book is gloomy and yes, Susan Griffin has a depressing outlook on life, but even doomsayers can be valuable soothsayers in our society.	1998-04-15

Ultimately theirs was a wasted life, empty of meaning in the end. From the heady days of their scandalous romance, life was all downhill, a private struggle to conserve their dignity in the aftermath of the abdication. To fill this emptiness and lack of purpose in life, the Duchess obsessed on perfection; of herself, of the things she collected and of the table she set. The Windsor's sous chef spent hours sorting salad leaves into leaves of exactly the same size to be set before their guests. Their relationship was a hollow recreation of the childhood the Duke never could leave behind. Moulin de la Tuilerie, their country home outside of Paris, was the York Cottage of Edward's youth reborn. Wallis herself was Queen Mary, obsessively arranging the display of small objets and cosseting the little boy who was King. A long time servant said, \\"They had nothing and no-one. They were just two lonely old people.\\" Suzy Menkes takes the reader on an interesting tour through not only of the tangible objects of this relationship, but of the relationship itself.	1998-03-22

It's the most cherished dream of girlhood and Wallis Warfield Simpson bought into that dream in a way that had a profound impact on the history of the British monarchy.  The story of Edward VIII and Wallis has been officially portrayed along those fairy tale lines. But it's tough to grow up and realize that fairies don't exist, and that the Windsors were Nazi sympathizers not fit to sit on the throne of England. Still, I find the truth more satisfying than the official fiction because it makes sense of history. The morganatic solution had been done before; why not in the case of Edward VIII? It makes more sense that Wallis was the excuse, not the real reason, behind the abdication. John Parker provides convincing evidence in an easy-to-read history of both the Windsors and their social set. I found it hard to put this book down.	1998-03-19

Are we any less rigid or less arrogant in our thinking than the British, French and Germans were at the start of this century? This book not only offers insight into the root causes of the first World War but some interesting thoughts about our own time.  One reader thought Barbara Tuchman was unfairly critical of Germans. I am of German ancestry and frankly, the Germans were as arrogant as she says they were. This arrogance is the same danger we Americans face now with our technology. We, too, are in danger of making the same mistakes that the Germans did. Let's hope that it doesn't take two major wars to deflate our outsized national ego. Let's hope we don't elect an insecure bully (and dumbkopf) like Kaiser Wilhelm II to be our president.	1998-03-11

The danger in media over-hype is my expectations were greater and thus my critical antennae tuned to a higher frequency than would be the case if this were a normal first encounter with a new author. Frank McCourt begins this book with prose that makes me fall in love--\\"The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve. It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges...\\" The first few pages are a feast for a lover of words, but this banquet doesn't continue beyond the first few pages. That's OK. Frank has a serious story to tell and his childhood was no bed of prose. Still I thought he lost control of his story-telling toward the end and simply got tired. The result is a book that goes down hill from a wonderful start. Do I regret reading this book? No. Do I wish the author more success in a sequel? Yes. I think he can do better and I hope he will.	1998-03-11

For me, this book is a class assignment in a writing course I am taking. Had it not been assigned, I would not have read more than a third of this book--mainly because I detest men such as Glenn Summerfield, a snake-handling preacher, sentenced to 99 years for attempting to murder his wife. I've heard so many spouse abuse excuses by fundamentalist Christian men that I doubted I could learn anything from this book that I haven't heard before. I also found the author's side exploration of his heritage to be inconclusive. There may be something real and worthwhile in his genealogical background that links him to snake-handlers but he didn't do a good job of researching and proving it. However, in the last third of this book, the author hooked me and made me feel my reading effort was not in vain. The author handed me my own viper and cleansed my soul of prejudice and intolerance toward those who follow a more emotional brand of religion than my own.	1998-03-05

We don't give thought to other worlds until something strange happens--the murder of Versace or the death of Princess Diana. This book lifts up the rug on these two worlds and allows us to glimpse at something quite alien from our own. Beneath the upper crust of society there is a social dictum that allows the rich and the well-connected to be \\"doing it and excusing it\\" as long as it's done with discretion. Behind the facade of certain marriages are gay people in hiding--arranged marriages of convenience. It is a social hypocrisy that didn't start with the Edwardian era but it certainly continues through today.   Billed as a double bio, this book is more the biography of Violet Trefusis, lesbian daughter of Alice Keppel, King Edward VII's mistress and the great-grandmother of Camilla Parker-Bowles. But to tell the story of Violet, one must understand Alice and the Edwardian social set. This story is a tour through strange worlds indeed, richly told with text from the letters and published works of the main characters. This is biography that gives you the pathos of real people.    Diana Souhami tries to balance the scales by telling the story of the famous lesbian affair between Vita Sackville-West and Violet Trefusis from Violet's point of view. One feels sorry for Violet but also annoyed. How long does it take for Violet to accept that Vita isn't willing to commit to their relationship? Violet, the victim, is a self-deceiving at best, dense at worst. Violet hasn't inherited her mother's ability to make the best of whatever social situation she's in. That's the ultimate tragedy of it. The hypocrisy of society will be with us forever. Only the strong learn to use it to their advantage. It's a lesson we all learn, whatever our place in this world.	1998-03-02

This is clearly Prince Charles before the fall, when his sense of duty and youthful promise shown clear. It's also the official line--Gordonstoun before Prince Charles admits how much he loathed the place, and Prince Philip before his browbeating of his son became common knowledge. It's also the pre-Camilla Charles, planning to live at Chevening, an estate southeast of London, willed to the royal family by Lord Stanhope. The fact that he later changes his mind and purchases Highgrove, a less desirable and less convenient estate farther to the west of London shows how much his marriage was a sham from the start. Highgrove's only virtue over Chevening was its proximity to Camilla Parker-Bowles. Still this book is an interesting view of what was once upon a time a prince with shining promise. Now he's an older human being with faults for which I hope he's the wiser.	1998-02-23

I couldn't understand how the father, an aeronautical engineer, could be a child support dead beat. Geoffrey Wolff answers that question. Where &quot;This Boy's Life&quot; is a lesson in &quot;never underestimate the charity of women&quot;, &quot;The Duke of Deception&quot; is a lesson in &quot;never underestimate the gullibility of merchants, landlords, car dealers, bankers and employers.&quot; The father is a Great Pretender, brilliant and charming enough to invent credentials that get him jobs and credit for which he is not qualified. He pulls this scam off not once but many times during a 25-year period in which he and his eldest son live on the run. Geoffrey Wolff explores his love-hate relationship with this man and gives us insight into a type that, in its less gifted state, fills our prisons. It's a testament to the resiliency of children that both Wolff brothers survived their childhood to become productive citizens. The key to Geoffrey Wolff's survival can be seen in a comparison of his writing style with that of his brother. Geoffrey keeps a reader at arm's length where Tobias allows the reader to slip into his skin.	1998-02-21

These choices leave her son adrift, confused and rebellious, unsure of where he belongs. He sets out to be a wise guy; a tough masking the uncertainty he feels. His stepfather, Dwight, masking his own demons and insecurities, also sets out on a mission--to drive Toby (alias Jack) down to his level. It's to Toby/Jack's credit that he doesn't want to stay down and that's enough of an edge. Instinctively using the creative license of his absent father, he finds a tenuous way out--enough of a break to set him on a better path. Most boys in this situation don't make it. I know. My brother didn't make it. This story is an honest picture of the lives of too many divorced women and their children. (I also recommend you read Geoffrey Wolff's \\"The Duke of Deception\\" for the other half of this family saga.)	1998-02-21

Having oneself as a topic is the easiest assignment, the perfect ice-breaker to help  overcome first time jitters. The same can be said of the memoir.  First time writers often don't know where, or how, to begin. As with all good teachers--Lou Willett Stanek gives the student/reader permission to begin. She eases the would-be writer through self-doubt. She explains the difference between autobiography and memoir. She gives the new writer a way to begin by writing a memoir. This book is a good place to start learning the joy of writing.	1998-02-16

My son-in-law thought this book was the &quot;cat's meow&quot;--the answer to all his marital problems so he strongly recommended that I read this book. I tried, but I couldn't get more than a 1/3 of the way through. Usually I can read anything but this was an unhappy exception.   I looked at the cover and saw Ph.D. after the author's name and thought, you got to be kidding. This book wouldn't pass Freshman English with a C-grade, much less Introductory Psychology! Then I found out that the author is not licensed to practice what he preaches and he got his Ph. D. degree through a mail-order diploma mill. I'm surprised he got this thing published with such shaky credentials.  It's really scary to see that he's been on the Best Seller list and is writing more of this trash.   By the way, the book did not save my son-in-law's marriage. My step-daughter wisely gave him, and this book, the heave-ho. I recommend that you do the same.	1998-02-15
