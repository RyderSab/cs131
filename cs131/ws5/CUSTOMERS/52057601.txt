For example, he includes a fascinating discussion using religion as a jumping-off point for resolving post-modernism's overly relativistic thinking. Edmundson focuses on deep questions for readers - what does your reaction to a book say about you? Why do you like a character and how does he/she reflect you?   <br /> <br />I did find large portions of this book inaccessible--I haven't read Derrida, I am not particularly well versed in Shakespeare. I suppose I read mainly for pleasure and only partly for deep personal reflection. Edmundson would probably say--and rightly so--that this is because I am certainly a participatant/victim of the consumerism of the liberal arts education! And maybe that is one of his most important points. In any case, this was a stimulating read but it may make some readers feel intellectually inadequate.	2005-06-09

Not because the math described is particularly complicated (it is most definitely not...high school algebra is sufficient), but because Ross' writing style is too verbose. 99% of readers should know the meaning of \\"average,\\" yet Ross devotes a lot of text to explaining this concept. I'm not sure who his audience is. Math-savvy people may feel that concepts have been dumbed-down and over explained, but math-phobic people may be scared off by the use of formulas...and the majority of times they aren't really needed anway.	2005-05-15

I'm enjoy Fresh Air and just wanted to make a few quick comments for other frequent listeners. PRO: If it's hard for you to devote 100% attention to the radio broadcast, you may enjoy having a bit more time to focus on the content. CON: as a frequent listener you probably recall much of what's here and won't have many A-Ha moments. Finally, these interviews are art/music/acting focused; this book does not include any of Ms Gross' interviews with current-events or political figures.

The main topic here--having a premature baby--is familiar to many families. Yet Leary's writing style is so transparent, so direct, that the reader is just captivated. This is not a long book, not a technical or complicated book, and certainly not a gossipy book (even though she is married to a celebrity). It's just a wonderful and personal story. To be way more trite than she ever would be: you will laugh, you will cry, you will feel like you know her. <br /> <br />Here's an excerpt:  <br />My mother does the Times crossword puzzle every day. On Mondays she can do the puzzle in ten minutes...by Saturday she sits surrounded by dictionaries and encyclopedias and solves the puzzle with the single-minded determination of a scientist unraveling the mysteries of DNA. On weekdays there's nobody around to admire her acuity with the English language, so on Sundays, when her husband and, often, one or more of her children are present, she tries to turn what should be a solitary diversion into a one-woman performance piece designed to showcase her superior intellect.  <br />   She usually waits until we're all seated in the family room reading the Sunday papers, and then she innocently settles herself into her favorite armchair. She works quietly for a few moments, then sighs and says, to no one in particular, \\"I'm having the hardest time with today's puzzle.\\" In response we all shake our papers and squint fiercely at the pages, trying to convey the seriousness of our reading and the imperviousness of our concentration. This is lost on my mother, who then scans the room looking for her first victim... <br />   And so she continued throughout the day, until the puzzle was done and the entire family was suitably demoralized by the fresh evidence of our staggering stupidity. <br /> <br />Enjoy.	2005-05-04
US	52057601	R2HBCY9RGH2Y0R	1573222925	26397166	Breaking Ground	Books	3	5	9	N	N	Autobiography + justification	Daniel Libeskind writes a pretty good autobiography and \\"speaking my mind\\" piece. This is NOT a technical book. Some of his discussions regarding the art in architecture are interesting conceptually. But through the autobiography and beyond, he offers thinly veiled justification for why he deserved to win the WTC commission. For example, during the WTC competition, some critics complained that his wearing a US Flag lapel pin was contrived. Libeskind is careful to include, in his pre 9/11 commentary, comments about how he was wearing his lapel pin at this or that function. He also goes to great length to establish himself as an American and a New Yorker (presumably because critics have complained about this as well). Maybe he's insecure, maybe just not sophisticated enough to know better. In any case it's part of his personality...and getting to know someone is part of what most people seek when reading an autobiography. So it's not entirely objectionable. <br /> <br />Following his receiving the WTC commission he entered into a \\"forced marriage\\" with David Childs and the SOM firm as the developers. Libeskind doesn't mince words describing his dislike for Childs and SOM and offers absolutely nothing positive on Childs and SOM. For this reason, the reader really must hear the Childs/SOM point of view (or at least consult a more neutral source) before coming to an opinion on the current Freedom Tower development.  <br /> <br />That said, it's a nice quick read and does offer an interesting look at one of our generation's foremost architects.	2005-04-26

It's ironic in that while the effects of this might seem undesirable or even embarrassing, we the public are merely getting what we ask for...we're just consumers. Then Twitchell explains why, in some cases, the effects of this branding are not undesirable after all.  <br /> <br />The most insightful section of the book covers the branded-ness of higher education (appropriately so, since Twitchell is himself a professor). Twitchell describes American higher eduction choices as a barbell, with elite colleges such as Harvard on one end and \\"convenience\\" colleges (think Wal-Mart) on the other end, with the institutions in the middle feeling the real squeeze to differentiate themselves. Also included is an interesting look at the US News & World Report college list phenomenon as well as a look at why convenience colleges might not be as bad as you think. Twitchell even includes some practical insight on where college dollars might be best spent. <br /> <br />I found the megachurch section to be only so-so. Perhaps because I am very familiar with megachurches I found many of his points to be pretty boring. (Guess what - megachurches have modern sounding music!?) The section on Willow Creek finding its marketing niche (men) was interesting, however. If you are reading this book primarily to learn about megachurches I might recommend The Transformation of American Religion by Alan Wolfe instead. It is a bit more scientific and objective in its study. <br /> <br />Twtichell's writing style is a bit odd...not bad, but just a little different. At times he does ramble a bit but then suddenly includes a dense and insightful sentence. This style kept my interest but made the book a careful, not quick, read. Also important is the reader's willingness to buy into the definition of \\"brand\\" as STORY. This may be a mental jump for some.  <br /> <br />In short, this isan enjoyable book. You won't look at college, church, or museums in the same way.	2005-04-21

I read this book, prayerfully considered it, did my research and thankfully moved on to other approaches. I have two kids who are great sleepers, great eaters, and are hopefully on their way to being spiritually mature. <br /> <br />Gary Ezzo has been discredited by well-resepected Christian leaders, pediatricians, and parents. (see link on [...] for several references including a particularly good one by the Christian Resource Institute) <br /> <br />Yes, this book does make valid points, but the tone and underlying message is \\"if you don't do things THIS way, you are sinning and your kids will turn out bad.\\" And vice versa. Hey--No author, Christian or otherwise, can make these types of guarantees!! Every child is different, every parent is different. There are exceptions to every rule out there. Yes, God is the same and scripture is always the same, but as sinful people we cannot ever predict the future nor predict the exact results of our actions...let alone anyone else's. <br /> <br />Furthermore, many Babywise imperatives have zero (or out-of-context) Biblical backing. For example, Ezzo says that God would condone letting a child cry because, after all, even God the Father did not answer His son's cry on the cross. As the CRI states, \\"We see no way to make such an application of this verse without completely disregarding its original context and purpose.\\" It is truly dangerous to provide out of context Scripture. After all, many Christians will read this book, note the Christian source, and not check references. Please don't be one of those! <br /> <br />If you do read this book, pray about it and please do some research on Ezzo. Just because an author quotes Scripture does not mean he/she is speaking God's truth.	2005-04-19

First off, I am a lay reader who, prior to reading this book, was on the fence regarding genetically modified (GM) food. I had heard some scary stuff from friends and in the media but I wanted more information. After reading this book I feel reasonably well versed in GM history/opinion/issues, although as other reviewers noted, this book is definitely biased in favor of GM. To have a truly informed opinion a person ought to also read an anti GM book. That said, here are my key learnings: <br /> <br />(1) If a person chooses to be anti GM, in order to be consistent then there are many more foods to avoid than you might think. The definition of GM is subject to wide interpretation. Truly being opposed to any messing around with a plant's DNA would mean that you should not consume Canola, Tritricale, the majority of domestic Soy and Corn, and a LOT (!!) of other foods including many foods featured in your local health food store.  <br /> <br />(2) As noted above the definition of GM is nebulous. Where is the line between the generally accepted cross-breeding of plants (think Luther Burbank) and the \\"scary\\" genetic modification done in a lab under a more controlled setting?  <br /> <br />(3) The media has generated a lot of anti GM buzz and fear. Actually looking at the facts is, as usual, a lot more complicated. It takes some heavy reading, through a book such as this one, to be able to interpret the science for oneself. Most people are more content to read a quick article in a magazine and then end up with a much less informed (and probably anti GM) opinion. <br /> <br />(4) There are undeniable benefits of GM. Less chemical pesticide needs to be applied to some GM crops. GM can introduce additional nutrients to foods. GM has saved some plant species from going extinct.  These and other benefits must be weighed against any downsides of GM.  <br /> <br />This book also includes an interesting discussion on Organic foods, in particular debunking the public's tendency toromanticize organic farming.  Think Organic is Farmer Jed working a small farm with his own hands?  That's what the marketers want you to believe...  <br /> <br />In conclusion I recommend this book to anyone who wants to formulate an opinion on GM and is willing to work through the science and history thereof. Even if you happily anti GM, this book is worth reading so that you can be informed about the other side. As for myself, after reading through the facts, I'm OK with feeding GM foods to myself and my family.	2005-04-08

I am writing this review specifically for parents who are already using Jolly Phonics (which I highly recommend...with a few reservations though). I had hoped that Teach Your Child To Read  would be a good complement to Jolly Phonics since Jolly Phonics does not come with much instructional text for the parent/teacher. Teach Your Child To Read...  is well written and full of good information. Furthermore, there are no real conflicts with teaching techniques between the two, but I just found nothing in this book to add to what we are already doing with Jolly Phonics. <br /> <br />It seems to me that Teach Your Child To Read is a good one-stop shop for those parents who may or may not have a lot of experience in teaching a child to read. It is quite scripted for the parent/teacher. It is not as good for the parent looking for some creative supplementary material.	2005-03-24

However, as a general reader, I found this book to have good basic information.  It was easy to read, not at all too technical for the non medically trained person.

As other reviewers mentioned, I might have been more willing to focus on the science if I had understood WHY the technical facts were important to the author's arguments.  I felt that after reading the introduction and first chapter, I understood Goodstein's argument as well as his reliance on Hubbert's thesis.  But beyond that, I didn't really gain much other than learning that all alternatives to oil are either nearly depleted, not practical, or could (literally!) spell the end of life on this planet. <br /> <br />Reading the book did cause me to stop and think about our reliance on oil, so in this regard, Goodstein achieves one of his goals.  Unfortunately, however, I feel worried and guilty without any sense of motivation to do anything.  I was left with the depressing outlook of a doomed planet where any personal conservation efforts are futile.  In short, I don't recommend this book to the lay reader.  There has got to be a better book out there.	2005-01-26

Readers who previously enjoyed books such as The Hot Zone should find this particularly appealing.  The book alternates between descriptions of battling real epidemics and describing the people who do this battle.  The book leaves the reader feeling grateful to those who do this challenging, tedious, and dangerous work...and also frightened to learn the \\"real deal\\" on how epidemics spread.  I found the chapter on vaccines to be particularly interesting, and I appreciated the global view of disease, which allows the reader a glimpse into the vast differences in healthcare between the developed and less-developed parts of the world.	2004-12-22

Perhaps readers who work with language-challenged children would find this book more beneficial. <br /> <br />The author seeks to help parents model and teach language skills to their children.  However, many of the recommendations seemed to almost make fun of parents who struggle with communicating with their children.  I thought a more supportive tone would help achieve the author's goals, especially since (as she goes to great lengths to explain) parents do not always do a good job of listening and speaking appropriately to their children.  I also found the author relied overly on anecdotal situations.  Often the text referred to past anecdotes without a reminder of the context; this left me feeling lost on more than one occasion. <br /> <br />But as I mentioned previously, this book did steer me toward Jolly Phonics, which has provided exactly the tools I sought to help me guide my toddler into the world of phonics, reading, and writing.	2004-12-22

But what I appreciated most was the author's calm and reassuring tone.  The book lives up to its subtitle, An Optimistic Guide to Understanding and Healing.  Although Lucas describes admittedly alarming situations in detail, he does not sensationalize the disease.  Instead he presents a very human side of both the victims and the loved ones (usually the parents).  <br /> <br />I found that Demystifying Anorexia Nervosa is an excellent complement to Ellyn Satter's books about children's eating and the \\"division of responsibility\\" idea.  Lucas, like Satter, place great importance on respecting the individual and the individual's desire to make decisions for him/herself.  (For those who have not read Satter's books, they describe how to have the right feeding relationship with your child, and also offer excellent practical advice on feeding babies through school age children.)	2004-12-22

When Conley described how he wanted his book to be different from every other &quot;birth order&quot; book out there, and would use lots of statistical studies to back up his points, I was totally hooked!<br />Unfortunately the book just didn't amount to much.  The author gives lots of anecdotes and statistics, but never manages to draw any conclusions more interesting than (1) only children and oldest children have the greatest chance for success (2) youngest children have the next greatest chance for success.  Now, this is reasonably intriguing, but it only takes Conley a couple chapters to make this point.  Beyond that, all the chapters are totally inconclusive.  He deliberately includes an anecdote to show &quot;a&quot;, followed by another anecdote showing &quot;not a.&quot;  After while this is pretty tiresome to read.  I suppose if the reader had bought into every pop theory out there, Conley's book might serve as a good counterpoint, but otherwise it is disappointing.	2004-07-01

It was very readable and well written.  I appreciated how the viewpoints and examples used were neutral and usable regardless of the reader's perspective on any issue.  <br />Some of the more interesting points were: (1) an explanation of the pressure to conform, and why this pressure is surprisingly high even among those who consider themselves independent thinkers (2) the power of being first to speak in a group and the efficacy of a firm and confident tone (3) the two types of dissenters: contrarians and disclosers; and the importance of disclosing one's opinion and reasoning (4) discussion of &quot;groupthink&quot; and how group opinions form based on the group's members.<br />I appreciated Sunstein's frequent reference to psychological studies.

I got the feeling that Rabb himself was more interested in the plot than the characters.  That said, the plot is fascinating and believable.  There are a few plot twists that completely surprised me, so overall it was an enjoyable book to read.  The writing and editing were unobtrusive.

I happen to be a &quot;believer&quot; in one of the analyzed faiths (Protestantism--both mainline and evangelical, Catholicism, and Judiasm) and I found his analysis to be insightful, occasionallly disturbing, amd very thought-provoking.  Although Wolfe calls himself an agnostic, of sorts, he is respectful to the people and views he analyzes and uses an even handed tone to both praise and critique the current state of religious belief in the US.  <br />As a person interested in theology I found his discussion of modern doctrine, sin, and worship to be completely fascinating.  This book does not set out to change anyone's core beliefs about God, but it very well may change your view about how the church approaches God, worship, and evangelism.<br />Although I am a lay reader, I have read quite a bit of theology and was comfortable with some terms that Wolfe takes a bit for granted.  A person who has trouble distinguishing between the terms &quot;evangelical&quot; and &quot;mainline&quot;, or thinks that a church using rock music might be called &quot;liberal&quot; could have difficulty with the text.  Wolfe could have included a short glossary at the end of his book; this may have made this important text more accessible to lay readers.  <br />I strongly recommend this book to any person studying religion or theology, or to any intellectually-minded believer in Christianity or Judaism.	2004-05-03

Prior to reading it I had never heard of him, or mediachannel.org.  That said, I found this book very thought provoking and I don't watch the news in the same way anymore.  Schechter provides important questions for a news consumer to ask, and makes even a casual news watcher more critical of any inherent bias in the media.  <br />Perhaps because Schechter would call me a victim of American media, I found some of his Middle East commentary difficult to follow.  I am probably not educated on those topics enough.  Instead, I most appreciated the critiques of domestic 9/11 coverage.  I also thought that at times the book seemed to be overly &quot;selling&quot; the author's website (mediachannel.org).  After reading the book, I can appreciate why he is trying to popularize the site, but I thought there were just too many mentions of the site...it got in the way of what may have been more salient points.  The book seemed a little long, toward the end.<br />In a weird tangental way, this book is an interesting partner with Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine, as it asks many touchy questions regarding the media's role in US culture.<br />In the end...it's worthwhile reading regardless of your political views, as long as you don't mind taking a critical eye toward the media.	2004-03-03

Boy was I wrong!  This book tells an absolutely fascinating story about a pioneer woman and her husband who participate in the gold and silver rush.  They travel from Maine, through Kansas, and end up in Colorado.  The character development is top notch, although I did feel that the author displayed quite a bit of bias toward the heroine, and an equal bias against her husband...but that is worth overlooking in the greater scheme of the book.  I think the husband would have told the story differently, but then again this book is from the perspective of the wife!  <br />I didn't realize the book was based on true events and real people until I finished it, and now I am haunted by their story and their lives.  It is inspiring, because of the heroine's independence and hard working attitude, and thought-provoking, because of the personal costs to the main characters.  Even though the events took place well over 100 years ago I thought the characters still have a lot of relevance to life today.	2004-01-26

I found the Flatland references appealing, but readers who have not read Flatland may find this book difficult to enjoy.  On the other hand, serious Flatland students might find this too lighthearted.<br />At times Rucker over-explains the science; at times he under-explains the science; and sometimes he makes significant plot twists without enough context.  That said, this is a very creative story.  The silicon valley references, and its characters, are amusing.  I also appreciated Rucker's sketches sprinkled throughout the book.<br />I think this book would be most appealing to casual Flatland readers looking for a light, humorous read.	2003-11-21

This is frustrating and gets in the way of enjoying the story.  An example: (p.14)<br />The ganglet of ninlocos arrived before the food did.  They swaggered in past the protesting door, the lanky chieflado in the lead spizzing it with a spinner whose ident was torqued to reflect instead of inform.  Behind the chingaroon ambulated a group of negs and poses, though which was who and who was witch [sic] was hard to say at first glance.<br />In fact, he includes a glossary at the end of the book.  I didn't realize it was even there until I finished the book, but even had I known, it would have been too cumbersome to flip to the back every time I read a made-up term.<br />I also wondered why the story delves into futuristic ideas that aren't relevant to the plot.  Perhaps this appeals to devoted sci-fi readers (I'm not one of them) but I couldn't see why he set the story so far in the future when the key technology could believably exist sooner.   This would have saved quite a bit of explanations of inventions, concepts, gadgetry, etc.<br />I also found the ending to be pretty weak...I won't explain why since that would ruin it for others, but I thought the original and creative storyline deserved better.<br />Great idea for a story, and very unique plot twists.  May be worth a quick read if you can look past (or enjoy) the jargon.	2003-10-29

At a superficial level, the writing is clear and sophisticated and the story tries to be a real portrait of modern thought developing in the early 20th century.  But I wonder how much of that is just taking today's socially liberal thinking and misapplying it to that period of time.  <br />I also found the author's parallels between the main character (Emily) and Perpetua to be disappointing.  From the middle of the book I started hoping the book would not end as predictably as it did.  I also found the Emily/Perpetua storyline to be a slam on motherhood.  Miller tries to couch this in respect, and explain how &quot;everyone's different and finds their passions in different things&quot; but I felt there was not enough effort expended by Emily (and ESPECIALLY by her friend Olive) to justify her actions.  As a mother myself I felt sorry for the characters, when Miller seems to be trying to glorify their choices.<br />So this is a thought provoking book, which is good, but I feel that the characters and the storyline did not adequately support the message Miller tries to convey.  That, combined with the utterly predictable plot, makes me give it only 2 stars.	2003-10-24

Although I am not really into the sci fi genre I found a lot to enjoy.  The writing was clever and pithy and the futuristic conventions were extremely interesting.  I liked how he didn't go on and on explaining some of the futurist concepts but just let the context clarify what he means.  (A society that has no money, just &quot;Whuffie,&quot; an instantly readable rating of a person's credibility.  Creative and thought provoking).  <br />By the way, if you enjoyed the Walt Disney World and humor aspects of this book you might also enjoy Deep Water by SV Date.	2003-10-24

The characters make the book - well developed, interesting, and pleasantly DIFFERENT!! from all the other mystery characters out there.  Excellent plot twists.  Very enjoyable and a commendable debut for PJ Tracy.  (If you are worried that co-authored books are generally mediocre...don't.  This one is an exception!!)	2003-09-24

The writing was kind of elementary: short sentences, basic storyline, somewhat one dimensional characters, a few plot twists...likeable but not terribly sophisticated.  That said, I did read it straight through in one sitting and enjoyed it overall.  The editing was a bit messy; &quot;desert&quot; instead of &quot;dessert,&quot; etc.	2003-09-24

Pryor's sentences are awesome--full of creative metaphor and unique use of language.  The problem was that after while, all the great sentences, one after another, started to seem long and stilted.  Don't get me wrong, there are some well-thought plot twists and pretty hilarious characters (a transsexual assassin working for Saddam Hussein!?), but unfortunately the writing style gets in the way of plot and character development.  I found myself skimming the paragraphs trying to get the gist of the plot and move on.  This is too bad, because some of those passages were probably worth reading.  Too much of a good thing, maybe?	2003-09-12

The plot and its various turns *were* unbelievable, but the subtle and overt jokes are so funny.  I guess I didn't expect something real...and the storyline is so quick that you don't spend a lot of time needing to believe it.  Date's humor and satire is right on.  Very entertaining!!	2003-09-02

This is probably justified based on her topic, but I am a happy and experienced home cook and I really enjoyed the book too.  She explains useful tips for adapting foods for little eaters and how to round out meals with appealing vegetables and desserts.  I love this book!  A great companion to Child Of Mine: Feeding with Love and Good Sense, because it provides lots of recipes to help apply the very sensible eating principles from Child Of Mine.	2003-08-26

The other reviews were pretty accurate, the one thing I will add is there is quite a bit of British humor...non-Brits might not get all the jokes!  But don't let this put you off, the book is very amusing and has a couple of clever plot twists too.	2003-08-25

The book is so action packed, the character development takes a backseat anyway.  <br />The author does a great job of developing an interesting plot in different locales, bringing in characters you love and hate, and coming to an exciting conclusion.  Definitely a great escape read.	2003-08-25

The dialogue (especially between the protagonist and his boss) is clever and smart.  If you like words and wordplay this is a great mystery.  Some of the Britishisms might be lost on Americans, but it is not a big problem at all.	2003-08-25

I absolutely couldn't put it down.  The story flies along and the plot turns are so very interesting!  Mankell really knows how to tell a mystery story; some details are important, others aren't, so that the reader is truly guessing the whole time.  New twists and events pop up so quickly that (as I already said) it's hard to stop reading!<br />The protagonist is a complex, intriguing, drinks a lot of coffee, mixes big-deal police incidents with getting his car fixed, etc. so that he seems very real.  <br />My only complaint, and maybe this is just Mankell's style, is that here we have a plot zipping along at a fast pace, and then you all of a sudden you're through the climax and the book's over.  The End.  Maybe I'm too accustomed to the Hollywood crescendo but the climax really caught me by surprise, left me saying &quot;that's it?&quot;  Plot-wise it was pleasantly satisfying, wrapping up what needed to be, and was clever enough, lengthy denoument even, but it just could have used some extra buildup or suspense right at the end.<br />Other than that...this is the best book I've read in awhile.  Interesting, suspenseful, great techno thriller plot, complex characters.  If you're looking for a new author here's one to try.	2003-08-25

But it's no Tom Clancy	This book had a lot of action and reminded me of your average military type thriller movie.  The author starts off trying to portray the Algerians objectively but quickly falls into using the middle eastern stereotype.  I guess it works OK for this book but I found it a little predictable and definintely un-original.  If you're interested in the Blue Angels you'll definitely enjoy this book, some of the flying scenes are cool.  Otherwise, it's OK...not the best ever but reasonably entertaining.	2003-08-21

It was so jumpy, so terse, so &quot;left unsaid&quot; that I felt like the author was trying too hard to make me think.  (She would probably be a very good poet!)  The storyline involving her son Paulie was the most compelling part of the book, in my opinion, but I thought there was not enough written about this subplot.  The writing was clearly well-thought, and there were some very funny and witty passages, but I guess the book seemed too disjointed for me to rate it higher.	2003-08-21

The plot was clever, the characters interesting, and the action moved quickly.  The two drawbacks of this book were that there was some over-the-top violence that seemed a unnecessarily detailed, and some of the high-tech details of the plot were pretty farfetched.  But it was definitely a fun read!	2003-08-21

The action moved along at a good pace.  There were some clever plot twists I enjoyed.  However some of the romance scenes were almost laughably written.  But I'm not a romance genre reader so maybe that's why I found them a little strange.  I also found some of the mysticism a little out of place, but that's also not a topic I am interested in.  All in all this was reasonably entertaining.	2003-08-21

The writing is terrific and the main character is disturbingly well described.  However, I had a hard time finishing this book...I guess I didn't find the plot very compelling.  Or maybe I wasn't reading closely enough because there were a couple of plot turns that left me scratching my head.  This is not a book to zip through.  But the writing is superb.	2003-08-21

But in between those sequences, the dialogue and the plot get a bit weighted down.  I thought that some of the characters were interesting, but others lacked motivation.  The action kept the plot moving, but there were some big holes in the storyline as well.  Overall the book reminded me a lot of Dean Koontz, so fans of his might enjoy this book.	2003-08-20
US	52057601	R3RQGWJYTEZQGM	0871138514	31143968	Badger Games	Books	2	1	6	N	N	Not very compelling and kind of confusing too	This is the first book I've read by Jon Jackson.  I think there are other books with the same protagonists, and maybe if I'd read those first I would have liked this book better.  I did not find the protagonists interesting at all. In fact, I found the villain--even though I think the author tried very hard to make him unlikeable--to be a more interesting and even occasionally compelling character.  The plot had some trouble too...either I wasn't reading carefully enough, or there were some major unanswered questions about the motives of several characters.  Last of all the author tended to use various names to refer to the same character (e.g. sometimes calling a person by his last name, sometimes his first, sometimes a title) and I thought this was a bit confusing since there are a lot of characters involved in the story.<br />To summarize...this book was entertaining enough to finish, but mostly I was glad when it ended so I could start another book.	2003-08-20
