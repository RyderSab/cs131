Anti artist artists were born something out of a reaction to English public opinion against Byron and Shelley and their questionable views and lifestyles. Their motive is to knock high ideals off their perspective horses. While Europe was taking art seriously, maybe too seriously, with rebellious Wagnerian operas and psychological probings of Flauberts and Prousts and such the English were being amused by Gilbert and Sullivan and other entertainment of high silliness. There is a method to the madness of Wodehouse and that is to knock down  any art that takes itself too seriously.<br /><br />Wodehouse can draw one sophmoric prank out into a mini novel which at time can be tedious and at times masterful. In the end not much is really said here or is it?	2005-01-10

It is a wonder if someone of her nature could ever be happy with what the real world could offer. Her brief moments of happiness are gained in dreams and fantasy, or tempting/dreaming the impossible, the forbidden fruit. The real world, despite living a life of relative privilege, was a never ending experience of pain to her. She took seeing the ephemeral (wabi sabi/mono no aware) aspects of life to heiights of seeing the eternal in the ephemeral the great in the small, which can be beautiful (as with Basho), but Lady Sharshina seems too idealistic and self obsessed which makes it something pitiful in the end. The real world is one of duty and lament: \\"veni, vedi, vici\\" would not be her epitaph; more like perpetual nostaligic anguish and shyness. Her regrets seem misguided.<br /><br />Lady Sharashina avoided popular attractions, as opposed to her near contemporary Sei Shonagon, in \\"The Pillow Book\\", who endeavored to be the attraction. Some of the scenes are unforgetable and the book is a classic for what it is: the memoirs of a dreamer. The book has one of the most poignent poetic conundrum sort of endings I can recall.<br /><br />The translation failed to capture all of the poems, which is to be expected; but those that were captured are brilliant.<br /><br />The contrast between Sei Shonagon and Lady Sharshina is one of the beauties of these books and poses an interesting psychological comparison.	2004-06-04

Hafiz was a main influence on the third and final stage of Goethe's writing and ideas. When you find that one thing you better go after it with a passion like your hair is on fire. They also demonstrate the diversity of thought in the Persian influenced area of the world.<br /><br />Of course something is lost in translation with most all poetry, one sees only a single frame of a changing kaleidoscope.

In the end I didn't see much difference with Oberman's own accounts of the critical forces driving the times or in Oberman's approach as differing from Gilson's, he just calls movements by other terms, gives names like \\"hedge waters\\" or \\"Forerunners\\" for precursor movements, and so forth, as opposed to Gilson's thesis/antithesis.../synthesis. In fact Oberman's scholarly placement of Luther in the nominalist camp only broadens Gilson's conclusions and Gilson's given emphasis on Occam as a driving beacon of the times over Luther and justifying Luther's near absence in Gilson's book \\"The Unity of the Philosophical Experience\\".<br /><br />Dr. Oberman also emphasizes the Capernican revolution. Gilson put more focus on Descartes and Occam, among others, in this regard. Then Joseph Campbell placed more emphasis on the discovery of the new world as being a main influence for a  crisis of faith and shifting public consciousness to a new devotion in science.<br /><br />Oberman's interpretation of the acceptance of a more action oriented exegise and the idea of \\"the priesthood of the masses\\" which was spawned by the Franciscans against papal powers and then later contributed to the peasant revolts, which Luther had also had played a part in and, in the end, feared they had gone overboard, were interesting and not completely developed. The idea of modern democracy being spurred in Switzerland by the inadvertant results of Franciscan endeavors was interesting as well. The rise of nominalism (with Occam's razor, etc.) rising in popularity due to so many false predictions of the end of the world from the mystical circles and the, hinted at, lack of enthusiasm in scholastic circles aided the more grassroots efforts of the Franciscans in changing society at its very core was the most interesting part of the book, yet I felt more could be done in illucidating this.<br /><br />the essays also investigate what is known of this era and where one might want to investigate further.

A compilation of some of the important works of Ruskin are included here, the most important being (in Ruskin's own words) \\"Unto This Last\\", which had a profoundly moving effect on Ghandi (among others) and his approach and philosophy. For Ruskin morality and moral economics, sustaining/healthy economics, comes from basic things like knowing who made your shirts and that this person is getting a fair wage for their efforts -- taking responsibility for the effect one's use of money has on the lives of others. Taking advantage of other's economic misfortune was immoral and likely to result in a future backlash on the greater society as well as well as one's inner well being. An intelligent/knowledgeable person taking advantage of the stupid or ignorant is no different than violence of the strong upon the weak, Ruskin analogized. Ruskin illustrated his ideal of a moral economy by using the Gothic \\"Christian\\" style as an example, explained in the \\"Stones of Venice\\", its communal/community development, its imperfection yet impressive beauty. Perfection is not beautiful in Ruskin's view of life/art; which echoes something of the Zen view of art. Ruskin also argued that homes, during the Gothic age, were in the Gothic style as well and that modern Churches should mimic something of the style of the typical house being built today, the church should not be seen as a separate entity, a separate style; the Church should be integral to the community's self identity and use a similar architecture. Ruskin also inadvertantly created a style and movement he did not aprove of, by creating such a popular view of the Gothic style, that being the Anglo/Catholic movement whom enjoyed the gothic style church and ceremony. (Just walk around most any town and and look at the dates of when Gothic style churches were built in the USA, probably around 1910 or so). (Update - 2013 - It is interesting to look at the influence Augustus Pugin may have had on Ruskin in appreciating the Anglo/Catholic movement and Ruskin's religious view are inconsistant).<br /><br />The wealth of the elite and the wealth of the rich should ultimately be judged by the general happiness of the common man on the street. Ruskin also advocated reading and the building of public libraries and wrote a moving essay on why one should read: included here.<br /><br />Ruskin's life took some passionate twists. His mother had him memorize the Bible while his father inculcated a love for Byron in him. He proved a gifted artist and then studied geology at university. Then an attack by critics on a favored artist, Turner, lead him on an eighteen year quest to study art and explain why Turner is a great artist, writing volumes of popular art history and critiques while developing a love for Giotto and Dante on the way and becoming possibly the most widely read art critic the English-speaking world has ever produced. Then the economic debates rageing in his day between advocates of Smith's laissez-fair, Malthus, Ricardo, Mills, and Marx lead Ruskin to attack all of them and to point out why they all miss the point in some way. Ruskin's approach was organic given: time, place, and circumstances, but he does give models and examples for what good economics is. Ruskin was a great humanist, in general terms he had the heart and approach of a conservative but his results could be described as almost idealic liberalism -- echoing something of Plato's philosopher kings.<br /><br />Ruskin's observations on the English language are also interesting; the hierarchy of words and the distancing of words from their right place and meaning due to English being a diverse language with Latin, Greek, French, and variety of Germanic dialects composing it.<br /><br />In De Profundis, by Oscar Wilde, Wilde must have been profoundly influenced by Ruskin as Wilde expressed regret for not having taken up the moral causes of Ruskin and to have wasted his genius the way he did. Wilde seemed to say that the torch was passed to him and he dropped it. Read this book then De Profundis (which Wilde wrote, without the use of references as he was in prison), and I don't think there will be any doubt that Ruskin had a profound influence on Wilde as Wilde refers to Ruskin-esk themes throughout the book (letter). I think Waugh and Forester echo some Ruskin sentiments as well; Ruskin had a huge influence, well worth reading.assed to him and he dropped it.

A book with five autobiographical travels, three of them being his expectant last journey of life, with required farwell party etc., of Basho with haiku injected by the author, his traveling companions, or persons met along the way. It was quite an interesting read on culture and the way of life in Japan during Basho's day. The book was satisfying and interesting as a travel journal and for a taste of Basho's personality and of the cultural mores of Japanese feudal society.  A sense of the Japanese appreciation of nature and of symbols in nature was also conveyed. Haiku seems to embody something beyond words, natural symbols that we observe everyday captured; a sometimes great ineffable meaning in the mundane.<br /><br />Some of the poetry was good, as far as the translation communicated, however quite a lot also seemed lost in translation that might have been expounded upon. Yuasa Noboyuki, the translator, and writer of the forward, might have done better by talking about these difficulties and that might have brought some light to many of the haikus. The translating haiku with all of the original sense is almost impossible, so I have been told. I also have been told that Ezra Pound expounded, someplace, on just how impossible translating haiku into English is. Noboyuki might have done better to expound on his difficulties translating Japanese haiku into English and his futile attempts to convey the totality of the haiku, which could have raised the vibrancy of some of them; it was vague effort that he included in talking about this aspect.<br /><br />The poems were charming, as were the autobiographical travel stories of Basho. A good read.	2004-04-19

I didn't quite accept the growth, I didn't quite feel swept over with the scenes, but it kept my interest going steadly none the less. It was another shamming story of the English speaking people's mores and morals, some of it justifiable, some not, not well balanced anyway. It was also the Madame Butterfly theme but in this case the English, not the Americans, are the ones shammed: the English see life as a spectacle, view it from the third person, are prejudiced, and value the intellect, with all its faults, over feeling.<br /><br />Forester, in a letter included in the Penguin edition, claims he has a limited intellect or grasp of philosophy. I would have to agree with him. He states, however, that there is another intangible quality that he brings to his writing, unique, another voice; I would agree with that to some extent, at least the method of delivery being so dialogue heavy, and it was fairly good, and the dialogue was mostly stupid, but then most of daily dialogue is stupid especially where intellect rules over feeling, and feeling and thoughts are not closely in harmony with the life one has chosen, and that seemed to be Forester's message, so something new might be jellying here and and he trys to show growth in this muck, although I didn't quite accept it. Byron said much the same thing about English mores and morals, and was much more passionate about it, eloquent, and brought more erudition to his views. Forester's effort is a minor contribution to literature.<br /><br />If you like the humour in this novel you will probably also like Saki, HH Munro.	2004-04-05

Entertaining, funny, meaningful, introspective; couldn't put it down.<br /><br />A seminal work. Much in philosophy, psychology, and literature has been a response or effort to bolster or discuss the implications of this book. Oscar Wilde, in De Profundis, sited his reading of this book with comfort and reflection of the difficulty of being without sin, as well as the Bible. T.S. Eliot called Dante one of the two greatest writers along with Shakespeare. Ruskin often refers to it as other writers do. It is called the Divine \\"Comedy\\" of course it would have to be, but it something profound about psychology and human nature, of course not in absolutes or totality and much in psychology might disprove Dante, but psychology is not an absolute either, or perhaps more so, in that some parade themselves as having an absolute truth. A formative work.<br /><br />Ciardi's translation was highly accessible, junior high school level, and Ciardi justified this by saying that this is the way Dante intended it, although Dante was master of his language and poetic style, it was meant to be an accessible reading, but stylistically Ciardi points out just what a master Dante was.<br /><br />It was a bit amusing how Dante placed so many ecclesiastics with malus animus in his hell, and also his observations about the post Constintine church.	2004-04-01

Death, mayhem, blood, torture, and no sympathetic characters; except, perhaps, the poor. The characters are petty, dishonest, conniving, and superstitious. The forward suggested that Flaubert had something that he needed to get out of his system, with this writing, in order to move on to better things; and I think that is true. But the book is probably more representative of the nature of most wars than say the Lord of the Rings, or such. No one is really fighting, here, for a value system or such and war is hell as Flaubert enthusiastically depicts; no glory here. Although Flaubert hoped for an historical fiction, the forward claims he falls far short of it and the book should be read as a simple fiction.<br />  Salammbo didn't draw me in until the last fourth, even then it wasn't moving, but that might have been Flaubert's intention (or the translator's fault); the lack of pathos or sentimentality part. The first three fourths was a bit tedious or maybe my exposure to sci-fi in my teens made it all blaze; it reminded me of bad sci-fi.<br /><br /> The love affair(s) were undeveloped and not believable. Some of the actions of these born killers is not credible either.<br /><br />So maybe the two finger thing was symbolic of civilization's subtle conforming of the masses, and the priests the driving force behind taming the barbarian in all of us as well as those outside.  Being part of a civiization/society was seen as a privilage until Rousseau flip flopped the whole concept and made the barbarian the noble one. Okay priviliage is based on fear and oppresion justified by religious superstition. A lot of<br />sci-fi books have symbolism to ponder.<br /><br />2012 - Some of the themes in this book are quite powerful. Conformity being subtle, the pride of citizenship (verse the Rousseau-ian \\"Noble Savage\\"). Flaubert did capture something here worth investigating.	2004-03-08
US	50779032	RX28P31ELURF3	0140445803	639487352	The Manuscript Found in Saragossa	Books	5	24	25	N	Y	A Classic that deserves more attention. Plus its funny!	The book is a collection of intertwining, often hilarious, stories of various natures, styles, and character: gothic, romance, a singular mathmatician, erotica, chivalry, adventure, greed, religion from many perspectives. It seems that this novel deserves to be more popular, it fits the modern attention span with its substratum of vignettes, and the larger grand story that encompasses them, a timeless tale. The book is funny and the message profound, but of the bewildering conundrum sort that some great poems often leave one with, as the story intertwines the symbols of various lives into something that was mature and introspective but uplifting and cathartic -- it doesn't rely on words but on situations to do this; so probably losses little in translation as many poems do. If anything it leaves one with stronger sense of brotherhood and love for one's neighbor. Definitely fits with modern multiculturalism, or what it should be anyway, and I guess the author was also a Freemason; a strange bag of humanism. I will never forget some of the images, Potocki had quite an imagination.<br /><br />There are also a lot of parallels with Parzival (the Grail Story) of the farcical sort. The man who can neither stand, nor sit, nor lie (A symbolic castrated Christian in the Grail); the apostasy of one's religion for the sake of a beautiful girl(s) (in Parzival the Muslim gives up his religion without a second thought); mindful, mocking anchorites (in the Grail he scolds Parzival for blowing his chance); the lone search verse the social search.<br /><br />How does one end a book like this? I think the question is was it really meant to end?<br /><br />I recommend reading this perhaps first, as Manuscript parradies it a bit:  [[ASIN:0140443614 Parzival (Penguin Classics)]]<br />Second Read 2017-<br />On the second read I saw a lot of parallels to Cabalism - well it is directly a significant part of the book.  The number 66 is significant to cabalism - the number of chapters in the book.  Cabalism does more to cure the possessed man than the Catholic Hermit.  Although Rebecca ends up giving up her Cabalistic studies and gets more interested in the mathematician, who possibly represents rationalism - although the author seems to say that a study of rationalism leads to a sort of insanity in itself - if not a lucky one and more morally pure by accident.  Cabalism sees Christianity and Islam as misguided Cabalism anyway; but both lack the purity and meaning of the originator - which is Cabalism.  Another interesting theme in the book is the loss of the oral tradition and the the loss of people socialising more together possibly due to the effect of books on society. Just like Ray Bradbury's &#34;Fahrenheit 451&#34; warns of the negative effects of screens/tv/and technology on social life Potocki may be, if not warning, lamenting the loss of social interaction due to all the reading and ink all over our lives, given the book was written about 200 years ago at the height of the novel. With Jerry Garcia, Pushkin, and Salman Rushdie all endorsing the book you can't go wrong in saying this book is going to be interesting and hit on many levels. It may be interesting to look further at the connection with cabalism and numbers represented in the book, or maybe not. Doesn't matter, the book is a good read without going deep into it. Have fun!	2004-02-22

If you like Wodehouse you will probably enjoy Saki too.<br />The forward in the book was of interest, especially after just finishing Byron who Sheed claims created an anti-artist movement in England due the general disfavor Byron had among much of the public. Gilbert and Sulivan as well as Wodehouse, among others, are the resultant anti-artist artists. School Masters throughout England were on guard to make sure they did not produce another Shelly or Byron, drowning would be pretenders to the thrown in ridicule and derision. The likes of Wodehouse, not Flauberts, were the result according to Sheed, who introduced the book.<br />I laughed hardily some four times, chuckled some six times, felt soporific inducement twice, phantom retching feelings thrice. The plot's believability qualifies for the realm of sci-fi. Wodehouse creates a world of unique language and sophomoric hijinks, his anti-hero has a manner of speaking to everyone as if they were an affable child, without condescension, but with a co-conspirital flavor that is approving and jocund -- possibly Wodehouse's greatest quality. The book could be shorter, by some 50 pages, some jokes and jovial flavors of feeling were wrung out for everything they were worth.	2004-01-20

Byron claimed to be outside of metaphysical thinking, which Chesterton said is hypocritical; Byron could not exist without the philosophical generational zeitgeist of Kant, Swedenborg, Lamark and Rousseau and the energy they created towards looking at first causes/orgins; time induced thinking which created the sociological inspired individual responsibility of man towards society and his self-induced muckiness of Malthusian conjectures and the societal induced causes of injustice of Mill towards the individual, and the conjectural futurism of Marx and Hegel, which inspired Darwin, the big bang theory, Hegel's historical religiosity, religious anthropology (then Joseph Campbell), Hitler's paganism, Zionism, other indigenous rights movements, anthropology in general, and psychology. Man's profound and deep rooted sense of his being in the field of time. Byron's \\"Cain\\" seems somewhat inspired by the discovery of fossils and dinosaur evidence by Baron Cuvier.  Byron's energetic placement of himself in the tide of history, destiny, and time was a mark of his times and his interpretation may have influenced Wagner and definitely influenced Neitzsche. He was a product of his age and energy. The same energy America was born under, at least in this geist's earliest stage. Byron was a product of the metaphysics of his day and the generation previous, consciously of Rousseau and unconsciously of the others. Byron rode this wild beast of freedom and liberty of his time and verbally puked over the common sense and good decorum of British good nature and decency. He was a poetic rebel. Poetry would never quite recover and have the good name (according to Wilfrid Sheed in his forward \\"Leave it to Psmith\\") in the English-speaking world but young poetic followers of Byron would be trampled on by teachers, fellow students, and professors ever after. Even today poets are seen as a sort of pest in the eyes of common English-speakers. Byron was extremely popular on the European continent where poetry still has a good name. No other poet has been more talked about since Byron and Byron's criticism of other poets of his day plus his questioning of the honor of Britain surely played a part in that. Byron's energy and ideas left England shocked and she never quite recovered.<br /><br />Goethe said no poet of Byron's stature would come again and he was a formative poet, one where the reader is transformed, and that makes him great; but Goethe also pointed at a child, an immature, aspect of Byron as well.<br /><br />Byron lived a full life, he was a rebel, and a genius. Loving life and living were what he was about and his poetry places himself his actions in some encompassing history of destiny and fate. He had a passion for liberty and humanism yet he maintained an aura of sorrow. His descriptions of himself might well reflect his own on Rousseau (p.127-), except he stood on the opposite side the history of revolution and Napoleon; perhaps he was that of a more matured Rousseau but still immature none-the-less. He often took a stoic sad appreciation of storms, rough waves, avalanches. G K Chesterton pointed to Byron having sad words but his prosody is that of and optimist, he exudes optimism faces his storms with inspiring optimism. Byron was complex and possibly the most influential poet of all time.<br /><br />His success and the challenges it posed to the social mores and what was considered respectable thinking were difficult for Byron's native land to swallow. According to Wilfred Sheed, in his introduction to \\"Leave it To Psmith\\" by Wodehouse, focused academics and Head Masters and such to derisively quell any Byron-like poet upstarts and left the English-speaking world with something shallow, or at the best more subtle. But as France went on to produce Rimbauds and Flauberts the English-speaking world produced entertainment that mocks their sort, and their artsy kind; English entertainment like Gilbert and Sullivan and Wodehouse -- Byron mocked England in his own day the English choose an art that mocked him.  Byron did not glorify the great battles of his nation in his day, like Waterloo, but merely equated England as a sort of cog in history; slowing things down but really not affecting anything for the better. Plus he gave more credit to Russia for Napoleon's defeat then the British might want to have admitted.wn day the English choose an art that mocked him.

It wasn't as graphic and eroticly descriptive as one might be lead to believe by the reviews here; although for it's time apparently it was. The narratives were a bit tedious, dialogue was good, it was a solid story and was worthily meaningful. It seemed to advocate, somewhat in the line of Rousseauian/Romantic thinking that people are born with natures and should endeavor to find and live their authentic selves; society should not chain people to custom, tradition, or have abusive power. I didn't see it as whole hearted anti-Catholic or anti-Christian attack as I saw it as an attack on power and superstition, which not all religious people subscribe to; however it did point to the Romantic notion of there being a higher virtue present in nature it is just a matter of finding one's authentic nature (symptomatic of having one's feelings and actions in harmony). It was in-line with the Romantic/Humanist zeitgeist. The Monk, as the author points out, knew only the life of a monk, from birth, but as the author directly states his nature was something entirely un-monkish which was the root of the problem and the door for which demons could enter (in Lewisfs thinking). Once his authentic nature was awakened he became a threat because he had inauthentic powers which the demons were all too willing to utilize (his inauthentic powers which Romanitic/Humanists wanted to rid the world of); a few other characters are forced into these inauthentic lives as well by corupt uses of power. The hero is someone who is not wrapped in superstition but uses a disguise to hide his power (money/title) so he can know people for who they really are and not have money infringe upon human relationships, he is a Romantic-humanist who proves more virtuous than the church people; his feelings and actions were in harmony and he was not ruled by superstition. The demons are those who enjoy deception and portraying themselves as something they are not, they are the posers and inauthentic peoples who prey on people who are not who they are (and whose feelings and actions are in disharmony) by accident, choice, or vanity, greed, what have you.

She mocks those that are not who they are with gleeful joy, she sees the precipice of hell and dances near it to envoke the anger of demons and mock them, she tells people who they really are, but she is no demon, she asks for money openly and tells it like it is, she even warns people by her manner that to be near her is to unveil disguises, so beaware of the truth -- the truth can be funny, that is what separates comedians (a high art) from clowns.<br /><br />Theodorious disguises himself out of love for his master his intentions are entirely different, his intentions are purely of the heart.<br /><br />The book supports Rousseau's ideas and is in-line with Romantic thinking of the time that society should not place people in chains and perhaps supports Rousseau's statement (in one of the most controversial statements ever and is really the root of public education) gthat people must be forced to be free.hObviously the Monk has many candidates whose lives might be made happier under such a standard<br /><br />A solid book, if it is taken in the right spirit.

Living naturally is what the crux of this book is all about.<br /><br />The book delves into ethics, civics, justice, philosophy, psychology, and I think it is a healthy tool for understanding classical literature: Shakespeare, for example, and the inner psychology of his characters as this moral plain, that Pieper describes, is so much closer to his than most of what we hear in our modernity.<br /><br />Pieper, here, spends time defining what the classic moral compass is, taken primarily from the last officially sanctioned church doctor St. Thomas Aquinas. Pieper brings Aquinas and other philosophers' language up to date, for the ears of the modern mind. Christianityfs definition has too much to do with how it's enemies, or alterior users, wish to define it and Pieper spends a short time correcting this in places.<br /><br />If you liked this you might like Pieper's Virtues of the Human Heart which is a bit less discriptive but more powerful.<br /><br />Pieper also makes the point that the most important stuggle is the internal struggle for meaning and direction in any organization or person.	2003-11-07

Taken in the context of a classic literary debate on human nature I could appreciate this book. a real window to the French zeitgeist of Flaubert's times, and influential even on the present state of the French weltanschauung. He points at the nature of human beings, which was a bit disparaging of a verdict, or was it? Was it just the way things are in a nonjudgmental way. He gave some wonderful snap-shots of life in Paris around 1848 and seemed to give an objective view of a critical, if not underrated, moment in world history. Human nature is a conniving/duplicitous one and more than likely people become victims of their own connivances. Those who are singularly minded were rather boring and shallow. However, for Flaubert, like Goethe, friendship and love still, somehow, remain in tact as the highest virtue even through all the muck, egotism, and self-rightousness the book describes -- but, one could argue, Flaubert arrives there by more legitimate means than some other great authors who have pointed in that direction.<br />He seemed to be debating directly with the great works of the past, actually there are many parallels to Dickens \\"Great Expectations\\". and Goethe's \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" These books are hinted at. It is stated that someone has no \\"expectations\\" (Dickens) and \\"The Sorrows\\" is more directly talked about on p. 413. Flaubert in debate with great authors, and not taken for his sadistic qualities, works quite well. This book, juxtaposed, to the two aforementioned books would be great topics of discussion; also Maslow \\"theories of peak experiences\\" seem apropos to mention in the context of a discussion on this book. Flaubert was saying, to me, that one is essentially born with a nature, or at the least it develops early on, and behaviors show themselves in various circular patterns of endeavor. The story of his youth, at the end, is a micro pattern of macro reoccurring events throughout the book. Frederic's idealization of Madame Arnoux saves him from a worse fate than Wether's idealization of Charlotte: Werther ends up committing suicide for his love, however, Frederic is possibly saved from a fate worse than death.<br />Flaubert's foray into the forest (323) it is filled with symbolism, and seemed like key pages that I didn't grasp well.

Well, Etienne Gilson, in this book, \\"Heloise and Abelard\\" sets out to solve a real mystery set in medieval times; that of the intricacies of love, an unplanned pregenancy, and the resultant problems (Abelard ,was castrated (but two of his assailants were, under Christian justice at the time, given the same treatment, as well as having their eyes gouged out)). Gilson in the manner of detective and psychologist, as well as historian, attempts to deal out justice as well as look inside people's hearts, and discover their true intents (which he admits in the end, God only knows). The true story of Heloise's love for Abelard is one of the most endearing ever told and something that many medievalists tinker around with (including Heiko Oberman) Abelard was on superstar status, in his day, as a professor of theology and philosophy in age where students had much more leeway to choose their teachers and professors were paid by the number of students they had; Abelard was so popular he had to hold classes outside. Part history, part philosophy (or history of philosophy), and Gilson takes some liberties at psychologizing a bit. If you like Umberto Eco you might like this book as well, but read about them on the internet or in an encyclopedia before you start, if you know nothing about them, as Gilson gets right into the detectiving with little background details. There are all kinds of devious and/or devoted monks that Abelard must contend with, like the monks in Umberto Eco's stories.<br /><br />Favorite quotes, from the book:<br /><br />\\"Their appeal (Heloise and Abelard's) is to a system of ethics which separates the order of acts from the order of intensions(65).\\"<br /><br />\\"They both played the comedy of sanctity(53).\\"<br /><br />\\"What is a husband but a domesticated beast of burden\\"(31, Gilson quoting Theophratus).<br /><br />Some interesting words on marriage, death, love, loyalty, wisdom, sorrow, and providence are also expounded on. Gilson (despite Heiko Oberman in his book \\"Dawn of the Reformation\\" placed Gilson, with the name of Arnold Toynbee, as an arbitrary period in history making sophist) clearly states, in the last chapter, that separating the medieval times with the Renaissance -- especially given what huge a word renaissance entails and the disparaging implications for the time previous -- points out the silliness of such a word as Abelard and, especially, Heloise have many \\"Renaissance\\" charatoristics despite belonging to the Medieval age.<br /><br />Some of the writing is superfluous, as Gilson repeats himself longwindedly.

It is personal and readable, near Poetical.<br />Augustine was on a path to learn truth, find God, and experienced twists and turns of self-doubt and a divided will that, I think, anyone pursuing knowledge might find of interests, or someone a bit delusioned and cynical about life may find solace in. Augustine's message is a passionate one, this passion is the shining attribute of his confession -- his giving himself over to a life of honest endeavor to do God's will. He defines what the spirit of an honest pursuit looks like, and could be somewhat applied to all pursuits of truth. It is a bit cathartic to read about this often divided and quite human of a man, who I can't see how anyone could apply the terms orthodox or evangelical too (an Effort/Endeavor seems more on terms with a Christian's experience), and how he came to terms with the mysteries that are in our world. His description why it is impossible to know truth ultimately, but his conlusions behind the message of the meaning of mysteries is powerful stuff in themselves.<br />Some interesting themes I found, that Augustine expounded on were:<br />The mysteries of time and memory and what their being mysteries means.<br />How the soul and music are akin.<br />Some differences in exegesis are just quibbles that one should agree to disagree on among sincere souls.<br />Physical delight needs to be checked by reason (Augustine was coming to terms with lust, apparently, even at the time of this writing).<br />Don't be overly dependant on the praise of man.<br />Even contempt of the vain can be a vanity of its own sort.<br />His descriptions of the third temptations.<br />His admiration of his mother and his descriptions of the sort of person she was.<br />The true search is the inner search.<br />There are things the church does to get people interested that are lower than the true spiritual Christian search<br />Confession is sacrifice...<br />Almost every page was interesting.<br />Augustine was always surrounded by friends and was never in serious wanting of food or such, that I understood anyway. It is just the account of a highly intelligent, but splinterd man in search of God, until he comes to terms with the Christian mysteries of good.<br />I could hear Shakespeare, Waugh, and Wilde echoing in some of his words. Mr. Chadwich also makes it clear that Augustine barrowed a lot from Neo-Platonist authors, especially Plotinus.  The book also provides interesting insights into life in North Africa and Italy at that time, and their cultural differences. Augustine, like Aquinas, was North African.<br />The book was relatively light reading, and highly accessible -- but deep -- especially taken in its entirety. Chadwick's translation, although I cannot attest to the authenticity of it, as I know no Latin, was near poetical and his notes kept my interest by aiding my understanding, clarifying themes and points, without obfuscating the passion of Augustine's message.<br />Highly catharctic, enjoyable reading.rounded by friends and was never in serious wanting of food or such, that I understood anyway.

He is anti-altruistic, through and through, as he despises do gooders as self-serving and self-martyring and having no real good in mind.  The \\"good\\" lays in good food, done by a good cook. Saki, interestingly, mocks futurism (the art form of Italian fascism) and Wagnerians and Nietzschians (the not unjustly adopted composer and unjustly misconstrued philosophical guru of the Nazis). He was also anti-suffragette and one of his stories is pathetic in his denounciations of them; but he was not misogynist as he has many smart female charaters in his stories. He is a joy to read, maybe the antithesis of Charles Dickens who one could claim is way too verbose and a dreamer on the virtues of strangers (although I like Dickens), Saki is concise and holds little value in the supposed goodness of strangers. One of the books one should read in their late teens.  His novels are interesting and moderately entertaining but lack a sense of completion and posssibly nimbus a show at some limit to his depth.

Reading this book first might make his other works (like Virtues of the Human Heart, Abuse of Language Abuse of Power, and Leisure the Basis of Culture) more palitable. Pieper, here, describes what philosophy is - its likeness to poetry; why it should be done - freedom can not exist without it; and where philosophy stands in relationship to the exact sciences and religion. Pieper, with great detail, also lays Sartre flat, and critisizes Jaspers and Heidegger to the degree that they fail to recognize their own religiosity and how this contridicts their views of what a philosopher is -- throwing their own words in thier face, so to speak. Great reading.<br />This book might read something like a simple methodology; much more comprensible than \\"Living the Truth\\" which is quite a book, a definite methodology, but difficult reading.	2003-05-26

Some were of a personal nature concerning Noel's philosophy of life: which was something of being an Ockhamist's and he was also anti-altruistic. He seemed influenced in a proginal sense by Saki; a dialectical sense by Wilde; and an antagonistic sense by Waugh. The stories ranged from being very good (Bon Voyage and What Mad Pursuit) to very bad (Traveler's Joy and Stop Me if You've Heard It). The most personal, concerning the purpose of life, was \\"Nature Study\\" which was enlightening and Noel gave a very simple definition of his philosophy there. The, perhaps, most personal account of his own life was \\"A Richer Dust\\" the meaning of which may only be known by Noel and was not a great story. I give the book as a whole four and a half stars.

All too often Leonardo's name has been attached to support a variety of causes of this or that nature. Being, seemingly, irreligious and unphilosophic while being the quintessential Renassaince Man. His name is often used as a mascot to justify the ideals of this or that group of whatever. He was clearly an animal rights lover, possibly a closet Franciscan, in all probability a homosexual (although not much of an activist). Leonardo was into his thoughts and had little patience for something that was already complete in his mind. He left scores of unfinished works, and minons of angry patrons - contrary to Bornstin's book that Leonardo was in constant search of patrons - Clark says he had many unhappy patrons. Leonardo was an animal lover who hated violence (although he designed armaments of various sorts). His depth of religious devotion could be argued, but he was not irreverant, as some have claimed. Leonardo was rather Franciscan and had a fondness for animals and individuality. He was free and valued his own individualism. Other than Da Vinci's notebooks nothing much authentic comes down to us. Every other work of Leonardo has been severally retouched or destroyed, what there is left of Leonardo's work is highly speculative - what bit is in his hand ect. Clark gives a healthy, vibrant, nonproselytizing look at a genius - something anyone might find interesting.	2003-02-24

Someone said it wasn't, because he is too insensitive. I think his interpretation is acurately acted. Holmes is an intellect and is only caring if he is really deeply moved - or as a ploy. He is not by nature one to show what a caring person he is; but he is - and sometimes will show that if he thinks it really will make some difference. He is obsessed with thoughts, facts, data, music, and getting inside someone's skin.  The showing of feeling is not big on his list, however the passion for his science is clear. So Brett being insensitive, on most occassions, jive's well with Doyle's Sherlock. Watson was, of course, the more feeling one.<br />I read somewhere that Doyle wrote most of these stories while at the track, betting on horses. It is believable. Most of the stories read like a sketch.	2003-02-08

Gilson makes a point that historians of philosophy (or teachers of philosophy, for that matter) are not necessarily philosophers. The same could be said for the sciences as well - that a science historian or teacher is not necessarilly a scientist. Gilson argues, however, that an education in the history of philosophy is essential to a well-rounded education, if for no other reason to show how unalone people are in their thoughts and supposed first thoughts. It would be useful to discuss even those philosophers who were wrong, just to obtain the full-spectrum of thinking and its history. Gilson is, of course, an avid disciple of Aquinas; as well as an admirer of Aristotle, Plato, and Augustine. Gilson`s master book was \\"The Unity of the Philosophical Experience\\".	2003-02-08

Dorian Gray's problem, despite the fact all his sin is transmited to a painting, art reminds him of the good, and this reminding is enough to be in discord with himself. I don't feel, as some suggest, that Dorian regreted his wish of eternal youth and beauty, but the images of the painting, art itself, drove him crazy - his self doubt. The art showed his inauthentic life, how his feelings and actions were not in harmony. In De Profundis Wilde talks about Jesus' criticism of the Pharasee for studying, but not living what they know - they have no feeling for life, they are souless driviling intellects. Dorian`s cognizance of his own inauthentic soulless profanatory abject self did him in, he died killing the reminder of his splintered self, and of the frustrations of being an aesthetically induced schizopherenic. Wotton's warning was that conscience makes egoists of us all. Is it the dualistic nature of conscience that drives Dorian to kill himself, not regret? In the end he desires to do good, but is it? Can he? Is he? Wilde, the master of Paradox, leaves some poignant questions, if not eschatological questions, availab.le to be thought upon. Wilde is highlighting the importance of art as truth and art as a mirror, but in the end who is the mirror? Art makes reality, as far as reality is a truth anyway, a perception of truth and reality that is more meaningful than these nonexistant abstracts. But then there is sin to ponder on, is it real? Wilde would say so.	2002-05-23

Pieper defines how modern thought has corrupted much of our vocabulary - in comparison with the Medieaval use - of such words as: truth, reality, knowledge, perception, idea, essence, object, subject, imagine, potential capacity, natural, ideal, cognition, will. He also makes an effort to clear the name of Aquinas, from past abusers of his ideas, Aquinas being the primary philosopher Pieper draws his ideas from. Pieper largely defends Medieaval thought against the Modern. The Modern insignificantly began with Montaigne, significantly started with Decarte, and became rock solid with Kant (each with their legions of followers). Pieper is a defense of what there was before. How what is good in the Western Tradition fundamentaly lays there. The book's points are profound; at their essence the most profound of all of Pieper's books I have read thus far. However, they are also the most abstract and possibly the least accessable to the common reader, such as myself.<br />Many of Pieper's books read much more as a guide to living a better life, this is not one of them. Abuse of Language Abuse of Power is, as are Leisure the Basis of Culture and The Virtues of the Human Heart - and many of his other books I have not read as of yet. These books are accesible and ones, I believe, that will result in a reader making postive life changes significantly altering one's view of the world for the better, for themselves and their brothers.	2002-05-05

This translation was highly accesible and fluid.<br />The Sorrows of Young Werther, due to its immense popularity and anchor work of the Romantic senitimantalist zietgiest (and still the most enduring philosophy to our day) the rule of individual sentiment and worship of man in his most primative state (although a much Romantically contrived Rousseauian vission of that), stands as a book that is highly recommended to historians and historians of philosophy.  In comparrison the book stands as much of a representative of Romanticism as Camus' THE STRANGER does to Existentialism (that near, if not already dead, philosophy). Romanticism still prevails and THE SORROWS stands as primary work.  Confussion seems to occur because this book, in many degrees, does not seem to corrospond with Goethe's philosophy when one takes his life as a whole.  This book was one of Goethe's earliest works, the one that brought him immidiate international fame, but over-all it seems to be more reflective of Rousseau's philosophy than Goethe's, when one takes their lives as a whole. Goethe was to later out-do this book with many other master works, although not so much so in the general public's mind. The arguement that civilization and especailly books are a corrupting force, the individual is best when left in his primative state following his passions and first thoughts, one's being is in nature echoing, listen and know, don't think.  We are really Children.  Although there seemed to be some internal contradiction as to what being a child is in Goethe's mind, but then there was in Rousseau's, and also what man closest to nature was.<br />What is beautiful in this book, for me, is how it compliments Jesus' criticism of the Pharisee that they study, read and praise themselves and have power in their positions, but they have no feeling for what they know, their hearts are not there, they only dictate and recite, they have no spirit, no soul for the things they attest to know.<br />If your feeling low or depressed read the first half of this book and I am sure you will recieve an instant boost of energy.  It is full of passion and vigor for life.  Although this type of passion leads to a suicide, Goethe may have been unconciously critisizing Rouseau all along.<br />Historically this book is much greater than Goethe; philosophically Goethe is much greater than this book.ling low or depressed read the first half of this book and I am sure you will recieve an instant boost of energy.

The book should, however, be read more as a guide to Japanese root words, idioms, and philosophical expressions.  For instance, WA meaning HOLY HARMONY is not commonly used.  It would be like saying BENE means GOOD in English when it is a root for many words that have something to do with good - like benevolent, benefit, benediction ect... .  But WA can be found in HEIWA (peace) and WAFU (Japanese style) amoung others.  The book is full of stereo-types, both good and bad, which should not be taken too seriously or read like a Bible.  Japan is a complex country undergoing constant change and it is full a wide variety of individuals with varied interests and talents and prejudices.  But the book contains some general insights that one can explore on their own and judge for oneself whether they agree or not with it. Some of the expressions are not popularly used and if one were to say them to Joe Yamamoto on the street they would have no clue what you were talking about.  But again, however, the roots, or part of what is being said in the book, can be found in other expressions. You would need the help of a native speaker to truly make good use of this book, a dictionary would do some good.<br />I find that many Japanese people I know are interested in the expressions contained in the book, as they are deep and abstract in nature, important, but not always thought about.  I find it lends to people helping me learn Japanese as they also have something interesting to explore, and many Japanese enjoy talking to me about these terms and ideas.  It serves as a great ice breaker.<br />If you are just interested in the world of ideas, or how language helps formulate or reflect those ideas and the sources by which they came, then the book could serve as something of value and interest.  Again, is there a better book?<br />The book gives a Japanese expression, or word, and then discuses, in English, the significance of it and how it reflects the Japanese psyche and sometimes how it can be found in other words. The author writes in a mature style and has a world of knowledge and experience about and in Japan.r book?  <br />The book gives a Japanese expression, or word, and then discuses, in English, the significance of it and how it reflects the Japanese psyche and sometimes how it can be found in other words.

The essays detail the scholastic arguements of the day and how Thomas, in the true spirit of open mindedness (his life and method are the definition of this oft abused term) brought some peace ond understanding to the various sides, a very serious matter in his day. The book explains how much of an Aristotilian Aquinas was, and more importantly how much he was not. Mainly by showing how the charactoristics of the Latin Averroists have been unjustly attributed to Aquinas by his detractors - the Latin Averoists (Averoes was an Arab) were whole hearted Aristotilians.<br />This book is an excellent addition to reading Etienne Gilson's \\"Unity of the Philosophical Experience\\" as Pieper gives further explanantions as to the behavior of the Augastinians and Latin Averroists. It could explain also why modern Muslims are so singularly textually dogmatic - it is in reaction to Averroist's attempting to rid religion of faith altogether - and thus the violent reaction in nixing reason and rationalism. It tells how Aquinas circumvented this problem. The last essay also compliments Gilson's book in that it shows what Existentialism has in common with Aquinas, some interesting things, despite some gapping fundimental differences at their very root and conclusion.<br />The first essay vividly descibes what an attitude of accademic pursuit and teaching should look like. Too many teachers are dogmatic and are only interested in pursuing and supporting an idea that is presently clear in their minds and propogating it, rather than treating the moment as an active pursuit of truth. Thomas was a model teacher and the book is an active discripition of his method.<br />The book also argues, with supporting evidence and reason, that Thomas' main work The \\"Summa Theologica\\" was intentionally left unfinished. Why it was left unfinished is at the root of what Aquinas was all about concerning philosophy and metaphysics - it is a process not a conclusion.  Gilson's book describes what a conclusion is, as sometimes philosophers have rejected the idea that they have reached a conclusion, when in fact they have. Gilson effectively defines what a conclusion looks like.<br />Both are highly recommended books for Teachers, Historians, and Philosophers.losophy and metaphysics - it is a process not a conclusion.

Gilson defines the coming war, World War II, as a philosophical war of two different heads of Hegelianism. Communism, which is inspired by a look forward, into what will be, and helping it along (all conjecture of course); and the Hitlarian (Romantic) looking to the past. Thus Hitler's paganism and his desire to rid Europe of all nonindigionious elements, especially Semetic. Christianity, after all, is a conquering force upon the natural purity and indigoniousness of Europe. It is a glorification of what man, or more importantly, a nation (peoples) would be had they been left in their natural state uncorupted by foreign elements. A Darwinian, Rousousian, Kantian mix (among others) that created the ultranationalistic Romanticism. Gilson defines these misguided principles (still the dominant principles of today) as leading to a future tragic bloody war. But it also explains why Japan, in WWII, wished to be rid of Americanism in their culture, and of any foreign influences. Anyway it leads to extreme nationalism that is just an end result of Romanticism. The problems with defining the truth of Hitler to modern minds is we are not far removed from the thesis and antithesis of his metaphyiscal plain.<br />The most important thesis of the book, however, is Gilson's defense that philosophy and more importantly metaphysics is a process and not a conclusion. Once one has made metaphysics a conclusion it ceases to be Metaphysics. Metaphyics can supose a greater truth, like an octagon being closer to a circle than a hexagon, but to incompus all truth is at least a human impossibility. However there have been many cycles in the history were postulations of a \\"metaphysical\\" entirety of truth have lead to philosophical cycles of argumentation, sometimes with real physical consequences. These cycles have turned into philosophical battles between true metaphyics and the false. The most recent false metaphicans have been Hegel, Kant, Carte, Hume, Descartes, and William of Ockham, plus their various disciples. The first cycle, Gilson defines, is that of Thales, 2,600 years ago, claiming all is an absolute of everything being air, followed by Anaximenes claiming everything was not air but water, and then Heraclitus caliming all is fire, then the first synthasis of this absurdity was Anaxaimander saying that the common things of all this stuff was indeterminable.<br />Gilson spends most of his effort, 99% of it, in defining the modern and medieaval cycles of metaphysical certatude and the resulting problems. Any summary of it would not do it justice.<br />The importance of this book to historians and pilosophers and historians of philosophy is immense. I don't know of any other book which so vividly paints a picture of modern thinking and how \\"it\\" got here than this book. Although I must admit I got hopelessly lost in the discriptions of Descarte's postulations, but the thesis of Descartes was made clear. One could go on forever about this book it is a cornicopia of ideas for further study and expansion. Highly recommended for any student of history or philosophy. Gilson brings a view that cannot be ignored. The question I have for Gilson, if I could ask it, is does Gilson agree that error illuminates the truth, as Aquinas did, and further, if error is good.<br />Gilson convincingly argues that there is unity to the philosophical experience and this experience is illuminating on the nature of man and perhaps more.ant, Carte, Hume, Descartes, and William of Ockham, plus their various disciples.

Words like: faith, prudence, listening, silence, fortitude, patience, sensuality, passion, anger, indolence, magnamity, humility, hope, and acedia. The modern mind, it would appear, has lost the vocabulary keys to salvation and proper moral elocution. Pieper argues, in the simpliest, if not only way, I can define, that too much subjection of one's senses to unfilterd, unanalyzed, unrationalized, unpassioned exposure can lead to a distancing from one's true nature of self, and also a distancing, if not hopeless seperation, from cummunication with the divine. The between-the-lines inference here is too much tv, newspapers, cnn, and anything that is unpassioned and unrationalized to oneself is detrimental to the soul. It is noise, noise, and does not fill the heart, too much of this state and one's heart can get out of tune, possibly irrevocably. Pieper argues that acedia is the state of one not fulfilling the true beauty of one's divine nature and passion. This laziness of endeavor is a sin against nature and God, as well as to oneself. Not a feel good bandaid sort of book of nice little aphorisms. This book is deadly serious and after a serious reading one might be lucky enough to realize the big job involved in being oneself, and how important that is to God. As serious as the air one breaths. Silence and rationalized enrichment, Pieper defines them both. A superficial reading of the book might lead one to think it is just a bunch of unconnected maxims - far from it. A nice little book. Bring a dictionary.	2002-02-05
US	50779032	RGHATY2KJ0HEA	0140434895	365726027	Great Expectations (Penguin Classics)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A great coming of age story	Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good.  The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul.	2002-02-03

For those that do love this book it probably says something questionable about them.  I first thought of this book as Existentialism meets Catholicism, in a uniquely English sardonic way. I think there is more to it than that. It is a about a man in conflict with the noise of life, he finds himself through the love of a college mate who he engages in undergrate frivolity with, despite the urgings of a graduate student relative.  The haunting aspect of this novel maybe that the noise of life turns out to be his wife, his children, as well as his relationship with the army, and his own dad.  The man that, if any, can be given credit for helping the narrator find himself, ends up losing himself.  They all seem to lose themselves, in the end, except for one saving grace, their Catholic faith - which the narrator, despite much incredulity, in the begininning, also seems to fall into.  After reading the reviews posted here I think it is safe to say that you may or may not like this book to the extreme.  However, there does seem to be a universal love of the 1982 video series, with Jeremy Irons. The thred that seems to run through the Evelyn Waugh books, that I have read thus far, is the mockery of guru sorts that are often found in Existential novels. Maybe he is saying that one should not expect to save themselves, or find meaning, in anything but faith. The rest is noise.  It is just troubling what the noise turns out to be.<br /><br />Added in 2016:<br />Unfortunately, in 2016, after reading Proust, I have to say that this book is basically religious propaganda and a rip off of In Search of Lost Time.	2001-06-01

His words and insights compliment Shakespeare beautifully.  I would, however, recommend that one does not read his commentary on the play until after one has developed their own view of the play's meaning. So, I suggest reading Goddard after seeing the play because Goddard is mostly interested in analyzing the play, and one can see how closely their opinion matches Goddard's.  I would, however, recommend reading Isaac Azimov's \\"Guide to Shakespeare\\" before seeing or reading a play. Asimov is more interested in explaining the internal concepts, historical relevence of peoples, places, things, Elizabethan terms etc... - his book acts as more of a key to better understanding what is being said.  Goddard is a beautiful interpreter of the moral meaning and in attempting to grasp at the soul of Shakespeare - which one should obviously do on their own first, before consulting \\"expert\\" opinion.  So read Asimov before the play and Goddard a few days after.  Each has their books divided into 10-20 page discussions on each play.  Although note that Goddard has two books, be sure to get the right book.	2001-05-24

Although the information contained in \\"English Words - From Latin and Greek Elements\\" is of a high quality, and of the sort that my students would benefit from, it is given at a level which requires intelligence and patience. The book might work well for Juniors and Senior high students at advanced level; however the book, I believe, was not designed to be copied. It is tightly formated and each lesson builds upon the next. You might try the aforementioned book for your typical high school student.	2001-05-17

Of all of Pieper's books I have read, thus far, none conjured up similarities of thought to Von Eschenbach's &quot;Parzival&quot;, or Joseph campbell, or Allan Watts as this book does. His discription of the complications of staying in the state of &quot;being-besides-oneself&quot; may be the sort of advice Parzival might have used on his first experience of being in the Grail Castle; or, for that matter, for a surfer riding a wave. Pieper says the trouble is, &quot;He can on condition (of being-besides-oneself) that when recieving the impetus born of emotion, he accepts and sustains it in lasting purity. In this context the possibilities of corruption, adulteration, dissimulation, pretension, and psuedo-actualization lie dangeriously close.&quot; It reminds me of Joseph Campbell saying &quot;the privilidge of a life-time is being who you are&quot;; or Allan Watts discussing the benifits of living in spontaneity, trusting in one's first thoughts, without the duelistic inner voice of self-doubt that makes one a splintered person; or, for that matter, &quot;The Force&quot;; or, further, the Kaballa's admiration of chaos; or Albert Camus' facination with the absurd.  Pieper, in a nutshell, states that this divinely inspired &quot;being-besides-oneself&quot; may come from an unforseen act of chaos or &quot;ecstatic frenzy&quot;; or submission to god, creation; or Poetic mania; or beauty (of a very specific nature). Peiper, seemed to be saying, that like the Holy Grail, this &quot;being-besides-oneslef&quot; is a difficult thing to find if one is, on the whole, consciously looking for it.  Pieper seemed to struggle to find a voice for this book, and it didn't seem entirely complete, thus the 4 stars.	2001-05-10

A bit abusive language on my part.<br /><br />The question is worth pondering, and the questions raised in this book are of the sort that any educated man should ponder, even if there is no solution, it makes great \\"smartening-up\\" not \\"dumbing down\\" (sloganism) of the curriculum.  Peiper persuasively argues that communication is not happening as much as might be thought, because communication must be void of ulterior motives.  And his arguement that we must be able to express our view of the \\"truth of things\\" in freedom; why many do not is due to what he calls \\"the lingo of the revolution\\".	2001-04-13
