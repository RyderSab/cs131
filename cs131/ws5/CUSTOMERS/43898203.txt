If you have a leg up on pronunciation, this is a great book for some basic introduction to the Spanish language, at any age! If not, something with a CD will be better for you.<br /><br />Other good choices are Ana Lomba products (not designed for coloring in, but still great!) or board books by Boynton or Wemberley - though some of the translations are iffy.<br /><br />Sra.

She's not a \\"funny\\" as her old comic strips used to be, but she always hits home, and always leads me to look forward to the following strip. This book is another wonderful collection, with insight, some good puns, and a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. But mostly, the ability to know your life is \\"normal!\\" Lynn Johnston identifies with us, and then draws it. Wonderful!	2005-08-08

How WONDERFUL to know I'm not alone in the moments that I want to cry, this \\"full-time\\" mothering stuff is so hard, but instead I choose to laugh, not in a small part due to Baby Blues. I don't know if their books mirror my life, or my life mirrors their comedic endeavors, but I'm not complaining. If you're a parent, you will like this book. It'll either bring back memories, or show you what's to come, depending on the age(s) of your bundle(s) of joy. ENJOY!	2005-08-08

He's won a space on my shelf where I can easily reach after a long day of normal crazy life. Calvin and Hobbes books have been pushed over, and now I reach for Get Fuzzy. He even makes me want to get a pet...sort of, but then not, because of Bucky...well, you need to laugh and read this book. It's weird humor, but I think the bulk of America will get it, and enjoy it. Try it out!	2005-08-08

I didn't use it because I didn't feel it was clearly and concisely introducing words or phrases - it seems a little confusing for that age group.<br /><br />I do like the bright colors and that there are CD's with the set, as well as the songs (which REALLY help little kids learn a second language.) As a parent and teacher, I just wish it was a little less jumbled in the lessons...Not a lot of writing to do - just reading and listening. There are many more interactive approaches out there, which comes with a CD, or you can get some board books in Spanish by Boynton or Wemberley. Ana Lomba has several good child-focused products as well.<br /><br />Sra. Gose<br />Mother, Teacher, Author<br />Flip Flop Spanish Series	2005-05-14
