I have joined an eco reading group in hopes of saving at least two or three of human kind to continue life on this planet.  Carson has set the background for what my favorite scientist/writer of the 21st century, Dr. Hulda Clark has dovetailed on.  It comes as no surprise that Dr. Clark books which were written starting 1993 were met by the same kind of corporate outcry and government disclaimer as what happened to Rachel Carson.  I hope society learns something from how they  mistreated Carson and not make the same mistake with Dr. Clark.<br />I am a strong supporter of Dr. Clark and her protocols for curing/preventing/treating many of the ills,--cancer, hiv/aids and immune system destroying diseases--as Carson fortold in her books some 42 years ago.<br />Presently, the government is dragging Dr. Clark to court because they do not want her work to be recognized for improving the health of many Americans.  I SCREAM FROM THE HIGHEST TOWER THAT HER SCIENCE HAS SAVED MY LIFE AND I AM ETERNALLY GREATFUL.	2004-06-15

What a wonderful read this mystery and thriller turned out to be.  I must confess that I was expecting it as I have already read &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot;.  <br />Alex Cross is an exciting character to read about.  Thank God for the availability of SOME BLACK HEROS.  I know that they exist, but, do others know this.  One way of proving it is through authors like James Patterson.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <br />Alex Cross certainly was not going to let some measley British Intellegence Official out smart him and continue killing off Washington, D.C. citizens.  Why the great seat of government would be embrassed should such an act take place.  Alex Cross seems to be the precursor to the present day Montgomery County Chief Charles A. Moose.  Moose, as most of us know, soared to the front of the international news scene when in 2002 he captured the infamous BELTWAY SNIPER MURDER CRIMINAL in the Washington, D.C./Maryland/Virginia areas.  It wouldn't surprise me if Chief Moose took his directions from Alex Cross. (smiles)<br />Needless to say, I highly recommend this book and I also recommend all of the Alex Cross series.  I sure will be reading each and every one.  You will be able to read more about how I view the world through my reviews (smiles, I love you too, Beverly C.

That is, a significate character in determining a complete circle or 360 degrees. What a wonderful read it was.  I listen to this story on cassett tapes.  I believe that the reader, who spoke in the Hindu religion accent made this book all the more refreshing.  Ergo, that sense of hearing the story read with the right tone completes the circle of enjoyment.<br />Now for the story.  Poor Pi suffered early childhood taunts from the neighborhood &quot;hoods&quot; because of his name which was not a typical Indian name.  I believe he sorted and found relief in establishing his nickname as Pi not because of the meaning I attributed to his name but because it was shorthand for Pistingh.<br />In deed, this could easily have been a true story for I enjoyed it as if it were true.  Pi's struggle with religion, surviving the sea, the animals, the Japanese Men and his limited exposure to life contributed heavily to the enjoyment of this book.<br />He did what I would have done had I found myself in a similar situation.  There were some parts of this book which did exceed my imagination, however.  But, I won't spoil it for you by telling everything that is in this wonderful epic.  Read it for youself.  But, be prepared to laugh, shout for joy, whistle for happiness, hum a song, praise, encourage, commiserate and disbelieve as Pi unravels his quest for religion, faith and survival.---LET THOSE TV STATIONS TAKE NOTE OF WHAT A REAL SURVIVAL STORY LOOKS LIKE.---Beverly C.

I am completely surprised that Gruenfeld did not receive more reviews here on Amazon.com--only 9...  Truly, the cost should have sent a message that this was not one of the usual novels.  And, I surely agree. This was a fabulous read.  I enjoy legal stories and this one tops Grisham's books.  I also have an affinity with this book as I, too, have a computer background.  Thanks to Gruenfeld he had the ability to marry the two fields with the human experience and walked away with my heart.  <br />Rebecca Verona was an ace attorney and her client was betting his life (or prison term) on her ability to set him free.  Notwithstanding the fact that he (a computer business millionaire) had aborted a recent love affair with her, he knew if she would defend him inspite of their past relationship (well know by all) that her defense would send the message that he was innocent of the charge of treason.<br />Weaved into the plot was the workings of encryption, sabatoge, computer theft, and oh yes--the prosecuting attorney who also was a recent ex-lover of Rebecca.   Can't you see this being reality.  Life is often very complicated as this story plays out.  I highly recommend this book and hope that Gruenfeld keeps these wonderful books coming.	2003-04-16

She writes about a very passionate married couple who goes through many trials and tribulations only to be faced with shortcomings of one of their childern.  That said, this book tells about how the wife literally wills her near death war inflicked husband back to life.  She also, after his revival, births three more children to add to the first child (son) they had together and moves on to developing a career for herself and the family.  Ergo, the title, Jewels, is about how she created an empire of jewelry that brought her fame and fortune.

Before turning her business over to the grown children, she loses her husband (a veteran) to the military contracted illness.

From the reviews here on Amazon.com, you have succeeded at reaching a cross-reference of mixed opinions.  All that is good stuff.  What a dull world it would be if everybody thought the same about everything at the same time. <br />I found the book very enjoyable.  I love the fact that this book was based on the real story.  That said, the author is limited as to how much beyond the truth he dears to trespass.  I believe you did a tremendous job of describing the life of the character Flora, however pathetic she was.  I loved the way you factored in the human elements of life which often times are not always very pretty.  For example, when seeking love from wherever you can find it may lead one into some dark and ugly places.  So it was with Flora.  I sensed a sad bit of humanity in her character that many who would rather not be reminded of these factors would attack your writings or your novel for having revealed them.  There they were, laid bare for the whole world to read.  My take on this is, if there is something in Flora that you don't feel comfortable with, then do something about those characteristic in people you deal with in real life.<br />Thank you again Rehak, and may you write many more books that deal with touching individuals in places that no other author has managed to do.  Please feel free to contact me whenever as we develop and learn along life's highway.   If there are other authors you recommend that I read, let me know about them also. --Bevery C.

After over 900 reviews of this book on amazon.com at this writing, I am sure that I have nothing new to add to the overall review than what has already been said.  However, of the reviews that I did read few thought this story, rising star lawyer turned  lawyer of the poor and homeless was unreal.<br />While I thought the plot was wonderful, I thought that the realities of such a thing happening was next to none.  Lets face it, we are a class, money-driven, my yacht is bigger than yours society.  If Grisham had made his character, Michael, more realistic I could stretch my imagination to think it could have happen.  For example, if Michael had decided to donate some of his time to the homeless as was the case in the end for Drake and Sweeney, this story would have made more sense.  Or, if Michael had built or purchased a place/s for the homeless and talked other lawyers across the USA to donate likewise in their states, it would be believable.  The character, Michael could have gone through all of the metamorphosis that he did in his investigation of the homeless and in his discovery of the working of the small office where lawyers worked for the homeless.   Michael could also have talked his firm Drake and Sweeney into volunteering some of their time as well.  <br />As this book is written, I enjoyed the read as it was refreshing to read what happen to Michael.  But to state that he opted to live in an apartment without furniture and eat from a \\"greasey spoon\\" simply because a homeless man forced him to recognize the status of homeless people is ridiculous.<br />Yes, do read this book and form your own opinion.  And for me, maybe I should write my own book if I want to control characters in a story.  Beverly C. Sanders	2003-02-01

From that hypothesis he decided that he could use the mold and its sporos to develop a new drug for the 20th century to cure personality flaws.<br />The story was driven by greed from the money to be had from the new drug/s and Dr. Armstrong's desire to be the doctor of the 20th century.

Now if you are looking for a heavy-weight book, then look elsewhere.  I selected this book without reading the reviews on amazon.com and I am glad I did for if I had listen to the unhappy reviews I would have missed out on this wonderful book.<br />I am not put off by a story talking about what to do with $3 million+ found on your parents property.  Simply put, I'd spend it as would most any of the other readers of this book.  But, Grisham's character Ray Atlee--professor of law and son of Judge Reuben Atlee (who left the money at his unexpected death without notifying his sons of the money) has to deal with the legality of the money since he knows the impact of such a find as a professor of law.  I am thoroughly convinced that Ray was doing the best he could in solving the puzzle as to what to do with the money.  <br />Give this book a read and I am sure you too would appreciate the struggle Ray underwent before arriving at the decision you or I made right off the bat.  Diffrent strokes for different folks.<br />As for Grisham  deviating his writing style to provide us with this delightfully quick read, I say thank-you very much.

I loved the storyline as it revealed some of the undersides of being an attorney for both the plaintiff as well as the prosecuting attorney (state).<br />This story addresses what is supposed to be a typical day in court but it  turns out to be an atypical day in court.

I always think these kinds of stories are far more interesting than fiction. <br />Aline lives in Spain with her Spaniard husband but was a spy for events in Morocco, Africa. Now she lives in Marabella (southern Spain) which is just over the Mediterranean Sea from Morocco. Her travels take her to many other far and distant places like Las Vegas, Nevada, Paris, France and many other very interesting places. <br />Countess Aline tells about the life and death of about 10 or 12 people that she was spying on. She and her husband were attacked several times also but escaped each time. Her job was to spy and report information she found back to the USA in HOPE to foiled any attempt to kill the King of Morroco. Aline does not do very much like most spys. And, she does not prevent 3 different attempts to kill the king. Although the king survives, it was not do to anything Aline does. Truly, Aline would have been more effective working as a travel agent as she did a very good job of moving from one continent to another. Give this book a read and see what you think.	2002-11-07

Therefore, it is very fearful that our nation has grown in its abuse of the use of illegal drugs.  If we do not curve this illegal drug use or prescription nerve stimuli medication, it will be the undermining of our nation.  Naturally I did not like the theme of this book, but, this book did bring to light the story that some of us Americans live out each day. I would recommend the read of this book for an educational enlightment but not for information on how to abuse drugs.

B.) what a wonderful murder mystery, love story and legal documentary this book was.  <br />Kendall was the perfect heroine I would like to have been if I were to have been in her shoes.  She was smart, beautiful, successful, loveably, and down right \\"on time\\" regarding the realities of the government's \\"witness protection program.\\"  Having served as an attorneyin private practice and a public defender, she was well prepared to tread through the legal system to reach her own satisfaction to her dilemma.  <br />The book opens with Kendall surviving a tragic car accident.  From that point forward, I was spellbound to the story.  Some of the most incredible things took place in her short work career as an attorney.   She goes from a happy attorney in a large legal firm to being an individual who was in need of legal representation for her own life experiences.  During the course of time, she meets a man, falls in love and marries him, and attempts to live happily everafter.  However, kismit did not have happily everafter in its plans for her.  The book tells about the many situations Kendall undergoes before coming full circle with taking matters into her own hands.<br />I have given this book the highest rating that I have ever given because that is how much I loved the storyline, the protagonist and antagonist, the plot, the setting and the reality of the entire story.  Why, Kendall could have been the neighbor next door.  As for you S. B., keep on writing.   Some of us reach the top only after a concerted effort.  Your effort is now paying off--this book was copyrighted in 1995--by now you should have sent to press several other successful hot novels.	2002-10-22

THIS IS THE 1ST of Shannon Drake's books that I have read and I also did not read her editorial reviews before reading this book.  Therefore I did not know this book was about vampires.  Had I known, I would not have selected it.  It was not until about page 100 that this book began to hint of vampires but it still wasn't clear until the last 1/4 of the book.  Needless to say,  I was not happy to discover such a fate for this book.<br />Had the storyline stayed with its first 100 pages, the reader would be happy to accept Drakes novel, as a beautiful city, a beautiful love story, a beautiful Jordan Riley and Ragnor, a beautiful Carnivale, and, a beautiful opportunity to give her readers a history of Venicel <br />Truthfully, I could not force myself to read many of the pages about Ragnor's vamps and skipped much of the information about Jordan in New Orleans as it really was very uninteresting.

I thought his voice was perfect and it made me feel like I was right there in the story living out the story as he read it.  Now is that a reader or what?  Coupled with the grand master's story by DeMille, you have a formula that cannot be beat.  DeMille, if you are out there you should have Duke read all of your books.<br />I absolutely loved the story.  Can't you see Cory, the seen it all, lived it all, been everywhere and know it all trying to stay away from the underworld of crime while he recuperates.  It just cannot be done.  So, it was only natural for someone to come along and breakup his boring rest period.  Had it not been friends of his, he still would have jumped at any chance someone may have teased him with to flex his \\"I am superior\\" detective muscles.<br />Corey brings a bit of lightheartedness to the story that may not have been able to be obtained without him.  He also brings a good bit of detetive savvy along as well.  <br />During a time when we are undergoing so much attention about chemical and bioterrorist warfare, this book could not have been better timed.  I learned a lot about some of the horrors of bio-chemical warfare.  Let us never forget.<br />I must say, however, I was really surprised that right at the beginning of this story upon finding the scientists dead, Demille wrote that the scientists had to be up to some harry-carry.  DeMille quickly moved the story along to prove that these scientists were not selling the USA out to the enemy but were seeking fortune through another less threaten route.  I learned a good bit about lost/found treasures and how one can become the rightful owner.	2002-10-12

It was very interesting how each decided to call a truce for the sake of their carnal cravings and then it was back to the above.<br /> Even though I liked this book, I must state that there were some things in the story that challenged my imagination.  For example, Corinne decided to marry Jared after he raped(day) her for sake of giving the unwanted child a name.  Corinne was a very rich girl and could have married anyone of her suiters who had not raped her and he would have happily given her son his name.<br /> Also. she travels from her home town in  Boston to completely accross the United Stated to Hawaii just to keep an eye on Jared who deserted her after consummating the marriage on their wedding night.  Jared was not the hero I wished he would have been, but it was necessary for him to have been just what he was.  Corrine was not attracted to any of the gentelmen that she knew but Jared's cold ruthlessness really turned her on. <BR> Another thing that exceeded my imagination was that Jared did not recognize his baby son borned to Corrine when he looked at him.  The son, Michael, was a near mirror image of Jared yet poor Jared was not able to see the similarity.  Corrine, therefore refused to reveal to Jared that the night he raped her the son Michael was conceived.<BR>Despite all of the above love developed and they lived happily ever after.

The writing is good but there is no plot, no mystery and nothing interesting in it. Now we know that you did not really write this book. It is clear that the person who wrote this book was the one who lived it, TRACY. As for a storyline, this book did not have one. The events and action simply were not believable. Now what is written is meant to be the real life of Tracy but I don't believe it. Most of all, Tracy did not want to hint that she was anything like what her life was in Flyy Girl (early teen) that she over compensated and made out like she spent most of her twentysomething years without any real man in her life. Additionaly, she states that she became a millionaire while about 28 years old and after only about 3 years in Hollywood. By then she was writing, starring and semi-directing roles for herself and others. Sorry, not believable.	2002-03-15

It is written very clear and concise.  The story or life of the 29 members in this book is different from most of the African Americans who were brought to the American shore starting 1619. It is noted that Phyllis Wheatley was brought to Boston, Massachusetts around 1761.  She became a poetess after learning to read and write. She was quite lucky to have been allowed to learn to read and write as most of the other slaves were not allowed that priviledge.  She is noted to have had published her first book of poems in 1773 when she was about 22 years old.  The book goes on from there enumerating the discoveries and firsts that 28 other African Americans participated in up to the 21st century.<br />I recommend that every child as well as adult read this informative book of American firsts	2002-03-11

I loved how she weaved the love story around the surprise death of a resident in Witt's End.  How about the name of that town?  Right away we should have known that some strange things were going to happen in a town with the name Witt's End.    Basically, everyone in that small town were at their wits' end.  The town was dying unless someone gave it a \\"shot in the arm\\":  and, a shot it got, opening of a mail-order company for the products they offered.<br />They say, opposites attrack.  It sure was true in this book.   Who would have expected the big-time businessman to fall for a strange lady of unconventional qualities from Witt's End.  His doing so demonstrated that he too was at his wits' end for relationships.  He gambled away his rich family inheritance for this free-spirited lady.  In the process, he  relives his childhood years and discovers he never was treated like a real member of the family and that his lost was really not a lost at all but it was a enlightment and a gain.<br />The mysterious Witt's End held secrets of its own but when discovered one-at-a-time those secrets constructed a bond with that town that could not be ignored.   <br />Krentz, kept me interested right up to the end and I am sure you will be too.	2002-01-29

Alexandra, as a new attorney, under the pretext of wanting to bring a murderer to justice, returns to her original hometown in Purcell, Texas.  She reports that she must find the person who killed her mother in that town 25 years ago.  As you can see, the chances of being able to find sufficient evidence to prove a 25-year-old murder is too preposterous.  Therefore, I must adopt the position that I have taken on this storyline.<BR>  <BR>As soon as Alex arrives and meets the sheriff of that little town,  she pines to go to bed with him.  She also falls for two other of the suspects.  Throughout the more than 400 pages of text, she tells about her exploits leading to bedding the sheriff and about subsequent  bed rattling episodes.  In the end, she gets the man and decides that the roust she use to divert the attention from her scheme, really was not so important to her after all.  Alex lived the first 25 years of her life with her grandmother and without her deceased mother or her absent (deceased) father.  So, naturally she yearned for a male figure in her life.  The sad thing is that she did not seem to care that she was probably sleeping with the man who killed  mother and that he probably would kill her too just to keep his secret.  A hot-shot attorney she was not.   She kept the deepest, darkest secret of them all.  Read about the town-people in Purcell and see if you believe she took her professional duties seriously or used her position as a cover-up for her carnal cravings.	2002-01-12

Most of us have little knowledge of the eveyday life during that time so Robards did a good job of researching her subject.  Religion plays a big part in the family life of a southern preacher.  His four daughters are who the story centers around.  Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart.  The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate.  Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms.  This was a quick and interesting read.  It has a wonderful twist on the prince charming subject.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about southern comfort, history, sibling rivalry and the rags to riches theme.	2002-01-08

Gunn has whole-heartedly tried to write a story about a little rich girl, doing little rich girl things and going to places little rich girls go.  Why is it that I found her character Jaz unbelieveable?  Jaz lived in expensive places, went to expensive schools brought expensive houses, cars and other toys yet her source of income did not come until she was over 30.  She trained to be a doctor, but changed her mind and then trained to be an architect which is when she began to earn a living.  How she survived before that is unclear.  Family did not support her, so how? Reference was given to royalities from music by family members but not at the level that she was living. Lacking critical information like this, made it difficult for me to believe this meant-to-be believed love story.<BR>  <BR>Jaz was shown as so knowledgeable about everything and everyone.  She was a study in over-confidence.  How could someone so omnipotient  be so naive about anything regarding the realities of war?.  She met Qwayze, fell in love, married; he went off to war and was killed in action.  Jaz refused to face reality.  What are you suppose to think about such a person?  The story tells about the extravagant lifestyle she led in pursuit of finding her Qwayze.  The sad thing about her was she did not know him when she saw him.  Love is suppose to transpose such superficial trappings she possessed.  Well, if you are interested in reading about an attempt by a well-meaning author to place a Black family in the shoes of the rich an famous, then give this book a read.  It truly was entertaining, but just judge for yourself as to the believeability of it all.	2002-01-04

I WANT EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA to read this book because this book helps to correct the socialization dysfunction which we have casted upon the females in our society.  We socialize our girls to think they should give-up their dreams of being one &quot;self&quot; once the woman marries.  This is an egregious error.  Based on our divorce stats alone, most women will have to raise  her children and support herself at some time in her life after marriage.  It would not be in women's best interest to giveup all that make them able to  maintain competitiveness in the marketplace, homeplace and social register when they know that those instruments  are their insulation to the predicment that Samatha found herself caught-up in.<br />As in the animal kingdom, the female must fend-for-herself.  If it can be done in the human race with a mate, then, well and good.  However, women must always reserve their ability to manage the load all on her own.  Samantha is a perfect example of the average wife in America.  She has devoted her entire adult life to supplying the needs of her family.  She, absentmindedly, forgets that as an individual in that family she, too, must see to it that her needs are met.  Rather, she masked her individuality to a point that so many wives in America have done. Result, the sad story that is told in &quot;Open House.&quot;  What is even sadder, is that this senerio is repeated across America millions of times.<br />I want each female to take a real close look at the characters in this book and see if you can identify a plan in your life to avoid having to repeat this story.  If this can be done,  Elizabeth Berg, has more than exceeded her expectations in changing the American culture in this short commentary on marriages in America.	2001-12-08

It is a relaxing read and doesn't require one to devote a lot of mental power to understanding the message.  As a female, like most of my gender, I am interested in the fashion world.  Goldsmith, in this tale, gives a key-hole view of the fashion world as it were at the time of her writing.  The fashion world has changed a little since then, but, not much.  Models still starve themselves, or binge then purge, or manage their health through a good exercise and food intake program or are naturally thin.  Message her is THIN IS IN.  Hopefully, the readers are motivated who choose this profession to follow the healthy approach and not the obvious unhealthy ones.  <br />As long as we follow the practice of clothing our bodies in our society, we will be concerned about what we wear.  Now I give the provision of wearing clothes because from what I am seeing in our society today, we are wearing smaller and smaller amounts of clothing. The tiny tops and bottoms that are in fashion for the ladies and men, border on returning to the Tarzan and Jane era--meaning very little clothing.<br />Karen Kahn does a sizable job of revealing to us the competitive nature of her the fashion designing profession.  Weave into her workworld are the pressures she faces in her private and/or home life.  For her, home life was not very good.  Her husband, sister (half), and mother (adoptive) all had contradicting programs which made for little harmony for her.  Facing pressures from home life and work life make for a pressure cooker environment. Sooner or later something must give. Now many of us, who live in the real world, have experienced or are experiencing such a pressure driven environment and can identify with her plight.  Thanks to her, we now know we can work our way out of that sick environment and live a healthy life ever after.<br />I love heroine stories and hope Goldsmith keeps them coming.	2001-12-07

At last, someone gave us some serious commentary on what it is like to be Black in America. Let us never forget that there are factors bearing on African Americans that do not exist for any other race of people in America. Now, no one expected that this book would be a know-all, tell-all but it sure did cover a lot of areas. <br />What I would like to see this book and any other book by these authors-convey Iife seen from the Black point-of-view. Trust me, one needs to always know what the other may be thinking. How are you going to know if you do not read and study about them. In America, the society is structured to reveal what the majority in our society think and have not given much serious thought to what other may also be thinking. Woo is he. <br />Millner and Chiles took on an awesome task of travelling where no man had travelled before. Their tome is insightful, informative and creative. What is needed now is for other African Americans to get up off their butts and write and create that masterpiece that they are sitting on and share it with America. The time has truly come for them to take the driver's seat in designing their own  destiny.	2001-12-03

O mightly spirit, direct her path and bless her every footstep for the world is beholding to her. The lesser informed among us would have you believe differently, but, research would prove my characterization of the Black Woman.<br />The 150 great women mentioned in this book did not include your mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, etc, but it could have if you are of African American decent. Please know that this author could only write about a limited number of women who have left an indilible impact on society. In 1619, only the&quot; biggest and baddest&quot; Africans survived the death-trap journies across the Atlantic Ocean in those filthy slave ships. They arrived here with their African names--no wonder some of the women were identified as unknown by name because their slavers had't forced them to adopt another European name by that time. The slavers surly were not going to call them by their rich African names. Those barbaric slavers were skilled in dismanteling one another as they only knew barbaric behavior. Culture existed only in Africa in 1619 and not in Europe or Asia- -which is the homeland of the slavers. <br />Bolden has done an outstanding job with this book and, if you are smart, you will surly put this book on your &quot;must read&quot; list.<br /> It was a joy and pleasure to read about some of the women of a bygone era that I   already knew about or learned about for the first time.	2001-12-03

I want to thank you for creating the heroines that I love to LOVE. <br /> NOW, we all know that  Steve should have taken his behinds on out to California with Meredith when he first insisted that she take the job--to make all that big money that she willingly shared with him--when he was making only pennies.  He knew his wife was faithful but she was also human.  He delilberately pretended that he could not do what any other devoted spouse would have done, and that was to accept  employment in his field with the first hospital that offered him a position after his big job offer failed-- so he could be with his wife.  But no, he claimed he could only accept employment that would have resulted in a promotion for him.  Well, he got just what he deserved.  Meredith finally gave in to her emotions and so did he--results, divorce.  That will teach men that they cannot have one set of rules for themselves and another for the women in their lives.<br />DANIELLE, like all your love stories, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Cal was just too much of what Meredith needed and vice-versa, they were destined to fall in love and live happily ever after. <br />DANIELLE STEEL, keep on spiting out your books as your stories take us where we  cannot go ourselves--but get there nonethelelss, vicariously, thanks to you	2001-12-01

To be Black and to succeed in North  America meant to succeed against all odds. Those Blacks; therefore, were far ahead of anyone not so siimilarly situated,  ergo, the title of this book should have read Created Superior.<br />The story of the  Songhai People chronicles the history of Africa eons before the invasions from Asians and Europeons.  This is important to relate because at that time in history, Black people were the leaders in education, the arts and science.  People came from around the world and sat at their feet in hope of gaining some of their knowledge.  In the 13th century, the beautiful city of Jenne (the one with 12 gates into the city alalulah) was founded.  Similar cities like<br />Timbuktu (Sankora University), Goa and Walata preceded Jenne as the centers for education.<br />Enter the invasions from the  north (Asia and Europe)  then enter their inflictions of BRAINWASHING and  slavery which brought some of Africa's best and brightest to these American shores and you have the mental fiber from which many inventions were created.  Some of the inventions presented in Created Equal, no doubt, were developed by people who were in the Imhotep (who was the true father of medicine) lineage and various other great African educators, artists and inventors lineage.<br />The book, Created Equal, talks about how difficult it had to have been to have had their  inventions and discoveries stolen from African Americans.  But, what this book also shows is that inspite of all that was done to keep Black people down, their genius overrode it all and they surfaced the winner over and over again.<br />What the book should have stated was that Blacks in America, since he beginning of time, has fought in every war that the US has participated in and has been the winning force in most of them.  Blacks fought in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the war against the American Indians, the Boston Massacre, World wars I and II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war the Desert Storm war and now the war in Afghanstan.  Even as this ink dries, Blacks are still striving to improve their lot by still participating in fights for freedom in hope that they will earn  entitlement.

You cannot put it down.  And, when you reach the end you say, &quot;more, more, more&quot;.  Have you every wanted to kick the butt of an author who left you hanging.  L'Amour has done just that in this one.  Although one gets the impression that Noon rides into the sun happily everafter,  I want more details.  For example, did he marry Fan?  Did he return to El Paso, Texas or did he decide to go off into another direction?  Did he continue being a gunslinger or can one ever change from such a background?  The questions go on and on.   L'Amour should read this review and quickly get started on a sequel.  What do you think?	2001-11-21

The title would more appropriately read- Listen little girl and I'll tell you a story.<br />An abbreviated history of  Black folk in America is given.  Since the book is only 20+ pages long, you know not much history can be told in those few pages.  However, what is shown is very good.<br />I am most impressed with the fact that this book gives a serious  picture of Black people in America.  The Ilustrator, Jerry Butler,  needs to produce books on his own as his pictures make the book.  Every picture is packed with so much reality I thought I saw myself on one of those pages. Every house on the planet should read this book and dust-off a place on the bookshelf for this book.	2001-11-21

TERRY MCMILLAN has flexed her creative muscles again and may the heavens open up for her in the same manner as it did for her in her famous tome, &quot;Waiting to Exhale.&quot;  What a wonderful talent she has which sets her apart from the crowd.  While everyone was trying to duplicate (cash-in on) her style in her previous book-turned movie gold-mine, she busied herself with an entirely different format.  For the children of today who enjoy toys that reinvent themselves from being a frog to being a supersonic jet, they can easily accept the new-stylied McMillan in this masterpiece.   Beyond age 12 however, we find it to be amazing that such a transformation can and, in fact, has taken place.  I guess it is hard for us to believe that an old dog can have new tricks. <br />McMillan's tricks sure make me laugh.  Her writing style in which she mixes characters thoughts with their conversations force you to not realize where the thoughts end and the conversations begins.  The characters are larger than large this way.  I found myself laughing over and over  as Cecil and Viola slipped in and out of the pages leaving  the very essences of their being. God bless their sweet soles.  I am called to relate the characters in this book to many people I've encountered and I am SURE you will be able to say the same.  So, if it is a good laugh you're in need of and easy reading, do pamper yourself with McMillan's reflections on how life is in the real world and laugh at yourself when bits and pieces of your life appear in her print.

Extrasensory Perception is a gift from God, therefore, I feel gifted to have been chosen to be a recipient.  <br />I try to use my gift in only productive ways and, for the most part, have limited them to my own person and family use.
