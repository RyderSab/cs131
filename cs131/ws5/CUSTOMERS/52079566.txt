A bit dry and heavy in parts. I don't know a lot about postmoderism but am learning, as many of the people I read and write about are postmodernists. People seem to rave about postmodernists but even though some are maybe out to lunch which is bad because they have responsiblilities for the disabled as psyhciatrists, they have some interesting points for thought. Don't get blind sided by postmodernism, study first year calculus at least in your fine arts degree.	2002-08-10

But this Mathematical Statistics book we covered in two terms later in my school/math career after having some experience in goverment statistics work. I had trouble with the term work taken from this book. But I was able to score B in the exams in these courses by studying hard from the book itself, not much else, besides some biographies/histories of the statisticians themselves. The professors that use this book generally don't stray from the book too much. The second half of the book in our courses is not done linerarly. I will be repeating the courses this year on the way to grad school. I don't find it that hard to read when I put in the time. At other times it seems very Greek and dry. It is a very slow read but then that's science for you. I am developing a word processed file with all the answers to the text's problems for my own use. Certainly I understand that outcomes of experiments is the subject of the book. I also see how the book does the math ground work behind applied statistics. But is this the real world? It seems like psychology it does not make common sense. Mathematically the book takes some proper preparation. But as one math book I have worked through and will work through again this year I am impressed.	2002-08-05

Of course, programming all night long is a drag. It is nice to see that this guy made a job of it. Not a bad book on Linux too from a philosophy point of view. It is already helping me to write about law and voluntary regulation of the net and to learn a little bit more about Linux.<br />Unionise the high tech sector now!<br />I don't know why people think this is a business book though it is more like sci-fi entertainment, I think.<br />It is easy to read that's for sure.	2002-06-01

He has fun faking his identity in a chat. What happened to being honest and not lying to people? He talks about Western pioneer spirit ya well we have heard that by now. Must be the WELL because there seems to be a unity in writers from there. And yes their story dominates too much of the writing about the net. Sorry but I like community I am not a libertarian, thank you very much. It was an interesting read my own grips about the WELL aside. But then we could all write something like this but as a story of one person's personal views on the computer explosion in America and the media business it has merit. Since Bill Gates seems to be known for his relation to computers I guess this writer got to know his subject. I didn't finish it but it has some personality.	2002-04-18

I was only interested in regression, when younger, as this seemed to be useful in physics labs and in scientific literature. Early programmable calculators could do regressions. But what was behind this mysterious line through the points? This book explains it every way they can think of...there are so many ways they apply the simple y=mx+b that once you can master the line in cartesian space the rest is easy. I took this book in the two semester suggested way with regression first, ANOVA second. I did very well with these course and got a stats degree. I am very fond of this book now. Yes, my data diskette was corrupted at one point and I did have to ask our professor to make me a copy. I also agree with another reviewer that the examples are good. These allowed me to learn about the application areas and remain critical of the models. However, I can see that this book could confuse some and it is very expensive. Also I agree that when solving the later problems in the book one has to flip back to the first occurance of the dataset but if your working on a computer this isn't really as much of a problem. But it is still a problem because you have to know what variable is what. A favorite school book? Yes it is.	2002-03-31

It is a good attempt. Yes, it follows many of the current writers in sociology on cyberspace(like Castells) and the so called information revolution which I live everyday. It also looks at work and Taylorism well. I can't find any faults with it really. But does he do the title justice? I think, yes, he covers the sociology of work and the ideas of being replaced by a computer well. I also think he attempts to break out of the mold of much of the unoriginal writing being done on cyberpsace these days in the schools. He doesn't seem like a hipppy as one other reviewer noted. I don't get the idea that Perelman is a libertarian living on the West Coast nor do I think he is rich. He does seem to be an academic economist though. Good work Perelman!	2002-03-31

Lovely little find with personal touches and thoughts this book is cool. Now, I am involved with the green party in Canada and have often thought art serves politics. While the book is not political it does focus on trees. I never have  written a poem about a tree. These authors do it well. One can submerge in the green and wooded sublime with this book. I highly recommend it to environmentalists and others needing to see some focused poetry. Personal relations with nature are well expressed. I know I'll be buying more copies of it.	2002-02-22

Series 1)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Great for teens good for adults	The reading level allows an adult like me to read this book in a day or two. It inlcudes the typical information one would find in an adult book. Namely that these drugs were causing deaths in the 60's and 70's until they were then prescribed by the doctors with more care. The problems these pills solve are real enough and one gets a good look at the problems. The chemistry of the pills is also explored and could make a good book for a bio-chemistry student to get going on applications. Also investors in bio-tech might benefit from reading books like these as a first step to understanding the business.	2002-01-10

If you need to see a story set in the Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0 setting then this book seems to fit the bill rather well. While the politics in this book is dated we need freedom of expression and maybe the author is a left explotiationalist. I can see the teens now getting involved in left wing politics only to find the TV is their legislature much as I do as an adult. As far as computer fiction it fares well but remember it goes with a game. As the other reviewer I rate this book based on it's fitting into the context of the game cyberpunk 2.0.2.0 and not on literary standards. It is a cheap read yet at that it is a quick read too. BTW it is low on romance content and a little too full of violence content.	2001-12-21

For one installing a printer took me through three sections with very little information just a sort of run around. I did get my printer installed but it is isn't complete. The Word Perfect 8 is not on the CD as far as I can tell it is a free download but Corel no longer offer it and the company that took over the Corel OS have nothing yet made. Now I find the OS provided very good and the book was fun and relaxing to read. I haven't finished it and I agree with another reviewer that it goes into depth on topics but I think generally it is a bit thin on important configuration of hardware issues. not a bad book I would recommend it if you need to install Linux OS on a Windows hard drive.	2001-12-21

I read it again in high school and started to grasp more than the word paper tigers. I understood the idea of party politics and it helped me do well in high school political science. Later in life reading it invigorated me along with the bible I started to rebuild my life. I became a left wing survivalist. Now days I think I can see the bitter truth's of idealism mixed with blood and guts that was Mao and his experience. It still inspires me but I would hate to have to believe in it, in it's reality, considering the pain and death behind it. I think it shows that military minds around the world at all ends of the spectrum keep good discipline and we should fault soliders only for ending lives early and causing suffering.

This book was also titled the bird of paradise, but is not the book the other reviewer thought it was, that was also a book by RD Laing but with another author and also had the word *family* in the title.

I read this as a course book in Iain's course, and then bought the first edition in the early nineties.  It taught me to research the literature of geographic economics well but not clearly.  I had read it with a few socialist books on Poland and other command economies.  It brought my trust in capitalism to life as well as opening my reading to socialism and social theory.   Covering systems at various scales and in a geographic example type format with small maps and breakdowns of labour and supply,  it illustrates,  the differences of the world's nations.  Some of the connections between these nations and the theory of finances is of course, confusing.<br />  Until we realise that global as a word does not belong to Wall Street but to the people of the earth,  we will not get straight talk.

Bruce jealous or an absorbed researcher?<br />  So it's true if a simple programmer who gets in trouble,  and likes the sex pistols, will be criminalised by capitalist authors who will write books which are fun to read.<br />Nice cover Bruce, are you libel to me?<br />I couldn't finish this book,  the section on the grateful dead computer advocate was the last straw, showing the biases in the writing.<br />So while I don't like the implications,  it's not bad for education and as a computer security book it was cheap.	1998-07-02
US	52079566	RF5WFXENQS9YH	0226746992	909642633	Physical Climatology	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Experiments, what experiments?	I read this book in 1987.  It was a course text book.  I loved the feeling I got knowing that I was reading about warmth,  rain, snow and the like all caused by energy of our sun and it's distribution.  Although, our school could not support any student experimentation and the labs we did were all on paper,  the book conveys a global view.  Forget marketing,  turn on the weather network.	1998-01-22

A good read written by an IBM director in France.	1997-12-21

It covers chemicals well and describes the experiments that provide the text with truth and relevance.  I had read standard government soil classification schemes and also advanced soils books after reading this book cover to cover. I applied the laws of soils well in other science courses.  I recommend it to student or farmer.	1997-12-21
