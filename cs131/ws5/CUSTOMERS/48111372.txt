To tell the truth, I read more information about this case and the now famous BonnyLee in the tabloids while waiting in the grocery line than the 2 hours I spent reading this poor excuse of a book! And the only reason I continued to read this book after the first boring chapter was because I knew if I put it down on the coffee table, I'd never pick it up again!  The author obviously was out to make a quick buck.  Why else would anyone write this poor excuse for a book BEFORE the main subject has even been charged with anything!  As we know, most authors write about a murder AFTER the murderer has been caught.  Even O.J. books were churned out by the dozen after his trial.  Not before!  Everything Gary King wrote about could have been read in the tabloids, public records, newspapers or on the internet.  All he did was combine public knowledge into this silly book then charge us (...).  What a ripoff!  My advice?  Don't waste your money.  The National Enquirer has a much more interesting layout each week than this joke of a book.	2001-11-11

Grabbed this book in a hurry while on jury duty for a murder case no less.  Absolutely loved this page turner.  Della (Dante) made me cringe as I read each chapter of her man-filled life.  A woman who in my mind, definately had some mental problems.  Aphrodite Jones details how 'Dante' used each man in her life for her own advantage then turned on them one by one.  If you life true-crime stories, this book is for you.	2001-11-09

Generally, I find the subject of Hells Angels to be entertaining but this book was an exception to the rule.  Anthony Tait manages to make Hells Angels seem totally boring but if the truth be told, Anthony Tait is the most boring subject I've ever read about.	2001-11-05

As a fan of true crime books and having just spent 3 weeks on jury duty at a murder trial, I grabbed this book after reading the back cover and discovering Dana Sue Gray had killed in similar ways as the trial I was viewing.  This lady is one of the rare documented cases of women serial killers and I had goose bumps as I read about each horrendous murder.  Unlike some nonfiction crime books, this book was a page turner from start to finish.  The book details how Dana would steal her victims credit cards and go on shopping trips after her dirty deeds. It also tells how Dana constantly lied to detectives when she was finally picked up for her killing spree after her own step-mother grassed on her!  If you're the type of person who enjoys reading a book from cover to cover in one sitting, then this book is for you.	2001-11-05

Being the mother of teenage children, this book really hit home.  The book is a nonfiction about a teenage couple who manage to fool not only themselves but their parents, doctors, friends and many others into ignoring the fact that they are about to become parents.  This book gives graphic details about Amy's pregnancy, dorm life, daily worried life, eventual labor and delivery of her baby, disposal of the baby and the horrendous aftermath.  It also details how Brian, Amy's boyfriend, handles the crisis and sends a stern lesson out to young folk.  I fully recommend this book and although it's shocking, I think teenagers would receive a strong message about unprotected sex and the consequences.	2001-11-05

I knew it was only a matter of time before she caved in and righted all the wrongs which were quoted in the many books written about her and Elvis preceding her own. It took ten years but she finally wrote this book, Elvis and Me. I was waiting so earnestly for this book because I felt that Priscilla was probably the only one close enough to the 'real' Elvis to tell us the true background details of day to day life and I was right in my opinion. I felt this book was raw! Priscilla didn't mince words or try to coat the truth. She told it as it happened, in true detail. Priscilla starts her book by telling us where she was when the news of her ex-husbands death reached her. Her book then goes back to the beginning. Her first meeting with Elvis in Germany. How Elvis wanted to &quot;see her again&quot; and even ended up visiting her parents to make this happen. Although the book is filled with the many tender moments she spent with Elvis, it's also a shocker when you learn of his drug dependency. A pill to sleep and a pill to wake up! His many 'hanger-on's' who were constantly at his side whenever he was awake. His free spending ways towards friends and family to the almost abusive way he took over Priscilla's mind and body. She lied constantly to her parents we find out. Especially when she was visiting Elvis for vacations. Elvis thought nothing of telling Priscilla's parents one thing then totally doing the opposite. Then there's the fact that he refused to have sex with her until their marriage night and how it completely stopped after Lisa Marie's birth. Just reading inbetween the lines of this book, you can tell how frustrated Priscilla was. She had everything yet her life reached a point of such emptiness and dispair with Elvis that she left him. Priscilla doesn't leave anything out which surprised me a little. She tells of his numerous affairs during their relationship, his strange habits,and just when you think there couldn't possibly be anything else to talk about, she shocks you with yet another revelation. Do I think you should buy this book? Yes! Do I believe everything in the book? No! Either way, I think this book is the closest we will ever get to the true Elvis. Priscilla was the closest to Elvis we will ever get so if you're an Elvis fan, this book should definitely be part of your Elvis library. I think you'll be quite shocked at some of the things you learn. I was!	2001-08-25

I work at a very well known hospital in the suburbs of Boston in a department where medical terminology is a must! Having had no schooling on this particular subject, I was asked to enroll in a course at the hospital specifically for staff. I paid for this book by Ann Ehrlich on the first day of class and have to admit, gasped when I saw the thickness and content of the book. Not having any background on this subject, I expected to have an extremely hard time picking the terminology 'lingo' up but I was in for a pleasant surprise! This book is not only very easy to follow and understand, it's also perfect for a person who is being introduced to the medical world. After a few months, some of the longest and most complicated sounding words are rolling off my tongue. I even amaze myself when I say them! Considering this book is a mandatory part of the hospitals class which consists of hundreds, I'm not at all surprised why they chose this book as the main tool. Yes, we have a doctor assisting us with the words along with the book but I truly believe I could learn this information alone. The book is that clear and easy. So, if you find the need to learn medical terminology and are not as lucky as me in being offered a free class, I'd recommend you buy this book and learn it yourself. This is a book that my hospital has used from edition one according to the instructor. Quick learning at your pace!	2001-08-24

Having taken a medical terminology class at the hospital where I work, I quizzed the instructor on a suitable medical dictionary in his opinion that I could use for my daily work needs. He suggested a few including this one. Next day in work, I was about to ask a few of the many people in my department what their preferences were but decided to take a stroll around the cubicles instead. Sure enough, nearly every cubicle I passed, held a copy of this dictionary. After purchasing a copy, I wasn't surprised to see why. The book is very easy to follow and understand so, if you find yourself in need of this subject, I'd definitely recommend Taber's.	2001-08-24

I really don't think you need to be a &quot;political junkie&quot; to read this book in my opinion!  I certainly am not and I thought the book was excellent!  A very entertaining account of one man's run for the big office.  Of course, before I even picked up the book, the press had already suggested that this book was based on Clinton and I can certainly understand why after reading it.  Anyway, it was an account of day to day happenings as Governor Jack Stanton hits the campaign trail.  So much of the book reminded me of Bill and Hillary that I began to imagine them as the title characters.  I'm giving the book five stars for the enjoyable read, not for the topic.	2001-08-12

Figured I'd write that title so people would know what this book is about because I certainly didn't with a title like Trainspotting!  Firstly, I read a couple of customer comments and noticed a lot of customers complaining about the Scottish 'lingo'.  Personally, I didn't have a problem with the accent being British with Scottish grandparents but even so, my book had a translation list in the back so I'm wondering why people didn't use this as a guide?  Anyway, Irvine Welsh has written a riveting book about heroin addicts and their everyday life. Wow! Talk about a hard-hitting book!  The characters were quite vivid in my mind throughout the book as the narrator, Renton, tells his account of life in a junky existence.  The energy pouring out of each page is riveting!  I was actually bouncing off the walls along with the addicts at some points.  The parts I really found interesting and amazing were the accounts of how they 'scored', how they paid for their drugs and all of the different drugs they would use for a high!  The toilet chapter was vivid too.  This book is intense and is not what I'd recommend for a lot of people I know, but if you like reality books and can manage the Scottish dialect then I'd recommend this book.  Beware; it's graphic in some spots.	2001-08-12

Doug is a retired ice hockey player due to an eye injury, which made it impossible for him to play the game anymore.  When he is offered the chance to be a figure skater  with a girl who is seeking a new partner for competition, he's not interested at first.  He ends up accepting the offer and it turns out that his partner is nothing but a spoilt prima donna who is a bad tempered brat used to getting her own way by constantly throwing tantrums.  Well, it seems the reason she needed a new partner was because she had driven all of her old partners away for some reason or other.  She nearly achieves the same with Doug but he hangs tough and gives back as good as he gets.  Through a lot of ups and downs, smiles and tears, Kate and Doug are at the Nationals but are barely talking after a huge fight but, all ends well when Doug tells Kate just as they're about to enter the ice rink for the final contest, he loves her! There are tears, on screen and off, then all ends well!  This was a great film.  Yes, it was a little predictable and the story was a little thin but for a Sunday afternoon sit-a-round, it's a very entertaining movie.  Not to mention that dish, DB Sweeney!	2001-08-12

It's about a boy named Garp and basically, the world around him.  How he handles things as he grows up.  His mother, Jenny Fields, is a very strong character.  The way she conceived Garp is very 'strange' as you'll see when you read the book but thats the way she wanted it.  Garp is extremely close to his mother probably from not having a father figure except in his imagination from the stories Jenny told him about 'dad'.  Anyway, the book is funny and sad, strange and normal.  Take Jenny for example, Garp is a writer yet Jenny is the one who writes a best-selling book and because of the books content, she becomes a marked woman.  The part I really liked was Jenny's house, which becomes a home for strays!  She has people wandering all over the place.  One person I was particularly fond of was Roberta (Robert) who used to be a basketball player, had a sex change and thus Roberta. There is also a group of women who live at Jennys house called the Ellen James Group.  This was very sad for me.  Garp just can't understand these women and why they did what they did.  Ellen James was raped and the rapist cut her tongue out obviously so that she couldn't talk and tell.  So, this group of women cut THEIR tongues out thinking they are helping the cause when all along, Ellen James is distraught about these women who she doesn't even know, doing this act.  I don't want to give too much of the story away.  There are some very amusing parts of the book too.  One involving a run-a-way plane and Garps NEARLY new house but you'll have to buy the book to find out about that.  This is a page turning, gripping and very entertaining book.  I recommend this book fully!	2001-08-11

So, don't buy this book expecting to read something as frightening and gripping as Peter Benchley's Jaws which as you know, was a blockbuster book!  The Deep, although sometimes slow in sections, is a story about two people (a man and a woman) who are deep sea diving for treasure.  While on the ocean bed, searching for artifacts which they've heard are supposed to be down there, they accidently come across thousands of little glass vials which seem to be filled with some kind of fluid.  From there, the story is more of an action movie between the good guys and the bad guys.  Yes, it is written in the same Benchley style as his other books but it just doesn't have the kind of 'pull' that Jaw's did.  Even so, I would still recommend it as I would all of Benchley's books.	2001-08-11

This may sound silly but I often wondered if Mister Wells had a time machine!  His stories were/are years ahead of the time he wrote them.  Some of his stories make one wonder if he indeed had a peek into the future!  Doctor Moreau! A strange man, alienated from British society because of his illegal experiments.  (More like weird experiments!)  This rather small book, tells the tale of our mad (?) Doctor, inhabiting a secret island where he can continue with his experiments.  He has found a way to breed man/animal creatures creating some of the weirdest species ever!  Eventually, a stranger finds himself on Doctor Moreau's tropical island with no way off!  As the story unfolds, the man finds out about the Doctors experimentation with animals and is horrified tremendously!  He thinks the Doctor is a nutter to put it bluntly and is extremely scared of the unknown. The Doctors work is undoubtedly flawed though because his 'creatures' are a tad unhappy and therefore need to be controlled by the good doctor. The `happy conclusion' tells us, don't fool with mother-nature sir, or else!  I recommend ALL books written by Mister Wells. He was an extraordinary man, way before his time!	2001-08-11

Thinking back to about 10 years ago when I read the hardcover version of this book, I just picked up a copy at a sale for my daughters to read.  I think that even though this book is about a 'big fish' that likes to dine on humans, it is a classic in that category if you know what I mean.  I remember when this book first came out.  People actually stopped going into the ocean after reading it because it was that convincing!  Peter Benchley's imagination goes full blast in this tale of a police chief and his family who live on the Cape in Massachusetts.  The story starts with a heart stopping attack of a girl who goes for a midnight swim then becomes our 'fish friends' first human meal.  After that, you can't put the book down.  We then read about the frustrating world of a Police Chief who is getting absolutely no help from the town committee and he has to deal with this massive beast roaming the town's waters.  I usually wouldn't recommend a book with so much bloody content for a teenager but seeing as they've probably seen the movie version anyway, this is quite good reading which is why I grabbed it ten years after reading it myself for my two teenagers.  Even though 'Jaws' has lost some of the clout as when it first came out, it's still a great book, well written and entertaining.  So, even after ten years, I fully recommend this great book!	2001-08-11

Definitely a book for teenagers but beware if you scare easily!  This book is about teenage vampire boys who live in a cave near a pier and fairground.  They come out at night to feed their cravings by charging at groups of kids having parties on the beach or an unsuspecting night guard walking to his car after his long shift.  The story revolves around two boys who have just moved to the area with their mum and are living with their grandpa.  The oldest boy gets involved with the vampire gang after spotting a very pretty girl who happens to be 'involved' with the vampires too! This book is for teens so, as a mum, my review is a mum's opinion.  I think this book is okay for a teen to read as a fun book.  They couldn't possibly believe anything that goes on in this book such as flying vampires attacking each other from different corners of a dark, dark room.  And who is their leader?  I will never tell but you will be very surprised when you find out!  In the meantime, the younger boy has met some vampire fighting friends who set out to destroy the vampire gang with typical vampire gadgets such as crosses, garlic, salt, mirrors etc.  Only problem is, none of it works. I found myself laughing at this book.  All in all, it was well written and I'd recommend it for your sons and daughters.	2001-08-07

This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it!  My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it.  I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls.  They loved it!  Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them.  They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls.  You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord.  Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies.  They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed.  They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them.  They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay.  Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside.  So, back to the book.  Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures.  Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives.  You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind!  I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder!  No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book foryour teenagers or just read it again yourself!  In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book.  Please read it!  As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on....	2001-08-07

First of all, I wasn't sure if this 'Lost Boys' was the one I'd read only because I read it many years ago and have since donated it to my daughters school library.  I wanted to write a review about it though and have checked all of Mister Gardner's other books which really seem to be in the same line of this book type.  The previous review seems very unfair to me.  I can understand writing a 'quicky' review but it's obvious to me by looking at the first review that the person never read the book and obviously just wanted to win the money for the first review.  This seems very unfair to me and I plan to write to the appropriate people about this.  Sorry, but it makes me mad when people sit and read a book from cover to cover, only to see silly little sentences that tell you absolutely NOTHING about the book in question.	2001-08-07

I'm well known for swiping my two daughters school books especially if they're classics as was this book.  Of course, I read it when I was younger and the thrill of seeing my girls reading the same book made me want to read this wonderful book again.  It's a wonderful story about a young girl, Mary, who becomes an orphan while living in India with her parents so she is sent to her Uncle's manor on the Yorkshire hills in England.  She starts to ramble around the big old house and soon discovers her sickly cousin, Colin, who is being fussed over and treated like an invalid by the servant.  Without spoiling the story for you, they find a secret garden, which is an absolute mess.  Overgrown and unkempt for many years.  The garden was once tended by Mister Craven's wife (Colin's mother) who has since passed on.  The story revolves around the children's adventures in the garden and amazing things start to happen.  Colin finally walks without the aid of his wheelchair and Mister Craven makes a sudden trip home to the manor only to find the children in the garden.  He has been extremely down and his heart broken since his wife died which is why he had locked the garden as his wife was the only one who tended it.  The story is very deep and is actually a story of healing, joy, tears and finally facing ones obstacles. All stemming from an overgrown garden!  Well, that has always been the way I've envisioned this story.  But please read it for yourself and make your own judgment.	2001-08-07

I completely forgot reading this book until another Amazon reader wrote me with a question which jogged my memory.  I read this book after finishing the complete dollanger collection.  When I had previously read Garden of Shadows, I remember feeling as if the book had in no way been written by VC Andrews because of the wording and technique.  Then when I started reading this book, the same feeling came over me again.  I guessed the ending not too far into the book which is not usually the case when reading these books.  I have to be honest.  I found it boring and couldn't wait to finish it!  Even my two teens who had both swiped the Flowers in the Attic series from me with delight, turned their backs on this book after a couple of chapters.

I've been trying to read up on all books connected to the Jon-Benet murder so this book was a must according to reviewers.  As expected, Lawrence Schiller took the readers through the murder events and clues, step by step, making a clear picture in our minds about what occurred during the murder and investigation.  As usual, Mister Schiller's book was jam packed with details I was hearing for the first time.  He is also a master at clearly laying out, each event/murder clue in such an order that we find ourselves realising we know who did it!  This was the case for me and several of my friends who also read this book as we passed it along to each other.  I already had a fair idea in my mind of who I thought may be strongly involved but after reading this book, I was certain!  If you are following this case also, and wish to read a book that is accurate, helpful, clear and to the point, then you must read this!

I've read this book too many times to remember so, I read it yet again the minute she left the house!  An all time classic which will always be a part of a schools reading list in my opinion.  This tale is about a group of teenagers who are growing up in less than perfect conditions.  The story is narrated by 'Ponyboy' who feels there are only two groups of people in the world.

The movie, although excellent, left me a little empty inside because I needed to know if the whole story had been told correctly.  We all know, nine times out of ten, the book version of a movie is usually more accurate, has more detail, more events and incidents, more detail about the characters in the background such as parents etc., and is much more realistic.  It was true with this story too!  The book did turn out to be much more revealing and I found many incidents in the book which were not in the movie as I'd thought the case would be.  The book is about a real life drug smuggling incident which occured in Turkey.  Billy Hayes claimed it was the 'first' time he'd ever done such a thing but I have heard differently in the press.  Anyway, Billy was caught with a moderate amount of drugs on his body.  The same amount found on someone in the USA would probably result in a small fine if it were the person's first offense.  That wasn't the case for Billy who after being questioned by the Turkish police for many hours, ended up in the most hellish prison with a wide assortment of inmates.  There were even children in the prison who had been caught stealing.  The book is a page turner which describes in great detail, the pure hell that Billy goes through as his ordeal unwinds.  From his many court appearances to his daily problems of survival at the prison.  If this book is true, then Billy went through the worst experience of a lifetime but if he's making the story sound a little more dramatic by telling lies to the reader, then I don't feel sorry for him at all.  He broke the law and the law says, you must pay for your crimes.  The problem I have with Billy's criminal act was the horrendous sentence he received for his crime for being in the wrong place.  I do hope his story is truthful though otherwise, he made a lot of money off of the book and the movie rights from people like us who believed he'd been to hell and back.  I've been hearing so many contradictory statements concerning his book that I have been wondering about it.  Either way, whether you saw the movie or not, this book is a fantastic, page turner which will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Then when you've read the book first (which I wish I'd done), then rent the video and see the movie!  Talk about heartstopper!	2001-08-04

More like 1 1/2.  I never saw the movie so I have no idea which is better but if the big screen version was the same as the book, then I can understand why my friends said it was terrible and don't bother seeing it.  This book was boring from page one.  I'm one of those people who have to finish a book once I start reading it so I had no way out but to read to the end.  The main character comes across as a complete nutter to be honest.  A lonely nutter at that.  He decides to befriend one of his customers who really wants nothing to do with the cable guy.  As much as he tries, he can't rid himself of him though.  And that's the whole plot of the book!  Pretty exciting huh!  NOT.  Don't bother.  Unless you see it for a penny at a yard sale.	2001-08-03

I was ready to shove this book in the back of my cupboard by page 75ish because it was so bloody boring!  I don't know why I kept reading but I did and I'm so thankful I did now!  James Dickey definitely has a unique way of writing.  In this book, he tended to detail EVERYTHING in the beginning.  By this, I mean, he detailed things so much that I was nodding to sleep!  If you can get through the beginning pages of this book, then you're in for a thrilling ride!  The book is about 4 men who are out in the deep woods for a canoe trip until things get a little disrupted when they are interrupted by the natives who don't take too kindly to them.  Pick this one up!  It's worth it!	2001-08-03

I always prefer books over movies so having seen this excellent movie a billion times (more or less), I decided to read the book.  Talk about being disappointed!  If I hadn't seen the movie first, this book would have been discarded after chapter one but instead, I just kept reading and hoping the story would pick up eventually.  Alas, it just dragged on and on.  I wonder if Mel Gibson read this book before making the movie?  If he had, I think he would agree, his script is way off Mister Wallace's version of the event's which took place in Scotland.  A lot of people who reviewed this book seemed to like it but I can only be honest in my opinion by saying I didn't like it and I suggest you stick to the movie version just for the action scenes alone.	2001-08-03

My teenage daughter brought it home for an assignment and lacking anything to read, I picked this up and finished it in one sitting!  It is a little on the immature side for an adult of my age but, for a teenager, this is a funny, valley girl book.  It's about a young lady named Cher and the book is about her daily mishaps, her friends and the ups and downs of a rich teenager living in Beverly Hills.   My girls usually 'moan' through their reading assignments because the books are usually &quot;boring&quot; but I was amazed to hear chuckles of laughter while this book was being read.  I'm sure they were wondering why mum wasn't inquiring about their laughter but then again, why should I?  I'd already read it!  Mum's and dad's, this would make an excellent birthday, xmas gift for your teenage girls.  Great book!	2001-08-03

If you like fantasy books (although, this actually could be happening for all we know), then I recommend you pick this book up asap!  The title doesn't tell us much, the back cover tells us a little more but as soon as you get into this book, you won't be able to put it down.  Briefly, the story revolves around a young man named Richard who is given a map by a stranger of a so-called secret community living on a beach in Thailand.  The story revolves around Richard and two friends, travelling to Thailand in search of this secret paradise.  That's where all the excitement starts.  This book is a page turner from beginning to end.  I felt myself rooting inside for the trio to find the secret hide-a-way so when they actually do, then it really gets exciting.  You will enjoy this book immensely!  If you like fantasy's that is. ;-)	2001-08-03

The Krays were London's version of the mafia and the Krays ran the biggest 'gang' before they both went to prison for life after being convicted of murder.  Ron and Reg were twins, born in London in 1933.  They grew up with the 'perfect' mother and somewhat of a lay-a-bout father yet after meeting the wrong type of people, they turned to a life of crime and violence.  This book is both informative and interesting.  How much is true, I have no idea seeing as it wasn't written by an actual Kray.  Everything in the book is second hand.  From unknown sources.  But it does make interesting reading and I've heard a movie of the book was made with Charlie Kray's okay (Ron and Reg's older brother.)  So, I can only assume the book is close to the truth if it was endorsed by Charlie.  But, I think the reader has to make their own mind up.  This is a good book and I do recommend it but I personally think it's a book for adults.  That's my opinion.	2001-08-02

Lawrence Schiller is a master at digging up every single bit of information in his books.  From reading just his book, I learned every single thing about this case including things I'd never seen in the press.  He obviously did a great deal of research before putting pen to paper.  His book made me wonder about certain incidents in this case that I'd never even thought of before.  If you have been following this case as me and several million other people, then this is a must read book.  Out of every book I've read so far about the Jon-Benet murder, this book has been the best!	2001-08-02

It's a beautiful love story about a short affair between a stranger and a lonely married Italian woman who fines herself alone while her family attend a fair.  The stranger stops for directions and from that moment, a whirlwind love affair occurs.  Don't be fooled by the title into thinking the book is a detailed description of our countries bridges.  The stranger who is a photographer, is taking photographs of local bridges for a magazine which is why he's in the area and thus the title of the book.  I'm not usually one for sloppy romance novels but in this case, I found this book to be a caring and loving account of two people in deep love and having to part company.  It's very sad.  I recommend it.  It's much better than the movie of the same name.	2001-08-02

I decided to watch the movie when it came to the big screen just to see if it was as frustrating as the book.  As it turned out, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  If you enjoy reading military type books with a lot of military type talk then this really is a book for you.  Personally, I plan on sticking to the straight talk, everyday kind of books I'm used to.	2001-08-02

We hear about such fasinating things as Fartman's antics to his political era which I'm sure will go down in history.

Unlike the movie of the same name, this book is the funniest page-turner that I've purchased in a long time. The story takes place in the English countryside where a widow finds herself penniless but with a huge pile of bills left by her husband.  She is about to loose her house when she comes up with a plan along with her gardener, to grow pot in her greenhouse.  She has a 'greenthumb' and therefore has no problem cultivating the 'stuff.' The book is about all the ups and downs as she grows it, tries to keep it hidden, tries to sell it and many other very funny events.  The book has a 'twister' ending which would be a spoiler if I told you so I won't.  I fully recommend this very comical account of a granny with money problems and the delightful town she lives in with all of it's very amusing characters.	2001-08-01

It's not very often that I find a movie better than the book but in this case, I'd have to give the movie and the book 5 stars but on the other hand, the book has far more detail and although you know what is about to happen if you have seen the movie, it's still very suspenseful and has you on the edge of your seat until you turn the last page.  Michael Crichton is a brilliant writer who has no problem writing about entirely different subjects.  I mean, what do dinosaurs and female sexual harrassers have to do with each other?  Either way, this is a must read book for your collection and I fully recommend it.	2001-08-01

Because of all the bad press and tabloid rubbish about this whole Amy Fisher episode.  So, like millions of other people in the world, I tended to sway over to Joey's version of the story but after reading this rather deep and interesting version from Amy's view, my mind has definitely changed somewhat.  Amy does not belittle Joey as he has constantly done with interviews about her.  She also writes about her childhood and is very truthful about being a prostitute etc.  She was deeply in love with Joey by the sound of it while he was obviously just using her for his own pleasure.  Although Amy did a terrible thing to Joey's wife and I am not excusing her from this, I can now see how she was just an immature kid in lust/love with Joey and this was the only way she could honestly see her and Joey being together forever.  As we all discovered, Joey is nothing but a liar.  At least Amy has been truthful from the start.  I'd recommend this book just to get the real facts and not Joey's blown up version of events.	2001-08-01

Although I obviously didn't buy this book for my own personal reading, I felt I should write a review considering I'd personally read and re-read this book at least a hundred times for my two daughters.  This book had me and my two children laughing our heads off with it's many silly stories and antics.  It took the old fashioned fairy tales that we all grew up listening to and turned them into a much more modern version.  I wasn't surprised to see, my children preferred these new versions to the old ones and to be perfectly honest, so did I!  I don't ever remember laughing at fairy stories when I was a child so it delighted me over and over to hear my children chuckling away at each well written tale.  I recommend this book for 5 and up personally.  I feel younger children may be scared by some of the characters but that's my own personal opinion.  Mum's, your best bet is to check it out at your local bookstore before purchasing.  Great book!	2001-08-01

JP was a hard book to follow in my opinion but Michael Crichton managed to pack as much suspense into this sequel as JP.  I only gave it four stars though because although the book was very well written and extremely scary, even though I hadn't seen the second movie, I guessed what was going to happen before turning each page.  It was as if the story was predictable from the start.  I have no idea if other people felt the same way as me.  All I know is, when reading JP, I was bouncing around all over the place.  The Lost World, although an excellent story, wasn't as gripping to me.  I still recommend you read this book.  Especially if you're just a Crichton fan.	2001-08-01

Apart from the many differences such as Novalee being afraid of the number 7 (it's the number 5 in the movie), there is much more detail and a lot more events in the book.  I doubt they could have fitted Novalee's packed life into a 90 minute movie anyway.  My daughter brought this book home from school as an english reading project.  As soon as I picked the book up and read the first chapter, I was hooked.  This book is well written and great reading for teenagers I think, because it lets them know being pregnant and alone isn't so easy.  The movie tends to make Novalee's life look easy.  As if everything drops into place for her but this book is much more realistic.  If you want a 'can't put down, page-turner' then I fully recommend you read this great book.	2001-07-31

The book was fantastic reading and was jam packed with a lot more detail than the movie of the same name.  So, if you thought the movie was good, then you absolutely must read this book.  You're be happy you did too because the book is more involved in the people's lives.  After reading this book, I was compelled to visit the fisherman's statue in Gloucester, MASS which was placed next to the sea in memory of all the fisherman who have passed away while fishing over many years.  Knowing this book is also a true account of a freak storm which took the lives of these men, also makes it such compelling reading.  I fully recommend this book.	2001-07-27

He wrote it because Princess Diana had just accomplished having a best selling book secretly written about her by Andrew Morton and Charles wanted to make the public believe that he was the victim and not Diana as he so often points out in this poor excuse for a book.  All this book manages to do is show us what a sniveling wimp Prince Charles is.  We get to read how he was constantly harrassed by his father, Prince Philip, as he was growing up.<br />What he doesn't tell us is the story of his affair with Camilla while still married to Diana.  He also doesn't tell us about the constant verbal and mental abuse he imposed on Diana by making snide remarks about her weight issues.  Even though I only gave this book one star, I'd still recommend you read it if only to see what a whining liar Charles actually is.  Since the death of Princess Diana has set so many records straight especially about his constant belittling of her (which is not in his book), his boring life style which she had to put up with day in and day out (which he doesn't mention in his book) and many other things, this book actually makes me sick because now we all know what a bunch of bull it actually is.  And if the truth be known, Prince Charles married Diana for one reason and one reason only.  He needed a baby machine and Diana was perfect for the job per his dad, Prince Philip.  THIS fact is also, NOT in his book!	2001-07-27

In fact, I gave it a grand rating of ONE star!  So when I saw this book, Second Act, on sale at the local library, being a glutton for punishment, I decided to read it.  Well, I was happily surprised as I turned the pages and read an entirely different Joan Collins.  This book was extremely entertaining as Joan told about her very eventful life.  All the famous people she worked with.  I had fully expected another bunch of dribble like her first book which was filled with 'poor ol me' stories about her husbands screwing her over but this book turned out to be the total opposite.  Maybe Joan learned by her first disasterous attempt at writing that it's not at all easy to be a best selling novelist as her sister Jackie is.  This book was obviously researched and edited a lot better than her other one.  So, I will give it three stars and if you're a Joan Collins fan, then this is definately a 'must read' for you.	2001-07-27

Glen Rogers, the killer, fascinated me.  He is good looking, and could easily be mistaken as a softie or even my big brother but he's actually a violent mass murderer who traveled from state to state, barely being missed by police on the look out for him.  Once, he was even taken into a police station for a different reason than the violent murders he had commited but unknown to the police, they just let him walk free.  This is an 'edge of your seat, page turner' and the only reason Glen was even caught, was because he spoke to the wrong person about his crimes.  I recommend this book fully if you enjoy true crime.	2001-07-25

It seemed to just 'cut' right to the end leaving out a lot of needed detail such as why Frank Abagnale decided to switch over to good guy.  The book was brilliant though.  I couldn't believe the things he got away with.  From being a check cashing pilot WITH a crew to a doctor with (thank God), an excellent nurse to help him, every page of the book had you wondering if he would be caught.  Then living a year in a dirty, filty Italian jail with no clothes and a smelly bucket that was cleaned out twice a year which he used for bodily function, it was very graphic.  In the end, I didn't want Frank to be caught even though he was a con artist.  From teaching us how he conned the bank by changing the numbers on deposit slips to flying a plane for free, this man was honest in his book and taught me a thing or two.  I would recommend everyone read this book just to see what actually is going on outside in the REAL world.	2001-07-24

I'm so glad I read this book before I saw the movie because I probably wouldn't have picked the book up after seeing Sharon Stone, Dustin Hoffman and the other stars playing the parts so unlike was portrayed in the book.  That's just my opinion though. The book was definitely 10 times better than the movie with the portrayal of strange huge squids above the undersea station and other fantastic, mind boggling happenings that can only happen in a book.  Things that special effects can't even make up for a movie.  The book was spine chilling to the point that I felt as if I were in the seastation with the crew.  The story is about a strange sphere that appears in the deep ocean.  I don't know how everyone else read it but I felt the writer was trying to convey to us that the sphere was not from outspace at all but was from the future and had actually been made in the USA.  I'd still give the movie version of this book 3 stars but I implore you, if you decide to see the movie, read the book first!  Great story, great plot, great writer as always.	2001-07-24

I never read this book when if first came out even though I was really 'into' the OJ case like millions of other people. Then, last year, I read the book he wrote about Martha Moxley. I was totally stunned to see what a fantastic writer this man actually is!! So, I decided to read this OJ book. I learned more in Mark Fuhrman's one book than I learned in every other book out on the market concerning the trial. Once again, Mister Fuhrman's book was easy reading. He went into every detail of the evening step by step. He also hand drew little diagrams and information included with photographs which made me understand the scene of the crime a lot better. He also shared with us, many pieces of evidence that were omitted at the trial and his feelings towards many people associated with the case. By the time I reached the end of this book, instead of being 50% convinced of OJ's guilt, I was now 100% convinced. I even wrote Mark and begged him to write about the Jon-Benet murder. Since he wrote about Martha Moxley, a man has been put on trial for this act, mainly due to Mark's evidence from the book. I would love to see the same thing happen if he wrote about Jon-Benet. Great job Mark!!	2001-07-24

I read the book in two days, glued to each page as the Dollanganger's finally escaped the attic and began an adventure in the outside world.  Chris was obviously infactuated with his sister, Cathy and although we all turn our noses up to incest, VC Andrews seems to make it appear normal with her writing ability and way with words.  When Carrie becomes extremely ill on a bus, Chris and Cathy realize she needs a doctor pronto and that is when they end up meeting Doctor Paul Sheffield.  After this meeting, all kinds of things start happening for them.  I turned each page with exciting anticipation as to what would happen next.  Although Andrews will never be able to write a book as fantastic as the first Dollanganger horror of being locked in an attic for four years, this followup is very good none the less.  If you do decide to read this book, you must read Flowers in the Attic first so you understand the whole story.	2001-07-24

To say this book was exceptional reading, is an understatement!  I could not put this book down.  It was filled with facts that were not in the movie and I found myself laughing and crying as Henry Hill told his story.  The end was very sad.  Reading as Henry ratted out all of his mafia friends.  I just heard about Henry Hill on the radio.  Picked up with drugs.  His wife divorced him after 20 years and I believe he no longer has protection due to his criminal activities. Anyway, my advice is to read this book!  Excellent!	2001-07-24

Betty Broderick spent many years supporting her husband while he attended law school.  When she finally had the perfect life after her husband became successful, she continued to aide Dan by hosting his many business parties, taking care of the kids on her own because Dan was TOO busy to attend their sporting events.  Yes, Betty was a little immature for her age but she never stopped giving her love and support to the family including Dan.  Dan was obviously having a mid life crisis when he purchased a fancy open topped car and started having an affair with a young co-worker.  When he finally 'dumped' Betty, some deep counseling was obviously needed and who knows, she may not have ended up being a murderer.  This book is very well written, very interesting and fact filled.  I feel both Dan and Betty were to blame for the events of their lives.  No, Dan didn't ask to be shot but then, Betty didn't asked to be dumped and pushed to the side like an old chair after it's served it's purpose and is no longer needed.  I fully recommend this exceptional book.	2001-07-24

I wonder how many men have actually been sexually harrassed out in the business world but have been too embarrassed to step forward for fear of ridicule from their fellow employee's?  Michael Crichton handled this situation wonderfully showing how one man's world is knocked upside down because of such a happening.

I usually love reading books such as this one but although the book started out as a page turner, it quickly ended up on the lower shelf of my bookcase, the last third unread, for a few months until I finally picked it up just so I could file it away!  I will not start another book until I've finished the one I'm reading so I had no choice but to read the ending.  Unlike the beginning 2/3's which were exciting, amazing and extremely interesting, the end of the book was surprisingly dull and boring.  The court section dragged on and on and it was so predictable too.  Everything I guessed would happen, did!  If the whole book had been as entertaining as the first two thirds, I would have given it 5 stars and recommended it highly but the author blew it with her rushed last part and very predictable ending.	2001-07-22

Only fair because I read Loni's book last year and was curious to read his version of events.  Burt's book is good.  I will say that, but, he has the biggest ego ever!!  The book was entertaining at the beginning.  I loved reading about his childhood and growing up years.  Burt can be a very funny man.  The parts I didn't like were when he started being snippy over Loni.  How she spent hours putting her makeup on.  How she wore a skimpy bikini around the poolman.  (Why shouldn't she?)  Loni never once put Burt down in any shape, form or manner in her book whereas Burt seemed to think it was okay to nitpick about her every chance he got.  Burt, other than the low-blows you wrote about your ex-wife, the book was very entertaining.  Please try to forget the past as Loni has and get on with your life!!	2001-07-22

After reading a few chapters, I felt a state of confusion every time I began reading it. Being a deeply religious person, I tend to 'believe' Christian people who insist they're not liars!!  This way of thinking was drilled into my head by my parents. So, when the Ramsey's kept insisting over and over they were innocent, that the Boulder police were useless, the media were liars and made life hell, they were true, honest Christian's etc. etc., something clicked in my head. I noticed the book was filled with ME, ME, ME or US, US, US.  Hardly nothing was written about their other children or even Jon-Benet.  The whole book was focused on John and Patsy.  The pure hell they'd been through from giving pubic hair samples to being slandered on the web.  I then realized this ignorant duo were simply whining their way through a 'poor me' book either for money or simply to drop names of people they disliked.  People who 'abandoned' them at their time of need.  These rich folks weren't about to allow old friends to desert them without some name-calling.  They did the same with the Boulder police, media, web and many other people who were only doing their jobs.  Nobody forced them to read the newspapers, tabloids or enter the web to read Ramsey sites!  Even though I gave this bull one star, I recommend you read it so you see for yourself a pair of talented actors.  Remember, when you buy this poor excuse for a book, the Ramsey's will receive your hard earned money.	2001-07-22

I'm not a big John Grisham fan but I must admit, if I'm seeking something to read and am having trouble, I will wander over to the Grisham section.

Okay, when this book first came out (when Diana was alive), I would have  given this book a much higher rating because it was obvious to all of us  that she wanted the facts of her life to be known and had given Mister  Morton permission to write it.  But, I never read it back then.  I read it  a few months after her death and have to say, although the book was  informative and obviously could not have been written without Diana's help,  the only reason Morton re-released it with her handwritten notes was to  make a buck.  He could care less about her tramatic life.  She would NEVER  have allowed him to openly admit she was behind the book.  By making this  fact common knowledge, Morton made her look bad to her boys, her family and  basically, the world!  I thought James Hewitt was a bit on the low side but  Morton is an even slimier lowlife in my book!	2000-09-14

The man deserves to be heard considering the slanderous way the press has  been treating him so I read the book and I have to say, I did enjoy it.  I  knew nothing about his military career or Diana sending him packages to the  Gulf.  I think the book is well written and informative.  If James wrote  this book for the money then shame on him for being a lowlife BUT, if he  wrote this to set the record straight as he claims then I don't see  anything wrong with it.  Freedom of the press!  How about freedom of the  public!

Even though he was greeted in Greenwich with hostility and no  cooperation, under these difficult conditions, he still managed to turn out  a spellbinding book.  I can't wait to read his other book, murder in  Brentwood.  And I'm also thrilled that this book helped bring another  Kennedy relative to face the law for his crime.	2000-09-14

Kidding aside, I love these Hollywood series  of books but I can not get into the Lucky series.  I read one book but  haven't picked up anymore in the series.  I do recommend this book.   Extremely entertaining.  Very funny in some parts.  I wonder if the wives  are really as Jackie portrays them?  It's funny.  When I was putting faces  to the characters while reading the book, I kept putting JOAN Collins face  on everyone...ha ha.  Enjoy this one.	2000-09-14

Even though the story is really far fetched, this book is by far one of  Mister King's best novels ever!  I mean, finding a space ship in your back  yard isn't a very common occurance so I was shocked to discover how  entertained I was by this book.  I couldn't put it down!  Another  masterpiece by Mister King.	2000-09-14

It was an actual chore for me to read this book.  I only kept reading because I was hoping the story would turn around  somewhere along the line and become entertaining but it never happened.  I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this book to anyone because I didn't enjoy  it at all.	2000-09-14

This book was gripping from beginning to end and I'd recommend this highly.  Like all of Grisham's books, it starts off throwing out details for us to absorb and in this book, a sudden thrill as the main character is picked up and tortured but that's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the book for you.  The book continues to build up and up until the final bang at the end.  I never saw this ending twist coming at all which is unusual for me.  The final ending knocked me off my feet with surprise.  If you're a Grisham fan or just enjoy surprise endings, then this is a 'must-have' book for your bookshelf.  I fully recommend this exceptional book.	2000-09-14

If you read this book, you must read it's sister, Desperation.  It's strange how King uses the same character names for two entirely different books and two completely different set of characters. If that last statement totally confused you, then I suggest you read the books and you'll fully understand what I mean.  Actually, it's very clever.  King's mind always seems to be ticking over, seeking strange and clever twists for his many books.  I fully recommend both of these books.	2000-09-14

I think if  Mister King could cast Kathy in a majority of his movies, they'd probably  all be hits.  Although, I have to say, I didn't see him make his usual  cameo appearance in Delores unless I missed it.  This book was truly  heartwrenching.   From start to finish, you're wondering WHY!  The daughter  obviously has some deep seated problems and it's nice at the end of the  book when she goes back to aid her mother in court.  Another hit book by  Stephen followed by another hit movie by Kathy Bates.	2000-09-14
