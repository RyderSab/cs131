But unfortunately, this book is extremely poor as a novel.  It is lengthy and tedious, and I felt like drinking soup diluted several times with water.  It contains several interesting matters such as a guilty conscience of the scientists for creating the dreadful weapon, but they are described only superficially and not appealing at all. <br /> <br />And the characters are all dull and flat, especially Connolly, the protagonist.  It might be a little better if he were a mechanical narrator who just reported the life in Los Alamos to readers.  But he artificially displays his \\"personality\\" with an abrupt adultery.  That makes the story increasingly diffuse and boring. <br /> <br />I won't accuse this book as a complete waste of time, because it let me have a glimpse of the inside of Los Alamos in WW2.  But I feel terribly frustrated why such an intriguing subject could not become a better novel. <br />	2005-05-15

What is more, Mom's reasoning is backed up by her deep insight of human beings.  She reveals people's weakness, foolishness, sadness and so on.  That adds the stories depth and warmth.

Kyra, the adult daughter of billionaire Jake Rynerson, is kidnapped.  Simon is retained by Jake to deliver the ransom.  However, it is highly possible that once the kidnapper gets the money, he will kill not only the hostage but also the courier.  What is worse, the suspicion arises that someone close to Jake works with the kidnapper.    The first half of this book was rather slow-paced, but the latter half was extremely thrilling and I could hardly put down the book.  I love the first novel \\"The Courier\\" better because of several small reasons.  For example, the hi-tech gadget of this book is much enhanced, but I like the familiar Internet technology of the first novel better.  And I find the subject (the fatal diet pill) more intriguing and the characters (especially Retnuh, the psycho villain) more interesting in the first novel.  However, that's just a matter of my personal liking, and I highly appreciate this second novel is not a rehash of the first novel.    One thing dissapoints me.  The last chapter is dated on Monday 24th November 11:08 and the epilogue is dated on Monday 24th November 05:53.  I expected this time-back would have a significant meaning, but the epilogue is just a later-on story and the time-back seems to be a simple misprint.  It's a killjoy.  I don't know who is to blame, but please be more careful.	2005-04-14

In 1941 during WW2, Klaus Felsen, a German industrialist, is forced by Nazis to take a command of the tungsten procurement operation in Portugal.  In 199*, Ze Coehlo, a police inspector, investigates a murder case of a 15-year-old girl in Lisbon. <br /> <br />The idea is very interesting, but I am quite disappointed.  This novel is too artificial and it lacks weight and/or depth as a grand drama of a half century.  Coehlo's story is tedious and Felsen's story is hasty.  Especially, I lose interest when Felsen, a likable man in the beginning, turns into a savage brute too rapidly.  It might be a little better if his change were described more slowly and carefully.  And the conclusion may be elaborate, but it is too artificial. <br />	2005-02-13

Hoch.<br /><br />Jeffery Rand was originally the head of Concealed Communications (Double-C), the section in charge of codes and ciphers in British Intelligence.  He retired in 1970s, much earlier than his retirement age.  After that his adventures continue, sometimes summoned for special assignments by the Service, or sometimes accidentally involved in incidents.  Now his after-retirement stories outnumber his Double-C ones.<br /><br />This book is concentrated on Rand's adventures with Leila, an Egyptian archaeologist and later his wife.  But I also wanted to read why and how Rand had retired from the Service.  Especially, I am disappointed that this book contains no stories about Taz, the Russian friendly enemy whose death seems to be the main cause of Rand's retirement.<br /><br />Though the selection is rather unsatisfactory, each story is highly enjoyable.  The stories contain various elements such as espionage, whodunit, codes and ciphers, exotic travelogue and adventure.  I wish to read more and more Jeffery Rand Stories.	2005-01-08

This novel vividly describes how human beings with flesh and blood use computers as a tool (not computers use human beings).  Indeed, the classic battle between human beings is very thrilling and exciting.  I would have given this novel 5 stars even without the hi-tech features.  I admit this novel has several drawbacks, but I love an attractive novel much better than a perfect one.  I am eager to read the next book.	2004-06-25

There are few whodunits I want to read again, but this book is the exception.  I read this book second time and I love it again.  It is not only an excellent mystery, but also an excellent suspense story.  The battle against the fiend who commits murders alphabetically is thrilling, fast-paced and highly enjoyable.<br />Reading whodunits, I rarely feel sympathy for victims nor hatred to murderers.

Openings of Mason Mysteries are always strange, but this book's opening is rather unusual.  When Mason has a pleasant time at a night club, he receives a phone call from an anonymous woman who urgently asks his help for a seemingly not-so-urgent matter.  Mason ordinarily tosses away such an anonymous request, but he is moved by the woman's frantic, horrified tone.<br />At last, Mason traces a highly likely woman, but she stubbornly denies that she called him.  WHY?  This riddle is the most interesting in this book.  The answer doesn't fail my expectation.  And the meaning of the &quot;One-Eyed Witness&quot; is not so simple such as the witness has a bad eyesight.  That doesn't fail my expectation, either.	2004-02-14

Openings of Mason Mysteries are always strange, and this book's opening may be one of the strangest.  Mason investigates a hit-and-run case.  An anonymous letter comes to him, which encloses a key of an apartment and invites him to trespass.  Mason feels it a trap, but he visits the apartment.  And incidents happen after that are so rapid, strange and unexpected.  Even Mason gets a little dizzy and incautious, and he makes a serious mistake and gets into a jam worse than ever.<br />But Mason wouldn't waste time to being depressed.  He instantly takes a bold and clever action to upset the triumphant authorities.  That IS Perry Mason!  That makes me laugh and applaud heartily.  And the mystery is very tightly plotted.  It is superb all strange incidents in the early stage are solved neatly and logically like jigsaw puzzle pieces fit in.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-28

The story is painful, but his writing style is smooth and easy to read.  Wladyslaw Szpilman may not be a writer, but I think he is gifted with a writing talent.<br />Szpilman is an ordinary man.  And he vividly describes how ordinary people were helplessly cornered and killed.  I didn't know the life in Warsaw Ghetto had been so cruel.<br />Definitely Szpilman could not have survived without luck and many people's help.  But it should not be overlooked that one important factor of his survival was that he could keep sanity by his cool detachment, endurance and a strong will to survive.<br />The relationship between Szpilman and Captain Hosenfeld is brief but touching.  The epilogue's brief description of Szpilman's frustrated effort to rescue Hosenfeld is also touching.  That symbolizes East Europe's tragedy; the suppression by Soviet soon after the liberation from Nazis.	2003-11-23

But finally I did read it, because I wanted to find out by my own eyes why this book was so badly reputed and how it was different from the previous two books.<br />Now I do know why.  I expected it not so good as the previous books but so-so enjoyable, but I am disappointed.  It's still tolerable that the nice mixture of humor, wit and warmth has changed to a noisy slapstick comedy.  But I can't help feeling something is wrong; the characters's behavior and/or speech have delicately deviated from those in the previous books.  Especially, Beeker has been deprived of his flavor.  For example, Beeker calls the big brass &quot;enemies&quot;.  They are enemies indeed, but it is very unlikely for Beeker to use such a straight expression.<br />It might have been very difficult for any writers except the creator to reproduce the charm of this series.  Or Asprin's memory and/or affection for this series might have faded in the long gap.  Anyway, I wish such a sequel had not been forcedly published.	2003-09-13

This is the first book of Phule's Company Series.<br />The basic story is rather orthodox; a charismatic leader turns a bunch of losers and misfits into a good team.  And Phule's tactics is surprisingly straightforward.  He wouldn't let himself and others to simply label his crew as \\"losers and misfits\\" and he treats them with courtesy and thought.  I thought he would use more extraordinary method because of his \\"rich boy\\" status and his \\"foolish\\" name (he is no fool, indeed).<br />Despite the straightforwardness, this book is highly amusing; sometimes funny, sometimes heart-warming.  I cheer for Phule's Company without reserve.  That is partly because the characters with strong personality are vividly described, and I can feel their presence.  I like many of them; Willard Phule, Beeker, Brandy, Tusk-anini, Super Gnat, Mother and so on. <br />Book 2, \\"Phule's Paradise\\", describes Phule's Company's full-blown activity in real operation and is much more exciting.  I recommend you to regard this book as a \\"prelude\\" and read Book 2 continuously.	2003-08-17

Phule's Company gets a new assignment of guarding a casino.  It seems a sweet duty in paradise, but Phule smells a rat at the smirk of the general who hates him.<br />This book describes Phule's Company's full-blown activity in real operation (rather espionage than combat, though).  It is much more exciting than Book 1, &quot;Phule's Company&quot;.  But that is founded on Book 1, so please read Book 1 first.<br />In this book, the characters display their personality and/or ability more freely.  Beeker is especially nice; long-winded and cynical, but a priceless adviser for Phule.  And Lieutenant Rembrandt, the relatively obscure vice-commander, plays a superb role in this book.<br />This book ends rather cliff-hangingly, but I can't decide whether to read Book 3, &quot;A Phule and His Money&quot;.  Because it seems that Asprin wouldn't or couldn't write the sequel and that the Book 3 was written by another writer, and its reputation is very very very bad.	2003-08-17

Bizarre incidents happen one after another, and superstitious people blame George and his castle.<br />I like \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" TV series and I expected this novelization was also nice.  But I am disappointed.  This book's Jessica lacks the most important quality that makes her successful as a mystery writer and a sleuth; namely curiosity.  Every time an incident happens, she dismisses it to enjoy her vacation.  That's not an attitude of a sleuth.  That's NOT Jessica Fletcher I like.  Just an ordinary amiable lady.<br />And the truth is extremely easy to guess.  I feel that the author deliberately keeps Jessica inactive to lengthen the story.  Indeed, in the last 50 pages, Jessica gets suddenly active and easily solves the mystery.  Disappointed.	2003-06-15

I don't want to write bad things about it.  But honestly, I am deeply disappointed.<br />Paul Cartwright is an English engineer employed by a resource research company.  He visits Romania on the eve of the Ceausescu regime's collapse.  He kills a Secret Police officer to save his Romanian friend, and he desperately tries to get out of the country.<br />That's the first half of the story.  Not so exciting.  The story goes rather awkwardly.  Paul Cartwright, the protagonist, lacks attractiveness and/or individuality; he is rather a nondescript narrator than a protagonist.  But there are several impressive scenes; the killing of the Secret Police officer, the lively description of the Ceausescu regime's collapse, and the wild wetland of the Danube Delta.<br />The latter half is much worse.  Immediately after Paul gets out of Romania, his company urgently dispatches him to Pakistan-Afghanistan border district.  But, what the urgency is, what the company wants Paul to do, where is the final destination ... the story goes on and on about 100 pages without clearing what is all about.  I feel this tantalizing situation goes on endlessly, and I quit reading the book.<br />Terribly disappointed, but I give 2 stars, because some Romanian parts worth reading.	2003-06-08

Maybe best-plotted in the six TCW books I have ever read.  But I don't give this book five stars, because I still don't like Moose County and I feel the development is rather boring.<br />And I feel Koko's sleuth ability is too much in this book, such as Koko gets cold to Qwill who barks up the wrong tree.

However, in Witherspoon's mind, Marvin is already a potential killer, and he strongly inclines to pull them apart by any means.  The young lovers are sensitive and nervous.  And a blackmailer is hanging around...<br />The strained beginning attracts me, the situation which Mason describes as &quot;loaded with emotional dynamite&quot;.  Very well-plotted mystery entangled with past and present murders, and the development is unpredictable.  It's a pity that the climax is not so dramatic.<br />One thing that interests me besides the story; Mason says that arrogant Witherspoon should get jolted and adds that the whole Americans also should get jolted because they take it for granted that they are the strongest in the World.  It is a little surprising that such a statement was written in 1942 when the America was fighting the World War II.  I wonder how American people feel if they read such a statement NOW.	2003-03-05

I have a mixed feeling; I am sincerely glad to read this book, and at the same time I am sincerely sorry to read this book.<br />City of Diamond is an interstellar city-ship of 4-million population.  The basic axis seems to be the rivalry between Diamond and Opal, a sister city-ship, and various characters on Diamond and Opal do various things.  Although the story is rather slow-moving and it doesn't readily go to the main subject (I wonder if it has the main subject), I LOVE IT.  The characters are EXTREMELY interesting and peculiar, and they make the story completely unpredictable.  And the various cultures such as Diamond vs Opal, City Ships vs Outsider, and Outsiders (Empire vs Republic) are also very interesting.<br />The most attractive character is definitely Tal, an Outsider demon.  He is a half-alien, and his kind are always sociopath and are loathed as demons.  For example, Tal recognizes it is disadvantageous for him to betray his supporter, but he doesn't feel it is wrong to betray his supporter.  Meanwhile, he does everything he can to rescue people who work for him from peril.  Understanding his way of thinking, logical Tal is much more reliable and likable than inconsistent human beings.<br />One BIG problem, though.  When the story becomes REALLY interesting, it ends cliff-hanger, leaving several mysteries unsolved.  At the author's web page, she states that she intended this book as a first part of a trilogy, but that health and memory problems have kept her from writing the sequels.  Oh, WHAT A PITY!<br />If the sequels were available, I would buy and read them NOW, even if they were 600-page English books (English is a foreign language for me).

Nobody will call it a masterpiece.  No thrilling battle at the courtroom.  Not so well-plotted as a whodunit.  And Mason does not display his ingenuity of outwitting the authorities (the police and the prosecution) and/or trapping the real murderer.<br />Still this book describes Mason's unchanged attitude throughout the whole series most clearly; even if his client betrays him, he never betrays his client and does everything he can to protect his client.  And the wild character of early Mason is vividly described.  I don't recommend this book if you've never read Mason mysteries, but I bet this is a must-read for Mason fans.<br />The title means the client, a young beautiful married woman who seems to hide her claws under velvet.  She is definitely the nastiest client of all the Mason mysteries.	2002-09-18

They are typical Saint stories; the Saint fights a life-and-death fight with ungodly evildoers on one hand, and tweaks the nose of poor Inspector Teal on the other hand.<br />I liked \\"The Saint and Mr. Teal\\" that was written shortly before this book, but I like this book much better.  All three stories are so unusual and unpredictable.  Fewer dull parts, more twists and turns, and the stakes are much higher.  The evildoers are so-called respectable men and they are more vicious than ordinary criminals.<br />If you want to know what happened to Rayt Marius, the Saint's arch-enemy in \\"The Last Hero\\" and \\"Knight Templar\\", you should read \\"The Simon Templar Foundation\\".  It's about the strange and deadly legacy of Rayt Marius.  \\"The Higher Finance\\" is a rather astonishing story; funny opening, uncanny development, and the climax is so sudden and shocking!  \\"The Art of Alibi\\"; someone takes the Saint's trade-mark in vain.  That's not so surprising, but the imposter's plan and how the Saint frustrates it are totally unpredictable.	2002-08-15

In the foreword, Charteris states that this is the answer to the many people's question how the Saint gains the reputation that he already has in \\"The Last Hero\\".<br />The stories are rather simple and not so unique as later stories such as \\"The Saint and Mr. Teal\\".  But I like them.  Few dull parts and highly enjoyable.  I particularly love the Saint of this era; youthful, gay and lively.  And I also like his amiable and capable sidekick Roger Conway.  It's a pity that he doesn't appear on later stories.	2002-07-31

Not so enjoyable as the previous books, but this is the biggest turning point in the series.<br />Qwilleran is tired of Daily Fluxion.  The managing editor wouldn't let him return criminal reporting, the &quot;modernization&quot; of the office irritates him, and his favorite good old press club has been changed to a tasteless, characterless thing!  Qwill takes a long vacation and goes to Moose County, near the Canadian border, with his Siamese cats.  At the end, Qwill's life changes most drastically; he becomes a millionaire, and he decides to quit the job and to live in Moose County.<br />I'm afraid I can't like this drastic change.  First, I don't like stories at a small, narrow, closed society of countryside very much, and I don't like this Moose County, either.  Second, I loved the surroundings of Qwill as a newsman (the jolly colleague Odd Bunsen, discord with the managing editor, competition with the rival paper and so on) and the urban atmosphere of the previous books.  Nevertheless, I'll read the 6th book at least, because I still love Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum.	2002-06-19

Not easy to read and has countless drawbacks, still it is vivid, exciting and touching.  Homer is a Greek poet and in favor of the Greeks.  Nevertheless he doesn't describe Troy as \\"Axis of Evil\\".  On the contrary, I feel the people of the Trojan side (Hektor, Andromache, Paris, Helen and Old King Priam) are more vivid and human than a little stereotyped Greek heroes.  That makes this epic a sympathetic tragedy beyond vast time and place.<br />This epic doesn't describe the Trojan War from beginning to end.  It starts not from the Judgement of Paris, but from the dispute between Achilleus and Agamemnon.  And it doesn't describe the last part of the war (the death of Achilleus, the Trojan Horse and the fall of Troy).  I felt that was unsatisfactory at first.  But the battle between Achilleus and Hektor is very exciting, and Hektor's funeral is compassionate and touching, symbolizing the downfall of Troy.  I feel now those are much better than the not-so-exciting death of Achilleus (killed by surprise) and the bloody carnage at the fall.<br />Just for your reference.  The episode of the Wooden Horse is fully described in Virgil's \\"Aeneid\\", the post-war adventure of Aeneas, a Trojan warrior.  And if you want to briefly know the whole aspects of the Trojan War, Sutcliff's \\"Black Ships Before Troy\\" is helpful.	2002-06-06

It is very interesting, but not easy to read.  And it doesn't describe the Trojan War from beginning to end.  This book describes the whole aspects of the war concisely and plainly, from the dispute among three goddesses (Judgement of Paris) to the last part of the war that are not described in \\"The Iliad\\" (Achilleus's death, the Trojan Horse and the fall of Troy).<br />This book is too concise to be exciting and/or touching.  But it is a good reference to get a brief knowledge of the Trojan War, especially for a Non-Westerner who is not so familiar with the Greek Myths.  And it is useful to prepare for and/or review \\"The Iliad\\".  If this book interests you, I strongly recommend you to also read \\"The Iliad\\" that is much deeper and more fascinating.	2002-06-06

This is also the first story of the complete family (Qwilleran, Koko and Yum Yum).<br />Qwilleran visits Junktown, expecting it to be a hangout of junkies (drug addicts).  But Junktown is a place for junk (antique) shops!  First modern art, second interior decorating and this time...antique.  Poor Qwill.<br />This book is a little different from the previous two books.  The previous books described prosperous, privileged worlds.  While Junktown is an old deserted town which the City regards as a slum and wants to demolish.  It makes this book somewhat deeper than the previous books how Qwill gradually loves this poor old town.  And this book is relatively well-plotted as a detective story.<br />Unlike Koko, Yum Yum doesn't play a role as a sleuth.  When it hails noisily, Yum Yum gets scared and hides herself, while Koko investigates the noise.  It is interesting that such kind of small daily details show Koko's sleuth talent more clearly.  And I'm quite surprised at what Koko turns on and off...it's just incredible!	2002-04-11

This is an eccentric, outstanding novel, an excellent mixture of comedy and tragedy, full of humor and wit, written by a German writer.  One of the book I love best.  I read it many years ago and I read it again now.<br />The story is mainly in World War II.  Thomas Lieven is a young German banker.  Intelligence agencies of several countries trap him and force him to work for them.  Thomas obeys them superficially, but at heart he never does.  He brilliantly makes a fool out of them.  He is an indomitable pacifist, but not a theoretical, fanatic idealist.  I particularly love his practical attitude; he racks his brain and even risks his own life to save people from bloodshed regardless their nationalities.  That's very brave and nice of him.  I love him so much!<br />What makes this story outstandingly eccentric is that Thomas loves cooking.  He cooks many times to make friends, to dazzle enemies, to find a good idea and so on.  Even the detailed recipes are inserted in the novel.  That's so funny!  Oh, who says Germans have no sense of humor?<br />The title &quot;Es muss nicht immer Kaviar sein&quot; means &quot;It need not always be caviar&quot;.  Not smooth but meaningful.  In Japan, the title is &quot;Shiroi Kokuseki no Supai&quot;, that means &quot;The Spy of White Nationality&quot;.  I don't know the English title.	2002-01-01

Also extremely well-plotted; all independent events converge on the Sorcerer's Stone.  That's very skillful.  It is quite enjoyable, but not fascinating for me.<br />I don't think it is so good as a fantasy novel.  It is not so imaginative, rather too realistic as a fantasy.  It doesn't describe an another world, but a mere variation of our real ordinary world.  It's rather a traditional school-life story.  However, I think that makes this novel readily acceptable to so many people, even to those who doesn't like fantasy novels very much.<br />The characters are rather two-dimensional.  Harry, Ron and Hermione are relatively well described, still I feel they are not flesh-and-blood people but chessmen of different roles.  And I don't like the description of the school houses rivalry; the house points are up and down like a computer game.  I might be fascinated, if this novel were more like a novel.	2001-12-01

For example, in &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, nobody dreams that languid Don Diego is Senor Zorro, while in these stories, the Army officers suspect Don Diego to be Zorro.  The stories mainly describe how the enemies try to trap Don Diego/Zorro and how Don Diego/Zorro brilliantly outwits them.

But I haven't been able to write a review for a long time.  Because I can't describe why this book is so fascinating without destroying the mystery.  This is a rather astonishing, extraordinary story, and I'd like you to read it without any preliminary knowledge if possible.<br />If you are not interested in horse-racing at all, don't worry.  I am not interested in horse-racing either, but I can enjoy Francis novels heartily.	2001-04-19

They are typical Saint stories; the Saint fights a life-and-death fight with a ferocious villain on one hand, and tweaks the nose of poor Inspector Teal on the other hand. The feud between the Saint and Teal reaches to the bitterest.  In later books such as &quot;The Saint and Mr. Teal&quot; or &quot;The Saint Intervenes&quot;, their relationship gets milder.<br />&quot;The Inland Revenue&quot; and &quot;The Melancholy Journey of Mr. Teal&quot; are not so good as I expected.  I know the Saint is never an infallible man, but he is too careless and makes too many mistakes in these stories. But &quot;The Million Pound Day&quot; is SUPERB!  I really LOVE it.  Very thrilling, fast-paced, action-packed and few dull parts.  One of the best Saint stories.  5 stars for this one.	2001-01-28

The Saint says &quot;The bloke who takes money off the bloke who takes money off the sucker is something even brighter.&quot;  Yes, he is a very bright guy, and that makes the stories smart and witty.  The Saint gives various medicine to various villains.  For example, he cons con men, blackmails a blackmailer, gives lessons to &quot;respectable&quot; men (such as a stock manipulator and an employer like a slave-driver) and helps Inspector Teal to solve murder cases.  I like &quot;The Prince of Cherkessia&quot; best; no dull parts and the most unexpected ending.	2000-12-29

The hero whale is Hralekana, son of Hruna (the hero of the first book).<br />I liked the first book, but I am disappointed in this second book.  The first seemed as though it had been written by a real whale.  But the second becomes an artificial propaganda of ecology and it is definite that it is written by a man pretending a whale. Hruna was an ordinary whale, but Hralekana is a supernatural symbol of ecology.  I feel sorry that this second book has ruined the charm of the first book.	2000-11-03

I really enjoyed adventure after adventure of young Simon Templar and his jolly friends. Anyway it is much better than its continuation. In &quot;Knight Templar&quot;, the enemy's plan was rather vague that made the whole story less thrilling.  But in &quot;The Last Hero&quot;, the subject is plain and simple; a fight for a devilish invention of a mad scientist. The story is much more thrilling and full of actions and wits. And the characters are much more vivid; Simon is so youthful and dynamic, his friends are so amiable, Marius is so ferocious and formidable, and Prince Rudolf's inhuman calmness heightened the tension of the climax.	2000-09-29

Because the enemy was so big, so strong and so merciless;  even the Saint was severely cornered several times.  But I was glad because  he still held his characteristics that made him so charming; impudence,  recklessness, sense of humor and sense of justice. I also enjoyed the story  very much; well-plotted, fast-paced and thrilling.  And the climax was so  dramatic!  It will be one of the best Saint novels.  Highly recommended.	2000-08-31

In  &quot;The Gold Standard&quot;, the Saint is involved in a murder at Paris  and goes back to England to be a headache for poor Inspector Teal.  The  second story is a continuation to the first story, but the third story has  little connection with the previous two stories and Mr. Teal doesn't appear  on the stage.<br />All the three stories are much better plotted than earlier  Saint novels (such as &quot;Knight Templar&quot; and &quot;Alias the  Saint&quot; I read before).  The stories are fast-paced and action-packed.  And the endings are sophisticated; the Saint gets rid of the evil illegally  as always, but he exhibits various solutions, not only simply kill the  evil.	2000-08-18

The former story is  enjoyable, but you will not see what the Saint is; you might misunderstand  him as a private detective or so.  The latter story is more  &quot;Saintly&quot;; the Saint smells out the evil and tries to get rid of  it - illegally. Both stories are enjoyable, but their plots are crude.  As  always in the Saint novels?	2000-07-27

However, guessing is one thing, proving it is another,especially when the one-track-minded authorities  (police and prosecution) firmly believe that they are absolutely right.   Mason uses a risky, but very splendid court tactics to prove the truth. It  is one of THE MOST SPLENDID tactics in all Mason stories.  Highly  recommended.	2000-07-13

I can point out a lot of defects of this novel; the style is old-fashioned and too figurative; the story is also old-fashioned; the plot is easy and crude. Nevertheless, I LIKE THIS NOVEL.   It has some inexplainable charm that fascinates me.  It may be partly  because of a charm of the hero, Simon Templar, alias the Saint.<br />I didn't  know this &quot;Knight Templar (alias The Avenging Saint)&quot; was a  continuation to &quot;The Last Hero&quot;.  I will read the previous story,  too.	2000-07-11

Multimillionaire Fremont Sabin was murdered and his pet parrot was squawking by him.  His son and his second wife begin disputing over the  inheritance.  That is an ordinary scene.  One thing that is not ordinary at  all; the parrot that was found nearby the body is NOT Sabin's parrot. Mason  soon locates the REAL Sabin's parrot...But a parrot can be a witness?   Well, it depends on how you interpret its talking. This story is the  shortest of all Mason mysteries and not so spectacular, but I like it very  much. The story is very well-plotted.  The mystery of the parrot(s) is  especially impressive.  The time element is also excellent.	2000-01-17

Events occured one after another from the beginning to the end and I never got bored.  Mrs. Breel, the shoplifting old lady, was the most peculiar of all  Mason's clients; her attitude was as cold as a cucumber but what she really  did were highly irrational.

But unfortunately,&quot;surprising&quot; doesn't always mean &quot;excellent&quot;.  Because in this novel, too much tricks are used to  lead this surprising ending.

His attitude is described metaphorically as &quot;skating on thin ice&quot;.  In this novel, Mason did not only skate  but made several somersaults on thin ice.  I just applauded that. But  Mason's spectacular stunt is not limited to this novel.  The distinctive  feature of this novel will be the importance of &quot;corpus delicti&quot;,  the proof that the victim is really dead and that the death is caused by  another people's criminal act.  If you want to know what I mean, just read  the book.	1999-08-26

This story was unusual as Perry Mason mysteries in several reasons; (1) Mason was assigned by the court as a defending lawyer for a penniless defendant, (2) the case was not a murder but a hold-up and (3) the trial  was on from the beginning of the story.  The situation went worse and worse  to the defendant, but Mason never gave up and at last succeeded in turning  the tables more dramatically than ever.  The story showed Mason's sincerity  as a lawyer; even if he couldn't earn no money, he did everything he could  for the defendant.  I wish I could retain Mason when I needed a criminal  lawyer.  And I liked the front cover; it was meaningful.	1999-02-28
