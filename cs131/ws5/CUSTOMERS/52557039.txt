US	52557039	RIX6OJ0EAVSVN	0446604844	473671370	Total Control	Books	2	5	7	N	N	No thumbs up	Not all that great. I enjoy this author but this book  had a too much going on and a lot of which was not going in the right direction.<br />For the most part the book was a great read. The character of  Sidney Archer and her story line were my real problem. This lady is smart enough  to know the FBI is following her, but doesn't assume they can tap her phone. She, in deductive reasoning,  concludes her husband has indeed sent her an email... How, Why? That was total bs. The character sees some  mail, magazines, delivered to the wrong place then she thinks the same, versus email. Interesting, She didn't check her own email that way.<br />The next problem was the gun fights. During gun fights you can't really stop and have a conversation. This happens toward the end of the book.   The two FBI agents and Sidney talk, not yell, over the gunfire. It had also been mentioned that all the lights had been shot out, and still, they saw each other. You had HRT members hit, hurt and not once did anyway yell, agent down.<br />Something like this happened prior in the book too. Sidney was fighting the unauthorized  visitor in her house and there was no light, yet, both could see how to fight the other person.  Doesn't add up.<br />That said, I would  give it two stars. These are major draw backs, but if you take out the Sidney Archer character, this all flies well.	2004-02-08

This is my first Prey novel and after I was done I wanted to give it a 50/50 reply, but on second thought I think it was a fascinating read. The author introduced several characters of dept with ease, kept a quick pace of  throughout the book  made a book that was very plausible. In many cases, write create situations to make parts of the story feasible, but this was not the case. Sudden Prey is  a chain of events that could happen any day to any of use.  Collateral damage is easily seen here.<br />The characters, nearly all, don't have tunnel vision throughout the plot as well. There are family challenges as well as cause and effect thoughts that make what the character says, all the more normal. <br /> I give it a 4 of 5.	2003-12-23

Well, three years later, I do. L.A. Dead.  It didn't float my boat, sorry. It didn't even make me want to read some of the authors other books. This  books seemed to cliché.<br />Maybe the author has something about CA that he wants to say or maybe this is just his style of writing, but the randomness of people jumping from bed to bed is just dumb. And everyone knows except the wife.  Just didn't seem to really grab me.<br />But let's go deeper. Stone, about to get married, just flies across the country to see his ex, who he supposedly had, on a prior event, retreated from.  Why? Other people wanted him to go but why? And Arrington had wanted him to come, but why? Nothing is really hinted or said.<br />He is a big shot lawyer, and yet he can go where he wants and not have to worry about seeing his clients. Granted, a lot can be done by phone, but a lot can't.<br />The actions of the main characters seem too easy. Stone is working from the desk of a dead guy on a movie lot. His wife sneaks on the lot and takes pictures of him. Well, she had not been to this lot before. How did she get into the lot and how did she know where the office was?<br />Why does Stone want to not be in the same house with his ex, yet does not protest when she breaks bail and flies across the country to see him. Oh,  there just happens to be a jet  waiting to take each back to the west coast.<br />Another thing I didn't seem to understand. The police and searching a house, and Stone gets there, doesn't ask for a warrant or anything. This book dispelled any and all belief this man can be a lawyer. Conflict of interest is no problem and he seems to only think of the law when is suits.<br />Dino, well that is a nice character.	2003-02-22

Void Moon is a book that will take you in many directions and each character, good guy or bad buy is someone that you will enjoy reading about.<br />Cassidy Black is the main focus, a woman with a past, on a job to make some quick money and has her own agenda.  Jack Karch, the bad guy, but the one you enjoy following.<br /><br />The characters are ones you can easily follow and you are given the opportunity to learn things as they learn. Reading this book is not escaping but rather a ride a long with a good guy/bad guy and a good girl/bad girl.  Toward the end of the book you learn a few things, but it is not as though you learn things that are mind boggling. You just have a better picture of the person.<br />I enjoyed Jack Karck. He as a bad guy, a ruthless one too, but his methods and patterns are ones you will enjoy.	2003-02-04

I found the book, easy to get in to and didn't have a hard time picking up on the characters at all. He also makes the pace a bit slower, just as a mature love would be and how older characters interact.<BR> <BR>He also, gives us two points of view in one chapter, one paragraph, something unique but can often confuse. I didn't enjoy the concept but he did it quite well. When  you are seeing and feeling what one character is feeling , you suddenly in the other characters head.<BR>My only other faults with the books were the sequence with Allie's fiancée. He seemed to just read minds for a moment or two there and just knew his lady was going cheating on him. This is a distraction. You think he will show up,  cause a scene, yet in the end, he is a tool, for her choice.<br />Reading the book, and really getting into the ending, one can't help but think about the terms To Death Do Us Part.	2002-12-29

The doctor who finds Bourne is shown as a drunk but seems quite intelligent when you pick up his comments to Bourne. It didn't add up. <br />I just didn't find the female character all that believable.  She seemed too easy to jump into a love story and deny all of her other existence.<br />Last, Carlos flew to the US the same time are Bourne did in the end. Why didn't anyone mention looking on the plane rosters that morning.<br />Carlos  who is said to be a well known face rushes past dozens of people, though one entry and no one says a word or looks at him<br />Gunfire in a house and no one calls the police.<br />Just plain weak.	2002-12-17

First, and I have read a few of the authors books, the manner in which she gives dialogue, such as He thinks and says is atrocious.The other book I read was Fortunes Rock, which, well I don't have anything nice to say so i will just keep my mouth shut. I have heard a lot of good about this author so I want to read her stuff. Yet, a lot is flat.  Just the way she has her characters interacting is enough to distract a read. Needs more doing, and not showing.<BR> But I managed to look past this. The book did keep me interested, as this woman's life seemed lost, suddenly, then stolen.  At any point she, Kathryn could have just snapped and we would not have thought anything of it. We may have hopped for it.<br />The interweaving of the past and present took a few chapters before I really began to see what it was worth. The author created chapters that were not flash backs, but a thought process. We see Kathryn  second guessing what she saw in her life. Did she see the signs her husband had a second life? Did she have clues? Did she have reasons to ever think about  it? These are all legitimate question that a person would not only think about but see in their head. The author was on the money with those. However, I think she may have gone one chapter too far, though. She reflects to the day her husband left and she say him hiding a shirt. That would have been the better point to end her reflecting. It brought the reader up to speed. The author, though, went back to  prior time once more time after bringing us up to seep. It can confuse the read on where and when the climax of the story is.<br />One last note. The stuff about the IRA was a stretch. She didn't make it work, with the exception of showing a dual life of her hubby.	2002-10-17

Not this time. 30 pages was all i could bare. The story has no voice. The prose is wretched. <br />The narrator used one voice to tell how everyone is thinking and feeling. And a 15 year old girl would have some flare, any flare to her  soul. The prose fits to the time, but, each character, told by the narrator with the same old  process makes them stale.  She tells the reader how a girl, 15 feels in reading a book that is very mature, but she admits the girl has a hard time reading. <br />Everything in the story is told, nothing is shown.  Just didn't make sense.  And it will never make sense. You can chop out every third word in this book too, and it might be a bit clearer.<br /> In the end, don't waste your time. Show, not tell, is skipped. You have stale characters, you have no flow and you have an author who refuses to let the readers just flow along with the book, to think with the pages. She would say something like. Olympia thinks to herself, that she, in her mind, should go downstairs. Olympia thinks, you don't need to herself written here.	2002-07-28

This book, I enjoyed as well, though, I don't feel I can give the book a 5 as I of do judge of the authors books. I have to give this book a 3, nearly a 4. Why? Well, and I think I could be wrong, but I felt the main character was able to befriend people way to easily. In fact, way too convenient. The girl helping him, the family helping him, and a person who works for the Foreign Office using phones that may or may not secure. <br />Okay, so this is my thought. People became this mans friend too easy. They trusted him. I thought this was off. I didn't think it was feasible. Though I must admit, he was in the a different county, where that may be more feasible. I live in the US and that just may not work. So I could be wrong. However, I also think about James Bond and in those flicks, he was able to get help of others. Things just happened for him.<br />My other point, when our main character spoke on the phone with his best friend who was living the double live. He just demanded to have a question answered. There was no rationale for it.<br />Other than that, I thought the book was good. In some ways it makes me think of Honor Among Thieves, though  that book was written many years latter.<br />Well, that is a enough, I don't want to bad mouth the guy. But I do think if you are like me, pretentious about things you will find a book has some big feasibility holes.<BR>	2002-04-20

First though. Romano was a great character. Funny  too.<br />Okay, here is my beef. It was not until very deep in the book that anyone actually wondered why a 10 year old kid was in an alley in the early AM hours.<br />Also  Claire is not at all a great therapist. Here she was, with Web under hipnosis and Romano walks in. She didn't stop the hypnosis, she didn't seem worried that the others persons words he spoke would  ruin Web's hypnosis, either.<br />Also, why and how would a psychologist person know about a wiring device, a bug. She glanced at it and just boom, new what is was. And of course, her office going blank while hit that web site. If it was just her office alone, that is shaddy. If it were  part of that floor, then  most of the devices in the closet would have been dark too. Very hard to detail.<br />Also, the whole dialogue part with Obannon and Strait, toward the end. Didn't seem to fit, more explanation than story.<br />Striat was the man who ran the major drug trade. Well, when we find this out in the book,  he was believed to be up in KY selling horses. His boss was asked to stay behind by the FBI., this trip. Well, Strait's boss was believed to always go on these trips, so how did straight sell his product on those times. It is just too easy that he sells it this time when the FBI asked his boss to say. And his boss had said he most of the trips. I think something should have been said about this man who planned so well and how he planed sales when his boss was around.<br />I think the novel is great, only that the last hundred pages seem rush and take the power out of the first part of the book.	2002-04-06

I read the book because anything I open I must finish however, this one really was a pin to complete. <br />I will admit, the author has a lot to say and a lot to tell you, but the way it was done. The prose, no timing, no clear thoughts and no coherence.  It was all too OVER THE TOP...<br />He will go on to tell you a back ground of a person and then throw in the present timeline. He use the word Negro and the Ni- - ger in the same paragraph with no though why a person would use both.<br />I do not think a lot of work was into detailing this book. There are so many characters and none are really describe, unless they are the unused Characters, such as Pig Lady.<br />Out of 170 pages, the last 50 or so had some sense in them.  Particularly,  the notion that Negro should not be around low class white. As though we must only be around the best whites to be seen well. Where as the low class white can hang around whoever they want and  not be seen ill.<br />The other notion is, all negros on the same page of though. People often say that we can't ever agree as a people. Well, 29 million people with one thought is not really easy.  So, let me use this point as for voting. We can't get ever negro to vote for the same man, but just to get every negro to vote would be great. And in this book, this is brought up in some light. People being of the communist  light, or in the rebellion stage. Well, you don't have to pick a party, but at least make sure you have the same cause. To this degree, the book had some thoughts	2002-03-04

He wasacting like a man with a mission and then a former fed. Also, the little insight on a criminal mind were nicely done. He(MC) didn't spend a lot of time on that either, just enough. <br />And last, i enjoyed how the character told you bits of insite on the FBI mind.

I did enjoy this book, very much so, however, I was bothered by a few things. Some of the segways from  the stream of stream of conscious seemed to   bit a bit disembodied.  You often wonder where is this going of where did that come from. In particular, some   references to the family being   from Louisiana. ( Not about being from the south and old school though)<br />The only other thing that bother me was the tendency to have many characters use the same verbiage. While this does represent the area, more than one character using the same term `in the cut' give the feeling of a list of stock characters words. Often characters from the same area may have the same vocabulary, but usage of he word is mixed as each person is making their respective mark.<br />Todd Waters	2001-12-25

She is in this house and never goes out for her own hygiene products. Get real.<br /> In another chapter. She is so worried about someone coming in the house and taking her keys. She is horrified. Wouldn't a mother be afraid of someone coming in the house and taking her children. At one point the phone rings and she is terrified that that someone will get her. What about the kids?<br />Later, when she thinks she is having contractions, she rushes out house to see the doctor. No mention of a babysitter.

I read it and had a hard time putting it down, though still felt a bit of a let down. <br />At points, the author makes a big deal to get one point across, then in the next chapter, they seem to not mention it  In one chapter, everyone is wondering where so-in-so is and in the last part of the chapter, we see this person. In the next chapter, he is not mentioned. So there is a build up and then........	2001-08-15

I have read many books by this author and  enjoyed all of them, especially, Pretend you don't see her. This one though, ....Oh well<br /> I feel the  Characters found results too easy and a line of though for the characters was not concise or even given. The main character, Elizabeth, tends to have many epiphanies. Too many.<br />And that annoying Alvirah is heard and not seen, not really her style.	2001-06-28

Though there were many characters, I didn't get lost. You'd have to expect that may characters in a book, as such.<br />I think the reader gives a, Unique, view of the eternal life in politics. And the world of the spin doctor is more understandable to everyone.  The reader can understand, better, many of the things seen in tv of the political nature, and understand why people volunteer to work as staffers, why some people have  a gift, why a person when choose to vote for can seem so powerful, yet relies on a team of people.  You can  really see a lot, within this book.	2001-06-16

US	52557039	R3UDMZTE95ZNDX	0671741195	68047735	The Cradle Will Fall	Books	2	5	10	N	N	Not her best	The Cradle Will Fall, by Mary Higgins Clark. I must tell you that I am disappointed by this book. The story, palpable at many edges and creative in the manner in which one character is painted in a bad light, but it fails to really leave you grinding your teeth for more. The Authors fashion is to set up intertwined chapters. Get you to a point where you are just about to guess what is  next and then you read what really is next, but across the town or from another pov. That failed in this book. You just assumed what would happen.   I dare not tell MHC how to write because I so enjoy her book, but a few parts were just too easy. So easy that the cliff-hanger feel died on me.  The young man, thief, who steals the doctors bag. Too convenient. Take out this character and his chapters. He ruined it.  Also, the bad, bad Doctor. If he is so cunning and cold, he would not have left the evidence in his trunk for so long.<br /> I think this story sacrificed some hard details and symbolism for a fast past edge. Not very fast but enough. <br />All in all, this an okay read, but not her best.	2001-05-11

I so enjoy this author but this book fell a bit short.<br />The Characters seem to be all over the place. And the underlying suspense seemed to fail with all the attention on the widow. I thought the subplots did not get pulled back to the main story.	2001-04-23

A pen pal of mine turned me on to Patrica Cornwell a few year back. She sent me her copy of All that remains. I enjoyed it some. Then later I read I Black Notice. I enjoyed that one too and found myself wanted to read more and more of the author. Why? So much had happened between those too books and I did enjoy the characters.   I didn't think I would get another book by this author until I read that The Last Precinct  starts right after Black Notice. I was interested in how the author would manage the after effect in a novel.  She did it Masterfully. Quite so. This is a very propelling book to read. With the right amount of symbolism we were able to see that the outside world cutting into the Dr's like just as how work might.<br />Uniquely, sub plots, as usually are ever present but not so much that it distract from the Doctors life.  We have scandal, lies and betrayal all together with a strong character with no way to turn.	2001-04-22

This `Work of Art' is, by all means, a medium to open doors in the minds of not only Blacks, young and old but anyone who is in a minority situation. The author tells one story, 4 times. How Whites affected his life as a  boy and now as a man and how he saw it, the interaction,  internal and from another point of view.  Though the book at times has rough tones, it is easy to take the examples given and use them in other situations. For example, the author tells of his weekend furlow from jails, coming home, hanging with some friends and the ambivalence about doing one thing or another that used to be done in his recent past.  This was much like a kid coming home from college for a weekend, after being away from his parents, changed in life a bit, comes home and see what he can and can't do. Take the cookie!<br /> In reading, the author opens the flood gates of knowledge we know, just have not fully processed. The result, we don't read the book , we just relate more and more from chapter to chapter. It made me want to Holler, for more to read this book. Open the mind. <br /> In closing, I would like to say that I enjoyed this book but I don't  feel it promotes or glories what he did. It only shows that he, as many do ,can get caught up in `a mess'. ...	2000-11-30

I'm not a fan of Baseball but I enjoyed the This Novel, The Motion Picture and a lot of what this book gave the reader. Granted, this book is not A  Baseball Clinic either. Chapel, the lead man, wakes up with a deck stacked against him and yet decides his own fate. That sounds clich, I'm sure, straight out of Star Trek even, but in this novel it rings true.  He may lose the game, already lost his girl, and his job may vanish, that's three strikes. So what do you do? You keep that chin up and you give life your best. Make yourself a big target and be defiant as you are Marked.  Chapel did it.  He pitched the game he could not top. Why would he? The feat was great, one to be admired. He left on his own terms, on top (was carried out too, by teammates)  and he understood what the women in his life said to him, what she wanted. He loved her. He needed to say it and needed her to hear it. Quite simply but hard to do.   The novel takes a man near icon status and his life, a kid at heart and reveals to us, the reader what makes people go. It can be Baseball, but it's love. Clich again, sorry.  The books says lot too on the game today, what people think of it and want.  Die  hard fans, and Die Hard players. Loyalty! Old School!.  I must add that I did not now enjoy the many ellipses. Too many! Scale of 1 through 5. `3'.	2000-10-13
