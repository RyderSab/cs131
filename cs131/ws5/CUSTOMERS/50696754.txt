Imagine yourself being 14.5 million dollars richer.<br />&quot;Ladies with Options&quot; is a humerous and well-written story of a group of 4 houswifes, 2 librarians, and one grad student turning $ into a fortune enough to rival Bill Gates' on the stock market. Told from the perspective of their lawyer, and daughter of one of the housewifes, the story is both unbelievable and funny. <br />What would you do if all of the sudden you had a couple extra million to spend at leisure? That's what the book's about, of course. The book is just so very fun to read, with a touch of romance and characters that seem real. The escapades of these ladies are hillarious. You'll be amazed at what a bunch of old ladies can do when they put their minds to it.<br />I recommend this book to everyone. It's positively delightful, and you won't regret reading it.	2001-03-04

But from Duffy's perspective, you see relationships in a whole new light. <br />Ben Duffy is adorable from the start, from the way he reacts to befuddling situations such as furniture shopping to the idea of holy matrimony. His character is funny and sweet and easy to relate to--even for women. Listening to him, beeing terrified of commitment makes sense!<br />Another postitive point about the book is that it gives women a chance to sit inside the head of an average male and find out what they think about us. Even though the book is written by a male, it's really a &quot;chick book,&quot; and it's quite good too.<br />The book gives a realistic sense of romance. Most contemporary romances would never have a stand-up-comedian with commitment problems as their hero, but contrary to the norm, it's almost a bit more romantic to have the Knight-in-Shining-Armor be cute and slightly confused.<br />I reccomend this book to all. It's well-written and romantic in a cute way, and a fun read that will make you smile.	2001-03-02

However, when a book becomes so unbelievable that it becomes bothersome, well, it's really not a good book. I have to say that the romance was well-written, but the plot was not. Technically, the plot isn't the most important part in a romance book, the romance takes precedence, but at least the author could attempt to make the said plot somewhat believable and orignal. <br />The plot goes as follows: Bookish scientist heroine wears ugly clothes and tries to blend in, because she despises society functions and prefers to study her medicines. (So far, so good. Typical, but not bad.) When her frilly sister can't go to her coming out ball because of a pimple, Heroine presents frilly sister with a jar of boot polish claiming it to be a cream to make zits go away, frilly sister thinks it actually works and of course introduces it to the ton, which makes her sister the cat's PJs because all the fine ladies would like some boot polish, too. <br />Enter tortured Hero, who must prove that the magic pimple-fixing cream is really false in order to win back his earldom. Heroine wears uglier clothes to make Hero go away. Hero wooes, romances, and smooches with Heroine until the inevitable conclusion of our story. <br />Personally, I think it's the silliest thing I've ever read. It's a nice romance, but why can't the author come up with something better than a pimple-fixing cream for a plot? Even the stereotypical hairbrained Ladies and Lords of Regency England aren't that stupid. And no girl without a title or fortune is going to be suddenly accepted into society because of a cream. It's a terrible plot device, and it really doesn't work. On top of that, the characters were a bit hollow and cliche and I found that I really couldn't sympathize with their plights. <br />I'm afraid that I don't agree with the rest of the people that found this book very enjoyable, and I wouldn't recommend it, espeically if you're bothered by plots like that.	2001-01-08

No, unfortunately Ms. Hamilton said she will not be writing a sequel, although she proposed one after writing &quot;Nightseer&quot; and it was refused. Now she says working on two series is enough for her. <br />Nightseer is a wonderfully fantastical book, her take on elves and the land of fantasy is similar to the ever-popular &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; but the plot is quite original and action-packed. Extremely. This book moves very quickly, and a good portion of it is filled up by action scene after action scene, sprinkled with bits of magic, sorcery, and demons. <br />Personally, I'm fond of the characters overall, although I wish there were fewer battles and more interaction between the characters. Lothar is my favorite guy... reminds me a bit of Frost from &quot;Kiss of Shadows,&quot; and there are other similarities as well. If you enjoyed that book, I think you'll find this one equally exciting, only more battle scenes.	2001-01-03

I am very much a fan of Arnette Lamb, but I was a bit dissapointed reading this. Alright, a lot dissapointed. Especially since the beginning is gorgeous, beautiful and romantically perfect with the promise of being a five-star book. <br />However, the plot wavered a bit, was strong in some places but weak in others. Suisan's determination and and goals morph dramatically, on top of the Big Misunderstanding, all caused by the evil Robert who's motives were completely unbelievable. There were a lot of things that I didn't believe. <br />I didn't believe the dialogue--it was flat, boring, unsensational, and scripted. I didn't believe anyone's motives, and the plot was pervasively &quot;blah&quot; in parts. That's not to say the book didn't have it's merits, however. The idea of Suisan masquerading as a maid was original and had incredible potential. But the characters were continually arguing and mistrusting, that I didn't really enjoy it. <br />Based on other reviews, I can see that it was rather well-liked, so whether or not I would reccomend this is based entirely on how nit-picky you get over plots and realness. :)	2000-11-30

She's a fantastic writer, and most of her books  are wonderfully funny and fun to read. &quot;Everything and the Moon&quot;  was an undeniably sweet book -- in the beginning. It's absolutely perfect,  with the love at the first sight and the romance and then... kapow, throw  in a completely misunderstood situation and the madly in love characters  suddenly become overly suspicious aliens.<br />When Robert realizes the  misunderstanding, that's when you get the non-alien Robert back. But  unfortunately, Victoria insists on being completely stubborn and clich&eacute; up  till the end of the book. It's a lovely story, but completely frustrating.  You want to knock some sense into these characters that've NO idea what  they're doing.<br />Beautifully written, though, and a very touching story.  You can't possibly not enjoy Ms. Quinn's books. I definitely suggest  reading this one.	2000-09-13

As an altogether book, absolutely superb. &quot;Hot Chocolate&quot; is an enchanting blend of humor and steamy scenes, each story featuring a cup of  delicious hot chocolate. I read this book particularly for Lori Foster, but  Suszanne Forster and Fayrene Preston also did an outstanding job.  <br />&quot;Not Abigail!&quot;, by Suzanne Forster, was packed with delicious  scenes. From the 'spiked' hot chocolate to the absent-minded but rather  gorgeous boss, this story was wonderfully charming. Plot: Abigial has been  pining for Max for years, but he's painfully oblivious. And when he  requests her help in finding a wife by Valentine's day, she takes desperate  measures. It's a rather cute plot, actually, I enjoyed it very much.<br />Lori  Foster's work, &quot;Tangled Sheets&quot; is my favorite. It goes from sexy  to erotic and the chemistry between Cole and 'Shelly' sizzles. Plot: Sophie  and Cole are in love with each other -- but neither of them knows it. So  Sophie creates a sexy alter ego / twin sister, Shelly, in the hopes of  seducing Cole. But it doesn't quite work that way. <br />The third story,  &quot;Buried in her Heart&quot; wasn't the best. In fact, I didn't really  like it at all. The characters were too clich√©, and the scenes were a bit  flat. The added cheesiness of the 'cute-little-animals' was a bit too much  for me. Plot: A lawyer, unsatisfied with her job, takes a break at a  bed-and-breakfast on the beach, where she meets Jack. But wait, Abby  secretly wants to be a cook, and how convenient that Jack is looking for  one. However will he convince her? <br />&quot;Ecstasy&quot; by Fayrene  Preston was sexy and adorable... but I'm still dying to know the secret  recipe for the 'orgasmic fudge.' Plot: Hayden wants to buy and market a  certain recipe from Brenna -- a certain kind of fudge that sends women into  throes of ecstasy. The problem is, she won't sell. Instead, Hayden  concentrates on what he wants more. Her. <br />I'd definitely recommendthis.  It's wonderful reading. And finding things by Lori Foster is very  difficult, but she's such a wonderful writer!	2000-09-03

For a book with a plot as dark and twisted as this one's, you couldn't possibly imagine there being an element of romance. But there is, and it  works.  And although I had a difficult time dealing with some of the more  harsher and nastier scenes, I was rather surprised to find that as a whole,  the book is very good. <br />Suzanne Forster must be a genius if she can weave  romance in with sadistic characters and chilling scenes, and actually  create a thrilling and suspenseful book. It works, though. <br />I'd recommend  this book, but not if you're squeamish or into happy, perky characters and  sunny plots. It's very angsty and depressing, but also erotic and  suspenseful. Ms. Forster is a very talented author.	2000-09-03
US	50696754	R63TGFUUCTJAX	1551665808	186019955	Once And For Always	Books	4	11	12	N	N	A good, deep read...	&quot;Once and For Always&quot; reminded me of Stella Cameron's other book, &quot;True Bliss.&quot; Although I never get tired of the plot  (childhood sweethearts meet up again years later and give it another try...  you can't go wrong...), I didn't really feel like I understood the  characters' actions. The hero was gorgeous, if a bit shy, but the heroine  seemed to be a bit mean towards him in terms of, &quot;We can't be together  until..ect. My problems come before you. Ect, ect.&quot; And yet in dealing  with her problems she seemed to be a bit weak-willed, letting her husband  push her around. <br />I did enjoy most of the book, though. It was a bit too  melodramatic for my tastes (I usually prefer a lighthearted one to an  angsty one.), but Stella Cameron is a wonderful writer, and she can't  really go wrong. She's a master at writing these types of plots. <br />I'd  recommend this book if you prefer those angsty romances with a happy  ending. It's a very sweet book, I thought it was very romantic.	2000-08-05

In &quot;Knight of  a Trillion Stars&quot; she creates characters and places that are vivid and  lovable. I've never seen another author that writes better futuristic  romance. <br />The heroine, Deana, finds a drop-dead gorgeous alien sitting on  her couch one afternoon, and he takes her back to his home planet to  complete his &quot;quest.&quot; (Note: All the guys on his planet are also  drop-dead gorgeous. Makes you want to visit there...*veg*) (Note: His  brother, Rejar, -- read &quot;Rejar&quot; afterwards -- is SUCH a delicious  kitty...) <br />This book sizzles with scalding little love scenes, and yet  the plot is still first-class exceptional. Some of the scenes (especially  with Rejar... oh, I just ADORE Rejar...) will have you choking back  laughter, and other ones will have you fanning yourself vigorously...  <br />I'd recommend this book if you're sane. If you don't read it, you'll  never know what you're missing. It's got ALL the elements of a good  Romance, not just one or two. A good plot, yummy characters, humor, the  works. And afterwards you'll have to read the sequel about Rejar (You'll  love him, honest, he's just so delectable... so cute... scratch him behind  his left ear...)	2000-08-04

In fact, I found I  was enjoying it some of the time. I thought the characters had a good deal  of potential, and with a bit of tweaking, the story could have been five  stars. <br />The problem I found, was that I was growing bored. I felt the  plot wasn't anything new, and the heroine didn't really strike me as  stubborn and fierce (though the hero seemed to think so), instead she  seemed a bit obnoxious, and I really couldn't see what was so wonderful  about her. Another thing I disliked was how they were supposed to be  looking for someone, but they spent the entire time on a farm &quot;mucking  out the stalls.&quot; So the plot slowed down there. <br />While this book  isn't the greatest thing I've ever read, but it was fairly enjoyable. I  would recommend not to buy it, but perhaps check it out at a library for a  quick, non-heavy read.	2000-08-04

The storyline is dark, with enough twists and turns to keep your eyes glued to the page. The first half of the book is excellent. I found Esther a very  headstrong and original character, and I think Tanith does a perfect job of  making her characters as different and strange as possible. Her writing  style is fantastic. <br />The second half of the book is a bit slower through  the turns, as it is the darker half of the book. While the ending was most  definetly shocking, I found it a bit of a dissapointment, because I felt  more should have happened... yet I would most definetly recommend this book  to any reader of Tanith Lee or other readers that prefer darker fantasies  or sci-fi.	2000-08-01

I found this book to be fairly enjoyable. &quot;Beyond Reach&quot; is a short story of a woman that wants to get away from her unemotinal family by signing on with the skipper of a yacht, a tall, blonde hunk. It wasn't bad,  and I found some of the secondary characters humerous, and the romance was  mostly well-told. The ending was a bit dull and predictable... but what can  you really expect?<br />I would recommend reading this as maybe a filler,  because it's such a quick, uncomplicated read, but probably don't go out  and buy it. It wasn't bad, honest. You'll probably find that you'll enjoy  it more than most short books, because the plot was a bit more original.	2000-07-25

I felt that all the characters reacted very believably, and  the historical details were accurate, and perfectly intertwined with the  romance. <br />I found I didn't really enjoy the romance part as much, which  was a bit less unbelievable and ah, spontaneous. And there certainly  weren't any sizzling love scenes to make up for it. It was a touching love  story, but not amazing. I would recommend this book to someone that  appreciates a good time travel, and doesn't mind a less-steamy romance. It  was such a good book, though.	2000-07-24

I fell in love with Sebastian after the first page, as well  as the author's straightforward writing style. There are so few  well-written modern romances, but I'd have to say that Stella Cameron does  them well. The only parts I disliked was the plot and secondary characters,  some of which I found were unnecessary and very contrived. The romance  part, on the other hand, was absoloutly stunning and flawless. With  exception of the plot (which another viewer has said as  &quot;disjointed,&quot; and I agree), it's a very worthwhile read. Some of  the scenes in there will have you fanning yourself for air, and I found  that skipping over the irrelevant parts don't really matter in the end  anway. <br />I'd definetly recommend this book to romance readers. Downside: A  bad plot. Upside: An outstanding romance. If you don't mind skipping parts,  I can promise you'll enjoy most of the book.	2000-07-15

I have not read any other books by this author, so I            can't compare, but as this books stands alone, I think it's perfect.<br />           The first-person dialogue is amazingly funny, and you  fall in love with the            secondary characters almost as much as you  do with Lucy. The wit and            humor were priceless, and so was the  ending (which would have been            disappointing if it were anything  else, since you spent the entire book            predicting it.). I'd  recommend this book to anyone that wants to read a            deliciously  funny romantic comedy.	2000-07-06

Well, m'dears, these shapeshifters aren't wolves this time, they're seals, and positively yummy. This book was rather interesting, in fact, for besides the original plot,  this is a contemporary romance that is written well. Kudos to Ms. Joy for  writing an excellent book. <br />I'd recommend this book if you're looking for  an original and well-written romance. Enjoy.	2000-07-01

The &quot;fairy tale&quot; element works well for Linda Jones, as not too many people have tried this in the romance genre. The book is not  vastly amazing or impressive, but it was a good read and not entirely  sappy. <br />I'd recommend this if you just want a good romance book to read  on a rainy day. It's not that bad.	2000-07-01

The Anita Blake series -- I cannot express enough how MUCH you need it read them if you haven't already. Let me tell you the reasons why.<br />One, the main character, Anita is tough and modern, and she could beat the socks  off of the biggest bodyguard out there at only 5'4 (with the help of some  uzis, sawed off shotguns, and her precious firestar.) <br />Two, the best  contemporary science-fiction/fantasy books you'll ever find. Guns,  vampires, werewolves, and necromancers are just a walk in the park.  <br />Three, (and I feel MOST important), might I mention that taking one look  at ANY of the male characters in this book is enough to make you stop,  drool, and forget your own name? How about that delectable French fanged  popsicle with the tight leather pants, Jean-Claude? (You can bite ME  anytime, JC!)<br />Ahem. In any case, I recommend these books to any sane  SF/Fantasy book lover out there, because I'm afraid dissapointment is not  an option. I am 99.9% sure you will fall in hopeless love with these books  after reading them, so get a head start, eh? <br />Guilty Pleasures is the  first book in (so far) a series of nine. Read away, m'friends...	2000-07-01

The way the author writes this book adds realism and  credibility. While most romance books prefer to not broach serious topics  like alchoholism (usually they get a bit dark and depressing), Ms. Putney  does an excellent job at entwining it with the romance. I liked this book  very much. <br />The heroine isn't bad, but the hero is delightfully complex,  and just this side of delectable. The whole book was utterly realistic  until the end, which I thought was a bit stretching reality, but that's  really the most I can find to complain about. This book was absoloutly  wonderful. <br />I'd recommend this to someone that wants a romance with  realistic characters and a good plot. This author's writing is very good.	2000-07-01

This book is another one of her winners. Both the hero and heroine are rich, likable characters, and I found the idea of  them being friends before lovers interesting. It worked very well, and  neither was the plot something we've all heard before. &quot;The  Pretenders&quot; was a refreshing read. I'd recommend this if you are a  reader that wants a good, non-angsty romance.	2000-06-28

I own them all, love them to death, and force them on all my poor friends. It's darker fantasy, but not morbid or bloody. You fall in love with the characters,  the world it's set in, the plotline -- in short, everything. <br />This first  book introduces Jaenelle, Daemon (I love this guy. Never met a tastier  &quot;dark and powerful&quot; character, yum yum.), Lucivar (Daemon's  half-brother. They're complete opposites, though he's fairly yummy too.),  and their father Saetan, Ruler of Hell (great guy.). Truly, you'll love  this book and all the others once you read it. I give this a ten out of ten  on any rating scale. And then I'd suggest buying it and it's sequels so you  can reccomend them to your friends and beg them to discuss it with you  (&quot;Well? What do you think? Hmmm? HMMMM?&quot;). <br />You really MUST  read this book if you like dark fantasy, because if you haven't read it you  really don't know what you're missing. What I like most about this book is  it's characters and compelling plot (&quot;Didn't you like the ending to  the third book? I LOVED it!&quot;). The part I liked least, of course, was  that it had to end at all...	2000-06-25

I can't really say what I liked most about it. What amazes me is how the author packed such a story into such a tiny book. Not that I'm complaining.  If you're in a mood for a good, short fantasy with some interesting twists,  this book and &quot;Nameless Magery&quot; would be what I'd reccomend. I  liked how this book picked up where the other one left off, but with a  different perspective. It's amazing how vastly different the tone of each  book is just by looking at the same storyline through a different  character's eyes. You'd have to read it to judge for yourself, but I think  these two books were perfect examples of Sci-Fi/Fantasy. They were very  good, honest.	2000-06-25
US	50696754	R2FY5OMQ90F33I	0451407806	36208249	Something Wicked	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Very Wicked indeed...	Wicked? Absoloutely. Ms. Beverly again presents us with another stunning masterpeice. The historical background is well-written, but more importantly, her characters are never dull. Neither are her story  plot-lines unoriginal. I found most of the book to be absoloutely  wonderful, (not to mention those &quot;wicked&quot; scenes that really do  live up to their namesake), but the ending was a bit boring, as if you  alreadly knew what was going to happen and spent the last fifty pages  waiting for it. But otherwise, truly an exceptional novel. A definite read  for Jo Beverly fans.	2000-06-25

Granted, there isn't alot of room for details in a short story book, so I don't grade it too harshly. The problem was that the  characters were your run-of-the mill hero and heroine, their reactions were  so very typical. The plot was dull and a bit cheesy, much like the  dialogue. It wasn't absoloutly terrible, it's just not really worth  reading. You're not really reading anything new, although the author did  effectively make Saskia come out annoying. Ah well, I've read better.	2000-06-25

Wonderful characters, great setting, outstanding plotlines... this entire series is really something you have to read. Even the way that the dialogue is written (which is  actually easy to get used to) adds flavor and definition to the book.  <br />&quot;The Cursed Towers&quot; does an effective job at picking up some  of the loose ends from &quot;The Pool of Two Moons&quot; and at the same  time starting some new sideplots. This book doesn't disappoint when  delivering this story. Should you read it? Absolutely. It's superb fantasy  writing at it's best.	2000-06-25

It took me over three months to get ahold of this book, but it was WELL worth the effort. The ending of &quot;Dark Dance&quot; dissapointed me, because I wished for more of the story. &quot;Personal Darkness&quot; picks  up right where it left off, which pleased me extremely much.<br />Let's just  say that I've never in my entire life read a better author than Tanith Lee.  Her writing is exemplary, managing to be dark without being melodramatic.  Her skill with words is unsurpassable -- she creates SUCH vivid images that  everything else looks dull in comparison. Her characters are rich and  exotic, the storylines of her books are beautifully dark.<br />Read &quot;Dark  Dance&quot; first, but then by all means, read &quot;Personal  Darkness.&quot; It's perfect for vampire lovers that can't seem to find a  good enough book. I'm half in-love with Malach (one of the characters that  premieres in Personal Darkness), and can't see why they'd categorize this  book as horror when you've got such a gorgeously yummy character like that.  My only advice is to set aside alot of your spare time for this book --  it's meant to be read in one sitting, or you'll go insane from the  suspense. And this is the kind of book that leaves you thinking for awhile  after reading it. You really just can't be disapointed after reading  anything by Tanith Lee. This is the kind of book that I can see satisfying  everyone. It's morbid enough for the horror readers, fantastic enough for  the fantasy readers, and erotic enough for the romance readers. As for  everyone else, well, you really can't hate this writing style, it's  magnificent. ;)	2000-06-25

I read the back cover, and the blub sounded interesting. I also read it because I love reading Science Fiction and Fantasy Romances. <br />I was a  bit dissapointed. The plot had an annoying tendency to be boringly slow  sometimes (for instance, the book is almost halfway through before the hero  and the heroine meet each other and have their first conversation), and  totally too fast at other times (example: They jump into bed with each  other, when they've only exchanged one or two meaningfull conversations.).  I felt like there wasn't enough interaction between the two characters to  warrant the kind of feelings they had for each other. The plot was  far-fetched, even for a Fantasy Romance, and I found the way the characters  reacted in certain situations hard to relate to. I felt that maybe the  author should have spent more time developing the romance, and narrowed  down the first hundered pages to about fifty. Another thing I disliked was  the way she wrote her sex scenes. I felt that the timing was completely  unrealistic, not to mention that the act itself wasn't anything special. In  all, I must say that I think the author can do better.	2000-06-06

As if the cover isn't enough to make you fall head over heels for the hero, Arnette Lamb manages a perfect sizzle and pop love story, with humor and sensuality written all over it. Duncan is hillarious, posing as a  foppish fool who is fond of peacocks in order to convince Miriam the  Diplomat that he's innocent. But at night he's the Border Lord, the  handsome and mysterious and most deliciously yummy &quot;ghost.&quot;  The  only tweak in this book is the ending, which is a bit dissapointing and a  little contrived. Still, the rest of the book is wonderful and makes up for  it in all other aspects. Read this book, of not all of Ms. Lamb's others,  because they're absoloutly priceless!	2000-02-27

I actually found that this book was better than the first one. The characters were all so very defined, that you sympathized with each one. The plot was intruiging, and the very end was so heart-wrenching, I found  myself crying for poor Isabeu! This is definetly a book to read.	1999-11-29
