Everyone was busy trying to either defend the IDS product space, reposition their products as IPS devices, or trying to dismiss the Gartner position. Many security engineers had to suddenly evaluate the IPS products on the market and make purchase and deployment decisions, as well. However, there's been a lack of understanding of this marketspace for some time. If you've been curious about this technology, you may want to look at Intrusion Prevention and Active Response: Deploying Network and Host IPS to help you understand these solutions.<br /><br />It would have been relatively easy to write a book that simply covered one facet of the IPS product space, such as network IPS systems. However, the authors have chosen to try and write a comprehensive overview of the tools currently available for both the network and the host, as well as ways in which they can be attacked and the scenarios they work in. While the book focuses on open source tools, including the Snort IPS extensions, the techniques apply to closed source, commercial tools as well.<br /><br />In general I found Intrusion Prevention to be a decent first book on the subject, although a bit unfocused in its delivery. At times it seems to try and bite off more than it can chew, or go off on a tangent for too long (such as the many pages of nmap options), but in general the book does a fair job of delivering its promise. Through it you'll get a good overview of many of the technologies present in the IPS marketspace and what they offer. If you're up to it, you'll even learn a few ways to test the tools and weed out the snake oil vendors.<br /><br />The book is heavy on actual system output and configuration examples. I like the explicit packet captures and snort rules, I think they go a long way towards illustrating the premise of an IPS system. As is somewhat common with Syngress press books, the formatting is a bit off at times (sometimes it's too wide or slips over the page boundary at the wrong time), but if you can work past that you're rewarded with a useful example.<br /><br />For host-based IPS solutions, the book covers a number of approaches that aren't always evident as IPS techniques. Various stack protection mechanisms, including LD_PRELOAD techniques like Libsafe, GCC modifications such as StackGuard, and kernel modifications like LIDS, PaX, RBAC and GrSecurity are all described.<br /><br />By now you can see that the book is pretty Linux and open source centric. This isn't too bad at all, since the basic functionality is present in most of the commercial tools, as well. These can include inline network data modification and reactions or application integrity checking tools. The open source versions, while they sometimes have fewer features, are excellent representatives of this technology.<br /><br />The book really comes together in chapter 8, 'Deploying Open Source IPS Solutions.' Several vulnerable systems are set up, deployed in a fictitious network, and protected through a variety of IPS solutions which work together to create a layered security model. If the network can detect the attack, it's dropped or modified to remove the offending bits. If the malicious data gets through to the host, the host-level IPS tools remediate the problem. All in all a nice example chapter.<br /><br />The discussion on how to evade IPS devices was a bit lacking, unfortunately. It seems squeezed in, and doesn't have the same level of detail as other chapters on similar topics. Detailed descriptions of the layer 3, 4 and application layer obfuscation techniques would have been useful to help explain this complex topic.<br /><br />Before you begin thinking that the authors are entirely gung-ho on IPS technologies, they spend a long time discussing how they can be fooled and how they are fundamentally prone to false positives. This tempered stance is valuable, and they recommend that you take a limited set of functionality from your IDS system and make it reactive in your IPS.<br /><br />There are only a couple of books that cover IPS technologies to any significant degree, and this appears to be the only one solely devoted to discussing IPS approaches for both the host and network. To that end, the authors have done a pretty good job of introducing the reader to what an IPS can give them, how to evaluate it, and what to expect in the real world. While the book itself has some production and layout problems, the material is worthwhile and will give the reader much-needed advice.le, and they recommend that you take a limited set of functionality from your IDS system and make it reactive in your IPS. <br /> <br />There are only a couple of books that cover IPS technologies to any significant degree, and this appears to be the only one solely devoted to discussing IPS approaches for both the host and network.

Host integrity monitoring is the process by which system and network administrators validate and enforce the security of their systems. This can be a complex suite of approaches, tools, and methodologies, and it can be as simple as looking at loggin output. In the past, tools like Tripwire were used to check the configurations on hosts. The freeware version of this tool was limited in its manageability, which was available mainly in the commercial version.<br /><br />Tools like Osiris and Samhain came along to fill the gap and have since evolved into mature projects themselves. Like any existing software tool out there, any new book should be evaluated not only on its own but also in he context of the existing documentation. Both Osiris and Samhain have decent amounts of documentation available already (Samhain seems to have a larger user documentation repository online than the Osiris tool does), and the book contributes to these docs quite well.<br /><br />Host Integrity Monitoring shows you how to set up these tools and put them into production on Windows, UNIX, and OS X. Wotring's writing is fairly good, and his examples are usually pretty clear. The pace of the material is good, and there's not a whole lot of domain-specific expertise beyond system administration skills required to make use of the book. At times some of the formatting of the text gets in the way, but that's trivial compared to the quality of writing (which is pretty good).<br /><br />Overall the material in the book is decent. The book opens with an overview of what host integrity monitoring is, why you should use it, and some of the basic premises. Then it goes on to discuss Samhain and Osiris, starting with their basic installation and then on to their advanced usage. They differ enough that each project merits its own pieces of documentation, even though they're similar in spirit. You'll learn how to schedule scans, integrate with other tools like Swatch, and in general administer a site installation.<br /><br />The author of the book, Brian Wotring, is also the author of Osiris and is clearly more familiar with Osiris than he is with Samhain. More material (100 pages) is devoted to using Osiris than is given to Samhain (60 pages), which is to be expected. The coverage of both is sufficient, though, and fills the major parts of the book.<br /><br />There are three major strengths to this book over the existing docs. The first is seeing not just the tools themselves covered but also the threats they cover in place. The second is having the two tools covered side by side, allowing you to see how to accomplish the same task with each. And thirdly, there are two appendices that are true gems of this book. The first covers how to get your Linksys Linux based AP device monitored using the Osiris tool, which isn't a small feat. The second is how to write your own modules for Osiris and Samhain, for which this appears to be the only documentation for Osiris (Samhain's website has a How To on writing modules). Again, these add value to the book over the freely available documentation.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen the chapters devoted specifically to Osiris and Samhain, chapters 6 (Osiris) and 7 (Samhain) broken up into two or three chapters covering their installation and use. The length of these chapters can make finding some material difficult at times. I would have also have liked to see the use of the \\"bold is input, normal text is output\\" technical book convention. In many examples finding the user input text can be challenging.<br /><br />Host Integrity Monitoring Using Osiris and Samhain is not only about these tools but about how to accomplish host integrity monitoring on the cheap (since the code is freely available). While you can find docs on each project, this book complements those docs nicely and provides a nicely wrapped package about how to get the most out of each tool. If you've been thinking about how to ensure that no one is tampering with your system, these tools, and this book, should definitely make your solutions list.t no one is tampering with your system, these tools, and this book, should definitely make your solutions list.	2005-09-06
US	46121444	RD4CV07OS2OYI	0596004036	993860716	Kerberos: The Definitive Guide	Books	4	37	38	N	N	Kerberos intimidates a lot of people, don't be one of them	I got started using Kerberos many moons ago, at my university. This is probably how many people got to know about it. While I didn't use it very much, it's there that I learned the basics and experimented a bit with Kerberos. Interest in it took off after Microsoft incorporated Kerberos authentication mechanisms into Windows 2000. Suddenly it wasn't such arcane knowledge.<br /><br />Two open source Kerberos implementations exist, the MIT reference implementation, and the Heimdal Kerberos implementation. Even then, there are two main versions which you can find, Kerberos IV and Kerberos V. Kerberos IV went away for most environments with the passing of the Y2K mark, but some legacy apps need support. So, you still have to deal with it on occasion.<br /><br />In writing Secure Architectures with OpenBSD, I got a lot more intimate with Kerberos, and even set up a decently sized realm in my house. Hence, I got to experience the turmoil of setup and debugging. A book like Kerberos: The Definitive Guide (K:TDG) would have been very welcome. Instead, I slogged my way through it, and got it to work for the most part.<br /><br />K:TDG will help you set up your Kerberos world by introducing you to the complex subject, terminology, and the pieces. Once you learn the basics, you recognize that a simple realm is actually somewhat easy to set up. The author, Jason Garman, uses a mixed Mac OS X, UNIX, and Windows environment, focusing on UNIX most of the time. The bulk of the examples deal with MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.3 (krb5-1.3) but should work for most versions. Some attention is given to the Heimdal implementation (which is integrated with BSD, for example), and for the most part you'll be OK. Windows examples are also pretty copious but always come second. If you're comfortable with UNIX, you'll easily be able to translate these into Windows examples to help bridge the Windows gaps.<br /><br />Chapter 1 is an obligatory Introduction, a short chapter that introduces the key concepts of Kerberos and what the book will cover. A very quick comparison of Kerberos to DCE, SESAME, and earlier versions of Kerberos is given. This chapter serves as a nice selling point for the book, it's the type of thing you'd flip through in the book store to decide if you should buy the book or not.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is a decent overview for the new user of Kerberos to the system and how it works. Kerberos is placed into its role in a AAA infrastructure - authentication, authorization, and accounting - as well as some caveats that are commonly made. You'll learn about core Kerberos features like tickets, realms, principles, instances, ticket granting tickets, and the ticket cache. A decent overview for practical purposes is given, but you will definitely want another resource if you're interested in diving headlong into Kerberos.<br /><br />These pieces come together in Chapter 3, where the actual protocols are described. They're laid out for a non-cryptographer, so go elsewhere if you want to learn the real formal material behind the system. Understanding the protocols is important to understanding the service as a whole. For someone new to Kerberos, you'll probably want to spend a little more time reading this to get oriented in the Kerberos world. The chapter doesn't mess around too much and delivers a fair treatment of the material.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is the meat of the book's material, setting up your implementation. It all starts with the KDC (key distribution center) and realm initialization. Again, the bulk of the treatment is on the MIT implementation on UNIX, with the Heimdal and then Windows sections following next. Slave KDCs are also introduced, which is useful for large environments. An OS X server is missing, but Kerberos clients for all three (UNIX, Windows and OS X) is given. The role of DNS is also explained well, a useful touch that's missing in some Kerberos documents I've used in the past. This chapter will get you started, and withsome of the supplied documentation you should be up and running in no time.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is devoted to troubleshooting, an all too familiar task for a new Kerberos administrator. Common problems, their diagnosis, and resolution are discussed. I like the presentation of this chapter and think it will be useful for most real-world situations you'll encounter.<br /><br />Security concerns with Kerberos are covered in Chapter 6, which discusses concrete and abstract attacks on the Kerberos scheme. Since all of the security in Kerberos resides in your KDC hosts, obviously this covers some of the material. However, the clients can exposes your Kerberos realm to attacks, as well, and how to circumvent these problems is covered. A decent and practical chapter, and covered on both UNIX and Windows.<br /><br />In Chapter 7 a number of Kerberos enabled applications are discussed. After all, you can do more than just log on locally with Kerberos, you can use remote login programs like SSH, remote access scenarios like printing, and even control X via Kerberos. While not every application that I would have liked was covered, the treatment was fair and should get you started with a number of Kerberos enabled tools in your new realm.<br /><br />A strong selling point of the book is given in Chapter 8, titled Advanced Topics. Three main topics are discussed. The first is cross-realm authentication, where you have more than one separate Kerberos realm on your network but you want to have users switch between the two without creating accounts in the other. This can get tricky, and the book does a decent job of introducing it, but it's not as complete as it could be. The second main topic in this chapter is Kerberos 4 and 5 interoperability, which is relatively straightforward. Most Kerberos 5 implementations come with tools to process Kerberos 4 ticket scenarios to handle legacy applications. And finally, a really valuable section covers UNIX and Windows Kerberos interoperability, a hairy issue. Again, incomplete but strong enough that you should be able to get it working with some elbow grease. This is probably the most valuable chapter of the book, which does a decent job at the introductory level, but you'll be left to tie up a few loose ends on your own.<br /><br />An obligatory case study is given in Chapter 9, where you can see a number of configuration samples and even a mixed Windows-UNIX environment. Not terribly useful when compared to chapters 4 and 8, but overall worthwhile. It may answer some of your questions, even. Chapter 10 wraps up the book with looking at Kerberos futures, which isn't all that useful, honestly. What gets more useful is the appendix, which gives an administration reference. Lots of commands are given for MIT, Heimdal and even for Windows, so you can quickly jump there to refresh your memory on a topic.<br /><br />Overall this book is recommended if you need a place to start working on Kerberos, especially in a mixed environment. The MIT and Heimdal documents are a fair place to start for a UNIX only Kerberos realm, but if you find they aren't enough, this is probably the right book for you. The book's main strength is that it covers Kerberos on the three main platforms in use (Windows, OS X, and UNIX), although it could provide a deeper treatment to the mixed environment than it gives.

US	46121444	R1ENVV141OZVPS	0321268172	121033767	File System Forensic Analysis	Books	5	42	45	N	N	excellent coverage of the area, high quality writing	It's easy to think that computer filesystems are relatively simple things. After all, if 'dir' or 'ls' don't show what you're looking for, maybe an undelete program will work. Or will it? To be a decent, trustworthy expert in forensics (a requirement if you plan to participate in any criminal investigations), you'll have to learn how filesystems really operate, how tools like undelete and lazarus work, and how they can be defeated.<br /><br />Carrier's book isn't a legal book at all, and it doesn't pretend to offer much insight into the law surrounding forensics. Instead it focuses on technical matters, and is sure to be the gold standard in its field. This is important, because it comes at you expecting you to have some knowledge, even if only informal, of what a filesystem contains. With a basic understanding of data structures, you'll get a wealth of information out of this book, and it will be a good reference long after you've first studied it.<br /><br />File System Forensic Analysis is divided into three sections. These are arranged in the order that you'll want to study them to maximize the benefit you can hope to achieve, namely an understanding of how to examine filesystems for hidden or previously stored data. The first three chapters cover a fundamental series of topics: Digital Investigation Foundations, Computer Foundations, and an introduction to Hard Disk Data Acquisition. While they start at a basic level (e.g. what hexadecimal is), they quickly progress to more developed topics, such as the types of interfaces (SATA, SCSI, IDE), the relationship of the disk to the computer system as a whole, and how data is stored in a file and filesystem at a basic level. A lot of examples given use Linux, due to the raw, accessible nature of UNIX and UNIX-like systems, and the availability of tools like 'dd' to gather data.<br /><br />Part 2 covers \\"Volume Analysis,\\" or the organization of files into a storage system. This introduces the basics of things like partition tables (including how to read one). The next few chapters cover PC-based partitions (DOS and Apple), server-based partitions (BSD, Solaris and GPT partitions), and then multiple disk volumes like RAID and logical volumes. With this introduction, the final chapter of the section covers how to use these filesystem descriptions in practice to look for data during analysis. Filesystem layouts, organization, and things like journals and consistency checks are covered with a clarity and exactness that's refreshing for such a detailed topic.<br /><br />Having covered the basics of filesystems, Part 3 covers the bulk of the book and material. Several chapters follow that specifically show you how to analyze particular filesystems by using their data structures to direct your reads. A range of filesystems are covered, including FAT, NTFS, EXT2 and EXT3, and the BSD types UFS1 and UFS2. Each filesystem has two chapters, one devoted to concepts and analysis, another entirely about data structures. Dividing each filesystem type like this lets Carrier focus first on the theory of each filesystem and its design, and then the practical use of its design to actually understand how to pull data off of it.<br /><br />The real strength of File System Forensic Analysis lies in Carrier's direct and clear descriptions of the concepts, the completeness of his coverage, and the detail he provides. For example, a number of clear, well-ordered and simple diagrams are peppered throughout the book, explaining everything from allocation algorithms to NTFS alternative data streams. This use of simple diagrams makes the topics more easily understood, so the book's full value can be appreciated. This is the kind of thing that sets a book apart from its peers and makes it a valuable resource for a long time.<br /><br />Finally, Carrier brings it all together and shows us how many aspects of filesystems can be examined using his \\"sleuth kit\\" tools, freely available and easy to use. Without appearing to hawk this tool at the expense of other valuable resources, you get to see how simple and direct filesystem manipulations can be done using a direct approach. This kind of presentation is what makes File System Forensic Analysis a great foundation.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with File System Forensic Analysis, I think that Carrier has achieved what few technical authors do, namely a clear explanation of highly technical topics which retains a level of detail that makes it valuable for the long term. For anyone looking seriously at electronic forensics, this is a must have. I suspect people who are working on filesystem implementations will also want to study it for its practical information about NTFS. Overall, a great technical resource..

Some may wonder if Hoglund and Butler are being irresponsible by writing a book that shows you how to bypass detection. If you look closely, however, you'll see that all of the methods they outline are detectable by current rootkit revealing mechanisms. And they also show you how to detect many new rootkits in the process. I consider this book to be a responsible contribution to the community, professionals and amateurs alike, in the finest tradition full disclosure.<br /><br />The book is organized into three major sections, even if it's not explicitly marked as such. The first section serves as an introduction to the topic and some of the high level concepts you'll need to know about Windows, control mechanisms, and where you can introduce your code. The second part is a highly technical tour of the techniques used to hook your rootkit in and hide it, And the third section is really one chapter covering detection of rootkits.<br /><br />The first few chapters, which serve to introduce the topic, get technical right away. Chapter 2, for example, shows you some basic mechanisms for hooking in your rootkit. If you're getting lost at this point, you'll want to probably augment your reading with a Win32 internals book. The resources listed by the authors, though, are great. By this point you can also see that the writing is clear and the examples contribute perfectly to the topic. Hardware hooking basics are covered in chapter 3, which should give you some indication of the book's pace (quick!).<br /><br />By the time you get to chapter 4 and discussing how to hook into both userland and the kernel, you're getting at some very valuable material. Although the book focuses on kernel hooking, a brief description of userland hooking is provided. Chapter 5 covers runtime patching, a black art that's not well known. This is almost worth the full price of admission, but the material gets even better.<br /><br />In chapters 6-9 you get into some serious deep voodoo and dark arts. In these chapters you'll learn the basics of direct kernel object manipulation, layered device drivers (which can save you a lot of work), hardware manipulation, and network handling. All of these are techniques used by rootkit authors to varying degrees and effect, so you should become familiar with them. The code examples are clear and functional, and you'll learn enough to write a basic rootkit in only about 150 pages. Simple keyboard sniffers and covert channels are described in the code examples. Useful stuff.<br /><br />I can't say I found many errors or nits in the book. There's some problems at times getting the code formatting just right, and what appear to be a few stray characters here and there, but nothing too obvious to me. Then again, I'm not a Windows kernel programmer, so I don't feel qualified to comment on the correctness of the code.<br /><br />In the finest tradition of using a blog and dynamic website to assist your readers, the authors have set up rootkit.com, which nicely supplements their book. Most of the resources they mention in the book are available here, as well as a great array of contributors and evolving techniques. Without the book the site is still useful, but together they're a great combination. Too many books lose their value once you read them, and some books stay with you because you're having difficulty understanding the authors. Rootkits will stay near you while you develop your skills because it's a lot of material in a small space, and although it's very clearly written, there is a deep amount of material to digest. You'll be working with this one for a while.<br /><br />My only major wish for this book is for it to have covered detection more significantly. One chapter covers how to detect rootkits, and although you may be able to look for some specific telltale signs of rootkits depending on how they were introduced, a more complete coverage of this approach would have made the book even more worthwhile.<br /><br />Rootkits is an invaluable contribution in the wider understanding of advanced attack and hacker techniques. Previously, much of this material was known to only a handful of people, and assembling your own knowledge base was difficult. Hoglund and Butler write clearly, use great code examples, and deliver an excellent book on a high technical and specialized topic. If you're interested in learning how to write your own rootkit or detect someone else's rootkit on your system, you should definitely start with this book.e. <br /> <br />Rootkits is an invaluable contribution in the wider understanding of advanced attack and hacker techniques.

It's a profession that has a bit of an establishment atmosphere to it where entry to various levels is granted in secret. And it's often hard to understand where to start. Infosec Career Hacking attempts to demystify this process and show you not only generic strategies for employment, but ones specific to the information security field.<br /><br />The book focuses on career development, not on how to be a hacker or a professional hacker. It's full of some useful information about building a successful career, much of which applies to any technical field. It also focuses mostly on being in the infosec service business, not in product development or, to a large degree, operations. Keep that in mind when you think about buying it. While most of what you'll learn is generic technical career advice, some of it is focused.<br /><br />The first part of the book is especially useful, and I think provides most of the value that's not available elsewhere. Things that are covered may seem like basics that people should have just picked up, but it's hard to know what you're supposed to know when you change environments, let alone see it all together in one place. I find this section to be especially useful and reasonably well written.<br /><br />Chapter 1 opens up with a basic orientation of the infosec landscape, including the types of companies and organizations you may want to look at working with, the types of work and positions you see typically, and what kinds of skills you'll need to consider get the interview, let alone the job. Chapter 2 is much like a hacking book in that you're encouraged to perform some scout work on your potential places of employment. Good advice, and it's nice to see it demonstrated. Chapter 3 talks about getting experience and getting your feet wet in the infosec world. Things like conferences, local groups and meetings, and even security clearances are covered. A nice overview, but a it shallow in places, too. Chapter 4 focuses on the resume and the interview, the kinds of things that normally jump to mind when you think about career hacking. A decent overview, and good things to learn.<br /><br />Part 2 focuses on technical parts. These chapters, I felt, were a bit thin on value and attempted to provide too much coverage but without the depth. What I felt this part of the book was trying to do was to be a quick overview of what you should know if you want a career in information security without any of the work it takes. Because this is such a broad amount of material, and the book only spends about 180 pages on it, the coverage isn't deep. Instead, the cursory coverage is a detriment to the book's value.<br /><br />Chapter 5 is where I found the most material to complain about. This chapter is titled, 'The Laws of Security', and can be used for your benefit or your downfall. In the right hands, where the nuances that come from actually encountering these challenges in the wild and discovering the reasoning behind them, you can display wisdom. In the wrong hands, where you can't successfully defend a challenge to these axioms, at best you'll appear to be someone who parrots security luminaries, and at worst you'll look like an uninformed buffoon. If you decide to accept conclusions without understanding the reasoning behind them, you're asking for it.<br /><br />Chapter 6 talks about building a home lab of machines for attack. I felt this chapter devoted too much time to drooling over gear and not enough time discussing more equipment and more valuable gear. Large classes of lab resources, including enterprise applications, networking gear, and even commercial security software was left out. The disclosure debate was reasonably well handled in chapter 7, discussing the various ways that people have established this process. What's missing here is how to actually find where to send the report to and how to ensure it'sbeen acted upon.

US	46121444	RCW9ZIC59TI3B	0321304543	243113582	The Art of  Computer Virus Research and Defense	Books	5	11	14	N	N	Learn the basics of malware analysis	I think by now we're all familiar with viruses and worms. It may have been a term paper diskette chewed up by a virus back in college, a family member's computer infected with the latest worm, or your email inbox clogged with a mass mailer of the week. But how do AV researchers dissect such malware, especially when virus writers have devoted so much time to avoiding detection and perfecting their craft with self-decrypting viruses, polymorphic shellcode, and obfuscated loops. Haven't you wanted a peek into how that's done, and how you would analyze such a monster that landed in your computer? Well, Peter Szor's book The Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense (TAOCVRD) has been gaining lots of critical acclaim lately for filling that gap, and rightfully so. (Before we begin, however, I should make one thing perfectly clear: I was a technical reviewer of this book. I enjoyed it when I read it originally, and I'm even more pleased with the final result. And now on to your regularly scheduled review.)<br /><br />TAOCVRD opens with Part 1: Strategies of the attacker. Here we get to start to think about malicious code from the original ideas and viewpoints of its makers. Chapter 1 opens up with various games of the classic computer science world, including Conway's Game of Life and Core Wars, which is still fun after all of these years. From this we can start to think about computer viruses as a natural extension of other self-replicating computer structures. What's great about this chapter is that you can actually understand, and share in, the fascination of replicating code. It's as if you can understand the pure world that some virus writers live in.<br /><br />Chapter 2 starts off the virus-analysis section, including some of the basics (like the types of malicious programs and their key features), as well as the naming scheme. Chapter 3, \\"Malicious Code Environments,\\" serves as a lengthy and complete description of how various viruses work. The dependencies that you would expect to see, including OS, CPU, file formats, and filesystems, are all described. Then Szor goes on to describe how viruses work with various languages, from REXX and DCL to Python and even Office macros. Not all of the descriptions are lengthy, but you get to see how flexible the world of writing a virus can be. What I most enjoyed about the book overall is represented in this chapter, namely Szor's command of the history of the virus as well as his technical prowess, which he drops in as appropriate.<br /><br />Chapter 4 gets a bit more technical and now focuses on infection strategies. Again, Szor isn't afraid to delve into history or technical meat, including a lengthy and valuable section \\"An In-Depth Look at Win32 Viruses.\\" If you don't feel armed to start dissecting viruses by this point, you're in luck: there's so much more to read. Chapter 5 covers in-memory strategies used by viruses to locate files, processes, and sometimes evade detection. Szor has a list of interrupts and their utility to the virus writer, providing a comprehensive resource to the virus analyst.<br /><br />Chapters 6 and 7 cover basic and advanced self protection schemes, respectively, used by viruses. TAOCVRD's completeness of information in a usable space, together with very functional examples and descriptions, is again evident. Szor walks you through a basic decryptor routine, for example, showing you how a self-contained virus can be both evasive and functional at the same time. Sadly little attention is given to various virus construction kits at the end of chapter 7, though.<br /><br />Chapters 8 and 9 get a little less technical and somewhat more historical. These chapters cover virus payloads and their classification (ie benevolent viruses, destructive viruses, etc) and computer worms, respectively. The overview of payloads is almost entirely historical, giving a great overview of how virus writers have used their techniques to cause havoc or just have \\"fun\\" from time to time. Chapter 9 gives a concise and valuable overview of computer worms, almost boiling about half of my worms book down into just one chapter in a clear and easy to use fashion.<br /><br />Part 1 concludes with chapter 10, which covers exploits and attack techniques used by worms and viruses. Again, Szor's clarity of explanation shines as he artfully gives a concise overview of how a buffer overflow attack works (including stack layout and address manipulation), heap-based attacks, format string attacks, and related methods. He then discusses these techniques in light of various historical examples, clearly explaining how they operated and were successful. If you've been yearning for a short overview of attack techniques and how malware has used them, this chapter is for you.<br /><br />Part 2 covers the defender's strategies. Chapter 11 serves as a nice introduction to this section by describing many of the current and advanced defense techniques such as some of the first and second generation scanners, code and system emulation, and metamorphic virus detection. This is all covered in nice technical detail, always at a reasonable level to not leave everyone in the dust. Through it all small examples are constantly given, which reinforce the text nicely. Chapter 12 is very similar, this time focusing on in-memory scanning and analysis techniques.<br /><br />Chapter 13 covers worm blocking techniques, focusing on host-based methods which can prevent the buffer overflow from being successful or the code from arbitrarily gaining network access again. Chapter 14 complements this with network specific defenses, including ACLs and firewalls, IDS systems, honeypots, and even counterattacks. These two chapters are a lot less technical than the previous two, but still quite valuable.<br /><br />By this point I'm sure you're ready to try your hand at virus analysis, and Szor is eager to help you out. In chapter 15 he gives you a great setup for virus analysis, including various tools and examples of how they work and what kind of information they give you. Finally, in chapter 16 you have the obligatory (and valuable) resource roundup which complements the references given in every chapter, as well.<br /><br />Overall I find Szor's book to be amazing, both in terms of its technical prowess over so many specifics in the field but also for its presentation. Without dumbing it down, Szor's able to communicate to most readers with clarity in a manner they'll understand, learn from, and be able to use. I think that many of us, especially those of us who get plundered in our email inboxes with malware, are curious to spend some time dissecting these beasts using techniques AV professionals use, and Szor's book does an exemplary job of introducing that world to us all. I consider this to be one of the most important computer security books I own due to it's clarity and completeness of coverage.n\\" from time to time.

Continuing in the new theme of fiction and technical how-to, Aggressive Network Self-Defense brings together several authors to provide a wide range of material. Syngress' niche in this space seems to be breaking new ground -- and for the most part, it works. While you don't get as in-depth a treatment as a typical technical book gives you, there is an added dimension: namely, a more realistic scenario of how these tools fit together in a real, live series of actions.<br /><br />Not being a big fan of most fiction (I tend to prefer history), it's hard to say definitively good or bad things about the quality of the writing. What I can say is that it's infinitely less irritating, and far more realistic, than Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon or Gibson's Neuromancer. No over-the-top smearing of adjectives to describe the mundane, and no unrealistic sequences of events. Then again, there's no character development and no real story progression, so it's not great fiction.<br /><br />As a series of hacker vignettes, the book works just fine, and very well for the purposes at hand. Basically, what the authors want you to get from the book is two-fold: First, they want you to debate the issues around \\"strike back\\" attack methodologies. Several of the authors are open advocates of what are legal grey areas and open moral questions in the field of network security. Secondly, they want you to see how it's done, what you do when you actually use a tool to achieve a goal. Most books that do this, like Hacking Exposed, cover far more tools, but they usually do so without showing you each tool's use in a real-world scenario.<br /><br />I won't bore you with a lengthy, detailed overview of the first part of the book. Like I said, it's a series of part fiction, part tutorial series of short stories. In them, you'll see tools like Metasploit, virus creation, some nmap, sniffers, and keystroke loggers, all in action, being used as an operator would use them, and achieving real goals. This is more valuable than a basic manual, and the stories themselves act as a nice setting. While not great fiction writers, the authors are decent enough at the job, and they write the technical material clearly.<br /><br />The second part of the book is interesting. It makes up about a fifth of the book in volume, but a lot more in technical weight. The book bills this section as \\"The technologies and concepts behind network strike-back,\\" and that's an accurate summary. It's a series of four unique perspectives and technical chapters that complement the rest of the book quite well.<br /><br />The first introduces ADAM, the \\"Active Defense Algorithm and Model,\\" which develops a methodology for network administrators to actively defend their networks against attacks. It's quite interesting, and brings together a number of risk models in an uncommon take. The authors are academic researchers from the University of Idaho, so it's a lot more academic than the previous material in Aggressive Network Self-Defense, but it formalizes a lot of the thinking that was present in the writing of the stories and techniques.<br /><br />The second is Tim Mullen's classic \\"Defending your right to defend.\\" This is the original position paper shared by Mullen with the information security community in 2002 or so. Here, Mullen makes a compelling case for actually striking back at worm infected hosts. After all, the position holds, someone should do something about them to help clean up the Internet. While it's a position I disagreed with at the time and still do, Mullen's writing is articulate and an important read. It really helps you understand a lot of the thinking that went into the book itself.<br /><br />Dan Kaminsky wrote the next chapter, \\"MD5 to be considered harmful someday.\\" Largely considered to be a follow-on to Joux and Wang's one-way hash function research, what it shows is how practical such an attack can be. Kaminsky never fails to come up with interesting ideas he putsinto practice, and he adds another level of depth to this book.<br /><br />Finally, Aggressive Network Self-Defense ends with an interesting paper, \\"When the tables turn: Passive strike-back.\\" Like any good paper, it has a clear and thoughtful motivation, and really demonstrates the principles at play, namely building network resources that don't simply lure the attacker in, they trip her up. There are so many ways to do this, the authors show us, and ultimately it's almost fun. A good way to end the book.<br /><br />An over-arching concern with the book that I have is the question of ethics. Mullen, in the foreword, states that he hopes the book stirs a debate about the ethics of the actions in the book. However, the book itself falls short in this area. Instead, sometimes the characters get busted, and sometimes they don't, but just because they didn't get caught doesn't mean some ethical lines weren't crossed. All too often the authors leave the ethical debate up in the air. While I prefer this to overt preaching or questions, the style leaves me wondering if this goal was achieved.<br /><br />So, where do I stand on Aggressive Network Self-Defense? In the end, I like it, more so than a book like Hacking Exposed or other \\"hacking how-to\\" types. The style of presentation doesn't lend itself all that well to exploring a very wide number of tools, but it does give you a deeper context to see how they assemble into something larger. For many people I expect it will be a page turner, and I think the format has some utility, as shown here.ideas he puts into practice, and he adds another level of depth to this book. <br /> <br />Finally, Aggressive Network Self-Defense ends with an interesting paper, \\"When the tables turn: Passive strike-back.\\" Like any good paper, it has a clear and thoughtful motivation, and really demonstrates the principles at play, namely building network resources that don't simply lure the attacker in, they trip her up.

US	46121444	R2SWCDOAGTO40H	0321173864	829611440	Bioinformatics in the Post-Genomic Era: Genome, Transcriptome, Proteome, and Information-Based Medicine	Books	3	14	16	N	N	decent intro, but not comprehensive or very usable	Bioinformatics is the science of biological information, namely sequences and metadata about organisms and sequences. What's interesting about this field to many people, both in the sciences and outside of it, is the large volume of data that gets analyzed and the results that emerge on a daily basis. Obviously interesting for the medical advances and the rapidly growing business in the life sciences, there's a complex field that has developed in the past ten years or so. And following the sequencing of the human genome, new challenges have arisen for everyone involved. Augen's Bioinformatics provides a good introduction to this new field of research for students in the sciences, and anyone with a decent undergraduate education in modern biology. I think that this accessibility of the material is one of the book's biggest winning points.<br /><br />After an introduction to the book and the subject area of bioinformatics (chapters 1 and 2), Augen begins at the level of the structure of a gene (chapter 3). Here, anyone with an undergraduate level understanding of genetics or molecular biology can begin using the book and bridging the gap to the new areas of modern bioinformatics. Augen then describes how basic sequence analysis is performed at the DNA sequence level (in chapter 4). The material in Bioinformatics covers some of the higher-level methods for sequence analysis, including hidden Markov models, neural networks, and pattern discovery, and introduces some of the common algorithms found to do this analysis.<br /><br />Chapter 5 then covers transcription, the process of going from DNA to mRNA. Beginning with the biology behind this activity (the ribosome and the larger \\"transcriptome\\"), Bioinformatics then describes how you would perform transcriptional analysis. Here, Augen shows how you go from a wet lab to a computational lab and describes what classes of experiments you perform to gather data and then what kinds of analysis you perform on it. This chapter introduces some of the more common clustering techniques for data aggregation and understanding.<br /><br />The next step in the DNA -> RNA -> protein chain is found in chapter 6, which covers the translation process. Coupled to chapter 7, which describes protein structure prediction and searching, these two chapters bridge the next gap between laboratory data and computational analysis. Protein folding and structure analysis was one of my pet areas of study as a graduate student, and Augen's text does a decent summarization of the field to date. The resources listed and techniques described are definitely on par with the common practices in the field.<br /><br />Finally, Bioinformatics gets into the next major area of bioinformatics, medical databases. Augen's bridge from genetics to medical science is complete, and he discusses how medical professionals utilize databases and can begin to predict disease, for example, based on data mining. The final chapter, \\"New Themes in Bioinformatics,\\" covers exactly that, but also what Augen refers to as \\"workflow computing,\\" or basically going about being a bioinformatics scientist. One of my favorite emerging areas in bioinformatics, metabolic pathway elucidation, is also covered briefly.<br /><br />I've shared this book with a few friends who are all studying computer science or practicing computer scientists. I did so because Augen's material does a good job of explaining my background and introducing them to some of the analysis forms I introduce into my own work. It does a good job of that, and gets them quite excited. Bioinformatics really bridges a number of fascinating areas of computer sciences, including data mining and high performance algorithms. Augen's Bioinformatics is a good introduction to the field for them, and really anyone who has studied a couple of biology courses in college.<br /><br />Where the book falls short, however, can be grouped into two main areas. The first is the failure of Augen's presentation of the algorithms. While the methods used to describe computational algorithms in Bioinformatics is common for non-computer scientists, it's completely unusable for computer scientists who are used to a specific algorithm presentation style that looks more like pseudocode than rambling text. The ambiguities this presents for a technical reader are unfortunate, especially if anyone studying bioinformatics is supposed to be computer science literate. The book itself assumes a life science literacy, so this isn't an unreasonable expectation of the reader.<br /><br />The second area that consistently falls short in the book is in the utility of the information given. While I am significantly happier with the quality and depth of material presented in Augen's book than in the O'Reilly bioinformatics series, where the book fails to deliver is in showing the reader how to actually use the data they gather. After all, the book shows various sequence analysis algorithms and discusses tools available to do this work, but it only devotes a few pages (out of over 370 in total) to a workflow that can be used. Also, the book fails to point the reader at very worthwhile web resources sometimes, including meta sites like the SDSC Biology Workbench site, and just says \\"some Perl scripts\\" for local data analysis. As such, you'll have to go a few extra miles on your own to make use of the data sources.<br /><br />I guess a third complaint of the book for me is that Augen has ignored or omitted significant bodies of research that fit squarely into the scope of the book. For example, Ken Dill's research into protein folding models, as well as Martin Karplus' work on the subject, receives no mention, nor does the topic of Bayesian network analysis when Augen discusses time series data analysis. These aren't new, they've been around for many years and influenced most of the field, and their absence is noted. The book's spotty coverage in some places, like these, is noticeable.<br /><br />Bioinformatics does a few things well, but overall reads too much like a biology textbook to be useful to the average computer scientist. More emphasis on the practice of bioinformatics and data analysis would have made this book stronger and complemented the substantive background material well. Finally, using an approach more similar to the computer science approach would have been a tremendous benefit, since the material really is computer science in part. That said, I think this is probably the best introduction to this exciting area of science that I have yet seen.s presentation of the algorithms.

Almost all of them are not computer security professionals, so it's imperative that our methods be usable by the non-professionals. What makes this even worse is that most computer users are not terribly savvy about what they're using. Terms like hard drives and memory don't mean anything to them, and a browser is just a window to the internet. A computer is a tool for information use, not an end in itself.<br /><br />So, a book like \\"Security Alert: Stories of Real People protecting Themselves from Identity Theft, Scams and Viruses\\" looked like it has real promise. If it can communicate threats and solutions effectively to the average computer user, then we're making real progress. After all, even computer security professionals often fail to employ basic measures to protect themselves from typical attacks, we'll have to make sure this<br /><br />stuff is understandable by the general population. Not that they're the \\"great unwashed\\", hardly.  They're just not focusing on this stuff. Hence, we have a challenge: make this stuff understandable by your mom if you want everyone to just get it.<br /><br />Becky Worley is (was?) a TechTV on-air personality. She's reported news and events for TechTV for a number of years, and has often done so clearly and at a level you'd expect for a general TV station devoted to technology issues. So, you'd think she'd be a in a great position to collect information and know how to present it. Sadly, Worley's book doesn't fit that niche, it's not going to educate the large masses. In putting myself in the shoes of an average computer user, I found it fails in a number of ways.<br /><br />The first and foremost failure of the book is right from the beginning. Worley opens up by saying that you're not a target of hackers, yet the rest of the book goes on to discuss how you are. While you're probably not going to be attacked by the same people who try and break in to US Pentagon computer networks, virus writers and con artists fall into the same category for most purposes. All of these sorts of people, and what they can do, is described in chapter 1.<br /><br />No discussion of phishing in all of the discussion in the chapter on identity theft, which is chapter 2. Identity theft is a large, complicated subject, yet Worley only focuses on credit card number theft. While she talks about social security numbers, she doesn't demonstrate how they have been used to destroy someone's lives. Some advice is given as to how to react to credit card theft, but little information is given here about how to protect yourself to begin with aside from being careful about who you<br /><br />give your SSN to.<br /><br />The book repeats itself often, covering material in several places. Chapter 3, which covers online purchasing, covers credit card info theft and email scams again. What it doesn't cover very well is how to spot a legitimate website, how to really use an escrow service, if and how you can get eBay or a shipper to help you out of a scan auction, or the like. Useful information about verifying who owns a certificate for an SSL server, or even making sure you're using an SSL server, is not given. Examples of false websites and auctions would have been useful. After all, after telling us how scammers operate and look so legitimate, illustrating the points about how to spot them would be valuable.<br /><br />The book is full of anecdotes but few useful pieces of information for people are placed where they need to be. Chapter 4, which covers viruses, is one of these examples. It spends most of its time covering typical viruses and the usual, but doesn't get into anything beyond \\"use antivirus software\\". Never mind that the biggest threat in recent years has been from automated worms and that personal firewalls are useful, that's covered later. We hope you remember the quick tutorial on viruses from<br /><br />before.<br /><br />The book's organization is poor, with material scattered throughout the book in a fashion that doesn't progress well or develop the information seamlessly. More virus and scam information is placed in Chapter 5, along with virus hoaxes. Several websites are given, but little in the way of really spotting a virus hoax or the common scam. Since they still abound, and people still fall prey to them, couldn't a better job have been done to describe what people are looking at have been offered?<br /><br />In short, the book is a decent collection of links and material but is so poorly organized or so thinly presented it's hard to get what's going on. Take chapters 6 and 7, \\"Safe and Sane Online Interactions\\" and \\"Protecting the Family.\\" Lots of information, somewhat poorly organized, and very skimpy on content. It seems to me that worrying about who is pestering my kids is more  important than hearing about someone's EverQuest addiction,<br /><br />so that was a wasted page.<br /><br />Finally, Chapters 8 and 9 should have been moved up front more. The topic of chapter 8, \\"Privacy\\", is perfect for the topics in chapter 2, where Worley talks about identity theft. The topics covered here, including spyware and key loggers, is far more germane to the threat against your privacy and bank account information, and has been a growing trend for at least a couple of years. Chapter 9, differentiating being safe and being<br /><br />paranoid, should have been placed up front to help temper the arguments given in the rest of the book. It does a decent job of articulating the threats, what's to fear, and what's at stake.<br /><br />The book is laden with plenty of anecdotes about online activities gone awry. What's missing are solid examples of how to do it right, how to use your credit card on trusted sites safely and ensure that you're using services you know are worthwhile. While the book has some useful information in it, it's buried under poor organization, unclear language and presentation, and finally repetition in all the wrong places.<br /><br />While the world needs a book or two to help every day people understand online security, this isn't the one. If you're looking for something for your kids, your spouse, or your parents, keep looking. This book wont help them make sense of what's going on. I don't think that's too much to ask for, especially from an organization like TechTV which has access to lots of material, people, and motive to produce a solid book.seful, that's covered later.

Still, I wanted to learn something new with it, and I wanted to see if this book could offer what I was hoping for. The book delivers, and does a pretty good job. One of the big tests for me about any book that covers an Open Source project is &quot;Does this book offer more than the existing documentation?&quot; If it fails to, the book isn't worth the money, I'll stick with free docs.<br />A bit of the book I didn't like was the choice of screenshots: quite a number of the screenshots were full screen dumps when only one or two elements of the page really mattered. Either trimmed or annotated screenshots would have been more welcome. A lot of information gets dumped in Ethereal, helping people navigate the UI with a static, black-and-white image would have been welcome.<br />Now, on to the real strengths of the book. The book offers more coverage than the existing, free docs on Ethereal provide, or at least in a more manageable form. Obviously, with the source code in front of me I could dissect the tool and learn everything about it, but that's hardly efficient. Simply put, the book introduces network sniffing and troubleshooting well. How can you place a sniffer to get coverage, what can a sniffer tell you during troubleshooting (and what can it not?), and of course how to get and install Ethereal (on UN*X and Windows).<br />The next chapter covers exactly what you would expect it to, how to use Ethereal. Ethereal's main use is as a GUI protocol analyzer, so you have menus, panes and windows to navigate. This chapter tells you what they are and how they present and format the data you're looking at. The next chapter deals with four tools that come with Ethereal: Tethereal (very similar to tcpdump), Editcap, Mergecap, and Text2pcap (all useful for managing pcap files).<br />Chapter 7 is one of those handy things to read. Ethereal is typically used to read pcap files, but it can also read snoop files, Microsoft Network Monitor files, EtherPeek files, NAI's Sniffer files, and HPUX's nettl files, all of which you'll find around. It's handy that you can see how to integrate Ethereal with these other products.<br />Chapter 8 brings it all together with real world packet captures, many of which are also on the included CD. These files include scans, Trojan uses, and even worm traffic. All of these are useful for learning how to use Ethereal and highlight the power of the tool. You can go from novice to a pretty decent network protocol junkie if you dilligently study the resources in this chapter and on the CD.<br />Chapter 9 will be useful to a small subset of people, but quite useful. This chapter gives you a tour of how to develop for and extend Ethereal. Ethereal's main strength is a huge number of decode routines, such as sFlow and MPLS (in addition to the standard ones like DNS, DHCP, and the like). Using this information you can extend Ethereal for your own needs and maybe even contribute back to the project.<br />Either the developer's angle or the detailed discussions and examples of the filter syntax are my favorite parts of the book. They contribute significant value for everyday use, and I found them useful in a recent task at work.<br />The book is going to run the risk of becoming quickly out of date, given the development pace of Ethereal. However, it relies more on underlying core concepts and principles inherent in Ethereal, so it should stay useful for longer than you may think. Also, Syngress has a book update feature that some people may find useful.but it can also read snoop files, Microsoft Network Monitor files, EtherPeek files, NAI's Sniffer files, and HPUX's nettl files, all of which you'll find around.

US	46121444	R3021FVYAZB2D8	0738206679	117060972	Linked: The New Science of Networks	Books	4	2	6	N	N	a great intro to modern network research	barabasi does a great job of bringing you up to speed on current networking stuff, really focusing on the great strides that have been made in the past decade or two from all sorts of fields. my only complaints about the book were that it's not technical enough, doesn't have enough technical pointers (citeseer is your friend), and really stops at \\"hey, everything follows a power law!\\" but that's appearantly barabasi's schtick, power laws and scale free networks, i'll have to look elsewhere for what the implications for that finding really are.<br />overall, a good introduction for the curious mind, but not nearly technical enough.	2002-11-21

Xerox's PARC experiences are at once fantastic achievements in computer science and computational products, but they are also failures in developing actual products. we see how gates and jobs scooped in and adapted many of the same technologies to win the market, and we learn how Xerox could have never made this happen for themselves.<br />all in all a very interesting, timely, and well written book.	2002-08-19

US	46121444	R3EJSWJ835V7W8	0198532873	702429717	Codes and Cryptography	Books	4	5	5	N	N	A great textbook on information theory and cryptography	This small gem caught my eye because of its publisher (Oxford, well known for publishing excellent textbooks on scientific subjects), and its simple title. 'Code and cryptography'. Nothing fancy or flashy. Having picked it up, I was pleased to see it's in the style of Shannon's 1948 paper which introduced the science of information theory. I'm especially grateful to the author for his judicious use of simple examples to illustrate complex topics, and when coupled to the clear mathematical language, this book is extremely effective at conveying the material.<br />Be forewarned, it is dense and heavy, and requires you to really get actively engaged in the material. The presentation of theorems is very textbook, which is useful, but nothing is handed to you so easily. Definitely go into it with a ready mindset, and a good grasp of basic mathematics. However, if you step up to it, it can be a very worthwhile exercise. The book's small size hides its power.<br />Highly reccomended.	2001-05-09
