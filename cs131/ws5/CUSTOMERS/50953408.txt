This is a short book about a small group of thieves who try to recover a truckload of stolen toys from *another* group of thieves.<br /><br />The \\"welcome\\" that the lead character gives to a group of carolers would be worth the price of the book by itself.<br /><br />This is a very short book, and the cover price is low to match the length, but you should buy it with some other books because Amazon's shipping charge would nearly double the cost of the book if you ordered it separately.<br /><br />I also recommend Heisler's earlier book, \\"An American Christmas,\\" a collection of 5 short stories.	2005-09-14

I've read all of his novels and both story collections. I even read his book of poems. (I haven't read his non-fiction yet, though.) <br /> <br />\\"Breaking Point\\" is like the best parts of a Peter Abrahams novel. Abrahams writes crime thrillers, and the best parts are often the setup rather than the parts where the guns and knives come out. What I mean is: those parts are fascinating and even suspenseful even without much violence (although the *threat* of violence is there). <br /> <br />This novel by Chris Fahy is like that too. <br /> <br />I hope I'm not making the book sound boring, because it isn't. <br /> <br />It's very suspenseful, and it isn't filled with preachy dialogue. You won't find pages and pages of speeches about the injustice of health care in America. <br /> <br />The suspense comes from a well-drawn group of characters and a good scenario.  <br /> <br />I didn't want any harm to come to any of the characters, even the kidnapper. (Well, maybe I wanted the doctor's wife to come to some harm in my darker moments.) I didn't want the victim to get hurt, but I also didn't want the kidnapper to get caught. (I didn't even want the kidnapper's wife to find out the crime even occurred.) <br /> <br />The premise of the novel is that a man and his wife both have lousy health insurance that won't cover a certain cancer treatment for the wife. Out of desperation, the man kidnaps someone and in a sense holds her for ransom. <br /> <br />I don't want to summarize the entire plot and spoil the book. Just get this book and read it. <br /> <br />And, more importantly, get Fahy's books \\"Nightflyer\\" and \\"The Lyssa Syndrome.\\" They're even better. Trample some old ladies and small children if you have to. If they read Fahy's books someday, they'll understand and forgive you. <br />  <br />	2005-09-01

I just finished reading \\"The Rising.\\"  <br /> <br />I can't recommend it. <br /> <br />A lot of people have praised Briane Keene here, but I don't think \\"The Rising\\" is anything special. <br /> <br />The most annoying thing about \\"The Rising\\" is the ending -- or rather the lack of one. <br /> <br />Ending the book with a cliffhanger is just a rotten thing to do. <br /> <br />It would be bad enough if the book only made you wait until the end to find out what happened to Jim's son, but even worse the novel just stops without telling you. <br /> <br />It doesn't even tell you what happened to Jim. <br /> <br />I'd be really angry, but for most of the second half of the book I didn't really care about the kid anymore. That plot thread just dragged on too long. <br /> <br />Maybe \\"The Rising\\" and \\"City of the Dead\\" should have been published as a single volume or at least published simultaneously. <br /> <br />The most interesting thing in the book is the demons that inhabit the zombies, but the book doesn't focus enough on them.  <br /> <br />There's way too much focus on the cartoonishly evil National Guard. <br /> <br />I already bought the sequel, \\"City of the Dead,\\" but I probably won't bother to read it. <br /> <br />I might just skim the beginning to find out what happened to Jim and his kid, but at the moment I don't even feel the urge. <br />	2005-08-30

My favorite stories are \\"Stille Nacht\\" (set during World War II) and \\"These Four Walls\\".   <br /> <br />The author has a good sense of humor and it's most evident in \\"These Four Walls\\" (the story about the kids and the 'witch'). <br /> <br />There's also some suspense in \\"Stille Nacht\\" and \\"The Long Road Home.\\"  (That surprised me even though I read and liked a few of the author's uncollected suspense stories.) <br /> <br />Three of the stories have spiritual elements. I normally wouldn't enjoy stories like that (outside of the horror genre), because I'm an atheist. It takes talent to make an ornery guy like me appreciate a sentimental and spiritual Christmas-themed story. <br /> <br />I'm looking forward to a book of Heisler's suspense and horror tales.	2004-08-18

That weirdness makes it pretty funny at times.  <br />The strange dialogue is a highlight.  Not only do characters say very shocking, inappropriate things to authority figures, even the authority figures say shocking, inappropriate things. (Priests, psychiatrists.)  <br />The novel doesn't really hold together well.  It's split into halves, one for each main character.  The two main characters don't interact.  Even within a half, the story is episodic; there isn't much of an overall plot, as far as I remember.<br />I think the author should comb through this book looking for interesting pieces to harvest and reuse in some other form.  Unfortunately, the publisher might own the copyright.  Oh well.<br />This book is more in line with &quot;The Fly Must Die&quot; and &quot;Fever 42&quot; than with &quot;Eternal Bliss&quot; and &quot;The Lyssa Syndrome.&quot;<br />Disclaimer: It's been a *long* time since I read this book.

I expected paintings of aliens and supernatural creatures.  Instead I got art that's nonsense,  from my point of view.  The paintings look nice, but they're meaningless to me.  I think that Giger needs better ideas for the subject matter of his paintings. Also, Giger's obsession with sex seems juvenile to me. <br />One of the few things I liked in the book was a sketch of a kid ringing a doorbell while another kid drops a guillotine blade toward the neck of the woman who stuck her head out the window to see who was at the door.<br />This book includes the two \\"Necronom\\" paintings that inspired the makers of \\"Alien\\" to hire Giger as designer of the alien, but if you're looking for artwork related to \\"Alien,\\" there's a separate book for that.

Most of the stories are set in Maine. One (\\"Ride\\") is set in Philadelphia.     The stories show the conflict between locals and \\"summer people\\"; between wealthy people and poor; between black people and white; between old and young; between gay and straight. Some stories show the difficulties of aging or illness.    I agree with the previous reviewer who praised \\"Detour\\".  It's a great story about a childless man who tries to protect a little girl from her unstable family members.    \\"Uncle Cub at Paradise Fair\\" is very funny at times. The behavior of some of the characters is so appalling that it's also darkly funny.    \\"The Tip\\" is an affecting story showing the same event from two different points of view. It probably should seem corny or preachy, but the author manages to avoid those pitfalls.    You might be surprised how much tension there can be in a story set in Maine (particulary since they lack supernatural elements). \\"The Best in the World\\", \\"Detour\\", \\"A Clock in San Diego\\", and \\"Holly Point\\" stand out in my mind as tense stories.    The book is a nicely-designed trade paperback.  My first copy was missing four pages. My next copy was fine, though.    I enjoyed the book. Hopefully it will be followed by an anthology of fantasy and suspense stories. I'd also like to read another of the author's suspense novels.	2001-01-11
US	50953408	R9OXPH5QWYGI7	0595006930	954697196	Nightflyer	Books	4	3	3	N	N	A great horror novel about out-of-body experiences	A great horror novel about a boy who can separate his spirit from his body. During his out-of-body experiences, he has some of the powers of a ghost. His spirit can fly and pass through solid objects. He is invisible but he can see and hear.<br />The characterizations of the boy, Jonathan Petrie, and his father, Doug, are particularly well done. Jonathan is in conflict with his parents, teachers, and the school bullies. First he uses his ability only as a temporary escape, exhilarated by the sensation of flying. Then he uses it in self-defense, and eventually for revenge against those he feels have hurt him.<br />The story is fast-paced and engrossing with a large cast of characters.<br />This novel would probably make a great gift for anyone who was a fan of the young-adult horror novels of R.L. Stine or Christopher Pike but has since outgrown them.	2001-01-08

This triggers a sort of mid-life crisis for Peter and he literally tells his boss to take his job and shove it. He decides to move (with his family), open his own business, and sculpt in his spare time.<br />Unfortunately, the unscrupulous real-estate agent hid the fact that many people had died on the property. Peter finds Satanist 'paraphernalia' there (a Satanic Bible, a ritualistic robe, a shrine, the previous owners' journal -- and some very gruesome things which I won't mention and spoil the story for you). Afterward, he struggles with his business and the restoration of the house. Peter becomes obsessed with the journal. Tensions run high among Peter, his wife, and his son. Some sort of explosion seems inevitable.<br />Fahy's story was unpredictable, particularly during the first half. Fahy keeps alive the mystery about just what is happening to the Willis family for a good part of the novel. There is also a very tense, suspenseful chase during the climax.<br />Fans of Stephen King's &quot;The Shining&quot; would probably enjoy this book a lot. (Don't worry. Fahy's novel is not a clone of King's novel. &quot;Dream House&quot; is similar to &quot;The Shining&quot; to the extent that King's &quot;Salem's Lot&quot; is similar to Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;.)<br />I almost gave the story 4 stars (rather than 3), but it's probably just a little too long.	2001-01-08

Most of the story focuses on just two characters on a small island. Stephen King managed to write a great novel about a celebrity and his kidnapper (&quot;Misery&quot;). Fahy's novel isn't quite as well-paced.	2001-01-08

Most of the stories are set in Maine. One (\\"Ride\\") is set in Philadelphia. <br />The stories show the conflict between locals and \\"summer people\\"; between wealthy people and poor; between black people and white; between old and young; between gay and straight. Some show the difficulties of aging or illness.<br />I agree with the previous reviewer that praised \\"Detour\\". It's a great story about a sterile man (?) who tries to protect a little girl from her unstable family members.<br />\\"Uncle Cub at Paradise Fair\\" is very funny at times. The behavior of some of the characters is so appalling that it's also darkly funny.<br />\\"The Tip\\" is an effecting story showing the same event from two points of view. It probably should seem corny or preachy, but the author manages to avoid those pitfalls.<br />You might be surprised how much tension there can be in a story set in Maine (particulary since they lack supernatural elements). \\"The Best in the World\\", \\"Detour\\", \\"A Clock in San Diego\\", and \\"Holly Point\\" stand out in my mind as tense stories.<br />I enjoyed the book. Hopefully it will be followed by an anthology of fantasy and suspense stories. I'd also like to read another of the author's suspense novels.	2001-01-08

It is also surprisingly touching at times. <br />Be patient through the first 20 or so pages. They are confusing because the narrator refers to characters and events that occur later in the book without any explanations. The narrator is very confused at the beginning. Once the narrator's mind clears, after the first chapter, the storyline is perfectly clear and very entertaining.<br />I eagerly await the publication of &quot;Fever 42&quot;, the novel mentioned in the 'About the Author' section of this book.	2001-01-08

Fast paced, engrossing, and clever.  It is so good that I still think about it eight years after reading it.  The Philadelphia Library lost the copy I read so I hunted down a used copy at a flea market just so I could lend it to other people.  <br />It's been eight years so I can't give a detailed description of it without skimming through my copy.  I don't want to do that.  I'm *glad* I'm forgetting the story.  It will make it more fun to read again.  <br />It's more of a medical thriller than a horror novel.  There is nothing supernatural in the book.<br />If you can find a copy, read this book. It should have been a bestseller. The only thing I didn't like about it was the original cover.  <br />Horror or medical thriller fans will love it.	1998-08-02
