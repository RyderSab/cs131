The quality of the contents varies from accomplished journeyman to fan fiction. The exception would be Kevin A. Ross' \\"The Music of the Spheres\\". Enschewing the usual compendium of obscure references and self-consciously purple prose employed by other would-be mythos authors, this story evokes truly Lovecraftian cosmic horror. For me this story is one of the best examples of modern mythos fiction and deserving of a place in one of the canonical Arkham House collections.	2005-08-03

There are books which sweep me along to an inevitable conclusion: some conclusions are more satisfying than others. Then there are books which I just persevere with because *surely* something interesting will eventually happen.  <br /> <br />The Alien Years plot synopsis: <br /> <br />The Aliens arrive (we don't know why)... and then, some several hundred pages later, they leave (for some equally unknown reason). <br /> <br />What a bore! Lifeless stereotypical characters struggling fruitlessly. Maybe it's supposed to be a metaphor for something.

In contrast, these novels are rarely sad and never dull and are generously fruited with some delightfully comic moments. <br /> <br />A literary masterpiece? Not really.

I enjoyed the exploration of the time travel paradox. But to describe it as \\"one of the best science fiction novels ever written\\" is to realize why science fiction is so rarely taken seriously as literature. <br /> <br />On the credit side, the plot is passable. The time-traveller paradox is handled thoughtfully and there are no glaring logical inconsistencies. The pacing is slow at the beginning but picks ups about a third of the way into the book. There's also a cat. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the debit side would have to include the absence or mishandling of everything else one would look for in a book. The terrible characterisations call for particular comment. The narrator is annoyingly egotistical: he seems to think that the world revolves around him--which of course, in this story, it does. To call the supporting characters cardboard cut-outs doesn't do justice to the expressive power of cardboard. The treatment of the two main female characters--one a traitorous, well-developed, vixen and the other a twelve-year-old child--seems especially awkard, even given that the book was written in the 1950s.  <br /> <br />Finally, there's the distinctly distasteful whiff of paedophilia in the relationship between the narrator and the daughter of his best friend, the afore-mentioned twelve-year-old child whom the narrator marries at the end of the story. <br /> <br />A mixed bag, this book has some elements to enjoy and many more simply to endure.	2005-05-18

One learns, for example, that when the thirteenth Dalai Lama sought Russian and British protection against the Chinese at the start of the twentieth century, he addressed the rulers of these lands with the honorific names of the Buddhist figure which indicated their natural roles. The Russian czars were considered to be emanations of Tara and Queen Victoria an emanation of Pelden Lhamo, an extremely fierce looking protector deity especially revered by the Dalai Lama's Gelugpa lineage.<br />The author received a joint doctorate between the departments of Far Eastern Languages and Sanskrit and Indian Studies from Harvard in 1972. He lived in India for twenty-nine years, studying under his main teacher, Tsenzhab Serkong Rinpochey, and other lamas, including His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<br />This book should be required reading for anyone seriously preparing to embark on the path of the Vajrayana.	2001-11-16

Like Cowan's book, it is a fascinating fable. I'm not particularly troubled over the question of how much of it is \\"true.\\" I wasn't particularly looking for any great revelations and so I was not disappointed not to find any. Nonetheless, there is a lot of wisdom here.     Did the author \\"make it all up?\\"--whatever that might mean. I often find myself asking myself the same question about Gurdjieff. My own view is that Gurdjieff was a highly realized being, but that the trail went cold on his passing. According to the author of this book, his last words to his disciples were, \\"What a fine mess I've left you in.\\" Indeed.	2001-11-16

I assumed that this book would consist of short topics related to the world of Harry Potter with room to record one's own thoughts below. Well, nearly. The book is nicely printed and bound on good paper. The layout is attractive. Unfortunately, the topics are very sketchy. For example, one page contains &quot;My best friends,&quot; underneath is printed &quot;Ron, Hermione.&quot; Well, duh. In many cases, it will require participation and some imagination on the part of the parent to elaborate on the topic sufficiently to fire the kid's imagination.

In particular, the character of the deliciously wicked Oliver Haddo, based on the infamous Aleister Crowley, &quot;the wickedest man alive,&quot; jumps off the page. However, like Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot; (a book that in structure &quot;The Magician&quot; resembles more than a little) the plot can sag slightly when the villain is off-stage. Luckily, this is never for more than a handful of pages.<br />Still surprisingly fresh and readable nearly a hundred years after its first publication, this book will appeal as much to the literate horror fan as to the typical &quot;Twentieth Century Classics&quot; reader.	2001-11-01

Lovecraft	Books	2	10	12	N	N	Mediocre	Lovecraft &quot;tribute&quot; volumes appear to be developing into a sub-genre all of their own and this book is...definitely one of them. I leave it to the English major to define the difference between pastiche and plagiarism, to distinguish between stories influenced by, written in homage to, or containing ideas directly stolen from Lovecraft. All these are represented in this volume, as well as a couple of tales that seem to have no connection to Lovecraft's work at all.<br />Of the thirteen stories collected within, four or five are memorable. Three of the stories--arguably the three best--Gene Wolfe's genuinely chilling &quot;Lord of the Land&quot;, Gahan Wilson's whimsical fantasy &quot;H.P.L.&quot;, and F. Paul Wilson's &quot;The Barrens&quot;--have also more recently appeared in the Arkham House collection &quot;Cthulu 2000.&quot; Also worthy of mention is Brian McNaughton's darkly humorous &quot;Meryphillia&quot;, possibly more reminiscent of Clarke Ashton Smith's oeuvre than of Lovecraft's, and Mort Castle's Poe-esque &quot;A Secret of the Heart.&quot;<br />There is a touchingly affectionate introduction by Robert Bloch and a short afterword by each author, sharing a little of what Lovecraft meant to him (unsurprisingly, all the authors are &quot;hims&quot;).<br />If you have already read the three volumes of Lovecraft's work in print, the collection of his revisions &quot;The Horror In The Museum And Other Tales,&quot; the two Arkham House tribute volumes &quot;Tales Of The Cthulu Mythos&quot; and &quot;Cthulu 2000,&quot; and you still want more, perhaps this book will fit the bill.	2001-10-29

The result is that the present volume preserves a stronger flavor of Trungpa's teaching style. On the other hand, the talks in this book were intended for a more advanced audience who were presumed to be already familiar with the material presented in the earlier book.<br />My experience of Trungpa's books has always been one of a cumulative effect. It helps to read, to practice, to read again, and to practice some more. The extraordinary nature of the teachings grow clearer with time and practice, although sometimes very little comes through on the first reading.	2001-10-24

This book is a wonderful, authoritative and comprehensive account of the path of Vajrayana Buddhism, as expounded by one of the greatest teachers of the last (20th) century.<br />I would only add that this book is perhaps not ideal for the complete novice. The teachings are presented in a rather dry, traditional style. People without some previous exposure to Tibetan Buddhist teachings might find the material somewhat confusing. Those interested in a more easily readable introduction to this topic might first try Sogyal Rinpoche's &quot;The Tibetan Book Of Living And Dying&quot; or Lama Surya Das' &quot;Awakening The Buddha Within&quot; before returning to this volume.	2001-10-24

Magical realism might come close. Personally, I would prefer weird fiction.<br />The Tooth Fairy is a clearly observed narrative of growing up in rural England in the sixties and seventies. An ordinary boy, with all the ordinary problems and joys of adolescence, receives irregular visits from a extraordinary creature, at first wild and terrifying, later strangely sympathetic.<br />The prose is crisp, the pace is brisk, the characters are well drawn, and the invocation of time and place were, for me, achingly nostalgic.

On the plus side, there are a number of chuckles and the plot is very compelling. On the down side, a large majority of the jokes are about masturbation, the character development is mostly sketchy, and the plot is often ludicrously contrived with most of the interest in whether Nick will ever finally get it on with the stuck-up, manipulative Sheeni. (You could do sooo much better, Nick!) <br />A few nice turns of phrase here and there were very welcome, but not enough to place the author in a league with the truly great humorous writers, such as PG Wodehouse or Douglas Adams.

Encouraged by his high opinion of this book and a couple of favorable reviews here, I decided to purchase it. The first couple of chapters are quite promising, and one certain sees the germs of several ideas that are later developed to much better effect by Lovecraft in his stories, particularly evidently in The Lurking Fear and The Rats In The Walls. Unfortunately, the book begins to ramble very early. Several disparate--and, it has to be said, not very interesting--themes are introduced and then just dropped, resulting in the kind of story the guy in the movie Memento might have written if he had been a hack writer trying to support his opium habit, paid by the word by some third rate 30's pulp magazine. As is common in this genre, character development is minimal and the prose style is no better than serviceable with a few interesting archaisms.<br />It is very rare that I do not finish a book once got past the first couple of chapters, especially one as short as this. However, I found nothing here to hold my interest through to the end. This book is of historical interest only. Fans of Lovecraft with other than a purely academic interest in the writers who influenced him should turn instead to the superb ghost stories in MR James' &quot;Ghost Stories of an Antiquary&quot;.	2001-10-19

Always stimulating and often quite arousing, though rarely very  specific or detailed, the book consist of a selection of short interviews  with women who are not at all shy about talking about their (seemingly very  active) sex lives. <br />The author makes a point of asking each interviewee  the fastest way to get her into bed. The most common response would seem to  be, say hello, get me drunk, and make me laugh. Well, duh! Notwithstanding  this advice, this is not a &quot;how to get laid&quot; manual. Unless I've  led a much more sheltered life than I realized, these are women of somewhat  - unusual - tastes and I would say the odds of running into anyone with  these inclinations are pretty slim outside of a handful of specialist bars  in one the larger metropolises.<br />Assuming the author didn't just make up  these characters, and the variations in tone would imply that this is not  the case, I was left wondering exactly how he met these women. I would  guess through ads in alternative news weeklies, swingers' magazines, etc.  Can you say self selected sample? No big deal. There is no attempt at  (social) scientific method or any other socially redeeming quality, this  book just good, smutty fun, and a useful reminder of the almost infinite  variety of human desire.<br />And the cover photo is pretty cool.	1999-12-06

As the historian  Arnold Toynbee wrote, &quot;The coming of Buddhism to the West may well  prove to be the most important event o the twentieth century.&quot;<br />This  book is not an introduction to Buddhism, a Buddhism 101. If you're looking  for an overview of the beliefs and practices of Buddhists, there are many  more appropriate texts available. My personal recommendation would be Lama  Surya Das' Awakening the Buddha Within : Tibetan Wisdom for the Western  World. In contrast, the book under discussion is a provocative attempt to  reinterpret and (re)introduce the core of the Buddhist teachings to the  west, in a form easily understood and assimilated by the western student.  Just as Christ wasn't a Christian, the Buddha Sakayamuni was not a  Buddhist: he was a teacher, a spritual friend. His teachings have been  filtered through thousands of years of history an individual cultural  circumstances. This is one more take. The book resonates strongly with me.  Perhaps it will with you, too.	1999-11-21

I try to keep two copies of this book on hand so I always have one to give to a friend.	1997-12-16
