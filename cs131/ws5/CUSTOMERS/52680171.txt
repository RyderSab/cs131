US	52680171	R2HJ2QRAOJTPMH	0670894605	378345448	The Secret Life of Bees	Books	5	6	7	N	Y	Proof that simple is beautiful	Sue Monk Kidd is, first and foremost, a tremendously gifted writer. She tells Lily's heartbreaking story in the most rational, credible way imaginable. Her characters instantly become people the reader would like to bring home for tea . . . for honey cake.<br />There are so many aspects of this book that left me in awe, it's hard to know where to begin, what to include here. Kidd has remarkable insight into the lives of Lily, a hardscrabble 14-year-old from rural South Carolina, her sweet and bumbling nanny Rosaleen, seasoned sage August, cooly aloof June, and the overly compassionate and responsive May. Their unlikely meeting and merger into the truest kind of family is unlikely (especially in early 1960s Carolina) but Kidd makes it believable nonetheless. It's just too heartwarming to dismiss as fantasy. As if to defend the novel's somewhat unlikely plot, the narrator Lily tells readers at the end: \\"Look at me. I dived into one absurd thing after the other, and here I am . . . I wake up to wonder every day\\".<br />The theme of motherly love is thick in this novel. If nothing else, Kidd illustrates that maternal influence is not one of the dispensible facets of our lives--even if it means looking to someone other than the woman who gave us initial life. In a retreat back to her roots in religious studies, Kidd entwines a fascinating worship of Mary into Lily's life. Mary, mother of thousands, is one Lily looks to most during her darkest hours. The inclusion of a Christian yet beautifully feminine worship is the rock solid core of this lovely novel.<br />Though a compact 300 pages, this novel is full of heartache, joy, laughter, and realizations. It isn't to be taken lightly. Everything--the rural Carolina setting, the social upheavel of the Civil Rights Movement (also a major factor in plot development), and the beatiful coming-of-age story--is exquisitely developed by Kidd. It's not to be missed!	2002-06-26
US	52680171	R3VMBL4QYRDSQL	0385491069	153232466	The Edible Woman	Books	5	4	5	N	N	Atwood is a genious	Many authors who have risen to the heights of fame and acclaim that Atwood has reached have forgettable first novels, but Atwood is a clear exception to that. The Edible Woman is brazen, thought-provoking,and amusing all at the same time. <br />Marian McAlpin is a recent college graduate living in an unnamed Canadian city. She began dating Peter, an attorney, just as she started her job as a copy writer at a marketing research firm. Before she even realized that their relationship was serious or \\"going somewhere\\", she and Peter become engaged. Strangely enough, it happens after a fit of anxiety that literary causes Marian to run frantically into the night, away from Peter and the possibility of captivity.<BR>The wedding plans are hastily taken over by Marian's family, the plans for the rest of their life are taken over by Peter (plans that included Marian quiting her job and becoming a housewife) and Marian begins to feel consumed. <br />Marian's onset of food aversions are comical, but also very symbolic--the thought of being coldly and methodically consumed keeps Marian from eating during the weeks leading up to her wedding as she tries to imagine giving up her independence. <br />Nearly every aspect of this novel is a symbol, a cultural comment of some kind. The most obvious, of course, is about food, but there are others, including the deep pit Marian stares into just days before her wedding. The characters are also neatly compartmentalized into varying degrees of traditional stagnation. They range from the stodgy old sexless landlady; the 3 \\"office virgins\\" at Marian's company; Clara, a college friend who is deeply immersed in the doldrums of wifery and motherhood; and the scheming Ainsley, Marian's roommate who plots to become pregnant with the help of an unsuspecting man. Peter, Marian's fiancee, openly balks at marriage at the novel's beginning; however, superb plot development shows that men have nothing to lose and everything to gain. It's the wife-to-be who is expected to surrender everything. Not-so-subtle remarks about uppity women who \\"trap\\" men by becoming pregnant (like Ainsley and the wife of Peter's friend Trigger) and about the perils of educating women (it's a risk to allow them to get ideas, you see) make this novel all the more wonderful. <br />This is not a lightweight novel, in spite of its somewhat silly subject matter and hilarious plot twists. Only those who go in with their eyes wide open will finish this novel having been enriched and satisfied.	2002-05-23

US	52680171	R52H4HIDTBLVN	067091021X	43461769	Year of Wonders: A Novel of the Plague	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Brilliantly crafted	Journalists have a knack for writing wonderful fiction--especially historical fiction.  The gift of words comes easily, the research is adequately completed, and the details are written in a way to transport the reader.  This novel took me immedately to 17th century England.  <br />Anna Frith, at the ripe old age of eighteen, finds herself a widow with two very young sons.  When an affable man knocks on her door one day offering money in exchange for room and board, she thinks God has sent her an end to her destitution.  She couldn't have been more wrong, for that man, a traveling tailor, brings Plauge to Anna's tiny Derbyshire village.  He is the first to die, followed quickly by Anna's children.  The rest of the novel is a haunting description of the tumult that Anna and her neighbors endured during that terrible year, 1665-1666.  <br />Anna herself, under the guidance of her boss and confidant Elinor Mompellion, helps ease the suffering as best she can with herbs and ointments.  She emerges as something of a heroine, though her sacrifices are largely unrecognized by her peers.  Because Anna's life becomes so entwined with the lives of her neighbors, the reader is able to get an all-encompassing look at the horrors of an entire village, not just one person.  Anna's neighbors become almost as real and cherished as she herself does as this novel progresses.  <br />My favorite aspect of this book is Anna's religious perception of the events of the Plague year.  Though a devout Christian (her Master Michael Mompellion is the town rector), Anna slowly accepts the Plague as something of nature, not of God, and places more emphasis on the healing powers of herbals and other concoctions deemed devilish by her more devout acquaintances.  At the novels end, Anna finds her niche in the world of medicine, healing, and midwifery.  <br />Brooks' attention to detail in this book is astounding.  As only a journalist could, she reports everything from the style of dress to the color of the landscape to the varying religious oddities of her neighbors.  This book is a rare treasure in the world of historical fiction, and I can't recommend it any more enthusiastically.	2002-05-06

Though the novel's scenario is obviously speculative (little is known about Vermeer's private life), I still feel quite comfortable calling it \\"historical fiction\\" because the author clearly took such pains to recreate everything as accurately as possible. I quite easily transportd myself to a 17th century Delft town, where I could see the people going about their daily chores. The imagery in this book is intense but not forced--and that is a clear demonstation of the writer's talent. Chevalier vividly conjures images of every detail, from the clothing styles to the prevailing sense of servitude that enveloped the novel's heroine. The way she managed to verbally describe Vermeer's attention to light, texture, and shadows amazes me.<br />The characters in this novel, I feel, are beautifully developed. Griet emerges at the end with a clear sense of survival, when she could have succumbed to defeat and humiliation. The tension betweend Catholics and protestants is yet another detail that makes Chevalier's imagined world seem real. <br />Vermeer eluded historians for centuries. Tracy Chevalier has given him a life that may be as close to the \\"truth\\" as anyone will ever be. I'll never look at a Vermeer painting the same way again.	2002-05-02

The main character, Molly Bolt, defies all gender roles and traditional expectations of women. She announced as a child that she would never marry any man, but she later considered marrying her 6th grade girlfriend. Rita Mae Brown mastered the art of compare/contrast; her inclusion of several \\"good girl\\" characters made Molly's determination all the more delightful and refreshing. Molly's strengths go beyond the simple fact that she was gay and proud. You go, girl!!	2002-04-15

Not only was it the sprout of a whole new genre(what we now know as &quot;journalistic novels&quot; or &quot;creative nonfiction&quot;) but it's well-written and provocative.

I don't believe it's meant to be read as a novel, but rather as a series of vignettes about individuals, moments, feelings, and emotions of &quot;ordinary people&quot; during the tumultuous post-WWII Czech Republic.  That part of the novel is delightful and a breath of fresh air; it's real history painted with delicate attention to detail instead of the broad, sweeping strokes of historians who have a habit of focusing on well-known dissidents and politicians.  I've never read other books by Kundera, so perhaps my interpretation is skewed.  However, I have visited Prague and this book satiated the thirst I've had to scratch beneath the surface of the touristic atomosphere that has taken over there.  Read this book, and imagine that the people you encounter on the streets in Prague likely remember the oppression and misery Kundera speaks of in these pages.	2002-04-14

I read this wonderful novel in 1997 and even then, I drew immediate parallels with the Taliban's treatment of Afghan women.  Atwood creates a real man's world, where women are only vessels for babies.  Offred (Of FRED--the name of her master), the narrator, is intelligent and observant, but limited to the narrow confines of the life dicated by the new government.  She lives her daily life unaware of the fate of her child and tortures herself by wandering by the execution wall to see if any of the new dead could be her precious husband.  This novel presents a life unfathomable to Western women, but I think all of us owe it to our less fortunate sisters to read it, and to try to place ourselves in that world, if only for an afternoon.	2002-04-03

Just as the back cover says, Chloe Plus Olivia is &quot;certain to become the reference point from which all subsequent studies of lesbian writing will begin&quot;.  Lillian Faderman has done a wonderful job (and a great deal of homework) putting together this compendium of lesbian work.  There are a few things, however, one should realize about this book. It only contains excerpts, not necessarily entire works--for obvious reasons, as she often cites novels.  Therefore, it should be treated as a reference guide, not a source of great lesbian literature.  Secondly, Faderman admits she dealt only with European and North American writers.  I'm not faulting her for this; I simply wanted to point out that there are no selections from Asians, Latinas, or Native American writers.  My favorite aspect of this book is that it contains interpretation and criticism.  Though I'm perfectly capable of doing that myself, I always eagerly devour other scholars' opinions, especially in this particular area of study.  Ms. Faderman introduced hours of new reading besides the obvious Willa Cather and Audre Lourde--but I still had to go to the library and get the actual books.	2002-04-03

I find O'Connor's stories to be the best, most brutally honest, thought-provoking and attitude-altering work out there.  One piece deserving of mention are the classic &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;, the last line of which reasonates long after the reader closes the book.  O'Connor craftily delivers messages about racism, elitism and other problems of the deep South in her stories, and beautifully maintains the Southern Gothic texture in each one.

I recognize her as one of the most gifted young writers of my time and fully expect her to rise to the ranks of Toni Morrison and Alice Walker.

This is one of them.  Lucille Clifton has a magical, inexplicable way bring the most unpoetic subjects to life--including incest, racism, Lucifer, Eve, and the human body.  Clifton's poems exude truth and she isn't afraid to write from the somewhat underrepresented perspective of an African American woman.  Even the poems that seem to have a narrow audience (Wishes for Sons, To my Last Period) manage to have a universal quality about them. I've been extremely fortunate to hear her read twice--the only thing that improves upon the purchase of this book is hearing the sublime Ms. Clifton in person.  Her voice captivates and reasonates from the pages of her books.  Anyone who finds these poems offensive should consider the element of truth in each and every one of them.	2002-03-19

I was desperate for any and all information I could get, since none of my friends or anyone in my immediate social circle had gone to law school.  I devoured this book, particularly the portion that describes different areas of law and the expected rate of advancement, reasonable starting salary expectations, etc.  However, this book is no substitute for touring a law school, talking to students and faculty, and doing some more creative research.

I think it's ingenious that Ensler tells the story from an American perspective.  As an American woman, I've never spent a single day or night in the midst of a warzone--and bombs and shells are a minute portion of what Bosnian women endured.  Melissa's distance and J.S.'s transformation make it very clear how removed we Americans can be from the attrocities of war.  Ensler is right--we only think about the bombs, bloodshed, and battles.  Because the media tends to ignore the drudgeries and aftermaths, we do as well.  Maybe I thought at first that this play was missing the noisy, concrete aspects of war.  But it's the abstract--the emotional and mental damage--that people need to consider.  Ensler brings that aspect of war hauntingly close with this play.	2002-03-11

This book, however, should have ended one or two foster homes before it did--it really got tiring after the third or fourth home.  Some things I don't understand:  Was Ray supposed to be some kind of Jesus figure?  He had it all from the long dark blonde hair, sad eyes, and he was a CARPENTER.  Just curious.  Also:  for all the beautiful imagely and breathtaking descriptions, this book is LOADED with run-on sentences and comma splices.  What kind of editor signed off on this mess? My final verdict is this:  I love the idea of this book, but it's obviously a first novel.  I think Fitch lost control of the flow of the plot, let it get too long-winded and didn't flesh out all of her themes.	2002-03-09

Unlike Fauziya Kassindja (author of Do They Hear You When You Cry), Dirie actually did submit to the horrifying surgery at age five.  She lived to tell about it, and she does so in a mesmerizing way.  With vivid attention to detail Dirie provides an insider's view of the plight of African women, millions of whom are forced to be \\"circumsised\\" in order to be appealing to a prospective husband.  Although she escaped to a life of prestige and privledge, Dirie is no stranger to hard work and hard times.  Not even her supermodel status assuages the emotional and mental distress caused by her circumsision.    She reiterates countless times that she is one of the lucky few--most of her fellow African women will never experience life without pain.  Their story is the one worth reading within this book, and Dirie tells it beautifully.	2002-01-30

I think this novel would have been strengthened had Schwarz not tried so hard to make it seem more complicated then it had to be.
