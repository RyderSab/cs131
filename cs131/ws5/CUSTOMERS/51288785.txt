I enjoyed tionne's book of poetry and essays...as i was sitting reading her book i knew that she had to go through a lot of trials and tribulations to get where she is emotionally and spiritually. i'm glad that i picked up this book and read it.  i feel so great now knowing that im not the only one who is going through hard times dealing with death, weight, insecurities with how i look and act, etc etc...and that life is too short. live life to the fullest and worry about tomorrow when and/or if it gets here later.   <br />thanks tionne for your words of wisdom. tboz has a beautiful voice inside and out. :)	2004-05-24

First of all, I would like to say that im not a avid wrestling fan, i watch both WWF and WCW. i work in a library, and love to read about other people lives and how they became who they are. and to read Dewayne  Johnson's autobiography and how he became a professional wrestler blew my  mind. he came a long way. i liked the fact that he pushes for what he  wants, and didn't let anything stand in his way, and the fact that he  played football in high school and college...graduated from University of  Miami with a degree in criminology and had his ups and downs with  football...he still came out on top. i believe Dewayne Johnson has his on  identity and yes he had some good connections to help him get into the  wrestling business. we all have some type of good connections to get us  where we want to go...but the bottom line is this...i found out more about  Dewayne Johnson and The Rock than if i didnt read the book... they are  smart, witty, and well educated to know what they both want even though  they are two different personalities. you really have to read the book word  for word to understand that Dewayne is telling the reader that he is just  an ordinary person that loves to wrestle.<br />So don't compare Dwayne  Johnson's book to Mick Foley's book because they are two different people  and share probably different views on things.	2000-02-11
