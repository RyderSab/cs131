This book is about the different stories that Eva Luna tells her lover. There is no need to read [[ASIN:0553280589 Eva Luna]],though it is helpful because both combined complete a fantastic tale.	2003-12-23

This book of poetry is very interesting, on the left pages we have the poems in English and  on the right we have the poem in Spanish. The comparison is very interesting and it is fun to decipher which was the original language of the poem. It seems they were all written in Spanish first, but I'm not sure.<br />The translations into English are excellent and sometimes (rarely) the poem is better in English than in Spanish.<br />Some poems are really good, and others are well, bad amd boring.<br />I recommend this book because the comparison and contrast of the two languages is extremely interesting.	2003-12-23

A literary critic says that Marquez has \\"written the white page in history\\". The book brings Bolivar out of its pedestal and presents him as a more humane person inflicted by a disease. The book is sometimes boring and the language is dense. There is a lot of symbolism that proves vital at the end. The end product is very satisfying but reading the book might prove to some to be boring.<br /><br />The book makes us think about what is true and what is fiction. How much of Bolivar do we really know? Has the legend overshadowed the person?<br />I really recommend this book, is a good read.	2003-12-23

The first story , \\"La mala influencia\\" is really good and present a satirical situation of the problem that exists when puertorricans raise in the United States culturally clash with their roots. This is basically the message of the book: it deals with the new generation, the children of puertorrican immigrants and the battle they must fight between choosing their parents culture or the popular culture of the time.

The blatant display of infidelity doesn't seem to upset the wife so much anyways. To tell you the truth this book is not that good. It's literary value is diminished by how the author's portrayal of the characters. They are flimsy, not well developed and devoid of anything that makes them interesting.	2003-04-14
