No interiors, no technical information, but it will be very interesting to those in the market for business jets, either as owner, FBO, broker, etc.	2000-10-26

I felt like I wasted money on this book.	2000-10-25

After being floored by Reality Dysfunction, and entertained by Neutronium Alchemist, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this final book (through the delay).  How disappointing it is, as the story seems to fall apart.  Perhaps it's the slash-and-burn style, and some difficulty in maintaining interesting characters throughout.  I don't know.  All I do know is that I had to nearly force myself to pick it up and finish it.	2000-10-25

I am not a fan of everything that Hamilton does, but this short story collection, which I picked up while awaiting the Naked God, was outstanding.  If I could give it more than five stars, I would.  The first story in particular was riveting.	2000-10-25

I am even more troubled by the &quot;namby pamby&quot; approach--they are little boys, not little girls, after all.	2000-10-25

I did take the time to finish this one, which says something for it.  But it is not nearly the book that Wilson's Darwinia is, and I was disappointed on that score.	2000-10-25

I found the medicine ball portion particularly helpful.  Very good pictures.	2000-10-25

Certainly, you would need both to have a complete library, because there are a lot of words that are not common to both, but this is the one to get if you can't have both.	2000-10-25

I admit that space opera is my favorite sub-genre, but I also enjoy the occasional &quot;little&quot; book, and really looked forward to reading this one.	2000-10-25

The book should focus more on the opportunities the giftedness creates for the child both in education and in living a richer life.  Developing the &quot;hungry mind&quot; is key, and not letting the child's curiosity be stifled by a lowest-common-denominator public schooling system.  A much better book was &quot;Bringing Out the Best:  A Resource Guide for Parents of Young Gifted Children.&quot;	2000-10-25

The many opinions in the book from before WWII are humorous if you understand the context, but this is a very spotty treatment of the subject.  And, no, I'm not planning my own book.	2000-10-25

This book and its predecessor, Raising a Thinking Child, should be used as textbooks for the parenting class everyone in America should be required to take before being allowed to have children.	2000-10-25

There are so many cliche phrases that we learn from our parents, TV, etc. that are very destructive, and certainly not constructive, and this book teaches parents how to talk to their children to foster many positive traits, including the &quot;hungry mind&quot; attitude.	2000-10-25

Recognizes giftedness as an opportunity for success academically as well as an opportunity to live a rich life, and offers practical, real-world advice about how to nurture and feed the &quot;hungry mind&quot; personality.	2000-10-25

Okay, maybe this is a slight overstatement--I liked Spence on Silkwood, but the rest are lackluster.  The title should be, &quot;A few ponderous closing arguments given in high-profile cases.&quot;	2000-10-25

This was an excellent and surprising book for me.  I'm looking forward to  his next offering, and to re-reading Darwinia in the future.	2000-08-25
