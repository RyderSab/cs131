The paper is opaque.  On all four sides of the double column page there are one inch margins for notes.  This is very nice.  There are center column references and an unusually large concordance.  I don't think there is a better cloth bound Bible on the market in terms of production quality. <br /> <br />The print is on the small side - 8 points, though it is a clear typeface.  My bifocals are up to the job. <br /> <br />The description of the product says \\"imitation\\" leather but the binding is cloth.  The cloth binding is black and seems very strong and durable.  I'm not disappointed.  There are few things stronger and more lasting than a tough hard cloth binding. <br /> <br />The Bible does not have notes (other than translation notes) though there are sub-headings above some paragraphs.  The sub-headings are useful. <br /> <br />This is a Bible for someone who wants strong cross-references, a good concordance and the Bible-alone in one package.  There are no notes (as in the NIV Study Bible) clarifying (or obscuring) doctrinal points and for many people this basic approach to Bible publishing will be preferable. <br /> <br />The price on Amazon (I paid less than $20.00) is a real bargin for a hard bound book of this quality, let alone a Bible.	2005-01-07

Best Christian book I've read this year, aside from the Bible.  We are thinking of using it in a Bible Study we lead. <br /> <br />The author has a wonderfully clear, engaging style.

It takes the  approach of diving into long program listings.  The coverage of Java  classes is about what you'd get by using the SUN online documentation  (which is better).<br />So I wouldn't use the book to teach yourself Java or  as a Java reference.<br />Here is where the book shines: setting up Java on  LINUX and using the large number of tools that are available on LINUX for  Java programming.<br />The book takes the approach of running programs and  showing their output almost without commentary, but it is the only book I  know of that will show you what is out there on LINUX if you want to do  Java development.	2000-01-07

There are beautiful dialogs concerning  the most profound questions anyone can ask.<br />An advantage of this  particular book is that for a reasonable price you can own Plato's complete  works in modern scholarly translations.  The volume is skillfully edited  and there are handy notes.<br />Plato is one of the few philosophers who can  be read for pleasure.  His influence on Western thought is immense.  As  Whitehead says, subsequent Western philosophy is just footnotes to  Plato.<br />Here are some of the works collected in this volume -<br />Apology -  Socrates defense of his life<br />Phaedo - a defense of the immortality of the  soul<br />Euthyrpo - a criticism of the Divine Command theory of  ethics<br />Republic - the ideal commonwealth, what is justice, theory of  ideas<br />Meno - the recollection theory of knowledge<br />Timaeus - Plato's  story of the creation of the universe, his cosmology	1999-12-31

He knows how to write action stories that are also very thought-provoking.  Shatner's name on a book means that you are going to have a quality read.<br />Avenger is one of his  best, thoroughly enjoyable.  It is the end of the Trilogy that began with  Return.  It also preceeds the new series that begins with Spectre.<br />Kirk,  Spock, and Picard must solve the problem of the virogen plauge that is  wrecking the Federation.  Loose ends from previous Star Trek novels and  movies are tied up.<br />The book leaves one with a lot to think about with  regard to ecology and eco-terrorism.  The Federation by homogenizing  environments puts the galaxy in danger of being overcome by disease.<br />The  story is also very moving and has a surprise ending I will not reveal.	1999-12-31

His history of  Greece, Rome, Israel and the Germans cannot be taken seriously anymore.  There are racist and jingoist views in this book that seriously date  it.<br />On the other hand, the book clearly expresses Hegel's spiritual  philosophy of an evolving God who learns from the history of the world that  is his thought.<br />For those who are looking for an introduction to Hegel  that is written in his own words, this book is invaluable.	1999-12-31

After reading this book, I was able to read more advanced  articles in the database literature.<br />The discussion in the book is  extremely clear.  The content is fascinating and it gives you a solid  introduction to topics that are basic to modern computer systems.<br />The  book will not make you an expert (you have to have suitable mentors and  suitable reading of the literature for that) but it will get you off the  ground which is all you should expect from an introductory book.<br />You have  to recognize that the code and algorithms are not industry quality - they  are teaching quality - they do not have all the optimizations one would  expect to use in industry;  the code in the book is designed to make the  concepts clear.	1999-12-24

Guide)	Books	5	21	21	N	N	Excellent self-contained introduction to LINUX and C++	This book comes with the LINUX operating system and a full program development environment on CD.<br />The book does not require any previous knowledge of C++ or LINUX or UNIX or the GNU tools.  All commands are  carefully explained.  It even explains how to use a Zip drive with LINUX.   It even explains how to work around certain bugs in gdb.<br />The book uses  the step-by-step approach, with fully worked exercises in the text.  All  the code in the text comes on CD ROM.  At each point in the learning  process, the reader produces working code.<br />There are helpful notes and  warnings that are highlighted to emphasize their importance.<br />It is both a  tutorial and a reference, 800 pages of solid information.  A full reference  on every aspect of C++ on LINUX would take thousands of pages, and the book  refers to the on-line LINUX documentation for topics (such as calloc) it  does not cover in depth.  The choice of the topics covered seems excellent.   One will be quite competent in C++ if one works one's way to the end of  the book.<br />The one thing I find questionable is the author's choice to  teach Xlib and V rather than the more popular GTK.  On the other hand,  covering GTK requires its own book, and an introductory book has to draw  the line somewhere at what it teaches.<br />I should also point out that there  are lots of programming languages one can use on LINUX besides C++, for  example, Perl, Java, Python, and Tcl/Tk.  I don't mean this as a criticism  of the book but if you want to start LINUX programming and you are new to  programming one of these languages might be a better place to start since  they are easier to learn than C++.<br />As an ad says in the back of the book,  Welcome to the Revolution.<br />Que classifies the knowledge level as  Intermediate .  This is fair.  While the book is self-contained, some  knowlege of how to program and &quot;computer maturity&quot; will be very  helpful.	1999-12-19
