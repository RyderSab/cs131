While I had used iTunes before getting this iPod, I found this book useful and very readable to discover how to use my iPod for more than playing tunes. I appreciate all the shareware and freeware mentioned in the book is on the book publisher's website. Most are fairly small downloads that won't take too long even on a dial-up connection.<br /><br />  Yes, the information is dated as this book gets to be a year old now, but still it is a useful reference book and hopefully a newer edition will be out later this year. I found many websites to supplement I do admit I just borrowed this book from the library, so my expectations are lower than someone who forked out money to get it.  I picked up Guy Hart-Davis's \\"How to Do Everything With Your iPod & Ipod mini second edition\\"  and while it does cover some things the missing manual doesn't, it is less readable and even more out of date, not to mention a condescending lecture on stealing music.  So look through this book and consider waiting for a new edition and/or try out some online resources.	2005-01-11

The dialogue is frequently bad as well. Brown frequently adds clunky foreshadowing in some chapters, in case the reader is incapable of remembering and or connecting the plot as it crashes along. Many of the cheap surprises in the plot come from the fact that the novel is told from the point of view of the main character Robert Langdon and so when he or his sidekick start to make connections, you as the reader are lead to believe that it must be true.  So when some of those assumptions are corrected in the ending, it causes problems at least for me.  The fact that Langdon and Vetra will hook up isn't surprising either, what is this a James Bond movie? Yes, this is a page turner/ thriller, but it's better done by other writers, such as Thomas Harris. At this point it will be awhile before I read another Dan Brown book, I'm glad I borrowed my copy of Angels & Demons.	2005-01-05

It started out a little slow, perhaps because it's been a few months since I've read a critical text, but then it became very readable. I was using this book to prepare for a prose poem panel discussion at a writing conference and found it extremely useful.  It seems like the prose poem is finally well on its way to becoming a more accepted form.  Recent collections such as Tony Tost's \\"The Invisible Bride\\" and Mary Koncel's \\"You Can Tell The Horse Anything\\" further this point. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested on prose poems, but don't expect an easy definition.	2004-11-29

I have to agree with one of the earlier reviews, Brooks  interweave multiple plot lines, creating somewhat shallow characters, something that is more frequent in the High Druid Series. I think Tanequil is better then Jarka Russ,  I read it in just a week's time because the plots are building well and finally gets together, leaving readers ready for the last novel in the series. The related Triology,  The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara,  had enough going on in each book and just enough characters, something is not as present in this series. I still would prefer less chracters in favor of more developed characters though, and in this volume too, many main characters perish, which perversely makes it easier to keep track of the rest. I will get the next book when it comes out, but I start to wonder if  this triology is the way Brooks is going to write from now on.	2004-11-13

However, McGrath's \\"Florida Poems\\" is an exception. Perhaps it is because Florida is a state that most Americans visit at some point, even if it is just to visit Disney, McGrath doesn't just show the beautiful side of the state or only the ugly side of it either, but a beautiful coherent combination of both. Not only is the colonization of Florida explored, occasionally lamented, but readers step inside Chucky Cheese's and the geography of Florida itself.  While there are two long poems in this collection, they are well worth reading, and especially the first one, \\"A City in Clouds\\" provides, if not retells, a myth of Florida. I especially enjoyed \\"William Bartram Beset by Crocodiles,\\" \\"Hemingway Dines on Boiled Shrimp and Beer,\\" and \\"Trouble With Miami.\\" I previously read \\"Road Atlas\\" just before this collection, which is another book I would highly recommend. So even if you never set foot in Florida itself, \\"Florida Poems\\" is an excellent way to visit Florida from the bookshelf.	2004-11-11

The narrative itself reads extremely well, I finished this book in just a few days, yet I remember much of the details, particularly the botflies, which make me shudder to even read about. I agree with other reviewers who recommend it to adventure readers as well as history fans. 'Skeletons On The Zahara&quot; by Dean King is also another worthwhile read, though I prefer Balf's less intrusive background information.	2004-07-20

Much of the novel is a reaction to the previous novel and Rand barely appears. This is a cross road indeed, with little direction or choices made by anyone. So much of the novel seems like a diversion, with new minor chracters that seem very unrelated to the saga's plots. By the end of the novel so few things happen, they could be summed up in a short pargraph, which is disappointing in a novel of this length. I may or may not continue reading this series, but this is the last book in the series I will pay for. The page turning days in this series are long gone.	2004-06-24

The entire novel feels like a footnote in the long term plot, since very little changes by the end, which deflates any potential impact this novel could make. Like some of the other novels in this series it stands alone in a bad way, such as kidnapped chracters getting out of danger well before the end of the novel and as many other reviewers noted a potentally complicating character, Nicholas, is dispatched with relative ease by Richard.  I also was annoyed with Jennsen who seemed there only to include summary from previous novels that got to be repetative especially as it was repeated to members of the Naked Empire. Just once I'd like to see a novel in this series that didn't end with everything neatly tied up since it's supposed to be a series, after all. I plowed through this book quickly in about three days and like many of the last few books in the series I was glad that I checked it out of the library. Save your money.	2004-06-07

Some are self-standing like #28 \\"Snow Line\\" while others require some knowledge of the series characters Henry and Mr. Bones. Everything seems topical: relationships, politics, writers, and even the everyday. Berryman frequently inverts syntax for striking effects. Most of the dream songs make a strange statement and build off of it such as \\"Life, Friends, is boring. We must not say so.\\" (#14) or \\"Bats have no bankers and they do not drink.\\" (#63) I admire the scope of topics such as work, love, and writing that are still relevant today and the seemingly matter-of-fact way Berryman writes, which often produces hilarious results, such as the case of the two previously mentioned poems. In one of the later songs he even takes on himself  \\"The only happy people in the world/ are those who do not have  to write long poems.\\" (#354) The Dream Songs are crucial for anyone interested in 20th and even Contemporary Literature.	2004-04-14

While initially I read the essays in this collection as sources for a paper on Williams, I found it extremely useful to my own writing to read his thoughts about poetry and discussing his ability to briefly focus on his surroundings in so many of his poems that result in powerful and deeply felt poems. In one essay, \\"On `From My Window' \\" Williams discusses the actual events that inspired the poem, mentioning,  \\"much of our moral education consists in.... apparently minor, oblique encounters.\\"	2004-04-14

As the title suggests, stories are a central theme in this collection. Katz is especially skilled at taking a fresh approach to historical places, figures, and events. One especially memorable poem, \\"A Nation So Ignorant of Itself\\" deals with John Wesley Powell exploring the Grand Canyon, the experience itself and afterwards how terrible it must be to discuss what he has seen with others, that they can never see or understand. Other poems are incredibly location based, like \\"In the Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague\\" which focuses on a crowded cemetery where tombstones are placed on top of each other and look \\"like molars in a small jaw.\\"	2004-04-13

None of these are new to poetry and are often overdone. Yet Marvin's poems are different and the strong, clear emotions are part of a strange enjoyment of them. The first poem \\"Reader, Please\\" is not a typical welcome to a collection, but a door slammed in the face, the \\"please\\" saying I don't need or want sympathy. A lot of contemporary poetry steers away from unpleasant emotion while Marvin wraps both hands around them and dares us to read about it. Other favorite poems include \\"Why Sleep,\\" \\"Landscape Without You,\\" \\"Please,\\" \\"The Articulate,\\" and \\"The Readership\\" with great play on the ship in readership. I also suspect some influence of Berryman in her poem, \\"The Condition\\" which begins \\"what we share most is boredom, friend.\\"	2004-04-13

Flannery's introduction for each provides an excellent, concise biography and set up to each explorer's excerpt. In many of the excerpts, an explorer faces death and disaster. The most intriguing initially was Charles Sturt writing of his attempt to find the mythical lake in the center of Australia. He brings a boat, experiences weather so hot it bursts a thermometer his party carries, they suffer from extreme scurvy, and Sturt's desire to be the first to reach the center of Australia.  The second explorer I read in this collection was Ernest Giles. His except focuses on an expedition with his assistant Gibson, who goes for help and manages to get lost, and then Giles slowly makes his way back to base camp. Reading The Explorers fascinated me enough that I wanted to read more about specific explorers like Giles, but also about Australian explorers in general.	2004-04-13

Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for \\"Moby-Dick\\" or \\"Bartleby the Scrivner\\" for a real sense of Melville's writing.	2004-03-14

Poem after poem seems caught up in self-aware, self-indulgent &quot;look at me I'm a poet!&quot; and ideas never taken to their full extent. None of these poems are overly memorable. Some seem just shallow attempts to offend as many people as possible, recycling themes that have been used over and over again, but often done better by other poets. Perhaps he is an excellent reader in person, but the poems should have some power when read on their own, which these fail to do.	2004-01-28

Besides being a bit short for a novel, The Last Days of Publishing seems to be missing so many things that could have made for an interesting and readable novel. I have to agree with one of the other reviews, few of the characters are well developed and they seem to come and go, often with minimal explanation. The plot is also weak and presented in out of chronological order, which makes for anticlimactic reading. Much of the information about publishing could easily be gleaned in various magazines and better written books, such as Betsy Lerner's &quot;The Forest for the Trees&quot; as well as the nostalgia for the 60's, like many of Tim O'Brien's novels, especially &quot;July, July&quot; (which isn't even his best novel).  Aside from a clever cover, I can't recommend this book.	2004-01-09

There were numerous questions about literary critics and their books not mentioned even in passing in this book. Many of the older writers are barely on the test, like Chaucer. Urging students to review their Norton is a helpful suggestion and the practice test along with the one supplied by the GRE is also some help in getting ready.

As much as I think Terry Brooks is one of the better Fantasy writers, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that character development is lacking in Jarka Ruus. Even though this is the first book of a trilogy, there is still more than enough room in a roughly 400 page book to do more.  Other than Grianna and Pen, it is difficult to know which of the other characters are going to be around for very long, but even in  a stand alone novel, all characters that are important should be developed.  I wish Jarka Ruus had either fewer characters or about 100 pages more to show each character's traits instead of just telling us various chunks of information.<br />  I will read the next book and the one after in the series, but I hope Shannara doesn't get lost to another overly formulaic pattern, like too many other fantasy series.	2003-11-28

I first came across Mark Turpin when his poem &quot;Waiting For Lumber&quot; appeared on the Poetry Daily website. I was immediately struck by the unusual subject matter and the simple, yet powerful truth quickly captivated me. Again and again we are taken into a world of 2x4's, bent nails, and sawdust, portrayed in a realistic and beautiful way.  We feel the monotony of banging nails all day without it becoming tedious or boring to read. Turpin takes us into the lives and minds of builders through himself and his coworkers.

The simple, yet long sentences do require some adjustment and it can be frustrating to go through the Spanish dialogue, though usually enough clues are given to let readers figure out what is going on. McCarthy's use of dialogue is brilliant, especially his use of dialect and realistic conversations. I really wanted to know what would happen to Grady and Rawlins to the very end. Page turners are a rare occurence in contemporary novels.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, I couldn't understand why Grady would risk his freedom to go get his horse.  For a few pages it seemed like he was going to repeat the fatal mistake of Blevins. All it all, &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; is an excellent novel, well worth picking up and enjoying McCarthy's writing that often nears poetic, especially in his description of horses, which he seems have have an innate understanding of.	2003-08-28

Characters come and go and the main character Hildy often does things, such as change sexes, that only seem like gimmicks. Many times he skips around to an overindulgent and annoying extent. I didn't find him overly sympathetic or interesting. However, It is interesting to think that people and even a supercomputer could become depressed as life becomes too easy as everything is taken care of down to morning breath.  This is the only Varley book I've read to date. I get the sense from the way many chapters read like episodes, he may be a better short story writer.	2003-08-19

Especially interesting to me are the sections on Australian Explorers and how their hardships, especially failures, have been transformed into myths.  As an American who spent a semester in Australia, taking an Australian Studies course, I found this book supported what I had learned, while futhering my interests.

I've been reading Jordan like a madman this year to catch up to his tenth book. This is the third book in the series I've finished this year. Things finally start to move in the second half of the book and it finishes with a major  series altering development. Jordan sometimes seems to have created too many characters and subplots for anyone, including himself, to keep track of. &quot;Heart of Winter&quot; starts with Perrin and his party, but gives way to Matt and Rand, leaving you to wonder about Perrin after his temporary disappearance. I suppose this keeps you waiting to see what happens to him and his wife, but it can get frustrating not to get a clue as you finish the book.

I don't think you need a new edition every year, especially when you start marking in a version, crossing out places that aren't your thing and underlining important details, like reading periods and how many poems each place wants at a time. Even with this book, it doesn't hurt to visit each publication's website in case information has changed since this book was published. I almost wish they would put in boldface several important aspects, such as reading dates, number of poems desired at a time, and if they take simultaneous submissions or not. While the last is a huge and hotly debated topic, you can at least decide if you want to stick with places that accept it and/or if you want to not mention in your cover letter that you are sending poems elsewhere. (Who wants to wait nine months for a rejection slip?) I also appreciate the sample poems many places offer up since a few with lower quality poems may be avoided.

I was stuck halfway through &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot;, putting it down and finally getting back to it after years and picking up the later books as they came out. So now I can read them back to back, which helps since &quot;Crown&quot; and &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot; have minimal gaps between the two. One thing about such long series is that the author creates such brilliant complicated worlds and characters. It does get old when chararcters keep repeating how much they want to beat sense into each other and the same arguements come back. I like Matt and trust he will return in the next book. The movements in this series seem to be like a chessboard with new pieces added and others subtracted almost at random. I do admit to have some of the &quot;series guilt&quot; that other reviewers have, where you have invested so much time and yes money into reading the previous novels, that to give up after reading 8 hefty books seems to mean wimping out. I hope I can keep up, but after skimming the one and two star  reviews for &quot;Crossroads&quot; it may be as much a test to keep reading as it is for Rand to stay sane.	2003-05-31

It doesn't slow down like &quot;Rise to Rebellion&quot; . He is slowly getting away from the temptation to tell instead of show, but it still happens at times. This book easily could have been two novels, which would have given more space to describe more of the Revolution in detail. A few small chapters seem inserted just to name drop historical figures like John Paul Jones soley to say it covers all the important figures There are so few novels about this important war, that Shaara should get some credit for raising attention and interest in it. However, I still am skeptical that he will ever reach the level of his father's &quot;The Killer Angel&quot;.

Williams poetry often mimics the thought process, reasoning its way to significance. In his early poems, sections or stanzas divide this process. Later, as he develops his writing, the lines grow. The amount of thought and details expand As Sherod Santos describes in his essay  A Solving Emptiness, \\"The breathless insistence of Williams's line give ordinary moments a stupefying psychological power, an Orphic music. With a microscopic eye that notch by notch closes in on its subjects,  Williams's microscopic eye allows us to experience his experiences almost as if they are our own. His poems have a strong sense of place, with large amounts of description and images to further this effect.  My favorite poem is \\"Tar\\", but I enjoy many of his other poems such as \\"A Day for Anne Frank\\",  \\"The Beginning of April\\", \\"The Sanctity.\\"  C.K. Williams is a poet that should not be overlooked by anyone interested in great poetry.	2003-04-30

Yet he is a writer whose not his best is still quite good. It is quite readible and  full of wonderfull insights and phrases. One example is &quot;We won't understand a thing about humaon life if we persist in avoiding the most obvious fact: that a reality no longer is what it was when it was; it cannot be reconstructed.&quot;  In other words, you can't ever truly go home.<br />I especially enjoyed his comparison between Odysseus and the two Czech characters returning to their country. It's hard to not wonder if this also pertains to Kundura, since he still lives in France even after the fall of communism in the Czech Republic.  It is a cerebral, but not an overly taxing read.	2003-01-13

It serves as a good way of learning more about him. Not only is much of the writing funny, it is insightful as well. While I'm glad to read his \\"last novel\\" it is far from complete. It's very disconcerting to get into this episode of Dirk Gently and suddenly for a few chapters the point of view abrutly shifts to the first person and then goes back to a few more chapters and suddenly stops. The editor does warn you about this and if you are a die hard fan then you will want to pick up this book. It's worth a look by everyone else as well, for the random essays on making a good cup of tea, to why he loved Bach.	2002-12-18

It takes a long time to take off, but once it does, it's fairly interesting. I don't mind learning a little about where some of the B-24 airmen came from and the training they went through, but Ambrose throws a long list of airmen, that other than McGovern and his crew you almost never see again. I agree with other reviewers, his other books are much better. I think it would have been more interesting to go into more detail with just McGovern and his crew and avoid some of the other things that slow this book down.	2002-12-02

It is hard to compare them with each other, because each has a different focus and they travel by different means. Horwitz has quite a deal of humor, though not quite as much as Bryson. This book is similar to \\"Cold Beer and Crocodiles\\", since Horwitz also spent many nights out in the bush. Probably the best part of \\"One For the Road\\" is the variety of Australians he meets, either as they give him a lift or as he wanders around each new location. He is very eager to get to know people in the various regions of New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, South Australia, and West Australia. This book is not quite the laugh out loud as his \\"Confederates in the Attic\\", but it has its moments, especially when he grows weary of the laid back, no worries, attitude of Australians, which is, from personal experience frustrating to americans, who are used to everything happening on time and in some kind of predictable order (usually)<br /> It would be easy to infer, that drinking is big in Australia, especially the way in some parts, Hortwitz is given distance between places, based on how many beers a driver would put away before reaching the next pub. It's hilarious since I can't think of too many other places that do this, but it is serious too. He doesn't really get into the number of accidents and so on from all these drunk people, but it isn't too hard to drive, when many Australian roads are straight for hundreds of miles. Still, I would recommend \\"One for the Road\\"; to anyone interested in Australia or  likes a good travel narrative.	2002-09-14

I read the Killer Angels when iIwas in about eight grade, which has been a few years. I just saw the movie version again a few weeks before reading this novel.<br />  Its not an exhaustive account of the time period it covers, Shaara chooses the main characters of the Killer Angels and adds others like Jackson that are an important part of the novel. Shaara does skip some events or just explains them in a few paragraphs like Jackon's Valley Campaign.  Its a good novel to introduce someone to some important people of the Civil War, especialy showing that they are human beings of varying degrees.  I'm no historian, but I think the depictions of Lee,  Jackson, Longstreet, etc. are generally acurate and if anything reading  Gods and Generals should provide an interest to find out more about these fascinating people.	2002-08-26

Part of my problem stems from not going to college in the 80's. Still, I remember hearing about people that got so far into Dungeons and Dragons they crawled through air ducts in their dorms. Not all things have changed so radically. I went to school with plenty of airheads, computer geeks, and obnoxious people on a four-year party vacation. I can relate to going into various offices on campus, like financial aid and get the run around or being treated like a file in a drawer of thousands. So its not difficult for me to appreciate the parodies and satire of college life. It's the second half of the novel, which gets away from me like a huge stone on a hillside. Granted The Big U is not a novel to be taken literally, but the all out war that occurs at the end of the novel. This conflict overwhelms the entire ending with a gaping hole in the ground, instead of a more developed finale with the characters changing in a significant way. If you want to read a better novel similar to this one, then I recommend Jane Smiley's Moo. As for Stephenson, Snow Crash is his best novel.	2002-08-07

My opinion of the book plummets with each page, as  I like the main characters less and less. There are some beautifully written segments, but there are too many problems overall.  The setting is of very little importance, it could be nearly anywhere in Eastern Europe in 1990. One by one the main characters are discarded until the last one is tossed off the pages.  Some of the character's are briefly interesting, like John, while others, like Scott never make it even that far.  I don't think i would recommend this book to anyone.	2002-07-30

Molloy's book and Albrights'  Hiking Great Smoky Mountains. I tried to use both of them, but time and time again I returned to Molloy. His guide is concise and you can quickly find what you're looking for without reading ten to twenty pages. His rating system, distance, and time charts are extremely valuable. His time estimates are a bit on the faster than average side, but you should allow extra time anytime you go hiking. Keep in mind too that most of the trails in the park involve going up and down hills as trails take you up to crests and ridges. Mainy of these trails would be hard to find on your own, with an overwhelming amount to choose from. I did trails in Tennessee including Injun Creek, Mount Cammerer, Sutton Ridge Overlook, and Walker Sisters Place. I would recommend doing a three or four hour hike before jumping to the six hour hikes. I think the only bad think about this book is after doing most of the hikes, you wish he would mention more.<br />  As for the other reviews, Molloy spends a little time on suggesting you take rain gear, plenty of water/ water treatment tablets/filters. You don't need too much gear to just go hiking, but you should be prepared for nearly anything. I would say this book is geared to someone that has been hiking, backpacking before, but there is no reason  a beginner couldn't benefit from using Molloy's guidebook. You can always ask a park ranger where to find various wildlife, but spend any amount of time on the trail, especially quietly, you're bound to run into some of the diverse wildlife found in the Great Smoky Mountains.	2002-05-20

I'm not especially interested in any of these characters and I feel like I'm being beaten over the head by Goodkind to understand  their conflicting feelings  especially, Jennsen's. The ending sews nearly everything too neatly, something Goodkind does, as if its an hour long TV episode. If nothing else, \\"The Pillars of Creation\\" provides an in depth look at the spin Emperor Jagang wants to put on reality and how poorly it holds up under  close observation. It's a quick read and diversion, not  a thought provoking novel to struggle through.	2002-05-20

I bought two books for my trip to the Smokies. This book and Johnny Molloy's &quot;Day and Overnight Hikes in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park&quot; I tried to use both books, but I consistently returned to Molloys. The Albrights book would be all right to use if you wanted to sit down and read it from cover to cover, or at least a section of the park you want to explore. It is nearly impossible to flip through and find any specific trail. Beside this, their tone especially in the introduction put me off from this book. I think its designed to encourage anyone to try hiking, which is good, but for someone that has hiked for years, it treats me, the reader, as a simpleton, who has never stepped off the pavement in my life. This book is useful, but not as useful or concise as Molloy's guidebook.	2002-05-20

Other than a not short enough changeover in Heathrow, I have not yet been to England. However, I've met several British tourists abroad, as well as other travelers who have been to the U.K. So I thought I had enough knowledge to tackle this book, though honestly, you don't need a cup of tea to go through \\"Notes\\". Bryson rushes you along on a whirl of words, generally with enough humor, insight, and true experiences to let you gladly follow him almost anywhere. One of my favorite scenes is late in the book where Bryson defends the US against two Whinging Pohms (to borrow a sometimes dead on phrase) Fortunately not everyone fits this stereotype. As with any personal travel narrative, some things are left out and this account focuses mainly on Britain with a small part of Scotland. Ireland isn't included at all. If you like Bryson's other books this won't disappoint. If you are looking for an amusing read, Notes from a Small Island is an excellent choice.	2002-03-06

When used with a regular guidebook, this helps you visualize the various sights of Prague, but it can overwhelm you with the sheer number of attractions. My biggestproblem with this guidebook series is the lack of opinions from the authors. One perk of Lonely Planet or similar guidebook is saying what is worth your time, this isn't worth your time. This museum has an English translation sheet.. this one doesn't.  I find this helpful in selecting how to use my travel time wisely. So i wouldn't actualy recommend buying this book, but if you see in your local library or book store, its worth flipping through to see what Prague is all about.	2002-02-26

Weis and Hickman move away from large chunks of detailed lectures about their new world and let the story take precedence, like its supposed to anyway. Unfortunately, they fall back to their old ways. Honestly, if I want to be told directly why one race hates another race or why one race wears pink instead of blue, I'll go to the gaming world guidebook. In a novel, just show me, I'll figure it out. With that out of the way, the second improvement is focusing away from the spoiled, obnoxious, I'm a bad guy because I wear black armor and you don't, Dagnarus , to the other side with actually capable heroes, something the first novel truly lacked.  Often in a trilogy, the plot just creeps along, just enough to set you up for the third concluding novel. Guardians of the Lost differs here, particularly with an ending to make you wait impatiently for the next novel to come out in a year. The tide shifts back from the first novel, suggesting a good final ending, but not necessarily. I think they have written better novels than this one, but `Guardians of the Lost' is a book in the right direction.	2001-12-27

I recognized Smith's name from `Poetry' so I went past the title of this collection to see if it would surpass my inhibitions. Based on the poems in this collection, I think he could write a wonderful poem about dirty laundry. I have to confess to reading more fiction than poetry on average, though I'm slowly correcting this.<br />  Favorite poems in here- Beautyworks- curls to recapitulation, Beds- a list poem, but an excellent ode to beds, and As For Trees, variation on a list of trees. Reading through the collection again, I could select so many as favorites.<br />  Many times when I read a poetry collection, I will flip through and read a few random poems, but Smith's collection is so readable and his voice so strong like in Fistfight, each poem is worth your attention. Almost a stream (of consciousness) that flows so well, I would follow it over a waterfall, if he kept writing. They move like Of This I Speak to No One, drawing you in close, putting an arm around your shoulder telling you something in an intimate, confessional manner.<br />  This is easily one of my favorite books of poetry in the past year.

More than anything at that point, it is only science fiction because of the 70's porno amount of sex Kidd engages in. I didn't feel any closer to understanding him, (its annoying to have a &quot;nameless&quot; character for too long, even if great writer's like Kafka did it) or much of the novel. Its a subtle science fiction, no spaces ships or laser guns. Even as frustrating as the first half was for me, I do hope to go back and try to finish it, because so many other reviewers got something out of it but I had to pull myself to a less tedious book for now. I liked Delany's juxtaposition of third person with first person stream of consciousness, it worked well even if it is underused.	2001-08-29

So I can only attest to the Czech republic portion of this book. I found it extremely useful, especially in planning my trips outside of Prague, though it does contain a good portion about Prague. One of the best suggestions was to include a visit to Litomerice after the somber tour of Terezin. I didn't take the advice on booking ahead on my trip to Cesky Krumlov and spent about an hour finding a place to stay and I went late May.  Not speaking any Czech beyond hello and thank you, I had a lot of trouble with the  Czech train system, especially outside of Prague. I found the bus system to be better than the Czech train system since you could buy a ticket on the bus as you boarded and the bus drivers were friendlier to me than the ladies at the ticket windows at the Main Train station in Prague and in Cesky Budjovice (where my train to Cesky Krumlov was early and I didn't understand when it showed up, so I took a bus instead) Either way, it is extremely inexpensive to travel around the country, so at the very least take a few day trips outside of Prague, if not longer trips. I was lucky this new edition came out months before my trip.  Another great guidebook by Lonely Planet. As for an earlier review, Prague Castle counts as a museum, so its closed on Mondays.	2001-08-06

However, I found it extremely useful to have on hand from consulting the Metro map to small area maps. They can't replace having a good map of Prague, but they can help you find and identify sights in an area and nearby restaurants. Complete pronunciation would make the small Czech language guide in the back more useful since Czech is not a language you just start speaking. I don't understand why Lonely Planet no longer makes their cities guides in a pocket friendly size. I loved being able to cram the Melbourne guide in my pocket when I wandered around there.  It is debatable on just getting the entire Czech and Slovak Republic guide instead of just the Prague guide, since there is a large amount of overlap. If you're just visiting Prague, I would recommend getting this small volume, but for more widespread travel in the Czech Republic, the complete volume is your choice. I took both, and probably could have done without this city guide, but didn't want to take any chances on missing out on anything in Prague, even though Prague has more than enough to offer for several visits.  Included are several day trips outside of Prague, such as to Terezin, a nearby concentration camp and site of a clever ruse. Worth half a day visit, though fairly depressing. If you're going to spend more than a few days in Prague, this is essential. For just a weekend you will still get some use out of it, though it might overwhelm you with all the places to visit in Prague.	2001-08-06

Vlk does use a lot of humor which makes studying less painfull, but unfortunately it doesn't make up for the rest of the book. I used this book faithfully several months before taking the GRE and in the end did poorly. She encourages you to rush through the test, guessing if you can't come up with the answer in a short amount of time. Its much better to keep your eye on the clock as you go through the test and try to use all the time they give you, since if you finish early you can't go back. Since the GRE is only given on a computer now, doesn't it make more sense to study it on a computer? Her roots, prefixes, and suffixes is a good idea, but you need to couple it with learning the kind of words on the GRE, especially when knowing what just part of the word means isn't helpfull. I had much better results studying with a computer program, in my case the Princeton Review.	2001-05-02

Roff first covered his trip around Australia in a three part series in National Geographic a few years ago. It was a find to discover he had written an entire book on his journey since cycling around a country roughly the size of the United States should produce more material than just three magazine articles. It's not quite the same prose either, so if you did read these articles, you're not reading a reprint.<br />\\"Cold Beer and Crocodiles\\" is a poor title, especially when Smith's account proves there is so much more to Australia than the two.  He does an excellent job of describing the different climates he rides and lives through.<br />Just as skillful is his portrayal of the various Australians he meets along the way. I spent several months in the country a few years ago, so I can relate to their overwhelming hospitality and generosity (most). As few truly unfriendly and hostile Australians as I met, I'm glad Smith wasn't afraid to mention the few he came across.  They're such a small minority, especially if you consider a similar trip made around say the US. A small number would be so open to a strange cycling by their homes. Traditionally, Australians are used to strangers traveling through covering the vast distances in search of work. Even so I think Smith fortunate to get a rare glimpse (for the rest of the world anyway) into an outback station, several, and we're lucky to read about his other experiences.  His balance between the positive and negative provides a wonderful narrative of his trip. I agree with other reviewers the book winds up extremely quickly, and he skips through and by several places worth commenting on. He barely writes about this trip in Tasmania. But this isn't the Rough Guide to Australia. What is mentioned and left out is entirely up to the writer. There are several other books on travel in Australia, such as Bryson's \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" to give a different spin on Oz.	2001-04-23

I've been reading Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman since the Dragonlance Chronicles, one of the first fantasy series I ever read. I've read most of their Dragonlance novels and their Deathgate Cycle as well.  Like the main character, in the Deathgate Cycle, Haplo,  \\"Well of Darkness\\" devotes the majority of time to the villains, who slowly gain power and momentum in the course of the novel. Like the brothers Majere of Dragonlance, there is a conflict between good and bad, between the two brothers Gareth and Helmos. There conflict is much more pronounced, eventually leading to a war.  It isn't completely new to follow the \\"bad guys\\", but it is refreshing after so many fantasy novels that insist on following the heroes, who too often just walk over villains while barely breaking a sweat.  Since \\"Well of Darkness\\" is taking place in a new realm, it spends much of the first part of the novel, introducing and explaining it. This slows the pace, but it is better to take the time to explain things instead of simply flying by them and hope the reader will figure it out or dismiss nearly as quickly as the writer.  All in all, \\"Well of Darkness\\" is not Weis and Hickman's best work.  Many of the main characters don't make it out of the novel. Considering this is going to be a trilogy, some new characters will have to emerge, or the remaining characters, will have to develop and take more of a role. I know I'm heavily biased in favor of the Dragonlance, but I loved their Deathgate Cycle series. Perhaps, \\"Well of Darkness\\" will improve as the of series comes out, but it lacks what so many of their other better novels contain.	2001-03-10

Another novel just to cover a solid 100 pages of plot wasn't needed, but &quot;Shards of a Broken Crown&quot; arose for just such a  purpose. Fragments of the enemy army are on the Western coast. Kesh decides now would be a good time to get a chunk of Midkemia. Feist also unravels what had been tied up earlier. The need to turn more tricks and bump off more characters comes up. Many of these tricks are built up quickly to be deflated with the wave of a main characters sword. Yawn. How can a foe be so powerful and terrible, if the main characters can defeat them so easily?  In earlier Feist novels rarely did a main character die, but when he or she did it had significance and other main characters were affected for a long time. Yet in &quot;Shards&quot; a few more somewhat main characters are disposed of, as if it were time to take out the trash before the series ends. Their deaths are often brushed away which cheapens and lessens any effect their deaths might have. While yes people do die in warfare, it could be done better.  A highly faulty character, Patrick, is new for this series as well. It's slightly strange he suddenly appears in this novel as if they let him out of the dungeon moments before you open the book cover. Despite his flatness, he foreshadows some interesting possibilities for future novels after pissing off the original main character, Pug. (No one told him what a dumb idea this is)  Overall &quot;Shards&quot; felt like a leftover, as if the series was promised to be so long and enough extra material was thrown in for one final novel in this uneven saga. I can only hope his newer series is better than this.	2000-10-31

It reads well though not as well as  'Eucalyptus'. From my own limited experience in traveling, 'Homesickness' does an excellent job of capturing the stereotypical tourist comparing every country to their own, usually in a less than flattering manner, sending home postcards with generic statements, and trying to go native. The museums the characters of the novel visit are strange, bordering on plain weird. From the (literal) Institution of Marriage to a corrugated metal museum, Bail leads us through each one with subtle humor. His sketch of each destination is done well, especially New York City and Russia.  While this is an interesting novel, though the average reader might get lost by references to various aspects of Australia culture, I liked his more recent novel, 'Eucalyptus'. I think readers who travel a lot will find much of this novel amusing and dead on. A few of the sentence structures are strange such as missing commas or the syntax in unusual order that I had to reread a second time to understand. Just before Bail dumps the Australian tourists on their last trip to Russia, he provides his own experiences in Russia, which seemed like he wanted to include this extra material for the heck of it.	2000-10-17

It wasn't the sole story in the novel, but it was the main focus.  &quot;Rage&quot; is back on track with the overall conflict between Midkemia and the Emerald Emperess's Army advance. So much happens in fact, it made me wonder why another novel in the series is necessary. There are some ends left untied, but overall overthree quarters of the plot gets settled.  I'm glad to see the return of characters from previous novels and Feist isn't afraid to show the seriousness of the conflict in not all make it through this novel, which only makes sense. Boredom would set in if all the good characters made it through every conflict with only minor scratches.	2000-10-13

I liked &quot;Class Trip&quot; for  Nicholas's wonderful, if not morbid, imagination. I was slighty  disappointed in his lack of action but most of the story takes place in his  imagination anyway. He reminded me of the character Eugene in Wolfe's  &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot;  &quot;The Mustache&quot; is a Kafka-eske  novella, but not as much as the plug on the back of the book sets you up  for. It is bizzare none the less especially towards the odd ending where  the main character feels trapped in an existenstialist world. The shift is  a bit ackward and the whole idea of everyone forgotting you had once had a  mustache is a large stretch. I think it would be better if his wife and  friends forgot who he was/ didn't recognize him when he shaved off his  mustache. His paranoia is similar to Nicolas's but much worse.  I  recommend reading &quot;Class Trip&quot; but save your shaving cream for a  different mustache.	2000-09-05

Friedman's novels come out in a trickle but are always worth the  wait. Her worlds are well developed and constructed with enough detail to  convince readers of reality. Darkness is a main theme in her novels.  Evil  has seemingly vast resources and power compared to the good. Only at great  sacrifice does  the hero or heroine triumph.  For readers new to Friedman,  &quot;This Alien Shore&quot; is an excellent place to begin. Her Coldfire  trilogy is also worth reading especially for it's blend of science fiction  and fantasy.<br />&quot;This Alien Shore&quot; provides an interesting  glimpse into a possible future. While yes, science fiction is just that,  fiction. Yet considering the exponential rate technology is shrinking in  size while increasing in speed coupled with the increasing popularity of  the internet (outernet in this novel)  Friedman's novel may not be so far  off the mark. It could be a long time before understand the human brain  along time before we understand it enough to fuse a computer with but it  could happen some day. Viruses are more intelligent, capable of improving  their programming as they continue to fry computers. It is much worse to  have your computer crash when it is hardwired into your brain.<br />Many  people are quick to dismiss genre fiction as &quot;escapist  literature&quot; but writers like Friedman are too good to pass up for any  reason. You will miss a great deal if you brush her away.	2000-08-26

While this  book is geared towards writers it provides an excellent insight into the  life of an editor, various other positions in a publishing house, and  publishing life. I found this to be a great bonus that won't get in the way  of the main focus of the book.  Her advice incorporates her own  experience from starting out as an assitant editor and beyond with other  editors of famous writers for an excellent book about writing and  publishing. It is well written, easy to read, humorous and extremely  usefull. I am far from getting anything publishing, but I found it helpful  to get such an indepth look and I think nearly any avid reader who would  like to know more about the whole process would gain something while being  entertained at the same time. I definitely think it is a future source of  reference as I look to publish in the future.	2000-08-03

I do like pageturners as I call them, but not on a regular basis. However, I read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and I was extremely surprised by it and Harris. It made me want  to read &quot;Hannibal&quot; as soon as I could. Harris is such a writer if  ignored you would miss quite a lot. Hannibal Lector has to be one of the  most complicated characters ever created. Is he evil? Is he sort of good?  Is he in the middle? His attitude and interest in Starling seem to suggest  that he can't be labeled in black and white terms. He does have a vigilate  like presence in fighting the truly bad and corrupt characters that  &quot;hannibal&quot; further explores. Besides Mason as the clear bad guy  in the novel, other character's like the greedy Italian Police chief that  tries to arrest Hannibal for the reward, justice seems to be served in the  end.  Usually, the title character of a novel is the character the novel  revolves around.  It was confusing, yet suspenseful as you expected him to  appear at any moment. I like all the &quot;extras&quot; as some other  reviewers mention. Hannibal is certainly a very well educated character,  going against the typical (whatever that is) serial killer or however you  want to label him. He speaks Italian fluently. He is a good cook. (just  don't ask what (or who) you're eating) Flat characters are few in this  novel.  For readers wanting a novel like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;,  read &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;. For another well written and  interesting novel  read &quot;hannibal&quot;	2000-07-28

I was skeptical at first because I am primarily interested in his fiction dealing with the Vietnam War, but  this is a large part of &quot;In the Lake of the Woods&quot; Like some of  his other writing, O'brien circles around and around events and actions,  revealing more and more of what happened. I really liked the chapters of  quotations from characters as if questioned by police along with quotations  about John Wade and quotations relevant to the novel. O'Brien leaves it up  to the reader to decide if Wade really did make his wife disappear or not  with hypothetical chapters. It is a twist on on a mystery because it  doesn't tie up all the loose ends and right away it is implied no one may  ever really know the truth. I think this novel would make an excellent  novel to read and discuss as a group or in a class. There is just so much  to talk about. If you have never read anything by O'Brien this is a  wonderful place to start. If you have read anything else by him, this will  not disappoint.	2000-06-02

However, from the wonderful introduction Jorie Graham provided, I expected an equally wonderful collection in a call of arms for poets to  help poets realize what they do is equally valid as anything else a writer  may write, be it fiction or non-fiction. Unfortunately, I had trouble  finding even one poem that was more that just okay. Perhaps it should just  be called American poetry of 1990. I would recommend the 1999 edition of  this series over the 1990 edition.	2000-06-01

After reading the initial Chronicles triology they wrote, as well as Test of the Twins, the majority of the  other Dragonlane books are second rate, many to the point of being painful  to read.  Dragons of a Fallen Sun is an intertwining of old and new.  Caramon, Goldmoon, and several others make an appearance in the novel, some  more than others. Tasslehoff is a main character, a welcome return. I was  slightly annoyed initially to have so many &quot;old&quot; characters, but  its hard not to enjoy and laugh at Tasslehoff's antics. The comic relief he  supplies is often needed against the grim time and settings of the novel.  Overall, the new characters like Mina, stand well on their own. You may  disagree, but she is a very Christ like figure because of her healing  powers, devote followers, and preachings about the One True God. I think  she is not so simply labled though, but hopefully more will be revealed in  the rest of the series. A few characters I think are from previous novels I  didn't read, such as about the Chaos Wars, but there is enough background  provided that I didn't feel left out by not reading these and other novels.  In fact, this could be your first Dragonlance novel and you would not feel  left behind the rest of us.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone  familiar with Dragonlance, Weis and Hickman, as well as anyone looking for  an excellent fantasy novel.	2000-05-19

Within the first few pages, it becomes apparent quickly that Manhattan Transfer is not a traditional novel. Dos Passos presents a collage of New York City in the 1920's that even 75 years later describes well the modern  city. His technique of jumping from character to character as they interact  with each other within the city as some succeed and others fail provides a  bleak, yet at the same time oddly wonderful reading. His injection of  newspaper ads, songs, and advertisements captures so well the bustle of  large cities. I can only wonder why he is often left out of the  &quot;canon&quot; of American Modernists. It does take adjustment to read  Manhattan Transfer, but you will be more than rewarded for your efforts.	2000-05-14

It did take me awhile to get into this book, but reads more like a novel than a 'history book' and I mean this as a compliment. Gannon spent a lot of time researching every possible aspect. Not only giving the German U-boat side, he also gives the U.S. Navy and Royal Navy perspective as  well. This is important to realize how lax the American Navy was in the  Atlantic, almost completely ignoring the threat until several thousand tons  of shipping, boats, and lives were lost to U-boats. Cracking the Enigma  coat was an extremely important to the Allies defeat and sinking of many  U-boats. It is impossible to write an account of German U-Boats and not  mention it. The amount of detail Gannon provides is nothing short of  amazing.  Operation Drumbeat is an excellent account and look at one  U-boats patrols to the East Coast of North America, a nearly forgotten  event in history.	2000-05-02

If you took out all the sections about sex, there would be very little left. The  main character, is irritating at best. One of his girlfriends calls him  'mild', but this is too kind. He is very unconcerned about anything  signifigant. A few of his comments are almost funny, but often so  outlandish, I wondered how he he came up with any of them. McGahan creates  some interest  between what Gordon says, what he does, and the different  responses he gives to other characters depending on who they are. Think  unreliable narrator, if you will. I read this novel quickly, due more to  lack of anything to slow me down on or really have to ponder than interest  or readibility. It's like watching a TV movie, perhaps this is why it was  made into a movie. I expect to get something, anything from a novel, and  this novel failed to deliver. I continued to hope Gordon would do something  but he never does, happy to get his welfare checks and destroy himself and  anyone else that comes along for the ride.	2000-05-01

I found the fable/fairy tale form of the plot intriguing. This is almost a novel with short stories inbetween as the novel branches out like a tree. Each of the  hundred's of trees has a story sometimes told through the narrator, other  time's told by Ellen's suitor. The narrator freely interupts his story, as  if he telling you the novel in a friendly chat. I could see this annoying  people. Ellen is certianly a strange character, who overall hates her place  in life, yet does very little about it herself. I actually like the  description and story of the trees over her story. It produced so many  images of Australia and the Australian landscape in a very readible format.  Eucalyptus is an uncoventional novel about an unconventional situation	2000-04-29

As the title suggests, Rise of a Merchant Prince is primarily about Roo Avery. Much of the first novel is about Erik, though Roo is there in most of the novel. To me 'Rise' has many plot twists that are too convient and  sudden: Erik suddenly pulled out of the main story, Roo's father in law's  murder, and even the ending. In terms of advancing the plot in the series,  maybe a third of the novel is devoted to it. It felt like the novel took  awhile to really go and when it did, it barely went anywhere. The ending  feels very arbitrary and unnatural. While I plan on reading the rest of the  series, I can only hope they are better than this one. Roo is a more  complicated character than most of Feist's characters in having a different  set of morals than most of his usual characters that are usually easy to  guess their actions. I have to give Fiest credit for trying new things with  his characters.	2000-04-17

Rob's disregard for everyone, the  students he is supposed to protect, and even for his own wife makes him a  very unsympathetic character. You almost wish he would be institutionalized  if not killed by Bunker Man, as the novel's cover sets you up for. Despite  being the title character, Bunker Man is barely present in the novel. This  is one of the most offensive novels I've ever read. It overflows with  crudity that sinks the weak almost non exsistant plot. It seems at many  times that MacLean doesn't care about any of his characters which I find  lacks discernment. I fail to see how anyone could praise this fault ladden  novel, yet alone publish it.

I did like the  Isles concept and some of  Isles left many questions unanswered, such  as why would they use inches and miles in an imaginary world? Wouldn't they  have their own units of measurements. Not to mention Oaks, Hickory and  other American trees. Please get creative. How do all the main characters  like Garric have magic abilities and so on, while few others do?

I've read several tellings of the &quot;Arthur&quot; legend and I feel that this one is the most historically accurate, cutting through the romantic rubble that has built up with recent movies like 'First Knight'.  This novel reminded me very much of Epic Legends such as &quot;Song of  Roland&quot; and &quot;the Iliad&quot;, just in  battle after battle, but I  like the Point of View of how it came to be written down from the past  experience from someone that 'was actually' there. That in itself is very  realistic. I recommend 'The Winter King' to people who want a realistic  story verses a fantastic, romantic Knight in shinging armor version.  I do recommend T.H.

The irony is that at one point I was so mad at the way the story was progressing I could have literally thrown the book down and written my own ending, but I wanted to know what actually happened. Goodkind's characters are so real and vividly described that I truly cared what happened to them. I don't remember the last time I felt that way about a book I was reading. Goodkind is also excellent at showing how good or evil his characters are, not just telling. He shows how evil the villians are, but there deeds and how much they enjoy their twisted acts. I highly recommend this book, even if you have not read the previous three books in this series.	1997-12-02
