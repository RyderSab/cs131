Larry Corbett is a pastor and religious leader with experience serving in 6 congregations. His experience working in a nonprofit organization gives him a distinctive perspective of leadership. Jerre Stead has experience as a CEO and board member. Previously he served in executive positions with the Square D Company, AT&T's Global Business Communications, the Legent Corporation and Ingram Micro. His experience working in the free market business environment also gives him a distinctive perspective of leadership. Together these two authors from different backgrounds and business cultures have written a book to compare and expound on their experiences. <br /> <br />  <br />The purpose of the book is to guide the reader to \\"Begin a successful enterprise, whether in business or the church, to guide success\\". In eight chapters, Leadership Unbound attempts to take the reader through the steps a leader must navigate, beginning with a vision, values, planning, building and maintaining. It also outlines how the role of leadership changes as the organization grows. <br /> <br />  <br />The format of the book is simply a series of statements or ideas presented to initiate discussion. Each statement is answered individually by Larry and Jerre. Often the discussion goes back and forth as they build on each other's personal examples and career perspective. Each chapter and discourse ends with a group of planning questions designed to stimulate your thinking and strategy. It is interesting to note that not only do they have some different approaches to successful leadership; they also share some common practices and principles. One of these is the knowledge that every organization needs superior leadership to flourish and grow strong. Leadership Unbound is a solid publication that looks at leading from a different angle. Sometimes the interaction between the authors on certain subjectsseems disconnected. However, if you have a special interest in the distinctions between \\"for profit\\" and nonprofit leaders (or secular and religious), this may be the book you are looking for.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-08-29

T. B. Fisher has written this book to inform and encourage leaders that they can remain true to their own values and individuality without \\"buying-in\\" to the command and control corporate environment. Fisher does this in an amusing way that often leaves you to ponder his convictions long after the book is closed. <br /> <br />Why Buy In? is formatted to be read one page per week for an entire 52 week year. Each weekly page offers a few philosophical paragraphs that distill the wisdom of T.B. Fisher from his years of surviving the \\"international corporate circus\\". The end of each page offers a weekly personal statement validating positive principles or opportunities for growth. Also buried within the book like jewels to be discovered, are Fisher's own 12 steps to business independence. For example, on Week 34 Fisher cautions the reader not to let strong morals and unwavering ideals grow into inflexibility and the appearance of being a control freak. The concluding weekly personal statement ends by affirming, \\"My eighth step is to assure myself everyday that my quest to maintain my straight path of ideals doesn't become a narrow path of one-way thinking\\".  <br /> <br />If you consider yourself a free thinker, this is a book you will definitely want to read. It will make you chuckle, and it will make you nod your head and say, \\"that is right-on\\". But perhaps the biggest benefit of the book is that it will remind you why you celebrate your individuality and have chosen not to sacrifice your true soul to fit into a dysfunctional corporate world. <br /> <br />	2005-07-28

That Lead to Your Success is part of a series of fine books by David Cottrell. He is a prolific author and professional speaker on the topics of leadership, personal development and customer service. David Cottrell's writing style is succinct, direct and easy to comprehend. <br /> <br />  <br />12 Choices... That Lead to Your Success is based on the principle that our daily choices determine our future and level of success. As Cottrell states in the Introduction, \\"Our daily challenge is to live our character, action and investment choices so naturally that we make the best choices almost subconsciously. This requires patience, honest reflection, adaptation, and commitment\\". As is hinted in this sentence, this book divides the 12 Choices into three categories or types of decisions we make...character, action and investment. Each of the 12 choices are discussed in their own chapter within the book. <br /> <br />  <br />The four \\"Character choices\\" we make are known only to the person making them and are 1) No-Victim, 2) Commitment, 3) Values and 4) Integrity. Cottrell considers these the foundation of success. The four \\"Action\\" choices we make are 5) Do-something, 6) Persistence, 7) Attitude and 8) Overcoming Adversity. These choices engage one in movement toward success. The four \\"Investment\\" choices include 9) Relationships, 10) Accepting criticism, 11) Accepting reality, and 12) Leaving a legacy. These are the choices that allow one to reap the joys and profit of achieving success.  <br /> <br />  <br />12 Choices... That Lead to Your Success does not break any new ground or add deeper insight into understanding the individual choices. However, it collects these valuable principles into an easy to read format that gets directly to the heart of decision-making. Attaining success is certainly more complicated than presented in this book, but understanding and appreciating these 12 Choices is an excellent start. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-07-27

In the future we will be recommending Daring to Be Different as an extended answer to this important question. Author James Hatherley shares his varied experience as a senior vice president of a Fortune 150 company, and a lively writing style to powerfully discuss the kind of leadership that makes great things happen. Hatherley draws a broad distinction between traditional monarchic managing and muralistic leading. Muralistic leaders are defined by the author with traits similar to that of \\"servant-leaders\\", including the ability to articulate a clear vision, the building of trust, mentoring, and commitment to the values and success of the mission. The author candidly exposes what monarchic managers typically do to organizations and their cultures. The negative consequences of this management approach continues to plague the majority of organizations today. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />As Hatherley writes, \\"Success for muralists comes from developing mutual trust among team members, and challenging them to test the limits of their individual and collective skills. By identifying the goals of the mission, yet disavowing knowledge of all the answers, the muralist creates a sense of mutual discovery within the team\\". <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Hatherley has a unique gift of translating daily and abstract events into metaphorical lessons for the reader. This adds greater interest and insight in this interesting work. One example is his discussion of both the lifters and leaners who inhabit an average organization. Lifters are defined as those who uplift the organization and upgrade the quality of individual performance. On the other hand, the \\"meeting and committee oriented\\" leaners are those who block opportunities and derail progress. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Daring to Be Different also takes the reader beyond the text with charts to ponder such as the four quadrants of a Leadership Compass and a Leadership Continuum for self-assessment. The book is divided into 22 chapters and is an easy read. Daring to Be Different is a call to action that hopes to inspire managers to transform themselves and their thinking toward muralistic leading! The benefits of doing this are strongly outlined in this exceptional book. If you desire to become a real leader, and are willing to abandon the \\"paper handcuffs\\" that exist in most organizations today, this book will challenge and enlighten you.  <br /> <br />	2005-06-20

The same cycle seems to exist in most organizations today. A new employee is hired with a natural enthusiasm for their new job. They are eager to establish a new path in their career and to be part of a productive organizational team. However, in about 6 months something begins to happen to 9 out of 10 employees after this \\"honeymoon period\\" is over! The enthusiastic employee becomes discouraged or disillusioned and this has a serious impact on their performance. The Enthusiastic Employee maintains that this is the result of poor management practices. In other words, it is management that kills enthusiasm. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The three authors of this excellent work are members of the same consulting firm. Yet, they all bring with them diverse backgrounds in business that compliments each others skills and knowledge. The Enthusiastic Employee is not a book that simply parrots their own opinions, theories or ideas. It is the result of over three decades of research. Yet, most of the data presented is recent. The analysis presented in the book is from surveys taken between 1994 and 2003. Since 1994 the authors surveyed over 2.5 million employees in 237 private, public and not-for-profit- organizations located in 89 countries. The results consist of a combination of both qualitative and quantitative data.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Yet, the significant contribution of The Enthusiastic Employee doesn't end with a sound analysis of the survey results. The authors go on to offer solid solutions to real world employee morale problems. They provide interesting data and stimulating \\"case studies\\" to show it is indeed possible to develop and maintain enthusiastic employees! Most of the book's chapters discuss what the authors refer to as the \\"Three Factor Theory\\". These are management practices that promote and maintain employee enthusiasm. Employees naturally seek to satisfy three importantneeds to remain motivated. These factors are equity, achievement and camaraderie. When these needs are being met by management, a great degree of enthusiasm, often beyond what they are being paid for, is generated toward achieving organizational goals. These three factors interact with each other in an interesting way and are what separate the great organizations for the good ones. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The final chapter of The Enthusiastic Employee (Chapter 12) ties the information together and shows a leader how the right kind of practices and policies can create a \\"partnership\\" culture. This chapter also provides guidance on how to generate a positive cultural change within an organization. The book concludes with a number of Appendices that publish much of the actual research and data the authors discovered during their surveys and research. This outstanding book comes highly recommended and if you are concerned about employee morale problems in your organization (or your own) you will become an enthusiastic reader of this well written publication. <br />	2005-06-20

As a male reader, my initial reaction was there wouldn't be much in it for me. I was wrong! The author has done an excellent job of revealing the clear and significant differences between men and woman in the workplace. Modern culture perpetuates a silly myth that men and woman are equal in every way... they just have a few parts different in anatomical design. The plain truth as Ronnie Lichtenberg explains is that we are \\"wired differently\\". This does not make one sex better or superior than another. We are unique by design and react differently in various situations. Men and woman also approach problems and challenges from different perspectives. This is as it should be, and trying to be something you are not, or conforming to others' expectations only leads to frustration.  <br /> <br />Pitch Like a Girl is a refreshing book because the author believes women in the workplace don't have to change who and what they really are to succeed. She believes the real secret to success is to tap \\"more fully and consciously into the woman you already are\\". Litchenberg proposes that the key to fulfillment is to bring more of yourself to work, and to receive more back from it. To promote this she encourages the reader to discover their own \\"pitch\\". The \\"pitch\\" may be different for each individual, but as a powerful tool it will help you to exercise your natural skills of persuasion to influence others toward your point of view. This is accomplished by developing the skill set most women have acquired by nurturing and building personal relationships. <br /> <br />I enjoyed reading Pitch Like a Girl and it reminded me of the many barriers that still exist in the workplace for women. It also highlights the problems created when talented females feel forced to think and react just like their male counterparts. This fine publication is a pleasure to read and many parts are Lichtenberg's own autobiography which helps explain her philosophy and passion. The book is broken down into five chapters and each is seasoned with checklists, sidebars and thought-provoking questions. Pitch Like a Girl also includes some self-analysis testing and even has one appendix for guys to read. <br /> <br />Overcoming cultural expectations can be difficult. But, to be successful and fulfilled at the same time means being who and what you are intended to be on the inside and outside. This book will appeal to both female and male readers because it teaches us to respect each other for our mutual differences. When you understand and appreciate these differences, and view them as genuine strengths, you know that what the French mean when they say, \\"viva la difference\\". <br /> <br />	2005-03-27

As a wealthy CEO, his personal life literally crashed and his following journey toward self-discovery prompted him to write this book. Dibble clearly understands that the modern workplace is riddled with ineffectiveness and complacency generated by fear. Many other authors and consultants have proposed a new agreement, or alternative culture in the modern workplace including Robert Greenleaf, Peter Drucker, Peter Block and many others. This book proposes a dramatic change in the workplace influenced by the author's own journey, and personal interest in systems theory and Toltec spirituality. He believes the book will help one discover a \\"revolutionary idea that is desperately needed in the modern business world: love.\\" The influence of Toltec was most prominently introduced to the public by DON Miguel Ruiz, author of two best selling books. He also writes an introduction in this work. <br /> <br />The New Agreements in the Workplace is a short publication that you can read in one or two sittings. All eight chapters are well organized as Dibble outlines 5 proposed New Agreements in the Workplace and quickly weaves them together. Many of the ideas in this book are similar to servant-leadership principles but with more of a definite spiritual edge. The only major weakness in the book is that not enough detail is given to define and explore the new agreements in a culture that is presently contrary to its ideals! It is easy to make an enlightened statement and express new found knowledge, but how to implement that knowledge to produce change in the real world is the hard part. <br /> <br />If you are not into spirituality or resist rather vague concepts, The New Agreements in the Workplace may not appeal to you. But, if you are looking for a book that offers a sensitive and alternative approach to problem-solving in the workplace, it may be a profound journey. <br />	2005-03-27

They help people become more and achieve more than they ever thought possible\\". This reoccurring question, along with 20 years of experience has guided Thornton to write his latest book, Leadership (Seeing, Describing, and Pursuing What's Possible). <br /> <br />  <br />Composed of 17 short chapters, Leadership is a quick read and an interesting collection of leadership discoveries and observations by Thornton. This relevant and absorbing information is organized very well. The first 4 chapters lay the foundation for the entire book. Chapter 1 begins by offering a broad yet helpful definition of what leadership is. Like building blocks, the following chapters include a discussion of leadership context, desire, values and beliefs. Later chapters include Thornton's guidance on existing Leadership models, leading organizational change, and leadership development. Each chapter concludes with a summary and the book concludes with a number of brief leadership case studies. <br /> <br />  <br />A major strength of Leadership is its ability to provide essential and basic leadership knowledge in a writing style that is easy to read and comprehend. Even though the author is a full-time college professor, he does not write like many academics who seem to be more interested in demonstrating their large vocabulary rather than imparting useful information to the reader.  <br /> <br />  <br />If you desire to read a book about the real power of leadership in an effective way that \\"gets to the point\\", Leadership needs to be on your bookshelf.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-23

Most books written about leadership are penned in a non-fictional format. What you read is what you get. Little is left to the imagination as the writers directly impart their ideas from one paragraph to another. The Baron Son uses a different approach. It is written as a fictional story about a wise baron who acts as a revered tutor and slowly imparts knowledge to three young disciples. The end result of this approach is that the reader is left to glean from the visionary wisdom and teachings of the baron. The longer you ponder upon each major \\"supreme principle\\" as revealed by the baron, the more you personally benefit from his insight.      The three authors weave a large number of moral and successful business principles in this interesting allegorical fable. As you read The Baron Son you come to learn that hard work and effort of itself will not ensure the achievement of goals and personal fulfillment. It is hard work combined with wisdom and proper actions that make it all possible. In this mythical story the wise baron imparts eleven \\"supreme principles\\" to his young pupils. The authors don't break new ground with these valid principles, but they present this knowledge in a fascinating way.    The Baron Son is truly distinctive and will appeal to readers who enjoy fiction. It is a book that can be read in just a few sittings and one that continues to reveal wisdom long after the book is closed and you ponder on its contents! If you primarily read and enjoy non-fiction, this may not be your cup of tea. But, if you want to learn some sound principles about business, wealth and leadership through a fictional narrative, The Baron Son will make your cup runneth over.	2005-03-23

It is sold as a companion book to Giuliani's best selling book, Leadership (two volume set). The book is introduced by Rudy Giuliani who has put together a collection of over 250 inspiring leadership quotations from individuals like Lee Iacocca, Will Rogers, Martin Luther King, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and many others. Giuliani explains why he compiled these quotations by saying, \\"...leadership is mostly a skill that people learn. They learn from their parents, from their friends and colleagues, from their teachers, and from their clergy. But leaders also learn from leaders they've never met - by reading about them\\". <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />These quotations are organized in 20 subject chapters and include titles like character, compassion, vision, conviction, action, inspiration, failure and teamwork. Some of these quotations are well known but others are unique. Leadership Through the Ages is intended to provoke serious thought and reflection. Here are a few examples... <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Example moves the world more than doctrine. <br /> <br />-         Henry Miller <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it. <br /> <br />-         Edith Wharton <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />A leader should not get too far in front of his troops or he will get shot in the ass. <br /> <br />     - Joseph Clark <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Leadership Through the Ages is the kind of book to read when you are sitting by a crackling fire on a cold winter eve.

The obvious premise of this book is that \\"ideas\\" can transform an average company into a great one, or a struggling organization into a competitive success. The power to achieve this is in simple everyday ideas from the people who really know where the problems exist, the front line workers. Alan Robinson and Dean Schroeder have written a book that has its origins in the 1980's. Schroeder had discovered that the \\"employees of distressed companies could often identify and solve critical problems which management had either missed or ignored\\". Around the same time, Robinson was studying Japanese organizations and discovering how small ideas could lead to high employee involvement and superior performance. This book is a result of their research that led them into 150 different organizations in seventeen countries representing a diverse variety of industries.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Ideas Are Free is a book that discusses how everyday common-sense ideas can make a powerful difference in any organization! Most American organizational cultures constantly search for the \\"big\\" revolutionary ideas that often are quickly duplicated by the competition. But it is the ongoing benefits derived from smaller innovations that can really make a huge difference. These small ideas tend to remain proprietary within the organization that utilizes them. Sadly, most organizations seem to ignore this opportunity and are better at suppressing ideas instead of promoting them! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Ideas Are Free correctly focuses on the fact that the best ideas come from people who do the work and see many things the manager doesn't. Managers are good at squandering the most significant resource that organizations possess: employee ideas. Aside from innovation, another advantage of utilizing the ideas of employees is that the process pushes the decision-making authority back down to the people who do the work where it belongs. A secondary benefit is that managers are reminded every day of how valuable and productive ideas from the \\"front-line\\" can be. This should remind the manager to be less arrogant and more humble.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This book is organized into eight chapters. Chapter 1 convinces the reader that small ideas can drive a culture of high performance. It also provides an overview of the books main points. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with the importance of going after small ideas, and examines why most common reward systems fail. Chapter 5 discusses how to create an effective process to deal with many new ideas, and how to make idea generation a part of everyone's job. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on helping employees engender more and better ideas, and how to make a good idea system a truly great one. Chapter 8 shows how a sound ideas system can make a positive change in the organization's culture. Most chapters end with suggested actions that any manager can adopt to promote ideas called \\"Guerrilla Tactics\\". <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Ideas Are Free is excellent reading and one that can inspire a manager to tap into any organization's greatest untapped natural resource... it's people! <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

But what exactly is meant by \\"systems thinking\\"? This concise, twenty-page publication, which is a part of the Innovations In Management Series from Pegasus Communications, is an excellent place to obtain an introduction to the world of systems thinking, including why systems thinking is important to leaders and managers in companies trying to become learning organizations. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Daniel Kim, the author of Introduction to Systems Thinking, is co-founder of Pegasus Communications Inc., and co-founder of the MIT Center for Organizational Learning. He is a trustee of the Society for Organizational Learning (SoL), and is the author of a number of publications dealing with systems thinking. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />We hear the word \\"system\\" used all the time, but what exactly is a system, and what is meant by systemic behavior? This to-the-point publication explains these terms, compares \\"systems\\" to \\"collections\\", and shows how one might convert a collection into a system. It illuminates the importance of identifying a systems purpose, and briefly explains how both physical and intangible systemic structures generate patterns and events. It further explains how our tendency as human beings is to see events (and possibly patterns from a number of similar events) yet remain unaware of the systemic structures and processes that are actually generating these events. By closely examining systemic behavior and redesigning systems, the author shows how we can shift from simply reacting to events to more proactive behavior. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Finally, this brief introduction explains reinforcing and balancing processes, feedback, delay, flow, stock, and leverage points. It introduces the reader to a number of important tools used in systems thinking such as theBehavior Over Time (BOT) Graph, the Causal Loop Diagram (CLD), and Systems Archetypes-the common patterns and structures that occur repeatedly in different system settings. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br />If you are interested in learning how to identify and solve real problems rather than just treating apparent problems, then this brief introduction to systems thinking may be just the right place to start you on your learning. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Review By Dr. J.

Paul Thornton uses his years of experience as a trainer and consultant to write a practical book that clearly makes sense of the complex qualities of leadership. Be The Leader is composed of six (VI) parts. The author begins his introduction by stating, \\"Leadership requires someone who has the desire and willingness to initiate action, make decisions, and take risks others don't want to face\\". <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Part 1 is essential to appreciating the main focus of the book. It describes the unique 3-C Leadership Model as outlined by the author. The 3-C's are challenge, confidence and coaching. These are defined as 3 basic things that leaders do. Thornton discusses why and how these variables interact and how you as a leader can use it as \\"a basic formula for leadership success\\". The author concludes each part of the book with case studies to illustrate the pragmatic applications of his main concepts. Other parts of the book are equally valuable and include subjects such as challenging the status quo, building confidence in others, coaching to achieve top performance, setting the example by leading yourself and others. Part VI is an especially strong conclusion regarding personal leadership development. Paul Thornton challenges the reader to stretch their boundaries and implement a \\"practice-feedback-revisions cycle\\" to perfect their leadership skills. The book ends with a Be The Leader Survey and a self-analysis.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Be The Leader is a quick yet meditative reading about developing leadership in yourself and others. It gets to the point in a succinct no-nonsense way written by someone whose personal experience is readily reflected in its pages.   <br />	2004-12-21

This group, called the Core Group, is usually made up of most, but not all, of the people at the top of the organization chart. It may also include others.  A Core Group might be huge, or it might be small.  But be sure, if you have an organization, you will have a Core Group. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />A Core Group guides and controls the organization. Core Groups are informal networks of key people who set the direction of the organization. Only rarely will a secretary or aide rise to the level of Core Group member.  Usually they stand as gatekeepers to the real Core Group members. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The vast majority of employees are outside the Core Group.  They make up \\"employees of mutual consent.\\"  These are people who feel their jobs require them to protect the position and status of the Core Group.  The Core Group may consist of tenured faculty, established executives, or whoever the bureaucracy might be. The needs and wants of the Core Group actually come first, despite lip service that \\"the student comes first\\"  or \\"the customer comes first.\\"  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In fluid organizations membership in the Core Group shifts from year to year, while in other types of organizations, such as family firms, membership of the Core Group is fixed enough to last for generations.  When times get tough, sometimes a Core Group is streamlined, as in the case of \\"Welchism.\\" Jack Welch was brought in as CEO of GE in 1981 to turn the organization around.  He redefined the Core Group at GE-from a large body of employees with lifelong membership to a very small group of people whose membership is permanently insecure.  Those in the new Core Group were expected to have the same brash, hard-driving, energetic personality that Welch himself has. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Occasionally one finds an organization where the chief executive is barely a member of the Core Group. For instance, Art Kleiner points out that in some universities nothing happens without the approval of long-standing tenured faculty members in critical departments.  The president or dean has a limited term or limited power, and if he or she tries to change the organization, people simply say yes but ignore the changes. A dean may ask, \\"What is the difference between a tenured faculty member and a terrorist? You can negotiate with a terrorist.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In rare cases, such as Southwest Airlines, Scientific Applications (SAIG), Toyota, or St. Lukes Advertising Agency in London, an organization may have an expanded Core Group, where everyone's welfare and development is one of the entire organization's priorities. However, an \\"Expanded-Core Group\\" organization is difficult to create and maintain.  This is because it must continually refine and expand the financial and learning-and-development structures, trying to make them more transparent and inclusive. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The author explains why more organizations don't follow the model of Toyota or Southwest Airlines. It is \\"because it would require most Core Group members to fundamentally change-not just what they say, but how they think, how they are paid, how they carry themselves, and how they build relationships.\\"  He then points out that most Core Group members have an unconscious vested interest in keeping themselves and their organization going in the same pattern of basic management.  They have invested their careers, their habits, their thinking, and their feeling in an organization that maintains its current Core Group form. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Art Kleiner is a talented and seasoned writer. He worked as a collaborator withMIT lecturer Peter Senge, helping him conceive and edit his best seller, The Fifth Discipline.  He later collaborated with Senge to produce the follow-up Fifth Discipline Fieldbook series which included The Dance of Change and Schools That Learn.  He is a contributing editor at strategy+business magazine and the author of The Age of Heretics, which was a runner-up for the Edgar G. Booz Award for the most innovative business book of 1996.

Books	4	12	12	N	N	weLEAD Book Review from the Editor of leadingtoday.org	John Maxwell is a unique author who has been able to make the subject of spirituality acceptable in the study of leadership. His background in the religious world always brings a different perspective into his writings like in his highly successful book The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />In Today Matters, Maxwell again taps into his deep personal philosophies of the essential value of sound decision-making and discipline. This book lists 12 daily practices (he calls them the \\"Daily Dozen\\") which can help the reader to build a better life. He believes it is not only important to make good decisions but also to know what decisions to make and this requires a daily agenda. He defines success as, \\"If you make a few key decisions and manage them well in your daily agenda, you will succeed.\\" His successful philosophy is based on the belief that the right things we do today will give us a better tomorrow. With an optimistic perspective he believes that any given day can become a masterpiece, a term he borrows from former UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. This book is written around what Maxwell believes are the two ingredients of a daily masterpiece... good decisions and daily discipline.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Today Matters is fourteen chapters long and twelve of them focus on the individual practices that should be embraced each day. These include attitude, priorities, health, family, thinking, commitment, finances, faith, relationships, generosity, values and growth. He discusses these twelve practices in detail, and each chapter ends with exercises which can help you to apply them to your life. In the book's conclusion, Maxwell emphasizes that \\"it's impossible to tackle all twelve at the same time\\". He provides direction on how to slowly incorporate the \\"Daily Dozen\\" and presents a way to rate your present progress. This book is easy to read and Maxwell's many personal stories and famous quotations make it a delight to study. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />If you are wondering how you can glean the most out of each day of life and reorient your priorities, Today Matters is just the book you are looking for. <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

His military background and personal experiences have allowed him to offer a different perspective on the topics of leadership and followership. How to Unleash The Power of People is not your typical book. First of all it is a shareware ebook that can be downloaded, read and purchased ($10 US) from Simonton's website. Secondly, it reflects the experiences and conviction of an author who candidly admits that a personal conversion toward the importance of workers occurred in his life. He writes with the knowledge that early in his career he made many mistakes and false assumptions. His own personal growth has made Simonton fervent about his discoveries regarding leadership. He is passionate about his beliefs and you can feel the passion through his writing. This is especially demonstrated in Simonton's emphasis on the importance of values and high standards. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The book has 9 chapters and two appendixes. The first six chapters provide Simonton's view of basic leadership knowledge and understanding. Within these chapters he outlines what he refers to as 5Star people. How to Unleash The Power of People was written to provide the specific tools for any leader to turn themselves and others into \\"5Star Superstars\\". The final three chapters discuss the practical application of this knowledge. In these final chapters the author defines what he believes to be the \\"two most important mechanisms\\" for a leader to know and apply. These are GOTYP (Go Out To Your People) and Group Meetings. The appendixes compliment the original chapters with a candid discussion on successfully dealing with various workplace conditions and changing personal behaviors.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a book that boldly challenges much of the contemporary theory presented by management consultants, How to Unleash The Power of People will stimulate your thinking and may alter how you viewboth leadership and followership. It is written in a gritty and \\"no nonsense\\" style that is not afraid to tackle tough issues or concepts.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />As a shareware ebook you may find this publication easier to read if printed. This is easy to do and will totally print about 163 pages if printed on 8 \\" X 11\\" paper. <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

It is written in a way that draws you into the subject. The book begins by explaining why it was written. The author begins by explaining in the prologue a story about an executive named Jeff Walters. Jeff's life was falling apart. He was in a slump in his career, personal relationships and health. He needed help and was at a crossroads, desperately needing direction. He rekindles a relationship with an old friend of his father's named Tony Pearce. Tony, being a respected and successful semi-retired business leader, offers to help but only on two conditions.  The first condition is that the struggling executive must agree to meet with Tony every Monday morning for eight weeks of tutelage. The second condition is that the author must promise to teach others the experiences and lessons Tony teaches him. Monday Morning Leadership is the fulfillment of the second condition.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The eight chapters of the book are a synopsis of the Monday morning sessions with Tony. Jeff shows up with his spiral notebook ready to learn and grow. Each Monday morning session is educational and entertaining to read. There is no new ground covered here regarding known leadership principles, but the analogies used by Tony puts many in a new light. For example, in the third chapter (The Third Monday - Escape from Management Land) Jeff learns that many managers fall into a trap called management land. In this artificial world things are not always as they seem. Simple things become complex and games are played. People are rewarded not for performance but for saying the things managers want to hear. Jeff learns that he must \\"escape from management land and get in touch with your people\\". He also learns there are three types of employees or \\"stars\\" on every team and how to deal with them. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This is a book you will enjoy and it ends with a collection of quotations from Tony that are thought-provoking and helpful. You will be able to read it in one or two short sittings. Monday Morning Leadership deftly covers a number of important leadership principles in a refreshing way. If you want something different, easy to understand, and a pleasure to peruse, Monday Morning Leadership is a book for you. <br />	2004-12-21

His image was transformed at the terrorist attack in New York on September 11, 2001. Much of this book was written before this historical event as he prepared to leave office as mayor. After the attack Giuliani added chapter one and the final chapter (sixteen) to discuss the events of 9/11 and how he directed the recovery during the final four months of his administration. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Leadership is primarily a biography about the life and various experiences of Giuliani and how they prepared him to lead. He draws on his experiences as a U.S attorney, corporate lawyer and mayor to discuss the values and leadership principles he espouses. For example, Giuliani vividly describes the aggressive management style he used to deal with many problems in New York City from petty crime to cleaning up 42nd street, a notorious smut boulevard. The mayor achieved this by insisting that city government be treated and organized like a business organization. Giuliani mentions how he used the six sigma approach used by GE's Jack Welch to improve city services. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This is not a book that simply lists one leadership trait after another; it is more of a biography with some notable gaps in the author's life. Though he does not discuss his personal life in great detail, this is a book that will give you a deep insight into Rudolph Giuliani as a manager. It is peppered with his real life examples to illustrate the values he believes in and lives by. He uses various examples to show how and where he learned these leadership principles, and how he has used them in different situations of his life. One of the more interesting parts of Leadership is Giuliani's recollection of the people he has met in public life from various Mafia Dons, to a confrontation with Yasser Arafat.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The heart of Leadership is part II, the section reputedly written before the 9/11 event. Each of its thirteen chapters highlights a principle and numerous examples to teach and discuss a leadership quality. Some of these are... prepare relentlessly, underpromise and overdeliver, stand up to bullies and organize around a purpose. If you have read other books on the subject of leadership, you will not find much that is new in this book. However, if you would like to read about how leadership is applied successfully in the real world to solve complex and difficult problems, there may not be a better book on the market! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

In his book Managing Leadership he challenges the status quo and forces the reader to look at leadership from a different perspective. Stroup believes the typical definition of \\"leadership\\" used by most organizations should be \\"scrapped\\". He believes real leadership should not be centered on individuals. The end result of this single-leader approach includes unnecessary burdens placed on the individual leader, surrender of the stakeholders and organization to \\"the leaders\\" vision, a distorted view of managerial functions and loss of control. We are all familiar with the public crimes and business failures of many individuals formerly praised by the media as \\"leaders\\". Managing Leadership offers an alternative approach to what leadership essentially is. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Instead, Stroup observes that leadership is a characteristic of the organization and that it arises naturally from inside it. He writes in chapter 6, \\"Leadership from within the organization is a perfectly natural and ordinary occurrence. It has been remarked upon for centuries, but has not achieved the critical attention it deserves.\\" Therefore Stroup believes it should be managed like any other vital resource. He opines that leadership should be allowed to come from virtually anyone in the organization and be welcome at any time. The task of the senior executives should be to manage the leadership that is inherently within the organization.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Managing Leadership is organized into 3 parts broken down into 9 informative chapters. In part 1, the author introduces the reader to the problems that now exist within the study of leadership because of poor definition, false expectations and ineffective leadership theories. Within Part 2, Stroup applies some military examples (with caution) to the non-military environment to demonstrate that organizational leadership is not the characteristic of an individual, but of the organization. Chapter 7 provides helpful analysis on how to manage the assets of organizational leadership from the proper perspective. Concluding with part 3, the author discusses the differences between traditional ideas and approaches toward leadership, and the model of organizational leadership he has been proposing. Stroup applauds the \\"half steps\\" made by previous consultants like McGregor, Burns, Blanchard and Follett. He then provides a compelling case on why it is time to take a \\"full forward step\\" toward complete development of organizational leadership. He concludes with a brief discussion of the benefits of this achievement. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Managing Leadership achieves its stated purpose. It was Jim Stoup's hope that \\"I will have convinced enough readers to begin a debate on this topic that redirects the attention of professional students and practitioners of management back to the line of thinking begun by Mary Follett so long ago.\\" This well-written and challenging book is just what was needed. Let the debate begin! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

Blanchard, Hybels and Hodges set out to teach servant-leadership by returning to its religious roots. Leadership by the Book is written in the form of a parable or story. It portrays the interaction of three different leaders: a professor, minister and young business professional. The purpose of the book is to teach management skills and ethics by examining the example of Christianity's founder, Jesus Christ. As the authors state in the introduction, \\"We believe there is a perfect practitioner and teacher of effective leadership. That person is Jesus of Nazareth, who embodied the heart and methods of a fully committed and effective servant leader.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />However, this book is not intended to be either sectarian or a promotional treatise on Christianity and its founder. The authors continue, \\"In this book we invite students of leadership from all faiths, cultures and experience to take another look at the leadership genius of Jesus.\\" Throughout the text Blanchard, Hybels and Hodges endeavor to cite various examples of Jesus Christ as a source for learning valuable lessons in effective leadership. They also suggest basic strategies for bringing values and vision to any organization. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Many books written on servant leadership are authored by intellectuals who make this essential philosophy difficult to grasp and appreciate. This book is different. Leadership by the Book can be called a primer on servant leadership and is written in an easy to understand linguistic style. Don't let the number of pages fool you. With large print and generous word spacing, it can easily be read in one or two sittings.   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

Steward and he is a true success story! He has risen from humble beginnings, and confronted many personal setbacks to become founder and CEO of the largest African-American owned company in the United States. Doing Business by the Good Book is his personal story of the faith and perseverance that he credits for his success. Steward shares 52 principles from the Bible that he believes were intended to be implemented in business strategy and conduct. This is not simply a book that blandly presents 52 Biblical principles. It is David Steward's own story of how these 52 principles impacted his personal and family life to eventually build World Wide Technology, Inc., a privately held billion-dollar company. Doing Business by the Good Book is almost like reading a private diary. Steward discusses his own vivid experiences to teach about business management, ethics, strategy and personal leadership. At the heart of his value system are the Biblical scriptures frequently mentioned throughout the book. A central theme is his belief that giving and serving others is an essential ingredient to becoming highly successful. If an organization honestly serves its employees and customers, their response of loyalty will help achieve an impressive bottom line. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This book is organized into 52 short and readable chapters that can be read in one sitting, or digested as one chapter per week for an entire year. The chapters cover virtually every aspect of modern business and decision-making including integrity, delegation, adapting to change, teamwork, risk-taking, confrontation, mentoring, empowerment, accountability and many more. The foreword is written by former president of the United States, George H.W. Bush. Steward gives much credit and praise for his achievements to his supportive wife Thelma.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Doing Business by the Good Book is an outstanding publication to read whether you are religiousor not. Steward doesn't preach or lecture. He simply and gently teaches from the perspective of his personal example and experience like a seasoned old professor who has \\"done it all\\". At weLEAD, we rarely call a book inspirational, but this book certainly fulfills that definition. This is a needed and timely book, especially when you look at the evening news and see many business executives being prosecuted for serious crimes and unadulterated greed.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

Anyone who begins a serious study into this subject will soon come across familiar names such as John Gardner, James MacGregor Burns, Robert Greenleaf, Bernard Bass, Kenneth Blanchard, Terrence Deal, Warren Bennis, Max De Pree and others. Wouldn't it be wonderful if one book contained some of the most insightful writings and thoughts of these individuals? The Leaders Companion - Insights on Leadership Through the Ages is such a book and should be on every leader's bookshelf! <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This massive work is edited by J. Thomas Wren and he undertakes a difficult task. Wren constructs the book with three basic premises. First, that leadership is not just a modern \\"fad\\", but is \\"central to the human condition\\". Leadership as a concept is both current and timeless. The second premise of the book is that leadership is not just the province of a select few, but is available to all. Thirdly, and perhaps the most important premise is that leadership is a valuable area of study, especially the process of leadership. Wren hopes the reader will appreciate the \\"real end of leadership: the achievement of mutual goals which are intended to enhance one's group, organization or society.\\" <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />To initiate these premises the book approaches leadership from a broad perspective. Wren draws upon a broad range of classical writers, leadership scholars, and the wisdom of modern leaders. The book is divided into thirteen parts that guide the reader through the complex structure we commonly call leadership.  Wren acknowledges that understanding this process lies at the heart of improving our lives, surroundings, and world.  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />This book is an outstanding collection of various leadership perspectives and models. He has opened up the study of leadership through the ages and from a worldview of different cultures. The Leaders Companion - Insights on Leadership Through the Ages is great reading and should be part of your own leadership library!  <br /> <br />	2004-12-21

In fact, some of the most effective leaders in an organization may be those leading the boss! Leading up is about helping your superiors lead and do their job better. Everyone can lead up. Even if you are a CEO you will need to lead your board and stockholders. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Michael Useem, the author of Leading Up, is professor of management and the director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. His writing style uses detailed cases from military history, politics, business and even stories of Biblical figures to emphasize the need to lead up. I found some of the stories a bit long and detailed, going beyond what some readers might desire in order to grasp the point being made. However, if you enjoy this presentation style, the cases are well written and provide fascinating insights into actual historical events. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Professor Useem says that business has often looked to the military model for lessons in leadership \\"because of the seemingly impervious top-down authority system.\\" Using actual military stories, the author demonstrates that the military model can also offer invaluable lessons that are just the opposite. Encouraging your subordinates to say what is positive or negative about a plan before you impose an order can often avoid costly errors, or even save lives. Creating a culture that stimulates and rewards upward leadership is critical in today's complex environment where no single individual can possibly have all the answers. Useem says, \\"The military might appear to be the last place on earth where upward leadership is tolerated, but in fact such leadership is obligatory.\\" Encouraging upward challenges can keep a leader on course regarding adherence to principles. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />The book also forcefully demonstrates that redefining an institution's reality is one of the greatest tests of leading up. Changing well-established worldviews is certainly a difficult task, but the very fact that it is so difficult underscores the \\"overriding importance of achieving it.\\" Often the redefining of a superior's misplaced perceptions, or clarifying a superiors' understanding of a situation requires extraordinary steps. This is one of the greatest challenges to leading up. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Sometimes a subordinate must exercise the courage to ask the boss to elaborate and clarify inadequate instructions or an unclear strategy. Often a superior does not specifically seek this type of leading up. Nevertheless, such challenges can often make the difference between failure and success. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />If you enjoy reading detailed, but interesting leadership stories, accompanied by succinct lessons in leading up, then this is a book for you. If you are looking for a quick read of principles and leadership philosophy, you will not find that in this work. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />Review by Dr. J. Howard Baker <br />	2004-12-21

Bill George is the former Chairman and CEO of Medtronic, a leading medical technology company. He also serves on a number of corporate boards and has demonstrated a career of successful achievement. This is a book you will enjoy reading. First of all it is written from his heart. He confides late in the book that he wrote it himself and did not use a ghost writer. This is a refreshing confession because far too many executives who agree to commit their ideas to publishing ventures use ghost writers. It is an easy read and you get the \\"feel\\" from Bill George that you are casually enjoying a meal with him, as he discusses his personal reflections and ideas on leadership. The core of the book is outlined in the first chapter. George writes, \\"I believe that leadership begins and ends with authenticity. It's being yourself; the person you were created to be. That is not what most of the literature on leadership says, nor is it what the experts in corporate America teach. Instead they develop lists of leadership characteristics one is supposed to emulate. They describe the styles of leaders and suggest you adopt them. This is the opposite of authenticity. It is about developing the image or persona of a leader.\\" <br /> <br />Bill George goes on to explain that authentic leaders \\"genuinely desire to serve others through their leadership\\". This includes truly understanding yourself and your own strengths and weaknesses. Authentic Leadership boldly discusses the moral aspects needed to demonstrate effective modern leadership in a complex world. It is not afraid to discuss the crucial need to practice solid values, possessing a caring heart, establishing enduring relationships and demonstrating self-discipline. What also makes this book worth reading is that it has heart! The author discusses his personal journey to become an Authentic Leader that brings the subject to life. In the final chapter he briefly discusses what he considers to be \\"the greatest failure in his career\\". Though the circumstances occurred many years before this book was written, you can still sense the pain he feels from this unfortunate event.<br /> <br />Authentic Leadership is organized into 17 chapters which are divided into 4 parts. Part one discusses becoming an Authentic Leader. Part two describes how to build an Authentic Company. Part three analyzes corporate survival in the marketplace, including pitfalls, overcoming obstacles, innovation and the role of shareholders. Part four contemplates the needs of sound governance, and provides a long-term succession strategy. A powerful epilogue pulls the ideas of the book together and encourages the reader to accept the call of leadership where they are right now. This is one of those rare books where you feel you get to really know the author, and you like what you discover. If you want to read a book that embodies the practical side of servant-leadership and a man who has discovered it, Authentic Leadership should be on your shopping list!	2004-02-16

It is now over ten years old but is still used by many universities as a textbook for their leadership or business classes. Gardner can truly be called a renaissance man due to his many talents and achievements. With a formal education in psychology he has been a teacher, corporate officer, public-servant in the government, respected author, and military officer. He was awarded the Presidential Metal of Freedom in 1964. Through these experiences he has learned much about leaders and the subject of leadership. On Leadership is written from the heart and discusses the author's philosophy and personal reflections on what it takes to lead others. He defines leadership as \\"the process of persuasion or example by which an individual (or leadership team) induces a group to pursue objectives held by the leader or shared by the leader and his or her followers\\".<br /> <br />Gardner begins by stressing the lack of leadership in the U.S. He believes this is a critical problem and opines that new leaders are desperately needed to tackle the obvious monumental societal problems that exist in our culture. Much of the book has a common thread on the critical need for leadership development. The author frequently uses historical examples to highlight his theories on leadership. On Leadership begins by stressing that understanding real leadership is an important first step. Leaders must be accountable, and must be held accountable for their actions and the direction they are taking us. He also does not shy away from a bold discussion on the importance of shared values, ethics, integrity and responsibility. A major emphasis of this work is that individuals at all segments of society must be prepared to demonstrate initiative and responsible leadership. He refers to this as dispersed leadership. Gardner stresses that, \\"Vitality at middle and lower levels of leadership can produce greater vitality in the higher levels of leadership\\".<br /> <br />The seventeen chapters of the book culminate with a \\"call to action\\" and a foretaste of what future possibilities might lie ahead if we heed the call. In the last chapter entitled The Release of Human Possibilities, Gardner envisions that \\"what leaders see on the surface can be discouraging - people, even very able people, caught in the routines of life, thinking short-term, plowing narrow self-beneficial furrows through life. What leaders have to remember is that somewhere under that somnolent surface is the creature that builds civilizations, the dreamer of dreams, the risk taker. And, remembering that, the leader must reach down to the springs that never dry up, the ever-fresh springs of the human spirit.\\"<br /> <br />You may or may not agree with all the ideas and concepts that On Leadership presents. However, you will certainly be given a tremendous amount of material for personal reflection and self-discovery. This is a good book and the only weakness may exist in a few sections that are difficult to read due to an academic orientation and background.	2004-02-16

Other books are written to fulfill a strong personal interest by the author. It is the rare book that is written because there is a deeply genuine need for it. Making Diversity WORK is that rare book that was written for all the reasons above. Author Sondra Thiederman attempts to strip off the \\"veneer\\" of diversity that exists in the modern workplace to examine the real reasons why diversity is hard to talk about and even harder to achieve! This book may make you uncomfortable, but maybe that is exactly what we all need to feel in order to achieve a level of diversity that respects and honors all people for what they can contribute. <br /> <br />Early on in this work Sondra Thiederman candidly discusses her own cultural background and how she recognized her own personal biases. The purpose is to show that if we honestly examine ourselves and become mindful of our biases, we can dissect and set those biases aside. After spending 25 years providing practical results to some of the largest international organizations in their quest for diversity, Thiederman is a leading expert on this subject and it is prominently reflected in this book. She also received a doctorate in cross-cultural studies from UCLA.<br /> <br />Making Diversity WORK has three major parts which are embedded in thirteen interesting chapters. Each chapter ends with a conclusion and summary to reinforce their major points. Part one examines the basics of bias including the correct and incorrect definitions of bias, and how it is learned and taught to all of us. It is in this part that you will learn the term Guerilla Bias and how it can affect us in subtle ways. The second part of the book is the largest and deals with self-discovery, how our biases can hurt us and how we can strive to overcome them. The third part of the book is about creating healthy dialogue which the author calls gateway events. What are these events? Our workplaces arefilled with opportunities to engage in conversations about bias. Typically there is discord in the work environment between people who are different from each other. These incidents are capable of bringing about productive dialogue and serve as gateways to create greater understanding and reduce bias. This final part also outlines some cognitive and verbal skills to generate diversity dialogue.  <br /> <br />Diversity isn't just a good thing to do; morally it is the right thing to do. Our modern workplace is more diverse than ever before in recorded human history. Diversity means a greater talent pool, larger markets, and the unfortunate potential for discord in the workplace. Making Diversity WORK is a frank and powerful book that dares to challenge us and prods us to live up to the democratic ideals of fairness, equity and accountability. If you desire to read just one powerful book on this important subject, Making Diversity WORK should be it!	2004-02-16

We will give Leadership Presence credit for a truly novel and effective approach. Unlike most leadership authors Belle Linda Halpren and Kathy Lubar do not come from a strictly business school, military or academic background. It may be the very reason why this book is so enjoyable to read! The authors are highly skilled actresses and taught acting skills in Repertory Theater. Many of the students they had were various professionals including teachers, doctors, businesspeople and others. Because these individuals were able to use the theatre skills they acquired effectively in the workplace, the authors founded the Ariel Group in 1992. Since that time the Ariel Group has presented workshops to over 30,000 executives. This book is a result of that effort and the results achieved.<br /> <br />The main theme of Leadership Presence is simple yet profound. The authors define Leadership Presence as the \\"ability to connect authentically with the thoughts and feelings of others in order to motivate and inspire them to achieve a desired outcome\\". Throughout the book you will find a special emphasis on the word \\"authentic\\". This is not a book about motivating or manipulating others by using acting skills or pretence. It is a book that focuses on learning to authentically connect with the minds and hearts of others to effectively lead. Far too many business leaders conduct themselves in ways they think their executive roles require, rather than being themselves based on their heartfelt values. The result is that they come across as inauthentic and this breeds a lack of trust. The authors spend an admirable amount on the importance of values and introduce the reader to what they call the PRES Model of Leadership Presence.<br /> <br />Leadership Presence was written to teach techniques that will help the leader to motivate, inspire and reach out to others.It will help the reader to enhance relationships, build collaboration and flexibly deal with challenging situations. The book is composed of nine chapters divided into four sections suitably called \\"Acts\\". Act I discusses how one can learn to be completely in the moment. Act II analyzes the skills available to build relationships. Act III examines the appropriate way to express emotions and feelings. Act IV focuses on being yourself and reflecting your values in your behavior. Most chapters end with a section on exercises or practice guidelines to cement the information taught in the preceding chapter. Numerous personal stories and examples provided by the authors keep the material interesting and practical.<br /> <br />If you are new to the study of leadership you will enjoy this book. If you have read dozens of books on the study of leadership, you will love this book because it views this complex subject from a truly innovative and helpful angle. Sometimes we can get so immersed in a subject we can't \\"see the forest for the trees\\". Leadership Presence is one of those unique books that will help you to step back and see the forest because it gets to the very heart of leadership...authentic behavior and values.	2004-02-16

He also has extensive experience as an organizational consultant. It is from this experience he has written The Spirit of Leadership. The main point of the book is valid and clearly expressed. Far too many individuals in leadership positions spend a large amount of energy and resources to improve the products or processes of their organizations with mediocre results. As Spitzer comments in the introduction of this book, \\"Joe had blinded himself consistently to one of the three Ps of leadership. By concentrating on product and process, he had altogether ignored people\\". <br /> <br />The Spirit of Leadership correctly emphasizes that when people are ignored; their essential spirit is stifled resulting in a lack of trust, common cause, participation, teamwork and creativity. The purpose of the book is to show the reader how to create a espirit de corps within the heart of an organization. Spitzer defines this as the ability to transcend the material world to \\"gain energy when doing something creative\\". He continues to define espirit de corps in terms of the capacity to go beyond the self, or beyond known paradigms, or to become more alive. He believes this is fostered by three elements: vision, rational communication and four sets of commitments discussed in the book. This allows for an environment of inspired and motivated workers as well as high performing teams.<br /> <br />The Spirit of Leadership is composed of eighteen chapters within five well organized sections. The sections are entitled, The Mind and Vision of the Inspired Leader, The Heart of the Inspired Leader, People Commitments, Ethical Commitments and Leadership Commitments. As you can tell by these titles, Spitzer believes a great leader must have a consistent and heartfelt commitment toward growing people, sound moral behavior, and the responsibility that comes with being a leader! He begins the book by making acompelling case for the need of Inspired Leadership, in contrast to the traditional Driven Leadership we see so often in organizations today. He concludes the book with how to create a espirit de corps in your organization. Many chapters are featured with numerous steps, stages or points to clarify the author's main ideas. <br /> <br />The Spirit of Leadership does not break new ground, but it is a good read. Some of the strengths of the book are its readability, ethical foundation and it's many charts that condense larger ideas into visual snapshots. If you believe and understand the importance of building people in your organization, this may be a good book for your library.	2004-02-16

If You Haven't Got the Time to Do It Right, When Will You Find the Time To Do It Over is such a book. Mayer has spent much of his career as a time management consultant and he has written a basic primer for those interested in organizing their lives to a greater degree. <br /> <br />Most of us are being required to do more work with fewer people. How to get this increased workload accomplished is a common problem. Mayer asks, \\"But are we really increasing our productivity, or just the number of hours we work?\\" He then offers a solution. The key to getting work done is not simply to work harder and longer but smarter! Better organization is a solution. This book is centered on the principle of \\"save time by wasting less of it!\\" The author uses his vast experience to offer ideas, techniques, and concepts to save time and use it more effectively.<br /> <br />If You Haven't Got the Time to Do It Right, When Will You Find the Time To Do It Over provides common sense ideas that really work if we are willing to apply them. Being creatures of habit we tend to do things because that is the way they have typically been done. Mayer has boldly stepped out of the habitual routine to find ways to overcome daily obstacles to time and productivity. He attempts to show how time can be saved in \\"small pieces\\" rather than in large blocks. He ponders, \\"Save thirty seconds every five minutes, and by the end of the day, you've saved an hour.\\" The book is divided into two parts. The first part shows you how to organize your workspace including your office, files management and desk. The second part shows you how to streamline your entire business to become more productive and organized.<br /> <br />This is a useful and rewarding book. If it helps you to change only one routine in your life due to its beneficial ideas it will have served a valuable purpose. Easy to read and understand from cover to cover!	2004-02-16

Even if you are not an Information Technology professional, this book might be for you.  The authors state that the primary audience for the book is managers and knowledge workers within organizations that depend heavily on Information Technology (IT). That covers almost all managers and knowledge workers today!  If you manage any complex task, are involved in improving how information is used within your organization, or are involved in any form of project management, this book is a worthy read.<br /> <br />The book is intentionally written in a nontechnical style for managers as well as IT professionals-from programmers to Chief Information Officers (CIOs).  The authors present numerous profound principles that can be applied to project management in general, as well as the management of IT projects in particular.<br /> <br />The fundamental concept behind the book is that \\"managers do not have to become experts in technology to make effective use of it.\\"  However, managers do need a new way of thinking about projects and need to learn new patterns of behavior.  Half or more of IT projects fail due to what the authors call \\"IT project disease.\\"  Symptoms of this \\"disease\\" include project abandonment, missed schedules, cost overruns, and delivery of less than what was expected. The authors offer a new view of this organizational affliction and present a philosophy and approach to cure it. <br /> <br />This new approach to IT project management is called the RITE approach. RITE stands for Revolutionizing IT Effectively.  This approach is an integrated collection of observations and principles which provide guidelines to those making decisions regarding IT projects. Some of the fundamental issues addressed by the RITE approach include:<br /> <br />How organizations should think about, organize, and carry out projects. <BR>Who should be accountable for the success of a project? <BR>What is reasonable to expect from a project.<BR>How project success should be defined. <BR>Why limits need to be set on the scope of the project. <BR> <br />You will notice that none of these issues relate solely to IT projects. That is the beauty of this book. Although the authors bring many decades of IT experience to the table, they have distilled principles that apply to any complex task or project.<br /> <br />It should be pointed out that the RITE approach is not a new methodology. It is not sufficient by itself to manage an IT project. As the authors state, \\"management principles do not take the place of good development practices.\\"  In fact, the RITE approach advocates adherence to a strong, disciplined methodology.  The book even briefly reviews the latest thinking in methodologies, including the \\"Agile\\" methodologies and Extreme Programming (XP).  However, the primary focus of the book is on a higher level of thinking which addresses attitudes, assumptions, approaches, and the organizational culture that creates the environment in which projects are managed.  \\"The culture of each organization includes its way of approaching problems and opportunities for improvement.  Too often that approach sets up projects for failure.\\"<br /> <br />This book provides a realistic approach for dealing with highly complex and unstructured projects by addressing issues such as scope control, accountability, the reuse of proven ideas, and the need for balance.  It also addresses the political realities of implementing the RITE approach. The book discusses how some will want to maintain the status quo, seeing that a change in philosophy and culture might threaten their power and prestige.<br /> <br />IT professionals are in the business of managing complex tasks and projects.  Considerable learning has taken place since the publication of the excellent book, The Mythical Man-Month, over 20 years ago.  David Andrews and Kenneth Johnson are true IT veterans, and distill their wealth of experience in this easily read book.   Although the title of the book might lead you to think it is a technical book written only for IT professionals, I suggest that the principles presented are universal and, if applied, can have a powerful impact on any organization.<br />(Review by Dr. J Howard Baker)	2004-02-16

Who Moved My Cheese? is a book which describes how to deal with change. Who Moved my Cheese? is a story about how two mice and two little men look for cheese in a maze. The cheese pictures what we want to have in life, whether it is a small income or a life of luxury.  The maze pictures where we spend our time looking for what we want.  Some people are content with what they have and resist change, while others are constantly looking for new opportunities. This entertaining little parable is a quick read which illustrates that sometimes we get too accustomed to our cheese being in a particular place and fail to notice when the supply gets smaller or is about to disappear. Then when we finally notice, we are often too frustrated to look for alternative sources of cheese, or else we eventually start looking while losing valuable time. As you read this book you will probably start relating the different characters in the book to people that you know, and how they react to change. Who Moved My Cheese? is not just for business professionals or organizations, but can be very helpful for everyday life.	2003-10-29

It is their contention that a business can continually improve the effectiveness of practically everything that is done. Their book is the result of current research and seeks to go beyond the stale concept of \\"here is what others are doing so go ahead and copy it\\".<br />A major goal of The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is to teach you how to improve your organization with a sound business model and how to use your creativity to continually improve that model. This can result in generating your own new growth opportunities rather than waiting for opportunities to be created by competitors or the marketplace. The authors offer the powerful concept of reinventing your business model to discover new outlooks that will increase stakeholder satisfaction and allegiance. Competition is not only with other competitive organizations but with your organization's present business model! <br />The Ultimate Competitive Advantage will help you evaluate your business plan from \\"stem to stern\\". Mitchell and Coles ask a number of challenging questions to focus your plan on the proper target and in the right direction. They seek to engage the reader's potential for imagination and prod the reader to ultimately look for new ways to promote growth. If fully appreciated, this book will direct you to some positive answers that are typically apparent but often overlooked.<br />This book is not simply a philosophical treatise on how to create a business plan or workable business model. It is laced with real life examples that will give you pause for reflection and personal evaluation. It is not your typical book on management or leadership. However, it does present some of the best practices of respected business leaders and stresses the importance of effective communications and relationships among all stakeholders. Examples include some of the most recognized and successful organizations onthe modern business landscape. <BR> <BR>The Ultimate Competitive Advantage is composed of four parts and broken down into nine chapters. Every chapter concludes with a series of \\"key questions\\" that are intended to spark the reader's inventiveness and vision. If you desire to read a book that will take you to the next level toward improving your business model, you have found it!	2003-10-29

In modern terms a narcissist is a vain, self-absorbed, arrogant individual with a grand sense of entitlement.  Narcissistic tendencies include the need to be perfect or in control at all times.<br />Narcissistic attitudes and behaviors are epidemic in our society.  The American Psychiatric Association estimates that one out of every one hundred persons meets the criteria of severe narcissism.<br />According to the author, \\"our culture is full of narcissistic influences that numb us to the reality of the problems we face.\\"  In fact, unreality is the hallmark of narcissism.  Their distortions of reality can cause others to question themselves and doubt their own perceptions.<br />Narcissists will go to great lengths to promote fantasies that sustain their grandiosity and omnipotence.  Many prominent elected officials, sports idols, and entertainment figures are narcissists.  They also head large corporations and lead flocks of the faithful.  Many of us encounter unhealthy narcissism in some form every day.<br />Narcissists see themselves as \\"special people.\\"  They know better than you do.  They are also very shame-sensitive.  They avoid shame at all costs.  They are unlikely to self-correct their intrusive or inconsiderate behavior just because you call attention to it.  When failures occur, they portray themselves as victims and blame others for their misfortune.  Gossip, backbiting, and bootlicking are prevalent in work environments dominated by a narcissist.<br />The narcissist sees power as his due.  This is why many achieve management positions.  In such positions they practice stretching employees until they break and then get rid of them.  This is called \\"rubber band management.\\"  Narcissists are also very aware of shifts in the balance of power.<br />In this book author Sandy Hotchkiss presents an excellent general description of narcissism and covers how to deal with the narcissists in our lives.  Knowing the narcissist's weaknesses and tendencies will help you effectively deal with narcissism.<br />Chapter 16 is titled \\"Narcissists at Work: The Abuse of Power.\\"  This chapter is well worth the price of the book.  It covers the narcissistic problems of poor interpersonal boundaries, scapegoating, shameless exploitation, envy in the workplace, and ways narcissists seduce us.  The chapter ends by providing four guidelines for survival with a narcissist in power.<br />If you find yourself working in a toxic environment headed by a narcissistic manager, you will want to read Why is it Always About YOU?.<br />Review By Dr. J.

Often leadership books are criticized for being \\"too theoretical\\" or \\"too soft\\" for the real world. This book is different. The principles and best practices presented are backed up with \\"hard\\" data obtained from the review of 3,000 studies.<BR> <BR>The ideas presented in this book can really make a difference to the bottom line. Applying these innovative ideas will yield productivity gains, improvement in employee morale, and increased profits. This leadership model departs from both the \\"top down\\" and \\"bottom up\\" models of leadership. It presents a third model which Dennis Romig calls \\"Side by Side\\" leadership. The Side by Side model recognizes that leadership is about building and sustaining effective relationships. \\"Leadership is facilitating Side by Side relationships in pursuit of shared goals.\\"<BR> <BR>Romig points out that often the most effective way for leaders to influence others is to \\"change their own behavior.\\" This is right in line with Stephen Covey's \\"inside out\\" approach to leadership and Bowen's Natural Systems Theory. The Side by Side model recognizes that leadership involves facilitating and coordinating a two-way influence process. Such leadership is mutual, interactive, and shared. <BR> <BR>In the top-down, authoritarian model of leadership influence is one-way. Top-down leaders usually listen only to a few others-mostly those in authority above them in the hierarchy. On the opposite side of the leadership spectrum are the bottom-up leaders who have allowed participative management practices and \\"democracy\\" in the work place to get completely out of hand. Dennis Romig presents a \\"third way\\" that is a higher way than either the top-down or bottom-up approach. <br />The Side by Side leadership model appears to be the closest of the three models to Robert Greenleaf's vision of Servant-Leadership.<BR> <BR>\\"Executives who spent their entire careers practicing autocratic leadership read Robert Greenleaf's Servant Leadership and did a complete turnaround. But they mistake Greenleaf and others like him. They went too far. The proponents of participative management never meant to advocate a one-way, bottom-up model...Neither top-down nor bottom-up has worked very well for us.\\"<BR> <BR>Dr. Romig presents five spheres of influence in Side by Side Leadership. These five spheres are:<BR>1. Personal<BR>2. Interpersonal<BR>3. Team<BR>4. Organizational<BR>5. Knowledge<br />Most of us are strong in one or two of these spheres, but naturally weaker in other spheres. For instance, you may excel at personal and knowledge leadership, but be weaker in interpersonal, organizational, and team leadership. This is an important concept. An organization needs leadership in all five spheres. It is unlikely that a single individual will excel in all five spheres of influence.<br />Dennis Romig identifies seven principles that are critical in all five spheres of influence. These principles include focused creativity and structured participation. Each of the five spheres of influence can be thought of as an assemblage of these seven principles. Finally, the author shows that it is important for a Side by Side leader to master twenty critical skills, such as two-way listening and living organizational values.<br />With five spheres of influence, seven principles, and twenty skills to master, this leadership model may seem overly complex. That is just the point. Too many authors have taken a simplistic approach to leadership.  Leadership is not simple! It is a complex system with many interrelated parts. However, Dr. Romig has done a superb job of integrating all these elements and relationships into his book, keeping references to research findings brief and to the point. He shows that there are many \\"entry points\\" into the Side by Side leadership model, and there are many different ways to be a successful leader. This is not a \\"one size fits all\\" kind of book!<BR> <BR>I want to thank Ray Bard at Bard Press for suggesting I review this book.  <br />I rarely get this excited over a book. Buy it! Read it. Get excited too!<BR> <BR>Review By Dr. J. Howard Baker	2003-10-29

It describes cultural leadership that produces a homogenous organization where work can be done collectively.  Seeing leadership in these terms is different from past models.  It has been an American tendency to see leadership in terms of the personality and capacity of individual leaders.<br />Leadership is the task of culture creation-of creating a culture of shared values, vision and trust where people know what to expect and participate in because it is what they want to do.  Leadership cannot take place in a culture where people distrust each other, doubt other's motives, and pursue independent action agendas.  Fairholm defines the leader's role in cultural creation, change, and maintenance as primarily a values creation activity.  Leaders use values to define meaning for the group.  He elaborates on team relationships and a cultural environment conducive to developing and using trust. <br />Three ideas form the basis of this book: (1) culture creation, (2) trust relationships, and (3) leadership.  Shaping a culture in which group members can trust each other enough to work together is the first leadership task.  Of all the new and pressing problems the chief officers in our large-scale organizations face day-to-day, one stands out.  It is the challenge of creating and maintaining an organizational culture that fits the nature of the work done and the character and capacities of its growingly diverse work force.<br />Fairholm affirms that cultures exist in every organization-even in groups that last for only a modestly short time.  The benefit of these cultures is that they provide methods of understanding events, symbols and messages.  The author takes the state of our societal culture and shows how this affects cultures within organizations.<br />Fairholm also deals with details of leader actions and requirements in shaping culture.  He defines cultural leadership as a function of values, plus strategic, communications, and office politics systems present in any organization.  He ties cultural leadership to the effectiveness of the action used, the attitudes engendered in members by cultural artifacts, the service goals established, how leaders manage change, and how one exercises leadership.  He focuses on how and by what means leaders create meaning within the organization.<br />Faiholm also introduces some elements constraining a fully trusting culture, including the quality of communication, the way a company assigns authority, and general feelings of apathy and alienation.  Development of a trust culture may also be hampered by a lack of effective accountability mechanisms and time constraints.<br />Trust is key to an effective organization.  Leaders within the organization are responsible for achieving a level of trust within the organization that is beneficial to all stakeholders.  In developing a trust culture, leaders make the work easier for everyone within the organization.	2003-10-29

Trust is a subject that has woefully been lacking in many past books on leadership and in some respected educational institutions that should have been teaching it. The result of this neglect is evident in the daily news, which has been reporting on the indictment or conviction of numerous business executives for corruption. Our jaded generation is skeptical of most positions of leadership for good reason. For too many, the importance of trust has been clouded by personal greed. Galford and Drapeau boldly discuss this subject with clarity, common sense and research. The authors wrote this book primarily for those in senior leadership roles, but its content is certainly applicable to most anyone.<br /> <br />This book is composed of fourteen chapters within five parts or themes. The parts are logically presented and include...<br /> <br />Part One: An Overview Of Trusted Leadership<br />Part Two: Identifying And Applying The Tools Of Trusted Leaders<br />Part Three: How Trusted Leaders Work<br />Part Four: Defining Moments<br />Part Five: Building Trust In Perspective<br /> <br />The Trusted Leader is a comprehensive discussion of trust beginning with the definition of trusted leadership and concluding with the importance of leaving a legacy of trust when you depart the organization. As the authors state, \\"we feel strongly that creating a community of trusted leaders who can then help trust permeate through all levels of an organization-particularly in today's business context-is critical to every company's long-term survival and success.\\"  <br /> <br />Galford and Drapeau have written this book using their own research, personal observations and case examples. They offer a series of interactive exercises to determine where trust can be supplemented and improved. In addition, they also offer some diagnostic tools to help the executive rebuild trust. A remarkable \\"Self-Assessment\\" tool presented in chapter 2 is one that you will want to revisit often! ...<br /> <br />As a credit to its authors, this book was envisioned and started before the Enron, Global Crossing, Adelphia Cable, Tyco and WorldCom scandals broke. It is timely and its message is long overdue. If you want to study a vital yet unfrequented area of leadership, The Trusted Leader is definitely a book you will want in your personal library.	2003-06-27

It is a natural sequel to Jim Clemmers previous excellent work, Growing the Distance. However, whereas Growing The Distance had a central theme of developing leadership from within, Clemmer's new book discusses valuable timeless principles for those who have the privilege of leading others within groups or organizations. The contents of this book are revealed in nine thoughtful chapters with themes including how leaders make a difference, leadership responsibility, possessing personal authenticity, the need for passion and commitment, and moving leadership into action. <br /> <br />Clemmer is a natural author and his writings are enjoyable to read. He uses an easy to appreciate philosophical approach to teach both basic and complex leadership principles. The Leader's Digest is a book gently seasoned with frequent quotations, classic fables, personal examples and Clemmers own \\"how-to\\" points.  The author does not simply reshuffle previously known leadership information into a new format. This book offers some strong originality and content. One example is the CLEMMER Group's Leadership Wheel presented in the first chapter. It is a \\"hub and spoke\\" model that shows how leadership begins at the core of our being and develops in many directions. Each part of the wheel reflects a different area of leadership and these areas are discussed in the succeeding chapters.<br /> <br />The Leader's Digest is a highly recommended book because it is rooted in the most powerful and truthful principle known by great leaders. As Clemmer comments, \\"leadership is an inside job. We change them by first changing me... leadership begins \\"in here\\" and moves \\"out there.\\" That calls for changing our lifestyle. It means developing new habits.\\"  <br /> <BR>If you understand the power that lies behind this remarkable principle, you will want to read The Leader's Digest.	2003-06-27

This book is part of the Everything® Series book collection. This collection is obviously a direct competitor to the innocuous yellow-covered &quot;For Dummies Series&quot;. To put it mildly, most would not consider any of these paperback books a serious reference in the educational world. However, The Everything Leadership Book does have some merits for a specific audience, and is proof you should not judge a book simply by its cover. <br /> <br />Adams covers a very broad perspective in regards to leadership in this publication. The twenty chapters deal with expansive and complex issues such as definitions, communication, motivation, coaching, power, organization/time management, change, employee hiring/management, volunteering and personal success. Like all books of this genre some of its answers and solutions are rather simplistic and too dogmatic. Yet, an important area of the book that needs more thoughtful discussion are ethics and values.<br /> <br />However, in spite of its obvious weaknesses, The Everything Leadership Book does have some strengths as a basic introduction to the world of leadership. It is well organized and easy to read. It has numerous leadership \\"Profiles\\" of individuals, leadership tips and \\"Words of the Wise\\" quotations. It incorporates the needs and attitudes of the growing number of independent, creative and self-reliant workers known as the New Workforce. Adams provides some interesting personal assessment tools. He also leads the reader to a number of helpful websites to learn more about volunteering opportunities and further leadership resources.<br /> <br />This is not the kind of book one wants to read in order to develop the serious skills or traits of a leader. However, if one is a novice or simply wants to learn the very basics of leadership, The Everything Leadership Book has a place. It has the ability to prompt the readerto want to learn more about this vital topic and does fill a niche for those who need or desire to begin their personal journey of leadership development at step one.	2003-06-27

The hallmark of this publication is the discussion of 21 common sense principles that apply to everyday leadership situations. John Maxwell has a ministerial background and has also started numerous organizations. This book is a reflection of his over 30-years of personal experiences, observation of great leaders and the qualities that set them apart from others. Some business consultants and academics have shied away from this book because of the religious background of Maxwell and the publisher. It is a sad loss because this is a book for everyone and is not a religious work. It is true that Maxwell regularly mentions his personal experience as a Protestant minister. However, except for one biblical reference, Maxwell skillfully mixes in numerous secular resources and examples like McDonalds, Lady Diana, GE/Jack Welch, Henry Ford and many others.  21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership offers straightforward principles that can apply to virtually everyone from a housewife to a Harvard graduate. <br /> <br />All of these principles or laws have been taught and discussed in previous books and by other authors.  Yet, Maxwell innovatively labels each law with some creative terms. For example, the \\"Law of the Lid\\" is another way of saying that one needs to constantly grow and expand their leadership qualities to go beyond their present personal limitations. This is true because your present leadership ability determines your level of effectiveness. Another quality that makes this book a delight to read is its energetic and uncomplicated style. However, a stylistic weakness appears in later portions of the book when Maxwell redundantly mentions his ministerial background experiences after they had been mentioned previously in the book. One thing is for sure, 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership is a joy to read with a practical message you can appreciate. You will only wish that Maxwell had spent a little more time emphasizing and reinforcing each law!	2003-02-23

Perhaps to use the title of \\"author\\" for The Best Advice Ever for Leaders is a slight overstatement. What Wess has done is to compile a book of over 800 quotes that he feels will help the reader to discover and develop the various traits of leadership. Many books of quotations have been written in the past. However, Wess has created one especially for leaders. Thoughtful, and some rather unique quotations are offered on various topics from accountability through worry.<br /> <br />The main purpose of the book is to examine the opinions of a vast array of leaders that transcend geography, cultural and historical boundaries. As the author states in his introduction, \\"The Best Advice Ever for Leaders takes this approach by collecting ideas from a vast range of leaders from virtually every walk of life, every part of the world, and every era of human history.\\" The goal of this book is to study leadership with an open mind, knowing that not every quotation is meaningful to every circumstance, place or time.<br /> <br />You will find quotations from individuals as diverse as Lao-tzu, Mark Twain, Lee Iacocca, Irving Berlin and George Washington. Special credit should also be given to Wess Roberts for providing footnotes after each quote to help us understand who the individual was, and a small segment about their life, so we can put their quotations in a balanced perspective. Most of these quotations are rare and seldom to be found in other publications. Here is an example under the topic of Disposition...<br /> <br />\\"Keep your fears to yourself, but share your courage with others.\\"<br />-Robert Louis Stevenson, 1850-1894, Scottish essayist, poet, <BR>and novelist.

Today it is used as a class textbook by some major universities in their management and leadership classes. Bolman & Deal encourage leaders to step back and re-examine the operation of their organization through the use of various frames or windows. These different lenses can bring organizational life into a different or clearer focus. They allow the leader to view the workplace from different images to make judgments, gather information and get things done. The authors label four windows and name them the structural, human resource, political and symbolic frames. The purpose of the book is to examine the elements and advantages of the four frames presented by Bolman & Deal. The end result is that we learn the importance of stepping back and looking at a situation from more than a single pane of glass. This is vitally important because most of us have the tendency to look at situations or problems from a limited narrow perspective, and this hinders our ability to be effective and visionary leaders.<br /> The Structural Frame attempts to look at the social context of work and not simply at the individual. Once an organization designates specific roles for employees, the next decision is to form or group them into working units. Coordination and control of these various groups are achieved either vertically or laterally. The best structure depends on the organization's environment, goals and strategies. Bolman & Deal list six assumptions behind the Structural Frame. 1) Organizations exist to achieve established goals and objectives. 2) Organizations work best when rationality prevails over personal preferences and external pressures. 3) Structures must be designed to fit organizational circumstances. 4) Organizations increase efficiency and enhance performance through specialization and division of labor. 5) Appropriate forms of coordination and control are essential to ensuring that individualsand units work together in the service of organizational goals. 6) Problems and performance gaps arise from structural deficiencies and can be remedied through restructuring.<BR> <BR>The Human Resource Frame is another window to bring an organization into a unique focus. It views an organization like a large extended family. From this perspective, an organization is inhabited by individuals. These individuals have needs, prejudices, feelings, limitations and skills. The goal of the leader is to mold the organization to meet the needs of its people. The leader will seek to merge the peoples' need to feel good about what they are doing with the ability to effectively get the job done. Bolman & Deal state that the key to this window is a \\"sensitive understanding of people and their symbiotic relationship with organizations.\\"<br />The Political Frame is a window that looks at the workplace as a jungle. This may not sound pretty but the reality is that \\"it is a jungle out there\\". It is a competitive environment or contest in which different people compete for power and limited resources. Reframing Organizations recognizes the work environment is one of rampant conflict immersed in negotiation, bargaining, compromise and coercion. Bolman & Deal offer five propositions as a summary of this frame. 1) Organizations are coalitions of various individuals and interest groups. 2) There are enduring differences among coalition members in values, beliefs, information, interests, and perceptions of reality. 3) Most important decisions involve the allocation of scarce resources and what gets done. 4) Scarce resources and enduring differences give conflict a central role in organizational dynamics and typically make power the most important resource. 5) Goals and decisions emerge from bargaining, negotiation, and jockeying for position among different stakeholders. Unfortunately, this is truly the business and social world most of us live in.<br />The Symbolic Frame is a powerful window that builds on cultural and social anthropology. It views organizations as carnivals, theaters or tribes. An organization is a unique culture driven by stories, ceremonies, rituals and heroes. This is in contrast to an organization being driven by rules, authority or policies. The organization is analogous to a theater. With this theater, various actors play their respective roles in the drama and the audience forms its own impressions of what is seen on the stage. The Symbolic Frame also looks at team building in a different light. It views the development of high-performing teams as a spiritual network also enhanced by rituals, ceremonies and myths. One does not need to look far to discover these symbols. They exist from the proverbial \\"corner office\\", to corporate seals, to the camaraderie of military units.<br />The four windows or frames presented by Bolman & Deal allow a leader to see events in new ways and to shift perspective. The use of the multiple frames can assist the leader to see and understand more broadly the problems and potential solutions available. It encourages the leader to think flexibly about their organization and opens various opportunities to the leader to view events from multiple angles. Reframing Organizations is the kind of book that forces you to view organizational life from a different viewpoint and new reality.	2002-12-16

They define leadership as qualities, traits and skills. Other authors approach the subject from an internal perspective. They define leadership as a reflection of what lies inside the heart of the leader. Author and consultant Kevin Cashman uses the later approach with great success and clarity. Leadership From The Inside Out reads like you are having a one-on-one discussion with the author over a fine meal. It speaks to the heart because it defines leadership as a \\"process, an intimate expression of who we are.\\" Cashman reminds us immediately that \\"we are the CEO's of our own lives\\" and we are on an ongoing journey to express and unravel our inner selves to make a positive impact within the world we live. <br />From beginning to end, Leadership From The Inside Out is intended to be a journey of self-discovery. In the first chapter Cashman begins to explore three essential questions to enhance our leadership effectiveness. He presents these as 1) How authentic are we as a leader? 2) How deep and broad is our self-expression? and 3) How much value are we creating? One of the major goals of the book is to help the reader to connect with their essential character, their central core in order to create effective leadership development. The end result is that the reader learns to no longer define their identity by the mere external results of their life, which are vulnerable, at risk and fragile.<br />To offer a new perspective on personal growth, Leadership From The Inside Out strategically leads the reader down seven \\"pathways\\" to discover the mastery of leadership from within. These pathways are articulated as personal mastery, purpose mastery, change mastery, interpersonal mastery, being mastery, balance mastery and action mastery. Cashman and his associates, LeaderSource, have developed these pathways as the \\"distilled insights from working with hundreds of leaders\\". Leadership From The Inside Out also encourages the reader to establish a leadership journal and offers numerous quotations throughout the text to provide additional insight.<br />This is a book that holds the promise to change you from within! At weLEAD, we have read hundreds of books on the subject of leadership from every possible perspective. However, if you are looking for a book that offers positive insight, encouragement and the real potential to gain a significant leadership transformation, Leadership From The Inside Out is it!	2002-11-11

He is an author, professor, inventor, electrical engineer, musician and the 10th president of the University of Southern California. His book entitled The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership is different and challenges many commonly accepted perceptions about leadership. A contrarian leader is simply one who thinks and acts differently than most. For example, the contrarian leader is one who thinks \\"gray\\" and \\"free\\". Thinking gray means to withhold judgments and decisions until you have heard all the relevant facts or until you are forced to do so. Sample spends a fair amount of discussion on the three major pitfalls of binary traditional thinking. He defines thinking \\"free\\" as the ability to first allow your mind to contemplate truly outrageous ideas, and only later on, apply the restraints of practicality, legality, cost, ethics and time upon your creative ideas. This philosophy of thinking gray also affects the decision-making elements of the contrarian leader. Sample makes two suggestions regarding decisions. First, that a leader never makes a decision that can be reasonably delegated to a lieutenant. Second, never make a decision today that can be reasonably delayed until tomorrow.  <br />However, the contrarian leader must have other needs and qualities aside from thinking processes and decision-making. These are also discussed in The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership. The author discusses diverse subjects such as artful listening skills, open communication, and the proper role between consultants, experts and the leader. Sample suggests prodigious amount of selective reading, including \\"supertexts\\" for the contrarian leader. This includes an extensive discussion on Machiavelli. He provides guidance on how to determine which range of the daily news and printed media are really useful for the contrarian leader. The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership<br />addresses the difference between good leadership and effective leadership, including the need to make tough moral decisions at the right time. Other discussions include hiring the right people, diversity, connecting with followers and having a title of leadership verses doing leadership.<br />This is a thought provoking and alternative book on leadership from the perspective of someone who leads a massive educational institution on a daily basis. You may not agree with every concept or idea regarding a contrarian leader, but you will find this book to offer some fresh perspectives.	2002-11-11

It is not about celebrity, fame or vainglory. It is about the \\"small and obscure\\" actions done by ordinary people who make the world work. Badaracco has written this book after four years of research and discovery that the quiet leaders are those whose patience, restraint and modesty are in a great part responsible for impressive achievements. He defines \\"leading quietly\\" as those individuals who maintain a low profile, and inconspicuously do what is right for themselves and their organizations without fatalities. <br /> <br />Badaracco uses case studies throughout the book to highlight his major points. He also includes special insights from a moral leadership class he teaches at the Harvard Business School. The literature he refers to from this class is particularly perceptive in contrast to the moral bankruptcy we have been reading about in the business pages of our daily newspapers! <br /> <br />Here are some of the qualities and guidelines possessed by those who are Leading Quietly:<br /> <br />Good leaders are those who are honest with themselves about how well they truly understand a situation and how much control they really possess. They don't kid themselves or deny reality. Effective leaders learn to trust their mixed motives. They accept their motives to be confused and mixed, and they use this ambiguity to solve problems or create compromises. Successful leaders often play games or create stall tactics to gain enough time to ponder difficult situations and think things through. They understand the value of buying a little time when necessary. Wise leaders build \\"political capital\\" and use it wisely. They cautiously borrow on this capital when proceeding in an uncertain environment or situation. Quiet leaders gather the details of complex problems. They take the time to \\"drill down\\" through the quagmire of bureaucratic, legal or technical detailsto discover a good solution. The quiet leader also seeks creative compromises as a responsible and practical goal of the responsible leader.<br /> <br />This is a book that celebrates the old-fashioned values of hard work and wisdom. Badaracco writes, \\"Preparation, caution, care and attention to detail are usually the best approach to everyday challenges.\\" The only major weakness of the book is its lack of emphasis on proper ethics. Leading Quietly offers a careful analysis of those unsung leaders who truly make the world work for all of us.	2002-07-20

Unlike many books written strictly for business, this publication is alive with style, relevant quotations, humorous quips and interesting fonts. Whereas beauty is only skin deep, this book has helpful and attractive information from cover to cover. Author Jim Clemmer is the founder and president of The CLEMMER Group, a strategic consulting firm. Jim is a best selling author, workshop/retreat leader, and keynote speaker on organization improvement, leadership development, and personal effectiveness. Clemmer presents the values and philosophy he models to others in this fine book.<br />One of the main messages that clearly jumps out at the reader is this powerful theme...leadership and change is a living philosophy that must permeate every aspect of life including family, career, personal responsibility and self-fulfillment. Many business books on leadership put the various life roles of a leader in separate boxes. Business is one box, family life is another box, personal goals and self-actualization in yet another box. It is often assumed that these various roles have little to do with each other and for this reason family life and spirituality are typically ignored. &quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is not afraid to challenge this misconception by boldly discussing a leader's various interconnected roles!<br />&quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is a book about creating positive change within yourself rather than being the victim of change. Its powerful premise is that we can begin from where we are today, and choose where we want to be tomorrow. By making these choices we can grow the distance. Clemmer believes that each of us can develop the qualities of leadership that reside inside us no matter what our position in life. This publication discusses what leadership is, why change is essential, and the importance of vision, values and purpose. Clemmer encourages personal accountability for our choices and writes how we can learn and grow from disappointments. He encourages us to find commitment and passion in our workplace, as well as in spirit, and meaning within our lives. He proceeds to discuss growth and personal development while reminding us that great leaders are able to energize others to motivate themselves. <br />If you want to read a book and be enthusiastic about your leadership potential, &quot;Growing the Distance&quot; is a must. It will inspire you and help to mesh together the various roles and activities of your life. This book is truly different and will find a happy home on your bookshelf!	2002-06-10

Author Paul Thorton has a direct way of getting right to the core of an issue (without the fluff). Composed of 14 short chapters and 120 pages long, you may be able to read this publication in one or two sittings.  <br />Thornton uses his years of consulting and workshop experience to get to the \\"nitty-gritty\\" of leadership basics. After a brief introduction he begins a \\"step by step\\" guide to better leadership awareness. Chapter 1 deals with a sound leadership foundation, which includes mission, vision and values. In chapter 2 he introduces what he calls the \\"Three C's of Leadership\\" which are the three things leaders should do! These are 1) they challenge people; 2) build people's confidence and 3) they coach people. With this early foundation entrenched within the book, the following chapters begin to build the core message.<br />The rest of The Triangles of Management and Leadership discuss management styles, the Power Triangle, planning, decision-making, managing conflict, motivation, feedback, controls, the Finance Triangle, dealing with difficult people and managing change. The author likes to use 3's to connect major points or concepts as in the 3-points of a triangle. Each chapter is followed by a section called, \\"Applying the Concept\\" in which other organizational leaders comment on the major principles of the preceding chapter.<br />If you are new to the subject of leadership, or like to read information in an easy to read style, The Triangles of Management and Leadership is a valuable resource.

When you finish reading this book and the depth of knowledge presented by its authors, you will agree that it is first among equals. Often times books written by two authors come across as disjointed or unconnected. However, McKenna & Maister seem to complement each other's skills very well and the end result is clearly evident.<br />FIRST AMONG EQUALS was written to fill a large need in most modern organizations. Its premise is how to manage a group and lead them to peak performance without possessing formal authority. Today, it is common to be leader of a group of individuals without possessing any real power or authority over the embers of the group. Wise leaders also know that even if they do have formal authority over others, the high performance leader doesn't act like they do. Instead, the way to get the most out of the individuals we serve with is to be primus inter pares, the first among equals. The authors then boldly take you step by step through an enlightened process of how to interact with and manage groups as an individual group leader. McKenna & Maister state in the introduction that, This is a book about \\"doing.\\" It is not concerned primarily with theories, concepts, or insights. It's a book we wish we had read when we were first given the challenge of leading a group!\\" This is achieved by providing frank observations, stirring questions, and wise advice from two respected consultants. FIRST AMONG EQUALS is also replete with quizzes, sidebars and checklists to enhance your personal growth as a group leader. <br />Part one of the book deals with the issue of how to prepare or \\"get ready\\" for your role as a group leader. It discusses how you add value to the group as its leader, and your rights and responsibilities within this important role. It discusses how you can build valuable relationships with other members and examine your essential people skills. It also deals with the question of what it means to be an inspirational leader.<br />Part two is a section dedicated to help you to learn to be a superior personal coach. It shows you how to get others to accept your guidance. Why unscheduled, informal \\"one-on-one\\" coaching is the most powerful way to improve a group's success. It deals with issues of building support for change, helping the underperformers who need assistance and dealing with the proverbial \\"prima donnas\\" or difficult people.<br />Part three of FIRST AMONG EQUALS moves on to the skills needed to coach the team. This part of the book deals with diverse team leadership topics such as developing group rules & goals, building trust among members, presenting an exciting challenge and how to energize group gatherings with good meeting discipline. This part of the book concludes with a discussion of how to resolve interpersonal conflicts and how to respond to a group crisis!<br />Part Four of the book looks to the future and how to prepare for it. It will show you how to nurture the next generation of junior staff and insure the success of newly hired personnel. It also discusses problems associated with group size, and how to properly measure the groups' success. The final chapter in the book entitled \\"Why Bother\\" concludes with a summery of the various lists provided throughout the text grouped by category in an effort to help you implement and synthesize much of the material. <br />If you are involved with managing or leading groups you should buy this book! No matter what level of experience or expertise you possess, FIRST AMONG EQUALS is a winner and is guaranteed to broaden your perspective on leading your group to peak performance.	2002-03-29

Rosenbluth &amp; Peters begin by dogmatically proclaiming that \\"companies not only can positively influence lives, they have an obligation to do so.\\" Both Rosenbluth and Peters have been closely associated with Rosenbluth International. This organization has been a world leader in travel management. Anyone familiar with the digital economy knows that travel management has recently undergone a revolution in how it conducts business and generates revenue.<br /> <br />The authors define the type of company we would all like to work for! A company built on friendship and where everyone genuinely cares about each other. Does this sound too good to be true? Apparently not, as this book demonstrates how fifteen of the worlds best companies have confronted the most severe management challenges and prevailed. In contrast to the prevalent management technique of operating \\"lean and mean\\", Good Company demonstrates the opposite approach.  Rosenbluth and Peters offer solutions on how an organization can discard outdated practices and create an environment of innovation, teamwork, continuous learning and joy at work. Chapter six of the book is entitled, \\"We're Not Born into Leadership: We Convert\\". It is here the authors define a valuable principle by stating that \\"Companies can't bestow leadership upon people; true leadership is earned with right attitude, skills, and behavior.\\"<br /> <br />The cultural foundation of the books corporate examples is most refreshing. It is that the pathway to competitive success is paved by investing first and foremost in your people. The authors show how any size organization can gain a competitive edge by accepting greater responsibility for society at large and the welfare of their employees. Organizations specifically mentioned include Land's End, Hallmark Cards, Mary Kay Inc., Southwest Airlines and over a dozen others.	2002-02-12

A number of his previous works explored the reaches of transformational management, including his bestselling book The Empowered Manager. In an even bolder way, Stewardship - Choosing Service over Self-Interest offers a dynamic new organizational structure for our young century. Block defines stewardship as \\"the means of achieving fundamental change in the way we govern our institutions.\\" He believes that stewardship is a choice \\"to preside over the orderly distribution of power.\\" This means giving individuals at the bottom of the organizational structure the choice on how to best serve their customers, citizens and community\\". It also means accepting accountability at all levels. Block continues to define stewardship as being accountable to the larger organization by \\"operating in service, rather than in control, of those around us.\\" His philosophy is centered on a need and commitment to service rather than self-interest.<br /> <br />Peter Block challenges the modern notion of strong leadership and suggests replacing the term with stewardship. His problem with leadership is that he does not believe it has the capability to create fundamental changes in our organizations. He also believes that leadership \\"inevitably becomes self-congratulatory and over-controlling. We expect leaders to choose service over self-interest, but it seems the choice is rarely made.\\" Perhaps Block would have better made his point by discussing the various philosophies that pass as leadership rather than neatly collecting them all in one term. Indeed, leadership is often a vague and misunderstood term.<br /> <br />Stewardship - Choosing Service over Self-Interest is a book with three parts. The first part discusses the basic concept of stewardship. It highlights the promises offered by developing a passion toward stewardship in contrast to what we experience in traditionally managed organizations. The second part of the book discusses the redistribution of power in a practical way. This controversial section of the book butchers many managerial \\"sacred cows\\" and offers a vision of what stewardship can be like in action! Part three examines the reform process and explores how you and your organization can get from where it is today to an environment of stewardship.<br /> <br />If you are one who is not satisfied with the status quo, you will find this book exciting and refreshing. Sometimes written in almost theological terms, Block inspires the reader to expect more from our institutions and ourselves. This book should find itself on the bookshelf of every person interested in the study of leadership.	2002-02-12

In the introduction to the book he states plainly \\"The leader most needs followers\\". He goes on to explain that in reality followers \\"have a say\\" in what they are led toward! The theme of Certain Trumpets is that a successful leader doesn't just trumpet or sound their own certain message, but instead they sound a specific call to others capable of following. He believes that leaders need to understand their followers more than followers need to understand them! What is Garry Wills basic definition of a leader? \\"One who mobilizes others toward a goal shared by the leader and followers\\". In other words, coercion of others is not leadership, it is just power.<br /> <br />With this introduction in mind the rest of the book consists of Wills discussion of individuals who have possessed leadership in various ways. The author believes that different leaders should be considered notable because of their own goals rather than their personalities, which is the most common perspective. As a result of this perspective, Wills does not treat leadership as a single thing, but mentions sixteen various kinds of leadership within the book. He also goes on to discuss various subdivisions within the sixteen kind's. Certain Trumpets attempts to define these distinctive types of leadership by using examples that range from Franklin Roosevelt (Electoral Leadership) to Dorothy Day (Saintly Leadership). To make this exploration interesting, and to provoke thought, he also provides an antitype character in contrast to each distinctive type of leader presented. It is Wills hope to exemplify the individual's characteristics by providing this contrast. Wills doesn't think we lack leaders today, but sufficient followers. He refers to this as the \\"real problem with leadership\\". Certain Trumpets is easy to read, stimulating and creative enough to look at leadership from a different lens.	2002-02-12

Yukl uses his expertise and credibility to write an outstanding book focusing on managerial leadership rather than social or parliamentary leadership. He attempts to include information on both the theory and practice of leadership in modern organizations. This valuable text also includes many recommendations and guidelines for improving the effectiveness of managers and leaders. The book includes a number of cases in an attempt to help the reader understand real world organizational problems and applications. This is a book that is primarily written and mostly reads like a college text book and is indeed used by a number of universities in their managerial or leadership programs. However, it is easy to read and does an excellent job of including the most informative and relative literature, studies and theories available today. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the study of organizational leadership, leading teams, leading change or studying follower-based approaches toward leadership.	2002-02-12

His book is a refreshing approach to leadership in many ways. Stylistically and philosophically, Leading Change is a different kind of book about leaders and the natural resistance of the change process. O'Toole left a comfortable 20 year university chair in academia to begin working with the Aspen Institute. This experience was a major inspiration in writing this enterprising book.<br /> <br />Perhaps the most daring aspect of Leading Change is O'Toole's clear repudiation of the contingency theories so prevalent today in leadership research and coaching programs. He obviously did not come to this conclusion frivolously. This work includes his observations and experience from over two decades of working with both corporate leaders and with respected mentors such as Bennis, Drucker, Gardner, DePree and others! O'Toole loudly proclaims that the contingency theories so revered today simply don't work in the long run. He maintains that by their very design they typically destroy trust between leaders and followers. He then offers a values-based alternative, which is a primary focus of the book.<br /> <br />Leading Change begins with O'Toole drawing a number of deep analogies from a painting by James Ensor. He immediately draws you into the books theme by probing a number of profound leadership questions and scenarios analogous to paintings theme. As an author, he seeks to answer three related questions:<br /> <br />1.                  What are the major causes of resistance to change?<br />2.                  How can leaders effectively and morally overcome that resistance?<br />3.                  Why is the dominant philosophy of leadership, based on contingency theory, neither an effective nor a moral guide for people who wish to lead change?<br /> <br />To answer these questions O'Toole divides the book into two halves. The first half deals with leaders and the second half with followers. The main theme of his work is to seriously question the validity of contingency theory and propose the alternative of value-based leadership behavior. O'Toole writes, \\"Instead, values-based leadership is an attitude about people, philosophy, and process. To overcome the resistance to change, one must be willing, for starters, to change oneself. In essence, then, values-based leadership is \\"unnatural.\\"\\"<br /> <br />If you want to read and digest a book that will challenge both you and much present thinking about leadership, this book is definitely for you!	2002-02-12

It is founded on an approach that leaders must first or concurrently deal with the &quot;mindset&quot; or spirit of their people as well as changing processes or structures. Without positively dealing with attitudes and thinking styles among the organization all efforts of changing structures, systems or processes will meet great resistance and potential failure. <br /> <br />They formally define Enlightened Leadership as &quot;the willingness and ability to draw the vision from their people and inspire and empower those people to do what it takes to bring the vision into reality. Indeed, Enlightened Leaders nurture and encourage their people to be open, creative, and innovative and find what it takes to achieve their shared objectives.&quot; This type of leadership gets the &quot;members of the organization to accept ownership for that vision as their own, thus developing the commitment to carry it through to completion.&quot;<br /> <br />Much of the book is devoted to asking thought provoking questions in the authors hope that the reader can discover their own answers to an enhanced leadership approach. Much of the content in the book is a result of their personal experience working with their own clients and using their own observations. It is obviously full of valid and helpful information presented in an interesting and easy to read style.	2002-02-12

Sarah McGinty is an expert in the field of linguistics and her book offers us the opportunity to improve our patterns of speech to become a linguistic leader. She breaks down speech patterns into two basic modes of communication. These modes are referred to as \\"Language from the Center\\" and \\"Language from the Edge\\". The first of these conveys the pattern that is typically associated with leadership including knowledge, trust and authority. The later mode conveys responsiveness and collaboration.<br /><br />\\"Language from the Center\\" is authoritative and tends to direct the flow of conversation. It makes statements, argues, and leads the listeners to where the speaker wants them to go. It also conveys competence, knowledge and a feeling of trust in the speaker by the nature of the confidence expressed. This mode also tends to use facts and strong analogies to make a point and demonstrate their expertise.<br /><br />\\"Language from the Edge\\" is responsive rather than directive. It tends to ask questions, avoid argumentation and explore others' opinions. It explores, brings others into the conversation and seeks to gather information, to learn and listen instead of direct. In this mode objections may come in the form of a question rather than a bold statement. Some careers require this mode of communication including teachers, therapists, and counselors. In these professions communication is first gathered and secondarily is expressed with expertise when their opinion is needed.<br /><br />The purpose of Power Talk goes far beyond the definition of these speech patterns. McGinty clearly shows how one can combine both modes into an effective unified communication style. By cross-training these linguistic modes a speaker is now able to immediately draw the positive aspects of both. The author believes that different situations require different communication styles and adapting the right language for the given situation will lead to greater success. The result is a linguistic toolbox referred to as power talk. However, this is not an easy task. It requires the speaker to examine himself or herself internally and discover how we sound to others. One must become aware of their own speech patterns and the speech patterns of others.  Then by practice, sampling and observation the speaker can increase the effectiveness of their communication. McGinty explains how this process can work and she maintains that power talk can improve communication skills leading to greater influence and career advancement.will lead to greater success.

Between the covers of this entertaining book Kevin and Jackie Freiberg have captured the essence of the \\"Southwest Spirit\\" that has made Southwest Airlines one of the top companies in America.  Although Southwest served over 90 million bags of peanuts in 1999, there is nothing \\"nuts\\" about the way they run their company. Southwest topped the list of Fortune magazine's Best Companies To Work For in 1998, and since then has been in one of the top four slots every year. <br /> <br />This book is a must read for anyone who wants to see how the concepts of servant leadership are actually put into practice in a real company of over 30,000 employees. You will learn about a company that practices the golden rule as corporate policy-and has paid quarterly dividends for 97 consecutive quarters doing it! The \\"Southwest culture\\" described at length in the book gives this company its strategic advantage. This culture genuinely cares about the welfare of the Southwest employees-which are approximately 82% unionized. Southwest Airlines has turned a profit every year since 1973, yet it maintains the lowest fares in a highly competitive industry. It is one of the most admired airlines in the world, regularly ranks best in customer service, and has a consistently high safety record. Southwest was the first airline to establish a home page on the Internet, and was named by BusinessWeek as a \\"Web Smart 50\\" company.<br /> <br />Some of the book's statistics about the airline are now out of date due to incredible growth. More recent statistics are readily available at Southwest's web site . However, the principles discussed in this book that are used to guide this most admired airline are timeless.<br />Review by Dr. J. Howard Baker	2002-02-12

If you are familiar with the previous works of these two authors you will know they intended it to be dramatically different. They succeeded well with Freedom and Accountability at Work. Peter Block starts this journey by writing the introduction. His task is to create a context by which his colleague's writings can be used to understand the dynamics of the modern workplace. Many of the concepts and ideas found in Freedom and Accountability at Work are taken from two previous books written by Koestenbaum. Both The Vitality of Death and The New Image of the Person were written by Koestenbaum in the `70s. These two philosophical books are at the heart of this new publication. This book is written on the premise that it is time to bring philosophy into the world of business by helping others find answers to their questions about the real purpose of work. It includes ways to bring ethical and spiritual values into the workplace.<br /> <br />Block encapsulates this thought when he writes, \\"Philosophy is really about a universal form of leadership and the possibility open to each person to shape or create an environment that supports the pursuit of meaning and purpose, rather than our current obsession with financial security and material wealth.\\" Freedom and Accountability at Work provides discerning and near tangible ideas about anxiety, freedom, suffering and death. The authors maintain that viewing the purpose of work from the lens of a philosopher can provide a unique shift in mental perception. They believe that by rising above the mental traps that typically ensnare us, we can make our work places more humane and experience the accountability and real freedom we all want. The authors also provide potential solutions to those whose are presently struggling with personal suffering and depression. They encourage the reader to engage in this profound degree of change that will help one to overcome the cynicismthat comes from superficial change. It is their contention that leaders need to ask these deeper philosophical questions to become better role models today and to acquire the enabling vision to lead tomorrow.	2002-02-12

Contributors include Charles Handy, James O'Toole, Thomas Stewart, Tom Peters, Barry Posner and James Kouzes. These essays were first presented at a special conference held to honor Warren Bennis. Organizers labeled the conference a festschrift, a German word for a volume of essays assembled by colleagues to be a tribute to a renowned scholar. The essays were edited and divided into five parts:<br /><br />1.  Setting the Stage for the Future.<br />2.  The Organization of the Future<br />3.  The Leader of the Future.<br />4.  How Leaders Stay on Top of Their Game.<br />5.  Insights from Young Leaders.<br /><br />The result is an insightful examination on the state of leadership today and the challenges it can expect to experience in the future. For example, Bennis writes the first essay and presents a number of challenging issues, including the widening disparity of talent among income levels, growing demographic changes between young and old and balancing the demands of work and home. James O'Toole looks at the organization of the future and remarks that leaders should view their tasks \\"as creating the systems under which others would be encouraged to do all the things that typically end up on the desk of the do-it-all leader.\\"<br /><br />The Future of Leadership is a comprehensive examination of leadership today and tomorrow provided by a number of insightful modern day thinkers. It asks some judicious questions and dares to look into the future with assurance and confidence. Some essays are better written than others, but every reader will find some valuable material and learn a new perspective from its pages.	2002-02-12

How many times have you heard them dogmatically emphasize the importance of modeling the right example? How many times did they offer concrete statistical proof to support their statements? Author David Maister doesn't just talk about it...he proves it! The heart of Practice What You Preach is the result of an extensive worldwide survey Maister conducted in 139 offices throughout 15 countries in 15 types of businesses. Seventy-four questions were asked along with an analysis of financial information. Maister also conducted extensive interviews with the organizations managers and workers. In analyzing the top 20% of the most financially successful companies, he came to the conclusion that the behavior of managers played a large and powerful role. The survey demonstrates that employee attitudes are directly linked to financial success. Good managers effectively listened, demonstrated values, were trustworthy, good coaches, communicated well, treated others with respect and practiced what they preach! Maister also encourages managers to inspire their team by demonstrating and modeling the values they proclaim to others. <br /> <br />Practice What You Preach is interesting reading and sure to keep you engaged. Maister has a way of getting straight to the point with concise comments and points throughout the entire book. For those who desire to dissect the survey data, it is published at the end of the book in the appendices. Like pieces of a puzzle, Practice What You Preach reveals the results of the survey one point at a time and interweaves major lessons to be learned from a number of case studies. Building from the simplest analysis and lesson to the most complex, the impact of the book is cumulative. Maister also provides an excellent summary in the later portion of the book.<br /> <br />Rarely does an author of Maister's caliber offer personal detailed data to support his conclusions along with relevant case studies. Perhaps David Maister sums it up best when he passionately mentions that the \\"story is richer\\" than simply reading the chapters which discuss the main conclusions. He continues, \\"I hope that most readers will come with me as I recreate the journey of discovery that this research took me on.\\"  <BR> <BR>It's a journey well worth taking and it will enrich your understanding of effective management and leadership.<br />...	2002-02-12

Covey and vice president of Franklin Covey Company. If you appreciate Dr. Covey's books including Principle-Centered Leadership or The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, you will want this book! Blaine Lee discusses what he terms the power principle, which has the potential to significantly impact all of our relationships in and out of the workplace.<br /> <br />In a nutshell this power principle is defined as learning to influence with honor. Dr. Lee begins the book by discussing the relationship between power and influence. Most societies and cultures use two fundamental power strategies to influence others and achieve efficiency. The first power strategy is one of forced coercion. People do things because they are afraid not to. The person in authority has the \\"ability to intimidate or bully people, to do something unpleasant or uncomfortable to other people.\\" The second option is that of a fair exchange approach. People do what they are told because of what the person in authority can do for them. They offer their services because \\"I will pay you if you'll do what I want. I have something to exchange for your time and effort...I've got something you want, you've got something I want. Let's make a deal.\\" Blaine explains how these two approaches may be efficient but long-term they are not effective or productive.<br /> <br />The Power Principle offers a third approach to power strategy. It is predicated on a number of core principles clearly discussed by Dr. Lee. This is a different kind of power since it \\"suggests that the person you believe is powerful is someone others believe in, someone they honor, someone they respect.\\" When others honor you, you have the ability to have sustained, long-term influence with them. The second 2/3rds of the book discusses why the power principle makes a difference, what they are, and how to use this strategy with your family, customers and coworkers. The final chapters deal with making a commitment to change and the power principle a lifelong quest.<br /> <br />This is an outstanding work and makes an excellent companion to Dr. Covey's highly respected principle-centered philosophy.	2002-02-12

Imagine for a brief moment that you are a farmer, and when you look outside all you see for many miles are Green Fields.  Imagine further that the land is fertile, and that there is an abundance of water. There are no rocks to clear, no trees to fell, just rich fertile land ready for planting of any crop you choose! By applying the Greenfields Approach to business, Denis Orme believes you can envision your potential business and personal opportunities in the same way, without constraint. By doing this, many new opportunities will arise and existing ones will appear different.<br /><br />The Greenfields Approach is unique and based on a straightforward principle. Too much of the planning and thinking we do is incremental and becomes self-limiting. Too much energy is spent in piece meal planning, benchmarking and strategies. This leads to false assumptions and self-imposed constraints. Denis Orme defines the Greensfields Approach by asking two questions. \\"If you were starting the business or business unit tomorrow, would you do business the same way?\\" Secondly, \\"If you were embarking on a career as a recent graduate, would you launch or grow your career the same way?\\" He then replies, \\"If you would not do things the same way, then why are you doing it that way now?\\"<br /><br />Lessons From Leadership Failures-The Greenfields Approach has seven chapters and 63 modules. It is a virtual handbook outlining actual leadership failures, the lessons to be learned from these failures and how the reader can do it differently. As Denis Orme candidly writes in the introduction, \\"This book is about leadership mistakes in each key area of business and the lessons learned from mistakes made by other senior executives and myself.\\" For example, Chapter 5 is entitled Flavor of the Month. In this chapter, Orme cautions against consultants or technologies that attract the latest fad or buzzword to solve problems rather than cost-effective solutions.<br /><br />Lessons From Leadership Failures-The Greenfields Approach is truly different in approach and purpose. It is not simply another text on leadership, but a serious analysis of past business failures, lessons to be learned and how to do it differently.	2002-02-12
