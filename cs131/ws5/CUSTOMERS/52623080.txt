A fine introduction to these places of serenity, mysticism, and inexplicable vibes.  Author does not get preachy or weird.  Some areas full of how-to-get-there details (Sedona's vortices, eg) but some areas give only general info (Indonesia's Borobudur). <br /> <br />	2005-07-07

Then you'll love this beautifully written and lovingly researched book about the history of Classics Illustrated.      Jones manages to evoke the characters of the men and women who contributed to this fascinating niche of Americana: illustrators, editors, publishers, and even its detractors. Interviews were obviously thorough, chapters are meticulously footnoted, and yet it reads like ...well, like an engrossing classic tale of adventure!  Pick a chapter at random or read from cover-to-cover... it's consistently a winner.     While occasionally too ready with a disavowal of nostalgia, Jones does not hesitate to reveal his personal lifelong love of the comic book series.  Truly, the best works of fandom itself can be so endearing, so contagious with admiration and awe.  This book is no exception.  Like myself, Jones loved the comics when he was a kid. Just as publisher Albert Kanter intended, as an adult I've managed to read every word of the real Count of Montecristo and War of the Worlds and The Moonstone, but I first learned these vivid and amazing tales by reading the Classics versions.  Jones augments my personal appreciation and gratitude in this excellent book.      His work was in-depth and, while certainly using a critic's eye, relatively even-handed when it comes to the series' contributors.  Now, reading the book, Jones has even made me appreciate the work of Classics artists whose pages I'd previously disliked.      Excellent illustrations, particularly of rare pages and covers, fill the book.  Nice personal photos of the artists and editors are a great touch, seeing as this is a book of both down-to-earth and scholarly sensibilities.      Only fault I can find is that the text sometimes refers to a page or panel or other artwork which is not actually reprinted in the book.  It can be maddening, at times, because we want to see exactly what he's talking about.  My family's incomplete collection lies in another continent, otherwise it would be nice to have it at hand for referencing these things.  Keep yours at hand.  The book, I suppose, would be gargantuan if Jones did include these bits.  So, by rights, it is an excellent book, and I did enjoy reading it.	2005-07-07

So incredibly powerful is the simple text, it is hard to be unmoved in the reading.  For me to hear the illustrator himself give a reading of the book, while my dearest relative was in the clutches of incurable cancer, was almost too much.  For this reason, this is NOT a pick-up-and-read-any-old-time kind of book.    <br /> <br />To be sure, there are going to be times when this book is extremely valuable.  If a child is suppressing his emotions over a loved one's passing, perhaps this book could be the perfect ice-breaker.   <br /> <br />But if the parent feels that his or her child needs to deal with death from another angle besides loss, it might be best to find a book that expresses other philosophical views on death.	2005-06-27

At times, text could seem a bit embarassing and truly degrading of women, but Fielding puts in enough humanity and tenderness to avert a real disaster. <br /> <br />This sequel has a little less for self-deprecating readers to humorously identify with, simply because Bridget has become almost a caricature of her silly but truly satirical debut.  I don't want to spoil the bizarre twists and turns of vol 2, so I'll say no more about those.  <br /> <br />Cetainly plenty to laugh at, so those readers who were wild about the first novel should still find enjoyment in this one.  It's got the now-familiar humor addressing diet, overindulgence, dress and makeup disasters, career advancement strategies, and list-making.   <br /> <br />Movie treatment of this novel rather different from the text!	2005-06-19

Threads of humanity, heroism, sacrifice, grace and virtue run through the book without making it melodramatic.   <br /> <br />It's never preachy, but the whole text is a good example of how truths are revealed by getting all the facts in one place and the narrative in order.   <br /> <br />I am not really interested in mountain climbing, and anything else I've read about Everest is not memorable; but Krakauer made the subject absolutely fascinating to me. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good adventure story.  Would probably appeal to people who have an appetite for true mysteries and even forensic nonfiction. <br /> <br />	2005-06-19

I can certainly see why some readers wouldn't be able to deal with his style and opinions, but I must say that this volume might be a pretty good litmus test of readers' tolerance for the author's travel works.  (If you can enjoy this one, you'll probably enjoy his other non-fiction works). <br /> <br />I, for one, totally enjoyed hearing about grunge-y has-been towns, obnoxious holiday camps, and seedy hotels.  To me, the book was a real page-turner, and he writes so vividly of scenery.  I felt he wrote about the worst bits of his trip with true humor, reminding us travelers that it's helpful to keep a sense of humor during the rough times.   <br /> <br />I felt the book was a pretty decent scouting report for the island's shoreline, and I now know what to avoid there.  I can definitely thank Theroux and his fussy standards!   <br /> <br />If you like Theroux, it's a good bet you'll love this one. <br /> <br />	2005-06-19

Here, he's written about his stint as a cab driver in Aspen, but the engrossing part is his own ability to crash celebrity-only functions. <br /> <br />It's an interesting study in the interaction of haves and have-nots, for the rich and pampered of this famed snow town NEED the hardworking waiters and drivers and maids and ski instructors and yet are often bizarrely detached from the realities of working a steady job.  Conover finds ways of crossing into the world of the haves, without ever forgetting who he is. <br /> <br />Conover doesn't show real envy for the rich and famous, but he enjoyed their parties.  He's a downhill skiier and cyclist, so he certainly enjoyed the outdoorsy life there and treats a venture into a star studded party as just another nature hike worth detailing.  Conover shows a kind of pity, in fact, in a brilliant little section about hanging out in a bar booth with Mick Fleetwood and friends.   <br /> <br />Who you'll meet in the vignettes and tales of Conover's observations of Aspen life: the plethora of fine-looking young ladies, the unreal mansions with their no-holds-barred parties, the spoiled nouveau riche corporate wives, movie stars and rock stars, the crotchety old guard of the small town, drunks and granola eaters, skiers and commuters from the working class lowland. <br /> <br />It's not a gossip-fest, nor is it a boring social critique.  But it's a real slice of life.  And you get a little local history and politics, too.  It's a fine book for anyone who is fascinated by how the other half lives. <br /> <br />The author's own mobility, personable nature, and mutability are his true assets. He seemed to walk away from Aspen satisfied and with a desire to explore other realms.  Which he does, again and again, in his brilliant books. <br /> <br />Good gift for a ski bum, for a social climber, for anyone who admires the art of schmoozing and faking it.  Could be a bit too depressing for someone who lost in an attempt to get rich and join the upper crust.    <br /> <br />	2005-06-13

That brilliant cartoon series is loaded with adult humor.  But many of those same cautious parents would read to their kids this series of creepy books.  Just because some crafty marketing person at Harper compared them to Harry Potter. <br /> <br />Note: I wouldn't mind knowing what J K Rowlings thinks of Lemony Snicket's work. <br /> <br />People who want their kids to hear tales of adventure and of triumph over adversity, can go to any number of classic children's books.  What sets apart diverse classics such as A Wrinkle in Time and Rapunzel, from the likes of A Series of Unfortunate Events, is the uplifting magic of wrongs truly righted, and of puzzles terminatedly solved.   <br /> <br />The series in review simply offer no hope at all to the reader.  At every bend in the road, Snicket (I'd hide behind a pseudonym, too, if I were the creator of these books) invokes woe and hopelessness.  It can drive you batty, all the too-bad-we-weren't-there-to-warn-them's.  It's just a downer, all the way, as unrelentingly awful as the Chuckie series of horror movies. (Child's Play, I believe, is the series... and let us not forget what part that evil-can't-be-overcome movie played in the horrific murder enacted by two young boys in the UK last decade). <br /> <br />I can see that there are a few kids who liked the books and have reported as much at this site.  But I would imagine they are of a certain age (not sure which age, exactly) and certain fortitude.  That doesn't mean these books are appropriate for most kids.  Why take the chance of depressing your kids, when there's so much great adventure to be enjoyed in other books?   <br /> <br />I still have the books lyingaround... think I'll move 'em over towards the fireplace.	2005-04-04

But don't do this at the airport the day of the flight.  Diet must be altered three days in advance of travel.  <br />My family and I have been using this for 15 years, and we swear by it.  The only time it hasn't worked for me is when I've tried to cheat the system (watched an in-flight movie when the book said I was supposed to be sleeping, that sort of thing).<br />Unfortunately, most airlines do all they can to keep passengers stuck in their departure time zone (ensuring days of jet lag for all), but this book shows how necessary it is to board the plane and get right into the arrival time zone.  It does take a sense of discipline to follow the program while in flight. In general the flight is not particularly enjoyable if you're following the program and are therefore out of sync with all the other passengers, BUT if you are a business traveler or don't have the luxury of wasting several days, you will find that the short-lived discomfort is insignificant!  <br />A highly useful book for the international business traveler... would make a nice gift for someone going off on a round-the-world or other long flight.  (But give it well in advance of the travel)!	2004-06-16

Of course, the fact that 2 gigs in the same province can be a day's drive apart, makes Bidini's collection ever the more fascinating.  <br />I simply could not put the thing down.

This was a time when it was de rigeur to visit the Ubud home of Walter Spies, influential composer, stylisto, and painter.  It was also during the artistic reign of Balinese dancer extraordinaire Mario, and, depending on the edition of this book, there are lovely b &amp; w photos of Mario performing his signature dance.  <br />In this text, Balinese culture is so well observed that the book is hardly outdated, rarely misinformed, and always an engrossing read.<br />Probably the first book to which western expatriates turn for pleasure and cultural education; and among the best books for a visitor's enrichment of his/her visit to Bali.  Generally considered a classic travelog.	2004-01-07

Generally centers on films of the 70's and 80's.<br />Title implies that the films critiqued in the book are rare or little known, but actually I would say it is possible that half are available at any large video rental place, nearly all available through mail order.  What this book does is introduce reader to about 100 films that are worth watching for various reasons, according to an interestingly varied assortment of film critics.<br />This is actually a product of the National Society of Film Critics.  Contributors include Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert, Terence Rafferty and Judith Crist... Not shabby at all!  Plus almost everything is written with more a sense of appreciation and enthusiasm than overwrought intellectual analysis.<br />Editor Sragow was definitely among the top two or three critics ever staffed by the San Francisco Chronicle.  His contributions to the book are reviews of All Night Long, Southern Comfort, and the generally underrated Blow Out, the latter being a rare glimpse of Brian DePalma as a director concerned with issues of ethics and integrity, with an excellent performance by John Travolta.  So that's the sort of thing the book offers, namely praise for unusual treatments and underappreciated performances.<br />Only shaky part is that the average reader may not already be familiar with the tastes of any of the critics, and may find an unexpected disagreement with one of the critics over a film or two.  I can't say that this book has managed to isolate a hundred films that are absolutely incredible, and the whole world will agree.  But there are way more gems than slag in this collection, and the writing is generally very good.<br />For the average DVD or video renter, this book could be the perfect consciousness-raiser.  After reading a few of the reviews (which each average only 2 or 3 pages), the reader will probably find a title he or she MUST now view.

The one-liners get tiresome in a hurry, seem almost scripted.  Nothing wrong with the writing except that there's simply NO THREAD or THEME.<br />There was certainly some good material to work from; it's not like they stayed on the beaten path... they really ventured into some interesting places, but author could not make the trip account engrossing.  Lots of missing info like how they came to be chaparoned by such an intriguing array of resourceful men.  Irksome organization of the narrative due to these lapses in personal details.<br />As travelogs go, this one's among the worst.  I wanted SO much to like it (Indonesia's my favorite archipelago &amp; I am a female who loves to travel), but it just doesn't measure up.  In retelling one's travels, a writer must either educate or entertain or entice readers... this book does none of that.   There's little more than: this happened, then we had to go to this place, and here's a funny story about the airplane ride being cancelled, and then we saw this... and so on, like your Aunt Sadie's slide show monologue of Florida.  There's little traction, no sense of anticipation, of curiosity for what might happen next.  Makes me appreciate the consistently acerbic Paul Theroux, the critical wit of Bill Bryson, and the sharp eye of Jan Morris, the world's best travel writers.<br />Truly a shame, considering both women seemed to like the journey and she went to the trouble of writing a book about it.	2003-09-24

If you use this book to remodel or build, you'll be making some informed choices!<br />Ignore the hairstyles of the models (mid 1970's) and book won't seem so dated.  In fact, Europe (source of most of these designs) must have been ahead of America in the bathroom design game, because most of the fixtures seem quite current, actually.<br />Bedroom sections of the book are more dated, though, with a lack of variety, especially with conspicuous absence of shabby chic, country, and ethnic styles which have become popular in America.<br />What is really great about this book is its organization.  There are informative and entertaining sections about the history of, say, the bidet or the cradle.  There are sections for the design of sickrooms, rooms for convalescing, rooms for couples, rooms for teens, and so on.  <br />Great variety...Many excellent, helpful examples and diagrams! More photos and examples than most currently available design books of the same size.  <br />Goes one step more technical/practical than usual style books, in that there is a whole section on choosing a mattress, one on toilet seat ergonomics, one on the manufacture of carpets.  <BR> <BR>One last complaint... photos often feature poorly lit interiors.  The technology in that area has definitely improved.  But it's still an excellent supplement to a homeowner/remodeler/interior designer's collection of style books.	2003-09-11

I say, read it if you don't know a thing about comic book history, but it's not good enough for the old guard.<br />True: it's an engrossing epic that touches on roots of popular comic book culture, especially superheroes.  Any comic book fan will totally enjoy the format, which is oriented to the origins of the art itself.  Protagonist serves as a metaphor for the golden age of comics, going from refugee escape artist to unsung war hero to battered & bruised survivor of postwar politics.  If you treasure, say, the story of Bruce (the Batman) Wayne witnessing the brutal slaying of his parents, the vow to fight crime, you at least have one reason to try reading this book.<br />BUT<br />Many flaws are due to making sweeping broad brushstrokes about origins of comic art, and there are annoyingly erroneous glamorous bits, too.  While truly Surrealism and cinema have their influences in comic book art, Chabon places New York comic book artists in an intellectual avant garde milieu and doesn't give enough credit to the more boring commercial art & advertising world that was a kind of spawning ground of many of the best artists.  This book is not a factual history, Chabon's proud account of research notwithstanding.<br />As prose alone, there are several nice touches.  Chapters of the Antarctic war posting of protagonist are wonderful, engrossing.  <br />Bafflingly bad is account of nice if arty Jewish girl in bed with lover, nonchalant as her dad walks in.  1940s?  No way, no how!  Book is dotted with these embarassments.<br />Frankly, I just hope that the book wins more hearts for the art of the comic book.  It may be doing that.  It's a fine introduction, a novelty to the as-yet-unconverted.  What the heck, all this hooplah helps raise the value of our collections!

I found it engrossing at times.<br />Auster recounts his youthful rejection of middle class consumerism, his odd and fascinating encounters with all kinds of characters and life situations, his stay in Paris, his first marriage, his ...well... failures to make it big as a writer.  His admirable sense of integrity (no jobs except ones literary) unfortunately kept the author wallowing in translation work to put food on the table, and the sense of pain, desperation and even a sort of starvation are palpable.  Agonizingly, but rather fittingly, he tells only of his years BEFORE success.  This is no rags to fame & riches story.<br />Hand to Mouth is basically a reality check.  Of some value to anyone who wants to get published, but the only thing that keeps this from being totally depressing is our knowledge of Auster's eventual literary success.  <br />Lovely sections about the wacky people he met on ships and on streets reveal inspiration for characters he brings alive in his humanistic fiction.  <br />If you do buy an edition (check out the number of pages before you order) which contains \\"Action Baseball\\" and \\"Squeeze Play\\", you are in for a treat.  The former is a complete card game and the latter is a detective novel.  Squeeze Play was written under a pseudonym and features a Jewish private eye with a law degree from Columbia who has a taste for fine wine and music.

Certainly offers western readers valuable insight into Balinese culture.  Great for a visitor or even an armchair traveler, but is pretty much de rigeur reading amongst expatriates in Bali and the rest of Indonesia.<br />Reader sees Ingram making the jump from long-term backpacking visitor to full-on expat, a transition that many have made, albeit with great culture shock.  Ingram and his wife make the compromises and changes with admirable patience and refreshing good humor.  Lesser mortals can find a welcome bit of comfort in this text.  Never condescending (neither towards the Balinese nor towards bumbling westerners), this series of stories are told with a gentle, smiling tone.  Not exactly a page-turner, but delightful and bright.<br />The author and his wife have gone on to found a truly marvelous charitable concern which is contributing to the rebirth of textile weavers and dyers in the Indonesian archepelago.  Their warm attitude toward the people of Indonesia lives on in this work.  When visiting Bali, do not miss a visit to Jean's gallery in Ubud, named Threads of Life.	2003-08-24

But this will get you the basics. <br />Bonus delight is the first entry, a mood-setting piece on one man's contemplation of mountains and forests... all to be found in his tiny Japanese garden.  <br />Grab a copy and use it and love your results!	2003-08-23

It could be a nice introduction to tropical plants, but anyone who wants to actually garden with tropical specimens would be better served by other books, perhaps best of all, Gardening in the Tropics, ISBN: 0881923095 .<br />As one reviewer points out, there are several silly mistakes.  It is telling that the publisher is known for style &amp; design books.  It needed an editor with a little more botanical savvy. <br />The format is clear and attractive, with huge photos and a little, nicely written text for each.  The content is somewhat inconsistent.  While many photographs are clear and nicely illustrative of the whole plant, some specimens are photographed in a massive mixed border some distance away.  Identification, therefore, can be very frustrating.  For every delight (there are, indeed, many gorgeous photos), there is a disappointment.  <br />Nomenclature seemed inconsistent, and local names (Indonesia, Malaysia, etc) could have been supplied by these contributors who spend much of their time in southeast Asia.    <br />There is no practical advice for a gardener (beyond the occasional note about something tolerating dry conditions or some such), but book doesn't pretend to be a guide book.	2003-08-23

Readers from either group (and in between) will find value in this enjoyable handbook.  <br />In a friendly tone, albeit occasionally repetitive, Otteson offers real, valuable, practical advice (how to bargain, what to pack, how to deal with bribery, etc).  Some of this stuff you'll find tucked away in Lonely Planet guidebooks, but Otteson's editorial sense makes his advice easier to find, and it applies globally. Backpacker networks abound with &quot;how to's&quot; for various scenarios.  It can be overwhelming.  But Otteson has gleaned the gentlest, most useful, and most intelligent tips.<br />The newest concept Otteson brings to the table is HOW to make a journey.  This was very useful to me.  He gets the reader to really think about what is important... do you want destinations only (sleep on trains as you go?) or do you want to get a feel for the whole of a region, and travel only in daylight hours (what he calls threading).  You may opt for a combination of the two styles, but he makes an excellent argument for the latter.  <br />Within the pages are wonderful glimmers of enthusiasm for travel itself; reader will be bitten by the travel bug... So if you are not really sure you should get off your duff or if you are trying to convince a homebody to join you on a trip, this book will whet the appetite for the adventure of the open road. <br />Now, more than ever, does the world need to see the face of the American traveler.	2003-08-23

The later book has a version of this with ingredients altered, not as wonderful.<br />Nothing in this book is truly fast, but everything is fabulous.  Braden feels that if you can prepare certain things in advance (and she always details these for the reader), the cook's final assembly IS fast, so I can forgive this misleading title.  Everything is organized into seasonal menus, with ideas for table presentation, type of party, &amp; many useful suggestions on recipe variations.  Perhaps it is this down-to-earth attitude about playing around with a dish which makes each recipe so interesting and fun.<br />I particularly like the way that many menus contain recipes which are not necessarily rich, caloric, and fussy.  There are plenty of recipes that call for simple, fresh ingredients.  That said, Braden definitely includes a number of recipes which are indeed very decadent, elaborate, and labor-intensive, with hard-to-find ingredients for all but those living in proximity to urban gourmet outlets.  On balance, you can find herein either fuss or no-fuss recipes, and there always seems to be a way of simplifying a recipe.  Also, Braden sometimes suggests ways of dealing creatively with a leftover.<br />There's a real enthusiasm in the whole setup of the book, which helps any cook immensely.  Great skill is never necessary, and the recipes are clear and nearly fool-proof.  Most joyful cookbook I've ever used!	2003-01-14

Readers get to laugh at the ridiculous yearnings and whines of a pitiful but somehow loveable nebbish, right? But Ames is apparently writing truthfully about his own sexual guilt, perversions, and fantasies.  Quite remarkable that the writer can spin details of his unsavory problems with very taut, humorous prose.  The result is, reader ends up rooting for the poor sap.<br />It's all here: sex with a transsexual, his Oedipus complex, tales of his pal the exhibitionist, prostitutes, getting the crabs, you name it.  Reader just doesn't know what to expect next, but Ames always manages to top each story with the next.  Perhaps just as much could be said for average reader's appetite for the bizarre and perverse.  I would guess that Ames knows all too well what sells, and he's just happy to oblige.  Food for thought, but meanwhile, just go ahead and laugh your way through.<br />Remarkably candid accounts and perfectly crafted humor make it impossible to dismiss him as a creepy pervert.  Good old human frailty and honesty seem to prevail.	2003-01-14

Therefore, the section on cacti and succulents is a bit scant.  And I wished for a little more variety in palms.  What nearly makes up for this is the completeness of all the other categories... shrubs, flowering plants, foliage plants, water plants, so on.  Amazing detail is given for each plant and, often, its variations.  Holtum can always be relied upon to comment on, say, a plant's success at high altitude or near the sea.  <br />Lots of suggestions for how a plant should be used in relation to other species or what size garden it requires.  But no landscaping sketches... this is all imparted through the text and sometimes photos.  With each listing, the reader will be able to learn rates of growth, most appropriate methods of propagation, etc.  Photos excellent but not always inserted RIGHT next to the appropriate text, and sometimes a plant is listed/written about in more than one place (without any good note to this fact).  All in all, though, it's a useful reference book without extraneous chit chat.  <br />Bonus for Indonesia and Malaysia: along with plants' common English name and Latin name, we get the Malay name (usually same as Indonesian).  Extremely useful for dealing with local suppliers.<br />I have been very happy with this huge and generally well organized book.  None of the gorgeous looking Periplus or smaller tropical plant books come close to the usefulness of this book.	2003-01-14

How fortunate to be able, in one's golden years, to look back with such wonder, sympathy, and good humor.<br />This short but powerful work absolutly enchanted this reader.  The chapters are sometimes confessional, sometimes an homage to a person long gone, and always full of wonder and spirit.<br />She writes of interior settings, relationships, prophesies, family (a loving one), and cities (London during the blitz, for example).  Her descriptions are never labored or complex, but details resonate in her simple yet expertly chosen words. <br />It is not so much that poet Denise Levertov has lived an extraordinary life (well, she did), but what makes this utterly magical book come alive is her ability to capture in prose her complex feelings about events and people of her childhood and early adulthood. As such, it validates the idea that we are all sensitive and deep.  That is, she has a way of newly expressing feelings that we have all had but probably were never able to put into words.<br />Simply, I have never seen an autobiographical work that so powerfully expresses fervent sentiment, love, and emotion.  Never shallow, always fresh.  A remarkable work.<br />Excellent gift for your own mother.	2002-09-11

Very good coverage of each featured home; excellent organization on the page, with text in English, French, German.<br />What sets this book apart is its tremendous variety of taste, environment, ideas, style.  Locations really run the gamut; the book is divided into continents, so Africa (for example) gets just as much attention as does Asia. The scope is fabulous: non-chic locations like a rustic cottage on the Baltic Sea, a windswept beach house on the English Channel.   The north African featured homes are especially interesting.  So there is a beautiful array of styles and ideas on how to highlight a special environment.<br />Not a source book (no index or listings of architects and products), but an excellent style book.  The photos are first-rate, with beautiful balance of detail shots and whole rooms.  Quite a lot of landscaping can be seen, even if it's about &quot;interiors&quot;, so that's a bonus.<br />Need not be decorating a seaside home to be able to love and even use this book.	2002-09-04

That'll appeal to those of us crazy enough to create our dream house.  Whether a person builds with straw, wood, or bricks, he or she earns membership in the dubiously grand brotherhood of homebuilders.  Fellow members: you will recognise your project in this book; you'll laugh, groan and perhaps sob, along with the author, whose slightly dry, self-deprecating humor buoyed her in times of good and bad.      <br />Secondly, the book focuses on the author's cultural clashes with the Balinese.  She is never condescending, never patronizing, &amp; refreshingly never glorifying towards the Balinese.  Little by little, through trial and error, Louise and her husband learn about how to communicate with, how to get along with, and how to employ these unique people.  Expatriate westerners living in Bali will see themselves in the foibles and complications arising in the author's interactions with the Balinese.<br />Thirdly, it's a great little taste of Balinese culture, circa 1935.  If you're going to Bali, or have been to Bali, or you just like the IDEA of Bali, you'll find much to appreciate in the intimate, non-travelogue descriptions by this author/artist.<BR>A delight.	2002-08-29

Because the reader is confronted with the words of real people, the book becomes a very personal experience.  Some of the combat tales are as horrific as any from the war in Viet Nam.  Likewise, the bureaucratic nonsense, the prejudice, the loss of life, the cruelty, the simple acts of heroism and sacrifice.  Enormously poignant at times; often humorous, sometimes devastatingly sad, always gripping.  <br />I am not much of a history buff, and perhaps this is the best level of historical writing for me, so I would recommend this to anyone who has even the slightest interest in what Americans were doing during that war.	2002-08-18

(Actually, you may easily garner a few great ideas for that adult Halloween party)!<br />Crack it open on the sofa with the children gathered 'round.

Lucky for the reader, many if not all of these stories work with the theme of how a person does change.  Again and again, we see that she is remarkably good at constructing the feelings and thoughts of adolescents, and this reviewer suspects it is partly because Lively has indelible memories of her own amazing childhood; read also her Oleander, Jacaranda autobiographical work, hinted at in the marvelous short story about an English girl returning from a childhood in colonial India.<br />Lively is purely talented as a wordsmith, with amazing economy and clever, rather elegantly composed dialogue.  The book is excellent from start to finish.	2002-08-18

I kept going back to it, giving it a fifteenth or sixteenth chance, only to abandon it quickly, in favor of truly brilliant Penelope Lively or even merely skilled Rosamunde Pilcher (other mature, contemporary British female novelists).<br />The dialogue in the Camomile Lawn is nearly always unrealistic, the characters cartoonish, and the atmosphere / setting overly fussed over.  In prewar Britain, the embarassingly good, upper class protagonists go on and on about their simpathy with the Jews (so politically correct now, simply not such an important part of upper crust 1930's Anglo Saxon sensibility), the sexy lovers dish out measured amounts of sauce and swear words... it's just an embarassing mess of an attempt to be raw and real.<br />I never got past the first hundred pages, and I will not seek out Wesley's other works.  I really wasted my time, rolling around in a little bit more than just camomile blossoms.	2002-08-18

His writing sometimes feels labored and overwrought, with overlong sentences or ungainly descriptions.  But his consistant style, sense of justice, and biting wit are the gems to be discovered within.    <br />The earliest stories seemed to have a lack of balance between darkness and wit, but he did find his equilibrium and most of the later tales are deliciously satisfying.  <br />Absolutely delightful reading if you liked Robert Altman's recent film Gosford Park, or if you are fed up with stuffy, mean upper class types.	2002-08-18

Moves quickly, full of style and moments of brilliance.  Probably one of the better novels about what it means to be hip, late sixties fashion.<br />McInerney has always liked creating parallel plots and metaphors in his writing; he does it best in this novel: Civil War, North and South, hip and square, gay and straight, black and white are explored in this very enjoyable if not exactly flawless novel.<br />McInerney is uneven in his conveyance of the language and taste of the hip, circa 60's and 70's: sometimes brilliant (descriptions of haute hippie home decor) sometimes bad (makes one character say \\"cut to the chase\\", a late 80's phrase, in the early 70's).  But even when a character or some dialogue doesn't ring true, his writing certainly leads the reader into realms that do.	2002-08-15

It's not just food that makes this book so engaging.  It's the travel tales, the glimpses of humanity, the quite perfect humor writing.  Bourdain's account of riding shotgun in a Vietnamese sedan manages to top P. J. O'Rourke's side-splitting rules of third world driving.  I think I laughed out loud during A Cook's Tour more than any other book, ever!  <br />Only downside is Bourdain's overly elaborated love of hashish &amp; tobacco, but the main thrust of this book is the author's world tour of eating for a cable food channel; he manages to infuse more humor into these chapters than there are calories in a Baked Alaska. <br />It's a truly hilarious read.

Despite the fact that the author clearly admires and reveres these intelligent and adventurous women, the book disappoints on a couple of fronts.  The writing (nearly half a century old) is peppered with somewhat embarassing colonial language about native beauty, genetically determined intelligence, and primitive sexiness.  No blatant racism here, but plenty of indulgent speculation that comes off poorly today.<br />I found it annoying that the author used French liberally but without any attempt at translation; this usually appears in quotations and with a disclaimer that the flavor of the original language would be lost in any translation.  I disagree: a skilled translator could handle it beautifully.<br />I personally enjoyed these accounts of the lives of women who ventured beyond the realm of other western women, who supported great men, or who even changed the course of history.  But I felt I had received only part of the stories.  I have yet to find more writings about these women, but I am sure they are out there.  A very entertaining introduction to each subject's life.	2002-08-02

It's a side-splitting tale that succeeds brilliantly when read aloud. <br />There are many wonderful tidbits in this collection (by some acclaimed writers), a few odd losers, but on balance this is a great book to infuse a little humor into the ever-unpredictable realm of travel.<br />Absolutely first rate as a travel companion.

The reader can zero in on an image and immediately see the relevant text.  This is a highly practical format, leaving no mystery as to whether some place or item may be of real interest to the individual reader.  Therefore, reader can figure out what he/she wants to see & do without slogging through chapter upon chapter of text.<br />I spend a lot of time in Bali and I think this is probably the most useful guide for the average traveler to Bali & Lombok.

We never found anything to disagree with on their reviews, although they called our pensione \\"cheerless\\" despite the sunny south exposures that were a delight.     Best of all, the maps are cross-referenced to the text, so when reader looks up a restaurant review, the map location is noted and easily found (other guide books are infuriatingly lax in this simple and useful method).

Many authors means varied levels of expertise, so while the Barcelona section pointed us to some good, non-touristic restaurants, the Italy section was appalling.<br />Example: The only restaurants Florence has to offer the independant traveller, per this guide, are a handful of places with Japanese on the menu (dead give-away locals aren't wasting their lira there), overpriced... I was glad to have my Europe by the Back Door with me, or I'd never have found the good authentic places in my brief stay there.  In Rome, the restaurant choices are simply glossed over (oh, they do get specific about where to find McDonalds).  <br />Simply, the guide just wasn't enough for our five country, six week stay. Was so glad for the other guides I brought along.  A waste &amp; a shame.

There is even a sort of aristocracy amongst the working class people whom Fussell generally refers to as proles.  Fussell's sharp eye has found and catalogued an amazing array of signs that indicate class in America.  Try to spot these signs at your next social gathering, or even subject your own living room to the survey at the end of the book (frighteningly accurate way to determine one's class)! <br />This is a book based on pigeon-holing people, and that is probably what most annoyed readers can't stand about Fussell.   But class distinctions do exist, like 'em or not.  The middle class hope to rise in class by sending their kids to Harvard or Yale, the Proles hope to do the same by getting more money.  Lucky &quot;X Class&quot; people don't give a hoot about such climbing, and fortunately more of us are just veering sideways into that final category which Fussell charts as a kind of class alternative.  <br />Actually, the book could also be a helpful guide to those with a need to temporarily masquerade as a member of a given class... Unfortunate but true that you will get better service at a jeweler's or other tony shop if you dress not so much &quot;up&quot; but into the highest class you can accurately manage.  And if you want to blend in at the truck stop, there are plenty of hot tips to be gleaned from this book.  <br />Yes, yes, we should best judge each other only by virtues like honesty and willingness to help, but the book is about class, that dazzling (and now not so mysterious) thing.  <br />Not without the odd mistake (I argue that books piled around the living room are not so much a sign of the upper class as an intellect), it is an excellent, juicy little book that will make you either laugh or curse at Fussell and his incisive wit.	2001-07-09

Author is British journalist James Cameron (the man who heard the famous words of a Gandhi staffer, to the effect that it costs a fortune to keep Gandhiji in his simple lifestyle).<br />This short but meaty book is a loving portrait of a marvelous country.  Cameron uses the incident of a horrific car accident he suffered in Bangladesh to tie together his own sense of mortality and India's great endurance.  <br />Pace can be a little rough at times, but that is the only detraction from this beautiful, appreciative look at India and its foibles, humanity, grace, sufferings.  His treatment of conversations (with little hints of well-observed Indglish) are a joy to read.  Many tender and thoughtful passages about mankind, but it's really a very personal memoir of Cameron's ongoing yet troubled love affair with a nation.<br />Indispensible part of any India-phile's library, great pre-departure (or take-along) reading for anyone going there.	2001-06-05

Most of the ingredients are readily available in developed nations, but even in the States, fresh herbs and other nice ingredients called for can be rather expensive.<br />The &quot;fast&quot; part comes from Braden's very well-organized suggestions for advance prep work and even freezing of components.  There are no shortcuts, as this really is cooking from scratch, so don't expect to whip up any of her menus in an hour before sitting down to eat.  You really do have to love the act of cooking to love this book, but you sure don't have to be a pro to do the recipes well. <br />These menus are thoughtfully composed, delicious, and very impressive to your guests.  I use some recipes over and over again, and have adapted a couple for everyday meals.  <br />The food really is fabulous, and she has many, many suggestions for how to vary the recipes, deal creatively with the leftovers, and make presentation beautiful.  Worthwhile investment.	2001-05-09

Because so many of the problems between college students and their parents could be easily handled or even avoided if parents always had a good solid communication line with their kids.  From Day One!  Simply, every parent lets go of their kid eventually, and it is sobering to consider that, 'round college time, you are either letting go of a friend or a stranger.<br />What makes this is an extremely useful guide is the authors' obvious close knowledge of and experience with almost every kind of pitfall a student can drop into.  Parents are indeed given a thorough rundown of what they can expect to see happen.  IN AMAZING DETAIL!  <br />Students about to enter college are well-advised to read the chapter called &quot;The Freshman Year.&quot;  It is an excellent examination of what's very possibly in store, will prepare the student for some of the challenges faced by all Freshmen.  The nervous 'newbie' may find some real solace in knowing that (s)he is not alone in her/his anxieties and uncertainties. <br />The authors' drugs warnings are a bit too complacent for my sense of health and self-discipline, meaning that there is an annoying hint of &quot;well, that's what kids do in college.&quot;  But I also took that as a helpful bit of data, because now I know that college administrators and professionals simply don't care if your kid is on drugs, until it escalates into an enormous problem.  That in itself helps me as a parent, because I see the limitations of the average administration's care.  <br />Another annoying facet to the book is a pervading sense that all professors are right, or at least unquestionable (authors definitely side with academic authority).  Frankly, there are a large number of professors preaching utter garbage or who have no desire to really see their students actually learn something concrete.  This possibility is never suggested, whereas I would firmly state that there are some students who are bright and capable who would never &quot;make it&quot; in a college environment.  Dropping out is mentioned only once &amp; only as a kind of last resort of degradation and shame.  The possibility that a class or professor may be totally wrong for a student is glossed over.     <br />I would suggest to editor/publisher that the index be improved and lengthened in any later edition.<br />So despite the flaws that linger like mist, I still recommend the book as a collection of scenarios and phenomena the parent would not necessarily have anticipated.  Read the book, talk to your kids, let go gently.<br />Definitely prepares the parent for what college life can be all about, and offers some ideas for how friction and conflict can be avoided. Liberal use of student, teacher, dean, and parent statements (however edited they may be) ring true and make this a wonderful, and even, at times, a heartwarmingly humorous read.	2001-05-02

Excellent for parents and students alike.<br />Amazingly covers all bases with a good deal of common sense, with excellent format.  Chapter summaries allow for quickly scanning the meatiest data, and there are checklists and logical outlines for sane planning.<br />It's almost certainly not the ONLY book you'll need, but it's really the best concise guide to start off on the college hunt/financial aid search/SAT battle/admissions process.<br />Perfect for student without access to a college guidance counsellor, who may not know where to start... this would be an excellent gift to the family with a child who has just started high school, but it can still be very useful in the late stages of the admissions process.	2001-05-02

That's all it is... a guide.  Tries to be your &quot;insider&quot; pal but fails on several fronts.  China's too darn big and changing too fast for any publisher to dare think a single &quot;China&quot; volume is sufficient.  I mean, would you trust a single &quot;USA&quot; guidebook?  Of course not, even if it's as thick as a phone book (and this ungainly little brick is just that).<br />Many wonderful sights/attractions/wonders are not even mentioned... Did editor decide to excise them, or do researchers look only so far??  I, for one, would have liked to see more attractions mentioned.  But if the LP people are going to keep up the chatty little comments with every such entry (a Lonely Planet hallmark), they will have to break up &quot;China&quot; into many volumes.  For example, book does not even show on Wuhan map the fascinating, large Taoist temple there... cutting the chit-chat about Mao's Villa there (worth visiting but the text on it is useless) could have made room.  But if they want to keep the cute comments (surfing buddhas on a temple wall in Kunming, overrated herbalist in Lijiang, Europe in miniature in Chengdu), they are going to have to break the book up into at least three volumes.<br />Restaurant reviews could be chopped in half, that's for sure.  They are boring, outdated, sometimes wholly erroneous.  Phone numbers have always been a joke in LP editions for any country I have used ...I own some seventeen LP's... but these numbers were wholly useless to me on my recent trip.<br />As other reviewers note, it is necessary to concede that China is always changing, and with growing speed.  Perhaps LP just can't send their researchers out fast enough.  But there are enough expats living in Chinese cities to be tapped for updates.  Incidentally, expats are a great resource for any traveller... already Shanghai and Beijing have weekly &quot;what's on&quot; style tabloids in English that are very helpful to the visitor.  Anyway, on the expat account alone, generally clever LP editors really have little excuse for not having a finger on China's latest and greatest.<br />What's good about Lonely Planet China??  Liberal use of Chinese characters and Pinyin romanization, for one thing.  Made it super easy to communicate with taxi drivers.  The Orientation section for each city is excellent... three paragraphs to prepare you for the layout and characteristics of the city.  History section is good, too.  I truly love the off-the-beaten path viewpoint that makes Lonely Planet so much fun... so I hope future editions retain this, while getting on the ball with useful / necessary details.<br />Using this book, traveller / reader will get a generally good trip, but will be led astray / waste time more than once by old info (where to catch bus to Buddha, where to find Muslim food, etc), and from incomplete phone numbers.re very helpful to the visitor.

Full of gushing observations about postmodernist connections between Scorsese's work and that of other film directors.<br />That's okay, because Scorsese is a brilliant postmodernist and pure film buff who happily steals (Hitchcock would be proud) from all kinds of filmic sources.  <br />However so much fun reader will have, going after all the videos this book praises, the pace and path of the writing can be almost overwhelming.  It is full of ricochets and breathless connections to all kinds of sources.  I found it annoying, sometimes, how rather reactive the text could be... this is like this is connected to this is from this is similar to this, etc etc.  <br />But I give it four stars because anyone who likes Scorsese will probably enjoy reading this.	2001-03-30

Oh, and the Secretary to the President of Cyprus!! (See details about The Last Temptation of Christ).  Quoted stories, observations, and comments all contribute to a fine portrait of one of our greatest active cinema artists.  (And, to the delight of film buffs everywhere, text shows that Scorsese is first and foremost an unabashed movie fan)!  Kelly's system provides the reader to form own opinions about Scorsese, rather than making a lot of critical conclusions.<br />In pursuit of my undergrad degree, I used this book quite a bit for research toward essays I wrote about Scorsese's films.  Not at all a chore to read, it was a very enjoyable book, great for the fan as well as the film scholar.  <br />Good index, good filmography.  Brief forewards by Michael Powell and Steven Spielberg hint at more than a bit of pure jealousy!	2001-03-30

He simply shares everything, and indeed he is, if nothing else, a true fan of movies!  <br />The insightful words of Scorsese, arranged to parallel his filmography up through New York Stories, are annotated by the redoubtable editors Thompson and Christie.  Scorsese is arguably the greatest postmodern artist, (and I would have to say the only postmodernist I unhesitatingly adore -with possible exception of Matt Groening), and the reader really gets to see how Scorsese constructs a film.  His inspirations are as predictable as directors Pasolini and Powell, yet as diverse as Mahatma Ghandi and Little Richard.  He loves all with equanimity and enthusiasm.<br />That's the joy of this book... the guy loves movies, loves making them, and all that energy just shines through.<br />Extremely valuable resource for the student of film, but good fun for the humble film buff, too.  Bonus: interesting black and white photos you won't find elsewhere.  Excellent (though naturally out-of-date) filmography appendix.	2001-03-30

She could be very charming and attentive, a soft-spoken original with deeply engaging, large eyes. But she was a difficult friend to many, becoming obsessively clingy and demanding of attention. A bitch and an angel; as unshakably sulky or as light-hearted as a child. Her hair she always carefully brushed, and yet sometimes she wore outfits so outlandish, she was mistaken for a tramp. (that's hobo, not slut). She was a sensitive and imaginative author who touched many hearts with her unsentimental writings about human longing. <br />Reading this book has been a strange ride. As impartial as the text is, it is next-to-impossible to avoid getting emotional as the reader, as I will explain in a moment. <br />The biographer has done a fantastic job of getting those who knew Carson to come forward with their various memories. It is very well-written, with family trees, thorough footnotes, many voices, interesting photos, an appendix consisting of summarized events in McCullers' life, and an excellent index. A generally well-edited and constructed biography, I find no fault with the biographer. It's the life of Carson McCullers that is so twisted and sour. That said, there are fun stories about living with Gypsy Rose Lee and of staying at Yaddo, the famous writers' retreat. But Carson's life was not easy. Tales of her drinking and near-delusional imagination, of her horrendous fights with husband Reeves McCullers, of lingering ill health, and of her leeching on friends has made reading this quite impartial book a considerably saddening adventure.   Nestled in the text is the rather interesting nugget stating that, soon after McCullers hit the literary big time with her The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, she was told during a psychiatric Rorschach evaluation that if her neuroses were to be cured, she would lose her ability to write so sensitively. (!) <br />Increasingly, McCullers lived her life with a disturbing mix of exaggerated suffering, of need and meanness, along with what the biographer saw as an irresistible love of love itself. But this reviewer is sure that some of her friends must have felt like flies caught in a puddle of spilt honey. <br />It has been interesting to read about how McCullers worked, and how she drew inspiration from real life events, acquaintances and their own tales. This haunting biography could be of interest to other writers, if only as a kind of caveat. The thoroughness of Carr's work allows an observant reader to glean lessons about the power of the human spirit and the destructiveness of the attitude that insanity fuels talent.	2001-03-29

It is very well illustrated and many of the photos show shadows and light to excellent effect.<br />It is something of a showcase for several Asian architecture firms, and the range of style is remarkably wide.  Powell gets into the philosophy behind each design, discussing such matters as flow, function, exploitation of view or site features, use of vernacular, even local religious or cultural beliefs.  Each house (total: 27) has its own chapter, with several good photos, general plans (!), elevations, and an essay about the structure and what each architect was expressing.   While the text is sober and without fluff, reader can find in it a pleasing sense of respect for land, nature, materials, culture.  (One disgusting exception: the photo of a room in a Thai house which contains several tiger and other exotic animal skins on the floor)! <br />If you are working with an architect and want to produce a certain effect, this book offers real solutions and helpful possibilities.  Amazing variety.	2001-03-24

(collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art).<br />Oates sees George Bellows as a true American artist: always on a quest of discovery, individualistic, heroic.  While not intended as a well-rounded exploration of Bellows, this rather short but intense book is a deep and strongly-felt critique of about 18 of his paintings.  The selection of work seems to be hers alone; she chooses paintings that elicit true passion and interesting insights.  Several interesting juxtapositions of American literature are in here, as well; all Oates' selection.  These help place Bellows in American history and culture.<br />Interesting for the American Art History buff; may not be of great interest to anyone else.

Author Golden succeeded in creating the crisply real voice of a geisha inside my mind.  There is a delightful calm throughout, yet the pace is a softly beating crescendo, as if crafted with the same careful deliberation and grace as an origami crane.  It's a treat for all the senses.<br />Great to read if you are planning a trip to Kyoto!

This particular book falls short of the standard set by Asian style gurus like Tan Hock Beng and Barbara Walker.<br />While this book is chock-a-block with professional photos of beautiful objets d'art and of sumptuous east-meets-western-interior-decorator homes, it comes off as an unsorted pile of images; the editorial vision never gets far beyond, &quot;hey, y'all, check out this neat-lookin' stuff!&quot;<br />One way the editor could have improved the flow of this book would have been to devote just one more pair of facing pages to each of the featured homes.  Facing pages are used to some advantage to concentrate on one given home, but these photos sometimes seem disjointed together rather than harmonious.  And far too much distance is put between the walls and the camera, so while the overall room can be studied, there is often a lack of up-close, detail shots.   <br />Positive elements: the traditional Japanese interiors are gorgeous, and there are nice shots showing how objects can be grouped; there are lots of hints on how to work east and west together.  <br />Negative elements: three categories of Oriental design and decoration as introduced in the preface are never referred to again; this could have been a way to organize the book! Reader is made to jump from a collection of ornate Chinese and Japanese armoirs (pages 104 - 105), to a variety of Asian bedroom interiors (pages 106 - 107), to 3 rooms of a contemporary Philippines residence (pages 108 - 109).  ...it's annoyingly random.  There are too many photos of antique shop displays (with overwhelming arrays of objects) with (get this) big price tags on the items, in plain view!  If you love the cluttered look, this may not be objectionable, but if you want to see more actual examples of putting a design element to its best advantage, this book won't measure up.  I found the examples of western homes using Asian artifacts to be odd, &amp; even sometimes quite insensitive to the beauty of the pieces. <br />To be sure, there are some lovely photos in here, and many of the pieces (individual design elements) are quite nice.  I don't doubt that the average reader will find something here to be inspired by.  But there is a general lack of order and subtlty, and far too many inappropriate juxtapositions of images on the same page.	2001-01-26

She writes with enthusiasm and love for many essential aspects of the appeal of a culture known for its centuries-old aesthetic and for its mass-production and other mass sensibilities.  <br />Tam's education at the Hong Kong Polytechnic gives her a unique vantage point for isolating Chinese chic.  She can view Cultural Revolution paraphrenalia with the eye of a designer, collector, and artist, rather than with painful memories.  In a show of global sophistication, she understands East-meets-West sensibility (her chapter on Chinglish is told with an appealing tenderness).  The text comes off without a shimmer of self-consciousness or compulsion to 'be Chinese.'  There is camp, sex, zen, pizzazz and beauty, exploding off of every page and augmented by Tam's tales of exploration and appreciation.    <br />Bonus interviews with composer Tan Dun and choreographer/visionary Danny Yung are painfully short, but the reader still gets a healthy dose of young Chinese intelligensia.  The text is endearingly personal, Vivienne Tam sharing with the reader what her senses take in.  It's quite delightful.<br />Great keepsake for people who have visited Hong Kong or Shanghai!	2000-12-19

Actually, the two books could be an interesting comparison study. It would also be a useful reference for critiques of Orientalism and Colonialism.   <br />If you like reading travel accounts, this is at times a very engaging one.

Meant to be witty, and written with style, I suppose this book could yet be a valuable primer for preparation for a move to New York.<br />Actually, unlike the amusing and bright HBO series, this book was quite depressing.  Full of snippets of neurotic relationships and desperate sex, the book is one tale of failure after another.  Whether or not the tales are true, the book highlights a bizarre kind of pathos in human relationships.<br />If you are not an urban American, the humor will either be totally lost on you, or you will have to wade through the book's ludicrous and counterproductive foibles of an ill society to get the obscure laugh.  Actually, I am an American who has lived in a big city there, and I still didn't read anything in the book that made me laugh out loud.  It was just sad.  More than a decade ago, Cynthia Heimel wrote about women and sex with a zest and hilarity that is not in evidence in Bushnell's work.  (I recommend Heimel as a sane voice in the world of single women). <br />Yes, Sex and the City is full of titilating sex and sexiness, making this great group reading material at slumber parties for 11 year old girls (parents, you know what I really mean), but there is never a mention of a relationship based on friendship, trust, and love.  Written humor's gotta have a little contrast to work well!<br />Compared to this book, I think most porn movies have a sweeter sense of warmth and tenderness.	2000-10-19

(That is not a typo).<br />Vickers starts out with about 30 somewhat lacklustre pages tackling the topic of how the Balinese themselves recorded their history.  He does an admirable job of garnering what details he can from what little must still be in existence of pre-Dutch Balinese historical texts.  Then Vickers turns on the heat with his isolation of who it was that &quot;discovered the Balinese breast!&quot;  (A European doctor who did plenty of homework)! <br />Much amusement and fun follows, along with profound explorations of the evolution of Bali's image as both a paradise on earth and a land of strange magic and the supernatural... the so-called island of the Gods.  <br />Vickers' book really makes the reader aware of how historic and cultural details get lost along the way to progress and prosperity.  It is a complex series of actions and decisions that have shaped today's Balinese culture.  Vickers shows plenty of sympathy for artists ignored by influential Baliphile Walter Spies (who, possibly more than any other westerner, has shaped the 'look' of what we think of as traditional Balinese arts and crafts).  Yet this isn't a treatise from a bleeding heart, and he shows how forces other than western colonialism are as much to blame for that which makes people use the tired exclamation that Bali is not what it used to be.<br />Vickers shows the importance of WHO observes, catalogs, records, and promotes a culture.  There is plenty of food for thought about the shortcomings of a plan to make a culture sit in a vaccuum instead of evolve with the ideas of its people.	2000-10-19

It takes place in the Austrian royal court at the time of Mozart's own prodigious childhood.<br />While there are horrific moments highlighting the destructive effects of ill-conceived parental control, O'Doherty sheds light on the mysterious penchant talented people have for falling into the hands of suppressive creeps.  The doctor seems sincere enough, but even he cannot keep his hands off the lovely musician.  <br />Chapters told by different characters, the story is a fine exercise in viewpoint and voice.  O'Doherty sets his scenes with amazing conservation of adjectives.  The language and syntax alone paints vivid pictures of court settings.  This reader really got the impression O'Doherty did his research meticulously.<br />Now that the author's shortlisted for the Booker, we have good reason to snap up this out-of-print novel!	2000-10-16

This is the Gloria Steinem school of feminist politics.  While it's fairly foaming with Liberal self-righteousness, the packaging (Pollitt's excellent prose) is a delight.<br />The book is one gorgeous essay after another.  Much of the time, I couldn't agree with her politics, but she argues heroically.  It's a very engaging way to learn classic American feminist thought, and an excellent source of examples of well-written essays.<br />I think it's too easy to condemn this writer for her political views alone.  Rather than doing that, I say it's a great book because of its fine crafting.  Here Pollitt presents the points of Liberal feminism, argued as well as they possibly could be.  As a collection of such, it can only be very useful to feminists of all political inclinations.	2000-10-13

The plot: Dying like a glowing ember on the end of a mosquito coil (insecticidal incense which is the metaphor for a dwindling life, a circuitous memory), an old lady in a British hospital shares with the reader her poignant memories of life as an intrepid war correspondent in Egypt.      It is beautifully written and has haunted me like few other books I have known.

In the book there is a wonderful theme of how we think of the past, and what the past means to us.  There is also more than a glimpse into the lifestyles of 20th century British colonial elite.  As a child, Lively could straddle different realms, different cultures, and this is the fascinating heart of the book.      She grew up with ruling class privilege in British-occupied Egypt, and yet she had a child's access to local village life.  She had a devoted governess, but the grown Penelope realizes how little they shared of each other.  There are many fascinating parallels of home and country, such as the weight of a distant, somewhat cold mother/land.     Nowadays, there's a lot written about the phenomenon of the Third Culture Kid.  Usually, and to speak very simplistically, this refers to American kids who grow up overseas and cannot feel any true attachment to the US, but who are not visibly connected to the land where they spent so much of their childhood.  In the worst scenario, these people can end up with severe feelings of rootlessness, and with a sense of never quite belonging.  Lively beautifully and sensitively writes of this lack of connection.      Aside from Oleander, Jacaranda being a wonderful story of returning, it is a comforting read for those who are affected by Third Culture Phenomena.  I urge ALL EXPATRIATE parents to obtain and read this book!  My third culture daughter read it at age 15, and I would recommend it to others in her age group and cultural situation.    Also great by Penelope Lively: Moon Tiger (Fiction).	2000-10-13

But many small schisms are mentioned, making it a rather complete history of the religion for such a small book.  Geographical and scholarly paths are generally traced, showing a good overview of this religion's spread.  It's well organized and a good read.<br />My only dislike is that not enough text is dedicated to an exploration of the life of Gautama (Conze gives about 2 pages only), including his many attempts at enlightenment and the final long confrontation of all his past lives.  Possibly this omission is made so as not to bring in too much religious doctrine (this is, after all, a history OF the religion), but I found the lack of coverage annoying and puzzling.	2000-10-06

I bought it in its first publication by Hong Kong's 'The Guidebook Company' in 1990, along with the usual Lonely Planet and an updated version of Bill Dalton's extremely hefty Indonesia guide. (I first took his book to Indonesia in '79, and his guide continues to be invaluable to the drifting back packer and serious off-the-beaten-tracker, but that type of guide may be overkill for the package traveller to Bali). <br />I find I keep returning to Charlés book for cultural references.  Whereas the Lonely Planet and Dalton are great for planning where to stay and how to get around, and they're chockablock with data, data, data, this little gem of a book is a great if simple tool for planning cultural events and jaunts.  It's laid out in an attractive fashion, with all kinds of great photos.  Very interesting sidebars highlight personalities, artists, or historical events.  It's light enough to be the only guide book you might need, especially if you plan to stay in one place (as on a package deal) and confine your forays into different villages and beaches to day trips only.   <br />So if you are limited in your time in Bali, and you have to plan your days with care, spend a week or two with this book before you go, and it will quickly guide you to the things that interest you most.	2000-10-05

In it, I credit a &quot;Dr. Fabius&quot; with supplying author Vicki Baum with invaluable cultural notes on the Balinese.  Actually, as Adrian Vickers points out in his marvelous book, Bali: A Paradise Created (also available here through Amazon), Dr. Fabius is simply a pseudonym for the phenomenally influential German artist and long-term Bali resident Walter Spies.<br />This oddity is probably of little consequence to one's enjoyment of the novel by Vicki Baum.  However, it is food for thought; Spies had a singular interpretation of what was the essence of Balinese culture.  Artistocratic, gay, and cultured, Spies had firm ideas about what the Balinese needed from the outside world. In a position of ambassador between Balinese royalty and western glitterati, his guests included Baum, the electrifying Margaret Mead and Charlie Chaplin, and through these contacts he did much towards what he thought was best for Bali. He was a highly influential afficianado of Balinese art and music.  Vickers suggests that as Spies would patronize one artist and ignore another, he was very strongly shaping the culture of Bali.  It would have been in Spies' interest, also, to show Bali and its colonizers in a certain light.  Baum produced a novel that  highlights Spies' general views, interestingly very much like those of today's usual western visitor to Bali.  So this novel is a significant part of the image we have, today, of Bali and its people.	2000-10-04

It certainly was that for me.<br />It's a sweet, well-organized and beautifully illustrated story of a little house that had a whole metropolis built up around it. She (yes, the house is referred to in the feminine) gets a new life on a new lot in the country when a descendant of the original owner discovers her amidst a smog-choked, noisy city.<br />One poignant thought: more than fifty years ago, when this story was published, there was still plenty of rural room to just pick up and move to.  In this children's story some social historian could find some fine irony about the postwar suburbal exodus.  But aside from an unwanted tinge of &quot;we can run away from our problems,&quot; the story was able to point out for this young listener the ills of pollution.  Still in all, a wonderful book.	2000-09-21

Books	5	6	8	N	N	Laugh out Loud, but it's All True!	I think the book's piece about the rules of third world driving is one of the funniest things ever written.<br />PJ's been around the world enough times  to have had every imaginable episode of culture shock, and he writes about  these with fine humour.  Although he writes about things like being stuck  in the middle of a violent student protest demonstration in Seoul, he also  includes destinations where bullets and tear gas don't figure into the  plot.  <br />I don't see any racism in the book, and in fact he blasts it in  his piece on Apartheid South Africa which first appeared in The Rolling  Stone.  True, he's a Yank with Yank sensibilities, but that's where the  humor comes in... anyone who's been confused by &quot;the way we do things  here&quot; in a foreign country will appreciate O'Rourke's wry take on the  exasperation and fear known by the stranger in a strange land.<br />His  chapter on covering the America's Cup yacht race out of Fremantle,  Australia, is pure genius. <br />A great addition to any travel library!	2000-09-20

But no way does this sketchy guidebook  deserve a 3. <br />It's a good size to carry around and there are some really  nice little tidbits of background reading. But there is a real lack of  practical usefulness with this guide.  I really needed my other guidebooks,  too, which is a shame... if you're in one foreign city, one good guide book  should suffice.  This one didn't, quite. I think it would suffice for  someone coming in on the kind of package tour where all decisions are  already made about where to eat every meal, and where to go.  But if you  travel independantly, this book simply doesn't measure up.<br />The book  provides a good, simple overview map of the city, which is good for the  main streets and subway lines but I like to see neighborhood maps, too  (which you will always find in the Lonely Planet guides).  None were given.   Transportation section in the beginning makes it sound like bicycling is a  great way to get around, so it was very annoying to find, on the authors'  suggested 3-day sightseeing itinerary, that a bicycle won't do, since so  many of the crucial streets are closed to bikes.  Why didn't they choose an  itinerary that would include some of that cycling they espouse?  No walking  tours are suggested, either.   <br />I found the local expat weekly pulp  magazine, Shanghai Scene, I believe it was called, a lot more helpful for  finding great restaurants, shopping tips, and other meaty, useful info.  In  fact, the weekly gave phone numbers for all the museums I needed to go.   This book gives none.  Granted, Shanghai is the world's fastest changing  city and no book can truly keep up with all the new hotels and nightspots,  but things like the lack of phone numbers (of museums and restaurants)  meant I was always referring elsewhere for additional info.<br />The shopping  tips provided were minimal and without embellishment.  Ipassed lots of  great neighborhood markets that would probably have been mentioned in other  guidebooks but not this one.  And text mentions the area where bookshops  are to be found but neglects to mention that this same street is where you  will see all the great traditional Chinese calligraphy and painting  supplies.  I wonder what other unique Shanghai gems are ignored.<br />So while  the book is glossy with photos and full of fun cultural sidebars, it lacks  the nuts and bolts of a real traveler's guide book.	2000-09-14

Nice one-color illustrations throughout.<br />Anyway, this is a good reference  book for the following people:<br />-anyone studying the effects of tourism on  a native culture<br />-anyone considering doing business in a third world  country<br />-Bali fanatics<br />-travelers who seriously question their impact  on ANY society they visit<br />-travel agents<br />The surprising and well-argued  conclusion to the conundrum of &quot;if I pay to visit this temple/buy this  clothing/camp on this mountain/photograph this maiden, am I spoiling or  helping these native people?&quot; is not as simple as one might imagine.   It is rather touching in an unexpected way.  A worthwhile read.	2000-09-01

Not only are the photographs carefully composed to show harmony of the  organic and the man-made, but Tan Hock Beng's text offers useful comments  about using materials, line, light (and other factors) to design a great  tropical home or resort.<br />He concentrates on Bali, Thailand, Singapore,  Sri Lanka and Malaysia, but there is also a single example from each of  Tamil Nadu and Bintan.  Then he illuminates these featured structures with  plenty of photos from all over the region.  This format gives space to a  huge number of other hotels and homes and temples, without making the book  seem crowded.  Some very clever editing went into this book.  The  juxtapositions are quite effective.  Comparisons (for example, a series of  passageways in a Cambodian temple shown opposite an open-sided walkway in a  Bali boutique hotel) are well-chosen and useful. <br />The reader will  definitely get a sense of regional furniture, decor, and objets d'art, but  the concentration of the author is architectural / structural.  (Go to  books Bali Style, Thai Style, et cetera, for all the little details).   <br />There's a pleasing balance of the poetic and the practical, making this  a great resource and reference book.	2000-08-31

(Or just the thing  for the person who's seen the usual sunflower, skull, and terra cotta  styling and is dying to see some new twists on the Santa Fe look).  There's  some extreme modernity in here, bold color choices, and very individualist  gardens.  So although it was not what I wanted, it is indeed a collection  of hidden, off-the-beaten-track Santa Fe gardens.	2000-08-30

It is, however, a rich overview of the best of  SEAsian luxury architecture and furnishings.<br />Every page is simply  gorgeous, with photos &quot;bleeding&quot; out past the paper, one trait of  a good coffee table or style book.  There is little or no image repetition  in the coverage of the homes or boutique hotels featured, and each photo is  perfectly focused, every composition seen in its best light.  <br />In all the  shuffle of Thai grandeur, Balinese earthiness, and Malaysian simplicity,  the book might at first glance seem to be presenting a kind of fusion.  I  think it's fair to say that there is plenty of contemporary blurring of the  distinctions between regions, but the reader can also look for regional  elements and quickly learn them.  Each property is given its own  mini-chapter, which helps a lot.  And the regional details and  sensibilities really come alive when you read the accompanying texts, which  are the work of expert style writers.<br />In fact, the contributors list  reads like a who's who of style gurus.  There is the clever and quippy Made  Wijaya, descriptive Diana Darling, the meticulous William Warren, and  details-minded Robert Powell.  It's a great read!	2000-08-28

This  attention to pedigree may irk that reader who's looking only for design  tips or sources, but that's pure Wijaya.  His unique descriptions are  amusing and his name-dropping stays on the polite side of gossip.  Reading  this book, I became grateful to Wijaya for caring enough to record the  architectural history of Batu Jimbar, Sayan, and other pockets of Bali  chic.  Just as the jungle can overgrow a garden in one rainy season,  historical details can be lost as people die or move on... Wijaya's appetite  for who's who has spawned this delightful record of what hands moulded the  walls, seeded the gardens, and chose the accessories for any featured  house.<br />The vast majority of homes in the book are owned by expatriate  designers and artists.  This makes for  a great array of styles and  personalities, and although this book seems to concentrate on quirkiness  and individuality, the lighting, atmosphere, and sensibility are definitely  and purely Bali.  A fine book richly illustrated with Ginanneschi's  photographs.  A better investment than the usual Periplus style books.	2000-08-27

Last summer, a student tour guide and Admissions Office volunteer at a  prestigious Massachusetts college said that every letter of recommendation  is basically the same, glowing text, and so these are given little  consideration by the Admissions people.  After reading Paul's book, I am  convinced that that student was mistaken; I see now how incredibly  important a very well-written letter can be.  And Paul tells why, in  perfect, practical detail.    <br />This page-turner is a great book; it  clears up the mysteries, identifies the vagaries, and reveals the sheer  humanity of the admissions process.  Satisfying reading for the burnt-out  parent who needs a break from the Peterson Guide... and a &quot;must&quot;  for every high school guidance counsellor.	2000-08-26

There are actually many layers here, from a detailed study of white trash society to an exploration of the strength of  women.<br />Reading this book is a meaningful, painful, raw experience.  Yet  it is never hopeless and depressing.  I could not put it down once I  started it.  <br />The characters are all fully developed, and that is a rare  treat.  Certain things come to light in a slow progression with a sudden  blaze of realization, like the physical traits of the protagonist's  grandmother (I won't give them away).  I just read the amazon interview  with the author, and I find it significant that Ms. Allison is half-blind.   This novel fully and beautifully exploits the power of words versus  appearances (text over sight)... an awesome bit of writers' craft. <br />If  you liked Liars Club, you'll love this.	2000-07-04

The book heavily features hotel gardens, and I mean the massive gardens like the Bali Hyatt, not the  intimate, small hotel gardens like the Tandjung Sari's.  <br />It is good that  the editor includes photos of some of Bali's most interesting gardens, such  as Tirta Gangga, Walter Spies' Tjampuhan residence, and several sites  designed by Made Wijaya, but these photos do not always do the places  justice (strange angles, views of the gardens that do not show their best  aspects).  I concede that  the exception to this is the section devoted to  the gardens of the Batujimbar estate, which is the second best part of this  book.  But many of the photos left me wanting more variety, smaller margins  (larger actual photos), and better angles.  <br />The best chapter is  Traditional Gardens in Bali, but again the photos are often disappointingly  small.  And, from this chapter, conspicuously absent, were photos of Ubud's  Agung Rai Museum gardens and any number of single-family (not sacred,  public, or hotel) Balinese gardens. <br />Somewhat useful is the chapter on  Balinese plants, but because it lacks stats like height and shade / sun  preferences, it is not great as a reference for the person interested in  some serious landscaping or plant identification.  <br />Text does have  interesting tidbits about garden history, thanks to contributor Adrian  Vickers (and, for the Ubud text, William Warren).  <br />Visually, not as bold  as \\"style\\" books can and should be.  I put other books on my coffee table.	2000-07-04

This blend of  cultures and languages has given her a unique understanding of the nature  of translation, of roots, of travel, and of culture.  These are themes she  addresses in her poetry.  <br />Her skill with words is considerable, and no  two poems resemble each other.  There are many voices, many situations.   There is humor, horror, urban paranoia, love, and struggle.  I treasure  this volume as much for its skillful craft as for its tender stories of  Asian women.  <br />Her prose afterword, entitled Tongue and Root, an essay on  the subject of translation and the English language, is quite wonderful.  Excellent for students of linguistics and translation, or of modern Asian  history,  but I would think anyone interested in the problems of the Third  Culture phenomena would find a lot to like in this book.<br />An essential  part of any library of Asian Women's Studies.	2000-07-03

A few times, there is a huge hunk of text, illustrated only with  a line drawing of Saussure!  Saussure's work is a lot to digest, and the  sort of reader (like me) who is attracted to a book like this is in need of  some simple explanations and illustrations that really make the text come  alive.  The book actually makes matters more complex.  There is little  attempt to meaningfully place Saussure in history, and no mention of how  differing modern liguistic theories evolved from either illumination of or  dissent from Saussure.  This sort of historical context, which I now  understand, would be a really helpful feature in an illustrated guide to  Saussure.  This book is actually a great little example of how NOT to write  an idiot's guide.<br />The Gordon/Lubell book only made my confusion worse,  and I ended up slogging on through Course in General Linguistics, pestering  my professors after every lecture, and so on.  My final &quot;A&quot; owes  nothing to Saussure For Beginners.<br />I would be most grateful to any  scholar of Linguistics who can visit this review site and post a comparison  of the Gordon book to a more simple writing on Saussure.  Future first-year  Linguistics students will appreciate it.	2000-07-02

Most people would be far too embarrassed to reveal certain family and personal details... Karr brings them all out alongside the more public kinds of  stories she might tell.  <br />To read her words is to step into another's  life.  I think it is fair to say that all of us have stories we keep secret  until the grave, and we also have the stories that we happily tell over and  over again.  One gets the impression that Karr is really telling  everything, just to give an accurate account of her unique childhood. As a  reader, I felt privileged to be allowed into Karr's life story.  Not unlike  being in a club of sorts.  This sense of collusion is a strong thread in  the book, and makes me ponder the power of the word, of secrets, and of  writing.  <br />To read the book is to be faced with unpleasant and  heart-wrenching details, but there are lovely little touches on every  page... her descriptions of other children are especially good.  Karr is a  very fine writer, and there is a lot of warmth and wonder throughout the  text.	2000-07-01

Her step-daughter's memories are somewhat interesting; it's a good read that sits with dignity on either a bedroom night stand or the coffee table or the cookbook shelf.   <br />Don't get this book if you want to start to learn Mexican cooking.

One might then ask, why bother with this book if  it's about death, a heavy subject my kid hasn't been exposed to?  Well,  actually, it is a very uplifting story about life itself.  No psychobabble  or religious references, just a simple story of family, bonds, and  tradition.  Jukes' writing is beautifully crafted, making this simple story  very meaningful.  Death itself is dealt with matter-of-factly, and there is  nothing scary in the book.<br />Though tinged with sadness, it is truly  wonderful, and there are even a couple of good laughs.  (Like life itself,  no?)<br />Highly recommended.	2000-06-28

He did have a famous extramarital affair (leading to his second marriage) that he touches on in the most oblique, huffy manner, and, as if it was always  fresh in his mind, he seemed to feel a need to be defensive. <br />I am sure  that others wrote better Wright biographies, and so I am inclined to  recommend that the reader find one of those first.  This book is probably  better for a researcher looking to quote Wright.<br />He explains his  architectural concepts somewhat generally, but those parts are engaging.   He is warm towards his mentor, family, and friends, saving the book from  being a complete rant.<br />A highly polished ego shines from the pages, not  surprisingly.  The writing really drags at times, to the point where I had  to put the massive thing down for about a year before having the guts to  pick it up again and finish it.  Not totally unenjoyable, for it is, after  all, the word of one of the most respected and admired architects in  history.	2000-06-27

To me, that's a plus in a college.  I was also unfazed by the  criticism of that school's lack of a core curriculum. (By the same token, I  was very glad for intelligence on which schools have become strangled by PC  absurdities).

The elegant  photographs of his work (going back to the 50's) are magnificent.  It is an  art in itself to photograph sculpture, and I am sorry to say that my search  for the photographer's name ended in frustration.  He or she deserves a lot  of credit.<br />There are also wonderful snapshots from Neri's life, with many  nice photos of the artist with second wife Joan Brown (see Tsujimoto,  Karen: The Art of Joan Brown).  It's a real slice of an exciting era in  west coast art: the 50's, 60's and 70's.<br />What Neri has done for  figurative art covers a greater scope than that of the San Francisco Bay  Area, yet he is firmly part of the Bay Area figurative tradition.  All the  contributors speak of the atmosphere into which Neri arrived as an art  student, but particularly Beardsly places him in a unique, thriving  artists' society.  He does this by writing about how Neri's relationships  with Joan Brown and Mark DeSuvero impacted his work; their images live and  breathe with profundity in certain of Neri's sculptures (shown with the  text).   <br />The book is divided in two: the artist's work and the artist's  life; both are compelling enough, it would have been unwise to mix them.   The book is very well organized. <br />Neri's work may at first appear too  rough to the eye that only knows Rodin and Donatello, but a second look  will discover the grace and energy the artist creates in every work.  It is  a great book for anyone interested in figurative art. Neri's studies and  drawings are quite beautiful by themselves... A great book for any artist  who enjoys capturing the figure, either the one who just likes to dabble in  life drawing or the serious and technically-minded draftsman.  Anyone at  all can find in Neri's work a new way to look at line and the figure.  Also  great for anyone who wants to get to know Bay Area art.	2000-06-23

Read the synopsis in the editorial reviews if you want to see the full plot.  <br />As always, Marquez offers a unique and haunting  plot with a cast of intriguing characters.  He always seems to invent  somewhat gothic situations but paint them with the radiant touch of an  Impressionist.  This book is a fine example of his skillful storytelling.   As in most of his works, a bizarre series of events take place in a rotting  but fascinating South American coastal province.  Here, all events  contribute to the tragic demise of the beautiful and cursed Sierva  Maria.<br />In any other writer's hands, the story would be heavy and  overwrought.  Somehow, Marzquez makes it sparkle and shine like a treasure.   If you don't know Marquez, start with the flawless Love in the Time of  Cholera or this beautiful, short novel.	2000-06-22

This tale of a Chinese family in England is at times a good series of lessons on Chinese culture.<br />Somewhat clumsily (at times) juxtaposing  triad gang strife with the struggle of a family to succeed, Mo weaves a  story that is fun to read.  <br />Mo is a master craftsman of dialogue.  His  careful way of transposing Cantonese into English is to be praised... the  reader really feels he is understanding another language.	2000-06-20

Last year, I settled for this one and probably won't look further.<br />This one is very good for identifying everything from sponges to turtles.  Each type of  creature (usually a phylum or an order) is organized into its own chapter,  which begins with a couple of pages of general facts that generally cover  reproduction, feeding, and interesting characteristics.  Then come the  pages of very good color photos of each variation (there are over 20  different clownfishes identified... not bad!)  These are labeled with their  common name and their Latin name.  <br />But unlike Margaret Gremli's Marine  Life in the South China Sea (albeit a less complete and orderly field  guide), Allen and Steene's book does not offer any interesting tidbits of  information NEXT TO the creature's photo.  Each entry is just a name,  sometimes with a height in centimeters.  In other words, it's great for  getting the exact name of the fish you just spotted forty feet down, and  your dive log will gain some cred, but you won't immediately find any  descriptive text or amusing information about that fish in its entry.   Don't get me wrong, this is a great field guide, and it took me 10 years to  find this.  But some divers may prefer the &quot;hey, did you  know...?&quot; format of Gremli's book (ISBN 9 789624 215427, published by  APA Publications (H.K.) Ltd).	2000-06-20

And the title of the collection implies a lot: the protagonists are all  generally strong women who lose it over the Marlboro Man.<br />But there is an  underlying pathos in the collection, an electric charge of wild man and  level-headed woman.  I am sure you could turn out a killer essay exploring  the sexual politics in these stories, but they are also just good  fun.<br />The tales are very well-written, and the settings are very nicely  described.  If the reader wants to feel what it'd be like to escape to the  high desert with a trapper like Jim Bridger or to the mountains with a cute  outlaw like Jesse James, reading this book is a good way to do that.<br />The  writer's obvious familiarity with exciting, rugged skills like snow camping  and game scouting is impressive, and this knowledge gives the stories extra  substance.<br />Warning to animal lovers: contains hunting.	2000-06-20

This book was useful as an outline of what a college-bound student can do to make an impression on an Admissions office.<br />That's the best thing I can force myself to say about this publication, a book by an extremely  ambitious young man.  The text is peppered with a weisenheimer-esque, hyper  self-centered attitude.  Good to see a kid with oodles of self-confidence  get what he's after.  But often he comes off as part of the elitist,  scratch-your-way-to-the-top, realm that I'd assumed Ivy League schools were  nowadays trying to distance themselves from.  <br />Reading this creepy book  gave me a negative impression of Yale's standards.	2000-06-19

Read it aloud to ages 3 to 6.<br />Sid and Midge are pigeons who eat the bread crumbs from Blum's  Bakery (now the Macy's Union Square entrance ...ugh) and enjoy the city  together, particularly Union Square.  Kids can really relate to Sid's  plight on a horribly stormy day, when he is separated from his lovely  Midge.  They are happily reunited, and the sun shines just as beautifully  as every San Franciscan knows it can.  <br />Illustrated in quite colorful  pencils, all in 50's fashions (a time when no San Franciscan woman went  outside without hat and gloves) with charming views of the city that kids  will joyfully recognize.  <br />A classic!

A bit abridged, if you know the tales already, but these are a fine collection.<br />Little One-Inch is Japan's Tom Thumb, and he is shown wending  his way down a stream in a boat made of a rice bowl, using a chopstick for  propulsion.  <br />There are ten stories in all, sweetly illustrated in  Japanese style.  Kids 3 to 10 will enjoy these; my favorite is The Rabbit  Who Crossed the Sea ...on the backs of sharks he somewhat maliciously  tricks into helping him.  The listener learns Rabbit's hard-won lesson  about fooling people, and they are given a delightfully amazing picture of  Rabbit using the sharks as an inter-island bridge.<br />One warning: there is  a color picture of Little One-Inch poking a needle into the eye of a demon,  but I've seen more frightening pictures in Disney publications.  In  general, the book has nothing scarier than what western fairy tales offer.	2000-06-18

Dickey simply acknowledges these and strives to give  insightful reports of the volatile politics and diverse societies (mostly  those of foreigners) in the vast region covered.  There is a guileless  sense of truth on these pages that stays with the reader.<br />There are very  good chapters about Arabs themselves: a censured writer in Cairo, e.g.,  Dickey's record of stunned Iranians voicing their dismay in reaction to a  particularly heinous American military blunder.<br />Dickey offers occasional  history lessons (the chapter on Oman's leadership), humor (the witty  chapter about British expats in Dubai), and poignant human interest (many  chapters touch upon the innocent lives scarred or ended by various military  acts).<br />I picked this up thinking I was getting a light book about western  expats, but that is a very small part of Dickey's focus.  He writes of  Filipino tanker crews facing mortal danger with a smile and a shrug, a  Russian businessmen in a bad suit and the UN's splendidly stylish Turkish  PR man, a self-important French Canadian aid worker.  Dickey's contacts are  many and vivid.  <br />The book is resolutely but subtly anti-war.  It will be  impossible for a reader to generalize about Arabs after reading Dickey's  book.  <br />A great book to give to anyone going to an Arab country, either  as expat or visitor.	2000-06-18

In the style of Grand Hotel (which later spawned the  genre of human interest disaster movies), the novel's characters are only  human, poignant in their foibles. Among them are the pretty little dancer  Lambon, her selfish but likeable brother Pak, the proud entertainer Raka,  the bored Dutch bureaucrat Boomsmer. There is royalty and slavery and  peasants and mystics: Baliphiles will love this re-release of a  classic.<br />The book never belittles the Balinese with colonialist tactics,  and Baum compiled the story from the meticulous notes left to her by Dr.  Fabius (longterm resident of Bali).  It is a fine story about human error,  human virtue.<br />A bit fat and unwieldy, this paperback would be better read  BEFORE you hit the road for Bali.

One-sided book written in praise of China is seldom more than a curiosity.<br />Shapiro moved to China in the post-war era of egalitarian struggle for freedom from empire.  He lived there for another  three decades (the book is published in 1979), and this memoir covers those  30 years.<br />It is a valuable bit of the history of the changing times of a  large and fascinating country, but the book's facts and honesty are  questionable.  Shapiro is an extraordinary individual who denounced his US  citizenship and lived in Beijing as a Chinese citizen. The book is pure  public relations, and he glosses over the Great Leap Forward and Cultural  Revolution with irritating bits of patriotism.  Of course, he was allowed  to be highly critical of the Gang of Four, and the reader gets an earful of  that housecleaning.  <br />Nevertheless, the fact that An American in China is  an eyewitness account adds interest, and the chapter of his visit back to  the States in 1971 is somewhat engaging.<br />Only appealing to a real  Sinophile.	2000-06-18

But it's really a wonderful volume for anyone  who wants an in-depth understanding of the Balinese.<br />Eiseman is thorough  in his detail, but the style is not at all dry and academic.  There are  lovely little personal anecdotes, and it really comes from the heart of a  man who has spent much of his life in Bali.<br />Cosmology and religion are  covered in this volume, such as an explanation of how a home is built with  respect to cosmic forces and directions. There is a valuable guide to  festivals, complete with calendar.  Especially fun is Balinese astrology,  and the author writes extensively about this.  <br />A possible approach: read  the Lonely Planet cultural section first, then go to Bali, then read  Eiseman.	2000-06-18

He was certainly a  charismatic singer and performer, blessed with good looks. But a great  poet?  At UCLA, he discovered Kurt Weill and other college-boys' idols, was  smart enough to put it all together into rock n roll songs.<br />After  reading this biography, and paying more attention to Morisson's lyrics, it  seems that the Doors' success may be due just as much to Ray Manzarek's  original organ sounds as to Morisson's poetry.  A decent lyricist who had  Ray to work out the music, Morisson perhaps relied more on his considerable  bad-boy sex appeal than on any poetic genius.  At times, author gives  Morrison so much praise, it is embarrassing.<br />There is plenty of detail  about Morisson's boyhood, and by ignoring the author's superlatives (which  is fairly easy), reader learns about the life of a selfish man who happened  to be a dynamic performer.<br />Probably a &quot;must&quot; for Doors fans,  or anyone very interested in the LA music scene of the sixties.	2000-06-15

There is  plenty of pain, but no pleas for tears and sympathy.  It moves well, with  no boring parts.  Mostly, it is amusing and thought-provoking, a  bittersweet tale of ambition and good intentions mixed with laziness and  dreaming.<br />People fascinated with these themes will like it: the lure of  the west,  female family lineage,  crazy moms.	2000-06-15

Not only is it just too darn big for your  pocket, but there are no handy fill-in-the-blank common phrases and  questions. <br />Two very nice features of this book: 1) it is illustrated  with many photos of smiling Indonesians, an effective little trick to make  the reader remember to relax and smile more.  2)Every chapter is  chock-a-block with interesting advice about the culture, food, manners, and  so on.  <br />Glossary is not bad, but not very complete.	2000-06-14

Plenty of options for alternative curricula and scheduling  (like trimester systems, or 'great books' teaching).  Some of the schools  in the book are already &quot;hot&quot;, and some have a narrow scope that  would be perfect only for a minority of students.  That's the beauty of  this book: there is a good variety of schools and systems.  Do your own  additional research, but use this as a stepping-off point.<br />Generally, the  writer takes care to examine each school on its own merit, and each  institution gets its own chapter.  Nice to see that the author interviews  students at each college, asking questions about food, faculty attitude,  social life, recreation, as well as academic matters.<br />It's a good read,  valuable data for your college search process.<br />Other good references:  Fiske Guide, Choosing the Right College (ISI), and the Kaplan Newsweek  issue that comes out every summer.	2000-06-14

Fortunately, the MD who wrote it keeps the technical language simple. Dr. Lee is not a slave to any drug company, and his personal research covers a long period of time.  He is very frank about what further research does need to occur... reading  this is like talking to a really good, honest doctor. <br />Sleep disruption,  depression, irritability, lack of energy, swelling breasts, and other  symptoms may actually be the result of an easily-remedied hormone  imbalance.  Many do not know that natural hormones, in proper dosage, have  no harmful side effects, and thought that prescription HRT (hormone  replacement therapy), with its many known risks and side effects, was the  only way to combat the ageing process in women. Dr. Lee shows that ALL  women can benefit from a very simple natural hormone supplement.   <br />Do  not be deterred by the title.  Pre-menopausal women need the data in this  book.<br />An excellent explanation of the monthly hormonal cycle is in this  book.	2000-06-13

This is a valuable book.<br />It is a bit enormous, though, and there is no index.  This means that if the reader has to hunt for some little reference or fact, he or she is in  for a long trek through these pages. Although it is designed with many  short chapters, each devoted to a design element, the sheer amount of data  is somewhat daunting.  Alexander does write clearly, and in an informal,  second or first-person manner.  But there is little summarizing.  Probably  an excellent book to read cover-to-cover as part of a large study project.  So read this book and know it well BEFORE you talk to your architect,  contractor, designer... don't do as I did and start speed reading it when  the architect hands over the blue prints.<br />Note: Whereas feng shui is a  little more mystical, Alexander's suggested design tactics make practical  sense.  (I gently encourage any reader trying to choose between feng shui  and this book to go with the latter).  Very useful concepts for anyone who  wants to make the most of their living space.	2000-06-13

Especially good if the student has  no access to a college / guidance counsellor.<br />We started with this book,  &amp; ended up referring to it again and again.  But other useful college  selection publications are the annual Kaplan Newsweek college selection  issue (out in summer), Colleges That Change Lives (Pope), and the  ultra-conservative Choosing the Right College by William J. Bennett.   (Latter is very useful even to Leftists because he evaluates schools for  their political tendencies... a very good read)!	2000-06-13

It is permanently stocked by the campus bookstore.<br />It is a very good guide,  with actual examples of short essays by students. In my opinion, one of the  examples is a tad un-scholarly, using the first person and personal  anecdotes in what is otherwise a formal essay.  Some professors may not  approve... mine did. <br />I read this short book and used it; I am sure it  contributed to my high GPA.	2000-06-12

A bit like saying Western culture... a rather broad term.  But this book acknowledges that right away and does an admirable job of isolating the most important manners for visitors to know and use.<br />The  book's practical tips are especially useful, and these are organized with  finger-tip simplicity (Do's and Don't's appendix is great), making this  book easy to consult at a moment's notice.  Business section and home help  section (&quot;Translating Needs into Action&quot;) are especially helpful.   <br />There are also meaty and interesting sections about Indonesian values,  social structure, and food.  It's a good read, will serve well the traveler  or expat.  <br />Cultural quiz at the end, a test so silly no one could fail  it, is the only negative to this guide.	2000-06-12

Very beautiful as a coffee table book, quite useful as a style reference book.<br />The text is very  nicely written, without repetition or fluff; it serves mainly to illuminate  the huge variety of photographs.  In other words, the reader will learn a  little about Balinese geography, sensibility and culture from Walker, but  not in intricate detail or with scholarly authority.  I read it cover to  cover in a couple of days, and felt it was a decent grounding in Bali  style.<br />Author, editor and photographer should be praised for finding  examples of all kinds of Bali style: garish, sublime, fancy, plain, funky,  sophisticated, folksy, casual, formal, sacred.  <br />A solid overview, useful  to decorators, architects, mere Bali fans.	2000-06-12

No really useful maps here  (that's not the point of the book), but all the photos are accurately  labeled, making his discoveries - like  old abandoned villages and  picturesque coves - a snap to find on government maps.<br />Really a valuable  keepsake for anyone living in or visiting Hong Kong.	2000-06-07

All the stories herein were chosen for their examination of the traveler,  and the variety is excellent. <br />There are tales set in France, India,  Prague, and the Scottish Isles.  Some involve physical challenge, most are  about social and psychological challenges faced by the traveler.  Anita  Desai, Flannery O'Connor, John Cheever, and Charles Dickens penned entries.   I didn't find a single story that wasn't worth reading.  At a full 33  stories, even the most discerning reader would not find much  disappointment.<br />It is a very entertaining book to have along on a  journey, although any reader / traveler who packs light ought to know that  the paperback version is a full inch thick and significantly heavier than,  say, an average Penguin paperback!	2000-06-07

Berendt takes the reader behind velvet curtains  and antique walls into a society where pedigree is based as much on  lineage, wealth, and power as on quirky southern traditions like knowing  how to serve a fine platter of tomato sandwiches.<br />Forget Eastwood's  oddly disappointing film; this book is quite marvelous.  True crime lover?  You will enjoy the book's steamy setting and colorful characters, an almost  poetic break from the repetitive and merely competant writings by the likes  of Ann Rule.  Aristocracy - watcher? You will savour the odd little schemes  and intrigues exposed without any hint of malice.  The tragic saga of one  man's extraordinary ascent into high society is presented amidst many  delicious (and often hilarious) vignettes of all levels of Savannah's class  structure.  The author beautifully describes Savannah's magic, mystery, and  achingly sad decay.  Really, it is a fine tribute to this historic city of  likeable conmen, sexy ne'er-do-wells, conniving politicians, and obsessive  hostesses.<br />It's a real page-turner, a good companion if you are planning  to visit Savannah.	2000-06-07

The tales of atrocities and abuses are many, but this is a particularly extraordinary memoir, in my opinion the  best of the lot.<br />Nien Cheng suffered enormously, and her book recounts  her persecution in amazing detail.  She had more than 6 years to recall  every degrading and unjust incident, and it is remarkably all here.  Yet it  is never for a moment boring or tedious.  She writes beautifully and  appreciatively of the tasty snack her cook gave her the day she went to be  screamed at by an auditorium full of Red Guards.  It is this extraordinary  attention to simple goodness and the author's triumphant but humble  survival that sets this book apart.<br />Someone said to me, &quot;oh, I could  never buy that book.  I couldn't stand the pain.&quot;  My friend was  mistaken.  Nien Cheng's book is about pain, but not defeat.  To be sure, it  is about the hellish consequences of a society gone mad, but her own clear  conscience reigns supreme.<br />It is a quite beautiful story of the triumph  of the human spirit.  Outstanding.	2000-06-07

Should not be a reader's first book about Chinese art, but is very useful for, say, college art history at any level.  <br />In what I found to be the most useful chapter, &quot;Significant  Criteria for Period Style,&quot; Stanley-Baker manages to isolate exactly  what attributes belong to Song, Yuan, and Ming paintings.  Her observant  writings that link the physical with the spiritual (e.g. breathing space in  relation to mountains in landscape paintings) are wonderful in their  simplicity.  Her essays will certainly enrich the connoiseur's love of  Chinese art.<br />I see this book as indispensable to the student of Chinese  art and highly recommended to the amateur of same.	2000-06-07

A &quot;must&quot; for students of modern American art as well as those just wanting to get a  better understanding of what Pollock was REALLY DOING.<br />Large format  features fold-out reproductions of breathtakingly high quality.  Among  these, incredibly, are paintings not found in any other published sources.  (The incomparable Lucifer (1947) is one such work).<br />The text is  scholarly but readable, and although there is a considerable amount of it,  each open page of writing offers at least a couple relevant and highly  interesting photos or other illustrations.  The many large color plates  would certainly make a gorgeous and impressive coffee table book for anyone  who doesn't choose to read it.<br />Kirk Varnedoe writes definitively about  Pollock's mercurial life &amp; career.  Varnedoe's nearly 75 pages of  biographical analysis are a welcome alternative to the kind of misguided  mythologizing about Pollock that has for a long time colored the artist as  an overrated art &quot;star.&quot;<br />Pepe Karmel's contribution to this  book is an amazing analysis of Pollock's painting process through an  exhaustive examination of the famous films and photographs of Pollock at  work.  This was a fascinating, ground-breaking part of the exhibition, and  is equally wonderful in the book.<br />Well worth the price.	2000-06-05

The China rafting story is  the best part of the book.<br />Might be a good read for high-school age boys.   A warning to animal lovers: contains descriptions of hunting.	2000-05-28

Exhaustive analysis of the mechanics of the human mind.  Published in 1950 before Hubbard more fully honed his system of mental health, the techniques in this book are nonetheless highly effective for helping anyone who is  suffering from mysterious pains and emotions.    Update 7 years later:  I just finished reading this book for the 4th time and I want to add something to my review. This is a meaty book, as demanding of careful reading as the materials of any university course.    Read the book with a dictionary close at hand, go as slowly as you need to. Full time, on a 4th reread, this took me three weeks! Although many readers have been known to get a lot out of the first few chapters and stop there, finding Dianetics groups in their area, it really pays to read the whole thing.    The portent of this topic (the human mind) practically demands a careful study. This is no comic book or little religious tract you find on a bus. It's a handbook developed after years of hands-on research. Approach it that way and there are some fascinating things to be learned.    We really have a lot of choices in this world, for how to deal with our insanities. Insanities: I don't mean idiosyncrasies and personalities (never the cause of mental problems and destructive societies), but the actual source of war, hatred, violence, and destruction.    We can take drugs to mask the symptoms, we can get away from other people, we can dramatize our hatred and go around raving, we can pray, we can lock ourselves up and watch TV, we can try rolfing and rebirthing and yoga, we can distract ourselves with hobbies, we can commit suicide, or so many other choices... but at least we can also use Dianetics in principle or in its exact technology to terminate the actual source of man's mental pain and grasping self destruction.	2000-05-16

Wijaya (born Michael White in Australia) known for his intimate knowledge and  appreciation of the Balinese culture, reveals a well-traveled, discerning  eye for garden style in a wide area of the Asia-Pacific tropics.   Richly  illustrated with sketches and fine photography, this has the appearance of  a coffee table book.  Yet Wijaya's anecdotes and criticisms make for a good  read.  While the author does not get into the nitty-gritty gardener's  how-to's, it is an indispensable reference book for anyone wanting to learn  more about tropical landscaping.  <br />To impart an understanding of the  tropical vernacular, Wijaya brings out a variety of sources for  illustration.  One entire chapter is devoted to an historical overview of  the tropical garden, and it is peppered with old prints and photographs.   Throughout the book are paintings, colonial-era vignettes, and nicely  drafted sketches.  Also useful is Wijaya's list of (mostly) Asian gardens  that can be visited for reference or pure enjoyment of the tropical garden.   Although the author includes a list of plants that flower in the wet  season, there is no other list of botanicals, which would greatly assist  the reader seriously involved in garden design.  Tropical Garden Design is  a style book, and a very entertaining one, at that.	2000-05-12

Crusoe is cruel to animals (on pikes, he  impales the bodies of little birds with the intention of frightening others  from his crops).  He is wasteful of natural resources (whittles down one  large tree to make a shelf).  He is an outright coward (he is terribly  afraid of a goat).<br />This rather rambling, disorganized book is nonetheless  a sharp indictment of man's supposed superiority over nature.  Fascinating  fodder for the student of ecological literary criticism.	2000-05-10
