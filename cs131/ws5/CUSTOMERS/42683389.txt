US	42683389	R39KUGOYRSCBO9	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	5	1	3	N	N	As I write this	As I write this, the book is listed within the top 25 selling books on Amazon. It has close to 1300 reviews. And it was written 4 years ago. <br /> <br />My opinion will hardly change your mind. <br /> <br />I read this after reading De Vinci, and I am glad too. Sure this takes place before De Vinci, but after the (very minor) let down of De Vinci when it came to the end, this book was the complete opposite. To the last chapter of the book, it had be stuck on it. I enjoyed this more than De Vinci, and with good reason. The book didn't get stuck on the same repeating themes that De Vinci did. This one was more entertaining, and, albeit a less believeable story, was just plain better. It isn't so much the story itself, but the way it was written. De Vinci's story was good, but it had too many repeated themes. This one was much more original as far as themes repeating, it didn't have some of the same lines over and over. So yeah, just like read it and stuff.	2005-01-18

Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over.	2005-01-08

The book covers basics, including of course, the history of CLF. There are 2 forms in the book, a Horse stance form, and a long range fighting form. It covers in detail different blocks, footwork and methods of attack, and application of the art. While by no means complete, it is a very detailed and written book covering alot of aspects of CLF.

This comic, in my opinion blows all other art away, even in other comics Ross has drawn. I originally bought this book FOR the art and I was so impressed I went out and bought as many of Alex Ross' books as I could get my hands on. The story is set in WW2 and the 1960s Marvel Universe, so you get to see some of the history of Marvel. It isn't a superhero book either but rather follows the life of a simple photographer in New York City and ends with one of the most famous Marvel stories ever.	2003-03-20

The comic is HUGE and by huge I don't mean thick, but H-U-G-E. Batman is not full of gadgets and a fast car, but rather watered down to a man with some rope and a grappling hook as he fights crime in the ghettos of Gotham. He comes to terms with what he might have been after his parents were murdered when he meets a young boy who's parents were murdered in front of him. Batman realizes after his parents death he could have turned to a life of crime instead of crime fighting.	2003-03-20

I originally bought this more on a gamble than nothing else. I had never read a single issue of Astro City and after reading this book I wash hooked. There is a much deeper feeling to this book than normal comics, probably because you don't HAVE a main character. Each issue you meet a new superhero (at first at least) and see what they are like. The first book introduces you to some of the main characters and sets up for The Confessor story line.	2003-03-20

I originally bought this for my best friend, a random gift. He use to practice Aikido when he was younger and I was hoping to get him interested in it. However the book never left my house because I read the book and decided to keep it for myself. Greedy? Sure. The book is very nice because of the way it is written. It shows poetry written by O'Sensei as well as a brief story of his life. The most interesting part however is the fact that the person who created Aikido appears in the techniques. He is, by the looks of it, in his 30s and 40s, so he does not resemble the famous old man that people reconize. The photos, for there age, are quite detailed. I recommend this for any martial artist.	2003-03-18

This takes place some 10 years after The Sith War. All the characters have changed, grown old, morphed (the tiger female looks way cooler) and grown up. Nomi Sunrider's daughter is a teenager now and wants to learn to be a Jedi. Ulic Qel-Droma is hiding on some ice world and wants to die. She seeks him out to learn the ways of the Jedi. The reason I took away a star was because how she found him. Some random guy (who looks exactly like the guys at the start of the original Star Wars) took Ulic to the snow planet and she just randomly picks a ship to stall on and guess who's ship it is? 10 billion people in the universe and she picks the guy who saw Ulic a day earlier. Wow, ironic, eh? There really is no bad guy in this story, it just shows Ulic teaching the girl. The closest thing to a bad guy has to be the good Jedi tiger girl, Silvar. Anyhoo its a good book to end the series with.	2003-03-18

Very well written, it takes place 5 years after Return of the Jedi and an alien Grand Admiral has taken over the Empire. The book is very well written and has a strong feel of the movies without a sense of stealing from the movies. The only thing I found to be somewhat pitiful was this new Dark Jedi clone who was hiding on one of the Emperor's private planets guarding some huge secret. While this sets up for the huge climatic duel in the final book, I felt to be somewhat of poor authorship.	2003-03-18

This is, without a doubt, my favorite fictional book. E.V.E.R. There is some deeper sense that always gets me to return to this book. It is well written, and like I said to the first book in the series, does not borrow heavily on the films and when it does, in a good way. The ending, while somewhat predictable was also somewhat of a major plot twist that had your jaw drop to the floor as Mara Jade, the Emperor's top private assassin trained to use the Force and her final mission given to her by the Emperor to kill Skywalker, confronts Luuke Skywaler in a duel to the death.	2003-03-18

I think Kevin Anderson wrote this one, with the corny lines \\"HE HAS A SITH AMULET! THEY'RE DEADLY!\\" and \\"I wonder who that man is? I feel like I will learn much from him!\\" and \\"Dace is dead! I told him.\\" The Jedi in the final issue seem to be Supermen, unfallable. The story shows a young Jedi turn to the Dark Side because of the death of his master and another Jedi, Exar Kun turn to the Dark Side because he was just plain dumb. No really, he was. His Jedi Master told him not to go looking into The Sith because he is too young. Maybe he should have listened to the crab Master, I mean he IS A MASTER right? The art is good, except for issue 6. I don't know what happened, but issue 6 can not be part of the series. It is just awful, awful writing and art. The lightsabers are blue sticks. Seriously, they put NO effect into them at all. The coloring is poor on everything too. When it shows lasers or effects, its just 2 colors and not a variety of colors.	2003-03-18

If you've seen the new Enter the Dragon 25 year anniversary, its the one before the movie that lasts like 15 minutes. They should have included a text version in this book.<br />If you find this book on sale at a used book store or something, pick it up, it's worth it. But don't go spending full price for this, because it isn't worth it. If you find it on Amazon here along with another book (like Tao of Gung Fu and this together) then go ahead and get them. To buy this book solo though would just be a waste, you would have it done within a couple of hours.	2003-02-27

I read the book several times, but couldn't figure it out. Later I took up Wing Tsun (which contains the punch) and realized after being taught the punch, it is nothing like described in the book. .... Nothing great in my opinion.	2003-02-27

I am not short according to other people (I come in at around 6'1\\") but I find myself short. I come in at about 175 lbs. When I started working out using BFL, I came in at 150. Other than my shoulders and abs I have noticed no change in my physical appearance in comparison to the ones in the photos. I have gotten much stronger, but have not gotten bigger. Because of my metabolism, my body will not bulk up. I am very skinny, yet in some exercises I can match other people at the gym who are 2 or 3 times my size. All I got from this book was toning. He never talked about how a smaller person could get muscular using his method. I used his method and got stronger, just not bigger.	2002-12-14

The stuff that happened in that book was impossible, or next to impossible, and this is funny because the book is supposed to be science fiction. Perish forbid, I love the movies, but this book doesn't deserve the title. First of all, they use Arnold's brother, and he even is suppose to be just like Arnold. Then they chalk him up full of one liners \\"Good, maybe then I can get a nice apartment.\\" and all this other stuff. Arnold can only deliever the perfect one liners. Another thing I find dumb is when he just flys down to South America to visit a drug lord and spends his money to get there (not the drug lord).<br />I fail to see why this has 4 stars, I'd expected 2 and a half stars for the total review. It just wasn't that good of a book and I feel I have somehow lost intelligence from reading it...	2001-12-28

You can use his exercises. He teaches you 10 exercises, if not more, to use on each major muscle in the body. Not just one or 2. But 10 DIFFERENT exercises. This book will work for everyone, if you create your own work-out routine. You don't need steroids unless you follow his work-out routine. And you will also need an ambulance to take you to the hospital after killing yourself following his method. I use his exercises, and work every major muscle in my body, but switch exercises each time I work out and do two-three of each muscle. And I haven't seen any problems.

If you are just starting in martial arts however, this book will be hard for you to understand. If you are just starting out and read it, then read it again when you are more advanced in the fighting arts. However, this book is not one of Ashida Kim's \\"Learn to fight in 10 steps\\" type books (because his books are fake). Instead this book has a deeper meaning of Bruce Lee's infamous art.	2001-08-09
