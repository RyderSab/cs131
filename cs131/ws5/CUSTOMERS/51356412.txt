The \\"Cydonia\\" region contains what appear to be a \\"human face\\" carved out of a mesa, surrounded by several geometrically aligned pyramidal features. These were discovered first by the Viking 1 mission to Mars in 1976, and subsequent exhaustive investigations have spawned numerous \\"alternative\\" explanations, with elements taken from the classic redneck freemasonic - fallen angels conspiracy stuff, to reasonably argued remarkable reevaluations of Mankind and its history, in which man could have had several unknown advanced \\"prehistoric\\" civilisations that had colonised the solar system, or were based on Mars, before a cataclysm drove them here, to establish a successor civilisation in Egypt...they are now remembered as \\"gods\\" in legend...<br /><br />The book's voluminous content apart (which is quite exhaustive and very \\"shocking\\", for \\"classical\\" human historical doctrines) its overall value and credibility are ruined by Hoagland's style, which I must say is typical of an American travelling showman or circus stage presenter. Such people were often rascals out to dazzle, con and rip-off the gullible, and one is sorry to see Hoagland in such a light when addressing such a most serious topic. This isn't a Barnum and Bailley's travelling circus, or a roadshow for some magical potion. This attitude of his not only confuses what he wants people to know, but confounds both the reader and makes his own credibility suspect. Proper research here could change the course of history and Man's view of himself, and uncover a lot of nasty secrets... For those who want to explore this issue in the most helpful way, I would recommend Bruce Rux's book on Mars and other historical anomalies (search \\"Bruce Rux\\" on Amazon.com), which is even better than the other prolific author on these subjects, Graham Hancock who wrote the \\"The Mars Mystery\\".<br /><br />Mars finally appears to be at the root of all the strangest and murkiest, but yet most persistent mysteries of the Human race and its overall history and present...!finally appears to be at the root of all the strangest and murkiest, but yet most persistent mysteries of the Human race and its overall history and present...!	2005-09-20

Especially the post-Reagan and Thatcher \\"Reader's Digest\\" goddy-goody stuff. This book is written by one such \\"dissenter\\". Take the example of the nonsense here about eliminating Jews. Oh yes, tomorrow your eyes might well pop their sockets when you hear these propagandists trying to accuse Stalin of plotting to exterminate Red Indians and Australian aboriginals. It is as farfetched as that, but trust these propagandists to go to such lengths. Granted that Stalin was a brute no doubt. But who can not be, when ruling the most vast nation of the world spanning 11 time zones, and trying to develop and industrialise its peasant people overnight at the same time, to catch up with the \\"sophisticated\\" West? Something a ninny \\"autocrat\\" like Nicholas II couldn't have done with all his power. Stalin's brutality also saved the USSR from a worse brutal fate, that of Hitler's \\"lebensraum\\", which had got underway effectively and had resulted in the deaths of 27 million Russians. Had even the meeker Lenin or Trotsky been at the helm of Soviet affairs at that time, let alone Tsar Nikolai the Second, the world would now effectively be under the domination of the Third Reich, and all that it implied.<br /><br />Another untruth that this bohemian, scruffy slanderer of a writer tells us is about Soviet nuclear weapons. Many don't know, yet it should be noted that Stalin was against these weapons all his life, and they had to wait till he died for Sakharov to fashion the first Hydrogen Bomb. However, it will be infinitely easy for the purveyors of \\"free enterprise\\" and the \\"free world\\" to tell gullible, clueless Americans otherwise. This book and its theme amply illustrate that capitalism is the ultimate, insiduous evil over the \\"drab, totalitarian clunker\\" of Soviet communism - and that is borne out by what America has done to the world since 1991, and what it openly does nowadays under G.W. Bush in Iraq, his tax breaks for the rich, to the Kyoto protocol and how it is snatching its own citizens' rights in the name of \\"homeland security\\", to name just a few instances.Kyoto protocol and how it is snatching its own citizens' rights in the name of \\"homeland security\\", to name just a few instances.	2005-09-15

Although astrology is a vast field, and this book is limited only to transit delineations, once a student \\"gets the hang\\" of transits, he can proceed further afield. Even after gaining that, this book will always remain an indispensable basic reference manual. It is a timeless classic, which many purportedly famous names have yet to excel. Some reviewers may criticise the quality of the book's binding (the 1976 one may be called average, but not bad) or the author's grammatical or syntactical proclivities and \\"lack of soulfullness\\" (I honestly don't know what that implies!) or, even what I see as a slightly blunt moralising overtone of \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" - but such criticisms are immature and irrelevant, and detract from the author's actual work. Everybody has their own way of approaching and interacting with even the best books, and should therefore not expect a book to be 100% satisfying beforehand, without reconciling its content with their own mature judgement in some way.	2005-09-10

But this is the last I will get. Sydney Omarr himself died in the first week of 2003, and the books appearing thereafter as \\"authored\\" under his name actually use it as a registered trademark (with a craftily small \\"R\\" beside it). Therefore these books are not written by him, but \\"ghostwritten\\" by Trish MacGregor. Now the 2004 and 2005 books still contained genuine material by him, put together by Carol Tonsing, as he had probably written these delineations in advance. But now that that has run out, the writing is very much unlike Omarr's, naturally, and doesn't contain his original insights and ingenuity, or even have his style. It would be nothing short of cheating to call this his work - inspite of the trademark laws' permission to use it. Trish MacGregor should be more honest and publish her work under her own name, and if she wishes to be as ingenuous as Omarr she should develop her own mastery, which requires time. Omarr's name should be buried respectfully with him, as is the norm. Nothing lasts continuously.	2005-09-10

That is evident if one reads this book. This is an excellent introduction to the technical aspects of astrology such as its basic mathematical calculations, but that is all. And that is NOT what astrology is \\"all about\\". I would advise the novice reader to treat it as such, instead of regarding it as a complete introduction to the subject where one really \\"gets the hang\\" of it.

It is a serious, easy to read, no-nonsense primer, which at the same time acquaints the novice with the actual philiosophy behind the subject in the form of concise delineations, and that is what is really important. More than that, it is also devoid of the mumbo-jumbo which many use to try and \\"spice up\\" and mystify an otherwise very real art, and which has ended up in discrediting it and making it a laughing stock.

This is an extremely eloquent and comprehensive book on related issues, caused by and central to the fate of modern civilisation, which are just now beginning to make themselves felt, all at once: Oil (and other natural resource)depletion, climate change and global warming, global ecological disaster plus the fiercely relentless consumerism that charaterises nowaday's \\"postmodern\\" capitalism (which is its final stage, too...)The book gives a scholarly, if somewhat forceful presentation of its case and all that goes with it. Kunstler's narrative is skilled but somewhat coarse, being laced with the abuse, swearwords and informalism that usually characterise modern American English and writing - its \\"beauty\\", as one commentator recently put it - though not every American author I have read suffers notably from this flaw. But then Kunstler himself comes across as a coarse man, so this is also his true expresssion. In addition, having said this, there is also another fault I find in Kunstler's work inspite of its excellence: the man shows up in his basic outlook as a crude American imperialist type (or \\"neocon\\"), which is a contradiction in terms of this book and its subject matter. In other words, he espouses the same kind of attitudes that led to this kind of situation in the first place - which he laments in his book. That is why I rate it at three stars.<br /><br />Whatever the personal drawbacks of the man Kunstler himself, his book ably demonstrates to the intelligent reader that no revolution or socialistic ideology could ever have put paid to the evil menace of capitalism, so totally, so neatly and with such effortless finality as Peak Oil - the supreme natural instrument and enabler of global justice for humanity as well as its planet.

Even the limited, \\"specialist scale\\" awareness of it has only begun to dawn widely only in the last 2-3 years, especially in the aftermath of 9/11 leading upto the Iraq war, followed by rising oil prices. This book is a concise primer, among all the others of its ilk, that describes the nature of Peak Oil fully and clearly and its character. Heinberg does do justice here in describing its full list of implications, however I do feel that they could be stated more clearly. Peak Oil will mark an unprecedented catastrophe in thev history of the human civilisation of the present, especially in its vanguard, that is the developed countries. It has no antidote either. Oil depletion is a complete cataclysm, total in every respect, because oil forms the lifeblood of postmodern civilisation as we know it: the glamorous, advanced and yet predatory imperialist capitalist setup that has existed since the USA rose to world power after World War 2, and then defeated communism after a 47 year long \\"cold war\\" to become the world's sole arbiter. Peak Oil is welcome news, because it will bring about the utter downfall of America and the West and their system. These societies will be the hardest hit. Peak Oil is the only means that can effectively release the rest of the world from the otherwise hopeless situation of the monstrous stranglehold of the West and its relentless, greedy exploitation of the world's resources for its own thoughtless and fanatic hedonism. The postmodern, globalised West could have used its gift of surplus wealth and techno-cultural marvels to help upgrade the rest of humanity's condition, as was its primary moral responsibility. But because corporatism is immoral in that it is solely geared to base selfishness, the West prostituted its gains, by supporting their Third World crony elites' extreme and debilitating corruption, coupled with ridiculously wasteful consumerism at home. Had Peak Oil not come, this vicious cycle would have continued relentlessly, pushing the world to total chaos, war and ecological disaster till it seized up in despair and destructed itself irreparably. In this sense, Peak Oil - the grim reaper and equaliser - will deliver us in time and give us salvation by ensuring our survival, even if on a less glamorous level.

It was our forebears, who in previous advanced epochs now remembered only in myth, left their mark elsewhere in this solar system besides earth. Goodness knows whence we originally came; but the all-pervasive hold on human mass-emotion and behaviour by supposedly \\"primitive\\" and \\"irrational\\" mythology, sacred scriptures and \\"illogical\\" traditions shows something deeper and hidden - that collective legacy of ours. He distills the diverse and complex strands of UFO lore, conspiracy theories, Freemasonry, Atlantis/ancient civilisations, ancient astronauts, fairies and superbeings, angels and devils, the Old Testament, and New World as well as Oriental and European folklores into one clear and very logical essence. or so I see.

The consequences, as Shattruck points out, are there for all who \\"have ears to hear and eyes to see\\" - to contemplate. But then the only probable alternative, the suggestion of keeping reality and profound knowledge \\"in place\\" and secure at the level where it really belongs and has always been - will be unpopular to say the least, and go against the grain of nowaday's populist and democratic Western freedom of expression and knowledge tendencies: such arcane knowledge can never be eliminated, but should be the domain of a certain level (\\"elite\\") of people, who by virtue of training, experience, initiation or divinity, are strong enough to possesss it without it unbalancing them and overturning the conventional reality the \\"normal\\" world always runs on. Its possession is a grat responsibility and gift. In turn, it should be put to regulated use for the greatest benefit of society, which is the job of such people to guide, as possession of this knowledge results in great strength. That is what knowledge, like medicine, is for: use. But not abuse. Now this suggestion of universal truth and wisdom will be met with accusations of \\"elitism\\" against me, even \\"Illuminism\\" and \\"Masonism\\" and whatever nowaday's eager \\"conspiratorialists\\" have in their lexicon. Precisely. I think Roger Shattruck has done a service in writing and publishing this book - but he should keep this inevitable corrolary which I have highlighted - in mind, too. Proper use and abuse of the power derived from the strength given by such knowledge is a separate issue, and is often confused. In fact its proper management could spell the difference between a \\"Golden\\" social era and a dark one. Nowaday's developed-world elites are certainy corrupted and evil, and irresponsible as to their social obligations; they are living in exactly such a dark age - and need excision to save the world - but that doesn't mean at all that elites were always so, or that the institution of elitism is always socially obnoxious, irrelevant and evil.ations of \\"elitism\\" against me, even \\"Illuminism\\" and \\"Masonism\\" and whatever nowaday's eager \\"conspiratorialists\\" have in their lexicon.

That objective has been accomplished, but the US has ended up with a nightmare of an enemy that is far more harmful exponentially than the Soviet \\"threat\\" ever could have been. Afghanistan lies trashed beyond repair, while Pakistan is well on the way to becoming one of the world's most dangerous failed states. The book is an excellent read, however I do not agree with the author's attempt to distinguish US created \\"political Islam\\" from \\"normal/everyday Islam\\"; the Americans just amplified and fuelled the abominable, rigid characteristics latent in the very corpus of Islam itself to turn it into a formidable Frankenstein. As a former Muslim having been brought up and still living here in the Islamic world, I know that not only scholastically, but also from personal experience! Any regional variations in Islamic culture that can be described as moderations are in fact just that, dilutions of the original doctrine by the local milieu, and not vice versa. I give this book a five star rating on account of its rendering of the chronicle of events, not the author's opinions.	2005-01-24

Though many won't realise in these turbulent times, this is an extremely crucial book of its time, for both Americans and every understanding person on this planet.<br /><br />Michael Ruppert rightly terms the USA as an empire. It is in fact The Evil Empire, an epithet which the late great Ronald Reagan very artfully coined and employed to frame the Soviet Union with, in the eyes of the world. Now many ordinary American citizens are also starting to realise this, but even though as the finale for the current global scenario draws close, the majority seems confused and manipulated as George W. Bush's re-election demonstrates.<br /><br />This empire (together with its many local vassals and proxies such as the anglophone robber elite ruler-class of Pakistan) is self-ruinous, as Ruppert demonstrates, destroying the prospects of its own future together with those of the rest of the entire world. Michael Ruppert's book shows that an empire of such dimensions, with such global and technological reach as the USA - unprecedented in recorded history - will only end up in wreaking wholesale destruction if its power continues to be used primarily in the service of its selfish greed. But unfortunately, as Ruppert makes clear, the \\"Point of No Return\\" in that regard seems to have been reached already, quite a while ago...<br /><br />This book employs a simple, elegant prose in its rendition, which makes it pleasureable to read. This is a rarity in an age when most American and other current writing is couched in foul-mouthed slang of one or another variety, and/or it characteristically employs the excessive use of hype and highflown jargon. We find no such pollutants here. For this, I commend the author.	2005-01-02

Books such as this present crucial, unpleasant evidence that can no longer be avoided, dismissed or compromised on whatsoever.<br />The content of Steve Coll's book is built upon useful minutiae and his narrative is qualitatively better and more reasonable than that of other key books appearing on the subject so far.<br />It is again evident from this book - as also from its other predecessors - that America's criminal marriage of convenience with fanatical barbarous murderous thugs and bigots, plus abetting them - to achieve her &quot;righteous&quot; 1991 victory is more vile than any silly old &quot;gray&quot; Communist dogma (that was decaying anyway) could ever be. From the material Coll has compiled in this book, it is apparent to any reasonable scholar of the subject that the kind of vile trickery and hypocritical facades, together with this vast undercover war that America employed to achieve world domination (not just the victory of &quot;free enterprise&quot; over communism) merits that America doesn't deserve a civilised enemy as Communism was, but that  the sort of intangible nightmarish horror presented by militant/revivalist Islam is the right kind of nemesis for this greedy, arrogant world bully that supports (and revives) the Third World's feudal and tribal social status quo and enables massive elitist corruption in those countries, and treats the world as its playground like a spoilt child.<br />As a dweller of the key Pakistani North Western border city of Peshawar (mentioned throughout this book), who suffered the effects of and witnessed first-hand more or less all the shameful goings on which Steve Coll has documented - happening in my close proximity, all I will say is this: Congratulations, America, you've won your Cold War but you've really earned yourself a nice fix, too, in the process ...

The occurence of September 11 2001 was not only a direct result of certain Western actions and policies, but a warning for all modern civilisation as a whole. It was the direct outcome of the West's active support and later its foolish complacency regarding the backward but extremely potent phenomenon of Islamic radicalism and its associated redundant feudal and tribal socio-cultural base structures in Pakistan, Afghanistan and most of the Middle East, which are the most widespread and well entrenched of such anachronisms still extant on this planet, that are decidedly medieval. They owe their continued unnatural existence and integrity in this &quot;postmodern&quot; age solely to Western help and support. The main reason of this post WW2 and mainly American support was for the West to contain and eventually defeat its fellow modern yet rival Marxist Soviet Bloc and the USSR. At the time that this support reached its critical phase in the 1980s, the Soviet state was itself in a state of advanced metamorphosis, and was inevitably bound to &quot;peter out&quot; into something better and more moderate had it been left to its own dynamics. But the greedy -- and naive --American arrogance that led the West knew no decent bounds. The result is the &quot;post-9/11&quot; world we see today, that took over from the pyrrhic Western triumphalism of the &quot;post Cold-War&quot; era which lasted a decade after the Soviet Union fell in.<br />This sad occurence of Western support for Islamic backwardness was, to use a Biblical term, literally a disgraceful &quot;defilement&quot; of all modern ideals, an action disgracefully contrary to the general direction and character of modern civilisation and all that it stands for. It was a product of inconsiderate lustful greed, with consequences just as evil.<br />But it seems that inspite of the blow of 9/11, the Americans are yet to get over their vice of freewheeling cockiness. One just has to look at the way the author of this book, George Crile, writes so admiringly and eulogistically about his decidely criminal and dissolute hero Sen. Charlie Wilson and his character. Wilson was a key figure in this sordid drama apart from the prominent Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher duo.

I am left shocked and disgusted at the likes of Charlie Wilson and George Crile and how little Americans know or care, amidst their prosperity and freedom, about the world in which they live. And then these people wonder indignantly at how events like 9/11 strike them and why.<br />The only thing I like about this book is that it is a blow-by-blow account, the most detailed I have seen, written in ordinary language about America's biggest &quot;covert&quot; operation and blunder -- of how it revived and nurtured and financed the decrepit extremist and fundamentalist tendencies of Islam and its tribal-feudal remnants, as well as high level all-engulfing corruption &quot;culture&quot; and warlordism in the region the 1980s and 90s by readily pouring in billions of dollars in cash and state-of-the-art weapons to a society and ideology which would have made even the Vikings look modern.

I ask all civilised people to read this highly disgusting yet extremely useful document and then introspect deeply on things today, how they got there and what the future holds for the doers of such misdeeds, and what needs to be done to clean it all up.	2004-02-19

(In fact, this is a direct extension of the West's cultivation of militant Islamist extremism as its cold war weapon against the USSR while it was engaged in reforming Afghanistan). But not only Saudi Arabia, this description can also be extended to apply to similar other key Western &quot;allies&quot; in the region such as Pakistan, which together with Afghanistan and even &quot;liberated&quot; Central Asia now club together to form one huge perilous festering &quot;national&quot; cesspool of irreversible and terminal social collapse and dysfunctionality in the region -- a horrendous Pandora's Box waiting for the future to unravel it, in the face of Westward victims who may deserve such an onslaught after all, given that they had nurtured it in the beginning for use on others...<br />Books such as this one by Robert Baer are a worthy testimony to the consequences of the rise 55 years ago of the USA to superpower status, and the inevitable destructive legacy it has left the future with...<br />No doubt, history will highlight the fact that it was the US-West axis which deliberately supported and cultivated the mess of corruption and backwardness in this region's societies at a critical time, for their dirty tactical purposes till it backfired on them in 2001.

We all know where that led to, yet in all the hype we hear in the current war being waged on terror, this basic fact is muted most shamelessly...<br />Over half a century of US-Western &quot;neocolonial&quot; policy has reduced most Middle Eastern and South Asian societies, notably Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and Pakistan besides Afghanistan, into the crucibles of an incurable and intractable malignancy which now threatens modern civilisation more audaciously and effectively than Soviet ICBMs ever could. Although the US-West managed to keep these areas out of the &quot;Soviet orbit&quot;, stated simply, they have got something far worse now...<br />The US-Western &quot;war on terror&quot; effort can't simply be construed as the crushing of al-Qaeda as it is often deliberately made out to be. I wish it was that simple, but it isn't. It isn't merely a matter of destroying an elusive al-Qaeda or catching Bin Laden to put on trial for the amount of people he has killed (Americans of course, not the Soviets he killed when he was a good guy); It is now actually a matter of dealing with whole societies where corrupt attitudes, cynicism, and backward religious and cultural extremism course through the veins of their wretched masses as normally as motor cars do through prosperous Western streets. And the US knows that.<br />The US may be foremost among the nations of modern civilisation, but it doesn't deserve to bear the mantle of its leadership or lay claim to it after what it has done.

Kaplan is one of the most astute of all American writers and analysts I have ever come across.<br />His book, \\"Warrior Politics\\" is one among a series of no-nonsense realist books written by him concerning world affairs, highlighting an approach rarely found in today's \\"politically correct\\" world. The theme of \\"Warrior Politics\\" revolves around the dangerous and unpleasant situation the world faces from ramshackle and rundown states and societies, which now face no really plausible future but utter destruction of some form. These societies span most of the Middle East region, together with Pakistan and Afghanistan. The author's basic argument is (for the US led West) to interact with these not in the high standard manner that western norms are accustomed to, but to recognise these entities and their cultures for what they really are, and come across to them in terms of their own image of themselves - which might be radically different from, or at odds with western morality. This is the \\"pagan \\" approach he talks about. Personally, I agree whole heartedly with this method. Whether we like it or not, this state of affairs exists, and it has to be effectively acknowledged. For those who accuse Kaplan of \\"ethnocentricity\\", I would vouch that this is a dangerously misconcieved, nonsensical liberalist fallacy, a term coined by those far removed from serious and diverse global realities, who haven't really seen or don't regard them duly. There ARE superior and inferior societies in the world; we can not wish that away. What differentiates this argument from the obnoxious \\"redneck\\" ideology is that we must keep our intentions clean, and strive to bring the whole world upto the best global standards possible. And all know what those are, and WHERE they lie... Kaplan's approach, as detailed here, is the only logical method people at the helm can really hope to follow.<br />But it is here that I come to the second facet of this argument, and that is as important - if not more than - what I have just said: The only hypocrisy I can accuse Kaplan and his ilk of--and this is as fundamental a reality as the content of \\"Warrior Politics\\" and all of Kaplan's works--is the fact that the American state and society to which they belong and work for, has for the past 50 plus years of US world ascendancy, fully nurtured and supported the robber ruling elites of these failed, rogue societies--without which these elites couldn't have survived much less have exercised their pernicious influence. These elites and their behaviour held the key to the future and fate of these doomed societies before they became terminally \\"critical\\" and the source of global disaster. This is a very, very grave historical charge, the main charge of the era, which is likely to be held and pursued against the USA and its ruling administrations in the near future not by bin Ladens and extremist Muslims and criminals, but by desparate civilised people such as myself.

It can be regarded as the magnum opus of its subject. The main merit of the book lies in the fact that its presents a detailed genealogical history, as well as a narrative of the area, its places, language and dialects, and culture of this race - with valuable first hand background information by a scholarly author who was also the top colonial administrator of this area, having reached that position after a long record of lesser tier appointments and experience in the same place. And nobody then or since, has attempted another such work in any language concerning this crucial and extremely troublesome race, whose region is now a crucible of turbulence. One of the book's chief drawbacks is that it dates to the time period of 50-60 years ago, and given the nature of 20th century developments, not just \\"water\\" alone but a whole ocean has flowed under the bridge since then, to modify the cliche realistically. Also the narrative of its writer is heavily tinted with his own maudlin emotional sentiments and rose tinted romanticism--and he has acknowledged these feelings openly while describing to the reader the nature of his book in the preface--therefore this aspect of the book robs it of any credibility in presenting the reader with the actual picture as it obtains on the ground, especially nowadays. After all, analysing a society doesn't wholly depend on facts and figures concerning what its inhabitants eat or wear, or the group its language belongs to. Even emotional involvements must be seen as to whether they are deluded or appropriate. So, as a reviewer, let me take up on the subject of this book where its British imperialist officer, yet somewhat giggolo-like author, fails. The Pathans are perhaps the most criminal society on the face of the planet nowadays and have been for since long. The people are extremely proud and boastful about their negative \\"dangerous\\" qualities, extremely jealous, grasping and malintentioned, bellicose and vindictive and can nurse the pettiest of slights and grudges for years, ending in explosive results. When the British ruled here for a century, there was a semblance of order and justice, but after 1947 the area quickly started reverting to its protean tribal lawlessness, and following the Afghan revolutionary upheavals of 1978 the reversion was complete, if not more intense than ever before. Government exists here only as a verneer on paper; even that is made up of the obsolete rules the British colonialists had drawn up. Those \\"elders\\" in power and authority are bandits and things get done through favour and patronage and contacts. Nobody is ashamed of this. For a Pathan, its \\"normal living\\". Drugs and smuggling make up their economy, robbing the state treasury makes up their top officials' salaries and no taxes are paid. Of course, when the top dogs indulge themselves thus, everybody else feels they have a right to do the same, here... There is no public or civic life, and one's safety and survival are dependent on the jungle law, survival of the fittest (or the cunning). Public works suffer for lack of money or planning. \\"Justice\\" is meted out by informal gatherings of toughs and \\"social influentials\\" known as \\"jirgas\\".  Thus the place is rundown and ramshackle like an American frontier town's scenario from the 19th century Wild West, where rude, boorish macho tribesmen rule the day. It is the home base of the Taliban and Islamic extremist terrorism. Here the only women you can be relaxed with are your mother and sisters. Sex is only \\"permissible\\" in marriage, and for that you have to send a party of relatives over to a person's house to choose and \\"reserve\\" his daughter for you. If a man tries meeting a \\"stranger\\" female normally, he and the woman risk getting shot dead by her father/brother(s)/cousin(s) for violating their family's \\"honour\\". (Women here, you see, are objects of honour for their tribe and family. They are there only to be given or sold to husbands at their males' liking. With due apologies to gays, Pathan men are normally bisexual, and society doesn't bat an eyelid about it).  The police treats such killings as \\"honour killing\\" between the two parties involved, and leaves it to a \\"jirgah\\" to mete \\"justice\\", usually settled by payment of blood money or yet another forced marriage, known as \\"swarrah\\". Of course in reality, Pathan women are among the most oversexed and \\"hottest\\", but all liaisions are strictly \\"underground\\". I was born a Pathan - from Charsadda district - and because of various constraints am still living here. But in spirit, I'm a normal human being, not a Pathan. In short, this is a society beyond redemption. The Pathan spirit refuses to change in any aspect. And they try to prevent others from doing so to, who want to change. This society truly merits the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) to wipe it cleanly and efficiently off the face of the earth as a sevice to the ideals of normal, modern civilisation. And I think one day in the near future, responsible leaders will be forced to take that path out of dire necessity. But at the moment, this evil blot on the globe continues to exist just because America and the West support it, and don't give a damn about how bad its people are.

US	51356412	R2HD3XSRT0VOF3	0312216068	21296657	Pakistan: A Modern History	Books	3	19	37	N	N	Some additional information for a good book.	I have read this book, always optimistic in the hope that I will come across even better accounts on this much misunderstood subject, but sadly that is a wish that remains unfulfilled after many long years. Ian Talbot has meticulously documented and provided scholastic information that will otherwise be useful and handy for students and interested readers alike, but I--for one--would like to add through this review, a synopsis of what I feel he has left out. This concerns the crux of what needs to be sorely known about Pakistan's basic realities.<br />Pakistan is definitely in many ways a historical &quot;stepchild&quot; of India, whose creation is owed to some complex situations evolved in India due to extensive invasions from its Northwestern side, and the arrival of Islam here through those invasions. Unlike other &quot;standard&quot; nation states of the modern era, however, Pakistan is enveloped in an aura of artificiality. This is not simply because of the fact that it was carved &quot;artificially&quot; out of India on the demand of one man for apparently fudgy reasons; but<br />this artificiality is more apparent in the fact that when its 54 year history is studied, Pakistan is seen as a state which seems to exist primarily in order to fulfill the predatory aims of its ruling elite classes, unlike most other countries in the world. (This elite has been rated as among the most rapacious by the world's premier anti-corruption think-tanks and watchdog bodies). The prime reason of this elite's existence and rule of the Pakistani state all along has been corruption and misappropriation of wealth for their own enjoyment. It was for this reason that they lost East Pakistan, which became Bangladesh in 1971 after a landmark struggle. Then, they have literally been using Afghanistan as an unofficial &quot;backyard&quot; of theirs since 1992, after it had endured 14 years of ravages due to the Soviet intervention there and prolonged civil war. And they have been fuelling the fires of war and terrorism in neighbouring Kashmir since 1989 especially--and have &quot;adopted&quot; it as their &quot;cause&quot;--not out of any conviction about Kashmiri independence, but to focus attention there and to have something &quot;to live for&quot; in order to keep their topsy-turvy and unnatural system alive and going. In other words, they thrive not on a fair social base or development, but on mischief and destruction. This speaks volumes for their true nature, to the incisive analyst.<br />In all of this, and in fact for their lifeblood and their existence, this elite of bandit rulers has been parasitically dependent wholly and solely on the largesse and aid of America and Western Europe--which was fuelled by the formers' own greedy and myopic motives. In the '80s and '90s of the past century, this elite acted shamelessly as the willing sycophants and henchmen for America's dirty games against the USSR and progressive governments in the region. Now when that Islamic terrorism and atmosphere of corruption sponsored here by the US and its allies have finally begun to backfire on them, the &quot;poor&quot; Pakistani ruling classes are out in the dark cold night, between the devil and the deep blue sea. They deserve it, for the nature of their character and what they have done. I would like to remind Mr. Talbot that no authoritative history of Pakistan would otherwise be complete without an unfazed judgement on its ruling elites. They are a blot on the face of the earth.<br />Another valuable differentiation which I feel that Talbot has not pointed out with the analysis needed, is that from among the four main nationalities which constitute Pakistan, the Pathans (Pukhtuns) are the most offensive. In fact, their cultural mores proudly &quot;sanctify&quot; criminal practices and lawless attitudes, by backing them with the sanction of custom and tradition. The Punjabi nationality are in the majority, but the copying of Pathan behaviour is regardedby them as a matter of prestige.them as a matter of prestige.	2001-10-02

From what I can see of his writings, John Hogue is among the best exponents on millenialism and related subjects, in the current set of writers. This is an overwhelmingly important issue, the &quot;feeling&quot; of which is generally building up in collective human conciousness. This book deals with a key aspect of millenialism itself, messianism. Retribution and punishment, especially of wayward people is a concept as old as human thought itself. No matter how technological Man and his society may get, God will always be there, and so will the concept of justice. One need not subscribe formally to any religion in order to &quot;beleive&quot; in God, though it goes without saying that among existing religions, some are better than others, and this is reflected in the state of their societies in general: their culture, science, and political and economic spheres.  However, there are those who may be good in many, or in the majority of, respects. But they will have to suffer destruction--and then reconstitution and flourishing again--because of some erroneous &quot;glitch&quot; of theirs that they might have overlooked or underestimated. In the case of nowaday's &quot;glittering&quot; West, they had an obligation not to do what they have done; not to dash ahead selfishly and carelessly, not to allow or nurture the existence and efficiency of bad elites as are now found existing in the less fortunate parts of the world.  And as for the backward civilisations of the world, they are coming to an end: because they are outdated and yet cherish it. But they will be perpetuators of the agression against the wayward developed ones,  getting consumed in this process. That is what millenialism is all about, in the correct perception.	2001-01-21

It also contains many name-spelling and minor contextual mistakes and errors throughout. People such as him do no service to the historical reality of a very profound and key situation of the present era of the world. For one, they blame the Soviet invasion of 1979 for events in Afganistan since then. That is untrue. What the invasion did was to precipitate this crisis, but as far as its causes are concerned, among other things, the character of the Afghan nature and society are wholly responsible and should be addressed and exposed by concerned writers. The underpinnings of this crisis had started well before 1979, and this is what could have been expected to have transpired because of the rigid and vicious nature of Afghan society when it encountered social, technological and cultural progress of any kind. The pseudo-science of Marxism wasn't at all the ideal solution to anything, but Western writers should refrain from using its defeat as a scapegoat or whipping post to hide their own weaknesses and/or mask their own doings which, since 1991 especially, are almost equal in magnitude to Marxist fallacies and wrongs.  Expert observers will note that both Islam and Marxian communist politics, though diametrically opposed, struck a very resonant chord somewhere deep in the sinister murkiness of the Afghan psyche. (And this isn't quite the &quot;communism&quot; any Europeans are used to knowing). I hate &quot;my&quot; people for their nature. History will remember them for the rascals and wolves that they are...yes, indeed.	2001-01-15

How very true is his assessment, indeed! Yet how craftily put, too, because the main cause for the spread of this dark age and its attitudes of materialism, greed, corruption and apathy has been none other than his own country, the biblical &quot;Babylon&quot; of the United States of America. He has been equally artful throughout this book in twisting--and/or glossing over the facts that would aportion the actual responsibility for this outcome on the actors of the global stage at the present time. This he has done with the characteristic vagueness and fudging typical of the western writers of the time, which will confuse most readers as to the true nature of this topic of central importance. This is his aim, no doubt, and it can have no benefits. Similar decadent situations have oft existed in history, such as the one of Rome on the eve of its mauling at the hands of the Vandals. (Read &quot;the US&quot; vs.&quot;Islam&quot; for the present scenario). But even in ages such as our present vulgarly touted age of &quot; unprecedented technology, information, enlightenment and global(istic) prosperity&quot;, the import of all such historical lessons seems hard to come by.....<br />Unfortunately there is no effective way of intercepting the careless, apathetic West and its righteously naive &quot;liberalist&quot; individualism and excessive consumerism: the runaway extravagance they call &quot;deveopment&quot;--except for a worldwide fundamentalist Islamic conflagration which is imminent. No matter how loathsome in its character this might be (and actually is), at this fateful juncture it is the only bitter pill capable of fixing the West and its key Third world elitist cronies who have a grip on the world unto death; it is just what &quot;the doctor ordered&quot;. During the last 50 years or so, the West has mercilessly kept up with its &quot;development&quot;, not only at the cost of others, but also to the detriment of its own integrity. It doesn't wish to proceed cautiously or look back in this regard. Such driven attitudes are as bad as the fanatical reactionism and callously evil outlook that characterise Islam, the West's most dangerous enemy (I should know, for I am a &quot;muslim&quot;). The West has, since 1991 at least, vigorously eliminated any other more &quot;civil&quot; alternative to its foolishness, such as Marxism, which would have transformed and improved, had it been left to its own course. (Although I don't subscribe to its orthodox version in particular). What use are the benefits of Western science and technology and development when they have become an end in themselves, and have acquired an unsavoury momentum of their own ? (And what use are they when the intent to promote them is basically corrupt?) The West has overshadowed all such benefits through its runaway greed, apathy and naivete and cloistered cockiness. They arrogantly don't want to believe anything about the nature of their &quot;progress&quot;, other than what they wish to see, in their confident tunnel-vision, and in doing so have foreclosed the possibility of having &quot;a place to fall back on&quot; if things go wrong, as they have started to. It is too late now to do anything but to face and start understanding the consequences. Just as the nature and the concepts of their progress are extreme, so will they face an extreme backlash, in the form of a now powerfully charged and agressive Islam.

Its common people aren't worth the faeces they make: they allow tyrants to play around with them, their rights and their fate, and let them rob them openly. It is only when such people emigrate to Western societies that they manage to find some self-worth. This proves the hollowness of their claim to legitimacy, and tells us that they are an inert, spent culture fit for destruction only, since they can not manage to better their lot in their own societies and lands where they really belong, on their own. Anybody who has the guts to point out such basic realities in today's strayed-off-the-path world, promptly gets labelled as a &quot;racist&quot;. These &quot;immigrants&quot; have the nerve to leave their own failing societies by hook or by crook and parasitically latch on to their Western host societies. When they find enough breath after recovering, they start extolling the virtues of Islam, and denigrating their hosts' culture. If they were so much in love with their own religion and culture, why did it need the &quot;enemy&quot; Western environment for them to be able to express their true sentiments? Instead why didn't they stay behind in their own country where such circumstances truly belong and freely prevail? (This basic discrepancy is often overlooked by Westerners due to &quot;political correctness&quot;). Such pestilent, deceitful types need to be eradicated. On the other hand, the Pakistani ruling classes are among the largest and the worst organised crime syndicates in the world (and America knows this very well). There are many who would like to fudge the truth about these matters for various reasons, but I am a Pakistani, well versed in the affairs of where I live, and nobody can contest the veracity of my assertions.	2000-12-15

It illustrates very well the (my)  contention that the bourgeois/middle class/modern cultures have long since  supersded the state of affairs prevailing--and decaying--in Pakistan's  society and culture today; and that this contorted &quot;system&quot; could  not exist here without the active support of first the British and now  America, which helps it live on artificially, and  has confined bourgeois  reality unfairly to the (feudal) minority elite of this social setup, whose  people are inert, uneducated and passive (even if they were capable of  overthrowing this setup, they could not replace it with anything but chaos.  They need &quot;help from above&quot;). So the elites end up in enjoying  &quot;the best&quot; of &quot;both worlds&quot;, while the poor writhe on  in their self inflicted wretchedness. Of course this doesn't mean that  tension and explosive disintegration are not present. It is just that the  &quot;masses&quot; don't know the right way to go about asserting  themselves. They are more inclined to view things in the &quot;two wrongs  make a right&quot; manner. Apart from all this, the basis for the existence  of the reality of the Pakistani entity is nonsensical and ridiculous, being  put together like something out of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.The  nature of its name reflects that.	2000-09-10

Were I to write an account on this subject today, it would hardly differ  from Churchill's. His opinions are still very much valid, and those who  value truthful methods of analysis are well aware of this. This book must  not be spurned by experts.

As an example of the above, in  its chapter on Islamic pronouncements on sexual affairs, it reports and  comments on the matter in an extensive way, with a most dispassionate  scholasticism, especially regarding the prophet's sexuality and  preferences. In doing that, it is doing something rare, yet utterly needing  doing: That the man himself, whatever else he may have been, was also  merely a human being, subject to human characteristics, not the  unreachable, glittering, profound, glorious symbol of utterly complete  perfection &quot;for all times and all men&quot; that Muslims have made him  out to be, with such fierce conviction. Of course, the truth of the matter  is that most Muslims themselves privately laugh at and violate such notions  without a second thought in the conduct of their daily lives, especially  nowadays; the reasons for the strong public/social presence of such notions  is more deep and sinister, having more to do with the social nature of  these people, and their treatment towards each other.	2000-08-18

It can be called a magnum opus. The narrative of its writer is, of course, tinted heavily with his own emotion--and he has pointed this out to the reader himself when describing the nature of his book--therefore this aspect of the book may also be taken as a &quot;historical reference&quot;, to its VIP author's attitudes, but otherwise has no value and is sincere, but very harmfully misleading to the unacquainted reader, about the true nature of the evil Pathan society and its ways, in the present time especially. The Pathans/Pakhtuns/Afghans were always a backward, turbulent society with a criminal culture, but they have changed drastically for the worse in the 44 years since this book was first written, mostly in the last 20 years or so.	2000-08-18

There is always a substantial  body of unexplained and mystifying information in human existence, and this  is often of a nature that withstands the sharpness of the attacks, at  explaining it, by the current sceptics or &quot;experts&quot; of the age.  The result is that it then passes on into folklore or legend, which in no  way  affects the character or appeal of such information. This holds true  whether the age is of high technology, as at present, or that of the horse  and cart--which is still extant in many parts of the world. This book is  just one classic and well carried out attempt at trying to meaningfully  codify and explain such phenomena.	2000-06-27

It is a good book, dealing with a perfectly plausible subject. But his is the typical conspiracy theory of well-fed, easy going, ill-informed and gullible Western (rather New World)  populations, who have been made insular by their prosperity. I would like  to point out a more down-to-Earth yet equally serious conspiracy for which  solid proof is easily accessible all around, yet to the discerning eye. The  short resume of this situation is: the installation by Western elites of  client parasite ruling elites in the &quot;Third&quot; world, and the use  of them to take unfair advantage of prevalent indigenous conditions to keep  the channel of exploitation open. Of course, this state of affairs may be  too boring for the kind of gushing cospiracy theorists in question, for it  is too heavy and &quot;everyday&quot; to serve their glamorous needs. But  it is precisely these escapist attitudes which are going to dangerously  destabilise the future of the world, if people don't wake up and become  wise. If Western populations, among whom the &quot;leading&quot; ones are  the North Americans, don't care to bother about the hard facts on the  ground by continuing to make soap operas, baseball leagues, stock markets  and rock concerts the main focus of their activity, then they not only  deserve, but NEED to have the kind of elitism and control measures that Jim  Marrs and others like him allege.	2000-05-24

It is strange, is it not, that Western books and authors such as this use unusually strong language when referring to Marxism and Communism. Although I am not a communist, and I detest the notion of being one , I equally  detest the righteous &quot;goody- goody&quot; hypocrisy, used by the West  to combat it. To put it short, the West is guilty of doing many things that  they despised the communists for, even worse, in the period of the  &quot;New World Order&quot;. Not all such accusations belong to the  paranoid underworld of conspiracy theorists. They have  supported some of  the most shamelessly corrupt and wretched client regimes in the world, such  as Zia-ul-Haq and Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan,  the murderous Guatemalan  regimes, the Shah of Iran, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, the Arab Sheikdoms,  to name but a few...They were responsible for the creation of the Taliban  terror of Afghanistan, which is now one of the biggest thorns in their  side. Nine years after gaining ascendancy in the world, the West's  so-called reforms and ruthless robber capitalism have trashed and  impoverished Russian society, despite their theorists' assertions and  assurances to the contrary. This is what this book, and others like it,  smell strongly of.	2000-05-20
