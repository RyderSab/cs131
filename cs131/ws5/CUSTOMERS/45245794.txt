The Characters are well developed, but a bit far fetched, and the plots are a bit unbelievable.  Even after all this I don't think it is a bad read.  The story moves very quickly and is a page turner, it is not like you are getting bored throughout the book.  I still am a fan and we will see as the series grows it may get better, there is a lot of room for that.<br /> Max and Dee Dee are back from Full House, twenty years later.

I just started it, going from A up.

But somewhere in between, she simply vanished in thin air. Kinsey's case goes from puzzling to baleful when a house is torched, an apartment is burglarized of nothing but worthless papers, the lynx coat comes back in the picture without it's owner Elaine. Then Elaine's bridge partner is found dead. <br />What you have is murder and plenty of it in this novel.  It was a very fast read and I am really growing fond of Kinsey.

I have just started this series but I really enjoyed this book.  The mystery keeps pages turning as it intriguing, suspenseful and a real fast read.  The character Kinsey is very independent, you feel as you now know her and she is portrayed as somebody you do know.<br /> Nikki Fife has just been released from prison after doing 8 years for the murdering her husband, Laurence.  Nikki wants Kinsey to find the person who really killed Laurence.  Kinsey begins to investigate and  finds out about another murder committed only days after Laurence's that is extremely similar. The victim was the accountant for Laurence's law firm, Libby Glass, and she was killed using an identical method of poisoning. This trail is 8-years-old and Kinsey knows it won't be easy to find the truth.<br /> Kinsey begins to put together a picture of the people involved and the circumstances that lead up to Laurence's murder. But somebody is not too pleased with Kinsey investigating and unveiling facts that could lead to the true murderer.  Kinsey gets herself into danger, and as she struggles to put the pieces together, someone is trying to stop her. <br /> Grafton does a great job with the suspense and \\"who done it \\" in this book. Makes you ready for more of Kinsey Millhone.  The book was a fun, simple read that I managed in an evening.  You don't want to miss this one and I have a feeling they will get addictive.	2003-06-11

I love Nora Roberts work and I am always amazed by the quality to the number of books she cranks out a year.  I really have to say she has out done herself this year as I think this was one of her best books yet.  I also felt this way about her last \\"In Death \\" installment to her mystery series written as J. D. Robb.  This book was a thriller all the way though, turning the pages and not wanting to put the book down.<br />In a mall around Christmas time a mother rushes to her three year old son who is scared of Santa.  She turns back and her three month old daughter is gone!  28 years later this mother is watching TV and she sees her daughter. DR Callie Dunbrook, who is an archeologist on a site in Maryland where this child had been taken years ago.  This mother Suzanne Cullen contacts Callie and Callie knows this woman is grasping at straws because she is not adopted.<br />Well, Callie who snoops around, she is a digger now, finds out she was adopted.  Her parents promise she was adopted in good faith.  Callie is determined to get to the bottom of this black market baby stealing for everybody's peace of mind.  Callie's ex husband is assigned to the same dig and he backs her all the way.  But there are people who do not want Callie digging around and will even kill to stop her.<br />This book was very creatively written, a true Nora Roberts romantic suspense thriller.  Where innocent people was tangled up in this drama and even killed along the way.  This was a book you could not put down for a minute.  You do not want to miss this one.  I really think it was one of her best!!	2003-06-05

Promoting understanding other peoples behavior and this may have very positive effect of reducing day-to-day conflict.<br /><br />Some of the book may come off as Phony, but I think it is how you read it.

I have to disagree with a reviewer, I found this book truly outstanding.  I really did, I think it is the best in the series thus far.  The entire book was very surprising, excellent scenario! <BR>Normally you figure it out toward the end the \\"who dune it\\" but this time round I didn't have a clue.<br />More of Roarke and Dallas's personal stories were revealed, but this time the shoe was on the other foot.  There is a secret Roarke discovered.  You learned a new side to him as he also learned this side.  You also saw a side to Eve as she put her work case second and her husband first.  I can't tell you what it is this would spoil it but to do all this learning the end up in Ireland.<br />Then a bright young college student is murdered and thrown in a recycler like so much trash, Lieutenant Eve Dallas is, determined to stand for the dead and find the killer. But perhaps most disturbing about this particular case, is that prior to the discovery of the body, a package of photos of the murdered girl were sent to Eve's friend, Nadine Furst, a well-known TV reporter. It's clear that the killer photographed the victim for some time before the death, without her knowledge, and it's also clear that in the picture, the girl is already dead. The killer wants Nadine's help in showing his work. Then the second victim in found and once again it revolves around their picture the killer had taken.  Portrait in Death blasted off with a bold and imaginative concept on an obsession of immortality, and light, but its depth grew when Robb emphasized on the action and characters. The storyline was so compelling, it really made this a page turning thriller. <br />All the characters who are loved were also back in this entry.  There is still humor between Eve and Peabody's dialog.  Still humor in Eve and Sumorset, even more in this story as he had a fall and delayed his holiday.  One talent Robb has is the building of characters. <br />This is a must read for all the In Death readers out there.  If you are new to the series, start at the beginning with Naked in death and just go down the line.  It will not take long either and they get addicting.  I know I can't wait for the new one to come out in fall.  I really do enjoy this series and I really do feel this was the best of them so far.	2003-05-20

One of the funniest books in the Stephanie Plum series.  A great Holiday edition with all the characters and laughter we expect. Stephanie is looking for Sandy Claws who jumped bail. It's four days before Christmas and she does not have a tree and her Christmas shopping has yet to begin. Then a sexy man named Diesel literally appears in her kitchen.

I absolutely loved the brothers trilogy, it was truly my favorite of all Nora Roberts trilogys.  Of course I do love them all!  This book was telling the story of Seth as he now is grown up. I felt like I knew the entire family and cared about each and every one of them. <br />Seth is home with his family, the business, and the mother who has followed him over the years since he was a young boy. Blackmailing him, doing her best to ruin everything for him and for the family that gave him everything and made him who he is. Although he's all grown up now, he'll still pay her off, do just about anything to protect the family he loves.  <br />Dru enters the picture,  who has fled a cheating fiance and the life of the wealthy in Washington D.C. to strike out on her own in St. Chris. She owns a flower shop and does her best to fit into the community. Given her experience with men, she doesn't want to fall in love, doesn't even want to date. But Seth can be as convincing as any of the Quinn men and Dru finds herself in love with Seth. <br />I think Nora Roberts did an excellent job with this ending story.  Her plot was great, the ending was a surprise and all the characters we loved in this trilogy have returned.  If you start with this book you may want to read the first three to start.	2003-05-13

It gives you everything the other seven books have. Hillarious scenes with the classic characters of wacky Grandma Mazur, Lula, and the rest of the Plum family plus unexpected new twists that break away from the romantic plot line. New involvement with Ranger and Joe, he is still in the running.<br />This installment is about the search for a missing woman named Evelyn and daughter Annie. Evelyn's grandmother Mabel is a neighbor of the Plum family and she asked Stephanie for her help. Evelyn's ex-husband is about to get a child custody bond funded by Mabel as she put her house up for this. Mabel fears she'll lose her home if Evelyn isn't found and she fears for her great-granddaughter.  So, Stephanie, our bounty hunter and her good friend Lula start snooping around and before long they have a run in with Evelyn's landlord, Eddie Abruzzi. Abruzzi, is a nasty man who adds a much needed dark edge to this story.<br />The humor you expect in a Stephanie Plum book is still there.  Stephanie is still between Joe and Ranger.  Stephanie still is blowing up cars and the drama from her friend Lula is still a riot.  I liked this book the least out of the series but it is still well worth the read and I still found myself laughing out loud several times.  If you enjoy this series and who couldn't, this is a must read!	2003-05-13

A truly wonderful thriller! <br />An innocent man is on trial for the rape and murder of a prostitute who was really an undercover cop. David Nash, a defense attorney, must put his career on the line to find the real murderer before the Innocent Man will become the Guilty Man.<br />This author truly has talent as I normally stay away from the courtroom drama.  Suspense would pop out at the simplest element.  My attention got me where I could not put the book down until I had read the entire thing.

You absolutely cannot wait until the next one is published.  Ms Robb has the talent to build characters, turns suspense from some simple element, just the right romance and humor all the way through.<br />In this installment of the In Death series, there is a computer virus going around New York and this is spreading from computer to man.

This is not the best novel by Ms. Roberts, and if you are a new reader of Roberts's books you do not want to start with \\" The Villa \\" or base her writing on this book.  The Villa still was a good book as a tale of Italian and Californian vineyards. A book about wine, wine making, wine selling and a family whose life is wine. There is more than one romance that blossoms in this novel and a mystery of sorts is thrown in.<br />Sophia and Tyler have known each other all their lives and have always remained friendly from a distance. Sophia travels and sells the wine made from the grapes that Tyler grows. Sophia's<BR>Grandmother reorganizes the company and the two are forced to work together which makes the sparks fly. The romance is exciting and full of heat and very believable.<BR>Sophia's mother is a very apprehensive woman who only wanted to be a wife and a mother. When her husband that she has been separated from for many many years decides he wants a divorce, it seems life is over. The reorganization brings a new man into her life and a second chance at love and motherhood. Murder, tainted bottles, burning buildings only adds to the excitement and mystique of this book.	2002-07-28

Rising Tides is the second book in the trilogy of the Quinn brothers. This second book of the trilogy was my favorite so far! I haven't read the third one yet but I will.  This book was very simple with a few twists and turns. I would highly reccomend this novel!  <br /> Ethan is the eldest brother and a fisherman, still living in the Maryland shore town where he was raised by Ray and Stella Quinn. He is a quiet, seemingly content man but you later learn that he has kept his emotions and such to himself for many years. Ethan shared Ray's loves of the sea, boating, and fishing. Ethan seems satisfied with his life until he comes to face his past demons when youngest brother, Seth joins the family and with a similar past.  Ethan is drawn to Seth having realized they both experienced horrific abuse at the hands of their natural parents during their early childhood. Because of this common thread, the story of their relationship is quite an emotional read. Ethan establishes a strong paternal relationship with his youngest brother and together, they are both able to put their past to rest. During the course of this book, Ethan realizes he is worthy of a loving relationship with Grace Monroe and her daughter Aubrey whom you will meet in Rising Tides and fall in love with. Ethan is the strongest of the Quinn brothers and through his love for his family and his job, he is able to give each of this brothers the emotional grounding they need to get through their family tragedy and learn to enjoy their lives once more. <br />I love Nora Roberts books! I like it when she writes something more than a romance or mystery. The real life topic in this book is child abuse and the devastating, life long effect it can have on families and people. Nora manages to get across this very disturbing subject and still write an enjoyable book with a wonderful romance!	2002-01-22

The game plan used in the book of finding the killer is unique. There's a really nasty man that you will love to hate.<br /> Eve and Roarke's relationship just keeps you on your toes. Eve is developing as a character with more depth, softness and humor.

Even with Eve's softening up she still has plenty of attitude and is always ready to kick some butt.<br /> A great read and a terrific addition to this very entertaining series.

I can't wait to read the next.  I am a true fan of Nora Roberts and love all her novels.  I think she is the most wonderful suspenseful romantic writer and I absolutely love her mystery series &quot;in death&quot;.  I normally don't read the silhouette, Harlequin genre and after reading this I am not sure why. <BR> Like a lot of Nora's books it is a series and should be read in order so that is what I intend to do.<br />Bailey is a mysterious women who has a gun, a diamond, a lot of money and amnesia.  She hires a Private investigator named Cade to find herself as she only has flashes of who she thinks she is.  <BR>The story is short and fast paced and a wonderful mystery and romance.  It is great for a quick read if you are one who can't put a book down until the end and don't have a lot of time.	2001-10-15

When Tory decides to return home to open a store she also decides she will put to rest her tragic past. A past the includes the murder of her best friend and the memories of a brutal father.<br /> There is a  romance that develops between Tory and Cade, her deceased best friend's brother.  A  friendship is also developed between Tory and Faith, her deceased best friend's twin sister. <br />I was falling in love with the town, feeling like the characters were my friends too, and all around impressed with Robert's technical skill in this novel. Nora Roberts knows how to deliver a great romantic and suspenseful novel. Carolina Moon is no exception!	2001-10-14

This fourth book in the series is one of nonstop falling off your chair laughter. Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter is after Maxine Nowicki, who is free on a stolen automobile charge. Her boyfriend, Eddie Kuntz, also offers Stephanie money in hopes that she can retrieve something extremely valuable to him...love letters, he claims. <br />The chase is on in this page-turning craze, and all of the extra added details that makes this adventure that much more funny! The cast of characters is helpful to Stephanie once again. Stephanie's family, especially Grandma Mazur, add pizzazz, depth, and a heck of a lot of humor to this great plot. <BR> Joe Morelli is also back and yes him and Stephanie finally get together! <BR> Lula, the large prostitute-turned-file clerk-slash-wannabe is hysterical in this book.  Her quick wit and street humor keep you rolling. <BR> This fourth book also introduces Sally Sweet, a code-breaking transvestite 'drag queen&quot; musician.  Grandma Mazur comes right out and asks Sally what a drag queen does with his ding-dong and I died laughing.  Stephanie's enemy, Joyce Barnhardt, also has a larger roll in this book, as the newest bounty hunter at the Vincent Plum bail bonds agency.<br /> This book is truly hysterical, pages keep turning with the fast paced humor and wit. This is the best book yet in the series and I thought three was good.  This series is highly recommended!	2001-10-09

Stephanie Plum, the lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter, after blackmailing her cousin Vinnie. As usual, Stephanie Plum's trials and tribulations had me laughing out loud! <br />In this third book Stephanie is after &quot;Uncle Mo,&quot; the local candy store/ice cream parlor owner, known by everybody in the neighborhood! Uncle Mo skips his court appearance for carrying a concealed weapon, and Stephanie, goes after him. Uncle Mo is nowhere to be found. The case soon winds up with attacks by strange anti-drug vigilantes, murdered men and porno films. The body count of the local drug dealers around his store continues to rise! Stephanie gets no help from the locals, only threats to leave uncle Mo alone.  Lula, the prostitute turned file clerk, has a much greater voice in this novel, and she truly adds laughter to the story with one trip out on her bounty hunting training. Police officer Joe Morelli is back and Stephanie is even concerned he has a girlfriend since he no longer seems interested.  Ranger is also back, with help and exercise! <BR> This novel you really get closer with all the characters.  The family dinner time just wouldn't be the same if one of Stephanie's friends wasn't invited to join them.<br /> The book flows at a blistering pace, and Evanovich's writing style is packed with humor. The suspense is outstanding and it is the best mix of comedy and mystery out there. It is hard not to enjoy this book!  I highly recommend this series you will laugh off your chair and out loud all the same!	2001-10-04

This addition to the &quot;in Death&quot; series, Loyalty in Death, has a group of terrorists named Cassandra planting bombs to kill alot of people. There are no demands being made at firstm, and there doesn't seem to be a motive for the bombings. Eve figures out , that the terrorist groups roots began many years before. The ending is very intense as both Eve's life, and Roarkes, are threatened as they close in on the main source behind this group.<br /> This was the best book yet in this excellent series! I don't know how Nora Roberts (a.k.a JD Robb) does it, but she keeps whipping out really great stories!  The &quot;in Death&quot; series has been very exciting to read each book, and getting to know the characters a little better with each book!	2001-09-30

Robb (aka Nora Roberts) puts out a new novel in the series every six months and they remain consistently well written.  It is a fantastic combination of sci fi, mystery and romance. They get better, and better, and started out great with the first book. Each section really builds the characters,  and this book I would say so far has the most emotion between Peabody and Eve.  Eve reveals a little bit of a side you knew was there but she doesn't show very often!<br />This section in the series, &quot;Witness in Death&quot; starts with Eve and Roarke attending opening night at the New Globe Theater (which Roarke does own) and witnessing a real murder right on the stage.  This one brings a bit of Eve's past back to her and she shows a sensitive side.  Another one of Eve's friends is a suspect and Eve goes out of her way to spare her.  You really get to know Peabody better and she carries her own and is such a fantastic character.<br />I love this series and it sure gets addicting.  I can't put a book down and J D. Robb does a great job with the &quot;Who done it &quot; I never know who it is until the very end.  If you haven't already, start with the first book in the series....Naked In Death!  I recommend this book and the entire series...You'll love them!	2001-09-30

I read this book for Midnight in Death by J. D. Robb. That story was just as intense and suspenseful in a third of the pages. Eve doesn't even get Christmas off. The other three stories in this book were more of a Romantic nature but just as good. I thought all four authors did a remarkable job in very few pages.

An irrational, bitter cop (Bowers) really hates Eve and messes up the case. This book goes further into Eve's past and you even see a soft side to her you hadn't seen before in the series.

Somerset, Roarke's butler has been jointly for many years coming to America together from Ireland.  Roarke feels he partly responsible for the death of Somerset's daughter even though Somerset doesn't feel this way. The murderer sends Eve riddles before each murder. And she persecutes over each riddle believing that if she can solve the riddle in time she might prevent the murder from happening. Somerset's  is really developed in this book as he is framed and made to look like the murderer. This was the best in this series yet.  This series offers a perfect blend of suspense, romance. It is fast paced and full of action.  I recommend this series to everybody.  You won't be disappointed but start with the first book!	2001-07-09

I thought the author did an excellent job on this book.  He didn't go into great depth but he covered exactly what needed to be covered.  The only thing I would disagree with was the start up fee I believe he had a thousand dollars for software....he must not use Flash and the Macromedia suite I think Director cost that alone and of course you always need Photoshop.  Other then that I liked his explanation of contracts.  He goes over getting jobs, book keeping.  Like he states if you have an attorney and an accountant you are good to go!  He even talks about make effective web sites.  No, he doesn't go into great detail but the reading is easy and effective he gets straight to the point and this allows you to add your on creativity in ideas to stretch his.  If you have problems with that then you are probably in the wrong business.  I highly recommend this book!	2001-07-09

I have never read a book that has touched my heart like this did.  I read this extraordinary story from this courageous mother three times now.<br />I myself have been recently diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.  I am not a child but in fact I am in my thirties with three children of my own.  My level of manic depressant isn't near to the same as Nick's was.  I seem to run more manic then the suicidal.  However, what goes up must come down.  I have had great success with Lithium and live a happy normal life. While reading this story I can relate.  As even though everybody with this disease is not going to be on the same level there are in fact similarities.  One's which indeed start with us as a child.  I know I took a very good look at my own childhood through this story and the signs were always there but as Ms. Steele went through how hard it is to know these are in fact signs.<br />This book has you go through every emotion there is.  I laughed, at her remarks about the doctors as it is indeed very true.  There are so many out there, some good, some better, some stupid and some who just don't care.  I even laughed when Nick left the camp and when he telephoned his mother and she asked where he was at and he was on the highway.  That was me, if I told you they were not giving me my medication it was because they were not, and I couldn't understand anything else even though you may of though it to be \\" a story\\" or \\" delusional \\" and if I said I was leaving the next call you got from me would have also been on the highway.  At least I called!  Then you also cry, even with this event.  You can feel this mother, in her hotel room thousands and thousands of miles away, with all the other children, you feel her frustration, despair and the entire emotional experience.<br />This book was very well written. Coming from an author of fiction, she did not sugar coat or glorify anything in this book.  I can't even begin to imagine the strength it had taken to be able to writeit.  The emotion that was relived with each and every word.  Maybe it might have been a relief to tell the story, but we are very fortunate that she did!<br />This disease is all around, and even in this book of a famous celebrity even she had lived it for years.  Knowing there was something wrong with her child but was the only one being his mother who did see it.  Children do get misdiagnosed with the ADD all the time.  Sometimes it may be a combination, and sometimes not at all.  But even Ms. Steele explains with all her connections, all her money and resources how she couldn't even get a prescription for Prozac because nobody else could see it.  Think of how many children out there that goes without this everyday.  Not because their mother isn't Danielle Steele and doesn't have these kinds of resources.  But how many children, that live maybe in your house, or next door, or in your sisters or brothers because they are misunderstood.<br />I highly recommend this book to absolutely everybody.  This as anybody with Bipolar does it help you understand what you have put your own family through.  Even though you would take it all back in a minute if you could, you see and feel it from the other side. <br /> Then as a family with anybody in it the inspiration of this wonderful family that lived it everyday.  And also to those who know nobody with it because sometimes people, especially children do get so misunderstood as Nick did.  He comes from a celebrity mother, he is spoiled, all these excuses for these actions that nobody sees what it really is.  How many years did Ms. Steele go through not knowing what was wrong with her son?  Some don't even have ones whom are as persistent as Ms. Steele and family just because they are pure exhausted and still getting no results.  Not because they do not care.<br />This book tells the story, it has pictures and even in Nicky's photos do you see his wonderful personality and bright light.  She has included writings from her to him, journal entries that Nick had written and I think the one the effected me the most, I had to actually put the book down the tears were pouring out I could not see to read anymore.  Was what Julie had said about Ms. Steel and Nick and their \\" tag team mothering \\"<br />I want to thank you Ms. Steele for sharing this story.  I know it made great impact on my life and helped me to want nothing more than to stop hurting the ones I love.  To beat the demons for myself but for my own children.  And watch and be aware of these symptoms and how they do effect each others life.   People of great creativity suffer with this disease everyday.  They live normal lives to those that look in, but deep within them they are not as they appear.  They have this great extraordinary personality and nobody seems to have a clue.  You told the story from the heart and it touched mine.<br />God bless you Ms. Steele, your family, the Campbell's and to all the lives that Nicky touched.  God bless you Nick Traina and I hope you finally find the peace and happiness you  do so deserve and may your memories live on with the people whom loved you!	2001-06-05

Nora Roberts writes these under the name of JD ROBB. I did just start this series as I read everything I can get my hands on from Nora. If you are a new reader, you do need to start with this book and work your way through. I didn't start here first and she really builds the characters through each story that if you don't start from the beginning you miss a lot. I went back and am now starting from the beginning. This series is not Nora's romance format. Of course there is romance in there! This series is a mystery style. It takes place in NYC in the year 2058. When people do travel &quot; off planet&quot; and prostitution is legal. Your car drives you and you have &quot; auto chefs &quot; in house, car , even your office. The way ROBB writes about the future this is truly believable. Lt. Eve Dallas is a tough woman. She is strong, independent, and she truly fights and believes in her job as homicide detective. In this book she finds her main suspect a billionaire name Roarke. He is very charming, Irish, has lived a little on the edge, rich, and good-looking! Eve has now found her match. Roarke didn't have the ideal childhood either and they make the most wonderful couple. This is an excellent series, and keeps you entertained and you don't want to put the book down. Robb does a great job in making the who done it a total surprise! I highly recommend this entire series you will truly be delighted  It is awesome!!!	2001-05-15

Eve and Ruarke continue in the developing a relationship, unlikely for both being they are very strong and independent characters. You get a little bit of both their haunting pasts as you go along.  This does keep it very interesting.  The year is 2058 and the setting for this future is really easy to believe and she did a great job with the setting.

This book is the account of Frank McCourt and the reminiscences of his childhood spent in Ireland. The story is told from the perspective of young Francis Mccourt, from the young age of 5 until he hits the age of 19, and we see him mature before our own eyes as the writing manner changes from chapter to chapter. This is a story of how Francis McCourt lived and survived through the desolation of his childhood, with a drunken father. The start of the book is very depressing, with the death of Frank's baby sister, following deaths of his twin brothers, many parts of the books still have funny descriptions. I found myself laughing along the way reading this book and defiantly putting a smile on my face. It is truly amazing the kid has not gone into depression in such an inconsiderate atmosphere. He even had dreams of going to America and earning big bucks, which many had tried to convince him to forget. Frank is one determined person to succeed. This is a book not to miss, the insight of Frank is truly amazing and you see life through a totally different light!	2001-04-26

I was glad to find that the story was far more engaging than most of her recent efforts, and in some ways tries to recall her writing of past. It most closely resembles her past writing in manner and theme, the successful Hollywood family ... perfect from the outside but has many blemishes within the circle.   This isn't as good as Ms. Steele once wrote but is better then her most recent.  I was a dedicated Danielle Steel reader and really had been very disappointed in her writing that I quit buying her all together and I love Nora Roberts.  Steele over uses plain words and makes her characters named after a real person...is this accident?  She has become more than predictable and almost at the point of ` trash \\". She did decent job writing about all the hassles of having a modern-day wedding. She's back on the right track, but still needs to work on her laziness storytelling.  She isn't the author she once was, this book is much better then several of her latest but far, far, to what I would call great.

You don't know what page which object is on so you must remember these objects (or look back in the first couple pictures until you get it narrowed down) this adventure takes you to find which path, find the missing skaters, which skier in which chair. My favorite was the toboggan race and finding the route (a fun maze!)  Each set of double pictures also has a puzzle, full of mazes, searches, matching, and spotting.

Their four-year-old daughter, Livvy, was in the house the night Julie was murdered. She tried to find her mother and finds her father bending over her mother's bloody body. She hides in a closet where a very nice policeman, Frank Brady, later found her. Although her mother's twin sister, Jamie, and her husband, David, wanted to have Olivia live with them, she went to live with her grandparents who run River's End, a lodge and campground on Washington state's Olympic Peninsula far from the media circus. Livvy lives in the safe environment her grandparents provided for her. Loving nature, Livvy goes to college majoring in resource science and returns to River's End to open a naturalist center that she dreamed about. Twenty years after Julie's murder, Sam Tanner's parole has continued to be denied thanks in large part to the testimony of Frank Brady and Julie's twin sister, Jamie. Stricken with a terminal cancer, Sam contacts best-selling true-crime author Noah Brady (Frank's son) to finally tell his side of the story. Noah has long been interested in the case; and, particularly in Livvy, who he has had contact with a couple of times in the past 20 years. Noah knows he will have to get all sides of the story, not just Sam's which will mean seeing Livvy again. When Noah sees Livvy, the attraction is still there but little does he know that in his quest to get her father's story, her life will be in danger for there is one person who knows the truth of what happened that night 20 years before.  RIVER'S END is one of Nora Roberts best.... way to go Nora!!!	2001-04-12

My children are 10, 8, and 5 and I notice the difference in what each one asks from these pictures.  I think this series is wonderful because it does combine the puzzle concept with so much else.

This book is wonderful!  My daughter received it at age 2 from my favorite Aunt who always did give the best books!  This has allowed our family library to grow and become what it is.  My daughter was, as so many children are, fascinated with the moon.  Every night she would get so excited &quot; boom boom &quot; she would say and point.  We were much to tall until I got down on the floor at her level did I realize what it was she pointed to.  Then the comprehension that it is the same moon takes about another few months as my daughter had to call her grandfather each night with excitement to what &quot; her Moon &quot; was doing and he should come over and see this.  Eric Carle does the most extraordinary job through all his books letting the child see through the wonderful pictures and learning these simple concepts, that children must learn.  This is an excellent book for any child and one of my very favorites as that two year old has turned ten, and her younger sister and brother also have gotten a wonder message and many hours from this book!

This has been my son's favorite book since he knew what a book was and he is now age five.  I even had to get the board book so he could take it everywhere, as I know I have sat down on the kitchen floor, outside on the driveway, in the middle of the supermarket because it was time to read the spider book.  My son has two older sisters' who also did enjoy this book but I see the difference between girls and boys.  A book my son never could sit still and listen he had to get up and mock each animal and sound.  This is not just for the youngest child as my daughters learned to read and it is a great early reading book.  My son has this memorized and does read it to all his friends and preschool class.

We spend this great quality time together as a family group.  Now that I write this review from far away at a conference with grown adults, overly stressed.

I am someone who is highly interested in all things computer I have throughout my computer learning taken note of several different learning kinds. There are those whom want to jump right in and do their thing...without really understanding the why behind the thing they are doing. Then there is the learner that never seems to grasp anything theoretically and is so absorbed on following precise measures from books that when something finally does goes wrong they are just lost without the guidelines. Then there are the more middle learners, that do not take all forms of instruction factualy but also seek to do cool things and can absorb and put together all instuction quite well. <br />This book offers a rarity in computer books today: in-depth, precise, clear explanations of what you are supposed to do to do some cool things when you get your inspiration, and great behind the scenes insight to help you understand why you need to do what to do, to do your cool things. Flash is all the rage today most people are reading books searching for methods that come from graphic designers when these people reading these books clearly are not graphic designers. If you want to learn  and figure out how to solve problems through design then buy some graphic design theory books, but don't buy Flash 5 books simply because they offer neat tricks when you don't even understand the individual concepts that combine to make those neat little tricks. To really get far in that end of Flash you will unfortunately have to undertake learning programming theory because all of those tricks make use of programming and that is a separate system ogre of its own. <br />This is certainly the book you want to buy if  you are a designer who knows how to do the pretty stuff but you want to put together this into Flash and want to have a complete know how of the program that will allow you to carry out your ideas. This was by far an excellent Flash book and something you don't want to miss!	2001-03-06
