You can't helped but become wrapped up in the love triangle and the unfolding secrets that keep spreading before you as you learn more about Michael and the other occupants of his mansion.

I was particularly impressed with the story at first, but it did make me curious and hinted at spoilers to come. It is worth reading this and the other two volumes currently released because the story gets even better and the art becomes adicting with it's airy and open lyricism. If you enjoy romance or gothic manga, I recommend this Korean manhwa to you. You won't regret buying it.	2004-10-02

Who can help but love Count D and his charming occupation of \\"selling love and dreams\\" to people who usually don't realize what they are getting into when they buy his rare and rather deadly creatures for pets. There are currently eight volumes released already of this title, and the story becomes more fluent and interesting. The relationship between D and Detective Orcot is amusing and wonderful as they experience more and Orcot sorta becomes a believer. More like is forced to. You will enjoy this delightful tale of horror and dreams intermingled together in such a way that will make you ravenous for more...	2004-10-02

There are so many manhwa's that have been translated now it's great that we get to experience a new taste in manga art! I've now read so many manga's and manhwa's it is absolutely sick and probably the reason that I have now become one. Snow Drop is one of my current favourite series. The first explanation I read about this series said it was a Romeo and Juliet type story. It isn't really, which makes me glad. The two main character, Hae-gi and So-na are youths with problems, troubled pasts that they have not come to terms with and set them appart from other kids. The two high-schoolers find kindred spirits in each other and fall deeply in love, but they have many obsticles to over come. For one, So-na the rich daughter of a politician and Hae-gi is a poor nobody. Other people also try to split them appart, but they cling together and it seems that perhaps something surprising in their pasts also link them together... <br />My fav character's in this story are actually the side character, Jang Ha-da and Oh Ko-mo; So-na's childhood friend and Hae-gi's crossdressing brother respectively.  <br />Fun and sweet, you will like Snow Drop's lyrical story and hip art.	2004-10-01

If you have ever wanted to read a novel where unicorns lived and talked and had there own society and way of life, this is it! Interesting story of how a young and fool-hardy unicorn goes through his pilgrimage to become a warrior and a saviour to his people. Filled with action and mysterious villains, the horrible wyverns, it is a fantastical tale told in flowing old-style language at sometimes, that will captivate and delight all fantasy and sci-fi readers.

I didn't really think of it as a horror novel, though, and it wasn't suspensful, just frustrating. The incest in the book makes it more interesting and you can definately see it coming.

It is violent and macabre. The stories would probably be traumatizing to a little kid. I thought they were strangely enchanting, though. (Not in a pretty fariy tale way!) This manga contains two stories; Mermaids's Gaze and Mermaid's Mask. Mermaid's Gaze was my favourite of the two. It had more plot and more purpose in action. The second, Mermaid's Mask, was good too. It was just a little more gruesome and weird, with a woman who has eatenthe flesh of a mermaid and gains a painful scar from its poison, forcing her to cut of her face and switch for others. That's kinda icky, ya know? The first story has to deal with an homicidal manic who ate the mermaid's flesh and has become immortal. But there is something he wants more than immortality; a mysteriously life-like doll! And he'll kill to get it.  Both stories are, of course, staring our two favourite immortal lovers: Mana and Yuta, who risk themselves in their travels to help those affected by the poison of the mermaid's flesh. Very good artwork by Takahashi-sama and thrilling, hard-to-put down plots! Great for any manga lover or anyone willing to read something new!	2001-06-18

Unfortunately, the whole of the manga series isn't available in english yet, but read what you can of it! I think they have six of them translated so far! This first volume gives you greater insight as to why Miaka is trying so hard to study and get into Jonan. Also, the way she and Yui are seperated is told better and makes more sense in the manga. It has tons of new funny stuff in here, so enjoy! A must for FY fans everywhere, as well as a good intro to FY for newbies.	2001-06-18

I was pulled into Gelsey's heart and felt her pain. She is probably the most beautiful and amazing dancer that ever was in America. Yet she did not feel beautiful. I could relate to all of Gelsey's struggles and emotional hardships. I recommend this book to all those who enjoy autobiographies, all who enjoy ballet, and especially to those who wish to become dancers. It gives a truly realistic view into the dance world. Will become a favourite. Other books to read; Holding Onto the Air by Suzanne Farrell, The Shape of Love (which is the continuing book to Dancing on My Grave) by Gelsey Kirkland and Greg Lawrence.	2000-11-16

I bought it because I am an artist and liked the cover. The book turns out to be just as good. The main character is a headstrong young woman who wants to be a mans equal in all things, even in warriorism. She doesn't want to marry the man she is betrothed to , but if she doesn't it will stop the fulfilment of the prophesy of the firstborn. Entertaining and enjoyable for avid fantasy readers, or first time fantasy readers.	2000-11-16

I think that she would have been happiest knowing that others remembered her by continuing her work. Not by giving money to charity, although that is kind, but by loving others in need of love and helping those who are lonely. Diana cannot write her own biography now, but this book is, as it says, the closest thing we will get to her own autobiography. In the book it tells the story of how Diana grew up, became a troubled princess, and a happy mother. It speaks of her eating dissorder and how she over came it and changed her life by finding meaning in service. It also has been added onto in the end to tell about the last years of her life, her divorce, her death. It contains a special section that show Diana's words for the original story and contains pictures. Altogether it is and amazing book and most likely all true.	2000-11-16

This book which he wrote with Francis Mason, is very handy for balletomane's to have on their shelves. It explains about different ballet's, both classical and contemporary, and describes their story line or plot and gives detailed comments about how the ballet is presented. Good for reference or for curious readers.	2000-11-16

It is the last book the the Cheysuli Chronicles, and finishes a saga that covers one-hundred years of fantastical history and brings about the end of a magical prophecy. It is my favourite book in this series next to Daughter of the Lion. If you like Marion Zimmer Bradley, Andre Norton or Anne Mcaffery, you will enjoy reading this!	2000-11-16
