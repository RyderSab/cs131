Williams looks at her father with a clear-eyed compassion. She first learned of her parentage when she was a teenager; she had no choice but to make allowances for the segregated society in which her father was a political mover and shaker.<br /><br />As you turn the pages of this book, you will feel along with Williams anger, fear, pain, but also you will rejoice in her successful struggle to make a meaningful life for herself, to find joy in family and career, to maintain loving respect for her father.  He privately acknowledged her, helped her with higher education, gave generous gifts of money, and remained in touch with her throughout his long life.<br /><br />Williams's story can be viewed as a tragedy of the American south with its unenlightened prejudices and hypocrisies; but it also can be viewed as a story of family ties, of love and honor shown by a father and daughter who were forced to make their separate, emotionally costly accommodations to the culture into which they were born.	2005-05-12

A few years previous to the disappearance of Peterson's wife Laci,  Bird had been reunited with her birth mother, Jackie Peterson, and had found another warm and welcoming family.<br /><br />  \\"Blood Brother\\" describes Bird's slowly growing suspicions that Peterson may indeed be guilty.  Her book gives us many previously unknown details of Scott's whereabouts, actions, and behavior before he was arrested.  She describes her increasingly conflicted feelings about the man their mother referred to as \\"my golden boy.\\"  Although she realizes that she risks alienating the warm relationship she had established with her birth mother, she becomes convinced of Scott's guilt.<br /><br />  \\"Blood Brother\\" is an absorbing look into a California family's lifestyle of ease and comfort, unravelled by violent death and sensational publicity.  Although Regan Books doubtless rushed it into print, the book is well-crafted, articulate, and well worth reading.  Recommended.	2005-05-12

I figure, 700+ per year, so I do one year per day. My spirits are lifted immeasurably as I feast on this marvelous commentary on the human experience.  Some cartoons are laugh-out-loud, some are slapstick style, some are poignantly heart-touching.<br /><br />  I find that the cartoons from the first years, 1925 to early 1928, are rather snooty and mean-spirited in tone; but, beginning in later 1928, the cartoons begin to assume the recognizably insouciant form that contemporary readers relish. A very few of the references are \\"time-sensitive\\", relating to topics that are now forgotten;  but most of the cartoons are as fresh and funny today as 75 years ago.<br /><br />  A technical note: Some earlier reviewers have complained that the cd cartoons are \\"too small\\".  If you use Adobe \\"zoom\\" you can magnify any of them to make them much larger so that the smaller, panel cartoons become readable.<br /><br />  This \\"take to a desert island\\"  book is an absolute must-have for New Yorker readers.  I also recommend \\"Complete Book of Covers from The New Yorker: 1925-1989\\", a feast of artwork, which has graced our coffee table for many years.	2005-04-24

Cain serves up the REAL Nancy Drew, as appealing in her own way as she was in the pages of Carolyn Keene \\"who got a lot of things wrong.\\"<br /><br />  All the familiar characters are here---Ned Nickerson (whom Nancy does marry); Bess (not really plump at all--indeed, slightly anorexic due to her anxiety over the way she is depicted by Keene); George (with a \\"life partner\\"); Hannah Gruen (with a surprising secret); Carson Drew (with a svelte young wife).  Many other figures from the pages of childhood mystery series appear--foremost among them, Nancy's love, Frank Hardy.<br /><br />  Readers will find themselves chuckling over every page and experiencing delightful nostalgia mixed with wry, clear-eyed adult humor.

The reader will be transported to the brutal life of the Old South as seen from the slaves' perspective, a life of tending cane and tobacco, of working from dawn to dusk, of being subjected to the whims and lusts of \\"Mas\\".<br /><br />  Written in dialect, with the present-tense verbs often lacking the ending \\"s\\", the rich texture of this novel is authentic and evocative.

John Mariani's comprehensive work includes many recipes, from the simplest to those involving many steps and considerable cooking experience and skill, from Colonial foods to present day dishes.  I found this book fascinating, sat down and read it cover to cover, and rose up eager to try some of the recipes.<br /><br />  There were dozens of varieties of fish listed, including many I have never cooked or eaten. There were colorful colloquialisms, some of which would be familiar to modern readers, others from long-ago times.<br /><br />  A great general interest book, Mariani's work especially appeals to \\"foodies\\" ( one of the contemporary terms he defines).  Readers will gain an appreciation for the bounty of the 21st century American table as well as an understanding of how our foremothers creatively improvised with basic ingredients like cornmeal and molasses.<br /><br />  This book is highly recommended as a page-turning overview of the surprising sophistication and palate-pleasing delights of American cuisine!	2005-02-28

Since then, this book has attained a kind of cult status among readers of British mysteries, especially those with an interest in history.  I heard the book favorably mentioned for years, finally found time to read it, and realized the hype is not overdone.<br /><br />  The narrative tone is a little---but noticeably--different in tone from current books of the genre; it is perhaps slightly more formal, more cerebral. The reader is soon aware of the author's carefully chosen words and wit, and senses that here is a rewarding leisure-time read.<br /><br />  I won't reveal the plot of the book or spoil any of the mystery except to say that Richard III is presented here in a new, entirely plausible view.  Facts, inductive intuition, and a good understanding of human character and motives,unite to aid the detective, who is stuck in bed recovering from an injury, to reach his conclusions.<br /><br />  A great read to savor and enjoy---highly recommended!	2004-12-20

Can you still picture the charts for \\"how a bill becomes a law\\"? Jon Stewart and the writers of the Daily Show have produced a book in that familiar format, but with \\"Mad\\" magazine content that will have you belly-laughing from the first page to the last.<br /><br />  For all you viewers who are hooked on the \\"Daily Show\\", you'll find that this book is even more fun.  Unlike Al Franken's \\"Lies and the Lying Liars...\\", in which the humor is often so subtle that its targets may not even perceive they are been made lampooned, the satire of Stewart's book is flat-out and broadly rendered.  Democrats, Republicans, the Green Party, the Bull Moose party---all are equally skewered. The same is true for  Founding Fathers to current pols. Our perhaps most venerable institution, the Supreme Court, is not above Stewart and company's low blows.<br /><br />  There are some extra touches, like the very modest, hesitant and apologetic offerings from a Canadian girl, interspersed throughout.

An only child, she details her mother's unhappy journey as an orphan who made a late and unfulfilling marriage and who became a \\"stage mother,\\" lavishing her daughter with love.<br /><br />  Joyce Johnson broke away from the homelife that stifled her, and gave her heart, several times, to abstract artists: This book is about blankness and absence. Although she writes without excessive self-pity, nevertheless bleakness, sorrow, and longing permeate its pages.  There is little here about her successful career, her life in publishing, which might mitigate the wistful tone of her memoir.	2004-12-20

I read these as a little break from Christmas baking, decorating, and party planning, and found the stories to be lively and diverting, with just the right mixture of trendy references and plot twists.<br /><br />  George also writes an intro to each tale, describing how she got the idea, which is an insight into her creative processes.  The title story, set near Bosworth Field, came to her in the whole cloth, as a total picture. She recited it into a small recorder as best she could, battling wind and cold as she and a friend stood near St. James Church, where King Richard prayed the night before his decisive battle.<br /><br />  Five stars to her for this little anthology in a difficult genre!	2004-12-05

Her well crafted sentences reveal the careful thinking she has done as she ponders how her generation, born into sunny safety after the horrors their parents had known, has viewed those events that cast a shadow over their parents' lives.<br /><br />  Hoffman is highly intelligent, well educated, with broadbased understanding of the atrocities, the loss and the uprooting, the courage to begin anew, of those who emerged from the camps. She perceives the ambiguous borders between victimhood and dangerous resistance, the fateful choices her parents faced on a daily  basis.<br /><br />  Her book is a highly valuable contribution to a world where conditions of genocide still exist.	2004-12-05

This newest blockbuster book is the tale of merciless murderer Gary Ridgway, the Green River serial killer.<br /><br />  For twenty years, Rule kept notes, e-mails, newspaper accounts, letters from tipsters of all kinds.  Throughout this lengthy period when the crimes went unsolved, she stayed in touch with the policemen working on the case as well as with many of the victims' families.  Her interviews with them, and her deep compassion for their unanswered questions and their unresolved sorrow, flavors this book from start to finish.  These young women, most in their teens and twenties, come back to life in Rule's pages.  The reader will be chilled to see how in many cases, adolescent rebellion alienated them from loving families and set them on a deadly path, from street life to an early grave.  Most of the victims are pictured on the inside covers of Rule's book, as well as in the pages detailing their stories; the pictures will draw the reader even further into Rule's description of their tragically shortened lives.<br /><br />  Through the 1980s and well into the 1990s, corpses kept turning up in the very vicinity of Rule's own home, hidden in the woods bordering roads she often drove upon. Along with the many policemen involved in the cases, she felt frustrated as the years passed and the killer remained on the loose.  At last, forensic science made major breakthroughs, with the use of DNA to capture  criminals.  It was Gary Ridgway's DNA that identified and eventually convicted him, although some of his victims may yet remain undiscovered.<br /><br />  Ann Rule remains indisputably at the top of her form and the top of her field as the premier true-crime writer in the country.<br />She is dedicated to presenting the victims' stories, which she tells with her trademark compassion.  Five stars!	2004-12-03

She's done her research, and in these pages many people speak about what makes them spring from their beds in the morning.<br /><br />  Her interviews with scientists in various fields, from astronomers to physicists to zoologists, are especially enlightening and give the reader a notion of how many scientists view their work as a kind of play.  My husband, a cloud physicist, could strongly identify with descriptions of the joy that fuels their long hours in the observatory, lab, or field.<br /><br />  Jamison earnestly discusses exuberance, confidence, optimism, and energy, and relates how, from the earliest age, it's fairly easy for an observer to identify the temperament of a child.  She correlates exuberance with the extroverted temperaments.  (Introverted, sensitive types reading this book are liable to become saddened as they realize it's harder for them to join the party!)<br /><br />  Jamison, taken in by the high-spirited ones among us, fails to recognize the \\"downside\\".  For example, in some cases, there is a predilection for short-lived and ultimately, unproductive interests; in others, impatience, zealousness, and a kind of imperialism that runs roughshod over other people.<br /><br />  Each temperament has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  While living \\"exuberantly\\" may be a wonderful goal, those who are naturally energetic, strong, and confident, have flaws like those  described above. Ask my husband or children!<br /><br />  In a previous work, Jamison has described the awe she felt when she looked at computer-generated pictures of her own brain, lighting up and darkening in affected areas.  Revealing the circuitry of the brain has aided the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  It is within the range of possibility that someday, a person's temperament will be revealed in the same manner, and the<br />heritability of temperament will be scientifically established.<br />(Mothers through the ages have been aware that their children's natures differed, even in the womb.

As a disclaimer, I don't watch Oprah or SATC but I see from previous reviews that Oprah gave the book a big  sales push.<br /><br />  First off, girls, we have intuition and the overwhelming majority of us KNOW when someone is interested and when he is not. Regardless if he's brash or shy, bombastic or sweetly soft-spoken, pushy or retiring, we know.  Men cannot be lumped together into one \\"he\\" just as women cannot be one \\"she\\".<br /><br />  Secondly, we women are \\"hard-wired\\" for connectedness; thank God for that, or the human race would not continue.  If you're one of those who beats herself up for getting emotional, and for dreaming of nesting with a  man and nurturing children, stop it right now! There is no guilt involved, there is no shame. Remember even Gloria Steinem, famous for her statement, \\"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle,\\" eventually did marry.<br /><br />  The third point is a caution:  Many women are attracted by the players, those bad boys, who seem to promise so much fun, adventure, and romance, but who often are too immature to deliver<br />what we women are seeking.  The book's author, Greg, seems to know a lot of those guys!  Yes, ladies, chemistry is vitally important, but there are many good guys who will make your heart zing, so don't bother with the bad ones.  That's the core message of this book:  Don't bother with the bad ones.  Don't \\"waste the pretty\\" by agonizing over player-behavior.<br /><br />  Fourth point, cannot be emphasized too strongly:  Some male reviewers have already written well about this.  Men like women.  Take care of yourself, use perfume, smile and be friendly to everyone whenever and wherever.  Life is full of surprises. You may \\"meet cute\\" as in the movies, so be ready!<br /><br />  Fifth, a wise old folk saying: \\"He chased her until she caught him.\\"  Let your radar guide you, girls, as men are individuals and cannot be treated all the same.  Generally, however: do not be overly needy, do not stalk or bombard with phone calls or gifts, but do be warm and responsive and always interested in what interests your guy.  Let it develop naturally between you, let trust grow along with love.  You don't need to become cynical, and you don't need a formula, and you don't really even need to read yet another book!  Respect yourself, don't warp yourself into knots trying to follow some rules or be someone you are not.  Remember, men LIKE women.  Just keep showing up!he same.

Brooks has perfect pitch for the way they talk, the way they decorate their living and working environments, their vehicles,  amusements and pre-occupations---in short, the life-style of the highly educated, newly rich, \\"bobos\\"---bourgeois bohemians.<br /><br />  Their \\"merit elite,\\" mixing an unlikely blend of corporate capitalism with free-spirited hippiehood, produces wide-ranging cognitive dissonance. Brooks' perceptive eye duly records all, and presents it to the reader with a heavy dose of calculated wit.

Beginning in the era of Ronald Reagan, some voters left the Democratic party bloc vote to swing to the right.  These \\"Reagan Democrats\\" did so, it was commonly assumed, over social issues;the right-to-life movement, gun control legislation, and so on.<br /><br />  Frank writes of the territory he knows best, the state where he grew up, \\"heartland\\" Kansas.  His title is a quote from an essay written by an early twentieth-century Kansas journalist, much esteemed in his time, William Allen White.<br /><br />  I had been scratching my own head in wonderment over the irony that Frank describes again and again:  Why are these people--farmers, union workers, and lower middle-class working people, some of them with truly hardscrabble lives-- voting against their own interest and aligning themselves with corporations, big money, oil and banking and pharmaceutical conglomerates?  When and how did this hoodwinking of the electorate begin and how does it continue?<br /><br />  Frank's analysis will surprise and enrage those on the left.<br /><br />Our two-party system is to be lauded and preserved; the best way is to open up an honest dialogue, to educate people about the agendas of each party--especially the economic agendas. The Republicans have fanned the flames of social issues which cannot be quickly and satisfyingly resolved at the ballot box but are to be decided by the courts over many years.The Democrats, striving to be the party of \\"inclusiveness\\", have taken in zealots whose stands on social issues are distasteful to voters. The Democrats also have taken in upwardly-mobile, educated baby boomers, who are perceived by the old-time Democratic blocs to have a patronizing attitude of \\"We know what is best for you,\\" rather than, \\"We are in this together.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line persists: It's the party of the people v. the party of wealth and privilege.  It's time to get back to basics, time to clear away the Republican social-issue smoke screens and to unite the Democratic party on its original solidly strong base.

Those  with the greatest need to read it will probably never open it, yet some may condemn all favorable reviews!<br /><br />  Franken has put together an energetic, highly motivated, extremely bright group of researchers (whom he lists and describes at the end of the book) to back up his assertions and to expose the shoddy, shallow name-callers of the right, people of the ilk of Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter.<br /><br />Franken refers to his approach as \\"kidding on the square\\", making his points and telling the truth with great hilarity and a wit which the people mentioned above, can only rail against but can never equal.  What an accomplishment---a laugh-out-loud on every page, some sly digs administered with such subtle humor that some of it doubtless goes right over the heads of many of his targets, and  some absolutely-verifiable facts along with irrefutably-accurate charts.  Even the charts bubble over with Franken's  pointed wit.  My favorite is the one showing the number of military horses purchased by Abraham Lincoln with those purchased by Ronald Reagan.  (His point?  Different time, different situation: Unfair to compare Reagan's military \\"cold war\\" expenditures with those of Bill Clinton's after the Soviet Union was disbanded.)<br /><br />Franken's book is written in a friendly, often modest, \\"Minnesota-nice\\" tone which will stingingly enrage his right-wing critics even more.

Those of us who grew up strong and healthy on Chef Boyardee canned spaghetti and lime jello with marshmallows, will find this trip down tastebud-memory lane, a delight. (That does not mean that much of the food of those days was so delightful!)<br /><br /> The baby boom generation mothers were encouraged to leave kitchen drudgery behind, to put together meals by using can openers and taking tv dinners from the freezer. Surprisingly, many women rejected this approach, some more than others. The food industry learned some lessons about merchandising; one of the most famous is that women felt better about the cakes they made from boxes if they were called upon to add a fresh egg of their own to the powdered mix.<br /><br /> When I was a young wife and mother, I and many of my friends staged our own little revolution against &quot;convenience cuisine&quot;. The bread we kneaded and baked, the yogurt cultures we nourished, the from-scratch decorated cookies we made at holidays, the fresh vegetables we scrubbed and served...all these foods tasted GOOD, in stark contrast to the boxed and frozen food of our own childhoods.<br /><br /> No one would want to return to the age of the wood stove and all-day cooking chores, when cake making required attacking the eggs laboriously with a hand beater. Shapiro's book is about that transition stage, through the late 40s, and on into the 50s and 60s, when taste and even nutrition were often sacrificed for ease of preparation. Today, with bread machines, Cuisinarts, and a Trader Joe's Market down the street with its sophisticated world cuisine, we are blessed with meals that are easy to make and gloriously delicious to eat.	2004-08-03

Lebstock gives us highly detailed, vivid descriptions of that time and place, and the cast of characters, both black and white folks, come to life under her expert pen.<br /><br /> This non-fiction book reads like a fictional murder mystery, and it's a marvelous treat for readers like me who find real life vastly more interesting than imaginary plots.<br /><br /> Who really killed Lucy Pollard in her farm yard that fateful day more than a hundred years ago? Lebsock presents the facts, and the reader is left to draw his/her own conclusions. Highly recommended.	2004-08-03

He has more than crime on his mind, as he debates with himself whether or not he has room in his life for his love interest, Emma Lavenham.<br /><br />  In his usual blend of acutely senstive psychological insight coupled with the details of routine police investigation, Dalgliesh unravels the mysteries and P.D.

Many of the leading medical scientists of the time who fought the plague, are depicted. The politics of the time, heavily influenced by wartime decisions, are highlighted. The author is not bashful about asserting his own sometimes surprising opinions as to how the strategies of war adversely affected the fight against influenza.<br /><br /> This thought-provoking book is highly recommended, not the least as a cautionary tale. We have won the fight against bacterial illness, but viral illness remains an elusive target. Our world has shrunk and a deadly virus can spread within hours throughout civilization. One does not have to be an alarmist to see the implications.	2004-08-03

It's a romance, a mystery, a period piece set in the Adirondack Mountains at the turn of the 20th century. Open-hearted 16-year-old Mattie Gokey is an imaginative, perceptive girl, with a budding talent for writing, who notices things which often escape those around her. When she discovers a bundle of letters, the plot is set in motion, as she strongly identifies with the young woman who wrote the letters and finds parallels in her own life.<br /><br /> Donnelly provides the reader with a richly authentic description of the era, with its limited vision of women's roles. Page by page, you will discover with Mattie the fate of the letter writer as you savor this richly satisfying novel.	2004-08-03

His account of the making of the Oxford English Dictionary, which took place over many decades and was the meaningful life-work of several dedicated men and many interested volunteers around the English-speaking world, will hold your interest and increase your appreciation for this huge endeavor.<br /><br /> Winchester has spoken of how he strives \\"not to be boring\\" and to avoid academese. You will find, upon finishing the reading of this or any of his other books, that you have painlessly taken in a great deal of information. Winchester's books are a joy, an extremely satisfying use of your reading time. Highly recommended.	2004-08-02

You will be swept back into the antebellum South, with all its contradictory conventions and entrenched attitudes that will seem so utterly foreign to many contemporary readers.<br /><br /> Many reviewers see Manon, the young white woman central character, as selfish, callous, and somewhat spoiled. I take another view; to me she seems pathetically limited, victimized by<br /> the gender attitudes of the time; an unhappy, struggling creature.<br /><br /> This novel is a jumble of strong feeling, swift and consequential actions, broken taboos of all sorts,all of which combine to make a rip-roarin' read.

O'Malley sees Yates as a classic victim of bipolar disorder, rather than the &quot;extreme&quot; postpartum depression for which she was being treated.<br /><br /> This book, exhaustively detailed and written in sometimes casual, conversational language, will keep you turning pages. When you finish you may decide that O'Malley's ideas are correct. The case she makes is not entirely convincing; many aspects of this tragedy remain mysterious. For readers who have been hungry for more details about the Yates family, their marriage, their devotion to a small eccentric cult, Andrea's homeschooling of her children, and other matters, O'Malley's book will feed that curiosity from her own perspective and conclusions.	2004-08-02

Some of the works are by obscure poets; others are by widely known, established writers.<br /><br /> &quot;Good Poems&quot; was recommended to me by a newspaper columnist who received it as a birthday gift.

Written in Ball's highly personal style, in which he injects his own thoughts and feelings into the narration, the book tells of Dawn's metamorphosis from his/her birth as a poor boy, son of a servant on a large English estate, to a society woman in Charleston. When Dawn marries a black man, she loses her position in Charleston circles. Later, when she purportedly gives birth to a daughter, she sets tongues wagging all over the city.<br /><br />  Was she actually the mother of the baby as she claimed? This is just one of the questions that surround eccentric, enigmatic Dawn. This fascinating book, a biography of an extraordinarily colorful life, is highly recommended.	2004-07-31

One viewpoint expressed in some of the previous reviews is that she was fortunate to advance, through her light-skinned good looks, into the corridors of wealth and influence.  Yet Cohen does still strongly identify herself with black experiences and causes.<br /><br />  An intelligent, ambitious woman, extremely self-possessed and poised, Cohen spent her childhood years in a housing project in Indiana, raised by her single mother.  A bevy of relatives loved and influenced Cohen as well.  In early adulthood she discovered that she had a true talent for interviewing people, and began her  career as a broadcast journalist.<br /><br />  Despite the conventional and sometimes rather stilted quality of the prose, Cohen's own voice emerges in this book, telling her remarkable story in a compelling way that keeps the reader turning pages.

The narrator takes you in and bears you along in a story that becomes ever more fancifully bizarre. When you reach the ending, which would seem bleak if not for the cotton-candy spun delight of the story, you take it in stride.<br /><br /> &quot;The Witches&quot; is not for the literal-minded child, but for children who can understand a story as an exercise in imagination, it is highly recommended.	2004-07-31

These qualities shine through in her book as well, as she honestly, painstakingly describes her ascending path, which was complicated by undiagnosed epilepsy for many years.<br /><br /> As a Lay Carmelite familiar with our own dark path of &quot;unknowing&quot;, I am saddened to read of her early years in the monastery, where she perhaps was undergoing a Carmelite experience which her superiors would or could not comprehend. Her spiritual dryness and emptiness in the midst of yearning for God, would be cardinal signs to one familiar with the works of John of the Cross and St. Teresa.<br /><br /> Armstrong in her maturity is now a wise, tolerant, devout woman who still searches for the ineffable among diverse cultural traditions. Her book will be rewarding for readers no matter what their spiritual path.	2004-07-31

If you have read \\"about\\" Teresa but put off reading the works of the saint herself, feeling it might be too formidable a task, have no fear.  She speaks of the highest mystical experiences in terms accessible to 21st century readers.  There are some cultural references and attitudes to be filtered, but over all, Teresa's tremendous pleasure in her loving relationship with  God, shines through.  Do not be put off by the distance of centuries; don't feel that Teresa is too holy to be comprehended.  Read the story of her life, and read her descriptions of the stages of a mystical spiritual journey leading to a marvelous knowledge of God, and an ineffable sharing with God.<br />  Teresa speaks to all of us, wherever we are in our faith journeys, whenever we live, whatever our state. Her writings are classic outpourings of a soul sometimes desolate, sometimes ecstatic, but always, dedicated to God.  Teresa defies category or analysis.  You must read her to experience her.	2004-03-25

It does bog down in places like the long explanation of Wolfe's feud with the New Yorker, which is more interesting to the writer himself than to the general reader.<br />  His analysis of the cultural traditions that went into the making of the Silicon Valley mentality, is sharp, deep, and probably accurate.<br />  The book includes a long novella which did not engage this reviewer with its theme, characters, or repetitive descriptions.<br />  Taken as a whole, Wolfe's book is alternately absorbing in some parts, tedious in others.

(It can be astonishingly refreshing to realize how many of us share the same problems, misunderstandings, and communication failures!)<br />This book will make you both smile, and you may find some healing touches in its pages, as well.

He possessed unparalleled vision and wisdom about the Carmelite experience, the \\"way of unknowing\\" that leads to our all-knowing God.<br />  His writings are challenging, wherever a person may be on his/her spiritual journey, but they are bounteously rewarding to the dedicated reader.  The human heart does not change, and you will be surprised how much the people of the 1500s resemble the people of 2004; you will also nod in agreement and amazement at the extreme accuracy of St. John's observations.<br />  Highly recommended to anyone interested in developing a deeper, more intimate relationship with God.	2004-03-16

If you come at this book from a &quot;retro, kitschy&quot; approach, you may be surprised.  (Or maybe not.  It does satisfy at that level also!)<br />  While the meatball recipes look as if they may all taste alike (and many do), they are quick, inexpensive, and do indeed fill up a hungry family.  The three criteria may be all that matters, some evenings, to a person-in-charge-of-dinner at the end of a frazzled day.  If your Trader Joe groceries are running low, turn to this book to find a &quot;step-back-in-time&quot; meal of oldtime American cuisine!	2004-03-03

To readers familiar with Hippocrates' notion of the four basic temperaments, there is no doubt about it: Laura Bush is the poster child of the phlegmatic nature.  She's the epitome of a stoic, self-contained woman who expends as little energy as possible in the course of living.<br />  Perhaps the most striking example of this (in addition to her &quot;late&quot; marriage by the early-Boomer standards of her time) is her &quot;hand-off&quot; attitude toward her adolescent daughters, a kind of detached resignation which has forced their father into an unlikely role as disciplinarian.<br />  &quot;Laura-Steady-as-she-goes&quot; is the extremely apt nickname given to her by father-in-law George.  An enigma even to the most gifted biographers, she's a tough subject.  Gerhart has done a little better than most, although she does reiterate some well-known facts of Bush's life. One of the most burning questions women might want answered is, why did she marry someone so far beneath her levels of intellect and emotional maturity?  &quot;He makes me laugh,&quot; Bush tells Gerhart, and uses the word &quot;laugh&quot; five times in one short response regarding her husband.  Somehow, this reader cannot identify and must conclude wonderingly, &quot;It must be a phlegmatic thing.&quot; (!)	2004-02-13

In the light of present day news stories of mad-cow disease, SARS, and other exotic ailments that possibly could pose a pandemic threat, Marriott's book is especially relevant.<br />  Marriott brings the rat-infested harbor area and the exceedingly crowded, poor districts of the city to vivid life.

I was impressed with her, as she is young looking and quick thinking into her ninth decade.<br />    Her story relates an unusual childhood, growing up in a small Tennessee town in the 20s and 30s where her immigrant parents ran a dry-goods business that catered to the lower income residents.  They were the only Jewish residents, occupying a unique niche in the life of the area.  Her sunny-natured, optimistic father flourished there, becoming southern in speech and outlook.  The adjustment was harder for her sensitive, traditional mother. For Stella and her older sister and brother, there was no question of adjustment, as life in Tennessee was the only life they knew,  and they were generally accepted and able to take root.<br />  Suberman is a wonderful writer, as one might expect for a &quot;retired editor&quot; of many years experience.  Her style is vividly descriptive, with a perfect balance of the characters'  inward and outward lives.  &quot;The Jew Store&quot; is a joy to read.  Suberman's book deserves the highest recommendation and will appeal to readers of all ages.	2004-01-27

It can be read on  several levels---even as a simple tale of good v. evil, of redemption after sin.<br />  This book will make your airport delays and your long flights seem much shorter, as Dean unwinds his tale of Fric, the bright but unbeautiful son of two extremely attractive, shallow entertainment- industry parents.  Fric is placed in peril by sinister forces, but with the help of former cop Ethan, who works for his movie-star father as security chief, he battles through.<br />  A word to the wise: Don't answer phone line 24, especially after dark!	2004-01-27

The book is seemlessly woven, filled with delicate turnings and impressions.<br />  She writes especially well of her narrator's first love, of the days of passion and sweetness that the 17 year old girl found with a boy &quot;from the wrong side of the tracks&quot; in the small Maine village which is the setting for the book.<br />  Highly recommended, &quot;More than You Know&quot; should propel the author into a wide readership.	2004-01-27

Like her first book, &quot;The Jew Store&quot;, this one is a joy to read, as Suberman is especially gifted at presenting a balanced account of the inner and outer lives of her characters.<br />  Suberman is a young bride, still in her teens, as the United States enters World War II, and her husband is an Air Force pilot.  Leaving her Florida home, she follows Jack to his postings around the country.  Her carefree days of sun and fun at Miami Beach are over, but she brings her high spirited resilience to the worries and deprivations of wartime life.<br /> The chapters are filled with  adventures, friendships, encountering prejudice,  the birth of the couple's first child, a son they name Rick for the Humphrey Bogart character in &quot;Casa Blanca&quot;.  The reader's interest will be maintained from first page to last, in this warm-hearted memoir.<br />  Highly recommended, especially for the fine quality of Suberman's writing.	2004-01-27

There is healing in the midst of ongoing struggle.  Proulx's work is fiction at its best, as she writes with the freedom of an imaginative, curious writer who discovers and poignantly expresses, the inner lives of her characters. You will experience life as each of her characters knows it, and you will come to epiphanies as they do.  Highly recommended.	2004-01-21

Reading his gem-like prose is a high pleasure that does not dip from the first page to the last of &quot;God's Secretaries.&quot;  His topic, suitably enough, is the sonorous, expressively phrased biblical translation we know as the King James version.  It is difficult to believe that this translation was the work of a committee, men of disparate views and widely differing temperaments.  One of the ironies of the KJV is that it was written to support the Anglican Church in its alliance with the British monarchy, in opposition to the rising Puritan/Calvinist influences in England.  Yet the KJ has become the version best known to generations of Americans, in fundamentalist churches throughout the U.S., who are in some respects heirs of the Puritan tradition in the New World.<br /><br /> Nicholson's book is rather loosely organized, with many anecdotal asides about the various translators, especially in describing their connections to each other across doctrinal lines.  In one chapter he dwells heavily on the attitude of some clergymen that the plague was God's vengeance, and that devout, pure people need not fear the disease.  (Interestingly enough, our modern term &quot;stroke&quot; probably originated from this time----some churchmen believed that an plague-stricken person was felled by God's stroke.)  In another chapter, Nicholson describes the sights, sounds, and smells of London and its sprawling suburbs (which were the slums, the counterpart to the&quot;inner city&quot; of today) with such detailed accuracy that the reader will see, hear, and smell what the Londoner of the early 1600s encountered.<br />&quot;God's Secretaries&quot; is a beautifully written, well-researched book that will bring delight to the general reader as well as to the religious scholar.  Kudoes to Nicholson, and the five-star rating to his work!	2003-12-29

So I had to struggle with my own preconceptions and prejudices as I began my research.&quot;<br />  Rule performed the research in her usual meticulous, exhaustive style, guided by both the facts and her own intuitive, expert insights derived from her long experience of investigating crimes.<br />  &quot;Heart Full of Lies&quot; emerges as a finely balanced look at the Oregon murder of Chris Northon, a Hawaiian Airlines pilot. His gifted, ambitious, troubled wife Liysa was accused of the crime. The case includes a large number or people who passionately defend Liysa and believe her account, that she was a victim of domestic abuse and feared for her own life and the lives of her two young sons; and another large group of people who, just as firmly, see Liysa as a cold-blooded killer.<br />  It is her own words, found on the hard drive of a computer she reported &quot;stolen&quot; but actually had placed in the possession of friends, that convict Liysa.  A prolific e-mailer, obssessive journal-keeper, and would-be screenwriter, Liysa poured out into words, her feelings about Chris and her plans to rid herself of  him.<br />  In addition to the computer evidence, Rule reconstructs the murder scene with the common-sense, familiar police-procedure evidence. For example, she points out that when Liysa shows up at a friend's house, after driving for four hours away from the campground where the struggles occured, she is still wet and bedraggled.  In the October night chill, she surely would have turned up the heat in her Ford Explorer, and her clothes would have dried. The only reasonable inference is, to win sympathy for her story, Liysa re-doused herself somewhere near her friend's house. From this and from many other facts of the scene, Rule comes to the undeniable conclusion that Liysa did indeed murder her husband.<br />  Rule's latest book is sure to please her existing legions of readers as well as draw in new ones. Highly recommended!ry, Liysa re-doused herself somewhere near her friend's house.

Kennedy	Books	5	6	9	N	N	first-hand account, simple and gripping	Nellie Connally's story of the fateful day in Dallas when John Kennedy was assassinated and her own husband, John Connally, was very seriously wounded, is a first-person account, simply written and gripping.  Especially interesting to readers like me, those of us who were never swept up by the Camelot myth, is her finely tuned, rather ambiguous depiction of Jacqueline Kennedy.  While she writes respectfully of Mrs. Kennedy, there are unmistakeable undertones of Connally's feelings that Jackie was rather aloof and off-putting, and not entirely considerate of other people.<br />  Connally's own hearty connectedness, her ease in her role of loving wife and devoted mother as well as First Lady of Texas, comes through strongly.  Here is a woman whom readers will<br />warm to as they read her account of that November afternoon. Connally put her memories into writing when they were still disturbingly fresh, then stowed the papers away in a drawer to save for her descendants.  Thirty years later she came across them again, and this eyewitness story was made available to all of us, as our nation still remains fascinated with the Dallas tragedy.  Recommended.	2003-12-02

Hazel has deep family roots in the beautiful area, famous for flavorful, aged whisky made in picturesque distilleries. Her homecoming reveals some of the details of her earlier life and a previous romance with the handsome Donald Brodie, whom Gemma is surprised to find, has never completely left Hazel's life.<br />  Crombie uses a flashback technique, quoting the diaries of two women in the late 1880s, to weave a tale of passion, fortune, and long-kept secrets.  The reader will be swept along as Gemma pieces together disparate evidence to solve a tragic murder, and as she comes to know her close friend Hazel on an even deeper level.

Unlike some of her earlier, lengthier works, this book moves quickly, as Chief Inspector Wexford deals with the disappearance of two local teenagers and their babysitter. On his own home front, he is puzzled and worried over his  adult daughter's choice of boyfriends; this counterplot is woven seamlessly into the main plot, in prime Rendell style.<br />  Rain and more rain falls; a deluge comes upon the area, complicating the investigation and darkening the moods of even the hardiest characters.  In true British fashion, they weather the storm; the sun returns, the mystery is solved, and the reader closes the book with a satisfied sigh. &quot;The Babes in the Woods&quot; is a good introduction to new Rendell readers, and is highly recommended to those who already have been enjoying her skillful plotting and agile prose.	2003-11-17

Populating the story are family and friends, dear to her, and a theme throughout (though understated) is her warm Irish pluck, that courage that enabled her to raise five children when she was left on her own as a young widow.  Clark is modest about her highly-honed writing ability; also, she never overplays her unfolding story.  Instead she carries the reader along in a highly competent, yet matter-of-fact style---it's like she's<br />refusing to take the role of heroine.  The woman we meet in these pages is modest, immensely likable, and still young in spirit after all these years and all these best sellers.  Clark's memoir deserves the highest recommendation.	2003-11-08

I'd like some of my friends on the right to read &quot;The Long Detour&quot; as it would educate them on how reforms like the eight-hour day, the laws banning child labor, the Pure Food and Drug laws, and unemployment insurance, which we all take for granted now, came to be enacted.  Socialists at the turn of the 20th century pushed through this legislation, from which all Americans benefit.<br /><br />  Contrary to the belief of some, the left in American politics has had formidable and continuing success, as many of its issues became incorporated into the two major party platforms, and then into law.<br /><br />  Weinstein devotes a portion of the book to a discussion of how the &quot;real existing socialism&quot;, which is what the Russians called their Soviet system, was not a fair trial of Karl Marx's socialist economy.  Readers may be shocked to read that Marx was not as opposed to capitalism as many believe; he saw it as a phase, a necessary transition.  In Russia this phase was lacking, as the Soviet Union struggled to go from pre-capitalist feudalism to industrialized socialism.  Vital infrastructures were missing, and corruption and failure were inevitable.<br />  In the last portion of &quot;The Long Detour&quot; Weinstein gives us a clear-eyed vision of how such thorny issues as universal health care, full and meaningful employment, and a downsized military budget, can be implemented. His final sentence reads, &quot;The next step is up to you.&quot;	2003-09-24

Even the recipes are more mundane----a quiche recipe you could find in a lot of cookbooks, a roast beef with burgundy recipe that has also been around a long time.<br />  Goldy Schulz' teenage son Arch is in a difficult period now, and readers will miss his tractable sweetness of earlier books.  Julian is in---catch this---JAIL as a murder suspect.  Goldy's best friend Marla appears infrequently, as does her stalwart cop husband, Tom.  For much of the book Goldy is on her own, trying to withdraw (without much success) from her twin pleasures of caffeine and chocolate, even as she  suffers from various injuries incurred in the course of her investigation of the murder.<br />  If you're new to the series, read some of the earlier books first to get to know Goldy, Tom, Arch and company.

In a dreamer's evocative prose, she tells the story of the severe tornado that struck Jackson, Mississippi, in the spring of 1966, destroying the Candlestick Shopping Center. Hemingway, a girl of 10 at the time, had moved away shortly before the storm came.<br />  More than thirty years later, she returned to there to claim her own memories, and to record the recollections of people whose lives had been forever changed, some by the loss of a family member, some by witnessing sites that burned upon their souls. When they see the sky taking on that peculiar yellow tinge, when they hear the sirens, their bodies respond with pounding hearts, shallow breathing, goosebumps.  They react not only to the sight and sounds, but to their own memories.<br />  Suffused with that sense of place which other southern writers also express so well, with the scents, sounds, sights of that region called &quot;home&quot;, Hemingway's book will transport you to the Jackson she knew as a child, and to that March afternoon when the familiar world was turned upside down.<br />  This book deserves a wide readership!

This is certainly true for caterer Goldy, who cooks and serves no matter what or where.<br />The wedding does not happen as planned.  The priest is found murdered, and the groom, police officer Tom Schulz, disappears.  For much of the action in this book, Goldy is on her own, worrying about Tom, focused on finding him.  There is more tension for Goldy in &quot;The Last Suppers&quot; than in any of the books of the series,  but she carries on and the plot will carry you along with her.<br />Recommended as a page-turner!	2003-08-25

You will stay awake reading.  Hodel's<br />conclusion that his father and another man were serial killers of attractive, vulnerable women, will chill you. Unlike some<br />others who wrote about the Black Dahlia, Hodel views her with a sympathetic eye, feeling that she was a young woman who<br />wanted what most do---a loving husband, a home, children. Adrift in post-WWII era Los Angeles, she encountered instead<br />George Hodel, and met a violent end at a young age.<br /><br />Hodel is to be commended for his long, meticulous search for the facts, for his own hunches on how to put the facts together,<br />and for his brutal honesty as it became increasingly clear in his own mind, that his father had been responsible for the death<br />of the Dahlia and probably for many other murders.	2003-08-14

He challenges the three \\"received\\" theories, \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", \\"Noble Savage\\", and \\"Blank Slate\\", and with unparalleled clarity of both thinking and writing, examines the gaps and weaknesses of each one.<br />  Without belaboring his points, he presents a defense of the findings of socio-biology and evolutionary psychology that detractors will find extremely difficult to refute. Pinker's approach is even-handed and rational, contrasting sharply with the convoluted, zealous attitudes of \\"Blank-Slaters\\" on both the right and left, who would force us to believe that nurture and culture are everything, and inheritable traits do not enter into a person's nature and development.<br />  Common sense tells us that they do. As Pinker sprinkles his erudite work with pop culture examples, so I will use slang to sum up a dismissal of nurture-zealots of political/social theory:  \\"Who ya gonna believe?  Your dearly held theories or our 'lying' eyes?\\"<br />  In my husband's work as a cloud physicist, he has encountered pet theories, encrusted with years and egos, which place obstacles in the path of true, bias-free research. It takes courage and strength to \\"cut through the crap\\" to replace it with clear vision and an open, balanced approach.  Highest kudoes to Steven Pinker!	2003-07-16

Along the way, he subtly jabs &quot;political correctness&quot;, and its humorless polemic which has warped the literary canon as he sees it.  For the most part I agree with him, that many lauded works today are simply not worth the time it takes to read them, however earnest the authors, however solemn their causes.<br />  Bloom may oversimplify when he classifies modern writers by those authors of the past who seem to influence their works, whether Shakespeare, Cervantes, or others.

As a long time family chef, I find myself identifying much more with Goldy.  No matter what else is going on, no matter how little sleep she manages to get, Goldy preps and cooks on a regular basis.

Sarah Ban Breathnacht has written it with the best of intentions, guiding the reader to seek abundance by simplifying her life.<br /><br />  It seems to this reviewer that following her suggestions would only replace one kind of clutter with another.  Style is another major concern of Ban Breathnacht as she urges each woman to find her own authentic self. Yet she seems to be concerned as much with outer trappings and appearance as with inner attitudes and values.<br />  Given this dichotomy, the book has a schizophrenic orientation throughout and may provide the thoughtful reader with a few laughs which the author did not intend.	2003-05-17

This is a \\"heavy-weight\\" romantic tale, with thick literary allusions froms start to finish. From the punning character names to the classical references studded in its long Victorian poems, \\"Possession\\" will require your close attention.<br /><br /> Although the book introduces us to two sets of lovers, one modern and one Victorian couple, the tone throughout is Victorian. Even as the current couple deals with their commitment-phobia and their \\"post-Romantic\\" frame of reference,<br />their own story becomes caught up in the passions and constraints of the Victorian lovers.<br /><br /> Christabel LaMotte is determined to have her own life and to practice her literary art, yet she encounters a dragon in the person of Randolph Ash. Her love for him ambushes her, and its consequences undermine her lofty pursuits. Yet years later she tells him, \\"If there had to be a dragon, I'm glad it was you.\\"<br /> Slogging through the ornately written poems and the dense prose of the letters Christabel and Ash exchanged may make you feel you are in a classroom again, not reading for pleasure.

Since the great Chicago fire occured the same day, the Peshtigo conflagration has been overlooked in American history, until now. Gess and Lutz, co-authors of &quot;Firestorm at Peshtigo&quot;, have produced a graphic account drawn from survivors.  The fire, fueled by dry conditions from a long drought and whipped into tremendous intensity by tornado-like winds, &quot;moved faster than the time it takes to write these words.&quot;<br />  The town was gone in less than an hour, reduced to ashes, with widespread, nearly instantaneous loss of life.  This tale is not for the faint-hearted as Gess and Lutz pull no punches in describing the scenes of devastation.  Since earlier fires had destroyed telegraph lines from the remote mining town, the rest of the nation learned little of the fate of Peshtigo, and the disaster there was overshadowed by the Chicago fire of the same date (and the boosterism and rebuilding of its aftermath).  Gess and Lutz have restored a page of midwestern history in this engrossing book.  Highly recommended.	2003-04-23

His tone throughout is modest and unassuming, and each stage is presented according to his maturity level as he grew up.  His mother's high expectations set a high bar for Baker through his growing up years, and must have contributed to his successful eventual career at the New York Times.<br />  &quot;Growing Up&quot; is carefully crafted by this experienced writer, yet reads as if he had effortlessly put together this a seamless memoir.

A secret facility \\"outside Reno\\", Crichton tells us, is the scene for the nonstop plot. (As a northern Nevadan, I must object that Crichton seems to have confused our climate with that of southern Nevada outside Vegas. Our \\"high-mountain\\" desert just isn't as fierce as the one he describes!)<br /><br /> Crichton does the domestic scenes well, as \\"house-husband\\" Jack Forman, between jobs as a hightech computer programmer, struggles with family routines and unruly children in his new role. He writes in the voice of one who has been there, and women will appreciate the authenticity.<br /><br /> The pace is trademark-fast, the suspense is intriguing, and there are surprises throughout. \\"Prey\\" is another good one from<br />Crichton's ever-fertile imagination.

It is divided into sections on managers, pitchers, hitters, and defensive play.  Will states that baseball is about paying attention, about the myriad details that make up each pitch, each play, each out.<br /><br /> At times the book bogs down into a tech manual, giving even the most enthusiastic readers a little too much detail; at other times Will's rightwing political bias does emerge in the guise of a discussion of a strong work ethic, individual initiative for personal gain, and nostalgic idealization of the past.<br />But taken as a whole, &quot;Men at Work&quot; is a paean to what used to be called &quot;America's favorite pastime&quot;.  Will demonstrates why baseball appeals on many levels to a wide range of people.  As a lifelong fan, someone who has never tired of the game because however lopsided the score, there is always something to pick up on (see Tony LaRussa's quote above), I recommend the book to readers of all ages.	2003-04-22

He presents anecdotes drawn from real life, familiar and easily identifiable, to make his points about living well and doing good in the world.  Christians will be comfortable with every page of the book, although they may get a sense that Kushner's extremely rational portrayal of God makes Him emotionally distanced.	2003-04-22

The author, Henri Charriere, called &quot;Papillon&quot; because of the butterfly tattooed on his chest, was wrongfully convicted in a French court in 1931 and sent to a penal colony in French Guinea to serve his sentence.  He is determined to escape, and the book takes us through many attempts until at last he attains his freedom and begins a new life in Venezuela.  The book is full of heroes and villains---good people who befriend him and treat him decently, and cruel, sadistic people who make his miserable life even more so.  Charriere's tone throughout is honest, rarely self-pitying, and unsparing in its depiction of feelings as well as actions.<br />  &quot;Papillon&quot; is marred only by its misconceptions and dated, wrong ideas, especially about health and nutrition.  Also, women readers may find the constant diet of adventure with only rare mentions of his loved ones back in France, and of the two children he fathered by girls of a welcoming native tribe, rather unsatisfying.  One further jarring note is, as in true in prisons today, apparently a high percentage of the inmate population claim they are &quot;innocent&quot;--a concept that stretches Charriere's credibility.	2003-04-15

Rule is at the top of her form as she writes compassionately, with her remarkable insights and apt phrases.  She captures the character of Dr. Anthony Pignataro, whose grossly swollen ego caused him to disregard other people entirely and led to grave injury, and even death, for his surgical patients. Eventually even his wife became a victim, as he attempted to poison her with ant-killing arsenic.  Rule's compelling narrative will rivet you to your chair with her description of the suffering of his wife, both physical and emotional, as she slowly realizes who is responsible for her<br />months of extremely painful, crippling illness.  Unlike the victims whose stories Rule has brought us before, Debbie Pignataro lives, and all readers will be uplifted by her strength and courage.<br />  Also included in the book are more stories from Rule's files of murders in western Washington, one dating back more than fifty years.  Each one is told with Rule's trademark advocacy for the victims, who were silenced by their killers.  Through the pen of this gifted writer they speak to us.  Highly recommended.	2003-02-04

The genius of her writing lies in  attention and enjoyment of small things: Her description of a happy union is &quot;an eye to catch across the table.&quot;<br />  Ysenda Maxtone-Graham is to be commended for her own attention to the small matters that make up a rich life, with its full texture of joys and sorrows.

The section on \\"potted meats\\" belongs in that category, as do the food market and restaurant prices she lists in many of the pieces.<br /><br />  You will find here David's writing about Mediterranean cooking which established her as an authority, and which opened up traditional British-style \\"cookery\\" with a new emphasis on simple, fresh ingredients.  Included throughout the book are essays on presentation with continental flair, which can add to the enjoyment of meals.<br />  \\"Mrs. Beeton,\\" the guide for English cooks and household managers for nearly a hundred years, had been viewed by many as an elderly lady in a starched-stiff, black dress who dispensed advice on the \\"proper\\" way to cook.  In David's book, she presents the real Mrs. Beeton-- a young matron in her twenties, brisk, practical and innovative.<br />  You may not feel inspired to try all the recipes David brings to us, but you will be intrigued by her enthusiastic style and her chatty British approach.	2003-01-21

For many decades the British were known for what might tactfully be called &quot;plain cooking&quot;---overdone roasts, vegetables boiled beyond recognition, oversweet, gooey desserts.  In her eight books and in her columns, David enthusiastically re-introduced the British to fresh vegetables, delicate sauces, simple desserts, and flavorful, whole-grain bread.<br />  At the age of 16, this daughter of the landed gentry was sent to France for a cultural education and came home with a lifelong passion for good cooking. &quot;Is There a Nutmeg in the House&quot; is a complilation of her writings from forty years, some of which has not been published before.<br />  David's writing style is recognizably British, opinionated, chatty, not excessively organized, and a bit &quot;fussy&quot;, for want of a better term.  This only added to the pleasure of reading her, for this reviewer; although a person used to the standard American format for providing recipes, with the ingredients listed in the order of combination, and step by step instruction, will not find that in David.<br />  Elizabeth David was a national treasure for England, and her lifelong passion for &quot;cookery&quot;  earns her a place on the bookshelf of many American kitchens as well.	2003-01-10

Barbara Michaels spins a bodice-ripper tale that is far above the ordinary.  Using her fine ear for dialogue, her quick and accurate characterizations, and solid plotting, she quickly engages the reader's interest and empathy.<br />  In Michaels' trademark &quot;end beyond the ending&quot;, further events spill forward just as you think you've reached the conclusion of the tale.

They are presented in their best light, although Andersen does include the most memorable of George's verbal gaffes and does explore his earlier behavior as an aimless, hard-drinking young man.<br />  Even though he relied heavily on Laura's mother, Jenna Welch, for stories and insights, Andersen has some difficulty delineating the enigmatic character of the First Lady. Her self-contained, phlegmatic temperament is not easily captured, although it is easy to see how her calmness has steadied her emotional husband, whom no one would call a deep thinker.<br />  As in every love story, there is a mystery at its core.  What drew these two together and what sustains them through years and trials?  Andersen does a good job of showing how completely opposite they are, and how they have made these differences work for them in their marriage, rather than against them, as often happens after the honeymoon is over.  George seems to be an appreciative husband; many women would envy Laura this quality in her spouse.  Laura seems to be an accepting, completely loyal wife who rarely complains, even though she does voice her opinions.<br />  One would hope that Laura's opinions continue to influence her husband to &quot;rein in it, Bubba&quot;, as she once told him, and to pursue a course of wise restraint as opposed to his own bellicose, ill-considered attitudes to our present crisis.	2002-12-18

He relied to a great<br />extent on the lawyers involved, and on the parents and<br />sister of Eric's first wife, Tracy.<br />Tracy Thomas, who was 6 months pregnant, died in a crash of a Ford Explorer<br />she was driving en route to the hospital with<br />her sick baby and husband, Eric. The crash did not seems severe enough to<br />cause a fatality. Eventually her husband Eric<br />brought suit against the Ford Motor Company, claiming that the Explorer air<br />bag caused Tracy's death, and that of her<br />unborn child.<br />There is much court dialogue in Schiller's book, and readers (unlike myself)<br />who enjoy that may find it engrossing. Probably<br />because Eric and Stephanie denied the author access, neither of them comes<br />to vivid life, and the narrative suffers as a result.<br />The case remains unresolved, with Tracy's parents now bringing a \\"wrongful<br />death\\" suit against Eric, as some evidence<br />suggests Tracy may have been strangled rather than died as a result of the<br />crash.<br />Schiller's book is a written in workmanlike, journalistic style that didn't<br />fully engage me. This is a story that could rivet a<br />reader's attention, given a livelier approach.	2002-12-12

Each articulately written paragraph can be savored and will be food for thought.<br /> Martin's historical perspective may open your eyes to such observations as that of Charles Dickens, who noted that southern ladies spoke like their black nurses. Martin notes that the slaves may have been well-mannered aristocrats in their own African societies, while the plantation owners may have come from lowly origins.<br /> She also writes of the task the Founding Fathers undertook: In setting up a new, democratic nation, of necessity they had to set up a new system of etiquette, one suited for a nation of equals. American etiquette is still evolving, as we live in a nation where every person is free to \\"make something of oneself\\",<br />instead of being locked into a stagnant system of codes and behavior related to rigid economic class. American virtues, like enterprise, frankness, and friendliness, sometimes can present challenges to the polite restraint necessary to civilized behavior. Even the essential ideas of etiquette--being thoughtful of others and according them respect---can require careful calibration in such matters as being asked to buy an item you don't want just because a friend's child is selling it to benefit an organization.<br /> Kudoes to Judith Martin for another enlightening and fascinating book! Highly recommended.	2002-12-06

Many of the essays also bring to mind a quote from \\"A Midwife's Tale\\" by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Martha Ballard, a real-life colonial midwife, finds that after an overnight childbirthing, \\"Came home at 10 a.m. to find my house up in arms against me. Did not sit down till 2 p.m.\\" Many women will smile ruefully, as I do, at that diary quotation.<br /> As someone who entered college when older attitudes still held sway, and who left graduate school as feminists ideas began to take root, my college friends and I have a foot in both worlds. In negotiating with our spouses about who would play what role in our households, we made differing arrangements. No one has found a perfect solution.<br /> Recent research in sociobiology, which cannot be denied no matter how much hard-core feminists scoff at it, has shown that physiologically,hormonally,and emotionally, women are geared to be the nurturers. Freud was of course incorrect when he baldly stated, \\"Biology is destiny,\\" and in every recent generation, bright women have made their mark. It seems that every generation has had to negotiate and--yes, that ugly word---compromise. From reading these essays one would conclude that for these women under 40, the negotiations have not gone well. Perhaps some ancient folk wisdom needs to be applied, along with the most recent socio-biological data. Women need an opportunity to be fully themselves, and so do men, but neither gender has the right to expect the other to behave like its opposite. If that occurs, much anger and bitterness will follow. I probably will be criticized for saying these truths, but anyone reading \\"The Bitch in the House\\" will find ample evidence to support this position.<br /> In a successful marriage and in successful parenting, it seems, negotiations need to be ongoing, with forgiveness, restraint, and acceptance expressed on both sides.ss, restraint, and acceptance expressed on both sides.	2002-11-27

Like the other great books of the disaster genre, like Walter Lord's \\"Titanic\\" and the Jim Bishop books about presidential assassinations, \\"Killer 'Cane\\" takes the reader right into the scene: Belle Glade, Florida Everglades, 1928, when a monstrous hurricane swept in without warning.<br /> Mykle gives us a large cast of real-life people, and fills us in on their stories, on what had brought them to the area, on their aspirations for a future which for many, never came. It's a slight bit confusing as he jumps around to scenes from the past, juxtapositioning them with the current life of the area and its characters. That said, it's satisfying to piece it all together. As an absorbing movie does, this book engages us with the characters and causes us at times to hold our breath as we await the outcome of their fates. Mykle writes well, using a wide vocabulary and an authentic descriptive style to present not only the people, but the land, and then the storm, as well. This book will keep you riveted until you finish it. Kudoes to Mykle, and the highest recommendation for his work.	2002-11-17

Linda Greenlaw's \\"Lobster Chronicles\\" is selling briskly and appearing on best seller lists. Her first book, \\"The Hungry Ocean\\", also sold extremely well, no doubt capitalizing on the success of the book and movie, \\"The Perfect Storm\\", in which her character was featured, and on the highly promoted tv showing of the film.<br /> Greenlaw is her own person, and feminists will no doubt applaud her, in spite of her baldfaced admission that she yearns for children, a house of her own, and some of the traditional gender roles feminists spurn. Her path has been an unusual one, and her plainstyled writing is expressive enough to make us understand that it has been a satisfying life. Sadly, her book is less than a satisfying read as her straightforward writing often fails to capture color and interest.<br /><br /> Throughout, the reader can sense that she is attempting her best to portray eccentric Islanders, to convey her own varying emotional states, to write of her father's love and her mother's bright courage. Perhaps this book was rushed to print? Maybe better editing would have put some zest into it.	2002-11-17

As a piano teacher, I've found that it provides fun for my young students.  They can thumb through it and play page after page of marvelous classical melodies, incorporating their own chords.  That's a great introduction to classical pieces which stimulates their interest in the original versions.<br /> Some pianists may turn up their noses at the idea of a classsical fake book, but I'd point out that many of these pieces were originally written for orchestra, or--in the case of the older ones--for harpsichord, clavichord, organ, and so on.  Some are taken from operas.  Indeed, many of the classical works we use with our students are arrangements rather than ur-texts.<br /> My students and I often laugh at the term \\"fake book\\"; especially for the keyboard players, these books would be more accurately named \\"creative books.\\"  The performer is called upon to provide his/her own harmony arrangements and rhythmic patterns.  For talented musicians, \\"fake books\\" are a great opportunity for creative expression.  That said, it must also be emphasized that students must have a strong foundation in piano basics, and that the teaching of ur-texts is vital for any student.<br />  We love the \\"Classical Fake Book\\"---a hoot and a half!

In &quot;Authentic Happiness&quot; he describes how to strengthen your character in order to develop these life-affirming virtues.  Unlike traditional psychotherapy, which revolves around a &quot;talking cure&quot; and seeks to identify traumatic events in a person's past, and even to assign blame, Seligman's Positive Psychology focuses on developing your &quot;signature strengths&quot;, and on learning what you will find genuinely fulfilling in life.<br />Using personal anecdotes in addition to well-documented (and in some cases, surprising) studies, he demonstrates how we can avoid being trapped by the downward spiral of negativity and depression.  This is a remarkable book that defies classification.  It should not be limited to the &quot;self-help&quot; genre, as Seligman goes far beyond that to introduce a new way of thinking about individual potential.  Highly recommended.	2002-11-01

British author Alexander McKee writes his account in straightforward, journalistic style, avoiding any temptation to sensationalize the dramatic story.<br /> As one might expect, the extreme situation brought out the best in some persons, the worst in others. Men on a barely seaworthy raft, in water up to their waists, eventually had to resort to cannibalism to remain alive.<br /> McKee presents the full story to us, replete with human error, arrogance, cowardice, and heroism, endurance, and faith. In the final chapters of the book he relates other stories of shipwrecks and plane wrecks, such as the famous crash of the rugby team high in the Andes in 1972. He compares these disasters with the Medusa situation.<br /> Although his style seems rather pedestrian at times, I suspect he deliberately wrote this way to present the story factually and completely. \\"Death Raft\\" belongs on the list of any reader who enjoys true-life sea stories.	2002-10-24

Policewoman Gemma James, whom we have met in earlier Crombie novels, is pregnant with the child of her lover, Duncan Kincaid.  He finds a lovely place in Notting Hill to become home to their blended families, including the coming child.<br />  The first murder victim, Notting Hill resident Dawn Arrowsmith, is also pregnant with her lover's baby; her husband, wealthy antique dealer Karl, had a vasectomy years ago.(Those readers who saw the Julia Roberts/Hugh Grant film, \\"Notting Hill\\", can easily visualize the gentrified neighborhood.)<br />  As usual with Crombie's work, the plot quickly thickens and the  reader's interest will intensify accordingly.  Several mother/child relationships are uncovered as Gemma pursues the killer.  (I wonder if Crombie herself was pregnant while writing this book.  One would think so.)<br />  \\"And Justice There is None\\" is a  mystery done up to perfection, including authentic British-English (Car Park for parking lot, Inland Revenue for IRS, mobile for cell phone, and so on) despite the fact that Crombie lives in Texas.

She has a light touch but it is underlined with authority; she writes humorously but her topics are serious. Firmly, gently, and unerringly, she writes of how to behave in every situation. (She could have been the quintessential Southern Belle of an earlier era.)<br />  As I learned in my midwestern girlhood, the most important rule of etiquette is to make people feel comfortable, to think of others, to be tactful and kind.  Miss Manners has this goal in mind as she writes on such diverse topics as answering machines and call waiting, entertaining in-laws and dealing with family differences, and being a good house guest.  Politeness and courtesy lubricate all social relations, and social relations may sometimes be taxing but are utterly necessary to our mental and emotional health.  This is Miss Manners' well-articulated creed.<br />  As a mother who has raised four teenagers, I especially liked her attitude toward laying down the law in adolescent years:  Give your children something to rebel against, as they need this desperately.  At some level they will recognize this as a sign that parents do care about them, and as they mature they will begin to realize that setting limits is what loving parents do.<br />  This advice to parents about teens is a good example of the tongue-in-cheek wisdom of Miss Manners, presented in an entertaining way. Her book is lengthy but the pages fly by because of her light, friendly approach.  Highly recommended.	2002-10-16

Beginning with his chapter, \\"The Invention of Cooking\\", and ending with a discussion of the fast food industry, his scholarly yet opinionated approach is thought-provoking. He debunks several widely held beliefs, such as the importance of the spice trade and its role in the voyages of European explorers.<br /> Also interesting is his attitude that sugar, salt, and fat are not villains in destroying health: He cites small percentages of people who are vulnerable to high cholesterol and heart disease, but says that for most people, consumption of these three food items should not be an issue.<br /> He writes of the \\"Columbian exchange\\" of animals and crops between the New World and the Old; of how the six major grain crops came to be grown, and where; of how colonization produced mixed cuisines.<br /> \\"Near a Thousand Tables\\", a blend of fact and opinions, is sure to provide excellent dinner table discussions with your friends.<br />Gathering round the cooking fire is an ancient human pleasure, one that endures despite the rise of microwave single-serving meals and hectic family schedules.

His engaging style effortlessly incorporates important details into the narrative.  We are transported back to 1954,  back to the era of post-war prosperity and the rise of the suburbs.<br />  The story of  osteopathic doctor Sam Sheppard, who was convicted of his wife Marilyn's violent death and who served many years in prison before being released, re-tried and acquitted, is widely known.  Neff's probing reveals that many people still hold misperceptions about the case.<br />  In true Perry Mason style, Neff introduces us to the real perpetrator, and provides an in-depth look at his troubled life. Using scientific evidence as well as psychological insights, he leads us to his conclusion about how and why Marilyn Sheppard was murdered on that Fourth of July nearly half a century ago.<br />  Neff's book is a first-rate true crime tale, highly recommended.	2002-10-11

In it I encountered a \\"woman's blend\\" of romance, mystery, and suspense that seemed initially engaging. There was also a big element of \\"action/violence\\" that seemed to have strayed from another genre.<br /> McKinney's Louisiana \\"downhome\\" sayings are fresh and unjaded, and her language escapes cliches. The love/sex scenes are well portrayed with the right touches of physical allure and emotional involvement.<br /> In spite of her deft phrases and skillful dialogue, I found \\"Still of the Night\\" too formulaic, as if conforming to a careful outline with a strange spin intended to appeal to women and men alike. From its promising opening pages, I expected another kind of book. I missed the integrity of a full-hearted, cleaner romantic novel it could have been.	2002-10-08

The book, printed on glossy paper, is visually appealing.  Jo Hammett's description of her childhood years, when her father's presence was a treat and time spent with him seemed magical, must be weighed against her growing realization that her parents were hopelessly mismatched, that her father was an intensely private man who shared his life with no one, not even his long-time mistress, Lillian Hellman.<br /><br /> Her father found his niche in American publishing, and is beloved by many readers devoted to his hard-boiled style.  His family life, or the lack of it, may take some of the sheen from his image.  A pervasive sadness invades this book.	2002-10-07

Hampered by the lack of documents, she persisted in her search to understand their lives, beginning with the suicide of Josephine, which left Pepi, the author's grandmother, an orphan at the age of 8.<br />  Graced by skilled writing and an unerring sense of what is important, Epstein's book will lead you also on a journey into the lives of these women, which were molded and constrained by attitudes towards women's roles, by prejudice against Jews, by displacements and ultimately by the camps of the Holocaust.<br />  The emotionally wrenching story of Epstein's investigation into her family past will affect you deeply.  I liked the photo of her mother, smiling broadly, holding toddler Helen loosely in her arms, as if to launch her into the much wider, much safer opportunities of life in the United States.	2002-10-05

Although it was written soon after the events of that date, before all of the relevant facts had emerged, Chomsky's sure and articulate grasp of the situation makes for enlightening reading.<br /><br /> Chomsky writes at length about the plight of the innocent, war-torn Afghanis, and about the people of many other countries, like Nicaragua and Haiti, who have been victimized by US policies. Reading his account should give pause to Americans who may be swept up in patriotic flag-waving and the ill-considered, narrow rhetoric of Bush and his advisors like Rumsfeld.<br /> Chomsky takes a world view and strives for an informed, balanced outlook. He writes of the extreme importance of not being intimidated or swayed by hysterical ranting or lies; to stay as closely as possible to the path of truth and honesty, and to acknowledge the human consequences of our acting, or failing to act.<br /> This book is must-reading for all concerned Americans.

The world has come to my town, also. Pipher writes, &quot;Most of my friends were of European background.  As I've made friends with people of Mideastern, Latino, African, and Southeast Asia backgrounds, I've changed a great deal.  I've stopped seeing myself as a member of a majority culture.  Instead, I see myself as a member of a world culture that flourishes in my hometown.&quot;  That has been my experience exactly.<br />  Especially interesting is her chapter on how American-style psychotherapy is not the method many of the refugee peoples use to heal from past traumas.  She quotes a saying of her mother's: &quot;There are three cures for all human pain and all involve salt--the salt of tears, the salt of sweat from hard work, and the salt of the great open seas.&quot;  (She points out that, while once she interpreted the &quot;seas&quot; as an escape from family or memory, now she sees it as the beauty of the natural world.)<br />  Pipher believes that young people adjusting to the American lifestyle should carefully choose to incorporate the best of their cultural heritage with the best of what America offers. (The pervasive media advertising and marketing, and all types of sleaze, for example, should be rejected. Family and community, shared meals, fun, love and laughter, should be cherished.)  She celebrates the energy and the optimism of these newest Americans.<br />  In a carefully reasoned discussion, she upholds the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and firmly maintains we are not practicing cultural bias when we seek to implant these basic rights all over the world.<br />  Hats off to Mary Pipher, one of our own culture's wise women, a down-to-earth midwesterner who eats a lot of pie, and a world citizen whose heart is open to all.  This book may stir you to become a cultural broker yourself, and you'll find your life enriched beyond measure.

The cast of real-life characters rivals any fictional story, and Ruddick's carefully crafted reconstruction of the death of Charles Bravo will keep you turning pages. He presents a strong case for his theory of events, although there are still no definite answers. His insights into the lives and motives of the suspects are  well written.<br /><br /> This slice of Victorian life among the English wealthy class will open your eyes to the then prevailing attitudes about women, gender roles, property rights, and family life of that era. Women's lives were circumscribed by rigid norms, and those few who went against those norms, like Florence Bravo, the young wife of the dead man, faced strong sanctions. Highly recommended, an excellent read.	2002-09-13

Both are tales of horror, courage and survival, presented in simple, strong prose which seems almost matter-of-fact at times, yet has a powerful effect on the reader. The topic is timely, as daily more victims come forward to charge those who sexually abused them as children. D'Haene's book is a message of courage, hope, and survival to those struggling with the long-reaching psychological consequences of sexual abuse at the hands of someone they trusted.<br /> D'Haene was only five years old when his father, an intelligent but deeply troubled man, introduced him to \\"the game\\". In time, his older brother and younger sister also became victims of their father's incestuous perversion. The parents were Belgian immigrants and the family, Jehovah's Witnesses in a small community in Ontario, lived an insular, isolated life-style. When, after years, the religious community became aware of his father's behavior, they \\"disfellowshipped\\" him and viewed it as sin, but not as a matter that should be taken to law enforcement.It was not until D'Haene was grown that his father was charged and tried for his crimes.<br /> D'Haene writes of his own ongoing struggles with issues of trust, sexual orientation, and feelings of being an outcast, and also of his attempts to help his mother and siblings both economically and emotionally. Despite its bleak subject matter, \\"Father's Touch\\" is a survivor's healing, positive account of how he was able to salvage a meaningful, happy life from the wreck of his early years. Highly recommended.	2002-09-13

That said, readers who suffer from extreme overweight and its many attendant health problems, can take heart in Wilson's heartfelt narrative.<br />  Born to a father famous in the pop music world and a loving, supportive mother, Carnie is a good-looking, personable woman who tells her story in a straight-forward, although slightly repetitive fashion.  Parents, be forewarned about the casual attitude toward sex and drugs.  Wilson's prose is laced with L.A. slang and profanity which no doubt reflects her speech, so that the book has an informal conversational tone.  She is frank about her internal struggles, about feeling unloved by her father, and about fearing the surgery that transformed her life.<br />  She has bid farewell to double cheeseburgers, fries and onion rings now, and, judging from the \\"after\\" photographs, she looks vibrantly happy and healthy.	2002-09-10

Since the events of last September, many Americans have returned to the \\"cocooning\\" joys of family life, and comfort food meals. Frankly, despite the lures of exotic recipes and of the latest fad wonder diets, many of us have always used these American classics as staple family menus.<br /><br /> The photography is gorgeous, and guaranteed to make your mouth-water and head you toward the kitchen. The recipes do require some actual kitchen time and preparation, but as most mothers can tell you, sometimes preparing comfort food is a solace in itself. Experienced cooks will be able to use microwave shortcuts, although these recipes are stove-top and oven in design.<br /> This book can also serve as a coffee-table book because these perennially popular American dishes, so artfully photographed, constitute an art form. Now how about tying on an apron and putting together a coconut custard pie for dessert this evening!  Recommended.	2002-08-30

Having spent some time at the East Anglia seaside several years ago, I am familiar with this setting, which James describes in her usual succinct yet colorful style.

The book will help to give early-intermediate students confidence and will build their repertoire.<br /> That said, some of the chords are overly simplified and produce some real clunking harmonies. You will find yourself altering some of the basic chords in order to get the sound you want. For example, \\"Leavin' on a Jet Plane\\" features a C chord several times going against a melody F. For some students, I have to tell them to play a C only in the left hand, not the full chord. For more advanced students, we change the C chord to a D diminished, which leads into a discussion of the use of diminished chords.<br /> With these reservations, I still highly recommend this book since you or your students will find many songs that are easily played and enjoyed.	2002-08-28

Pa would play his fiddle, and Ma would sit sewing in the evenings, and all was well.  This book describes the beginning years of Laura and Almanzo Wilder's life together, and it was a difficult period.<br />  Both Laura and Almanzo suffer from diptheria, a very serious illness at the time.  Laura later gave birth to the couple's second child, a son whose life was so brief that he apparently remained unnamed. After his death, during a period when Laura must have been distraught and inattentive (although this is not spelled out), there is a fire which destroys the house Almanzo has so lovingly and carefully built.<br />  Their troubles and losses eventually lead to a re-location to the Ozarks in Arkansas, far from Ma and Pa and the family circle of sisters, although that move is outside the scope of the book.<br />  \\"The First Four Years\\", despite lyrical passages, describes the end-of-innocence in Laura Wilder's life.

This sprawling novel was her sole work, but what a book!  Two of the leading protagonists, Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler, are perhaps the best known fictional characters in American literature.  The saintly Melanie Wilkes and her reticent husband Ashley are also widely recognized.<br />  Northern writers have yet to produce a comparable work.  Mitchell's novel plugs into the antebellum nostalgia of the south.

Later they are joined by Montague's wife, an ardent spiritualist and ouija board devotee, and her bluff, hearty friend.<br />  With a set of characters like this, Jackson's compact novel cannot fail to intrigue and satisfy.

At its close you will know the hearts of its four major characters.	2002-08-23

As always, the heroine is young, plucky, a bit naive but willing to learn.  The plot device here is a haunted quilt.<br />  Michaels is an accomplished writer whose characters are well-fleshed out, whose plots are timely, whose dialogue rings true.  Some readers prefer her archaeology novels written under another name, but I like her Michaels novels better.<br />  &quot;Stitches in Time&quot; is a great rainy-day, read-on-the-couch book and if it's your introduction to the author, it will lure you into getting more of her books.	2002-08-23

If you are looking for the best, read Sandburg on Lincoln.  A major American poet takes on one of the best-known, best-loved, most tragic of American historical figures.<br />  When I was a freshman in high school, our English teacher offered us a deal:  Anyone who read Sandburg's biography (then in six rather daunting volumes) would not have to attend class for a semester.  I took him up on that offer, and was blessed to find my way through Sandburg's gift to the American people.  Here is the highly detailed, thoroughly researched, and articulately written story of Abe Lincoln's years among us.<br />  If you have time to read only one of the Civil War books from that burgeoning genre, read this one.  You will come to know, from the inside out,  this prairie boy who became a towering figure in American history.	2002-08-23

It is also a paean to the rural South and to a vanished way of life. In the southern tradition of looking to the past, Bragg has reconstructed the short, difficult, meaningful life of Charlie Bundrum.  He must have relied heavily on the memories of his mother, Margaret, who was perhaps the neediest of Charlie's brood, and thus the closest to her father.<br />  Charlie was a man who was fiercely protective of his eight children, and a hard-working father who would do just about anything to provide for them.  He died at 51, worn out from long years of labor, and suffering from a liver ailment caused by decades of drinking moonshine.<br />  Having just reviewed \\"...and Ladies of the Club\\", this reviewer cannot help contrasting the southern culture Bragg describes with the midwestern, community-minded society of that book.  Few men of Charlie's era in that society died so young. The midwest is filled with long-lived descendants of the Germans and Scandinavians who first populated the area.  This is just one of the many north/south differences which will become apparent as you read Bragg's book.<br /><br />  Charlie was a proud, independent man, in the Jeffersonian tradition.  Family came first in his hardscrabble life, although he was charitable, taking in an outcast older man who lived with the family for many years. Bragg has done a wonderful job of fleshing out the grandfather he never knew. In \\"Ava's Man\\" you will find it easy to look beyond the southern stereotypes to find<br />the real man, Charlie Bundrum.  Highly recommended!	2002-08-22

I mean the truly old ones which refer to her \\"roadster\\" and her \\"chums\\" Bess and George, and the faithful housekeeper Hannah who always provided hot cocoa and comfort. In spite of an occasional unreconstructed, politically incorrect detail or two, these books are gems. Nancy's character was a wonderful role model for girls growing up in the 40s and 50s. Free and unfettered, supremely confident and clever, Nancy led her readers down a merry path of good times and entertaining adventures.<br /><br /> \\"The Haunted Bridge\\" is among the best of the series, although all of the earlier books are wonderfully written and capable of delighting young readers still. As for the later books, written by someone else to capitalize on the success of the tv show, I haven't read them so I can't offer opinions. I do know it would be hard to match the dozens of books beginning in the l930s.	2002-08-21

Set in Detroit, &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; is a satisfying read which will keep your interest throughout.  Kienzle is especially skilled at detailing his characters---cops, cops' wives, priests( and in this case, priest's wife!)<br />  Those familiar with Detroit will be pleased to recognize familiar streets, landmarks, stores, institutions. Kienzle paints an affectionate, even rather proprietary picture of his city.  Women will be pleased to find his generous yet accurate assessments of his female characters. His skill at writing about women's feelings and motives has grown in his career, and his more recent books are informed by good insights.  (He gives credit to his wife in the dedication of &quot;The Sacrifice.&quot;)<br />  This is an enjoyable book which will keep you guessing until the final pages.	2002-08-20

This epic tale of a small midwestern town found many eager readers.  I found it compelling, and Santmyer's account kept me turning the hundreds of pages, although I am unable to point to reasons.<br /><br /> As a former midwestern girl I could easily plug into the book, since the characters and setting felt so much like home.  The sincere goodness of many of the earnest characters reminded me of the people of my own town.  Their struggles, joys, redemptions earned and unearned, strike a familiar chord.<br /><br /> This is by any definition a woman's book.  Male readers looking for an action/adventure tale might be disappointed. But Santmyer is eloquent in her depiction of slow-paced, relationship-based lives. Highly recommended!	2002-08-20

His account will grip your interest from the first page.  His boyhood in rural Georgia will surprise some readers with its primitive living (no electricity in the early years), and its very hard work.  Carter's description of the complexity and self-suffiency of life on the farm is among the best I have read.<br /><br /> You will discover that his mother, who became the nation's &quot;Miz Lillian&quot;, was unconventional in ways beyond her fair-minded attitude toward blacks.  She insisted upon a life of her own and was independent in ways that were highly unusual for that place and time.  His father, Earl, was more conventional outwardly, observing what was then southern propriety, yet he also had enlightened attitudes toward blacks, as well as in other areas. Carter is frank in describing his family's history on both sides, which is full of eccentricity.<br />  You may react as I did--&quot;What a rich life!&quot;  As viewed through the eyes of the child Jimmy, who was very bright, sensitive, eager to please and hard-working, here is southern life depicted with its miserable aspects (disease, poor nutrition, snakes, bugs) and its great joys (Shetland riding ponies, hunting dogs, feasting at butchering time, socializing at Sunday school &quot;proms&quot;).  As detailed as a great novel, this book will enrich your life.<br />  Jimmy identifies the five people, other than his family, who had the most influence on his life.  Not surprising, only two are white. Rosalynn and Jimmy now make their home in Plains, where they enjoy life-long friendships with the people they never really left behind, throughout their successful lives and their rise to the highest pinnacle of power in this country.  Jimmy remains true to the values he learned as a youngster.  Highly recommended!	2002-08-20

Divided into chapters covering two decades each, his account mixes personal memoir with the story of his research.  He specialized in slime molds, although his interest roamed throughout all biological disciplines.<br /><br />  Young scientists reading Bonner's book will both smile and grimace.  His account of his reports fifty years ago to the NSF regarding his grant will surely produce both reactions at the same time:  &quot;Things have not worked out well.  I have tried this, that, and the other, and nothing has really worked.&quot;  The reply was, &quot;Don't worry about it---this is the way research goes sometimes.  Maybe next year you will have better luck.&quot;  My husband, a cloud physicist for over twenty-five years, is utterly astonished at such an exchange.<br />  Bonner writes clearly and sometimes jokily, in true scientific fashion, without much  color and brio to hold a reader's interest.  Nevertheless he has lived in a fascinating time, has seen the germination and flowering of many ideas that have revolutionized biology, and for this reason alone his book is worth reading.	2002-08-18

He writes in great detail of the journey of the French ship on its only slave trading voyage from the coast of Brittany to Martinique in the New World. Relying of the shipboard journals of Robert Durand, a young First Lieutenant, Harms gives us an account of the political, economic, and social worlds of the European empires, of the African societies, and the new plantations of the Americas.  We read brutal accounts of pirate ships, of crew mutinies, of slave uprisings aboard ships.<br />Profit was the motive, of course, and when the Diligent returned home to Vannes, a smallish French city with a rising merchant class, the ship owners, the Billy brothers, sued the captain, Pierre Mary, for cheating them on the profits of the voyage.  Bad luck, weather, illness, and mismanagement no doubt all played a role in the low profits of the first voyage.  The Diligent never made another slave-run into the West Indies.<br />Written in fairly dry, fairly academic prose, this book will not be a best-seller, but you will find it profitable reading of those harsh times and places not so distantly removed from our own.	2002-08-16

Her story of growing up in Africa is an unusual one, and would survive by being character-driven as well as landscape-driven, but due to her well-thought out metaphors and her honest portrayal through the eyes of the child and adolescent that she was, the story flourishes. Her book is despairing, encouraging, cynical, innocent, as varied and buzzing with life as its tropical setting.<br /><br /> It was a rough life, with tropical diseases and snakes and political upheaval.  Likes so many British colonials, her parents were heavy smokers, drinkers, and partiers.  Her father was ever-optimistic: If things didn't work out, they would move on.  Her mother, an animal lover, was good to the natives (she ran a weekly medical clinic out of her kitchen back door) but hotly resented the natives' victory over British rule when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.  Her mother bore five children but lost three to disease and accidents, and became mentally unstable for a time.<br /><br /> I notice from the back cover notes that Fuller now lives in Wyoming, which strikes me as fitting.  One could hardly expect someone with her hardscrabble, adventurous background to become a tame big-city dweller.	2002-08-16

This falls into the &quot;Only in America&quot; category.  There are inevitable detours along the way as he grows up amidst a family whose members are frequently at cross-purposes with each other.  His book has been described by an Entertainment Weekly reviewer as &quot;a son's gift to his mother&quot;, who is presented as near-saintly. (One does have the passing thought that a daughter might have written a memoir with different insights and a different tone.)<br />Bragg has become articulate in the great tradition of southern writers; his book is worth a reader's time.	2002-08-16

Born into an era of the 50s and early 60s when one wage-earner could support large families, they along with their three brothers and parents, constituted a ten-member family.  (It's interesting to note that among the eight siblings there are only, as of the present, eleven grandchildren. Times change.)<br />  The five sisters  cover much territory in their book , writing of the various stages of their lives, of men, of careers and of jobs that paid the rent, of motherhood, of adventure, of time management, of holidays and sisters' weeks.  You name the topic and you'll probably find it here.  The central theme of this high-spirited book is connectedness, the invigorating bonding all women need to flourish and to find meaning in their life and work.<br />  Whenever a friend has to move, amid the wrenching goodbyes I have learned to tell her, &quot;When you find just one good friend in the new area, it will begin to seem like home.&quot;  Sisters are especially lucky because they have lifelong friends in each other, and as the five Dolan sisters can testify, that connection survives years and distance and whatever events life brings.	2002-08-15

That said, it's handy to have all of Austen's exquisite writing in one volume.  This marvelously articulate woman wrote with with razor-sharp perception, and the emotional states of her characters are fully detailed and examined.  The reader will have to pay attention constantly while reading, or s/he will miss the richness of description, and maybe even some necessary subtle plot lines.  These novels are meant to be read slowly and carefully, and savoured.  Austen may be an acquired taste, but once you appreciate her, you will be hooked for life.  I rarely re-read anything, but her works stand up to re-reading.	2002-08-14

We now find her as a miserably unsure girl on the brink of adolescence. Searching for love yet unable to trust anyone, questioning the motives of others, she soon spells trouble for the adolescent males in her life.  A pretty, emotionally needy girl, she uses boys and lets them use her. She embarks upon a disastrous early marriage. Predictably, none of these relationships produce happiness.<br /><br />  Lauck  blindly slants everything her way, without recognizing the legitimate stories and motives and needs of other people. She also fails to realize that the teen years are not smooth sailing for anyone, as she compares her conflicted relationships with those of her friends, and envies them their intact and strong families. Readers who have raised adolescents will see through much of the bias of her descriptions of the aunt and uncle who adopted her, as well as her slanted descriptions of other family members.  \\"We did the best we could,\\" they try to tell her, but she has no ears to hear, and feels neglected and betrayed.<br /><br />  The suicide at age 23 of her brother, even though he has been distant from her for years, sends her further into a downward spiral.  She enters therapy and then sets on a quest to investigate what happened to him, ignoring her grandparents who gently told her, \\"You are looking for someone to blame.\\"  She goes down various paths in her search but seems to ignore the family history as her mother may have been mentally unstable, and there may be some genetic predisposition which affected her brother.  She dismisses this as some kind of hatred from her father's family toward her mother, instead of giving it any credence.<br /><br /> Readers will wish Jennifer Lauck well and will be happy for her in her marriage and in her son, but a sophisticated reader will look with dismay at her book, which often verges on the self-preoccupation of the narcissist.  Yes, there are reasons for this, but one hopes that all of us grow up at last, and hopes for her that she will stop making ogres of people, and will turn a clear eye on her own behavior, some of which is manipulative.<br /><br />There are some spelling errors in the book which got by the copy readers, and also Lauck has the annoying habit of using \\"me\\" as a subject pronoun; \\"Grandma and me were watching tv\\".  Since this occurs throughout the book, apparently  it is a conscious decision. To this reader, it is a telling one.

Don't look for the tragic story of her misguided marriage and the heartbreak and barrenness it brought her, or for descriptions of her love affair with adventurer Denys Finch-Hatton.  None of that appears here.<br /> Instead, &quot;Out of Africa&quot; is a storytelling book woven in the imaginative Danish style.  Dinesen's finely tuned sensitivity is revealed here, as well as her (again typically Danish) well-developed gift for friendship with many kinds of people.  In her case this gift extends to African animals as well, like Lulu, the beautiful gazelle who graced her plantation for years.<br /><br /> Her descriptions of the Kenya of her day are exquisitely written, factual and magical at the same time.  Africa is the star of the book, not Dinesen herself, not the tribespeople or the colonials, not her  struggles with raising coffee in land &quot;a little too high&quot;, nor her political dealings with the government officials. Her writing evokes the Africa she knew well and loved deeply.	2002-08-09

Her beautiful mother, doomed to die from cancer, forged a bond of love and intimacy and even at times, light-hearted fun, with little Jennifer. But the day to day, hour to hour care devolved upon the girl, as her father spent long days working and her brother insisted upon his freedom to be a boy. Reading the account of her early days, one notes first of all the striking role reversal of the small child caring for the mother's needs both physical and emotional. Few children would be able to cope as well as Jennifer did.<br /><br /> After her mother's death, her father moved the family in with his girlfriend, and before much time elapsed, her father died also. Jennifer and her brother were left to the devices of the not-quite-sane Deb and her toxic form of New Age/fundamentalist religion. Through many trials, they proved to be survivors, and Jennifer tells her tale in the voice of a resilient, strong woman, not given to self-pity, and remarkably, emotionally healthy in spite of her \\"off the margins\\" life.<br />Her account will dismay, enlighten, and uplift you, all at the same time.	2002-08-09

Harrison is a gifted writer who brings all her skills to bear upon this account of her father's betrayal of ancient taboos, and  total disregard of damage inflicted.<br />  Writing &quot;The Kiss&quot; was no doubt a mega-catharsis for Harrison.  Why she published it, remains an open question.  The best guess is she wanted revenge upon her father.  Yet it seems to this reviewer that such soulbaring in making her story public could be damaging to her, as well, in that it is rather like a constant re-opening of wounds.  Air and light will heal wounds, but a constant draft and a too harsh sun will prevent healing.	2002-08-09

The second, a longlasting union with a psychoanalyst who helped her raise their blended family of five daughters---two his, one hers, and two theirs--has given her optimism and faith in the institution of marriage.<br /><br />She worries for some of her daughters, as yet unmarried, and ponders whether arranged marriages---the norm in many places over many centuries---work out better than \\"romantic\\" ones.  She roams over many topics, including the introduction of children into the marriage, the influence of in-laws, the differing gender-natures of male and female, the recurring patterns of relationships in families.<br /><br /> I enjoyed the book for Roiphe's witty, elegant yet clear-as-water prose, although I didn't agree with all of her statements and/or conclusions.  Since she wrote in far less than didactic style, I don't think she'll mind.

Their true love came through clearly to me and reminded me of my own parents' and my close aunt and uncle's relationships.

He gives lyricists equal time also, and his discussion of Hammerstein's simple, moving &quot;Ol' Man River&quot; (along with possible sources of<br />inspiration for it) is especially well done.<br />This book would be a splendid addition to anyone interested in American popular songs in the pre-rap, pre-screaming days, when a flowing, &quot;whistlable&quot; melody was king.	2002-07-29

He presents us with a lightweight yet winning book, although at times I felt I had strayed into the script of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; as he details Lucy's isolation, her days spent playing backgammon inside her shuttered Beverly Hills home, with her outdated 50's decor and kitchen appliances.<br />  He doesn't make the Lucy he knew into a saintly figure; instead he lets us in on her &quot;star-ego&quot; moments and her lapses into pettiness.  He describes in detail how each of her homes and her ski condo at Snowmass, Colorado are decorated, and tells us of her wardrobe with her extensive collection of fur coats.<br />  Although his book is entertaining, with some degree of unavoidable name-dropping, I think most people prefer to remember Lucy as she was in the 50s when her antics made a whole nation laugh with delight.	2002-07-29

Nancy Milford had unparalleled access to the correspondence of Millay, and interviews with her surviving sister, Norma.  Milford wrote the book over a period of years, allowing her study of Millay some time for seasoning and reflection.<br />  The early slangy, insouciant letters between the poet and her mother and sisters, are a delight, revealing their loving, teasing relationships. (I admit to being surprised by their wide use of baby talk.) Since Millay moved in literary circles and knew many writers, the letters back and forth to lovers and friends are wonderfully expressive. Many female readers may wish that their husbands and boyfriends could write of love and longing as eloquently!<br /><br />  Milford reveals how Millay labored over her art, how creating her lyrics which seem to flow smoothly and effortlessly, required energy and commitment on her part to produce.<br /><br /> She details Millay's slide into alcoholism and drug dependence in her later years.  One wonders how intelligent, educated people like Millay and her husband Eugene could fall into such a state, but apparently there was no one in their lives to do what today is trendily called \\"an intervention,\\" and as they became more and more isolated, Millay's physical decline was accelerated.<br /><br />  Kudoes to Nancy Milford for a comprehensive biography of a passionate American poet!	2002-07-25

Although the book could be frightening, it will certainly appeal to younger readers. In true fantasy style, anything can happen, any character can appear/disappear, and surprises lurk everywhere.  As a reader not particularly fond of this sci-fi fantasy mode, I was not enthralled by \\"Coraline\\", but I cannot fault Gaiman's  ability as an exceptionally good writer.	2002-07-23

The mac and cheese recipe, an excellent comfort food, is the easiest, most delicious one I have found in years.  Unlike some of the recipes which appear in the monthly magazine, these offerings are not labor- and time-intensive; yet they are satisfying to make and to eat.

In the midst of the horrors of Terezin, surrounded by suffering, deprivation, and death, hungry women recorded recipes of warmth, comfort, and abundance.  They remembered cooking delicious meals, serving delicacies and caviar, making aspic, cooking many varieties of dumplings.  The hand-written cookbook they put together demonstrates that although the Nazis held their bodies captive, their spirits remained free, drawing strength and nourishment from their memories of happy days and fully-laden tables. Despite the wretched conditions of the camp, these women dared to hope for a time when they could return to their kitchens and once again rejoice in feeding their families.<br />  This haunting book will bless your life.	2002-06-29

Shaw has given us a gripping account of the steamship Arctic, which sank in September 1854 while making a crossing from Liverpool.  The book is informed by his wide knowledge as a seaman, and his grasp of the economic competition between U.S. ship company owner Collins and his British rival, Cunard.  The steamship was traveling as quickly as its boilers could take it, even in inpenetrable fog, when it collided with a smaller vessel, the French steamship, Vesta.<br />  Ironically at first, it looked as it the Vesta was fatally damaged, and Captain Luce of the Arctic had to make one of the toughest decisions a mariner must face:  He had to try to save his own passengers and crew and leave the people on the Vesta to their fates.  But it soon became apparent that the Arctic was sinking quickly, without nearly enough lifeboats for all the people on board. In the chaos that followed, all the women and children passengers were lost.  Only the strongest and most agile survived, most of them crew members. As for the Vesta, although many suffered loss of life, the ship was able to limp into Newfoundland days later.<br />  Shaw writes well, although occasionally his foreshadowing is heavily overdone.  This can be partially excused, since we know the tragic outcome of the tale, but it gives his work an amateurish quality.  Overall, this harrowingly sad sea yarn will hold your attention throughout.	2002-06-28

It amazes me that otherwise educated and articulate scholars and professors, like Rosemary Sullivan, are woefully ignorant of research in sociobiology into the nature of gender. Not only is Sullivan unaware of these studies, but she also seems to either dismiss, or lack knowledge of, the folk wisdom of centuries. She writes well of what she calls the \\"obsessive\\" romantic love that women seek, and of their anguish, grief and loss when this love ends. She writes of gifted, strong women who subjugate their own talents and careers to those of men.<br /> She does not factor into her analysis the fact that women, as mammalian creatures, are hardwired physiologically and hormonally for connectedness. Yes, we are more than mere animals, but a good starting point in searching for reasons for women's behavior is to look at our physical makeup. Without women's need to be connected to a man, to bear and to nurture children, to cherish family and community ties, our species would soon become extinct.<br />At the emotional core of a woman is not just \\"obsessive\\" love for a man, not just romantic passion for physical lovemaking, but also the fierce, unending, protecting and nurturing love of a mother for her children.<br /> Women soon learn that they need the structures of society, especially those pertaining to marriage and the family, to sustain their search for personal fulfillment. Wise women (including those who have had to learn the hard way) know that they trespass outside these structures at their own peril.<br /> Yes, romantic love is wonderful, and falling in love is an unforgettable, defining experience; but especially for women, that experience is only the prelude to a rich and satisfying life.	2002-06-27

I cherish it, with all its notes on the margins and additional recipe clippings stuck inside. As one who grew up on the less-than-gourmet fare of the 50s, like Chef Boyardee and jello with marshmallows, I was eager to put together wholesome and delicious family meals.  Even after so many thousands of meals have turned into piles of dirty dishes, I still bring enthusiasm to daily chef duty, and I have found new joy in this updated version of the absolute classic.<br />  The book features many healthier, leaner, and more cosmopolitan recipes.  I frequent Trader Joe's and love to bring home new finds.  American cuisine has expanded to incorporate good food from many countries, and you will find excellent Asian and Hispanic recipes in the new book.

Harold Gullan's well-researched provides us with an entertaining look at the First Mothers.  He has grouped them not in straight chronological fashion but instead by categories such as &quot;Maternal Ambition&quot; and &quot;Continuity and Change.&quot;<br />The mothers since around 1900 are more fully fleshed out, since more material is available about them than about the women of previous times, with the exception of Abigail Adams.  The wide correspondence of John Q. Adams' mother provides us with a detailed picture of her life and times.<br />  Whether they were hard-working, hands-on moms like Hannah Nixon on the West Coast, or wealthy like Rose Kennedy and Sarah Roosevelt on the East Coast who employed nannies to change diapers, all the First Mothers loved and supported their sons, influenced and inspired them.  Some adhered to the values of the Puritan faith of early America, and its characteristics of simple living, cheerfulness, and service.  Others, like two southerners,  Virginia Kelley and Lillian Carter, were free spirited individuals.

Through her description of hundreds of items considered vitally necessary to the household, she ponders the cast-in-stone class structure, the assumptions which underlay the roles and behavior of men and women, the status of children, the notions of childcare, the sturdy outdoor motif of country living.  The weather, she said, was simply ignored, and people went about what they meant to do, rain or sun.  Hunting and gardening figured prominently; many social activities centered around<br />these activities.<br />  Americans who know the work of writers like Agatha Christie will be familiar with this English world, dissimilar from our own country especially because of rigid class distinctions.  A middle class household, Lively tells us, would be expected to employ servants.  Her grandmother could spend hour upon hour doing rigorous physical labor in her gardens, but she felt much put upon when in later days, she was faced with doing her own &quot;washing up&quot; (kitchen dishes and pans). Lively also describes well the distance between genders, the attitude that men and women were utterly different, with different interests and orientations, unlike the more intimate, nose-to-nose marriages that began around mid-century.<br /><br /> Lively's essay is composed of personal perceptions, and although I find the limitations of this subjectivity its one drawback, I  recommend it as an entertaining view to a vanished era.	2002-06-04

Joshua Muravchik will please his far-right-wing colleagues with the thoughts expressed in his book, \\"Heaven on Earth,\\" but plenty of more moderate readers and deep thinkers will struggle to find his book worthwhile reading.<br /><br /> He does a competent job of providing us with capsule biographies of well-known socialist luminaries-- Engels, Marx, Samuel Gompers and others. He also includes utopian-community leaders like Owens, and present-day world leaders like British P.M.Blair. Muravchik lists as his first socialist a French idealist of 200 years ago. The idea of economic parity, equal distribution of wealth, has been around much longer than that. Christians know that the early disciples \\"held all goods in common\\" as described in the book of Acts. Jesus said, \\"If you have two cloaks and your brother has none, give him one of yours.\\" If Muravchik is going to include people like Blair in his review of socialists, certainly Jesus qualifies also, along with his first century followers.<br /><br /> It astounds and offends me that Muravchik ignores the flourishing \\"cradle-to-grave\\" social-democratic states of Scandinavia, where poverty does not exist, where literacy is universal, where crime rates are miniscule compared to capitalist states.  His  badly-researched book lacks credibility since he fails to discuss the social democratic countries of northern Europe. My grandfather's native Denmark leads the entire world in the portion of its budget allotted to humanitarian causes, and Danish Relief Services is a compassionate and constant presence in Third World countries. Is Muravchik ignorant of the stellar success of socialist ideas in Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries, or does he willfully avoid any mention of them since any discussion of firmly-rooted Marxism would undermine his book subtitle, \\"rise and fall of socialism\\". Socialism has not fallen in Denmark, or in Sweden and Norway! And in this era of global capitalism, greed and environmental exploitation, its light shines even brighter.shines even brighter.	2002-05-24

In this masterful memoir she writes of her soaring highs and despairing lows eloquently, never running out of words to describe the two extreme states.  Holder of a PhD in psychology from UCLA, she candidly admits that lithium is vitally necessary to manage her mental health, but also she believes that therapy will help a great deal toward resolving the many breakages---career path, friendships, love affairs--that manic depression can leave in its wake. She is generous in her praise and thanks to all who have helped her through the years, from colleague-therapists, to her lovers, to her mother, brother, and his children.<br />  As I read this book, I had questions about various topics: How common is this disorder and through how many generations can we currently trace it?  What was done in the past to treat it? How does one &quot;regulate&quot; the dosage of lithium so life is not just shades of grey forever?  How strong is the hereditary component?  How did Jamison, who is childless, feel about having children?  The author has thought through her presentation so well that by the time I finished, all my queries had been addressed.<br />Jamison is awe of current biotech studies, which depict in vivid color photos the state of the brain, from excited and &quot;high&quot; moods to depressed and &quot;low&quot;.  But is life more than mere chemical reactions?  Jamison's heroic determination to claim her life and to relish it in spite of manic-depressive illness gives us a resounding &quot;yes!&quot;	2002-05-14

This spring, the A and E cable network produced &quot;Shackleton&quot;, a cold-country-frontier saga.  In this tradition, Clive Powell-Williams has written &quot;Cold Burial.&quot;<br /> This book is an engrossing page-turner and a quick read.  You will be caught up in the tale of 18 year old Edgar Christian and his mother's double-cousin, Jack Hornby, an experienced Canadian-Northwest Territories outdoorsman.  Experienced he may be, but seasoned he is not.  Impulsive, improvident, and arrogant to boot, he takes his cousin on what will be their first and final adventure together.  Having relied heavily upon luck and upon the help of natives, Jack finds his luck has run out.  He does try to spare his young cousin, but events proceed inevitably<br />to a tragic end.  Powell-Williams relies  upon the diaries of  young Edgar to put together a chilling story of their days in a climate hostile to human life.  Female readers may be tempted to ask, &quot;Why would they want to do that?&quot;  The only answer is the famous one, &quot;Because it's there!&quot;  Apparently that insouciant reply makes sense to males; but to a mother, it rings hollow.	2002-05-10

Joe Kennedy, clan patriarch, was well acquainted with image-making and public relations. Unlike previous political administrations, the Kennedy presidency was a well-orchestrated exercise in this questionable enterprise.<br /><br /> Barbara Leaming has relied on Jackie Kennedy's extensive correspondence with former British P.M. Harold MacMillan to gain new material on the well-covered tale of Jackie's White House years.  A sad picture emerges, of a lonely woman without even one intimate friend, and without the spiritual resources that consoled her mother-in-law Rose.  Forced to endure the deaths of two newborns as well as several miscarriages, she had to deal with her husband's pathological sexual infidelities and the lack of privacy her role as First Lady entailed. She tried to fill her empty heart and empty days with trivial activities like constant interior decorating and re-decorating, and shopping for outrageously expensive wardrobes.  Does this sound like a rosy life in Camelot, the dream world where all is smiling perfection? A deeper question after forty years is, why do we continue to purchase books about these people?	2002-04-26

It may seem startling to read of her early childhood in the l950s without indoor plumbing or electricity.  She writes lyrically of the beauties, and plainly of the hardships, of Montana spring days and winter nights.  The people adapt by becoming extremely practical, and pride themselves on their toughness.  Despite the long distances between ranch houses, community bonding is strong.  One of the most moving passages in her book is the story of taking her toddler daughter, who is suffering a high fever and convulsions, on the long, muddy and uncertain journey to the nearest hospital.  Along the way, neighbors drive out their ranch roads to the main road, blinking their headlights as a sign of solidarity, good wishes, and support.<br /><br /> Judy, although a good and uncomplaining worker, seems unfit for ranch life, as she is imaginative to the point of being eccentric. (Or, maybe not: As a longtime resident of the intermountain west, I know there is room here for all kinds of people.)  A couple of episodes in the book involve self-mutilation, and are meant to convey her anger over being denied full ranch-citizenship because she is female.  But to this<br />reviewer, these self-dramatizing descriptions ring rather false.<br />  Her parents' love and time must be devoted to unremitting ranch chores, and there is little left over for five children, or so Judy felt.  She doesn't get the attention she would like, although her parents respond strongly to her adolescent behavior.  At eighteen, she is perceived by parents and community as old enough to become a ranch wife.  It was my judgment from reading of her attitude and actions that she was a very young 18, inwardly immature even if outwardly competent.  She struggles with her role as a ranch wife, unable to own anything in her own name although expected to pull her share.  She knows that in reality women pull more than their share, expected to help when necessary with seasonal ranch chores, while men are not expected to help with the household chores at any time.  She ponders the rising tide of 70s women's liberation, aware of her grandmothers' generation who struggled for gentility, hiding their work-coarsened hands in white gloves, drinking tea and addressing each other formally, in their own mode of \\"consciousness-raising.\\"  Wise in ways that urban sophisticates are not, she sees ironies and shades of grey.<br />  There are many wonderful memoirs of American life on the Lower East Side, in Los Angeles, in the pre- and post-bellum South, and in the midwestern heartland.

Although I have read several other accounts of Alexandra's life, I enjoyed this one for its understanding and sympathetic presentation of this intelligent, sensitive woman, who was most of all a loving and dutiful wife and mother.  Erickson makes it clear that although she lived amidst the astounding opulence of the Russian court, both she and Tsar Nicholas had fairly simple tastes, and their lives were defined by their lasting love for each other.<br />  For Americans, who are born into a culture of opportunity and democracy, it is a stretch to comprehend the strains, as well as the privileges, of the old European aristocracy.  Alix was under severe pressure to bear a son.  When she did, the life-threatening illness of her son was a private heartbreak and ongoing crisis that had to be kept secret.<br />  The cataclysmic, extremely  bloody clash between feudal, imperial Russia and the political ideas of the industrialized West ended the lives of many thousands.  Sadly, the Tsarina, her well-loved Nicky, and her much cherished four daughters and son were among them.	2002-04-23

Ramsland includes a section of &quot;orbs&quot; photographs taken with a digital camera, and in several places quotes camera manufacturers who say they have no explanation for the pictures.  Anyone who uses a dig cam (and without making an accusation, I remind readers of Adobe Photo Shop) knows that aberrations of light do occur at times.<br />  In short, although the topic remains fascinating, Ramsland's treatment is woefully short of originality.	2002-04-23

This is par for the course in this genre, and puts this reviewer in mind of Charlie Brown's standard beginning for tales, \\"It was a dark and stormy night.\\"<br /><br /> Despite its rather disorganized and somewhat repetitive presentation (again, fairly standard for this genre), Keel relates his narrative earnestly, and he will engage your interest.  Men in Black?  Saucer shaped vehicles with diamond-shaped windows?  \\"Thyroid-like eyes\\"? If this gets your attention, you'll enjoy \\"The Mothman Prophecies.\\"<br /><br />  The recent movie is based only loosely on Keel's research, by the way, and will fail to satisfy  informed ufology readers.	2002-04-18

A happy childhood she had not, and she was nearly doomed to &quot;a lifetime of...impotent makebelieve&quot; as a housewife,by an early pregnancy and marriage. Her intelligence and determination to avoid this fate was supplemented from unlikely sources, some of her 60ish spinster teachers.  One of them said, &quot;..at the top of her voice that seventeen was the ideal age to have a healthy baby and get on with your life.&quot;<br /><br />  Her mother also helped, by taking care of her daughter while she and her equally young husband attended university and became the first married couple of ordinary student age to graduate in the same subject at the same time, both with Firsts.<br />  Sage's engrossing story is jarring to readers like me, who enjoyed wonderful childhood days.  It also will be jarring to childless professional women who today face a different set of conventions, and difficulties combining motherhood and career.	2002-04-15

Published in 1938 and re-issued in library binding in 1981, it will entrance readers of this generation who are fortunate enough to encounter the book.<br /><br />Based on the life of Field's great-aunt, Henriette Field, the story will carry the reader along effortlessly. Field's superb description of the inner life and thoughts of Henriette feels authentic; we come to know her very well.  We also become well acquainted with the people surrounding her in the household of the French duke where she serves as governess.<br /><br /> Henriette's fate was inextricably linked with a tragic crime which became as well known in her day as the Simpson case in ours. Her later life, in the United States, brought her an extremely happy marriage and a fulfilling intellectual life.  She mingled with many of the influential thinkers and political activists of her day.<br /><br />  Field's depiction of the American days does not come alive quite as much as the first part of the book, Henriette's life as a governess. Despite this unevenness, the novel is a work by a master author who is a match for Daphne Du Maurier any day.  Highly recommended, richly satisfying!	2002-04-14

Today the disease is much more easily treated than when Bobby was born, in 1956.<br />  The Massies describe their struggle to do the best they could and to ensure that Bobby would have the most normal life experiences possible.  They describe their encounters with<br />doctors and nurses, some warm and nurturing, others coldly uncaring and clinical.  In the book, Bobby himself writes of  his own journey, with hundreds upon hundreds of necessary transfusions, and with many periods of enforced idleness so hard<br />on a young boy.<br /><br />  In one of what is the most meaningful passages for me, Suzanne describes how distant she felt from other young mothers of her circle as they chatted about daily small matters, about the PTA and their children's sports teams.  Suzanne's life had been unutterably altered not by a crisis event, but by an ongoing momentous struggle.  As the mother of an adult autistic son, I fully understand her feelings.<br /><br />  This is marvelous book about love, family, grit, and the triumph of the human spirit.	2002-04-07

It is &quot;patently&quot; a well-crafted tale, to use Blackie's other favorite adverb.  I was truly surprised when he found the solution to another closed-room mystery, his specialty.  This is a gentler, kinder book than many of his earlier offerings.  Blackie has softened over the years, and has a detached and fuller understanding of the passions of youth.<br />  Set in Paris, and poking fun at many typically French characters and attitudes, Greeley's book will make you smile and keep you wondering until the last pages.	2002-04-03

(If the movie of the same name is based upon Mc Crumb's book, it is so VERY loosely based as to be unrecognizable.)<br /><br />  The old songs, many of which are sung in medieval, hauntingly lovely Dorian modes, are unfamiliar to the modern ear since the chord structures and intervals are different from those used today. They tell of love and longing, fate and struggle, heartbreak and fulfillment.  (Perhaps in a future edition of the book, cds can be included so the reader can hear the songs McCrumb carefully describes?)<br /><br />  In &quot;The Songcatcher,&quot; McCrumb is able to subtly invoke the spirit of Celtic mysticism which enlivens all her novels.  Highly recommended.	2002-04-03

I've read all of her works, and I eagerly look forward to more.<br /><br /> She treats all of her characters, police detectice Thanet and those he must investigate, with a careful compassion and a gentle probing into motives and actions.  Her novels are not psychological studies; instead they are journeys into wisdom as we learn to understand the hearts of all the characters, Thanet and his family included.

Caroline Gutmann puts together an account of the life, work, and relationships of Lamaze through the use of family letters and papers.  She uncovers the reasons why he sought to make childbirth less painful.  Gutmann resists the temptation to sugarcoat Lamaze's weaknesses and failings, like keeping several mistresses despite his fairly happy marriage.<br />  In l951 Lamaze traveled to Russia, where Soviet doctors proudly showed him their method of \\"psychoprophylactic\\" childbirth.  He was impressed (although in the light of history, one has to wonder just how successful their methods were, as so much of Soviet science has since been discounted).  Lamaze refined their technique and began teaching his preparation exercises to women in their last three months of pregnancy.  On a personal note:  I have experienced Lamaze births for three of my four children.  I smile to note that what we were taught to call only \\"contractions\\", never \\"pains,\\" are now referred to as \\"pains\\" by Lamaze trainers.  Apparently during labor many women exclaimed, \\"Contraction?  What do you mean?  That was a PAIN!\\"  My experiences were not painless, but I am thankful to Lamaze for his legacy of educating women about what happens during childbirth, and about safeguarding the health of their newborn by not using pharmaceutical painkillers during birth.<br />  Gutmann writes in Gallic style, which may seem somewhat emotionally exaggerated and offputting to American readers, but her biography is a valuable contribution to the memory of a man who changed the way childbirth is accomplished for generations of women.	2002-04-02

In the lengthy and wide-reaching memoir we meet Barbara and scores of other people who were significant in her eventful life.<br /><br />  Despite her privileged background, Barbara Bush is an ordinary woman with extraordinary qualities of wisdom and compassion.  Both she and her husband were raised in the old New England tradition to make their lives useful and to do good. Throughout these pages, Barbara's dedication to these Puritan ideals shines through.<br /><br />She is never pompous or ostentatious.  You feel that you could sit next to her on a three hour flight and talk companionably with her, and depart from her with your mood lifted.  This memoir is the gracefully written account of the life of a gracious lady.	2002-03-30

The movie fails to satisfy in the way &quot;Unsinkable&quot; will, as Butler provides us with a richly complete story of a tragedy that still grips the imagination.  Walter Lord's  &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; set the standard for non-fiction Titanic accounts; Butler refreshes the tale and provides us with even more details, and more information about the role of the Californian.<br /><br />  Since 9-11 it has been fashionable to say that &quot;the world is changed forever.&quot;  The sinking of the Titanic also signified the end of an era, not just Edwardian times but the end of the rigidly stratified class structure with its built-in inequities.  Also, the hubris of technology suffered a blow; we were never so innocent again as to place our belief in &quot;unsinkable&quot; ships, or the infallibility of any work of man.<br /><br />  The human story, and the failure of the &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; ship building, are both skillfully depicted in &quot;Unsinkable&quot;.  Kudoes to the author.  This book deserves a wide audience.	2002-03-26

(Love does not cure schizophrenia, but time does.) Sylvia Nasser is to be commended for her evenhanded, compassionate treatment of a complex man and his complex body of work. Although her detailed descriptions of his mathematical endeavors may prove to be heavy going, she also brings Nash to life in his glory as an innovative thinker, and in his ordeal as a victim of mental illness. A caveat to keep in mind: Not every genius is schizophrenic, and not every schizophrenic person is brilliant.

Habegger fleshes out well the cast of characters in her self-limited sphere, so that we feel we know well her family members and friends of that Victorian era so different from our own. The poet herself remains somewhat elusive, but I thank Habegger for refusing to reduce her to psychological cliches. His book is refreshingly free of five-cent analyses, however tempting Dickinson's character might be for such dismissive summaries.<br /><br /> There is no doubt that Dickinson ranks as one of the greatest American poets, due to her concise, spare, whimsical, and cerebral approach. Personally, I have never warmed to her poetry as I sense something lacking. She elevates feeling above all, as do all the poets of the romantic period. Unlike her Puritan ancestors, for whom the greatest love was the love of God, her energies and attachments all flow both from, and toward, her own feelings. Like a moonstruck adolescent, she prefers her dreams of love to the actual presence of the loved one. From her decision to withdraw from the necessary order and balance of the outside world, comes this outpouring of intense feeling expressed in the large body of her work.<br /> As a Lay Carmelite whose spiritual life has also been informed by Puritan ancestors, I praise the beauty of Dickinson's poems, but I cannot deny what seems to me their essential, self-referring shallowness. I know many will disagree with me and I do not disallow her position in the American canon.	2002-03-23

All the books are whimsical, engaging, and satisfying.  \\"Death of a Dustman\\", easily read in an evening, is no exception.  M.C.

You can read her books in the heat of a desert summer, as I have done, and still take pleasure in their \\"cozy\\" genre, and maybe even mentally hear the rain bleating against your windows. Hamish is a likeable character, easy-going and blessed with an understanding and insight of his Highland people which his superior officers, from the city of Inverness, often lack.

He urges that she be restored to the \\"canon\\",although her work has not been  lauded in recent years.<br />  The intense, highly emotional poet comes alive in the pages of his well-researched book.  She comes to us as a rebel, determined to live on her own terms, to make love with the freedom of a man,to explore the ecstatic heights of feeling. (Shelley, the author tells us, was her idol.)<br />  A central point that I feel Epstein misses is that, although she may have escaped the feminine role dictated by conventions of her time, she did not escape her own compulsion to make the search for love the driving force of her actions.  Her poetry also has as its overriding theme, romantic and sexual love. For this reason she missed achieving stature as a great poet. Even though she possessed a great facility for language, her works are too limited in scope.<br />  Her eventual descent into alcoholism and drug addiction can serve as a cautionary tale against the wild self-indulgence and perpetual adolescence that plagued Millay. It must be said, however, that her verbal gifts were so great that even in the midst of her addled despair in later life, she was able still to produce, although the work then was of lesser quality.<br />  Kudoes for Epstein's carefully researched, comprehensive biography.	2002-03-19

The account is  liberally sprinkled with quotations from her father's letters to her mother when they were separated, she safe in Hong Kong with three very young daughters, he at the mission.  Duffy's tone is never preachy or overly pious, but the essential goodness of her parents, dedicated to a life of service, shines through strongly.  So does their love for one another.  Duffy's book is an antidote to despairing thoughts about our world, which has always been troubled, but where people like her parents look beyond themselves to exercise faith, hope, and charity toward all.	2002-03-17

He also unblinkingly chronicles his own descent into drink as a young man, and the trail of broken relationships he left behind. At the close of the book, we are cheering for both Andrew and his father, &quot;Dr. Runner&quot; George, as they find peace and a measure of happiness with each other.<br />  Both men are seekers; for a large part of his life, George combed through the works of the philosophers, and left and later returned to, the Catholic faith of his youth.  As one of 12 children (what a brood, even for the post-WW II era!),George seeks love and attention which he felt lacking in his childhood,<br />as he was crowded in the late-middle of the group of children.<br />  &quot;The unexamined life is not worth living,&quot; one of the Greeks<br />tells us, and both men tend to examine their lives in great detail.  Indeed, they both stop just short of navel gazing, an activity to which this reviewer is opposed.  Too much examining can block one from living, I would put forward as a corollary to the philosopher.<br />  That said, this worthwhile book is an addition to the literature of father-son conflicts.

For example, the tragic scope of the Titanic sinking is never depicted richly enough in fiction or movies, where we follow the stories of a few when there are as many stories as there are people involved.<br />I will make an exception for this World War II story.  &quot;Sea of Glory&quot; is well-crafted and easy to read, and will probably find a wide audience as books about WWII are popular these days.  My only criticism is that the authors get a little syrupy in depicting the relationship among the four chaplains, which rings a little too good to be true. Surely they had some differences now and then, as we all do.....Nevertheless,  all four men were heroes, without a doubt, and their inspirational story deserves to be heard.	2002-03-08

I also feel her shining, transcedent spirit nearby as I read. Martha's diary is filled with the cycle of neverending chores that still characterize the lives of women today. As caretakers, we cook, launder, clean, over and over again. Martha's diary also opens our eyes to the lot of our earlier sisters as they lived through (if fortunate, they lived) an 18-month to two year cycle of pregnancy, birth, and lactation.<br /><br />Martha ministers to them both in body and spirit; and the entire, closely bonded community of post-colonial wives and mothers is depicted in her story.<br /><br />\\"I returned home at 10 hour morn, find my house alone and everything in Arms.

Ulrich has included statistics of maternal and infant mortality that cause one to question the wisdom of  the \\"heroic intervention\\"  style of obstetrics that came later:  Martha experienced only about a 4% loss rate, which stands up impressively  until the days when antibiotics reduced the mortality rate to insignificance.	2002-02-21

The victim herself, after watching Rule's &quot;Dead by Sunset&quot; as a tv  miniseries, remarked to her sister, &quot;If I am ever found dead, get Ann Rule to write my story.&quot;  Her sister did, and Rule has once more spoken eloquently for the victim.<br />  Brew the coffee, turn up the lamp, and settle in.

A philosophy professor who has taught at Notre Dame for forty years, he is a noted scholar whose novels reflect his knowledge of the vagaries and virtues of the human heart. In &quot;Triple Pursuit&quot; we are again in Fox River with Father Dowling, his staunch housekeeper, Marie Murkin, and his pal Detective Phil Keegan.  This is a marvelous yarn whose theme might be &quot;cherchez la femme.&quot;  Once again McInerny treats us to the interior lives of characters large and small, like the pretty young mother, Jane, who looks forward to private morning time after her husband is off to work and her children to school; or to the aging priest who continues to serve a parish despite nearly crippling arthritis.  McInerny is a mature fiction writer who writes equally well of women and men, something that cannot be said for a lot of younger male writers.  Kudos to him for this latest novel, and may he give us many more to enjoy!	2002-01-14

Estelle &quot; Woody&quot; Woodhaven, who investigates the murder of an English professor. Filled with literary allusions from as varied figures as Tennyson and Christie, the pace of this novel is slow enough to be comfortable, yet gripping enough to carry the reader along. For those readers unfamiliar with academia, it will be informative as well, revealing not only the petty, small-minded rivalries among faculty colleagues, but also the disturbing trend of colleges churning out too many PhDs for the existing job market. (In scientific disciplines this has been the case for decades.)<br />We hear the inner narrative of Woody Woodhaven throughout, as she relies on her common sense, her intuitive skills and the techniques of interviewing she has developed. With the help of Amanda Cross's previously featured English professor, Kate Fansler, Woody is able to unravel the mystery.<br />Although Cross's attitudes toward family life, marriage and children will be unfathomable to many (as in her previous novels), both Kate and Woody escape the label &quot;selfish&quot;---if only just barely. Amanda Cross is the mystery-writer penname of Carolyn Heilbrun, a member of the early generation of modern feminists, who (perhaps understandably) overreacted against traditional female roles. In the quest for gender equality they tended to ignore their own physiology and hormonal make-up, which are geared for connectedness and for maternity. Even in the l970s few women advocated this radical stance. Modern day young women try to incorporate family life with the need for autonomy and self-espression. Despite her off-pitch attitude, Cross's novels are elegant, literate, and amusing.	2002-01-14

Without meaning to, perhaps she has captured a significant difference between life in the U.S. and the old European culture. Here, if one does not practice Catholicism, often one is not labeled a Catholic. In addition to the tale of her parents' struggles, some puzzling tales of her own American life emerge: How could she go through religious instruction, and specifically the preparation for First Communion, and not question her parents' attitude, that communion is not an important part of the mass? Any child who is preparing for First Communion will be able to tell you that communion is the heart of the mass....Perhaps this reinforces an underlying theme of her book: She has been held captive in the tight knot of her family's past, and only by finding the truth of the events that shaped her parents' life, can she become free to be herself.	2001-11-30

Barber takes pains to emphasize that he is not against capitalism, which he feels has its virtues; he is only against its vices which are unbridled in the world marketplace. In reading the book one feels that he &quot;protests too much&quot;, as he acknowledges that capitalism now creates needs, rather than responding to legitimate needs, and turns citizens into consumers. He also points out that, while pretending to offer consumers more choices, it is the capitalist marketing that offers and limits the choices. In the US, one can choose which automobile to purchase; but to choose not to purchase an automobile is unrealistic for most people. Barber goes so far as to say that &quot;consumer choices&quot; really just amount to choosing which topping to have on that fast-food baked potato...Global marketing is not loyal to any creed, is not committed to any nation, does not addres the spiritual nature of its &quot;consumers.&quot;  Its sole aim is profit.  World capitalism in the form of &quot;infotainment&quot; has spread American culture throughout the globe, often against the will of people in European countries like France, as well as in Islamic lands, and in communist China.  This &quot;infotainment&quot; is often base, lowest-common-denominator stuff, which offends religous people of any creed. Third World people, including children, labor for 12 and 15 hour days for pennies an hour, producing clothing and household goods for the American market, as the megacorporations &quot;farm out&quot; their factory work, always looking at the bottom line: High profit and low expenditures....<br /> Barber is optimistic that we can combat the vices of world capitalism and once more become citizens, by investing our time and effort in civic organizations, like schools, voluntary associations, churches and synagogues. He acknowledges that the people of Third World countries, and also the nations of the former USSR, must be patient, as democracies take time to build,and cannot be imposed by some fiat by some &quot;nation-building&quot; American president, or by the UN....My husband and I, somewhat insulated from consumer mentality by the groves of academia, are longtime community volunteers.  Both of us have found this involvement to be satisfyingly worthwhile.  Years pass for us without one visit to the mall. Decades of tv sitcoms have come and gone without my viewing even a single episode.  We try to be &quot;nonstarters&quot; in the consumer frenzy, and although I am not as optimistic as Barber in his enthusiam that consumerism can turn back into citizenship, I do highly recommend his book.ousehold goods for the American market, as the megacorporations &quot;farm out&quot; their factory work, always looking at the bottom line: High profit and low expenditures....<BR> Barber is optimistic that we can combat the vices of world capitalism and once more become citizens, by investing our time and effort in civic organizations, like schools, voluntary associations, churches and synagogues.

Published in 2001 but before September 11, it has also been abridged and released in audio form.<br />The three authors describe several attempts at biological and chemical attacks that have occurred over the past fifteen or so years, like the Japanese nerve gas subway incident.  One of the more frightening sections of the book is the description of the  facilities in the Soviet Union where secret research was conducted, despite the treaty banning biological/chemical weapon development.  No records were kept, and we will never know how many human lives may have been lost in central Asia, as the Soviets viewed people of this area as expendable.  Now, a great many scientists of the former USSR are penniless, and their expertise may be for sale to Mideast nations, or to terrorists like bin Laden.<br />To me, the most chilling fact the authors present is their statement:  &quot;The military-industrial complex that supports weapons systems has little interest in vaccines and public health.&quot;  Neither do the private sector pharmaceutical companies, who pursue tremendous profits through such products as Viagra and Rogaine.  In the US, the notion of public health seemed antiquated as such diseases as polio and small pox seem to have been conquered.  Recent events have demonstrated that we must update public health systems throughout the country, as doctors and nurses are the &quot;first responders&quot; to new bio-chem threats.<br />Recombinant DNA, &quot;designer bugs&quot;, can pose tremendous threats: Taken far enough, they could even produce a slave-race of genetically-altered individuals to serve a ruling race.  There is a  bright side, which I as the mother of an autistic son, am thrilled to think about:  Research into the immune system, and auto-immune diseases, can produce cures for ailments as varied as M.S., diabetes, and autism.  Research aimed at destroying life can be used as a source for healing.<br />Now more than ever we can heed the words of St. Paul, spoken in a distant time and place yet alive with truth:  &quot;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot;as a source for healing.<br />Now more than ever we can heed the words of St. Paul, spoken in a distant time and place yet alive with truth:  &quot;Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.&quot;	2001-11-21

He has recaptured the boy he was, and &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; lets us experience the world as that boy knew it.  My husband is a cloud physicist, and reading this book helped me see how he became entranced by science, by the wonders of the physical world, metamorphosing even as we look upon it.<br />Born in l933, well before television cartoons and video games, Sacks was left to his own devices.  His broad intelligence led him down many roads, and his tolerant parents indulged his love for explorations in chemistry.  During WW II, when he was six years old, he was evacuated from London home to a country boarding school, where the headmaster inflicted physical and emotional abuse upon his young charges.  The trauma Sack underwent there, in addition to the horrors visited upon England by the war, caused him to lose faith in the omnipotent God of his Jewish tradition.  His new faith became science, and he brought to it all the passion and dedication of his orthodox forebears.<br />In adolescence, sadly, he lost this flaming enthusiam, much as many teenagers &quot;lose their faith&quot;; and he turned to the conventional medical career his parents envisioned for him.  Now, in late mid-life, his spiritual journey has brought him full circle to his early love again.  His joy in scientific enquiry will ignite a similar joy in the reader.	2001-11-20

Although the protagonists are wounded souls who are well drawn, the plot reads too much like a screenplay for an action movie. The bad guys are all bad, and there is no redemption for them. As in Klavan's most recent book, \\"Man and Wife\\", a character becomes almost a Christlife figure, giving up his own life for another.<br /><br /> As the plot unfolded, I began to hope that Amanda would use her special gifts to heal the bad guys, to change them into loving and life-affirming characters.  That would be the greater miracle, and a more ingenious plot twist than those Klavan has concocted!	2001-11-12

The book is a kind of coming-of-age story when 18 year old Homer, now a college student at VPI (which has become Virginia Tech today), returns to a Coalwood summer spent working underground.  The town has secrets which are harder to mine than the coal.  &quot;Coalwood business&quot; remains outside the knowledge of Homer, in earlier years because of his age, now because of his outsider status, as a college student and one bound for a life away from the hills of West Virginia.<br />  Slowly Homer chips away at the secrets, and at the truth of what happened one night when a fierce storm took out the electricity, stopped the ventilation in the mines, and caused a deadly buildup of methane gas.<br />  Throughout the book, Hickam writes with a tender yet tough, clear-eyed clarity, of himself on the brink of manhood, and of many other residents of Coalwood, and most especially, of his parents.  His father is dedicated to the mine and to the community, and his mother, despite her love for his father, yearns for a life far away from Coalwood. Homer, caught in the middle, is of an age to strike out for himself.  But &quot;Coalwood business&quot; keeps his home for a summer of change and discovery.  The old truths endure, and fidelity, compassion, friendship, honesty, and faith will prevail.<br />  &quot;Sky of Stone&quot; is written with warmth and humor.  The town of Coalwood as it was in l961 will come alive, and engage and entertain the reader.  Highly recommended!	2001-11-07

It could be Minnesota, it could be the upper peninsula of Michigan, Braun never specifies.  The &quot;city down south&quot; is variously, Detroit, Chicago, or Minneapolis.<br /><br />  Pickax, the community where Qwill settles in middle age after a journalist's life down south, is awash with aptly depicted small town eccentrics.

It also has that creaky, formulaic thriller style.  If it were only 200 pages long, the book would be more palatable, but over 400 pages of male-style detachment and plain delivery?<br />Female readers will find it tough to identify with Alex, with her lack of connectedness, her attitude toward (or should I say, against) children, her heroine who, at &quot;five feet ten inches tall and a hundred and ten pounds&quot; , must be skin and bones, as that weight is normal for a healthy woman of 5'2&quot;!  The demands of her career as a prosecutor, her ever-vibrating beeper, her interrupted holidays, only serve to emphasize the emptiness of her life as a woman.  Some of the narration made me laugh, as when Alex and her lover, Jake, spent a brief part of a holiday season morning &quot;calling family and friends.&quot;  (Was each call allotted maybe three minutes?)<br />One minor editing error:  A male friend has a new girlfriend whose last name is Jacobsen.  &quot;Jewish,&quot; Alex tells him.  Well, if Farstein wishes to make the girlfriend Jewish, she needs to use Jacobson as the spelling, as only Danish and Norwegian non-Jews use the &quot;sen&quot; suffix!  Such an error, in a novel meant to be worldly, is jarring.<br />In summary, Alex Cooper is not an appealing heroine, nor is Farstein an appealing writer, as both seem to subscribe to a very dated &quot;either/or&quot; formula of feminism.  It is possible &quot;to learn to make her grandma's recipe for blueberry pie&quot; without &quot;marrying at age 20 and having six kids quickly.&quot;  It is possible to marry, to bear children, to share in the female-connectedness orientation to life,  and, at the same time,to be an intelligent and sophisticated person!  Characters like Alex unfortunately only add to the hostilities between hard-driving career women and those who opt for some kind of balance between motherhood and self-expression.intelligent and sophisticated person!

I read this book three weeks into the current military action in Central Asia; it served as a tonic from an earlier time when issues, and enemies, were much more clearly defined.<br />McKay writes with an artist's eye, providing many visual details of her family's months in the jungles of the Phillippines, hiding out from Japanese invaders.  Her depiction of her parents, two mismatched people who grew closer in their struggles to survive and to nurture their daughter, is both clear-eyed and loving.  She also  brings to life the other people in her young life, fellow Americans and the native Filipinos who were generous to them.  She writes of the tropic foods they ate in order to save her father's &quot;iron rations&quot;---canned goods.<br />  She takes us through a child's growing awareness of social and political realities, of the danger and austerities faced by Americans who were trying to &quot;wait out&quot; the war in Far East.  McKay writes without a trace of self-pity, and invokes in us an admiration for the grit of her family and their friends.<br />  The author's picture shows us an attractive woman who still looks remarkably young, with that wonderful Scottish skin that wears so well.	2001-10-22

Leaving her supportive, warmly loving family in Seattle, she's a new bride who takes on chicken farming with her older husband.  He loves it.  She understandably does not.<br /><br />  Although there is much in this book to make you smile, there is also a pervading sense of melancholy, and the increasing awareness that Betty has entered into a marriage that is a mistake.  She is lonely and miserable much of the time, and her husband seems completely unresponsive to her feelings.<br />  She expresses some of the prejudices of her time; not only her views about the native coastal people, but also her attitudes about hygiene and child rearing.  She gives her infant daughter a careful daily bath but both she and her husband smoke incessantly. They are unaware of the negative health consequences of smoking, and of some other behaviors considered \\"sophisticated\\"  at the time. Although her works suffer by being dated by attitudes of a previous era, Betty is a wonderful companion, reader-friendly and funny.	2001-09-15

All new moms will identify. We have to let Patterson exercise a little literary license here, as Nicholas is a preemie who neverthless develops very precociously. The reader may feel something supernatural and shadowy here: Nicholas is indeed too good to be true, as is his father, Matthew, the ideal lover and husband.<br />  The other narrator, Katie, is &quot;good people&quot;--she tells you so herself.  Indeed, all the characters in this book are shining paragons. (Some more literary suspension of disbelief is needed, perhaps?)<br />  The book is a sweet romance to wile away an hour or two of your fast-departing summertime.

The climactic four or five pages at the end are satisfying, and all the plot ends are tied up.<br />For someone who grew up in the lake country, in the midwest as I did, the geographic setting is familiar, and Schwarz does a fine job of depicting Wisconsin land and lakescapes.  She also has a master touch in describing women's relationships-- sisters, mothers, daughters, friends.  (That is probably why Oprah latched onto the book.)

Her enthusiasm is boundless, and just leafing through this book may make you tired.<br />As I have always told friends, &quot;I hate domestic drudgery, but I hate dirt and messiness more.&quot;  For people who feel as I do, &quot;Home Comforts&quot; is a marvelous addition to your library.  My one reservation is that Mendelsohn seems to uphold hygienic standards more suitable to a hospital or surgery room.  Modern research indicates that allowing a few germs around is better for over-all health, especially for children.  This world is organic, after all, and trying to keep your residence inside a sterile bubble is not the wisest course.<br />If I could ask Mendelsohn one question, it would be, &quot;How can you ENJOY cleaning so much?&quot;  For most of us, the issue is not that we are incompetent or ignorant; it's just that cleaning is a time-consuming, mindless, and mostly thankless activity that bores the heck out of us.  Yes, the floor should be mopped, endlessly mopped; but necessity does not always foster pride or even satisfaction in doing this task.  What's her secret?  Are some people just  born cleaners?	2001-08-23

Written in erudite, Oxbridge prose, it is not just a book for scholars; it's everything you always wanted to know about food, any kind of food, raised anywhere in the wide world.<br />The entries are arranged in alphabetical fashion to expedite your research whenever you have a question; you will also enjoy just leafing through this large volume, filled with intriguing food facts.  It brings to mind one of my favorite Kipling couplets from childhood days, &quot;The world is so full of a number of things, I think we should all be as happy as kings.&quot;<br />What a feast for the reader!

Her characters, unlikable types engaged in bizarre pastimes (climbing across Maida Vale rooftops), will not engage your sympathies.<br />Vine/Rendell invokes old cliches, several more than once, like how in the eyes of 20-year-olds, people of 40 seem ancient.  These are commonplace observations, adding to the tedium of this over-long book.<br />Reading &quot;Grasshopper&quot; will make you reach for an Agatha Christie classic as a tonic!

Arvin, who wrote critically acclaimed books about Melville and Hawthorne, as well as Longfellow, helped to found the academic discipline now known as &quot;American Studies&quot;; by focussing on these gifted American writers, he helped establish a tradition of American literature and literary criticism.  Born a generation before &quot;coming out of the closet&quot; was advisable or even possible, Arvin led a furtive, secretive life.  He spent decades wrestling with his own conscience over his sexual orientation, and enduring depression, loneliness, and overwhelming feelings of guilt.  When his apartment was raided for pornography and he was put into jail, he fell apart completely, talked freely to the police, and implicated others, who also then had to stand trial.  Reading this book is a sobering and sorrowful experience.  Arvin knew very little happiness, living his constricted life in a harsh, judgmental time in this country.	2001-08-14

It's a fast-paced, demanding, all-consuming job of long hours spent preparing and cooking food in hot, crowded restaurant kitchens.  It involves dealing with food purveyors and \\"pirate crews\\" of food preparers, \\"waitrons\\", and other types of restaurant staff.<br /><br />Anthony Bourdain, who is a rangy 6'4\\"', clearly loves to eat; he  all aspects of the chef's work, from selecting food to cooking and presenting it. His enthusiasm may re-kindle kitchen inspiration in women like me, who have been responsible for putting family meals on the table for decades.<br /><br /> He reveals some behind-the-scenes secrets, like why it's not advisable to order seafood on a Monday, and of what those \\"brunches\\" may really consist---aging leftovers, concealed in viniagrette or pasta salad or other mixed dishes.<br /><br />He writes insouciantly of the frequent chaos in the kitchen, of drinking and drugging, of foul-mouthed and undependable co-workers, of rats who feast on avocados left out to ripen.

His study of Postville,Iowa, where a colony of strict Hassidic Jews have opened a hugely successful kosher slaughterhouse, is told against the backdrop of his own young family's emigration from San Francisco to the academic groves of Iowa City.<br />Bloom gets to know both the native Iowans--\\"tall, big-boned,  blonde people\\" like Garrison Keillor's Lake Woebegon folks--and the Jewish families, from Crown Heights, Brooklyn. He relishes the quick wit, the overlapping conversations, the lively warmth and good food of the Jewish Sabbath meals. He also appreciates the personal and financial integrity, and the wide-open friendliness of the native Iowans.<br />Bloom writes well of the Iowa landscape, and the summer evenings when you can hear rumblings and cracklings from the fields, sounds of the corn growing.<br />Read this book to draw your own conclusions about who excludes whom, who uses whom, and who is to blame for the animosity between the two groups.

I was surprised at this, and then, surprised at myself for my reaction. I had prided myself in possessing an egalitarian belief in the capabilities and talents of all people, and was caught up short when I realized that I had questioned the adaptability of a man from what we would call a &quot;primitive&quot; society.<br />In his Pulitzer-prize winning study, Jared Diamond broadens our thinking, providing an antidote for the idea that people from one culture are innately superior to people from any others. He discusses factors like climate, animals suited for domestication, edible native plants, geographic barriers of desert and mountains, and epidemic disease.<br />This book, despite being reader-friendly, is one that will take some concentrated time to digest. Diamond encompasses a variety of scientific disciplines---biology and anthropology, of course, but also physics and climatology, among others. He also incorporates the &quot;humanities&quot; fields of history and philosophy. In the final chapter, in what I see as evidence of both modesty and probing curiosity, he raises a number of questions for further consideration and study.	2001-06-23

This articulate essayist has produced a milestone book which addresses the frightening and ever-increasing economic disparity that marks modern-day capitalism. (If Karl Marx had her gift for apt descriptions and gripping journalism, &quot;Das Kapital&quot; would be far more widely read!)<br />She writes, &quot;The 'working poor', as they are approvingly termed, are in fact the major philanthropists of our society.  They neglect their own children so that the children of others will be cared for; they live in substandard housing so that other homes will be shiny and perfect; they endure privation so that inflation will be low and stocks high.  To be a member of the working poor is to be an anonymous donor, a nameless benefactor, to everyone else.&quot;<br />  Even the vassal-workers of medieval times may have had better lives and working conditions; there is no buffer, no benefits of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;, under world market capitalism.  Ehrenreich hauntingly depicts the day to day struggles of the marginated working poor. Her book is a stunning indictment of  soulless corporations devoted to accumulating wealth while paying their workers subsistence wages.<br />  &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot; will give new heart to members of the &quot;old left&quot;: Capitalism may yet crumble from within, falling victim to its own heritage of injustice and greed.  The system is creaking now, and present conditions cannot be sustained.  In this report from the dark, hidden underpinnings of the present &quot;prosperity&quot;, Ehrenreich reveals the exploitation of millions of American workers.  Bravo!	2001-06-01

Using a multitude of examples from books and movies, she demonstrates the many miscues men and women encounter in attempting to communicate.  Anyone who reads this book will find at least one &quot;Aha!&quot; moment, explaining a misunderstanding from the past.  Despite Tannen's efforts to legitimize both male and female styles, and to emphazise that each  gender must make an effort to be aware of the style of the other, this book may be depressing to feminists.  One of its central dilemmas, never adequately addressed, is that professional women who want to be taken seriously must learn to converse like men, even though both men and women resent this in a woman.  In many cases, to be successful, a woman must learn to give up her natural communicative style, even though men will label her &quot;too aggressive&quot; and women will find her off-putting.  Is it still &quot;a man's world&quot; after all?  Many female readers will find this book humorous in unintended ways, as a large number of them learned even as little girls talking to their father, to accept and accomodate the male style of conversation.  Most of us concluded long ago that if we want intimate sharing, we turn to our friends for &quot;girl talk.&quot;  There are some new relevations in the sections on gossip and on talking about others behind their backs, which Tannen presents as a way girls use to gain status by telling secrets about &quot;popular&quot; girls, thus seeming to be intimate with the popular ones and gaining reflected status. (This would imply that &quot;popular&quot; girls have little need for gossip, which may be true.  By the same token, a girl who frequently gossips  and  backbites cannot expect to be truly popular, since other girls will sense they cannot trust her when she is out of their presence. In my own view, I have always seen gossipy behavior as a sign of jealousy; it's definitely a &quot;low-status&quot; thing to do.)  One final observation:  Tannen makes no allowance for temperament, which can make some women outspoken and blunt, and some men sensitive and indirect.  People vary in much more than just their gender.of their presence. In my own view, I have always seen gossipy behavior as a sign of jealousy; it's definitely a &quot;low-status&quot; thing to do.)

As the mother of three twenty-something unmarried daughters, I'm thankful for the perspective it offers. Yalom writes with balance and humor, and her work will enable the reader to learn in-depth about the varied attitudes toward courtship, marriage, and the role of the wife, in other times and places.  As a Lay Carmelite, I was especially intrigued by the Puritans, who placed a high value on mutual love, but emphasized that love should not be confused with romantic passion, and was never meant to rival the love of God.  Yalom calls their approach &quot;affection in harmony with duty and reason.&quot;  As a veteran of a marriage of more than thirty years' duration, I would heartily concur with that description, and would hope that my daughters enter into such satisfying and enduring unions.	2001-05-17

He can be compared to March King John Philip Sousa, who also embraced a formal genre which other composers may have found stultifying.  It is evidence of the time-defying talents of both men that their later work is as fresh and engaging as the efforts of their youth, and as unlimited by the highly structured forms they both chose.  People hearing a Sousa march today are as taken with its infectious high spirits as those who heard it a hundred years ago.  I believe that Wilbur's poems will prove as moving and as enduring.  The best poem is the title work, &quot;Mayflies.&quot;  As a Lay Carmelite I especially savor the lines,  &quot;...called to be/ Not fly or star/ But one whose task is joyfully to see/ How fair the fiats of the caller are.&quot;  Read this life-enhancing poem, and draw nearer to the Caller who created stars and mayflies, and poets too!	2001-03-20

Over the nearly four hundred pages of the novel, Emma's company wears a little thin. She is a fully realized character, but with all the limitations of her age; her passionate likes and dislikes loom large in the story--and frankly, they are predictable to the point of being cliched.  The mystery slowly, oh so slowly, unravels.  This tale could have been told more cleanly and concisely in half the time.

It also reflects her own anxiety and sorrow; as a woman in her mid-to-late 30s, she's been unable to conceive.  Here also we find the typical less-than-broad sample of educated, motivated women in the upper-middle-class. Judging from books on women's issues in recent years, a foreign visitor would think that's the only bracket in US society. Once again, the hard-pressed working-class women do not appear.  I realize that Orenstein's interviewees are from the group that purchases and reads books like hers; others have not the time, money, or inclination.  Still, it's disconcerting not to have ALL working women represented.<br /><br /> I have one burning question which I've yet to see satisfactorily answered by Orenstein and her ilk.  Are these concerned, educated, articulate women familiar with socio-biology?  There are well documented and striking differences between the sexes.  Women yearn for children as men yearn for women/sex.  This is not just folk-knowledge, or some mythic \\"wisdom of the ages.\\"  This is fact.<br /><br />When my children were infants, La Leche League leaders used to talk about \\"cultural\\" v. \\"biological\\" femininity, to differentiate between societal expectations and physical fact. For many years, \\"culture\\" dictated that some women could not breast-feed; this is biologically incorrect.  Today, \\"culture\\" sometimes seems to dictate that women should postpone childbearing, postpone marriage even, until they have \\"succeeded\\" in a demanding work environment.  It also assumes that men can nurture in the same way as women.  Biology dictates otherwise.  It would be eye-opening for Orenstein and other writers like her to read the research on gender differences.  They might be  surprised to see how quickly their agonizing over decisions and  roles, could disappear.	2000-12-06

The narrator, Linda, is an artist who notices lines, colors, details.  She is remarkably observant about outer details, but is uninformed, even naive, about inner details, about the emotional component of situations, about the true feelings of people. In these pages, we follow her inward journey as she learns more about the people of her small Iowa town.  In the process she learns more about herself and how she is perceived by others.  As Howard's tale unfolds, some mysteries are revealed.  Other matters are left ambiguous.  Howard's book, in the style of Ruth Rendell, makes demands on the reader:  Some &quot;facts&quot; must be inferred, and other surprising facts must be assimiliated into the general plot.  &quot;Discovering the Body&quot; is not a quick, toss-away pleasure, but it offers satisfaction to the patient reader.	2000-11-28

Since it took place in wartime, and during the bombing of civilians in  European cities, it was overlooked by chroniclers of that period.  O'Nan's  style, which brings up personal stories of many people caught up in the  fire, reminds me of Walter Lord's classic &quot;A Night to Remember,&quot;  about the Titanic sinking.  Here are heroes and villains, and, very sadly,  many children.  O'Nan describes the admirable response of Hartford's  policemen, firemen, medical personnel, and people of other agencies, who  were ready for this devastating event due to their &quot;emergency  preparedness&quot; wartime stance.

The tenor of this book ranges from erudite detachment to  passionate opinion: On a scale from cynical despair to hopeful optimism, it  leans toward the latter.<br />  There are a few minor editing flaws:  As a  musician, I must point out the Handel's oratorio is called simply  &quot;Messiah,&quot; not &quot;The Messiah;&quot; and there are other  mistakes that could have been caught by careful proofreading, but in a work  of this size, these are perhaps unavoidable.<br />  As the spouse of a cloud  physicist, I think he could have given more pages and appreciation to all  the marvels &quot;techne&quot; has rendered; as the mother of an adult  daughter whose life was spared recently in an emergency by surgical  intervention, I think he also could have lauded more fully another branch  of &quot;techne&quot;, modern medicine.<br />  This does not detract from  his marvelous accomplishment.

Since he was essentially alone, with rather formidable demands  placed upon him by her Alzheimer's ailment, he coped by retreating into  memories.  In this situation, his memories were strikingly vivid, and  reminded me of the  memory-influenced dreams I had during my pregnancies,  when my waking hours were racked by nausea.  The memories were not so much  a comfort to him, as a reminder of the fullness, the  &quot;worth-whileness&quot; of life.  I recognize this, having experienced  it, as a natural way of getting through a difficult time.<br />  Iris is a  strong presence in this memoir, but it tells us more about this thoughtful,  intellectual, sensitive, and good man.  The deep love the two shared is  apparent, yet it is not put on display in the arrogant manner, the &quot;no  two people ever loved as we did, no one ever had the adventures we did or  knew the famous people we did&quot; attitude of some other authors.

Elaine Mar for her hard work, her achievements of acculturation and academic study. It's a long way from the crowded apartments of Hong Kong to the halls of Harvard. She is young, and it's perhaps a little too early for her to attempt a memoir. Let's hear more later! Her elementary school years are given to us in vivid detail, and the humiliation she endured is still fresh and stinging. One can only hope that teachers are more proactive these days, intervening and preventing cruelties, than they seem to be in the '70s. My city has an enormous tide of immigration from Asia, and I tried to ensure that my own children were friendly and welcoming to these latest Americans. I told them that, except for the native tribes, we are ALL immigrants, whether our ancestors came on the Mayflower or on a TWA flight from Manila. I wish that M. Elaine, as a young child, could have known more children with this attitude. The tales from her teenage years are also fresh---too fresh for her to be objective about them. I wonder if she realizes that \\"re-inventing yourself\\", chiefly by dissociating from your parents, is a common phenomonon of American life. Of course, her dissociation had to be more radical than most; and it is still too recent. How can I put this kindly----sometimes, her arrogance and self-centeredness are altogether too much on display, as when she tosses out all the lovely clothes a kind friend had given her to take to college; no second-hand outfits and no condescension for her! Didn't she stop to think that maybe some other girl, not so stiffbacked and proud, would delight in having those clothes? Why put them into the trash?<br /> I hope that eventually, in maturity, M.Elaine will reunite her with her parents and her extended family, and the riches of an ancient and honorable culture. I hope that she will begin to know in her heart, the courage, sacrifice, and guidance of her intelligent parents (does she think she \\"re-invented\\" her own mental gifts?) Let's hear more from her when that begins to happen!ifts?) Let's hear more from her when that begins to happen!	2000-08-10

I found it enjoyable yet I do have reservations about  the &quot;docu-drama&quot; style of imagined conversations, emotions, and  memories, which to my  mind, trivializes real events. I realize the  constraints which the author faced, as all the characters are long dead,  not available for interviewing.<br />  It is a gripping, elemental story of  a situation few of us like to think about.  One fact is particularly  haunting:  Sometimes men on leanly-provisioned ships would &quot;not  see&quot; a small boat of desperate people, fearing that if they rescued  them, there would not be enough food for all. Leaders of shipwrecked  survivors would have to instruct some of them to hide in the bottom of the  boat so that a ship would approach.  So much for  brave captains and the  noble code of the sea!	2000-08-10

Betty Fussell is original and engaging; her work is detailed and sensuous like that of the medieval bard. At one point she quotes an even more famous bard, Shakespeare, \\"An expense of spirit in a waste of shame,\\" referring to the obsessive amount of time and energy she and her faculty-wife peers spent on their elaborate party meals.<br /> One doesn't have to be overly perceptive to realize how good food became such a priority in her life, as she tells us how all the food was \\"mush\\" in her childhood; or to realize that, however odd it may seem, she was relieved, even \\"euphoric\\"(her own word) at the loss of her third and last baby, since from an early age, she lacked a loving mother herself.<br /> Most of her book is about the postWWII era, an anomaly in American life, a time of great prosperity when even English professors made very good money and were able to acquire large, lovely houses and to make frequent trips to live for months at a time in Europe. Denied a career of her own in those pre-feminist times, she poured her efforts into cooking and became an \\"amateur\\" expert. (She even moaned the invention of the Cuisinart food processor, which made obsolete all those whisks and grates and sieves she had worked so hard to collect.) In an era of outwardly conservative conformity, she tells us of the troubled marriages and casual adulteries that seemed to be the norm in her circle. She had her heart broken twice: By a writer with whom she carried on an affair that lasted years, and by her husband, whom she caught in a homosexual encounter with one of his students.<br /> I love my Cuisinart. I have been a \\"faculty wife\\" now for as long as she was, and, like all my friends, my time has been taken up with wider causes than gourmet wooden spoons and garlic presses. Yet my heart goes out to this articulate woman, born less than twenty years before I was, whose life was so constrained and frustrating. There is a wrenching sadness about this book, despite the easy and prosperous era of its setting.presses.

Unlike the extremists who  entered the women's movement after her, she is balanced and moderate.  &quot;I've always thought of women's liberation as men's liberation as  well.&quot;  She says about what she might want on her gravestone,  &quot;She helped make a world where women feel good about being women and  free to really love men.&quot;  A recurring motif in her memoir is what she  calls her &quot;Jewish existential conscience&quot;, a feeling that she has  to use her life to make the world better.  (The &quot;Christian  correlation&quot; might be, Jesus' parable of the use of talents.) She has  indeed been a friend to women----and to men--everywhere.	2000-08-07

Trevor  Rees-Jones found an articulate advocate in Moira Johnston, who helped him  with the book.  Here we have a portrait of an appealing young man from a  sturdy British family, caught up in a horror that nearly took his life.  The book depicts several major struggles: The medical struggle, the  extensive facial surgery in addition to his many other injuries; the  emotional struggle of his brave family, especially his &quot;mum&quot;  Jill, to remain upbeat; Trevor's struggle with his loyalty to Fayed and his  slow realization that he must end his employment with him.  The book is  a deceptively quick read, and you come away from it feeling that you know  Trevor and his family well, and find much to admire in them.	2000-08-06

She has laid aside her historian's objectivity to tell us bits of her own life story. I hadn't realized that many same-sex involvements were looked upon more tolerantly in earlier times. The entrenched positions, pro and con, that are present today, are anomalies, considering the history she provides. One comes away from the book, also, with an appreciation for the confusions and mysteries that still cloud our view of same-sex attachments. No one has the answers, and no research thus far has explained why things happen this way. As a hetero wife and mother of four, I must admit that I have very little understanding of the feelings of gays and lesbians, especially since my own view of female sexuality is not limited to just the male-female attraction, and copulation. To me, female sexuality is that and much more---it is bound up also with maternity, with conceiving, bearing, and raising one's children, with breast-feeding one's babies, with nurturing a family, with holding grandchildren in your arms. Rupp makes one weak reference to \\"diffuse female sexuality.\\" Yes, it is diffuse, compared to male behavior. I can understand \\"romantic friendships\\" as Rupp describes them. Most girls go through this stage as young adolescents, and throughout their lives, most women treasure their female friends, who often are able to provide more necessary emotional support than their husbands. Yet somehow it seems sad to me that lesbians live their lives outside the fulfillment of diffuse female sexuality, which involves a male partner, pregnancy, nursing---a rich, heterosexual family life.	2000-08-06

Ironically, Gordon  may be a good choice to write this &quot;biography&quot;, as Joan is a  controversial, poorly understood figure, distant from us in that medieval  world so different from our own.  In my judgement, Gordon has produced a  book that is also controversial and difficult to understand!  Two things do  come through, though, that even Gordon cannot obscure:  Joan's unwavering  faith, and her glorious love for the Lord.	2000-08-06

The detective's own voice comes through, strong and  passionate, in every page.  His clear-minded account is by far the best of  all the JonBenet books.  It is depressing to hear how the botching of the  investigation from the first minutes through many, many futile months, and  the &quot;Let's make a deal&quot; politics of the D.A.'s office,  combined  with the &quot;New Age&quot; methods of high ranking Boulder police  administrators, all came together to deny justice to a six-year old girl.  Thank goodness for men of integrity like Detective Thomas, who are able to  cut through the smoke and the rhetoric to paint a clear picture of a tragic  incident.  Whatever your theory about what really happened, this book will  provide you with information to make an informed judgement.	2000-05-18
US	49808679	R3GSTKANWBH2FK	0871137658	553666976	In the Fall	Books	3	5	12	N	N	love as rescue	Jeffrey Lent is to be commended for a fine first novel, filled with detailed descriptions of New England in a previous era. He also gives us a poignant portrayal of how slavery overshadowed the lives of both black and  white people yet to be born at the time of the War.  The inner lives of his  characters are poetically revealed to us, with such an impact that we think  about them as we go through our own days.  However, like so many male  writers, he misunderstands the hearts of his female characters.  Indeed,  the central plot hinge,the suicide of Leah, alienates her from women  readers, who will find it hard to understand a mother leaving a five year  old son in this fashion, however desperate she feels her circumstances to  be.  Also, in a plot twist  borrowed perhaps from the sci-fi genre, in each  generation the central characters meet their mates  by being rescued in  dire straits, fed, and given carnal comfort. From this springs life-long  commitment?  A lot of literary license needs to expended to use &quot;love  as rescue&quot; not once, but three times.	2000-04-21

Teresa is often misunderstood, even caricatured, but Medwick  strives to show us a clear picture of this woman who was both extremely  simple and wondrously complex. Teresa was well acquainted with the world,  yet fell passionately in love with her Lord, who called her to look beyond  the world into an eternal relationship with Him.  Hers was the ancient and  ever-new Carmelite experience. I somewhat expected a kind of sneering irony  in tone, but, thankfully, I never encountered it, as Medwick did a  scholarly and earnest job throughout.  Kudos to her, whose account is well  researched and compelling, a real-page turner.	2000-04-06

The opening is promising, but it soon degenerates into an  &quot;adventure&quot; tale with gauzy plotting which relies more on action  than on character.  The events depicted in the book are unlikely, and the  writing is at a level more suited to a young adolescent readership.  I  think she &quot;mailed it in&quot; this time, without her usual pungent  insights, interesting and complex characters, and quality writing.  I hope  to see the return of Richard Jury in her next work.	2000-03-27

Symptoms include the inability to put this volume down,  dark circles under the eyes from staying up late, and an irresistible  impulse to tell all one's friends about the book.&quot;  Ann Rule is the  premier true-crime writer in the country, and her works fly off bookstore  shelves.  Libraries have lengthy &quot;on hold&quot; lists.  She takes a  compelling story and with riveting, insightful prose, provides us with a  wide cast of characters.  Some evoke empathy from the reader, and some  evoke outright horror.  &quot;...And Never Let Her Go&quot; presents us  with a trusting, affectionate, vivacious young woman who was murdered by  her lover. The killer was a man who behind his facade as a successful,  respected attorney, was coldhearted and utterly selfish. Like all of Rule's  books, this one is well-researched and filled with extensive  characterizations, not only of the victim and the killer but also of the  people surrounding them.  Rule has unequalled story-telling talents, and  each of her books is a savory treat for her millions of readers.	1999-12-11

The author has done a commendable job of thoroughly covering all the plays as well as the sonnets and other poems.  It's as  delicious and easy to digest as partly melted ice cream.

This  book is a wonder, filled with common-sense wisdom. Over the years I have  given it to many new mothers, and referred to it, and quoted from it,  hundreds of times. From instructions on how to survive the exhausting early  weeks, to detailed explanations of creative projects a pre-schooler can do. \\"The hours are terrible, right from the start, but remember, at least  you are the boss!\\" Yes, young mothers, you are in charge of these  fast-passing days.

His concerns  the Big Question,&quot;What shall I do with my life?&quot; Can he endure  the rigors of Michigan football to keep a full-ride scholarship as a ticket  out of Cleveland, or will he return and begin &quot;loading Hilos into  trucks&quot; for a living?  Reid's story is less an expose of the rough,  physically punishing regimes of an offensive lineman, than it is a tale of  his inner struggles and less-than-enlightened behavior.  He seems to  gravitate toward team members who resembles characters from the film  &quot;Animal House.&quot;  When he joins another team member in stealing  items from the team equipment room, his actions are perhaps meant to reveal  to us his ambivalent feelings about playing football; instead, what comes  across is the considerable self-destructive streak that compromises his  &quot;ticket out.&quot;  Reid's book is not an indictment of college  football, however he may have intended it.  &quot;If I Don't Six&quot; is  yet another coming-of-age novel, another story of a young man's journey  toward maturity, complete with the many irrational detours that occur along  the way.	1999-06-20
