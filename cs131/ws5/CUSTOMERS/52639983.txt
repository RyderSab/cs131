Famous(almost too much so-eclipsing these other, superior and more personal books)for the \\"Gnomes\\" series of books of the 1970s, he was a man of amazing talent, terrific humor and also great humanity and sensitivity.  Any of his books are worth having; this title, \\"Dogs\\" was the first I discovered, and it's also one of the very few easily available at this writing(9/05).  Here are studies of many, many breeds of canines rendered in luscious oils, stunningly--but even better is the rest of the book:  Poortvliet's own, intimate life experiences with dogs, a kind of illustrated diary done in pen, pencil and watercolor washes--absolutely brilliant.  You'll meet and love Rien's dogs as he did, and if you've any interest or care for dogs at all this will likely become your favorite.  I'd recommend this over any other coffee table or \\"art\\" book for dog lovers(I can't conceive of anyone not savoring this)...and for artists--!  Wow.  An absolute treasure trove of quick gesture drawings, studies and attitudes of both dogs AND people--as well as any other animal Rien feels like writing about and sketching--and there are plenty of them.  This will teach the interested artist more than dozens of \\"how to\\" books of painting and drawing techniques could hope to do.  Don't hesitiate--order it now.	2005-09-28

I've dipped into several of them, and usually I'm disppointed by generically \\"quirky\\" characters and, especially,  contrived dialogue and/or predictable situations.  Still, I'm a lover of classic films and ghost stories, as well as getting into the mystery mood by a recent re-discovery of the exceptional \\"Mr. and Mrs. North\\" series of the 1940s.  How gratified I was to find that after impulsively buying \\"The Ghost and the Dead Deb\\" at my local mystery bookshop it's just as worthy an effort as the better books written some 60 years ago.<br /><br />The author manages to create believable characters--both living and dead, and even work in a frisson of romance--just enough to be wonderfully satisfying.  It's been a long time since I've found a lead female character who doesn't irritate the heck out of me by her shallowness or unreal behaviour.  This one is carefully drawn.  The mystery itself is tops, but most importantly you just plain care about these people.  Here's a real writer!  Looking forward to more.	2005-09-14

I'm not in the least \\"ashamed\\" of reading a book that absolutely IS written for the children's section(unlike some others, including the author herself, I can't agree that--even if I can and do enjoy the HP books--these are NOT written with no particular age group in mind-rubbish.  They're obviously based on a very old and formulaic model, the british school series a la \\"Malory Towers\\", etc., albeit with magic thrown in-and what magic!  Best things about all of them.  They are not anything like as deep or age-spanning as the Narnian Books, or Lloyd Alexander's, or Ursula LeGuin's, or E. Nesbit's).<br /><br />But the fact is that Rowling's talent lies in her invention, not, alas, in her character development and plotting.  It's a rather big failing that she hasn't perhaps had proper time to address in the last several years of fast writing.  As a result, the little things that were just eye-rollers in books 1-5 become more annoying in 6: Ron & Hermoine's sniping, Snape's and Malfoy's outrageously horrible behaviour towards other students, the name-dropping of various characters and places and catchphrases that every kid and most adults on earth have become overfamiliar with, etc.etc.--all these have become a rather largish pain the arse.  For instance I counted no less than 3 times where Ron and/or Harry \\"choked\\" on their food(stuffed in their mouths in a way I'd buy in an 11 year old, NOT a 16 year old!)because Hermoine read aloud a seemingly \\"alarming\\" squib in the Daily Prophet to them(don't these boys ever read??); Way, WAY too much \\"telling/not showing\\" as in people saying things \\"angrily\\", \\"furiously\\" etc. etc. amongst other incredibly redundant devices...the weirdly creepy way she chose to make metaphorical Harry's crush on a girl as a \\"roaring beast\\" in his chest(!)...the fact, noticed by many others here, that Harry is a frankly lousy wizard compared to Hermoine and others; Harry's continued insistence that HE knows the TRUTH, and of course even though he's been through untold adventures with his friends, who've seen Draco try to KILL him on a couple of occasions--suddenly, for the purposes of PLOT--they don't believe him for a minute...and on and on.  I also felt, strangely but strongly, that for a female writer Rowling really writes as though she were a fusty old male misogynist.  She actually has as many negative, stupid images of \\"silly\\", stereotyped girls and horrible, evil decadent witches in her writing as C.S. Lewis, a man born in 1900 who was a famous old chauvinist...come ON!  There's just loads of things that unfortunately show up how hollow the character development and plotting is in this series.  The best parts--imho the things that set her apart and make her work memorable--is her descriptive imagination, not her writing ability.  There's less of the former on show here, resulting in a less satisfying read.hough he's been through untold adventures with his friends, who've seen Draco try to KILL him on a couple of occasions--suddenly, for the purposes of PLOT--they don't believe him for a minute...and on and on.

The number one thing wrong with this book isn't the lascivious story and attitude(yes, it's possible to be liberally-minded about sex--even about sexual longings and exploration of children), it's the lame and unbelievable writing.<br /><br />The number two thing wrong is its leering, idiotic and insulting take on teenage girls.  These books have been around forever--decades, in fact--but with each passing generation they've gotten more and more explicit and exploitative.  That last adjective is the perfect one to describe this trashy Jacqueline Susann for young girls: exploitative.  Does the author really care two cents about what happens to teen girls in a world seemingly hopelessly screwed up as concerns matters sexual, or the problem of sex education(or total lack of)?<br /><br />Or does he want to write a book so \\"Ooooh! SHOCKING!\\" that it rockets to the top of bestseller lists and makes him (and the publisher) a ton of money?

For an actor who's clearly taken his \\"writing\\" very seriously for the last 30 odd years, Mr. Wilder's writing style is disappointingly perfunctory, sounding either dictated, heavily edited, or just plain poor.<br /><br />Old friend Mel Brooks loyally declares it \\"hilarious\\" in his jacket blurb, but there isn't a laugh in the book.  To the contrary, Gene Wilder may be the most pompous, narcissistic, UNfunny comic actor who ever wrote a petulant, score-settling, obtuse autobiography.  While the subtitle is \\"my search for love and art\\", he never writes about anything of the kind; not one word about how he writes screenplays, the creative process-nothing to do with art in any form.  It's really misleading.  Further, the interludes(which act as filler for much of the slim volume)with his analyst are not only self-serving, they're enough to turn anyone off from serious therapy, suggesting as they do that the analyst's job is merely to reassure the subject no matter how they feel or what they do to others.  Or perhaps that's just the way some analysts treat famous celebrities.  The worst passages are those dealing with Wilder's daughter, the birth daughter of his second wife, about 10 when he adopted her, who, through what seems a huge sin of omission on Wilder's part is currently estranged from him.  These scenes are a new low in self-awareness on the part of this or any author.  His total self-involvement, his utter lack of understanding of anything from anyone else's point of view-in particular(and this is a key, running theme in his life)his revulsion at ANYone \\"needing\\" him-even when, as in his daughter's case, she's seriously ill and hospitalized-are the most blindly unflattering things I've read in a long time.<br /><br />So, as biography:  not much there.  As revelatory self-analysis: ditto.  As an eye-opener in how very different an actor's true self is from the projected image the audience gets courtesy of various roles:  sadly potent stuff.<br /><br />I also couldn't agree more with the more generous reviewer below who noted the underlying-and quite intense-anger Gene Wilder seems to feel towards so many aspects and people of his life.

And it is a *supplement*, not exactly a complete book in its own right.  Not that there's anything wrong with that:  Ms. Becker is a very different, very individual voice among the others who knew Sylvia, very much her own person-another writer, another mother, not a genius, but definitely a friend-and frankly, the sort of friend Plath desperately needed, and one we'd all be well-off to be able to turn to in despair, as Sylvia famously(well, it's famous *now*)did in the last days of her life.  Some of the observations here, never repeated anywhere else, are indeed \\"haunting\\": the wearying task of sitting up all night with an emotionally disturbed girlfriend, at wit's end about exactly what to do; the unsettling visit of Becker to Plath's apartment to fetch neccessary items, finding the place eerily clean and apparently empty of children's clothes(Plath had two toddlers); the abrupt changes in Plath's moods, the memory of Sylvia, dressed to the nines, about to go out on the next-to-last evening of her life for a mysterious \\"date\\"(with her husband?  with another suitor?  We'll never know)stopping at the door to smile down at her baby son and tell him warmly, \\"I love you\\"-these are the sorts of observations that could come firsthand from only an intimate, if not a longterm friend. The memories regarding Ted Hughes' behaviour after Plath's suicide are something else again-quite a shock, and also quite believeable.  You won't find much of that elswhere, either.<br /><br />The thing about Plath memoirs and writings is that all of them seem to offer little pieces of the massive puzzle that was the poet and the woman. This is one more small piece that I'm very grateful was published.'m very grateful was published.	2005-01-20
US	52639983	RN10RNH6OIIS6	0520056892	382208138	Backstory 1: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood's Golden Age (No. 1)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A must-have resource	I own a library of approximately 1,000 titles relating to film-as well as having worked for several years in a film-specific bookshop.  That said-this particular volume, a collection of interviews with some of the most important names in the history of screenwriting, is one I'd rank among the top ten must-have titles for anyone seriously interested in movies.  It's that good.<br /><br />First off, in my opinion there's no better source for history than first-person statements of professionals, and that's what these interviews are all about.  It's great when a talented author produces an interesting biography or history of the Hollywood studios' \\"golden age\\"-but how much better to read the raw, (virtually, presumably) uncensored memories!  From this book, with its several dozen subjects, you'll get a taste of just about everything to do with filmmaking: the dealings with the front office, studio politics, actors, directors, censorship, the blacklist(BOTH sides of that terrible period-from SEVERAL perspectives-fascinating and unusual), life in general during the depression and oh, yes--the peculiar job of screenwriting.<br /><br />I can't think how often I've pulled this one down off the shelf to refresh my memory, and also-it's tremendously entertaining reading--some of it is laugh-out-loud hilarious.  These were talented men and women, folks-witty, often brilliant, with a unique perspective on the art of film.  Patrick McGilligan does a masterful job of editing; reading his cogent and sensitive introductions to each interview is a great added bonus.  My hat's off to him as to all too few other writers on this subject(Kevin Brownlow among them).  Really, if you're the least bit interested in the history of Hollywood OR in screenwriting, you've got to have this.	2005-01-20

Once upon a time, there was a woman who wrote for a living, and people were edified, entertained, infuriated, intrigued, or titillated.  She'd had an interesting life in interesting times and with some interesting, dynamic, famous people.  Then she grew older, \\"settled down\\", became extremely domestic in the countryside, and let her writing get so sloppy and slapdash it would embarrass an 8th grader-a bright 8th grader.<br /><br />I, too, am a horse person; I own, ride, have taken part in the hunt(although out here in CA it's coyotes, not foxes-and we usually catch nothing, thank God); in my review of \\"Outfoxed\\" I made a suggestion echoed by another reader here:  Rita Mae should definitely write NON-fiction, sticking to what she knows and loves best:  riding, hunting, dogs, Virginia country-elite living.  Nothing wrong with that.  But instead she has to pay the bills and feed the demands of her editors(who are, after all, in the publishing business to make money-the more, the better), and it's just so obvious from this effort that her heart isn't in it; the \\"characters\\" are paper-thin, and resultingly boring-even the animal ones.  The \\"mystery\\"-well,I am the dimmest of mystery readers-usually way behind the solution, though I hate to admit it, in even a mediocre mystery-but in this book(and her other Sneaky Pies)it's so flimsily plotted that not only can you figure it out immediately-you couldn't care less! What a shame.  There's such a thing as stringing one's talent and reputation along a bit too far.  This is proof.	2004-10-11

As others here have been detailed in their various reports, I'll simply say that while I appreciate Ms. Leach's search for \\"truth\\" as regards Carroll's life, and her unwillingness to simply take as gospel the often-expresed line that he was a (probably unconsummated) pedophile, I do think she throws the baby out with the bathwater in this too short but nevertheless  repetitive book.<br /><br />First, I'll say that I strongly agree with Leach that poor Lewis Carroll(real name Charles Dodgson)has been grossly misunderstood and is STILL, in this supposedly enlightened age, misrepresented as a victorian Humbert Humbert(\\"Lolita\\"), BUT she tries way, way too hard to get over the idea that, really, Carroll cared little or nothing for Alice Liddell, his \\"muse\\" and the girl for whom his greatest work was written!  This is done by way of mentioning the three or four \\"unflattering\\" remarks Carroll made in letters or his diary, and making whopping omissions of the fact that he not only photographed this little girl much more extensively at the time than any other child, in many more imaginative ways(she was clearly and in his own words his favorite model, at least) but often and warmly DID express just how \\"special\\" she was as a person, in his opinion.  He did this so often that Leach has to do backflips to ignore loads of material Carroll himself wrote, as it would blow her contention that he was no more interested in Alice than in any other kid.  True-when Alice grew a bit older-older than, say, 12-she apprently became a bit of a sulky adolescent(hardly unusual then or now), and obviously didn't prefer Carroll's company as she had from the ages of 4 to 10.  I am most bugged that Leach pointedly chooses NOT to quote from one of the last letters the old Carroll wrote to the then much older matron Alice: \\"I have had scores of child-friends since your time, but they have been quite a different thing\\".  While I *don't* believe he sexually loved little Alice, it's obvious that he *loved* the charming, spiritually pure, endearing, pretty and photogenic little toddler Alice very much indeed.  Perhaps as a creative artist(which he very much was-with his camera-as good as any painter of the day)it was Alice's unusual looks which entranced him more than anything else.  But to suggest that she had NO pride of place in Carroll's life is just not supported by the tiny amount of highly ambiguous \\"evidence\\" Leach found among the Carroll family papers.<br /><br />I'd agree with another poster that unfortunately the author makes a big deal out of this \\"important discovery\\"-dragging out it's \\"reveal\\" until far too late in the book, and padding the rest of it quite a bit. It doesn't work as exactly scholarship OR as an afficionado's book-length treatise/biography.  The only really valuable thing about it is her very sensible description of the context of victorian \\"child-worship\\"-in other words, why Carroll was NOT a weirdo for doing nude photographs of children-little girls, and why it's apparently impossible for our modern pundits to understand this.

While a load of these sorts of books abounds right now, this author comes to her task honestly: she lived in France for 10 years, and from her likeable photo on the back cover, she's the kind of american everywoman whose point of view really might come in handy for those of us who wouldn't mind picking up a little french style.  I thought her take on french women was admiring withOUT lapsing into the sort of &quot;self-hating american&quot; all-things-european adoration I've seen plenty of in various fashion magazines.  Really a collection of ruminations on what it means to be french.  And sociologists take note:  her pages on the VERY different approach frenchwomen take to interpersonal relations(when meeting a new person/potential gal pal, general socializing,  office demeanor, etc.)are from my limited experience absolutely on the money.  In addition to the entertainment value, I'm going to try to adopt the described &quot;french&quot; qualities of self-restraint in gabbing, at least; I'm sure my success will be limited, but every little soupcon helps!	2004-05-10

She read from \\"Ella Enchanted\\" and I was hooked.  I should say I am *not* the target audience-I'm an over-30 woman who illustrates for children myself, and I still reread my favorite stories from my childhood, rarely picking up new YA novels-because usually from a skimming in the bookstore I don't find ones well-written enough to bother buying.  This one is happily different.  It's not perfect, but it IS well above average in its writing quality, the author has a way with characters that takes it out of the two-dimensional realm of all too many fantasies, and she's got a great, often very original imagination.  Somehow she manages to paint both a fantasy world and the inner life of a very frustrated, willful teen girl equally well.  I'm sure this is and will continue to be many girls' \\"favourite book\\".<br />That said, I'll add one caveat: I have to agree with another reviewer who mentioned their disappointment with the portrayal of the \\"ugly stepsisters\\":  basically, to fully get across their inherent meanness and \\"ugliness\\", they're depicted as not only stupid(really, in the case of the younger one, borderline \\"developmentally disabled\\"), but-horror of horrors!-FAT.  That is to say, \\"piggish\\" in every sense of the word.  There are scenes of Ella, the heroine, nauseated at the sight of these two wolfing down food, dribbling it on their double chins and staining their clothes by their pure gluttony.  All well and good, maybe-but this is supposed to be very much a \\"modern\\" fairy tale, in the sense of turning the cliches on their heads, and it's a real shame that Ms. Levine's imagination failed her here.  She might have chosen to play AGAINST the \\"Grimm's fairy tale\\" type, and have the stepsisters be ugly only on the INSIDE-certainly it's unfortunate in a book for young girls to equate obesity with stupidity and greed and everything ugly.  Same goes for the portrait of the stepmother.  Actually, in my experience, this sort of status-conscious, elitist person is always rail-thin(to the point of anorexia), hardly \\"plump\\"-but that's much more grotesque to Levine, apparently.<br />Otherwise, a swell book.the stepmother.

So shallow and underdeveloped it makes &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; seem like a real epic.  There is NO PLOT.  None.  Not even any sort of a stab at a plot.<br />Clearly meant to be OTT satire, but it simply isn't funny enough...or really, funny at ALL.  No laughs I could find. The author apparently has zero, and I mean zero, imagination.  Everything is laid out in an obvious fashion, and worst of all it reads as though it was written by a frothing-at-the-mouth fasionista wanna-be who worked RILLY, RILLY HARD at researching all the &quot;in&quot; places and labels and stuff, rather than by a person who actually partakes of any of these rareified things.

She's bright, she loves old movies passionately(this was quite a bit more iconoclastic back when she was living it, in the 80s, than it is now in the era of TCM-though it was certainly never as unusual as she'd have her readers believe)-enough to fantasize about what good friends she'd have been with Carole Lombard, if only they'd lived at the same time...yikes.<br />Basically, this soul-searching, well-heeled Valley girl disguises her &quot;Ghost World&quot; disaffection with her peers as something of a definable disability for a rare, tender intellectual such as herself.  Truly, it inadvertantly comes off as a slightly lazy and very spoiled Daddy's girl finding yet another way to wrap her famous, well-off and successful parents around her little finger and get out of boring old assignments, getting up early, doing reading and writing she doesn't *want* to do, etc.  Plenty of ruminations and observations and fantasies of herself as the Katharine Hepburn character in &quot;Holiday&quot;...yikes.  This would NEVER have been published but for the influence of her parents, as there's nothing here that's new if you're over 19.  At the time of its original publication, the author hit the circuit hard, doing all kinds of press where her incredible, Hepburnesque mannered way of speaking(has to be heard to be believed)was more interesting than anything she had to say...telling that she's done nothing in the public eye since.  What'd *really* be interesting would be an &quot;update&quot; of how her life has evolved(hopefully) beyond the end of her nose in the last 20 years.	2004-03-12

In reviewing \\"According to Queeney\\"[review excerpted above],Publisher's Weekly wrote: \\"...few novelists now alive can match Bainbridge for the uncanny precision with which she enters into the ethos of a previous era.\\"<br />Uncanny?  Yes. Very weird.  Precise?  I absolutely don't think so-unless you'd believe that 18th century upper-class people lived in a constant state of misery due to(among other things)clinical depression, sexual repression, religious fanaticism and/or hypocrisy, disease, and the lack of indoor plumbing.  My main problem with this book is its unremitting unpleasantness, both of tone and character, and its rather superficial assumption that there's some kind of need to dispel an imagined rosy picture of \\"ye olden days\\" by swinging wildly in the other direction: a modernist, disaffected, determinedly downbeat view of humanity.<br />There isn't a single likeable person in the book, nor does anyone seem to escape either madness, disease, bitterness, selfishness, hate, gluttony, stupidity, addiction-or a combination of the above.  It's one thing to make one's central characters complex, another to divest them of anything positive, save, supposedly, intelligence.  An author runs a great risk-and takes on a huge responsibility-when she chooses to write a fictional \\"novel\\" using real people, places, and events.  Perhaps it's just me, but I believe that she owes these onetime living, breathing people something better-at least, something a little more considered than simply using them as objects on which to hang some imagined psychodramas.  Yes, Johnson was a strange man...that's hardly news to anyone who's read anything about his personal life and habits.  As for \\"Queeney's\\" mother, longtime Johnson friend Mrs. Thrale, well, gosh, she must have been something more than the histrionic shrew Bainbridge makes to bulge, faint, redden, pinch, hit and kick her daughter, her husband, and her friend Johnson by turns.  This was a woman who was wealthy, witty, and a very sought-after hostess and guest-and yet in this novel her life is an unending misery...somehow I tend to think that she was bit more complex than that.  But everything-every scene, every inner thought-is made into a kind of creepy horror for these \\"characters\\"...in this \\"narrative\\", poor Johnson can't even show up from an errand buying treats for his beloved cat, Hodge[a real incident recalled, like much of the basis for this novel, by James Boswell in his \\"Life of Johnson\\"], without this simple act being given new shades of direst import by Bainbridge's pen: the paper bag containing the liver seeps and drips with blood...give me a break.  It's a short book, easily read in one or two sittings.  The author has done research, yes-all of it obvious and based on easily available sources, though not resulting in anything more amazing or unusual than can be found in a standard book on \\"life in Johnson's London\\"(there actually is such a title-and many like it).  Finally, when you decide to write a novel with a couple of real-life geniuses as your main characters, you'd better be at least as witty as they were.  Bainbridge isn't up to that task.very sought-after hostess and guest-and yet in this novel her life is an unending misery...somehow I tend to think that she was bit more complex than that.

I'm giving this 3 stars just for existing.  Actually writing and publishing a book on Carole Lombard, a great comedienne unfortunately best remembered today for being the blonde half of &quot;Gable and Lombard&quot;(if you asked most people under 50 to identify her picture-or conversely, tell you what she looked like, they probably couldn't, unlike Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers or any number of other 1930's greats), gets the author points from me.  Also commendable is the lack of breathless, over-the-top language &quot;movie star&quot; bios are so often filled with, being more &quot;fan fiction&quot; than fact.  Too bad, then, that this book is so slim, as it's unlikely another publisher will put out anything else on her for some time; this one only made it into print on the basis of Lombard's being born in Indiana-and this is apparently one of a proposed series of &quot;Hoosier&quot;-film-related biographies to come.  That said, while the author has done some research, there's not nearly enough here, either biographically or contexually and critically, to justify owning this for any but the most die-hard Lombard fans...of which I'm one.  The photograph selection is particularly sparse and uninspired, criminal when writing about such a beautiful, photogenic woman as Lombard was.<br /> There are almost NO candid shots, there's exactly ONE, often-printed &quot;personal&quot; photo of Lombard when she was 8 years old...many films are passed over, and there are a few glaring mistakes(note to Mr. Gehring: sir,  any casual viewing of Carole's films will show that her famous scar (received in an auto accident in her teens, almost preempting her film career before it started) was on the LEFT, NOT the right side, of her face.  What a weird error for a man to make who claims to have &quot;lived surrounded&quot; by Lombard memorabilia for years!).  In sum, I'm disappointed that this book, which had the chance of being so much more, amounts to a long magazine article rather than a complete and  definitive biography.  The author does, however, have a deep affection for his subject, and does offer a few new insights-a few.<br />My recommendation for best-to-date stories and reflections on this great, great performer would be David Chierichetti's &quot;Mitchell Leisen: Hollywood Director&quot;, an oral history of one of Carole's best directors, who also was an intimate friend of hers.  Go for that one instead. if you must choose.  And certainly check out &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Table&quot;, and &quot;To Be Or Not To Be&quot;, to name a few of her peerless films.complete and  definitive biography.

Considering that Mary Blair is justly famous for her brilliant(in more ways than one)use of color, the reproductions are not good at all.  The text is not only rehashed from Canemaker's much superior &quot;Before the Animation Begins&quot;(which has a chapter on Blair), it's awkwardly shortened here.  As a matter of fact, the book itself-text and pictures-is ridiculously slim, given the sale price, and the fact that this will probably stand as the only book about the subject.<br />As another reviewer mentioned, Mary Blair did much more work than is represented here, particularly her children's illustration.  It's mystifying as to why the author didn't include or couldn't find many, many more worthy examples of Blair's work to include, when in any month on Ebay, one can bid on some eye-popping merchandise(scarves, for one!), magazine illustration, greeting cards-and even original work-that has no representation here.  It appears he merely asked two or three collector friends he knows for permission to publish what they owned, but that's it.  A real shame and a pity.  Still, diehards will have to have it(as I do)on their shelves-but this artist deserved a LOT more than this lazy, slapdash volume.	2003-09-22

A goldmine of comedy relief for these grim times, Al Franken also has some serious issues to address, mainly the myth of a &quot;liberal media&quot;-and when he reminisces about his friend, the late senator Paul Wellstone, he's sincerely poignant-but for the most part, it's enough laughs to carry you all the way to 2004.  Illustrated with facts, footnotes and some mind-bogglingly great first-person anecdotes that expose an awful lot of hypocrisy, cheating and, yes, plain old lying from many prominent pundits and politicians of the right-wing in America.  Some of the chapters are pure parody, such as the brilliantly funny &quot;Supply-side Jesus&quot; piece, done in a Mad-magazine-style comic book format, and &quot;Operation Chickenhawk&quot;, which imagines the scene if all of our most high-ranking republican draft-avoiders, including George Bush, had actually gone to Vietnam.  Franken gives ample evidence of what made him one of the brightest stars of the original Saturday Night Live gaggle of writers.<br />If you've any bent at all either towards the middle, or nudging the left of the so-called political spectrum, it's a must-read.  Enjoy.	2003-09-02

As someone who had no more than a casual interest in this offbeat corner of the showbiz world, I was both delighted and surprised to enjoy &quot;Dummy Days&quot; as much as I did.  It's a beautifully produced book, making it an eyecatcher on the coffee table, but it definitely doesn't stop there: Kelly Asbury is that rare bird, a fan who can write-well.  No mean feat when the subject is one that is outre in the extreme to most of us.  I'm betting you'll wind up being as intrigued as I was with the bios of these very different men and women &quot;vents&quot; (who over 40 doesn't remember &quot;Lampchop&quot;, or Senor Wences-the guy who painted lips on his hand, and somehow made a conversation with &quot;him&quot; totally believable?) and the dummies they played to.

It certainly is.  The author,  Lindsay Anderson, was himself a distinguished director(&quot;O Lucky  Man!&quot;; &quot;If&quot;), a longtime admirer of the films of John  Ford-and a damn fine writer on the subject.  Anderson uses clear and  thoughtful prose and a great, copious selection of stills to illustrate his  take on many Ford movies-from his classics such as &quot;The  Searchers&quot; to less often discussed titles(&quot;They Were  Expendable&quot;; the silents).  Not a dull page in the book(not always the  case with film studies!).  Lots of humor.  Great frankness.  And best of  all, several chapters detailing interviews and encounters Anderson had with  &quot;the old man&quot;-priceless stories that give the reader a real  flavor of Ford-for better or worse.  Reading this book produces two  tremendous urges: first, to watch all the films discussed again; and  second-to make movies.  A classic.	2000-08-02

Lewis wrote seven &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;; while it's hard(and really not necessary)to choose a &quot;best&quot; in the series, this may be it.  &quot;The Horse and his  Boy&quot;(wonderful title)is a rollicking, breathlessly fast-paced  adventure, with each character-both villains and heroes-completely  believable and multi-faceted-especially Bree, the talking war-horse. And if  you're new to C.S. Lewis' work, rest assured his fantasies are as far from  &quot;cute&quot; as you can get; his protagonists always have quite a lot  of tough adventures they have to endure, sometimes in the form of violent  battles(though they never got too violent for an 11 year old at her first  reading). Wonderful language, incredible imagination, characters who become  friends-what more could you want?  I defy any reader to be disappointed.	2000-07-31

Scott Edelstein covers every aspect of the writing life and publishing game that you'd want to know  about, and he does it in a clear and witty fashion.  No patronizing here:  he treats the reader as an equal( a refreshing quality)and as a confidant,  turning a sometimes harsh light on many aspects of working as an author  while also offering many nuggets of help and support.  I don't think you  could be better armed to write and publish than to read this book-unless  you already have a number of professional authors as friends.	2000-07-26

Today it's pretty dog-eared, which reflects how often I've gone  back to it.  It covers just about every aspect of riding one can think  of(the aids, body awareness, feel, creative imagery to help position,  psychology-even proper attire and tack!), and is written clearly and  concisely,  never getting dull or overly technical(wish I could say the  same for some of the others I've shelled out for).  It is also very  reasonably priced-a good &quot;value for money&quot;, as the british say,  which is why I've rated it so highly.

When I read it 30 years  ago, it made me desperate to live in a ramshackle victorian house(great  escapism for urban kids)!

There is narration, sound effects(as when the visual is a windswept moor,  or the sea)-and what I think are two women reading the poems-one being the  author herself, and I think one doing a sort of impression of the  author-though I could be wrong about that!  Also, snippets of interviews  with Plath-fascinating stuff!  There are small portions of &quot;dead  air&quot;, where the camera is panning somewhere or other, and you only  hear ambient sound-but for me that just made for a pleasantly strange audio  experience-appropriate for Plath, perhaps!

US	52639983	R2ASK5T9RKEGS5	0345428188	143369178	Outfoxed	Books	2	4	6	N	N	A disappointment	Rita Mae Brown has a definite talent for description, and she uses it well when the subject matters to her: the joys of cleaning first-rate english tack(horse bridles and saddles); the pride of owning a large rural property  in a place where the land is beautiful, and breeding counts; the careful  nurturing of horses and hounds, and so on. This mystery novel's milieu  springs from the author's real life experience as a Virginia foxhunter and  gentlewoman &quot;farmer&quot;.  Unfortunately and oddly, though, she seems  to lack a feel for real human beings, and her main character has so little  empathy for other homosapiens(as opposed to animals)that it's more than a  little disturbing.  This is a murder mystery where death doesn't really bug  ANYone in a supposedly close-knit, tiny community-not even the young  children of a murder victim(their mother-just widowed by a gruesome murder,  describes her kids as upset, of course-but really more excited than  anything-!).  It's a shame that Brown couldn't have done a non-fiction  essay on the subjects she knows so well, but one suspects the publisher  calls the tune with sales in mind, and mysteries sell.  Brown just can't  plot a good one, with more than one likeable character.  And yes, the  animals &quot;talk&quot; to each other, as in the Sneaky Pie series.  They're just as verbose as the humans, and just barely more likeable.	2000-06-17

Most readers remember Betty MacDonald for her most famous title, &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, or her charming children's series, the Mrs. Piggle-wiggle books.  I had never heard of her when I read &quot;Onions In the Stew&quot; 25 years ago, and now that's it's coming back into print, it deserves  re-discovery.  I defy anyone to get through the first chapter without  laughing out loud.  I'm loathe to describe Mac Donald as &quot;in the Erma  Bombeck mold&quot;-as Betty is MUCH wittier-and also warmer.  &quot;Onions  In the Stew&quot; is thirty-something Betty's account of life during WW2  with one husband, two adolescent daughters, and many, many assorted pets,  neighbors, unwanted guests,et al on an island in Washington's Puget Sound.  No sentimentality, loads of wry observation, and some touching, quite  beautiful descriptions of what was then wild island life.  You'll finish  the book wanting to visit Vashon Island, and feeling like Betty's the best  friend you've never met.	2000-04-20

The british authors have a wonderfully down-to-earth approach, and there is no sense of the &quot;elitism&quot; one sometimes finds in american riding books. Great discussions of common problems, and very helpful solutions offered.  I think it should be in every adult beginner's library.	1998-07-04
