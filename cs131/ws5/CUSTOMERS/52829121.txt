Most books on PDEs either address very basic, introductory concepts or tackle advanced topics requiring Measure theory. In addition, they focus mainly on theoretical concepts and do not provide adequate worked examples. Haberman's text is immensely useful both in bridging the gap between elementary and advanced books as well as in providing many, many completely worked problems. Indeed once you have had a basic course in PDEs you could use this text to teach yourself graduate-level topics such as Green's functions.<br /><br />I do not try to convey the impression that this is a mere cookbook - \\"here's a problem, let's look up the solution\\". To  the contrary. Haberman provides the motivation for each kind of mathematical treatment and interprets his results, pointing out their important consequences. His presentation of Gibbs' phenomenon is the most clear and comprehensive I have yet come across.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book especially to Math and Physics seniors who hope to continue on to graduate school in either of these subjects. In either case, it is expected of you to be adept at Green's functions and Haberman's book lays the groundwork for this topic.	2005-08-22

However, I do not recommend using her advice on all and sundry in your everyday life.<br /><br />First of all, I presume that even the South is not immune from those who are at best, socially inept and at worst, sociopaths. It would bring one a lot of hassle to extricate oneself from misunderstandings arising from charming such people. Many a time I have had the experience of merely interacting in a considerate, polite manner with a man who seems diffident, only to have him mistake my politeness for  ... ahem... personal interest. A warm and personable colleague once had to resort to help from the police when such a man she befriended turned up on her doorstep unannounced and refused to leave.<br /><br />With that caveat in mind, I suggest that you use your good judgement to discern people worthy of your charm. Then, you could use a leaf (or several) from the author's book to bring some sunshine into their lives.<br /><br />I also take issue with the author's credo that charm is a means to an end - to \\"get\\" what you want. This seems manipulative and dishonest to me. I see charm smoothening social interactions and brightening up the day of someone who enhances your life. Surely, if people see that you make everyone feel special, wouldn't that mask your feelings towards those you really value? (If a teacher awards \\"A\\"s to all the students then the grade loses meaning even in the case of those who truly deserve it.)	2005-08-22

The author presents a compelling, well-researched argument that a love of feminine adornment is not at odds with the broadest goal of the feminist movement - that of individual self-expression.<br /><br />Linda Scott tracks the development of the feminist movement in its three stages and analyzes the role of female adornment within the context of each wave of change. She brings to light some atypically flamboyant feminists that other books of this genre neglect to mention. Scott also chronicles the upheavals that concurrently went on in the realms of fashion and women's publications. The interconnection of the topics she deals with is complex and often amorphous, but her lucid analysis makes for thought-provoking reading.	2005-07-13

What happens when the edifice comes tumbling down all around you, making those whom you trusted and who, in turn, placed their trust in you question it all?<br /><br />Finney skims lightly over the issues that are at the core of making his/ her life changing decision. Her blithe writing style makes no effort to capture the horrendous, gut wrenching pain and self-doubt his/her nearest and dearest must have endured when Finney decided to own upto his true inner identity. What makes his/ her narrative so unsympathetic to me is reading that Finney was aware, from a young age that \\"he\\" was meant to be a \\"she\\". Surely, any considerate romantic partner brings this up prior to the nuptials?<br /><br />If any good is to come out of this book, it is hopefully the awareness that someone whom you consider you know, someone otherwise dependable, articulate and professionally successful could harbor such a secret deep within.	2005-06-03

Given her smarts, why didn't this \\"nice girl from a good family\\" fund her education with a scholarship??<br /><br />The author leaves that, and other many questions unanswered. With her high degree of self-awareness (pretty evident in the narrative) the reader is left unfulfilled. Whatever insights we have into her life come across as \\"teasers\\", we catch a glimpse, but do not get the whole story. But that again, is the underlying mindset required of - and fostered by -  her job.<br /><br />Eaves' voice comes across as curiously flat and detached. It is almost as if she is watching herself physically and psychologically from an out-of-the body vantage point. This provokes my curiosity. Does one need to be detached from the sordid aspects of this job all the while faking intimacy, in order to withstand this kind of life?<br /><br />The best aspect of her book is her astute take on the complex web of sexual interaction between men and women. She points out the furtiveness and the hypocrisy  life as either purveyor or supplier of erotic arts entails. She ruminates on the seemingly insatiable male apetite for women's bodies and even after all the experience she has had, still cannot come to grips with this facet of the male psyche. And she lays out the complex dance of deceit both men and women carry out in the exchange of delusion for currency.	2005-05-13

Read it carefully; there ARE some ideas that 21st century women could do well to heed.<br /><br />The whole premise of the book is not to throw yourself - mind, body and soul - to any man who pays you the slightest bit of attention. More generally, do not let neediness and desperation guide your behavior. Value yourself, present yourself in the best light and lead a meaningful life. A woman like this (a \\"creature like any other\\", in the authors' parlance) will be very intriguing to men. Of those who seek your company, carefully select the ones you want to get to know better, observe the level of their interest and gradually enter into a relationship with them. (\\"Love only those who love you.\\")<br /><br />The authors advise the reader to not burden a man with your psychological issues and to not overwhelm him with emotional outpourings. Ironing out personal issues only in the privacy of a therapist's office, holding oneself back in any way are hard pills to swallow in an age of unrestraint and instant gratification. I suspect that this is a theme that draws the wrath of a lot of readers who expect a self-help author to say \\"be yourself, eat/ say/ do whatever you want and he will love you.\\"<br /><br />Along with the exhortions  to look before you leap is the bad (sometimes unethical) advice. The authors advocate pretending to be busy and sought after so that when he eventually does get a hold of you, he will value you that much more. This strategy may work in the beginning. However, after some time wouldn't he catch on to your ruse and realize that your busy social desirability was but a figment of your imagination? It is far healthier to actually have an interesting life than just pretend to have one. The controversial advice to not return 'phone calls would weed off all but the borderline stalkers. Returning them without being over-eager and desperate for attention would, I believe, be better advice.<br /><br />The best way to profit from the book is to see the spirit of self-protection in which the advice is given and figure out a way to (ethically) incorporate The Rules into your life. Take the good in a proper spirit and toss out the questionable. There's a good mix of both in the book and if you read it thoughtfully, it's easy to separate the wheat from the chaff., I believe, be better advice.

This presumes a certain amount of subjective judgement. Sure, several of the trees depicted here are certified world record holders - the oldest, tallest, etc. In a sense, encountering their pictures in a book like this is not a surprise. The real treat here is to have Packenham direct our attention to lesser-known trees that are spectacular in an unexpected way. Some bespeak a magnificent history, weathering storms and human intervention (not always benevolent) over centuries. They have overcome obstacles, and have lived to tell the tale. Others have grown to be extremely unusual examples of their kind, sometimes when transplanted from their indigenous surroundings. Included also are photos of outstanding examples  of ginkgos and baobabs etc. which as a species, look grotesque in comparison with more elegant, controlled trees that one normally sees.<br /><br />As other reviewers have remarked, the layout of the book is superb. Packenham has managed to capture not only the majesty of the individual trees but the spirit of each locale. Some scenarios are bright, friendly and welcoming. Many are not; the trees cast an eerie sense of forboding, still evoking an aura of dark deeds committed in their precints.<br /><br />This is a treat for a nature afficianado. It also makes a great compendium of freakishness, a great hostess gift for Halloween, or for a friend whose tastes lean towards the macabre.	2005-05-09

This is a compendium of advice that anyone who is somewhat socially attuned would surely pick up by their 30th yr on Earth!<br /><br />Most of the advice is a variation on the following themes.<br /><br />* Be courteous and considerate (if you are getting late for a date, call them up and keep them informed).<br /><br />* Maximize your physical attributes. Be clean and well-groomed.<br /><br />* Don't treat your date as a therapist. Tell her/him a few pleasant but not boastful things about yourself and display interest in her/him.<br /><br />* Be enthusiastic with your words and body language, but don't be overeager.<br /><br />* Don't hit on others while you are on a date. Don't give false hope. Discuss pregnancy and STDs before you get intimate.<br /><br />Well... not exactly the \\"secrets\\" of great seducers.<br /><br />I found only two pieces of advice here that do not appear in a standard etiquette book. One is to be relaxed and receptive to your date (as tension leftover from even a bad day in the office may come across as hostile to someone you are getting to know). The other secret of seduction is to be subtly sensual with props e.g. \\"absently\\" caressing tableware, items of clothing, etc. to make your date aware that you are a tactile person.	2005-05-08

Finally, unable to bear the brunt of a secret (revealed at the end of the book), she decided to leave her husband at the apex of his recognition.<br /><br />Her flat narrative tinged with a bitter wit, bespeaks a sharp and observant mind. She recalls the struggle in the early women's lib days, of bright women to be heard and taken seriously. She also brings across the exhaustion of raising and tending to a family, and the toll it takes on one's creative spirit.<br /><br />The end came too abruptly for me. I felt that the narrative could have been fleshed out a bit more. Or was the author trying to convey the \\"last straw\\" mindset of her protagonist?	2005-05-05

The unspoken assumptions which held up pretty well even 15 yrs ago are no longer valid quite as often. For example at the turn of the millenium, one cannot assume the boss is a married USA-born Caucasian male. In most workplaces and social groups not everyone has the same lifestyle or skin color or religious beliefs. In the midst of this diversity how DO you keep a one-size-fits all guide to the social skirmishes that inevitably plays fair by everyone, with grace and tact?<br /><br />In this book the author handles the usual etiquette intricacies of silverware placement and Thank You notes. In addition, she bravely treads new grounds in terms of how to socially interact with cohabiting couples of any gender combination. She deals with the U.N. negotiations level complexities of inviting multiply married parents (plus current partners) to the wedding of their common offspring.<br /><br />Yes, Miss Manners gives great advice with wit and insight ... and it makes great food for thought. But some of her suggestions do not seem practical. Can a 22 yr-old really get away with raising her eyebrows and not answering a question posed to her by someone several decades older? Methinks not. That would seem an etiquette breach in itself.	2005-05-03

After you've read a few and seen all the twists and turns which inevitable end up with Prince Charming sweeping the blissful heroine into the land of wedded delight, here comes chick-lit with an international flavor.<br /><br />The story is one familiar to many young women who are not only confounded with the perils and pitfalls of romance, but who also needs to negotiate balancing life in pretty dissimilar cultures. Thumbing her nose at Rudyard Kipling (\\"East is East and West is West, never the twain shall meet\\") Anju, Daswani's heroine, manage to juggle the demands of modern life together with leading a cross-cultural lifestyle. Hers are the concerns of many young Asians who study and work in USA and Europe. On one hand she feels compelled to appeal the family elders who fret that she has become too Westernized (read unmarriageable). On the other hand the lures of a freer lifestyle and fitting in with friends from her new life becon with their own siren call.<br /><br />Anju is likeable and real. The humiliating encounters with eminently unsuitable men while the desirable ones stay out of reach is something to which young women of all cutures can relate. The cast of characters in the form of a well-meaning family that do not  have the Western concept of \\"personal space\\" rings very true to those with close ties to the cultures of S.Asia. Many of the insider jokes, malapropisms and cultural terminology would be lost on the readers not familiar with these settings. A glossary of terms would have been helpful to this end.<br /><br />I feel that the finale of the books was rushed. Hence my four star ranking. It gives the impression that the right guy appeared out of thin air. If this portion of the narrative could have been fleshed out a bit, it would definitely make the story sound more belivable.	2005-04-26

The protagonist is smart, insightful and answers to a strong moral code. She is also lonely and self-aware. A precocious college graduate (Philosophy), her mental development is far ahead of her under-utilized emotional one and she struggles to navigate the world around her with principles intact. She makes slow progress until an unexpected encounter of the male kind poses a conundrum. For the first time in her life she is torn between dictates of her head and heart, putting her deeply held beliefs to test.<br /><br />The storyline and her internal dialog are a few quantum leaps ahead of the banal concerns found in many chick-lit books. However, the constant refrains to Carrie's \\"genius\\" are truly grating. Her intellectual gifts are not to be sneezed at, but she falls far short of the genius or prodigy tag.  I think the latter should be reserved for those who possess spectacular talents; 12 yr old concert pianists and kids who start on graduate  Math at 14, for example.<br /><br />It is also difficult to fathom how Carrie became so isolated from her peers even after attending Harvard.  Surely her calibre of intellect is not an extremely rare commodity at an elite college? She could have joined some special-interest clubs, met fellow brainiacs and gotten to know their friends, in turn.<br /><br />These few implausibilities aside, this is a genre worth emulating. Hopefully \\"Carrie Pilby\\" will provide  validation to some bright young women and keep their talents from losing out to the mindless culture at large.	2005-04-21

A brilliant and shy young scholar from a conservative S.Indian family wins a scholarship to study Physics at Cambridge. He spends the few weeks at sea en route to England working on the Physics of stellar collapse.  His results puzzle even the eminent theorists of his day, Eddington among them. Undaunted by his detractors, trying to adapt to an alien culture with its cold winters and bland, non-vegetarian cuisine, the young scientist plugs on convinced that his calculations are correct. Eventually, the much older Chandrasekhar gains international renown for his work and is honored with the Nobel Prize for Physics.<br /><br />The book is, overall, a chronicle of a great man's journey. He gains in stature and experience, but his fundamental character remains the same. Over and over we are given the same impression of Dr.Chandrasekhar by those who knew him as  family, friend and/ or colleague. He is portrayed as dedicated to his work, dignified, disciplined in all aspects of his life, holding himself and the others around him to the utmost high standards.<br /><br />The books is more about the man, than about his work. Of course, his life cannot be portrayed without referencing his work. Wali frequently alludes to it but only as a backdrop to the various stages and incidents of the scientist's life. Wali's goal is to capture the essence of the man, and he has done so admirably.	2005-04-20

It is written from the unusual perspective of a published author who also works in a bookstore.<br /><br />The tone of the book is meandering, similar in spirit to the turns taken by the mind of someone browsing around in a bookstore. At times she reminisces about her life, a certain title may send her train of thought on a philosophical tangent, but somehow she ends up weaving her thread back into the complex tapestry of her narrative.<br /><br />Overall the book is enlightening and deeply humane. It warms the heart of a bibliophile to know that there are many who share one's fascination with books, devoting their energies to writing, publishing, caring for and selling books and also for passing on this enthusiasm to children. However, Shea's tendency to go on and on about the diversity of topics one finds in a bookstore easily becomes tiresome.

It did not. The author has expended a great deal of effort into capturing the essence of a woman who single-handedly revolutionized the concept of fashion magazines.<br /><br />The book simultaneously chronicles the events in Ms. Vreeland's life among the international glamor set and showcases her astounding professional achievements. Dwight's prose is so evocative that we feel that we are in the Vogue office or at a fashion shoot, while Ms Vreeland makes her trademark dramatic pronouncements with theatrical gestures. As madcap as her ideas seemed, they captured the imagination of the fashionistas and people in the industry, sky-rocketing  sales of the avant garde Vogue (previously a staid, niche publication).<br /><br />Ms.Vreeland comes across as someone who approached everything she did with wholehearted passion. Shown in the book are photographs of Ms.Vreeland with her suavely attired husband and sons, with friends, models and designers. In every photograph we see her totally in the moment, a larger-than-life but also very human diva. She was a genuine original, a woman of extraordinary talent and vision.

It can be unobstrusively carried in your purse so that you can have a quiet read in the midst of your chaotic day and be transported to Mme. Dariaux's world of grace and elegance.<br /><br />In droll, wise prose  the author lists many aspects of elegance in alphabetical order. She covers the basics of carefully and optimally selecting fabrics, clothing  staples and accessories to build an  wardrobe that will carry you through different occasions. As the book was originally written in the '60's this advice needs to be adhered to in spirit and modified to fit  modern women who in general have more complex lives.<br /><br /> Mme.Dariaux does not limit her attention to the selection and care of attire. Scattered throughout the book are thoughfully presented  tips that helps one carry over a mantle of elegance to other areas of one's life.

One:  beauty has a profound effect on our lives. Two: humans are hardwired in the way that we recognize and react to beauty. She merges findings from scientific studies with quotations from philosophers, playwrites, artists and literary giants to lend credence to her premises. Her exposition is lucid and compelling, which makes the book a fascinating read rather than a tedious academic treatise (which it could have been). Her themes gracefully weave through many aspects and expressions of the human experience yet in the end zoom in on her target point.<br /><br />However, I share the view of several other Amazon reviewers that the author does not delve deeply into cultural ideals of beauty. She does not address well known beauty practices that may seem strange, even grotesque to those who are mired in Western aesthetic ideals. I would have loved to see her perception of, for example, the \\"giraffe necked women\\" of Myanmar and the extreme elongation of lips and earlobes considered a beauty ideal in some African cultures.	2005-04-07

Matalin's advice is humorous and humane. It is a compendium of her life lessons as well as maternal advice handed down through the generations in her family. Contrary to what some may expect from the author, the book is no doctrinaire tome espousing a particular political philosophy, but the advice of a warm and wise mother.<br /><br />Matalin covers all topics of interest to young girls (and their moms) including friendship, academic issues, self esteem,  dealing with mean girls and relating to boys. She is firm in her convictions without being overbearing or patronizing. She comes across empathic to teenage sentiments and concerns without advocating the \\"do whatever feels good\\" party line of many a parent who thinks themselves au courant. I have observed that teenagers (with their unsure sense of self) actually appreciate behavior guidelines from their parents but can easily become resentful when the strictures are too harsh. Admittedly, this is a delicate balance to achieve and Matalin does an admirable job of walking the tightrope.	2005-03-29

However, it could be seen in a useful context even if you are the type who would not use these tactics on someone else. One, it helps you spot those who are manipulating you. Two, if you are generally interested in human behavior, you can glean a lot of fascinating information into the modus operadii (as interpreted by the authors) of certain public figures.<br /><br />The book is not a light read. Much effort has gone into putting this tome together. There are plenty of historical anecdotes and sidebars within which rend the book of interest purely from the viewpoint of the historian or classical scholar. A person with the latter type of interests studies the lives of dictators and analyzes their tactics. But this knowledge does not convert all historians into control freaks. In the same vein, reading this treatise on the type of behavior some people employ need not turn you into a manipulator. However, considering its potential for harm, I would recommend that readers be in a secure place in their lives before perusing this book.

Were all Math books  written like this, the number of students majoring in Math, Physics, etc. would rise considerably. The presentation is clear, lucid and comprehensive. Each concept is introduced with its motivating phenomena and the mathematical  treatment is logical and elegant with many worked examples. This is one of those rare Math books that \\"begin at the beginning\\", yet go on to develop the concepts to a point useful even to grad students who want a review of basics before plunging into more advanced material. (If you are looking for more detailed mathematical stuff, I'd suggest Kevorkian's \\"Multiple Scale and Singular Perturbation Methods\\" or \\"Perturbation Methods\\" by Hinch.)<br /><br />For the benefit of those reviewers who have complained that the mathematics is not rigorous enough, may I point out that the author clearly states  the book is an introduction to the topic. I have come across other introductory books using basic differential equations, on similar topics where the material is presented  in a disjointed way. Strogatz, however, shows us the inter-relatedness of the broad range of concepts and applications that fall within the title. Therein lies a major strength of this book.<br /><br />Another big plus is that Strogatz presents those intermediate diagrams and results that take us to the final conclusion. Also he interprets the Math en route to the finale. He does not employ the usual \\"it is apparent that ...\\" strategy to pole-vault to miracle steps. This approach makes the book a breezy read; a remark not commonly made about advanced Math books!	2005-03-28

An an avid reader who favors no particular genre or author, I'm always on the lookout for good book recommendations. With my eclectic  tastes, finding a rare treasure such as \\"Book Lust\\" is a treat.

She eschews the dry \\"European History\\", \\"Genetics\\" mode of classification for the more emotionally resonant \\"Czech Authors\\", \\"Three Hanky Reads\\" etc. etc.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more books about science and scientists.

HGB's cult classic is charmingly written (without her trademark overuse of italics, thank goodness!) and contains some good advice ... mixed in with the bad.<br /><br />She exhorts single women to be prudent with their money, glam up their looks and to have an exciting social circle. All this is in addition to giving advice on when, where and how to meet attractive, successful men. Plus she gives some great recipes for entertaining. Read closely and you'll get some wonderful tips!<br /><br />On the OTHER hand, she's quite cavalier about the ethics of dating married men and of having affairs with your coworkers even at the risk of endangering one's job. OK, so we can't legislate or dicatate our feelings. However, blatently encouraging such disruptive behavior is another issue altogether. In  today's litigious climate I find this counsel questionable, especially to young, naive college grads who look up to Cosmo as \\"The Bible\\".	2005-03-19

Not all were born wealthy, not all were pretty but each of these women had an inner spirit and an outstanding sense of style that caught the eyes of the public (and of wealthy, influential men).<br /><br />It is interesting to see how each woman expressed her individual fashion sense within the very narrow sartorial dictates of her era. Their collective appeal lies in managing to balance conformity with originality to come up with a signature style that transcends time. Yes, they had access to great coutouriers, jewelers and stylists. But so did other women of their wealth and social rank who did not create a similar aesthetic legacy.<br /><br />What can we learn from them? One, that a woman need not resort to tasteless skin exposure to make a fashion statement. Two, a conservative dress code can be maintained without being bland and forgettable. The third (and I think the most important) lesson is that you need not be dazzlingly gorgeous to create a lovely sense of style that makes the most of your assets.	2005-03-15

Being such a SATC fan, I gave in and made the purchase. It was a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />* The book contains interviews with the main characters; the four actresses, their leading men as well as Stanford, Anthony and Bunny. Main members of the production team also get their say, and there are  several action shots of the production process.<br /><br />* There are lots of photos of outfits worn by the four ladies. This is your chance to check out the fashion details!<br /><br />* There is a double page spread of the guys (and the few women) who were romantic prospects for each of the leading ladies. If you look closely you see one or two guys who may be \\"repeats\\" (came as two different characters in two widely spaced episodes). I notice one omission, though. It was the preppy blond guy who walked in on Bunny confronting Charlotte in the living room. (Bunny remarked \\"you are missing a pair of pants, young man.\\")<br /><br />* There is a map of the restaurants and other places were many of the on-location episodes were filmed.<br /><br />Why only four stars? There are no details about part two of season six. If Sohn had waited until the end of the entire series, this book would have been a more complete wrap-up.	2005-03-15

If you are looking for a quick fix, this book is not for you. The advice given in the book does not come across as some kind of divine revelation. The author focuses on a few commonsense behavior modifications that in the long run, help towards cutting down high-caloric overindulgence.<br /><br />This book is charmingly written. I consider that its main virtue. The author writes with humor and makes witty observations. (She comments that the preservatives listed on many processed food seem like weapons grade chemicals!) I see her personal anecdotes as putting her lifestyle advice in context, not as any kind of self-aggrandizement, as several reviewers seem to think. Indeed, what she focuses on is a steady lifestyle overhaul of both behavior and attitudes. Illustrating this concept with concrete examples, culled from her own life and observations, seems to me a reasonable means towards realizing this goal.<br /><br />A few more recipes and specific examples of food choices for the 3 main meals and as snacks would have made this book more user friendly. I suggest that the next edition come with color photos (not just to add visual variety to the book but also to showcase French portion sizes).	2005-03-08

She keeps to her trademark humor and perceptiveness while using very \\"everyday\\" situations. To those who complain that the cartoon plays upon stereotypical female concerns such as shopping and food, I counter that these themes make the humor relatable to many women, while providing a backdrop to the cartoonist's witty and incisive social commentary.<br /><br />This particular collection  plays upon an unexpected twist in the Cathy-Irving saga. After a lapse of three years, Irving turns up in a very unexpected way in Cathy's life - her professional life! - as a downsizing consultant. Guisewite very cleverly develops various angles of this theme, such as the often seen discrepancy between a person's competent \\"together\\" professional demeanor versus the more lackadaisical, sometimes inept, personal one. The irony is heightened for instance when Cathy's boss introduces Irving as being hired to do some housecleaning (as he euphemistically calls it) for the company and Cathy remembers that he does not even pick up his towels off the floor!<br /><br />Of course Guisewite weaves in her usual themes into the plot. The title itself stems from a realization that her cartoon protagonist looks fabulous with the aid of the usual flesh constricting sartorial arsenal of corsets, tight hose and stillettos, etc.  It speaks to the inventiveness and imagination of Guisewite that she can bring up many fresh and astute takes on these seemingly mundane aspects of the female experience.	2005-03-03

Patrick Smith gives careful consideration to many types of questions that flee through one's mind while aboard a commercial airplane. From the dumb (will those wings fall off?)to the insightful (do all planes carry enough fuel to circle round for a long time before landing?) to the unusual (how do gay pilots cope in a macho aviation culture?) Smith tackles questions and concerns with wit and aplomb, giving hard data where necessary to back up his case.<br /><br />The biggest plus about this book is that the author presents his information with clarity and humor. He includes enough detail to educate the reader without overwhelming him/her. Even with my training in Physics, I was satisfied with his presentation of Bernoulli's principle (that keeps airplanes aloft). It was precise, concise and very comprehensible.<br /><br /> As can be expected, Smith delves into the technicalities of aircraft construction, pilot training and airport security. In addition, he touches on some topics which I'd assumed to be of not much significance to a pilot. Most notable among them is his lovingly nuanced coverage of airline logos. He notes, for instance, that the logo colors of an airline needs to be geographically evocative of the region it represents. A few color photographs would have really driven home his point here.<br /><br />Smith also brings a multi-cultural perspective to his writing. He generously accords merit where he sees fit, even though the airline (or airport) is from a country that carries little cultural or economic cachet in the Western world. However, he is forthright in pointing out cultural factors that seem to have led to serious airplane accidents. He cites, for example, a crash that occurred because pilots from a stereotypically macho culture did not heed the electronic warning relayed in a female voice.<br /><br />Part aviator, part writer, artist and voice of reason, Smith brings a panoramic perspective to a complex topic. Highly recommended, in particular as a gift for those \\"hard to buy for\\" friends.cular as a gift for those \\"hard to buy for\\" friends.	2004-12-30

This series of books has gotten some bad press for advocating behavior strategies that could be interpreted as manipulative. Some of the tactics seem questionable (hence the 4 stars and not 5). However, if you go beyond the specifics and see The Rules in context I think that the authors' advice seems more palatable and appropriate.<br /><br />I think that the core readership the authors want to appeal to are those women who give of their time, energy, bodies and souls too soon and too freely, only to get hurt. Some of these women behave this way primarily out of neediness. The \\"get a life, develop some hobbies, make time for your friends\\" advice is targeted at such women. There is an additional not-so-obvious target group for these books.  The large contingent of smart women who extend the \\"go for it\\" approach that has served them well in other areas of their lives to convince a man to fall in love with them, can also save themselves a great deal of hair-pulling by heeding Fein and Schneider.<br /><br />It seems to me that the authors are trying to get across the message that you cannot coerce someone to fall in love with you. You need to take things slow and wait for signs of definite interest before investing your precious self in a relationship with him. Rules II outlines the specifics you need to look for and be aware of before you make any kind of committment to a potential significant other.<br /><br />Now an obvious question arises from this credo. What if HE too takes the responsive role in a relationship? The Rules authors counter this argument in the first book proclaiming that men who wait for the woman to take the first move continue this trend into the relationship. After reading The Rules books, I too have observed this. Fein and Schneider are very upfront about not having being trained in therapy; their book is purely based on anecdotal evidence. This commonsense (grandma?) psychology is surprisingly effective once you understand the spirit of what the authors are trying to convey and not get bogged down in their sometimes questionable tactics.o convey and not get bogged down in their sometimes questionable tactics.	2004-11-24

The message is as patently simple as \\"if you want to lose weight, consume less calories and exercise more\\". So why bother to read this book if its message can be summed in a sentence? It's because we (smart women ;)) keep on thinking that OUR case is different and Behrendt shows us in his tough love approach that no, we are deluding ourselves. To drive his points home he explicitly gives us examples of instances when we are apt to cook up a \\"yes, but...\\" excuse and jolts us to back to reality.<br /><br />Thinking back on all the times I made excuses for my exes, I wish someone pointed out the obvious to me. Sometimes (especially when our judgement is clouded by insecurity) we DO need someone to point out the obvious and Behrendt does so in no uncertain terms.<br /><br />The role of Liz Tuccillo is not v. clear to me in this book but her commentary sound very familiar to most women.<br /><br />***************************************************************<br />Allow me to add a comment from my own experiences (hope Behrendt and Tuccillo are listening ;))<br /><br />If a guy goes on and on about how \\"nice\\" you are ... uhmmm ... that's a sign that he sees you as a therapist, not as a dreamgirl. He'll proceed to use you as a sounding board to discuss all the women he treated like princesses and who eventually broke his heart. If he's really all that into you, he should be treating YOU like a princess, not like a therapist.	2004-11-12

An urban sophisticate could use this book to add that extra veneer of sparkle to his already glossed self and get a good chuckle out of the witty prose, as well. However, the vast majority of hot-dog chomping guys would (I presume) still emerge clueless after perusing this book.<br /><br />The authors give absolutely no guidance on how to approach a woman in real life. The internet dating advice on this issue, however, is a little more fleshed out with specifics. The would-be-carouser is also not advised how to behave on those all important, impression forming initial dates. I'm a female and I'm utterly amazed (and often appalled) just by the way many otherwise well-meaning, honorable, smart professional men relate to women. Advice such as not treating a date as a therapist, taking some genuine interest in her life, maintaining proper grooming and hygiene in an intimate relationship are definite romance-builders. These topics of paramount importance do not come up in the book except as cursory references to other issues. In addition, The .. ahem ... end \\"bars\\" theme comes across as overworked especially as the authors have used a similar motif in their previous tome.<br /><br />All in all, I wish that Mollod and Tesauro had gone one step back on the evolutionary scale and given the nitty-gritty (with specific examples) on how to have a pleasant social interaction with a woman. Even \\"Modern Gentleman\\" does not cover these crucial fundamentals but assumes a more sophisticated patina in its readers, that is sadly lacking in the real world. Once these skills are thoroughly mastered the stage is set for romance and the gentleman reader is primed for the kind of advice given in this book.	2004-11-04

Anyone who reads this book in the hope of cultivating an individualized sense of style will not find much helpful information.<br /><br />The book is amusingly written; the authors eloquently describe the adrenaline high of finding a jazzy item. But the text and photos do not convey that the individual items they rave about fit into any coherent style. In fact several outfits pictured in the book look very amateurish and the T-shirt slashing gimmicks come across like a rainy-day project for 8th grade girls.<br /><br />The photos (and descriptions) of the girls' mothers, however, tell a different story. These ladies really seem to have an eye for glamour! I wish that the two moms had written a book on style.	2004-10-07

I started browsing through this book this lazy Sunday morning at a bookstore and ended up reading it cover to cover. I was so absorbed in the book that when I got up from the comfy coffee shop chair one of my legs was numb!<br /><br />This book is NOT one of those artsy tomes that tell you what you already know, (and that, too, in 2nd grade font) and have lots of glossy pics of no relevance to most people's lives. Kressley has style - loads of it - and delivers his very pragmatic advice with delightful wit.<br /><br />As one of the reviewers mentioned, this is NOT about dressing like Carson. A straight man following the author's advice does not have to be apprehensive about giving off misguiding vibes about his sexual orientation. When Kressley mentions manicures he expressly notes that polish is not a mandatory part of the procedure. When it comes to eyebrow grooming he hastens to mention that the plucking should still leave brows looking manly. (He compares unibrows to the migration path Bering Strait!)<br /><br />Before I write any further, let me reveal that I'm a hetero female. Foppish aesthetics don't appeal to me; I like a GQ/ Brooks Brothers vibe. On the other hand a prissy, bland and unimaginatively dressed man conveys to me that he's rigid and humorless (the sort that turns into ... ummmm ... some of the more extreme Republicans in their old age). Also a man that appears so vain and self-absorbed that I can well imagine him arranging his hair just so in front of the mirror while his neighbor's house is on fire, is also not an appealing idea to me. From conversations with many women friends, I presume that many females are in agreement with me. Admittedly, maintaining such an aesthetic is a delicate balancing act. Kressley does an admirable job of navigating this terrain while allowing for the dictates of individual lifestyles and budgets.<br /><br />All in all, Kressley's advice is very doable, workable and affordable. In a cultural climate of \\"anything goes\\" this advice of personalized style, gets down to its point very agreeably.d style, gets down to its point very agreeably.	2004-10-03

Pure curiosity motivated me to glimpse at what \\"the other team\\" was getting. Hence the purchase of this not-so-little book.<br /> I had expected the authors to stick to the obvious tenets of Gentlemen's Finishing School 101: regularly trim burgeoning nasal (and other personal) topiary, attend to itches IN PRIVATE, maintain eye contact with a lady's face, etc. I was fascinated and charmed to see the authors swashbuckle their way across a much wider swath of territory. The thoughtful advice proffered includes not pressuring a pregnant girlfriend for intimacy (or to take a particular course of action regarding the pregnancy) and refraining from ogling a dancer performing at an adjacent table in a \\"gentleman's club\\" without making a payment. (Truth be told, I had never, ever, realized that this type of establishment called for such enlightened etiquette. Then again, my venues of entertainment happen to be concert halls, but more of that later on in this review.) The authors also advise a best man to calm down the groom beset by pre-wedding jitters and to handle the latter's wallet for gratuities and checks. A truly considerate touch!<br /><br />  A part of a lifestyle guide is to navigate the delicate balance between honoring one's authentic self while developing grace and savoir-faire. In this regard, I was really irked to see the readers being advised to fake an interest in classical music. To quote directly from the source; \\"Below are eight must -haves that, like answers to $800 and $1000 Jeopardy questions will show off your musical breadth.\\" Investigating new cultural avenues is laudable. However, faking an interest to impress others is deplorably sophomoric.<br />  In the same vein, cutting through the thicket of excessive verbiage in the book is exhausting. Isn't clobberring others with one's erudition at odds with projecting a subtly sophisticated aura of \\"to the manner born\\"? I always had the impression that trying too hard was the most distinctive mark of the poseur.<br />  Now for the downright questionable advice. The authors devote far too much space to the topic of alcoholic libations. The sub topics covered on this matter even include the machinations of transporting it in a flask (to be secretly sipped, for instance, at the house of a girlfriend's stuffy parents). The authors also blithely encourage lying to a lover about the number of previous sexual partners.<br />  The book has potential to be a great graduation gift to a young man ... once the authors and their editors take some quiet hours (minus their flasks) to re-think their ideals and to rewrite the book in a more accessible lingo.ura of \\"to the manner born\\"?

Unfortunately I am pretty disillusioned by men (seen too many weirdos in my field!) and also by most fiction written for women (too wordy and/or banal). However, I  was so riveted by this wonderful book that I played hooky from the lab for  an entire day to stay home and read it. I could write a lot about the  quirky heroine and her sweetly irreverent cousin Dodie, but the book is  worth reading mainly because of the character of Eben Strauss. He's  definitely on the endangered species list - gentle, moral, considerate,  loving as well as professionally successful. I am not ashamed to say that I  was touched to the point of tears. (for the record, &quot;The Bridges of  Madison County&quot; didn't have the same effect on me.) Although the  author has drawn upon several stereotypes, the clever dialog paints the  characters as eminently REAL, 3-D people. Hope to see more books by the  author.	1999-06-12
