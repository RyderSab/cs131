The author traces back eleven years to when the accident occurred, and then develops the reasons why the death could have been premeditated murder.  While he is dealing with this murder mystery, Hillerman also develops the characters, so that you feel the sorrow of the widower, the retired Leaphorn, and then understand the anxiety of Acting Lt. Jim Chee as he deals with hard choices of his once and future fianc&eacute; (who wants a citified life while Jim wants a Navajo life).  I think that Mr. Hillerman develops the Navajo characters better than the white characters, who, really, are just bit-players in the drama being presented.  Interestingly, I think that the author truly has presented a romance novel on three levels: the lost love of the widower, Leaphorn; the mixed-up choices of Lt. Chee and the love story of Hal Breedlove and his wife (who remains true to him as a widow for eleven years).<br /><br />I found this book to be well written and to contain a wealth of information on the Four Corners regions of the United States.  All the distance mistakes, etc.,  that the other reviewers alluded to are hard to discover if you are listening to the book on tape and can not easily refer back to different pages.  This book helped me in the traffic, on the trip back and forth, from Plymouth, Massachusetts to Quincy, Massachusetts.	2005-08-26

Sub-titled: \\"One Woman's Story Of Word War II. Southfarm Press, Middletown, Connecticut.1996.<br /><br />This book was originally published in Norwegian in 1946, directly after the events of the Second World War. This is a recent translation and publication in English. The author had suffered at the hands of the Nazis in Norway, when she was captured as part of the underground resistance.  The first 183 pages of this book recounts the author's capture, her imprisonment, her beatings and sufferings ... for years, all in a prison in Norway.  Then, the book ends at the time when she was transferred into Germany and later to camps in Austria.  There are some ten pages, at the back of the book,  which recount the rest of her captivity, and her final release into freedom.  I just wish that she had presented the entire story in one volume.  Splitting the story into two volumes made the work in the first volume \\"incomplete\\".	2005-08-25

Subtitled \\"From Nazi Tyranny To Japanese Terror\\". University of Illinois Press, 2003.<br /><br />This is a collection of intriguing stories, documenting the escape of many different Jewish people, families  and individuals,  from the impending Holocaust in Nazi dominated Europe.  One of the escapees is the author, Frank Ephraim, who has done a great deal of research on how and when the individual escapees reached Manila, The Philippines, and their fate when the Japanese were forced out.<br /><br />Each of the intriguing stories has its own chronology: some Jews escaped in the early 1930s, when the promulgation of the Nuremberg  Laws painted a dark picture of their future, while others did not leave until the September 1st 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland.  These necessarily different chronologies can be confusing as you read this interesting book.  Further, the author insists giving the date of the Pearl Harbor attack as December 8th, I.e. Manila time, as the Philippines are on the other side of the International Dateline.  Of particular interest to me was the story of the young man who flew from Europe to the ends of Asia  (Shanghai) in a German JU52.  He was the only passenger.  That kind of trip was rare enough at that time, but for a Jew who was escaping it was audacious.  Further, the author completes the story, through enough research, to track down what happened to that aircraft after Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />The author's research has some flaws, however.  On page 73 he mentions the Catholic De La Salle College\\", which he attended on Taft Avenue in Manila.  He states that the College was staffed by \\"... Jesuit brothers\\".  This is in error.  De La Salle College was begun and staffed by the Christian Brothers De La Salle, an order of teaching brothers begun by St. John Baptist De La Salle(1651-1719) in Reims, France.  The Jesuits do have brothers, but they were begun by St. Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556).  When I checked the notes in the back of the book, the reference to the college and the Jesuits brothers was based upon \\"personal recollection\\".  In my Historiography classes, my professor warned me against depending solely on  personal recollection or personal memory. So, I went to the web site for De La Salle College (now University) and that confirmed that it was the Christian Brothers De La Salle.  By the way, the Japanese massacred fifteen of the Brothers in the last days of the occupation.  As a graduate of Manhattan  College, begun by the Christian Brothers De La Sale in 1853, I am, perhaps, oversensitive to any slight, intended or unintended,  to them.ed the notes in the back of the book, the reference to the college and the Jesuits brothers was based upon \\"personal recollection\\".

Extra Special Personal Memoir.<br /><br />\\"Visions From A Foxhole\\" by William A. Foley, Jr.  Subtitled \\"A rifleman In Patton's Ghost Corps\\". Ballantine Books, NY 2003.<br /><br />This is the story of a young man, seeking to find himself, while at the same time he is defending his country.  His father had served in world War I, and William A. Foley, Jr., is not only learning about himself during his time in the European Theatre of Operations but also about his father's experience in the First World War.  Foley, Jr., as a lower ranking soldier,  is part of the 94th Infantry Division which went through some heavy fighting,  for example,  in the Ruhr, crossing the Saar River and then crossing the Rhine River.  His written personal recollections are made all the more vivid by his drawings.<br /><br />Almost for relief, Foley had begun to draw, in pencil on paper,  the scenes of war, as he experienced them  He realized  that he had more talent than most people, so he began to accumulate and protect his drawings from action to action, town to town, river to river.  Despite dunkings in rivers, shellings, winter weather and so much more, the author saved most of his drawings and presented a selection in this book. These contemporary drawings  confirm the harshness of the battle. The drawings combined with his written words makes this an extra special personal memoir. The author also has a web site, tied in with the title of the book.<br /><br />Just as an aside, my Professor in Historiography once stated that  \\"Spell checker\\" has ruined many an editor.  On page 139, the book states that  the author \\"...sneaked a peak {sic}\\"... while in other pages of the book, he was sneaking a \\"peek\\", the proper spelling for looking discretely.  On page 209, the Greek letter \\"Pi\\" appears before the date \\"16 March\\".  Spell Checker ignores Greek Letters.

Fritz.  S<br /><br />ub-titled, \\"Soldiers, civilians And The Death Of the Third Reich\\", University press of Kentucky, 2004.<br /><br />This is a well-documented record of the last months of the war in Europe, 1945, with an emphasis on the American drive through the south of Germany, into Austria. I say well-documented because, for example, Professor Fritz has devoted pages 276 through 332 on end notes on the subject matter.  The author may have overdone it for some readers, because he has almost as many pages of notes as he does have text.  This would, however, make my MA thesis advisor happy. Along the same scholarly theme, the book contains some 22 pages of primary sources (pp. 331-352) and some 23 pages of secondary sources (pp. 353-369).<br /><br />Despite these scholarly overtones, Stephen G. Fritz has a written an excellent history of the final chapters of the war, the \\"end struggle\\".<br /><br />Contemporary generals (e.g. Eisenhower and Bradley) were quite concerned with the so-called \\"Werwulf\\" -Werewolf- groups who were supposed to act as guerrilla  units and continue hostilities even though the Wehrmacht had surrendered.  Looking back over the past 60 years, we know that this guerilla army was an empty threat.  The author, however, spends a lot of time on the this threat, that never materialized.  He gives both  the high command's ideas of what was happening in the south of Germany, but also presents the \\"grunt's\\" view of the end struggle.  For example, he clearly shows that the American Army would not tolerate any last ditch defense.  If the Hitler Youth or the SS chose to defend a town or village to the last civilian, the Americans would sit back, call in artillery and the USAAF and literally destroy the location.  Mr. Fritz documents incidents where the German civilian population wanted to surrender, but the die-hard units (e.g. SS units) wanted to fight to the bitter end.  This resulted in some cases of civilians being hanged for treason and in other cases, the SS units evacuating the town.  Interestingly, the author  has tracked down the men who did hanging and reported on the final judgement on these individuals, many years after the end of the war.<br /><br />I found this book to be well written and to contain a wealth of references and sources on the final victory  in the southern part of the Germany and some parts of Austria, as the Allies worked to prevent any post-war continuation of hostilities.on and in other cases, the SS units evacuating the town.

Oxford University Press, 2004.<br /><br />This is an excellent reference book for anyone interested in the history of the papacy, the present method of electing a pope and the possible candidates for the job when the present Pope, John Paul II, dies. The author addresses the almost two thousand years' history of the papacy, the methods once employed in choosing a pope and the development of  the current conclave approach.  Be aware that this takes some 174 pages of text written by John-Peter Pham, and then, from page 175 up to page 318, there are some seven (7) appendices.  The Appendices make this a great reference book.<br /><br />Appendix 1 is a listing of all the popes, which brings up a touchy issue for the author, John-Peter Pham.  According to his reckoning, there have only been 261 popes, and I want to underline the word, \\"popes\\".  As John-Peter Pham points out there have been 263 pontificates, but,  since Benedict XI served on three separate occasions, there have been only 261 persons.  Counting separately all three terms of Benedict XI results in 263 popes.  So,  this is similar to counting Grover Cleveland as two separate presidents, even though he was only one person,  because he served two separate and distinct presidential terms: 1885-1889 and 1893-1897. (Take a look at the notes, page 319 for a better explanation.)  In Appendix 3, the author presents a list of \\"Cardinals Presently Eligible To Vote In A Conclave\\", (from page 213 to 289).  By inference, the next pope will probably be chosen from these men. This is already outdated as Belgium's Jan Pieter Cardinal Schotte died on January 10, 2005.  Then,  the last wills and testaments of popes John XXIII and Paul VI are in Appendix 6 and Appendix 7, respectively. It is really not clear to me why the author included such legal documents.  Perhaps he wants to provide precedents for future popes?<br /><br />If you want a one-volume,  concise reference for the history and election of the popes, this is it./>If you want a one-volume,  concise reference for the history and election of the popes, this is it.  <br />	2005-03-22

Subtitled \\"The Epic Story Of The 761st Tank Battalion, WWII's  Forgotten Heroes\\". Broadway books, New York, 2004.<br /><br />Studying History gives you exposure to the overall events of World War II, and the general ebb and flow of the European Theater of Operations, such as which unit attacked which enemy unit and the results. After an MA in History,  I am always seeking more interesting personal accounts, i.e. personal reminiscences, describing what really happened.  This book, \\"Brothers In Arms\\", appeared to be just that: the personal memoirs of black soldiers in a tank battalion in the EOT, with all those daily minimal details, woven into a real and personal story of the men who served.  Even more interesting, these soldiers were black.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the book did not live up to its promise.  The stories about the individuals involved, with the possible exception of  Leonard \\"Smitty\\" Smith, did not, in my humble opinion, bring those individuals alive.  Even the nice repetition , (but disrupting to the continuity of the book), of Baseball's Jackie Robinson's wartime experiences were not truly a personal remembrance.<br /><br />Then there are the unnecessary mistakes.  As other reviewers have mentioned the worst gaffe, the German word for panther, is \\"Panther\\" and \\"Panzer\\" means, basically,  armor or tanks.  See page 47.  The Luftwaffe's  rotund Hermann Goering is probably rotating rapidly in his grave since this book identifies him as the skinny Nazi propaganda minister.  On page 45, the authors state that  in the Pacific theater, in 1942, \\"American and Japanese forces were at a stalemate\\".  Sorry!  The Battle of Midway, June 1942, was the turning point and it was downhill for Japan after that. The \\"stalemate\\" characterization  was wrong.  On page 70, the authors have General George S. Patton being born in 1895; he was born in 1885.  Just as another example,  the book states that the German \\"Teller\\"  Anti-Tank mines had about one pound of explosive in them.  I could not understand why a \\"Teller\\" mine should threaten a Sherman tank, so I went on the Web.  There I found that the early models of the German Teller mines  had about 23 pounds, or about ten kilograms, of explosive.  I could see that this concentrated explosive force could do damage to some parts of the Sherman.  My complaint is the book's authors let this poundage gaffe go into print.<br /><br />So , for the personal memoirs, I gave four stars.  For the mistakes , (too many!) and evident lack of knowledge about the History of the EOT, I gave zero stars.

Kelly, Liturgical Press, Collegeville, Minnesota, 2004.<br /><br />This book covers exactly what the title says, \\"The Origins of Christmas\\".  Professor Kelly presents the establishment of Christmas as an important feast day in the Christian Church, with both eastern and western  roots. Drawing heavily on the scriptural nativity stories, found in the Gospels of St Mark and St. Luke, the author shows the roots of  story of the Three Kings, then Star over Bethlehem, the Flight into Egypt and many more commonly held aspects of Christmas as the present age knows it.  Using historical analysis, Dr. Kelly makes it clear that Christ was probably born between 6 B.C,. to 4 B.C., (based upon the records for the death of Herod) and that the ancient Church chose December 25th as the date for celebrating the Birth of Christ as a holy remedy to Roman extravaganzas in that month of the year.  Kelly shows how Christmas and Epiphany developed as competing feast days for the Nativity of Christ in Orthodox Catholic and Roman Catholic branches of Christendom.  He also devotes some little time to St. Nicholas and how that saint's feast day metamorphosed into a gift giving day in certain countries (e.g. The Netherlands).<br /><br />This is not, however, a book that deals with the tinsel: the origins of Christmas trees, or Christmas decorations  or Christmas lights.  Christmas carols are hardly mentioned, and the more modern aspects of Christmas, such Prince Albert's  introduction of  Christmas trees to England, are not emphasized in Kelly's book.  If you want a bible-based analysis of the origins of Christmas, and how the biblical story grew into today's modern story of  Christmas, then this is the book for you.	2005-02-02

The author begins with a chapter, \\"Saxons\\",  tracing the common roots of the present day peoples of both Britain and Saxony.  Remember, historically, the \\"Anglo-Saxons\\" displaced the Celtic peoples who inhabited England.  In the next four chapters, Frederick Taylor develops Dresden's history, from a swampy frontier settlement to the \\"Florence on the Elbe\\".  Then, the author devotes at least three chapters to the impact of National socialism on Dresden, including a chapter irreverently entitled , \\"The Saxon Mussolini\\".<br /><br />Then, the heart of the book may be found in the chapters in which Taylor addresses the air war in general, its morality and  its effectiveness.  I wish that I had this book for course on World War II that I took while working on an MA in History.  We spent a quite a few class sessions dealing with the effectiveness of Air Power, and whether or not Sea Power or the Infantry won the war.  Taylor's book presents new insights into the methods employed to measure Air Power's effectiveness. (or ineffectiveness, if you care to take the other point of view).<br /><br />There are chapters dealing with the actual horrors of the actual raid.  The author brings into print an examination of how the German people felt as they realized they had survived the night raid by the RAF but were then attacked by the day raid of USAAF.  Obviously,  the author's ability in the German language helped him to present a more human side of the event.<br /><br />In the last few chapters, Taylor shows how the Soviets used the bombing raid as propaganda  during the Cold War; the enormous number of causalities, quoted by the Third Reich, were cast in concrete by the Soviets.  Even in death, the people were being used by tyrannical masters.<br /><br />In the chapter entitled, \\"The Sleep Of Reason\\", on page 411,  the author states, \\"It is rarely mentioned that almost exactly the same number of Soviet citizens died  as a result of bombing during the Second World War as Germans: around half a million\\".  Then he recounts the Luftwaffe's  \\"...\\"thousand-bomber raid\\" ...on Stalingrad.  From an engineering point of view, i.e. form, fit and function, it appears the German air force, the Luftwaffe, was able to perform as well as the combined forces of the RAF and the USAAF. Although the German Dorniers and Heinkels may not have been as excellent a bomber as were the British Lancasters and the American Liberators,<br /><br />the Luftwaffe, by Taylor's own accounting, killed as many people as did the Allies.  Form, fit and function means that although the designs were different the end results were the same.

Subtitled, \\"A Rifleman Remembers World War II. Louisiana State University Press, 1992.<br /><br />When Leon Standifer volunteered, he was a tall, lanky Southern boy who had not traveled  far his home town of Clinton, Mississippi.  The book begins with a letter dated \\"Sept. Beats me, 15? 1944, Somewhere in France\\".  Professor Standifer had signed up for the Army Specialist Training Program (ASTP), where deserving individuals (read \\"smart guys\\"), would be sent through college by the U. S. Army and then be expected to later serve in positions that were technically demanding.  The war, however, changed all that and Leon Standifer and all the other ASTP soldiers, were given some basic infantry training and were shipped to France.  Standifer, assigned to the 94th Infantry Division, landed in Normandy in August 1944, and then went to Lorient, France to contain German troops in a pocket. Combat was not heavy there, but he saw Americans getting killed.<br /><br />Standifer's training made him into the \\"point man\\", the soldier who would lead the advance towards an enemy's position.  Standifer's book  presents a complete account of combat,  from the of the fear in leading patrols to the abrasive routine life of a soldier waiting for something to happen. He was wounded (perhaps by friendly fire)  and came back to his company near in January 1945.  In that bitter Winter, Leon developed pneumonia and frozen feet; he was rotated out to England and did not return to Europe until the War was almost over.  Thus, he experienced much of the European Theater of Operations: landing in Normandy a few months after D-Day, the drudgery of siege-like waiting, being wounded, returning to his unit, and then finding some of his old friends missing, not being accepted the \\"new\\" old-hands in the unit and the joy of seeing hostilities ending.  This book documents many of the experiences of many of the soldiers in ETO.	2004-09-25

Subtitled: \\"The Boy Who Wore Two Uniforms\\".  Archon Books, 1992.<br /><br />This is a personal memoir of a young German boy,  born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island,  but growing up in Germany during the Second World War.  During the Great Depression, the parents of Walter Schroder returned to Germany for economical reasons.  So, young Walter had to adjust to using the German language every day in school and was \\"tagged\\" as an outsider because of his accent.  As the Second World War wore on, Walter Schroder was fundamentally drafted in the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, which had responsibility for anti-aircraft weapons.  The book begins with the end of the war and the capture of Schroder's Luftwaffe unit by British troops, with his subsequent incarceration in a British POW camp.  Schroder used his ability to speak English,  (even though he sounded like a \\"Yank\\"),  to help himself and his fellow prisoners .  Then, it was discovered that he was born in the United States, one thing leads to another, and  he is set free in England, returns to the Continent  where he joins the Untied States Army, and before he reaches the age of 21 years, he has served both Germany and the U.S., both \\"Stars And Swastikas\\".

Subtitled: \\"Memories Of a German Girl\\".  Southern Illinois University Press, 1982.<br />This is a very personal memoir of a young German girl, growing up during the Second World War.  Born in 1927, Regina Maria was just reaching womanhood when the Soviet tanks were entering eastern Germany: Silesia, Pomerania, Prussia, etc.  She begins the book with a brief story concerning visiting modern Communistic German in the 1980s,  and, with one anecdote, she makes the point that the Communistic German border guards were as repressive, if not more so, than the old Nazi party members.  Then, in the next chapter,  she jumps to a nostalgic but wonderfully vivid description of Christmas Past, before the War:  \\"Christmas began on the day that Mama melted the butter and honey in an enormous tin pan...\\" (p. 19).  I have to tell my own children that Christmas Eve was once a fast day, with no eating until Midnight Mass,  and I sense a kinship of the Past gone by with this writer, even though my Christmases were in NYC and hers in Germany.<br />Her last chapter deals with what the Poles have done to her hometown, her childhood town.<br />\\"My sentimental quest for my hometown is over.

Standifer.  Subtitled: \\"An American Soldier In Occupied Germany, 1945-1946\\"  Louisiana State University Press, 1997.<br />The theme of this book is set by the quotation of  the part of Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, which we all know and which is triggered in our memories by \\"With malice toward none...\\"  In this, his second book on the War, retired professor Leon C. Standifer recounts his experiences in dealing with the conquered  German people, learning a little of the German language and learning, it seems, a lot about life and the opposite sex. Professor Standifer has written a very charitable book, using  the  Second Inaugural Address  (March 4, 1865) for a framework for a theme of forgiveness and understanding with the defeated Germans. So many Americans, who tend to quote this section of Lincoln's Address, neglect that in that Address, Lincoln also said that it would be just if  the tragedy of the Civil War continue \\"... until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword\\".  This clearly applied to the Germans who had drawn so much blood.<br />In his first book (see \\"Not In Vain: A Rifleman Remembers World War II\\"), the good professor gives the story of his days in combat and how he earned the Combat Infantryman's Badge, that pale blue emblem of having served on the front line.  In this present book,  Standifer tells the story of his unit's adventures as they begin to understand the Germans as fellow human beings, and not as targets on the field.  Since he started out as a very young  man from the \\"back woods\\" of Mississippi, he grew up in combat and then he was first exposed to urban life in the old cities of the Sudetenland and  Bavaria.  Throughout the year in occupied Europe, (he says that he had a \\"ball\\"),  his experiences were firmly filtered through his fundamental Christianity and his background in segregated Mississippi.  I can understand some of his background.  A dozen years after the time of his book, (1958), I was stationed at Naval Air Technical Training Center, Memphis, and, as a Native New Yorker, I found the segregation in Tennessee to be irritating and different enough to be exotic.  Further, in all of Memphis, they did not know what a pizza was, let alone know how to make pizza.  (I suspect that national chain restaurants have changed all that today.)  So, Standifer's outsider's account of beer drinking, Catholic Bavarians rings true.  I suspect that some of the nostalgia that seems apparent on the author's part is due to the fact that 1945-1946 was a happy year when he was young.

Germans in Silesia is nothing new.  The Germans have been in Silesia since at least 1210, when they were invited to colonize the swampy land (slightly longer than the English colonists in Massachusetts).  The young boy speaks German and Polish, as he was taught by his mother.  The older brother, Pawel, however, was of an age between the two World Wars, that he refused to learn German.<br />Gracian, at 15 years old, likes to sneak out in the middle of the night to gaze upon the stars.  He has a special place, a clearing in the forest, but, of course, he risks being shot for violating curfew.  His older brother, Pawel Solka,  had given Gracian a book on astronomy, which Gracian employs to learn the names of all the constellations.  To protect Gracian, Pawel has to nail the window shut, so that Gracian can no longer sneak out.  As Gracian works in the coal mines (Silesia is famous for its coal), he learns the story of how Pawel was disgraced by having  to serve a sentence in a German prison for smuggling, across the German/Poland border.  Gracian begins to understand  some of the roots of family conflicts and animosity. (Interestingly,  since colonial days in Massachusetts, smuggling has never been disgraceful.  Even in recent times, during Prohibition, an Irish-American became rich smuggling in whiskey;  his son became President of the United  States.)<br />Using his German speaking skills, Gracian helps Pawel to land a job in another, more distant coal mine.  The owners, bosses and foremen are all Germans,  Pawel now has job, too, and this pacifies their mother.  Things appear to be settling down.  Gracian expands his star-watching  to people watching, using the telescope that was another gift from his brother, Pawel.  Towards the end, Gracian believes that his star watching/people watching might have been responsible for the death of Pawel's girl-friend, Anna.  Finally, at the end, Gracian puts away his book and telescope, as with St. Paul: \\"...when I became a man, I put away childish things\\".  (I Corinthians, 13:7).

Caine, sub-titled: \\"Evading Capture In WWII Europe\\".  Brassey's, Dulles,  Virginia, 1997<br />The author is a retired Brigadier General, United States Air Force, where he was once responsible for  training at the Air Force Academy for \\"SERE (survival, evasion, resistance, escape). This gave him a professional interest in the history of evaders in Nazi occupied Europe. Philip D. Caine has also written books on Americans serving in in the Royal Air Force,  (e.g. in the \\"Eagle Squadron\\") including \\"American Pilots In The RAF\\".<br />In this book, \\"Aircraft Down\\", he has drawn on his training and experience to write six separate stories, of individuals and crews, shot down behind the lines in enemy held Europe.  The first three stories deal with Americans who were flying in the RAF. These three were fighter pilots, who came down alone.  They were not alone on the ground, however,  as they all needed the help of the local populace to escape Nazi searchers.<br />The fifth story is different: the entire crew of a B-17 Flying Fortress comes down on the island of Corfu, off the coast of Albania/Greece.  Here, again, the common thread is that he local populace has to work together to first provide refuge for the evaders and then to provide a means of escape.<br />In all of the stories in this book, the author has worked to put a human face on the evaders.  His research has been sufficient to give a personal memoir flavor to each story, and his follow-up on post war meetings, provides a sense of closure to the story.  He relates the excitement when an evader  meets the same woman working in the same field as on the day he was shot down, some 40+ years ago.<br />The book is concluded with a very short chapter entitled, \\"The Art Of Evasion And Survival\\", which points up that the personal resourcefulness  of the downed pilot is often the key to a successful escape. General Caine has avoided the usual impersonal book, often written by General Officers, dealing with  statistics numbers and unit identification, all at the \\"higher\\" strategic level.  Instead,  happily, he has used personal interviews and much research  to provide a fine book telling the stories almost as if they were all personal memoirs.icers, dealing with  statistics numbers and unit identification, all at the \\"higher\\" strategic level.

Rutter, Sub-titled, \\"a Year In An A-20\\".  Texas A&amp; M University Press, 2004.<br />For many of us who were young boys during World War II, or directly after, the most famous aircraft were the big bombers: the B17 \\"Flying Fortress\\", the B24 \\"Liberator\\" and the B29 \\"Superfortress\\". The relatively small A20 \\"Havoc\\" was hardly mentioned.<br />This book corrects that ommission. Joseph  Rutter flew the A20 \\"Havoc\\" in some 64 combat missions in the A20 in the Pacific Theatre.  The author lists all 64 missions on pages xv through xxi in the preface to the  his book , which is quite a personal memoir of his war.  The book actually starts with his father getting the author out of bed \\"...at 6 A.M. on Sunday, September 3, 1939 to listen to Great Britain's declaration of war on Germany...\\"  Page 8.  The author then tells of growing up, graduating high school, going to work for the FBI, and then leaving for flight school.  He learned to fly both the B25 \\"Mitchell\\" and the A20 \\"Havoc\\",  but it is apparent, in my humble opinion, that Mr. Rutter really loved the A20 the best.<br />The book presents many details about the A20, with pictures scattered appropriately throughout the book.  On page 105, the photo shows a pilot, Maury Owen, seated in an A20 cockpit.  It is a tight fit.  A big person, (say, the actor John Wayne, for easy identification), could never fit  in the standard A20 cockpit.  Rutter gives many somewhat technical details about flying the A20, including  setting the manifold pressure to prevent backfiring of the engines,  how to lean the gas mixture to fly the maximum distance  and the proper method of firing the guns to prevent jams, and all of this material makes you understand in small fashion what it was like to live and fly in the Pacific War.  Since the author was able to develop many of the pictures he snapped , he was able to bring the photos home with him.  Therefore, the book is nicely illustrated with contemporary photos , including, for example, the village church at Dagupan, Luzon, the Philippines.  (Page 184).<br />If you want a complete story of what it was like, flying and fighting in the Pacific Theater in World War II, this book is an excellent choice.hotos , including, for example, the village church at Dagupan, Luzon, the Philippines.

Recorded Books, Inc.1998.<br />The noted author and Historian of the West, Dee Alexander Brown, has branched out into fiction with this lengthy tale of delivering two camels from Missouri to Bright Star, Indiana. There are really two plot lines in this engaging novel.  The first is the telling of the actual driving of the camels from war-torn (Civil War)  Missouri to Indiana.  It seems that Union Captain Solomon Lightfoot has dreams of a farming empire where camels would replace the horse and the ox.  The good Captain \\"enlists\\" the services of Johnny Hawkes, young Ben Butterfield and a girl with the name of Jack Bonnycastle.  With the aid of the Egyptian camel driver, Hadjee, this little group starts out towards Indiana.  Their adventure allows Dee Brown to elicit the mannerisms, language and the simpler culture of a time long ago.  This is told in the third person.<br />The second plot line, in the first person,  presents the reminiscences of an older Ben Butterfield.  It has to be some forty years later, since the characters discuss the assassination of William McKinley (1843-1901) and wonder if Pres. Roosevelt will be able to handle the office.  (That's Teddy Roosevelt!)  As the older Ben Butterfield  remembers and relates, Dee Brown paints a picture of turn-of-the-century America, a simpler time when the telephone was becoming a jangling nuisance and rowing down a local river was considered a wonderful outing for the more adventurous in the town.<br />The novel comes to a nostalgic conclusion as the elder Ben Butterfield approaches his old circus that has come to town.  He hopes to see his old friend,  Jack Bonnycastle, who was really a girl, by the name of \\"Queen Elizabeth Jones\\".  It seems that this girl had developed into a noted equestrian, who performed before the crowned heads of Europe.  Due to a broken leg, Ben had been left behind as Queen Elizabeth and the circus had gone on to fame and  glory.  Ben Butterfield had always loved Queen Elizabeth Jones.  The ending is rather sad but touching.<br />Tom Stechschulte does an excellent job in reading this book, nine full cassettes.  The reader gives an unique and appropriate to the many different characters, ranging from wounded Southern soldiers to Hadjee, who has a little English and a little French.  Well done.  This presentation helped me to endure Boston Traffic.ad always loved Queen Elizabeth Jones.

The book presents the entire carol.  Each stanza of the carol faces an illustration portraying the action in the song: for example, at the beginning, the good King is actually looking out a window, with the wind obviously ruffling the pages of a book on a chair.  King Wenceslas is presented as young man, with a concerned look on his face as he sees the tattered peasant \\"...gathering winter fuel.\\"  As the Page and the King carry food and pine logs to the peasant's dwelling, the winter cold grows harsher.  The King tells the Page to walk in his foot steps, and the Page finds warmth in each foot print.  I have always thought of this as an echo of  Christ telling St. Peter to leave the boat and walk across the water to Him.<br />I look forward to my granddaughter, Katlain, using the music at the back of the book to play this carol at Christmas time, while my daughter, her aunt, supports her on the piano.  Excellent book! That can become a family heirloom.	2004-05-05

Samuel<br />Wolfgang turned ten years old in February 1945, just as Soviet tanks were marching towards the town of Sagan in East Germany.  (Sagan is now Zagan in Poland).  The author has written an excellent book about being a boy in that time.  This book is NOT about Germany's losing Pomerania, Silesia East Prussia, etc.  Col. Samuel has been able to capture the memory of  his feelings as a small boy as his world collapses around him.  Besides the usual trials and tribulations of a boy growing up, Wolfgang had to deal with being afraid and distrustful of adults, of being the refugee outsider in close-knit German villages and being  \\"from the big city\\" in these small villages. All of these things most boys do not want to be.  Somehow, Col. Samuel has been able to capture the boyish feelings  he had years ago and write them down in this very personal memoir.<br />The adult Samuel was able to capture the childhood way of thinking.  For example, on page 70, he writes, \\" I became uneasy at seeing the barrier.  If they had build tank barriers, they must be expecting Russian tanks.  My sense of security diminished... .\\"  In other sections, he records his childhood reproaches of mostly his mother, and somewhat, of his father.  It is as if his parents were somehow to blame for much of the difficulties he experienced.  He does not, however, record any feeling of reproach for himself, as when, e.g.  foolishly, he walks through a raging blizzard to go to school, even though his mother had warned him not to do so. His distrust of adults is further justified when the baker, to whom he is apprenticed,  switches Wolfgang  form the union-inspected room to housing in a bombed -out ruin, after the union  inspector has left the premises.  On the other hand, he has only good things to say about both sets of grandparents.<br />Colonel Samuel's childhood experiences would make most of us very cynical;  he has survived them to have a productive thirty year career in the United States Air force.ctive thirty year career in the United States Air force.	2004-04-24

She clearly recognized details of our actual train ride with the same elements in the colorful illustrations and the words in the book.  She sat quite still as I read this wonderful book to her.  The book's author has obviously chosen her words to echo the sounds of a train:  \\"What shall we see?  What shall we see?\\"  And, as you read the book,  if you throw in a couple of extemporary \\"Choo-choos\\" , you can set up a train sound in your reading.<br />The colors of the illustrations are bright; seems like the originals were done in pastel chalks.  My granddaughter noticed that the locomotive was red, which was not the color on the train ride into Boston.  The dark black of the tunnel was scary, but, on the next page, all fears were relieved when the tunnel darkness turned the window into an impromptu mirror.  Tabitha laughed at the page with the words, aa\\"gaggle of geese\\", and said \\"gaggle\\" quite a few times as she tried out this new word.  She was most happy to find, at the end of  \\"The Train Ride\\", there was Grandma (who looked quite a bit like Mommy), waiting for them at the station.  This is a most entertaining book.	2004-04-22

Hornfischer.  Subtitled \\"The Extraordinary World War II Story Of The U.S. Navy's Finest Hour\\".  Bantam Books, 2004.<br />From the biographical information on the WEB, it does not appear that the author, James Hornfischer, served in the Untied States Navy; this makes his book even more of an amazing accomplishment.  He has absolutely captured the essence of an enlisted man in the US Navy, so much so that I can smell the gray paint (oil-based) that we slopped  around the compartment in the Naval Air Training Center, Norman, Oklahoma.  I can still remember the Chief warning us not to let the paint go on too thick as the paint would burn during action.  ...As if we would ever see a battle in NATTC, Norman, which was about as far from either ocean as you could get.  I was there as an Airedale in 1958, and, being Irish, I was proud of the Kelly green diagonal stripes on my dress blue jumper.  In my opinion, Hornfischer has captured the quintessence of the feeling or disdain that the black shoe navy had for aviation, the brown shoe navy.  The author has taken all these minimal details and woven a real and personal story of the men who served  in the little \\"Taffy\\" fleet that was attacked by Imperial Japanese Navy that day in October, 1944.<br />First, he has addressed what the noted historian, John Keegan, was not willing to consider in his book, \\"The Face of Battle\\" (Viking Press, 1995):<br />personal courage in naval actions.  In at least three places in \\"Tin Can Sailors\\", Hornfischer tells how it feels to be going into action where the chances of survival are nil.  Yet they went: courage to stay at your station and to continue to load and fire despite the odds.  Second, his detailed account of the action makes a good case for the fact that the Imperial Japanese Navy withdrew, NOT because they had misidentified the USN ships they were facing but rather because Japanese ships had been damaged so much.  This book gives a detailed account of the damage inflicted by the destroyers (both DD and DE) and by the naval aircraft that were constantly strafing and bombing the Japanese ships.  Even American (or British) admirals would hesitate  if so many of their vessels had been so damaged.<br />Last, and it seems fitting in this book, the author only briefly mentions Admiral \\"Bull\\" Halsey.  Halsey's misinterpretation of the strategic situation led to the potential disaster in Leyte Gulf; the heroism of the ordinary seamen  prevented the disaster while writing a chapter of bravery. for the United Sates Navy.a detailed account of the damage inflicted by the destroyers (both DD and DE) and by the naval aircraft that were constantly strafing and bombing the Japanese ships.

McPherson.  Sub-titled, \\" The Battle That changed The Course Of The Civil War\\".  Oxford University Press, 2002.<br />As so many of the 53+ reviewers  have noted, this book is NOT a blow by blow account of the Battle of Antietam, September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in American history.  Many of those friendly reviewers suggested other books which give an account of the actual battle, itself.  The author, the noted Historian James M. McPherson, spent much of the front part of the book developing the political, military and international situation just prior to the Battle of Antietam.  The condition of the Union was far bleaker than I had realized.  President Abraham Lincoln seized on any success, even the slight and scanty success of Antietam, to promulgate his Emancipation Proclamation.<br />But, what I would like to point out is that  McPherson's book is a scathing indictment of the actions of Union General, George Brinton McClellan, (1826-1885).  McClellan was certainly the most controversial of the Union generals.  He ran against President Lincoln in the  election of 1864.  When I was working on my MA, History, at Bridgewater State,  the joking comment in the Civil War class was that , after Robert E. Lee, General McClellan was the best general that the Confederacy had.  If , in the modern Gulf War, a modern Army general had done one-tenth of the things that McPherson wrote about McClellan (e.g. hold back his reserve troops  when needed in battle), then that modern General surely have been found guilty by a court-martial.  So, if you are ever required to write a paper on the failings of McClellan, take it from this book.	2004-03-18

Sub-titled, \\" the American Infantry In Northwestern Europe, 1944-1945.\\"  The Modern Library, New York 2003.<br />The Picture on the dust jacket tells it all:  there is a very young face, topped by a helmet, in the center of the page.  He is looking directly at you, and, hauntingly, you wonder if he survived.  Paul Fussell has written subjects as diverse as \\"English Augustan Poetry\\" and travelogues, but his main contribution has been books on modern war.  In this, his latest work, he emphasizes the youth of the Americans thrown into the \\"Second Front\\" with the June 6th 1944 Normandy invasion.<br />The author's emphasis, however, is not on  the bravery and achievements of the American Army in the European Theater of Operations, but rather, on the mistakes made.  For example, the author deals with the bloody full frontal assault on Omaha Beach, the horrors in the Huertgen Forest and the incorrect bombing in Operation Cobra.  All of these operations killed the young Americans pouring into Hitler's Fortress.  He devotes an entire chapter to the replacement system, which resulted in<br />\\"... infantry divisions with sterling histories ... become lamentable caricatures of what they once were  and  (are now) ... populated  by the inadequately trained and the largely unwilling.\\"  (page 27).<br />In summary, if you ever take a course on World War II, and the professor asks you to  list the major mistakes of the American commanding officers in Europe from 1944 to 1945, all you have to do, is cite this book's  title and  the name of the author, Paul Fussell.	2004-03-10

Parker,  Sub-titled, \\" The History Of the Second World War\\". Oxford University Press, 1990.<br />This is a small book (only 328 pages) and is therefore easy to handle.  But, even though small, Parker's book covers all the important subjects of the Second World War.  The chapters are arranged more or less chronologically, ranging from Chamberlain's pre-war  \\"appeasement\\" to  a final assessment chapter entitled, \\"Casualties, Crisis and Change\\".  Although the author is a Fellow of Modern History at Queen's College, Oxford, he states , up front, that  he has \\"... tried to escape any British prejudices in considering the conduct of the allies\\".  (Page v.)  In my opinion, Parker has done a pretty good job of stating the facts and NOT taking  British, American, French , German, etc. side in any argument.  He has included a chapter on strategic bombing, and, interesting, it appears that he believes strategic bombing did NOT work in German occupied Europe, but that bombing did work against the Empire of Japan.  Chapter 14 deals with the defeat of Japan and the use of the atomic bomb.  Chapter 17 deals with the \\"Murder of European Jews\\" and  the theme of unnecessary and unrequited killing is finished in Chapter 18,  \\"Casualties, Crisis and Change\\".<br />I used this book as quick but complete reference in a World War II course I was taking at Bridgewater State College, when I was working on my MA in History.	2004-03-10

Greeley,  8 Cassettes, Audio Renaissance 2002.<br />There is a saying, \\"There are two kinds of people:  the Irish and those that wish they were.\\"  The author, Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, may have used this saying for a theme in his this latest mystery.  The newly elected president,an Irish Catholic, Jack McGurn, from Chicago, surrounds himself with a close staff that is Irish Catholic, and, artistic license,(patently) they are all portrayed as beautiful, bright, and filled with witty anecdotes and stories.  The major exception in the close staff  is an Italian Catholic Ph.D. from Brooklyn, the resident expert on China. Everything would be fine (except for the opposition of the usual Republicans and right wing radicals) but there is a poltergeist in the White House.<br />Fr. Greeley defines the poltergeist as a presence that causes a ruckus but does no real physical harm.  (I checked on the Web, and there are plenty of examples where the poltergeist presence typically does some nasty physical things... example, biting a young girl on the behind and leaving teeth wounds.)  But any way, artistic license again, (patently) and this White House poltergeist just throws things around;  nothing or no one is hurt.  She is constantly knocking down the portrait of George Washington in the West Wing.  Bishop Blackie has to figure out which woman, of nine potential candidates, is the cause of all the ruckus.  This is the central mystery in the book.  By the way, all the candidates are beautiful, and all are Catholic, except the  least good looking, a WASP with angular features.  By the last cassette,  the \\"elevator doors have opened\\" and the good  Bishop has identified the culprit woman (patently).<br />Paul Michael did a great job on reading the book, with accents for all the characters, although I think that he only approximated a New York accent, not a Brooklyn accent, for lady Ph.D. expert on China.  In my writing conferences, I am constantly being taught to throw out any thing, no matter how well I've written it, that does not advance the central theme or the plot.  So, I do not understand why Fr. Greeley spent so much time on the conversation  (almost an altercation) between the character of President McGurn and the bishop of Washington, DC.  It advanced nothing in the story.  Same thing with the references to stealing the Presidential election in Florida (in 2000).  I counted at least three mentions.  Finally, besides being a noted author, Andrew Greeley is an established sociologist.

My oldest daughter came home from college and convinced me to register Republican (in Massachusetts!).  My daughter and I and the other three children in the family are all Republicans.  Sociologist Greeley should be aware of this shift in the newer generations of Irish Catholics.constantly being taught to throw out any thing, no matter how well I've written it, that does not advance the central theme or the plot.   So, I do not understand why Fr. Greeley spent so much time on the conversation  (almost an altercation) between the character of President McGurn and the bishop of Washington, DC.  It advanced nothing in the story.  Same thing with the references to stealing the Presidential election in Florida (in 2000).  I counted at least three mentions.  Finally, besides being a noted author, Andrew Greeley is an established sociologist.

Warner Books, 2000.<br />In the first few pages of the book, Nestor Masangkay is zapped when he touches a meteor that he has found on an isolated island off the southern most tip of Chile.  Then, for the next 180 pages or so, you are waiting in suspense for the entire expedition (set up by an American billionaire) to be zapped as they are digging up the bright red meteor.  Of course, you know that the entire crew can not be killed, as you have another 250 or pages to read, BUT!, the suspense is there as you turn page after page.<br />Being chased by a destroyer of the Navy of Chile has to be better justified , in my opinion.  The chase chapter,  however, a  cat and mouse game, (and on storm-tossed seas), keeps you reading.  Towards the end  you just know  that the meteor will go to the bottom, but again, the book leaves you wondering as to what will happen next.  This is a fine book to keep you entertained as you travel on a long flight cross country or across the Atlantic.	2004-02-20

The author, Dale Lott, has spent much of his life, if not his entire life, observing and studying the animals commonly called \\"buffalo\\".  Clearly, this excellent book is a labor of love for him.  He deals with all the relationships that the bison (buffalo) have established in order to survive, ranging from microscopic bacteria up to the greatest predator, Man.  Chapters are devoted to  obvious relationships such as Chapter 1,  \\"Bull to Bull and Cow to Bull\\", interesting in how important the sex drive is, but also how important survival is.  Some unseen relationships are described in Chapter 5, \\"Digestion: Grass to Gas and Chips\\" ... who would have thought?  The buffalo (bison) once roamed this North American continent in the millions, and Professor Lott (Emeritus, U. Cal., Davis), spends an entire chapter (Chapter 8)  on how many  buffalo there once were.  He makes a stand for 30 million or so, which is about half the 60 million bison  usually accepted.<br />Throughout the book, Prof. Lott sprinkles interesting comments which grab your attention.  He defines the bison  as \\"Living according to a `fat economy'\\", which means, as with bears, the bison must accumulate enough food reserves in the Spring and  Summer to last them through the cruel Winter.  He calls this, \\"making fat while the sun shines.\\"  In the chapter on \\"Digestion\\", he describes the necessity of bacteria in the many stomachs of bison for the breaking down of the grasses which they eat.  Then, out of the clear blue, he brings in the analogy, \\"It's a sobering fact  that 12 or 13 percent of a bottle of ...Champagne is bacteria pee.\\" (Page 49)  These little gems are scattered throughout an otherwise serious book that tells  you more than you could imagine about the American Bison. Read the book because of the subject, but then, read the book just to see how many common sayings the author has  twisted to fit the subject!	2004-02-13

Sub-titled: \\"The Adamses, 1713-1918\\".<br />Understandably, this book concentrates on the two presidents, John Adams and John Quincy Adams.  Their contributions as one-term presidents help to establish democracy in the nascent United States.  Brookhiser notes that the two Adamses were the first presidents not from Virginia.  Much of what John Adams did became precedents for later presidents.<br />It appears to me that the author makes the tacit  assumption that the reader has a fairly good knowledge of  American history, so he casually introduces lesser know subjects, such as the \\"Know Nothing Party \\" (Native American Party) and the anti-Masonic efforts in upstate New York.  This, of course,  leads you to things that you want to examine further, but, on the other hand, inhibits the free-flow of the book.<br />I think that the author  is stretching to consider Charles Francis or even Henry Adams as \\"greats\\" who were continuing the Adams \\"dynasty\\".  I did, however, enjoy Brookhiser's  \\"book review\\" approach to  \\"The Education of Henry Adams\\" and Henry's book on Mont St. Michel.  Perhaps the next book by Brookhiser would be the comparison of the contributions  of the Adamses, the Harrisons,  the Roosevelts and the Bushes: all presidents who related by blood.<br />I listened to the seven tapes as I commuted around Boston; excellent reading by Dan Cashman.  It is appropriate to note the name of  the town of Haverhill is pronounced  as  HAV AAAA rill by the natives..  The reader sounded  it out  and said Have  Er Hill, which is logical but not the way it is said in Massachusetts.  Further, the hometown of the Adamses , Quincy, is said as \\"QuinZZZy\\".	2004-02-04

The celebrated Historian, Michael Beschloss, has produced a well-written volume documenting the in-fighting of the Roosevelt Administration on this plan for dealing with Germany after the war was won.  The events after the cessation of hostilities show that the Morgenthau Plan was really implemented.<br />Mr. Beschloss , as with so many American historians,  has neglected, or at least, minimized reporting  what happened to  the eastern part of Germany.  In the west, Allied bombing had destroyed most of the German industry,  In the east, the Red Army did the same.  Towards the end, Adolph Hitler issued orders to destroy everything in the path of the on-coming Soviets.  Some fanatical German units did just that, while others ignored the Fuhrer's orders.  Thus,  in May 1945, Germany was fundamentally devoid of industry, with  the only untouched areas being small farming towns and villages.<br />The Soviets then forced Germans to leave East Prussia, Silesia and  Pomerania,  and, in turn, forced the Poles west to these now unoccupied lands.  This  has been called the greatest forced migration in history.  Beschloss briefly mentions this on page 258, where he reports that  Stalin  \\"... insisted that giving German land to Poland should be no problem because no Germans were in the region.\\"  The result was a de facto implementation of the Morgenthau Plan: the reduction of Germany into an agricultural nation, struggling to feed its people.  It seems that it was not until the 1949 Berlin Blockade and the subsequent Berlin Airlift that Americans, British and French began the re-vitalization of German industry and the re-birth of the German nation.  Self-interest? Or Christianity and Kindness\\"? (p.105).  One has to wonder if Stalin had been more subtle or more surreptitiously clever, if the Iron Curtain would have reached west to the Rhine and Germany would have disappeared.

After much work, the author has collected in one book a brief but essential biography of each of  \\"250 Canonized and Beatified Lay Men, Women and Children\\".  These saints, so listed, do not include any priests, nuns or monks.  There are no popes.  The author's stated goal was to write a book about lay people who achieved sanctity, in order to inspire today's lay people. In so doing, Ms Cruz has provided a compilation of little-known saints of the Catholic Church.  The 250 persons are listed alphabetically, begining  with St. Adalbald of Ostrevant (d. 650) and ending with St. Zita (1218-1278).  Even though I was educated in Catholic schools, from grammar school through college, I have to admit that I did not recognize most of the individuals listed.  In itself, this is a good reason for most of us to buy this book.  Many of us will recognize St. Dominic Savio (1842-1857), who was recently canonized,  the English king, St. Edward the Confessor (d. 1066), and, of course, the English Statesman, St. Thomas More (1478-1453).  But what about  Zdislava Berka of the former Czechoslovakia? Or St. Lufthild (d. c. 850).<br />Joan Cruz has complied a collection of mini-biographies of lay saints; this book is interesting and informative.  The 250 people listed represent many different nationalities, and, time wise, from the early beginnings of the church up to the present, (for example Blessed Marcel Callo (1921-1945), a Frenchman who died in a Nazi concentration camp).  This book is highly recommended as a worthwhile reference work.	2003-06-28

O'Connor, (with David Newton and Richard Bromley), John Wiley &amp; sons, Chichester &amp; New York, 1996. Third Edition Revised.<br />Back in the 1980s, I used the first edition of this book, and it was very helpful then.  The third edition has been expanded to add a few chapters, including what I would call a \\"motivational\\" first chapter, entitled, \\"Introduction To Reliability Engineering\\", pages 1 to 16.  This first chapter answers many of the questions that management used to ask, and to whom the final reply was, \\"We do Reliability because it is a contract item\\".  Now, you can refer the managers to the first chapter.<br />The original edition once began with Chapter 2, \\"Reliability Mathematics\\", fundamental needed to understand Reliability; that chapter has been expanded in this edition, so much so that some has overflowed into Chapter 3, \\"Probability Plotting\\".  Chapter 3 is a very complete chapter, being a compendium of the different kinds of probability paper, along with a short explanation of how to use the paper.<br />Interestingly enough, Chapter 5, \\"Reliability Prediction and Modeling\\" had a shipboard missile system reliability problem (pages 129-132) which was an explicit example of what we were attempting to portray on one contract.  When the Naval Officers saw O' Connor's example, it made it so much easier for us as our work paralleled expert's work in the book's example.  This alone was worth the price of the book.  Chapter 10, \\"Software Reliability\\" is greatly expanded over the previous editions and is up-to-date with current best practices in the field.  This new edition of the book is highly recommended as it provides a concise collection of reliability fundamentals.  John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.	2003-06-11

A complaint by an Australian caseworker in Iraq begins an UK investigation into Augustus Peake and why he is engaged in a sniper's duel in Iraq. The investigation shows that the entire adventure was not so spontaneous as it first seems. So, on the first level, this is a very personal duel between the neophyte (but excellent marksman) Gus Peake and the head of the school for sniping in Iraq, Major Karim Aziz. When we first meet Major Aziz, he is prone on a roof, seeking an opportunity to shot (it seems) the President of Iraq, our friend Saddam. There is much introspection presented, both for Gus Peake and for Major Aziz, as both snipers consider the finality of the tools they use. The climax of the book is the sniper's duel between the two men.<br />On a second level, this book is a fine compendium of the history of sniping. The author, Gerald Seymour, uses the necessity of explanations for the young Kurdish boy and assistant to Gus, to present the history, of modern sniping, from the American Civil War up to the present. Seymour tends to introduce characters to present points. For example, he has a rotund Russian, interested in the mineral rights to the land, (if the Kurds win), tell the story of the famous sniper's duel at the Battle of Stalingrad. The author also uses a British character, an ex-corporal, to explain to Augustus Peake how a sniper, together with carefully place land mines, can halt a column of armor. Gus does just that!<br />On the third level, the author, Seymour, makes a telling statement against the vested interests of Americans, British, Israelis and Russians, in raising the hopes of the Kurdish people but not truly supporting them in their struggle against the despotic government of Iraq. All of these outsiders were using the Kurds as proxy fighters. At the very end of the book, the Kurds retreat back up into the mountains, which they call their only true friends.<br />The book was well read by Sean Barrett, who has a keen ability to provide an accent to match each character. The use of \\"further\\" when \\"farther\\" was needed nettled my ears once or twice or more. When a sniper shoots over a long distance, he has shot \\"farther\\" than any one else. \\"Far\\" for distance, while \\"further\\" is used for consideration, or thought or discussion. Further, when the reporters divide up their gear to carry it all back to the car, they should have divided it \\"among\\" the three of them, not \\"between\\" the three of them.

You Will Be Amazed.<br />\\"The Incorruptibles\\" by Joan Carroll Cruz, Tan Books and Publishers, Rockford, Illinois,<br />On the very first page of her introduction, Joan Cruz specifies that she understands that she is treating a very special case in the preservation of the bodies of saints.  First, she notes that there are three classifications of preserved bodies: (1) deliberately preserved, (2) accidentally preserved and (3) the incorruptibles.  Ancient Egyptian mummies are probably the most familiar examples of deliberately preserved bodies; many of us have seen them in various museums.  In her introduction, Ms. Cruz presents more details than most of us want to know about the modern techniques of embalming and its impact on the body of the deceased.<br />(Pages 27 to 32).<br />Accidentally preserved bodies include the more or less well known cases of bodies found in peat bogs in Denmark, Ireland and Scotland (page 32).  Ms. Cruz presents the interesting case of Bremen Cathedral, Germany, where the cellar burial place tends to mummify any body left there.  Experiments were run using the bodies of animals or fowls, hung in the open-windowed cellar, and the bodies of these animals became mummified.<br />The incorruptibles, however, are those bodies which have been preserved only since Christian times and their preservation is ...\\"even more baffling...\\" since it \\"...seems to be neither dependent upon the manner of burial nor on the temperature or place of interment\\".  Joan Cruz makes a case for the intervention of God as a sign of favor to His saints.  The mystery is \\"...further compounded  ... (with) ...the observance of blood and clear oils\\" which flow from these incorruptibles.  (Page 27).  Her introduction to the book is a clear and pressing statement as to why the 100+ cases she presents are different from mummifying the bodies or from accidental preservation.<br />After her excellent introduction, Joan Cruz then presents, in chronological order, slightly more than a hundred documented cases of individuals whose bodies had been preserved from corruption after their death.  In many of the cases, she provides photographs of the dead bodies, with, perhaps, the most striking and the most beautiful being that of the nun and saint, St. Bernadette Soubirous, (1844-1879), whose body has been preserved intact, \\"...without embalming or other artificial means\\", since 1879.  This is a wonderful book, which will make anyone think again on his mortality, if the book is read with an open mind.than a hundred documented cases of individuals whose bodies had been preserved from corruption after their death.

However, the personal memories are excellent as is the writing.  The book deals with the author's personal experiences in the European Theater of Operations and it seems that he did not record the time in hospital after he was wounded.  Webster's leg wound made him miss the Battle of the Bulge, so he simply alludes to that struggle when he returns to his outfit towards the end of the war.  He does deal with parachuting into Normandy on D-Day and, at the end of the war, chasing the remains of the German Army into the mountains.<br />I think that you could almost sense that the Author was recording the  more \\"exciting\\" days and planning to fill in the more mundane details,  such as his weeks in hospital, when he later had time.  One thing that did come through, loud and clear, was the enlisted man's disdain for the officer corps in the EOT.  Webster's  record of occupation duty, directly after the cessation of hostilities, is entertaining.  I can just picture him, getting ready for his daily swim in the lake, and wondering where he should \\"dine\\" that night.  Enjoyable book!	2003-05-22

Clarke's agenda is not really clear, but when a choice can be made, his writing tended towards the more popular and more sensational.  For example, on page 22, Clarke writes that the Japanese spy, Ensign Yoshikawa, was not on either list of suspects to be detained in case of war.  The implication, of course, being that the FBI and military intelligence were sort of incompetent in pre-war Hawaii.  A very casual check on my part found in John Toland's book, \\" Infamy. Pearl Harbor And Its Aftermath\\", that secret agent Takeo Yoshikawa was burning code books during the Pearl Harbor attack, but within ten minutes of the bombs beginning to fall, \\"...someone shouted, `Open the door!'  The door caved in and Lieutant Yoshio Hasegawa of the Honolulu police burst in with several men.  They began stamping on the smoldering code books\\".  It would seem that Yoshikawa was on someone's list, and to imply otherwise is tending towards sensationalism.<br />On pages 133-134, the author, T. Clarke, presents a case for calling the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the A-bomb drop on Hiroshima as \\"sneak attacks\\".  The sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is obvious, but making the use of a nuclear weapon on Hiroshima \\"sneaky\\" is illogical and sensational.<br />Clarke let his book follow the popular movie plots, so that he tells you, on page 192, that the name of the black mess attendant (recall the movie) on the \\"West Virginia\\" was Doris Miller and that he earned the Navy Cross.  For some reason, however, he does not mention that fifteen (15) Medals of Honor were awarded for the action at Pearl Harbor.  For example, when the \\"Oklahoma\\" turned turtle and capsized, Ensign Francis Flaherty pushed the last sailor out of the turret, thereby trapping himself in the sinking battle ship.  I wonder if Clarke missed a grand  opportunity to develop more \\"ghosts\\" by interviewing the sailors who had been saved by this officer's bravery.  What did those men accomplish in the remainder of the war?  Did they survive? Where are they now?<br />Take a look at the picture of the USS Arizona's band at Bloch Arena (following page 204).  On page 84, Mr. Clarke comments and sees them as ghosts already, \\"...sitting  ... in dress whites  and already a ghostly presence\\".  Unfortunately for Mr. Clarke's comments, in the late 1930s, the U. S. Navy did away with \\"dress white\\" uniforms for enlisted men.  The picture in his book clearly shows the Arizona's band in undress whites with neckerchiefs.<br />Finally, the group that called  the Opana Radar Site as an \\"electrical engineering milestone\\" (page 99) was NOT the Institute of Electrical Engineers, which is British, but rather was the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE),  an American organization, which at 300,000 member engineers is usually considered the world's largest professional group.<br />Sincerely, John Peter Rooney, Senior Member IEEE.in the sinking battle ship.

Each animal has a tiny hole with the appropriate material: the \\"wool\\" for the sheep actually looks like some wool.  The gray \\"fur\\" for the mouse, the last animal, is also a squeaker.

Sub-titled: \\"An American Pilot's Odyssey Through Occupied France And The Camps Of Nazi Germany\\". Henry Holt and Company, New York, 2002.<br />This book is so well written that it reads like a novel, with suspense building up as you turn each page.<br />Will the B-17 pilot, Roy Allen, escape from his badly damaged aircraft? Will he be captured by the Germans? Or be rescued by the French Resistance? The French get to him first and he is assigned to a hiding place in a small village. The young teacher, Colette Florin, hides him as they all await liberation by the Allied Armies coming from the Normandy Beaches. But the Allies are delayed by fierce fighting that Summer of 1944, and Roy Allen decides to leave the relative safety of Colette Florin's rooms above the girls' school. He wants to travel to occupied Paris to reach the Resistance pipeline to get him out of France. It was here that the \\"novel\\" aspects began to overwhelm me. I said to myself that I would not write it that way; it would be more realistic if the American flyer stayed with the French teacher in the so-called \\"Golden Cage\\" and wait for the Allied Armies. Then I saw the photo section (between pages 240 & 241), and I was reminded that Roy Allen actually existed! He was NOT a fictional character. Nor was Colette. They, along with Pierre Muslant, lived and struggled in wartime France. Pierre Muslant was a member of the French Resistance who was to help Roy escape via Paris. Along with Roy, Muslant was captured and died in Buchenwald, so there is only a sketch of him, not a photograph.<br />The excellent writing along with the actual story of this adventure made it almost impossible to put this book down. Just remember, as you read the book, it is fact, not fiction.	2003-04-19

Version, read by Davina Porter.<br />When a neighbor of Chief Inspector Wexford is reported missing, you just know that this is the murder required for this mystery.  Sure enough, a dog sniffs out the body of Rodney Williams, shallow grave!, and Inspector Wexford begins to track down the last days of his neighbor's life.<br />But, who would have thought?  In England? There are two Mrs. Williams, each claiming not to know about the existence of the other.  Bigamy! And then, incest! Rodney's two daughters, separated by miles but so alike in genes.  Was Rodney Williams involved in incest with his oldest daughter, Sarah?  And preparing the other daughter, Veronica, (by the second Mrs. Williams, Wendy) for a turn in the incestuous bed?<br />Did he deserve to die?  The autopsy shows that Rodney was drugged before he was stabbed to death, which leads to the secondary murder,(a necessary cover-up), of the daughter of the local pharmacist. All young ladies were members of the local feminist group. Inspector Wexford investigates this feminist group, whose logo is a raven with the head of a woman, hence the title of the book.  As the Inspector  uncovers more and more, it seems that  Joy Williams, the first Mrs., has to be guilty.  But, so much took place at the home of Wendy, the second Mrs.  She had to be guilty,  or they were working together ...which they deny.  At the end, everything comes to nice  and surprising conclusion, but you still have to wonder: all this in modern-day England?  Who would have thought?<br />The book is well read by Davina Porter, who has the capability of developing an individual, almost unique voice for the Inspector.  Of course, every time the Inspector asks what a person was doing on April 15th, the night of Rodney's murder,  I would say to myself that I knew exactly what I was doing.  In the book, in England, the alibis were always weak.  In the United States, however, the usual answer would have been a very  acceptable alibi: \\"I was doing my income taxes!\\"ual answer would have been a very  acceptable alibi: \\"I was doing my income taxes!\\"	2003-04-16

Audio Book Version read by Christopher Ravenscroft.  Random House Audiobooks, 1997.<br />I chose this audiobook because I thought it would be about the typical Californian or New York road rage where one person is yelling at or even shooting at another driver.  The rage in this book, however, is anger against the building of a road through Markham Wood.  At first it appeared that this might be the usual plot where an environmental group protests the construction of highway by kidnapping hostages.  But, then, there are many plot twists.<br />The hostages were \\"randomly\\" selected by their unfortunate calling for a taxicab from a particular car for hire company.  One of the hostages thus selected is Dora Wexford, wife of Inspector Wexford, which places a personal twist on the efforts of \\"Sacred Globe\\", the kidnapping environmental group, to enforce their position on the authorities.  But there are even more twists than just this one, as Inspector Wexford pieces together all the clues and determines the location where the hostages are being kept, and where a hostage was killed.  The ending is surprising!<br /> I enjoyed the audiotape version of this book, performed by Christopher Ravenscroft, as I drove I-495, the ring road around Boston.  To American ears, Mr. Ravenscroft did a credible job in providing \\"Cockney\\" accents, British police accents and, of course, the educated \\"Oxford\\" accent.  He has a wide ranging repertoire of accents, for both male and female characters.	2003-03-26

On page 13, the authors say, \\"In 1803 George Washington made war against the beys\\".  (\\"Bey\\" being a Turkish or Egyptian title.)  Of course, this is impossible since George Washington died in 1799. I believe the authors wanted Thomas Jefferson.<br />On page 12, \\"Many of these countries are, qua countries with national governments and seats in the United Nations\\"....<br />\\"qua countries\\"?  Forgive me, but is this some South African usage of English/Latin?<br />On page 14, they speak about  the French overrunning Algeria with \\"...European protectorate\\" being called \\"...a nice imperial euphemism\\", which is okay in today's politically correct jargon.  But, then, in the next two  pages the authors describe the French, Italians and Spanish all moving into \\"...provinces of the decaying Ottoman Empire\\"... without sensing the illogic of not defining the Ottoman's imperial aspirations as being as bad as those of the Europeans.  Page 16:  \\"In 1835 the Ottoman Turks sent a fleet to assert a rather more direct control...\\" in what was later called Libya.  What? Italian Europeans in Libya are imperialists and Ottoman Turks do not deserve the same label?  Too Much.  Too politically correct.<br />On page 15: \\"...Tunisia was called Ifriqiyah, from the Roman word for Africa...\\";  now the Romans spoke Roman.  Or was it Latin?  It would have been interesting for the authors to show how \\"Africanius\\" metamorphosed into \\"Ifriqiyah\\".<br />Too much.  Too many.  The authors should submit their manuscript  (it is not yet a book) to a competent historian and to a person competent in geography for fact checking and screening.  While the manuscript is there, perhaps they can do a global change and replace the many contractions, \\"it's\\" and \\"don't\\" with \\"it is\\" and \\"do not\\" respectively.

Sub-titled: \\"An Engineering Approach To The Design And Analysis Of Burn-in Procedures\\".  John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1986.<br />The main purpose of this book is to provide an organized approach to the development and implementation of a burn-in program.  This book does give you the basics in developing burn-in, that is the application of elevated temperature to cause latent defects to fail at the manufacturing plant rather than to have the unit fail during use by the Customer.  The book, however, is truly a rather complete text in reliability, dealing with the three stages of a product: infant mortality, useful life and wear out.<br />I have used this book over the past decade or so, and taken portions of the text for proposals, when a project was just beginning, and, at the other end, used the text for Weibull functions to ascertain the end-of-life of a product. It is an excellent book, describing reliability principles far more clearly than some other fundamental texts.<br />I received this book at a burn-in seminar taught by Dr. Finn Jensen.  Dr. Jensen is a slight, bubbly man, whose English is impeccable.  At the seminar, he fleshed out the examples in the book with details and anecdotes showing that the book, \\"Burn-In\\", is grounded on a wealth of real-life experience.  If you buy one book on burn-in, or on reliability, this is the one.<br />John Peter Rooney, MSEE; ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.	2003-03-12

Little, Brown, and Company, Boston, 1987.<br />The writing in this book is superb.  The insight equals the writing.  Dr. Brendan Phipps was training as a surgeon when the Second World War interfered with his life.  Some forty years later, after the death of his wife and after his children \\"scattered\\", he sat down with a box,  full of  notebooks (\\"...one stained with long-oxidized blood) , reports, a German soldier's paybook and a \\"...few pages of military jargon\\",  to write his memoirs.  He did a great job.<br />His book covers the end of the war in Europe, when American forces were advancing into Germany and it was becoming clear that the war was over.  His comments hit the highpoints of many other books:  \\"...they (the Germans) have dumber generals than we have\\".  (Page 91).  \\"An elderly Irishman ...  (stated)  ... that Germans learned slower than pigs at their Latin.\\"  (Page 90).  American Sherman tanks burn:  \\"Bitter commentary on American engineering.  American slavish addition to high-octane gasoline; diesel-fueled , heavily armored German tanks keep right on coming.\\" (Page 152).  But, throughout it all, he is able to put a human face on the horror and terror that they experienced.  Because of his ability in French and German, Dr. Phibbs also brings some of the other side into his book, as when he describes how the collaborators were dealt with in the so-called Colmar Pocket in France.<br />This book is, perhaps, one of the best-written memoirs of World War II.  His last sentence in the Preface:<br />\\"Please, young people, listen to us before we leave.\\"	2003-03-09

Taylor, Random House, New York 2002.  The title of the book is derived from President Clinton's speech  in France on the fiftieth anniversary of D Day.<br />This is a biography of Joe Beyrle but the book is also a record of praise for the 101st Airborne.  Joe Beyrle, from Michigan, was part of the 101st Airborne when that division dropped into Normandy on D-Day, 1944.  He was captured, escaped, capture again and shipped off to a German POW camp.  After one escape, he is captured in Berlin, the capital city of the Third Reich; he is tortured by Gestapo.  Joe is rescued from the Gestapo by the German Army, the Wehrmacht, of all people, who claim him as their prisoner.  They were following bureaucratic procedures, a common trait in Nazi Germany.  After regaining his strength, Joe Beyrle again escapes, and this time, he is close enough to reach the relative safety of Soviet lines.  After identifying himself as an American, Joe decides to stay with the Soviet armored column in order to kill Germans.  Thus, he fights on both the Western and Eastern fronts in Europe in 1944-1945, fulfilling the sub-title of the book, \\"...Only Soldier to Fight For Both America and the Soviet Union in World War II\\".<br />As a 101st Airborne combat veteran himself, the author was capable of an excellent job of bonding with Joe Beyrle, so as to produce an almost personal memoir direct from the Joe's memories.  At times, it was difficult to distinguish between Beyrle and Taylor.  At other times, particularly in Chapter Sixteen, entitled, \\"Bastogne\\", it was evident that it was all Thomas Taylor writing in praise of the division he loves, the 101st.  From the viewpoint of a biography of Joe Beyrle, such chapters were unnecessary, but their presence rounds out the story and makes a better history of the time.  By the way, the photo collection in the book shows Joe Beyrle aging in a remarkably similar fashion to the character of Private Ryan in the movie, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".ovie, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".	2003-03-07

Hall & Co., 2001, Large Type Book.<br />At first, this book appears to be about a little Dutch boy who survived the Holocaust, and, years later spies his mother's sewing table in an antiques store.  The store owner, Cora Lowenstein, translates the child's inscription, on the bottom of the table, without knowing that it was Tristan Martens, himself, who carved it there years ago.  Her version in English is \\"When the Jews are gone, we will be the next ones\\", which she interprets as in the same fashion as the famous quote from Pastor Niemoeller, (1892-1984).<br />It seems, however, that was not the meaning of the carved words: Tristan Martens (who now had to be in his late sixties or early seventies) knew it was from his Dutch father, who was a Nazi.  Tristan was not a victim of the holocaust; instead, his family was waiting for their turn in power, after the Jews were gone.  Angry Dutch citizens had looted his mother's table from their Dutch home when The Netherlands was liberated.  He feels guilty for most of his life.  This central theme of guilt is always a background plot as Tristan begins to see Cora Lowenstein in a romantic light.  The guilt theme is intertwined, somewhat, with entomology, as he deals with his last graduate student, who, in turn, is dealing with a unique form of insect out in Arizona.  Tristan Martens tells the student's parents how he happened to be an immigrant (as they were) and some of the story of his life directly after the World War.<br />Except for flashbacks to his life in The Netherlands, the book is set mainly in winter-time New York City, with some trips to a nursing home in nearby Connecticut.  I think that the author, Dressler, has done a good job in capturing the flavor of subways and travel in New York. She has written an intriguing book.	2003-03-05

Andrew M. Greeley, Audio book Version narrated by George Guidall.  Recorded Books Productions, New York 2001.<br />The author, Fr. Andrew Greeley, moves the venue for this Bishop Blackie mystery to Paris, and it seems that he certainly knows Paris: at least the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the subway system, many subway stops and the little bistros on the Left Bank.  Using this as backdrop, Fr. Greeley has Bishop John Blackwood Ryan accompany his Cardinal, Sean Cronin, of Chicago, to Paris, where Bishop Blackie is impressed as a detective in the service of the local cardinal.  \\"Blackie\\" is requested to find the young television priest, Jean-Claude, who had disappeared during a TV shoot in the 3rd Century basement of Notre Dame.<br />Needing an interpreter, Bishop Blackie \\"stumbles\\" on Marie-Bernadette, an accomplished musician who is begging outside the Church of St. Germain. Greeley's fascination with thing Celtic (pronounced as KEL-tik) means that Marie-Bernadette's accomplishments are in Celtic music, whether from the Celtic region of France or the Basque region of Spain, or, of course, from Scotland and Ireland.  This makes a nice little sub-plot, with Bishop Blackie officiating at Marie-Bernadette's marriage at the end of the book.<br />Of course, Blackie solves the mystery of the disappearance of the television evangelist priest, Jean-Claude, and while doing so, Author Greeley comments on the loneliness of the celibate clergy, their trials and temptations.  I couldn't help wondering if there was some autobiographical issues buried in those comments.  The story's main plot had a nice little twist that I should have been able to catch earlier than I did!<br />Narrator George Guidall was again excellent.  I have listened to him as the voice of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee in the Tony Hillerman mysteries, and it is amazing how Mr. Guidall can range from \\"flat\\" Navajo tone in those books to an excited French accent for the exalted cardinal of Paris in this book.

Stoddard Publishing, Toronto, Canada, 2000.<br />This book recounts the experiences of T. W. H. Hewer as a young man and a wireless operator in the Royal Canadian Air Force. As a young teenager, Howard Hewer had dreams of flying Spitfires, so he enlisted in the Canadian Air Force, which decided, at that moment, they had a greater need for radio operators than for pilots. He was shipped to Calgary for training in radio operations. Hewer then tells the story of his training as an enlisted radio operator, and his experience during bombing raids on Nazi held Europe. He retired as Wing Commander.<br />Young Hewer was well aware of the cultural differences between the British and the Canadians. He devotes an entire chapter (Chapter 6, \\"Yatesbury Wireless School - Collision of Cultures) to describe the class-conscious Brits and the young Canadians being trained in England. Throughout the book, these cultural differences will pop up, and, in some instances, be of major importance. In Chapter 19, (A Fine Line To Mutiny), it would appear that the British wanted a level of discipline that neither the Australians nor the Canadians wanted to accept. Admittedly, it as an Australian who first threw down his rifle and refused to drill, but Hewer appears to have approved of the group's refusal to exercise and drill. He later implies that this \\"mutiny\\" was responsible for the delay of his commissioning as an officer.<br />This book is not just the usual recounting of the terrors of flying bombers into German held Europe. There is that, of course, but Hewer narrates a story that involves the European Theatre, flying to Malta, on to Egypt and then a trip, in a ship, around Africa. In South Africa, when warned to avoid certain down town areas because the Boers still remembered the Boer war and therefore were \\"hostile\\" to the British, Hewer relies on his \\"Canada\\" shoulder flash. He and a Canadian compatriot slip into a down town hotel and are feted by the old Boers with free beer and lunch.<br />An interesting anecdote related by Hewer deals with the dance halls. He was on a balcony and looked down at the dancers, who reminded him of a field of moving daisies. .

Terminal Event by James Stewart Thayer, Large Print, Beeler Large Print, Hampton Falls, NH, 2000.<br />This book opens with a horrific scene: former NTSB investigator, Joe Durant, is running towards an airplane crash and encountering parts of human bodies.  As a former National Transportation Safety Board investigator, Durant has seen many crashes, but this one is different: he knows that his wife was on Emerald Airlines plane called Sacajawea.<br />Author James Thayer then develops three major plot lines in the investigation into the cause(s) of the crash and each plot line depends upon the kind of people, the characters, involved.  The first centers on Joe Durant, the NTSB engineer, who develops an engineering theory based upon improper design or, perhaps, incorrect maintenance.  The second revolves around the FBI and ATF agents, who scour the Northwest part of the Untied States for skinhead groups who are anti-government enough to shoot down commercial airliners.  The third plot line introduces a Saudi Arabian prince, in the United States for treatment of alcoholism. His presence on the crashed plane is ascertained from identification of those attending funerals and memorial services, and determining why those individuals would be at these events.  All three plots compete and it seems, to the reader, that each competing cause is plausible: engineering failure, or terrorist attacks or assassination of the Saudi.  But then, not to give away the surprise ending,  the main protagonist , Joe Durant, discovers the one important clue that leads to the actual killer.<br />The discussion of technology is appropriate to this type of mystery, and the hint of romance, with the hotshot FBI agent,  Linda Dillon, serves to lighten the book.  Author James Thayer does know the Northwest part of the country.  Read the book to find out who dun it.	2003-01-30

Audio version (Five tapes) read by Robert Forester. New Millennium Audio, Beverly Hills, CA.<br />In short, staccato bursts of dialogue, Robert B. Parker tells the story of Chief of Police, Jesse Stone, in the small town of Paradise, north of Boston, Massachusetts.  Chief Stone had lost his police job in Los Angeles, lost his first wife and ended up in the small town of Paradise.  His experience in Minor League Baseball makes the Chief a star in the local softball league, and that's where the story begins.  The softball team's reverie after the early evening game is broken by the discovery of badly decomposed body floating in the lake.  The story then grows around Chief Stone's development of his tiny police force by instructing them, with on-the-job training, in big city police tactics.<br />The dead girl's family has disowned her; the girl had run away, and become part of a sex for pay group.  Stone shows his police officers how to act on routine (and boring) stakeouts and finally, he tracks down the murderer.  Throughout all of this, the author has interspersed tales of Stone's alcoholism, failure at married life and regrets with the injury that cost him a promising baseball career.  About three-quarters of the way through, you begin  suspecting  the identity of the killer, but these side issues in the life of Chief Stone continue to make the book interesting.<br />This book appears to be better if it is read aloud.  The audio version, read by Robert Forester, flowed naturally and rapidly.  Everything seemed to fit together as the book was read.  It certainly helped me in the traffic of I-495, around Boston.  Speaking of Boston, please let the reader know that the pronunciation  of Copely Square is  \\"COP-lee\\", not the \\"Cope -lee\\" used in this presentation.	2003-01-28

Subtitled: \\"The Mystery of St. Thomas Becket of Canterbury\\" .  Yale University Press, 1995.<br />St. Thomas a Becket opposed the actions of his king, Henry II, who \\"wished\\" that he was rid of that priest Some of Henry's knights dispatched Thomas in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170.  The burial place of St. Thomas a Becket then became a shrine that was the center of centuries of pilgrimages in England.  When another Henry, i.e. Henry VIII, decided to break with the Church in Rome, he made St. Thomas Becket an object lesson.  On page 117, the author, John Butler, records that Henry VIII viewed Thomas Becket as a \\"rebel\\" who fled to France and to the bishop of Rome \\"...to procure the abrogation of wholesome laws\\".  King Henry VIII ordered the \\"plucking down \\" of the pictures of St. Thomas Becket and that Becket would not be considered a saint \\"...throughout the realm\\".  An example of this pettiness, this meanness, is portrayed on page 118, where the painting of St. Thomas Becket has been scratched out completely.  This becomes the central theme of the book: were the Commissioners of Henry VIII so mean as to be able to disinter the bones of St. Thomas Becket and  burn them?  On page 119, the author quotes that \\" ...the Pope 'announced the new cruelty and impiety of the King of England, who commanded the body of St Thomas of Canterbury to be burnt and the ashes scattered to the winds\\".  The Commissioner who supposedly ordered the ashes to be fired from a cannon was Thomas Cromwell.  Interestingly, the author does not name the Pope, as usually done in historical works; it was Pope Paul III, (reigned from 1534 to 1549).  Also interestingly, in this present age of restitution, reparation and  restoration, this book  makes no mention of the move to restore to Roman Catholics the riches, the land and the churches stolen from Catholics in 1500s.<br />If the bones were not burnt, were they later discovered (1888)  in the place in Canterbury especially identified with Thomas Becket?  You will have to read the book to find the answer to that.  John Butler has taken historical facts and worked them into a book which reads like a mystery novel.

CD Audio Version read by Katherine Borowitz.<br />Kathy Reichs is well know for writing novels that employ her in-depth knowledge of forensic analysis to surprise, sometimes shock and often stimulate the reader.  The latest book, \\"Grave Secrets\\", however is like a large kitchen with too many cooks and too much to eat.  You snack something here and snicker something there and soon, you have lost the edge of your hunger, but you are NOT satisfied.<br />\\"Grave Secrets\\" begins with the assignment of Tempe Brennan to a burial site in a small village in Guatemala where government death squads have killed all the women and children, Brennan's assignment is to document the deaths, the mode(s) of killing and the calendar time of death.  Some of her co-workers are killed in an ambush, and this later appears to be an assassination attempt on Tempe Brennan.  In the middle of this, because of her experience and her writing of papers on the subject, Brennan is asked to assist in the exhumation and identification of human remains in a septic system.  Then, the over-sexed Canadian ambassador to Guatemala appears to be involved and his daughter is missing.  Tempe flies back to Montreal with the Ambassador's wife, where the missing daughter has been found, but, in my opinion, this visit to Montreal really does not advance the plot.  The trip does permit Tempe to meet with Andrew Ryan, a romantic interest.<br />The next plot line involves stem cell research, and there is a substantial tutorial on embryonic stem cell research and the potential for help to victims of diseases such as Parkinson's.  At least twice, the author has her characters describe President George W. Bush's decision on limiting stem cell \\"lines' as wrong.  Finally, in the next to last chapter after an unbecoming description of an attack of diaherra (where later proves to be caused by drugs slipped into a soda can), Tempe Brennan resolves all the plot lines.  The last chapter is tinged with romance as Tempe tries to decide between Andrew Ryan and a Spanish version, nicknamed \\"The Bat\\", who had gone to college with Andrew Ryan.<br />There was just too much going on, too quick a resolution of the twisted plot lines and then, the novel changed from a mystery \\"who dun it\\" into a romance.  The overall book did not satisfy me.  The reader, Katherine Borowitz, was excellent and handled both the French names in Montreal and the Spanish names in Guatemala City with appropriate accents.

Irwin, sub-titled \\"A Teenage Tank gunner Come of Age in Combat-1945.\\" Random House, New York, 2002.<br />With the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944, there was a great demand on the United States Army for replacements in the European Theater of Operations. Pennsylvanian John P. Irwin had just completed tank gunner training in Fort Knox and was shipped to France. He was immediately put in charge, as ranking soldier, of a Sherman tank, and, after completing repairs, instructed to join up with the 3rd Armored Division. Running as a single tank, trying to catch the main column, Irwin and his crew promptly get lost. They end up in a German occupied town, and, happily for them, the Germans want to surrender. Corporal Irwin leads the German column back to American lines, where he is chewed out by Captain Harker for delivering unwanted prisoners! Thus begins Irwin's tour of duty in the closing period of World War II in Europe.<br />His book describes the relations among the five-man crew, the agony of having a tank shot out from underneath them, and the daily drudgery in going from town to town, river to river, bridge to bridge. Their replacement tank is one of the new Pershing Tanks, and Irwin describes how the Pershing's extra armor, its ability to fire while still moving and the Pershing's rapid gun turret movement saved them in many situations.

Marlowe & Company, New York, 1999.<br />According to her \\"Introduction\\", Anneli Rufus was a Jewish child who was always intrigued by the practice of the collection and veneration of relics in the Christian church.  As a child, she liked to read the Lives of the Saints.  Her book is not just an unbeliever's examination of the idiosyncrasies of the Faithful in the belief in the efficacy of relics.  Her writing is so unbecoming that it borders, in my opinion, on being nasty. In her first chapter, \\"So Many Maidens\\", on St. Ursula and the 11,000 Virgins, she writes about the maidens:  \\"...so much long silky hair and so many quarts of menstrual blood\\".  (Page 12).  Unbecoming!  In writers' conferences, I have been taught that every written word should advance  your central theme.  What do \\"...quarts of menstrual blood\\" have to do with incorruptible corpses scattered as relics a round Europe?  Where was the author's editor?  Nasty.<br />This tone of writing continues throughout.  Later in the book the author describes being assailed by bad breath in one church.  Personally, I have encountered bad breath on the subways of NYC and in the underground of London, but I do not think that descriptions of these encounters would advance a written travelogue on these two tourist cities.  In describing the clothes tourists wear, the author makes a case for some formal tourist dress code,  particularly, perhaps, for American tourists, but, then again, does this advance the central theme of the book?  What does the dress of the visitors has to do with the practice of dismembering the bodies of Saints so that  each little village can have their own relic?  Where was the editor?<br />Henry VIII beheaded St. Thomas More (1478-1531).  More's body is buried under the chapel at the Tower of London.  His head was stuck on a pike for all to see, but his daughter lovingly took the head away in the dark of night.  Anneli Rufus might have written a better book if she had spent her time documenting where the head of  this English Saint is rather than writing about menstrual blood, bad breath and graffiti.  For the reader truly interested in the strange phenomenon of  bodies that do not decay, along with practice of venerating such saintly relics, I would recommend the book, \\"The Incorruptibles\\", by  Joan C.

A Tom Doherty Associates Book, New York, May 2001, but first copyrighted in 1960.<br />According to the fronts piece, this is a work of fiction based upon the experiences of the noted writer, Richard Matheson, when he was shipped as an 18-year-old replacement into the European Theater of Operations in late 1944.  Matheson portrays the development of Private Hackermeyer from a stumbling, inexperienced and frightened young soldier to a competent killer, who ignores the surrendering gestures of German soldiers.  He has become so proficient in shooting his M-1, that Hackermeyer automatically registers on the target, pulls the trigger and then begins to scan for more.<br />Although written as fiction, there are two separate analyses of the wisdom of using young men as soldiers; these analyses are couched in dialogue among squad members.  (Sergeant Cooley  states, \\"I ain't running a rifle squad, ...I'm running a kindergarten.\\")  There is also some discussion about life after death, resulting in Hackermeyer's introspection on that subject, on the death of his mother, and on life back in Brooklyn, NY.<br />The writing is excellent and Richard Matheson vividly establishes the range of feelings among the young soldiers, ranging from absolute terror to complacent acceptance, during the various attacks and defensive actions that take place in a very short calendar time.  In my opinion, Matheson has captured day to day combat better than most writers.	2002-12-28

Sub-titled \\"Life and Death in the Last days of WWII.  Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2001.<br />This is a well-written story of a young man who had just finished his first year at the University of Michigan and was drafted,in February 1943.  Leo Litwak was assigned to the medical corps with initial training with a detachment in South Carolina.  The book covers the time from this training to his arrival in European Theater of Operations (EOT) in November 1944,  until the end of the war.  At the very end of his time in Europe, he recounts how his unit had to turn over the village (made-up name of \\"Grossdorf\\") to the Russians as it was on Soviet side of the occupation line.  Litwak had studied a little German, so he was able to  communicate in \\"bare-bones German\\" (P. 137) with not only the people in the occupied towns but also with the survivors of nearby concentration camps.  The author devotes  a long chapter to his assignation , while on leave in Paris (1945)  with the hooker, Marishka, but the writing  is done in a sensitive and quiet way.<br />Litwak's writing is generally excellent:  Page 115, example \\"  ...German Soldiers, whom we once considered awesome predators - well clad, well armed, well disciplined, red in tooth and claw\\".  Now, as prisoners, the Germans were \\"... flock animals, indistinguishable from each other\\".  The author has also done a good job of capturing the constant use of profanity in routine conversations in the military.  There is profanity in the book, but not near as much as you would encounter in daily conversations.  When I served in the  U. S. Navy in the late 1950s,  the sailors would answer affirmatively by saying, \\"F---ing `A'!\\", not just a simple \\"Yes!\\".  My son served in the Marine Corps in the early 1990s, and he reports that the same amount of profanity was used.  The author has included just enough profanity to capture the essence of  routine military dialogue.<br />Finally, Leo Litwak ends the book with a summary that many probably felt,  (Page 225):  \\" Now I wanted us to be scattered and never reassembled.  No more armies or divisions or regiments or battalions  ...  No veterans' groups, no reunions, no visits to old battlefields  ... Let that all be in the past, cleansed by recollection.\\"book with a summary that many probably felt,  (Page 225):  \\" Now I wanted us to be scattered and never reassembled.

Alfred A. Knopf, 2002.<br /> Due to the subject matter, this is a tough book to read.  Richard Rhodes has documented, in explicit detail, the killing of more than 20 million human beings by Nazi Germany.  For almost all of them, their only crime was to be \\"Untermensch\\", or sub-human, according to the Nazi definition.  Rhodes notes that  twice as many Slavs ( 3 million Poles, 7 million Soviet citizens and 3.3 million Soviet POWs ) were killed than were Jews. (Page 157).  The Jews were, however, the main target, with grandiose Nazi plans for the elimination of 700,000 Jews in unoccupied France, 330,000 in England and the even the 4000 Jews who lived in Ireland. (page 237)  The Nazi plan was to empty the eastern steppes of the indigenous Slavs and re-settle Germans there.  Adolph Hitler identified  \\"...Stalin's communism  ..[as] ...a new form of Russian imperialism\\"  (Page 86)  and the resettlement of the Germans in the East would form a barrier against  the ancient enemy.<br /> The first few chapters developed  a psychological  theory of the bully-murderer and how that cruel personality type was not only legitimatized but also became the norm in the SS groups.  The author has made Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) the central character in the book's development of the evolution of the killing methods. Himmler could not live up to his own ideals of the SS hero.  The shooting of an actual person, \\"up close and personal\\",  was too much for Himmler's weak stomach and, this, coupled with the economy of mass murder, led to the introduction of the gas chambers.  Impersonal killing had been instituted in the Third Reich with the physician-assisted killing of the handicapped German children in the Autumn of 1939 (page 154).  Some of the chapters are especially difficult with German reports, enumerating the killing of so many Jews, here in this  town and in that city, and the pages flow into an accountant's recital, when it is human lives being considered.  The author brings it all to life by identifying each reporting officer and noting that  numbers were \\"absurdly precise\\".<br />  Rhodes does stumble here and there.  As noted in other Amazon reviews,  he has the U.S. declaring war on Germany, when, historically, Germany went first and then, Congress, not Roosevelt, declared war on Germany.  In the note on page 125, he applies the term, \\"An inflated reference to Stalin's partisan order\\" concerning that \\"... the Russian side had ordered to have the SS members and Party members shot \\" ... when these Germans were taken prisoner.  I do not know why he terms this \\"an inflated reference\\"  as all German prisoners were being shot out of hand,  so quickly that Soviet officers had to give orders to hold them for interrogation.  (See \\"The Wehrmacht War Crimes Bureau, 1939-1945\\" by Alfred-Maurice De Zayas).  Finally, SS-Gruppenfueher Max Thomas was first introduced on page 163.  The author could have told us more about an individual  who \\"...was a doctor by profession\\"  and  had such an obviously English name.

The author attempted a more or less complete history of technology development and its impact in all the warring nations of World War II.  The resultant volume is almost an Anglophile book, emphasizing more the war between the Western Allies and the Nazis. History is not only the material being included but also by whatever is excluded; Shachtman tends to include the efforts and counter-measures of the Anglo-Americans against the Germans. Often excluded are the successes in the Pacific Theatre. For example, at the commencement of hostilities, the Japanese Imperial Navy had an advantage in night fighting over the American navy.  When radar was introduced to American ships, night fighting advantage swung to the Americans. This important story is not really covered in this book. In a similar fashion, the struggle for air superiority in the Pacific was a major technological success for the Americans. The Mitsubishi Zero fighter permitted Japan to dominate the early war in the Pacific.  Then, the efforts of Grumman Aviation, Long Island, NY, as an example, in developing the Wildcat countered the advantage of the Japanese Zero. This story would be enough for a book in itself.  On page 111, Shachtman notes that the Dutch government ordered \\"...its two radar experts to flee to Great Britain\\".  Why not give the names of these two Dutchmen? And why not edit out the in fighting in England where one Englishman was made a lord and the other was insulted? Who cares? The major technological advance and change from marvel into a terror was, of course, the development of the atomic bomb.  This effort has been documented so well in other books, that the author does not pay enough attention (in my opinion) to the success of the Manhattan Project and the use of the A-bomb.<br />I found this book difficult to read.  The book is generally in chronological order, but the author uses \\"white spaces\\" as the simple expedient to signal a subject change.  This results in the reader's attention being focused on a subject, and then, in the next paragraph, you have jumped from guided missile rocketry to the Katyn Forest massacre of Polish officers by the Soviets.

Illustrated by Giulio Maestro.  Sub-titled, \\"A Feast of Homonym Riddles\\".  Clarion Books, 1982.<br />This book plays on the wealth of homonyms (words which sound alike but mean different things) in the English language.  First, a question, (i.e. a riddle) is asked, and then the answer, dependent upon a homonym, is given.  For example, on the back cover, the riddle is: \\"What do you call a smelly chicken?\\"<br />Answer, playing on the homonyms: \\"A foul fowl!\\"<br />The entire book is filled with this type of word play: the riddle, with the answer in homonyms nicely illustrated by Giulio Maestro.  All of the clever use of words makes for  funny reading aloud. The illustrations keep the attention of the children who are too young read, even though they may not fully understand the joke embedded in the homonyms.  This book is a worthwhile addition to the library of the young reader.	2002-10-05

Tuchman, sub-titled \\"Selected Essays\\".  Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., New York, 1981.<br />This book is a collection of essays written by the noted Historian, Barbara W. Tuchman (e.g. \\"The Guns of August\\"), over the course of her long career.  In my humble opinion, for the novice historian, the most interesting essays are, \\"The Historian as Artist\\" (pages 45-50), \\"The Historian's Opportunity\\", (pages 51-64).  In these two essays, Ms. Tuchman challenges the budding historian to not only collect facts, dates and events, but rather to write History so the end product is as engaging as modern novel, BUT, based upon excellent scholarship. Ms. Tuchman is a proponent of \\"narrative\\" History, where the facts \\"...require arrangement, composition planning just like a painting - Rembrandt's 'Night Watch`\\" (page 49). These two essays would enhance any course in Historiography.<br />Some of her remaining essays are a bit dated, but provide keen insight into the times, as in Tuchman's \\"Japan: A Clinical Note\\", (pages 93-97).  Her essays on Israel tend to be a bit chauvinistic, in the sense that  the author's objectivity slips and she can find very little wrong with the budding Jewish state in what was once Palestine.  The essay, \\"Perdicaris Alive or Rasuli Dead\\" (pages 104-117), is very entertaining, particularly if you are interested in New York's Teddy Roosevelt.  All in all, the first section of this book, (called \\"The Craft\\"), includes essays that should be required reading for a student beginning graduate work in History.	2002-09-16

The Wailing Wind by Tony Hillerman, Copyright 2002, Harper Audio Books, 4 Cassettes, read by George Guidall.<br />Tony Hillerman has reached a new pinnacle in his writing, as he deals with three distinct protagonists in this murder mystery.  There is the old hand, the legendary Lieutant Leaphorn  (sort of retired), the up and coming middle manager in Jim Chee and the rookie in Officer Bernadette Manuelito.  Each of them plays a significant part in the solving of the mystery of the missing wife, Linda Denton.<br /> The central mystery, however, is the missing Golden Calf mine, sought for years by the gruff and somewhat eccentric millionaire, Wiley Denton.  The book opens with Officer Manuelito discovering a dead body in the cab of a pick-up truck.  It is obvious that the murder did not occur at the trucks location, and Officer Bernadette is in trouble with the FBI (it is a new agent this time) for disturbing the crime scene.  Manuelito is suspended and she spends that time tracking down the place where the crime actually took place ... which is probably the location of the Golden Calf.<br /> Tony Hillerman has all three characters contributing to the solution of the murder, the Golden Calf and to the discovery of the missing wife, Linda Denton.  Early on, you get an inkling of what happened to Mrs. Denton, and as you progress through the book, your worst fears are confirmed.  But, even as you go along, you say Oh no! Hillerman would never write that!  It is too horrible.<br /> Again, George Guidall displays excellent characterization, with his voice rising and falling as required by the wide range of characters.  This book helped immensely as I commuted on I-495, the ring road around Boston.	2002-08-24

F.X. Schouppe, S.J. Tan Books, Rockford, Illinois.<br />This book received its IMPRIMATUR on October 11, 1893, so these writings of the Jesuit priest, F.X. Schouppe, are more than a century old.  Fr. Schouppe collected and compiled the descriptions of Purgatory as recorded in the lives of saints and various holy people. Some of the saints are well known (St. Catherine of Genoa and St. Gertrude) while others are less familiar, e.g. St. Odilo, or, for example, Blessed Stephana Quinziani.  The book is divided into two parts, \\"Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Justice\\" and \\"Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Mercy\\".  If you read only the first part, it would, in my opinion, be very easy to lose hope. The suffering of the souls in Purgatory is real and they suffer for great things and for the least little offense. The Foreword, selected from St. Matthew's Gospel, makes Fr. Schouppe's point,<br />  \\"... that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render<br />  an account for it in the day of judgment\\" Matt. 12:36.<br />The second part of the book, written, you will recall, before the 20th Century St. Faustina was born, is called \\"Purgatory: the Mystery Of God's Mercy\\" and the good Jesuit author makes the point that God's charity will not be out done.  In this second part of the book, as in the first, the author relates examples of \\"... how efficacious are the smallest prayers, the shortest supplications, to alleviate the sufferings of the poor souls\\".  P.237.  Schouppe gives examples of the efficacy of, first of all, The Mass, and then, the Rosary and the Stations of the Cross, in the relief of the suffering of souls in Purgatory.  This book presents some frightening aspects of the punishment in Purgatory, thereby providing motivation for good works in this life and the earning of indulgences.<br />Read this book to learn about Purgatory, the place.	2002-08-15

Because of its historical roots in both the Germanic and Latin branches of the Indo-European language family, the English language is rich in homonyms.  Fred Gwynne, the noted TV actor, plays upon \\"reign\\", (from Latin/French roots, and meaning to rule), and the word \\"rain\\", from the Old Anglo-Saxon, and meaning  \\"water dropping from the heavens\\". His front cover shows a king in ermine robes contentedly raining on the countryside, while a young girl, with an umbrella, gazes up at the ruler.  This kind of thing continues through the book, making every page funny and interesting.<br />The illustrations are colorfully done in what appears to be pastel chalks, and Fred Gwynne has probably included some autobiographical drawings as, for example,  the Daddy with the mole on his nose is easily recognizable as the TV actor. This book is nicely illustrated and will provide many hours of reading enjoyment and learning.<br />Personally, I found that the child-reader has to be in the first or second grade, or at least fairly well exposed to the nuances of the English language, or else the play on words, using homonyms, will be lost.  The younger children appeared to be interested in the illustrations alone, which are stand-alone funny.	2002-08-13

Book's subtitle is \\"An Interview With Maria Simma\\".  Queenship Publishing company, Goleta, CA 1997.<br />This is a very short (58 pages) book, relating the interview of Maria Simma, a devout Catholic, who, for many years, has visits from the souls in Purgatory. These souls will ask Maria Simma to have prayers said for them: a Mass, or a Rosary, or the Stations of the Cross. The author, Sister Emmanuel, interviewed Maria Simma through an interpreter, and,\\" for the sake of brevity and clarity\\" (page 3), Sister Emmanuel summed up some of Maria's answers.<br />This book is not a summary of the Church's doctrine on the issue of Purgatory. Rather, the book recounts the answers of Maria Simma to the questions asked by Sister Emmanuel.  That Maria Simma has been visited by the souls from Purgatory is confirmed by incidents (not fully documented in this book) of a deceased person relating details to Maria Simma, and her telling the family of the deceased these details.  Maria would have all the details concerning the field, or the exact amount of money, or the property and...\\"the family would be staggered to discover that she knew all these details\\".  (p. 38)<br />For anyone wanting to discover what Purgatory is like, this small book gives a description  of that place by one woman who has had visions for most of her life.  Maria must be approaching her 90s, since she was listed as 82 in the year of publication (1997).<br />The last few pages are a call to prayer for the souls in Purgatory by the author, Sister Emmanuel.  The book is well worth the small price, and ... delivered the book quickly.	2002-07-24

Harry N. Abrams, Publishers, New York, 2001.<br />This is an elegantly bound book, with spectacular photos of the 18th century crib created by the leading artists of the then Kingdom of Naples. This small book will make an excellent stocking stuffer. The Photographer, Elliot Erwitt,  has done a wonderful job of catching all the miniature details of the multitude of figurines used in the crib (or cr&egrave;che, as the book calls it).<br />Although you are told that the figures are \\"...no more than twenty inches high\\", it is not until you reach the last photo of the book, displaying the cr&egrave;che on a table top, that you fully realize how small the entire scene is.  Then, you begin to get an inkling of  the amount of work the photographer has done to capture the exquisite beauty of each tiny piece.<br />For me, the overall book is marred by the choice of Gospel texts from the King James Version.  For members of the largest Christian church in the United States, the King James Version is not acceptable.  Further, the King James Version has blatant errors, such as (see page 19 in this tiny book), Luke 2.13,14, which reads, \\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\\".

NORTON & COMPANY, New York, 1961.<br />After having read \\"Colditz\\" by Henry Chancellor, I had to search out Reinhold Eggers' book in the Hingham Public Library.  Reinhold Eggers was a German officer who had his native German, plus English and French as languages; thus his assignment to deal with Allied POWs.  He was in his fifties during the time period of this book, so he did not see much combat in the Second World War.  Eggers gives an even-handed, fair recounting of the events at the prison camp, Colditz Castle, where recalcitrant Allied prisoners were kept.  The idea was that the worst offenders, those POWs who had attempted too many escapes, would be kept safe and sound in escape-proof Colditz Castle in eastern Germany.  Of course, there were many escapes, and some POWs actually made it to neutral territory or back to Allied control.  In each case, the author attempts to explain what happened or what went wrong. He also references later works of others, which explain what actually had happened.<br />At Colditz, Reinhold Eggers was one of the German officers who worked for exact correctness in dealing with Allied POWs, and, sometimes in the book, you can sense his regret that the various nationalities rarely reciprocated this correctness.  Page 75, \\"The indiscipline in the camp never ceased to have its effect in the cold war between staff and prisoners.\\" Page 124: \\"The Poles seethed with hatred of us, but in Colditz their behaviour was exemplary\\".  You can also sense the dislike or at least the distaste that Eggers has for the Nazi \\"Partei\\".  At Colditz, there were very few Americans, so they are mentioned only briefly towards the back of the book.<br />The book is a well-translated volume, in almost scholarly tone, which might reflect the way the book was originally written in German.  The translation was very good, with the only exception being on page 39: \\"Sentries were unsighted at one or two spots\\". I believe the translator meant, \\"Sentries were out of sight, at one or two spots\\". If you have read other books on Colditz Castle, it is worth your effort to search out and read \\"The German Side of the Story\\".at one or two spots\\". I believe the translator meant, \\"Sentries were out of sight, at one or two spots\\".

Read by Bernard Mayes.  Eight 1-½ hour cassettes.<br />This is a remarkable story of suffering, endurance, perseverance and loyalty. Slavomir Rawicz was a cavalry officer in the Polish Army when Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia divided Poland. Arrested by the Soviets in 1939, Rawicz was put on \\"trial\\" for espionage against the Soviet Union, mainly on the grounds that Rawicz spoke Russian.  Why else would a Pole learn Russian ... obviously to spy!  Convicted, he is sent to a labor camp in Siberia.  Usually, this is enough for good story.  The Polish cavalry officer, however, after enduring the hardships of walking, in a raging blizzard, from the railhead to the labor camp, decides to escape.<br />With a little help from the wife of the Camp Commander, Rawicz escapes with six other prisoners, along with a makeshift knife and an ax head without a handle.  They walk out of Siberia in the \\"warm\\" part of the year, meet a displaced Polish woman (almost a young girl) and include her in their plans.<br />Their plans include walking along the side of the biggest lake in the world, crossing the Gobi dessert without a vessel to carry water, climbing through the Himalayas (without oxygen at heights where it was needed) and finally coming out in British India.  The lone American (identified only as Mr. Smith) then uses his command of English to explain their great trek to the British Army.  It is almost impossible to believe all the hardships they must endure.  They survive the Gobi by eating large black snakes, and the butchering and cooking is described too graphically.  They meet various native individuals, and are greeted courteously and sometimes charmingly, despite the lack, sometimes, of a language in common.<br />The young girl dies in the Gobi.  The Pole, who sang Christmas carols on Christmas Eve, falls to his death in the mountains.  All the escapees lose much weight and they all grow beards and much hair, so that, when they are being medically treated in India, they are surprised to see what each other looks like. After hospitalization, Slavomir Rawicz arranges to be transferred to a Polish outfit fighting in Africa. The entire account is presented in a matter-of-fact fashion; the reader, Bernard Mayes echoes this by using uses a matter-of-fact , almost British accent, when he read the long book.  The eight cassettes helped me as I sat in traffic on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston.nd they all grow beards and much hair, so that, when they are being medically treated in India, they are surprised to see what each other looks like.

Putnam' Sons, New York, 1980.<br />There are three themes to this book: (1) Personal Memoir (2) Refutation of Strategic Bombing and (3) Experiences of Anti-Semitism. On the first level, this is the personal story of Elmer Bendiner as a navigator in a B17 during the crucial campaign year of 1943.  Mr. Bendiner relates how he became a navigator, the inconsistencies of life in the Army Air Corps and the difficulties of flying to bomb an enemy target.  His writing has a light tone, almost forgiving, even when he discusses critical incidents, such as his pilot aborting too many times.<br />The second theme begins the book, as E. Bendiner recounts the mission against Schweinfurt, August 17, 1943.  Then, throughout the book, Mr. Bendiner develops a case against strategic bombing, even though, at the time, it appeared logical to strike the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt ...and all the other targets that were indispensable for the German war effort. He even quotes Albert Speer, Hitler's Minister for Production, to show that strategic bombing was not as effective as the generals were claiming.<br />Finally, the third theme, Anti-Semitism, is implicit through out the book.  Bendiner first became aware of it when, as young boy, he lived in the \\"...Appalachian isolation of ...Pennsylvania\\" and the Ku Klux Klan had as ritualistic enemies a \\"...handful of Jews, Catholics and very few blacks.\\"  (P. 30). You slowly become aware that Mr. Bendiner is Jewish.  He even makes light of this when he relates that his \\"...Armenian friend, the son of a Christian minister but blessed with an aquiline nose of majestic proportions\\" bore the brunt of the anti-Semite jokes. (P. 37)  It is only at the end of the book that you realize how important being Jewish was to E. Bendiner, as he describes walking away from an officer who had insulted \\"your people\\".<br />This is an excellent book, well written and a worthy personal story that documents the experiences of one man in the Army Air Corps of World War II.ents the experiences of one man in the Army Air Corps of World War II.	2002-05-09

Then, in this day of Political Correctness, Patterson develops a team of four women, (one of whom is black) to deal with all the evidence some of which is planted.  All of this becomes implausible.  For example, the woman's team has the hardest time getting the draft copy of one of the first novels that the suspect has written.  This draft of the first novel becomes a key issue, as it is a blueprint for the murders.  Then, out of the clear blue, the author has Warren Jacoby, the police partner of the chief protagonist, Inspector Lindsay Boxer, making causal comments on the novel he had read.  Seems there were multiple copies available!  Too many twists, and the motivation for the killer to do all these Wedding Day Killings is not really, truly developed.<br />The reader of the audio version, Melissa Leo, does a fine job in characterization of all the major female personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors.  I enjoyed this audio book as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston, in my daily commute.	2002-05-07

George Clare was born as Georg Klaar in Vienna before the Nazi take-over. As a young man, he saw the \\"Anschluss\\" and the end of Austria as an independent country.  His father worked to get visas for emigration to the Republic of Ireland (the Irish Free State, as Mr. Clare then termed it), but things were fouled up and the family of father, mother and son were stuck in Nazi Germany's capital, Berlin.  Clare uses this stay as a basis for comparison when he returns to bombed-out Berlin, after the war.<br />In a poignant passage, the author remarks on the lack of noise in cold and windy post-war Berlin, where once he had heard the noise and sounds of a busy city.  Much of the front of the book is devoted to his memories of this bombed-out city becoming alive as he works in the British occupying forces.  The details of simple breakfast, when the Berliners were going hungry (if not starving) and the details of the deference given a British uniform during a subway rush hour, mundane as it would seem, brings alive the occupation of Berlin.  You had to be there to write out such recollections. Clare's writing is excellent.<br />Towards the end of the book, the author semi-analyzes Nazi Germany and its cousin state, Austria.  He quotes Primo Levi in saying that the Germans were lacking the courage to speak out against the concentration camps. Clare speaks of Goethe and Schiller strolling the woods where \\"... the SS implanted the hell it called Buchenwald\\". (p. 275). Clare doubts that A. Hitler, in 1928, when he was dictating \\"Mein Kampf\\", \\"..could have had the Final Solution in his conscious mind\\", (p. 277)  but, clearly, from the paragraphs just preceding, Clare shows, by recounting Hitler's acquiescence to the killing of 380 Jews, that Hitler knew what was happening.  Read the book just for this section alone.<br />This is an excellent book, well written and a worthy personal story that documents the history of the few years between the end of the war and the building of wall.nce to the killing of 380 Jews, that Hitler knew what was happening.

William Morrow, 2001.<br />This is a lengthy and well-documented book, telling the story of the \\"recalcitrant\\" Allied prisoners who were remanded to Colditz Castle in eastern Germany during World War II.  The purpose of using Colditz castle as a prison camp was, as is well known, to provide a camp from which no prisoner could escape.  As a last resort, \\"recalcitrant\\" prisoners, who had already shown a strong inclination to escape from other camps of the Nazis, were transferred to Colditz, deep in the eastern reaches of the Reich.  The theory was that the prisoners could not get out of the high castle and, even if they did, they had great distances between them and freedom.  Of course, all these efforts did not work, and Henry Chancellor spins 391 pages of the tales of the many different escape schemes.  He devotes an Appendix, of eleven pages, to listing the names of he prisoners who attempted to escape , their methods, and the results.  Overall, Mr. Chancellor lists \\"...316 officers involved in 174 attempts\\"... with 32 successful escapes, i.e. reaching freedom in neutral or Allied countries.  Perhaps the most unbelievable scheme was the actual construction of a glider in the chapel attic, for escape by using the winds caused by the castle's location in the mountains.  Chancellor documents this effort with photographs of the actual glider.<br />The book is an even-handed treatment of  all nationalities involved; the author even-goes so far as to interviewing the German guards who served at Colditz.  Polish POWs were first imprisoned at Colditz castle, and then, along with the fortunes of war, came French and British officers.  Much of the story is about these three groups.  Years ago, as a young boy, I had read Paul Brickhill's \\"The Great Escape\\", and I was later surprised by the (artistic license)changes made in the picture of the same name.  In this book, however, Americans are noted, but Americans played a minor role as they arrived too late in the war for any escape attempts.<br />Since this book is based upon a television documentary, there are three batches of interesting photos.

Scholastic, 2000.<br />Sam Williams has written about the Teddy Bear's hunt for the perfect Christmas Tree.  They are helped on their way by cooperative Snowmen as a pair of raccoons, in woolen winter caps, run by.  The reader is encouraged to help the sleigh (with the perfect tree), slide down the hill. Then, the book's centerpiece pops up to a beautifully trimmed tree and the next page shows Santa alighting on the Bears' roof.  The book is nicely illustrated with blues and violets on the outdoor scenes while warm yellows, reds and oranges dominate the indoor pictures.  The illustrator and the author have produced a book to remember.<br />Five stars would have been assigned if the moving \\"pull-the-tab\\" items were more sturdy.<br />I have three grandsons, and, in my humble opinion, the young boys are rougher on books than are young girls.  So, on the page where the Snowmen help the Teddy Bears, the young boys tend to pull the sleigh up and down too quickly, with the result that the paper rips.  Further, there is a note, in small print, that warns you, \\" Before turning the page, push the sleigh back up to its starting position\\".  Adults might push the sleigh up, but children tend to want to turn the page to continue with the story.  You have to be careful on some pages of this book so that you do not crumple the moving items. The book is, however, an ideal way to keep young children busy while Christmas preparations occupy the adults of the family.	2002-04-03

Although the Grandfather, Jeorg Frick, is now an American citizen, he was a born in Germany (Deutschland) and drafted into the Wehrmacht when he was young. The author then has the grandfather recounting his experiences of war, along with much of the horrors, to his young grandson. The book begins with the young boy visiting his Great-grandfather and seeing that the old man can really shot!  One thing leads to another, and then the Grandfather decides to tell the young boy about the German Army medals and the collection of war memorabilia.<br />On this foundation, the writer, Tim Erenberger, spins a tale of German soldier fighting his way through many of the major battles of the Second World War.  The point of view is that of a drafted German, who would have been content to stay at home in a bakery, but  who is discovered to have a natural ability for marksmanship.  The author puts this Grandfather in the invasion of Poland (September 1, 1939), and then into the elite German paratroops, has him land on the Belgian fortress of Eben Emael (May 10, 1940), and continue through France, drop in on Crete (where the German paratroops were cut to pieces) and to the war in Russia.  In the main portion of the book, as the German Panzer forces crash through the great breadth of Mother Russia, the book slows down, in continuous but similar action, killing here, advancing, and then shooting more there.  After the effects of the first winter in Russia, the book again seems to go through much the same, as the Germans fight much the same battle after battle, when they retreat out of immense frozen Russian landscape.<br />Timothy Erenberger has accomplished a major feat here: his book is a believable depiction of the common soldier's life as he fights his way back and forth over much of Europe, against American, Belgian, British, French, and Russian soldiers.  Only three stars were awarded, as this book has a few obvious errors (such as the Battle of the Bulge beginning on December 6th 1994, instead of December 16th), which would have been cleaned up by an astute and knowledge editor. For example, page 372 has opened the parenthesis on  (Commonly called a \\"Luger\\"), but the parentheses are not closed in the book.  An astute editor would have known that the 30-caliber ammunition for an American M1 rifle would not fit the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR), which takes 45 caliber.  Even a German soldier on the run would be able to notice such a difference.  Little things, such as these, slow down the enjoyment of the book.  I purchased this book from Amazon, for my son, a former Marine, who enjoyed the book. All in all, this book packs many of the horrific experiences that a German soldier probably had, fighting in World War II.ajor feat here: his book is a believable depiction of the common soldier's life as he fights his way back and forth over much of Europe, against American, Belgian, British, French, and Russian soldiers.

The book is presented from the viewpoint of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.  The book does deal peripherally with Confederate generals Longstreet, A.P. Hill, cavalry general Jeb Stuart, but all from the view of how they interacted with Jackson, or laid the path for actions and battles in which Stonewall Jackson was involved.  On the Union side, the chief protagonist is General Winfield Scott Hancock and accordingly he receives more attention than, say, Union General Joshua Chamberlain (the hero of Gettysburg) or Irish Brigade General Thomas Meagher (pronounced MAAhar). In fact, this is one of the few books not explicitly addressing the Irish Brigade that actually gives credit to that general and his famous Civil War outfit for its bravery at places such as Antietam and Fredericksburg.<br />Stonewall Jackson is described as leaving his teaching position at Virginia Military Institute, but bringing most of the cadet corps with him to serve in the newly forming Confederate army.  A brief interlude describes how Jackson earned the name of \\"Stonewall\\" at the Battle of Bull Run, July 1861, and how that name stuck with him.  (I wonder why Shaara did not describe the Fighting 69th, the core of Irish Brigade at Bull Run?  That New York outfit was one of the few Union groups to retire from the field in order.)  The book then deals with change in leadership of the Army of Potomac, and the errors the Union generals made at Antietam and Fredericksburg.<br />The audio book builds up the tension until the darkness of the Battle of Chancellorsville, where Stonewall Jackson was shot by Southern troops.  Shaara ascribes a poignant quote to General Lee, who wrote to Jackson that, \\"...you may have lost your left arm, but I have lost my right\\".  Many historians think that the Civil War would have been greatly different, or, at least, much longer, if the team of Lee and Jackson had been able to collaborate on defeating the different commanding generals that President Lincoln put in charge of the Army of Potomac.  Just as an aside, the Western Theatre is hardly mentioned, so, naturally, the name of U.S. Grant is not mentioned either.<br />The audio book's reader failed to develop a true Southern accent with which he tried to characterize the Confederate generals.  Thus, when he came to dialogue assigned to Robert E. Lee, the reader lowered his voice to a quiet tone, which, along with the Southern drawl, made the character appear, to my ears, effeminate as opposed to a voice of a commanding general.ave been greatly different, or, at least, much longer, if the team of Lee and Jackson had been able to collaborate on defeating the different commanding generals that President Lincoln put in charge of the Army of Potomac.

Subtitled, \\"How A Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed The Way Everyone Thinks and Feels\\".  Audio book read by Richard M. Davidson, Recorded Books, Inc, 1998.<br />The central thesis of Cahill's book is that monotheism was introduced through the Jews. From this first incidence of monotheism, in recorded history, flows a personal relationship with God, and from this personal relationship comes a personal responsibility for oneself, one's relations with neighbors and one's outlook on history itself.  Cahill records the personal development, (dare it be termed \\"evolution\\"?) of this concept from Abraham and Sarah through Isaac, to Samuel, to David and so on.  With each important biblical character, the author examines some aspect of the roots of what we consider Western individuality: personal responsibility, personal conscience, personal culpability of humans in this worldwide picture.  All of this can be traced to the monotheism of the Jews.<br />Almost forty years ago, even though I was studying engineering, we were required to take courses in theology.  The importance of the Jews to monotheism was covered in freshman year. Having accepted this concept back in my college days (many years ago!), I was surprised that Thomas Cahill thought it necessary to write a book on the subject.  He has excellent writing ability, but I think that he knows that he was \\"preaching to the choir\\", i.e. writing this book for Jews and Christians already convinced of the importance of the Jews in history.  Is he writing for the Muslim world?  His use of King James version of the English bible is an indication of his target audience.  In the United States, Catholics, at a count of about 65 million, represent the largest single church body.  Some might say that this count is optimistic, in that half these Catholics do not routinely go to church. If this is so, then the largest church body is the 32.5 million Catholics, such as myself, who go to church on each Sunday, and on the six Holy Days for the United States. Then, the second largest single church body in the United States would be the 32.5 million unchurched Catholics, who were baptized Catholic, (and therefore are baptized Christians), but who do not attend church, or go only at Easter or Christmas.  Neither of these groups would use the King James, so why should Cahill quote from that English version of the Bible?  There are better translations.<br />Since the author took so long to establish what I think much of his intended audience already accepted, I could not rate this work highly.  I did appreciate the excellent reading abilities of Richard Davidson, whose voice helped me through the traffic jams on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston.each Sunday, and on the six Holy Days for the United States.

Not with this book! The pictures are the chief attraction of &quot;A Gap In Nature&quot;. Organized by the Australian writer, Tim Flannery, this book collects in one place a tribute to the many species that have become extinct in the recent past, since the first voyage of Columbus.<br />The artist, Peter Schouten, spent years drawing life-sized portraits for each of the 103 animals, for the beautiful illustrations of this book. Schouten's brilliant, full color illustrations are a delight to look at, and will keep the attention of even a three-year-old boy.  My grandson asked, &quot;What's that?&quot; as we turned the pages and then,  &quot;Is that a mouse?&quot; when looking at the &quot;Pig-footed Bandicoot&quot; on pages 96-97.  No, I found out that the Bandicoot was not a mouse, but rather an Australian marsupial, about &quot;...the size of a kitten&quot;.  I had never seen such an animal before, and that is the poignant message of this book.  The beautiful pictures show animals that no longer exist.<br />The author, Tim Flannery, has previously expounded his thesis that the arrival of humankind heralded the extinction of so many different animals on so many different continents and islands.  For example, in his recent book, &quot;The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples&quot;, Flannery ascribes the destruction of the mammoths, mastodons and giant sloths to the arrival of the first humans in North America some 13,200 years ago, in what he terms &quot;a megafauna barbecue&quot;.  In &quot;A Gap In Nature&quot;, Dr. Flannery does not have to dwell too deeply on the culpability of humans in this worldwide extinction. It is enough to sit there and sadly turn page after page, picture after picture, of so many beautiful animals, which no longer exist.ere and sadly turn page after page, picture after picture, of so many beautiful animals, which no longer exist.	2002-03-01

Triplet, Edited by Robert H. Ferrell, sub-titled, &quot;A Memoir, 1941-1945&quot;.  University of Missouri Press, 2001.<br />Robert H. Ferrill, Professor Emeritus, Indiana University, has again taken the writings of William S. Triplet, of Sedalia, Missouri, edited the writings and produced an excellent first person history of an Army colonel's experiences in the Second World War.  William Triplet had served as a sergeant in the First World War, began West Point in 1920 and graduated with the class of 1924.  This book is really a professional diary of the years from December 1940 up to the cessation of hostiles in Europe, May 1945.<br />The front half of the book is devoted to Triplet's experiences in weapons testing and in developing amphibious craft for the many beach invasions by General MacArthur. At the command for testing the effectiveness of various weapons and devices, Triplet recorded his efforts in examining the effects of the Molotov Cocktail, (ineffective against armor), the prototype for the Jeep and various forms of sleeping bags. With the amphibious craft, Triplet discovers that many (most) Navy personnel do not understand the effects of ocean waves and tells us, quite a few times, that the Navy makes strong coffee.  &quot;I sipped the black brew and got it down without wincing.  ... tough people these navy types&quot;. P. 64.  Again, no love is lost between Col. Triplet and &quot;Admiral Buships&quot;, who questioned the veracity of Triplet's reports on the seaworthiness of the M8 howitzer-turret on the LVT(A-1) hulls.  P. 84. The Admiral even &quot;Declined my offer of a cup of coffee, which is the lifeblood of the navy&quot;. P. 84.<br />Perhaps of greater interest to World War II buffs is the last half of the book, recording the Colonel's combat experiences.  Triplet appears to be one of the few higher-grade officers to actual go up to the front line during combat.  For example, he recounts his surprising an Army sentry who calls back that there is a chicken colonel up here.  Unexpected! Triplet mildly disguises his impatience with privates, or generals!, who are reluctant to advance or who appear to be bordering on incompetence.  In many cases, he does not record the names of the offending parties.  He received one excuse so often that it is used for the title of a chapter: &quot;They've Got a lot of Stuff in There&quot;.  At the very end of the book, Triplet recounts, in a matter of fact fashion, the gunfight he had with two German soldiers.  After being blown out of his jeep, Triplet draws his .45 Automatic Pistol and shots at two Germans who thought they had finished everybody.  Triplet is wounded in the thigh, but escapes and limps back to his command.<br />Professor Ferrell's editing is so unobtrusive that you are only aware, once in awhile, that you are reading the corrected and revised words almost fifty years or so after Triplet had been written down.  For example, Prof. Ferrell will italicize the word &quot;illegible&quot; to denote that he could not decipher what Col. Triplet wanted. An excellent job of editing.unts his surprising an Army sentry who calls back that there is a chicken colonel up here.  Unexpected!

Leaphorn mystery, well done and very easy to read.  I was steered to this book by checking library listings on the Black Plague and other airborne illness, after I had read \\"The Doomsday Book\\" by Connie Willis. The so-called hanta virus had affected, in particular, the Navaho Nation in the American Southwest. The disease, spread by the droppings of small mice and other rodents,  provided an opportunity for a cottage industry to grow up in the Southwest where many aspiring Ph.D. students were attempting to make a name for themselves.<br />In the midst of all this, Acting Lt. Jim Chee charges a Hopi Indian, caught while poaching eagles, with the murder of a Navaho Tribal Policeman. The Hopi was arrested red handed, literally!, and Jim Chee believes that he has an open and shut case. But, Chee's once and future fianc&eacute;e, Janet Pete, returns from Washington, DC, as public defender, and, you guessed it, she is assigned to defend the Hopi<br />The plot is twisted and involved enough, when retired Lt. Leaphorn is hired as a \\"private investigator\\" to look into the disappearance of Cathy Pollard, a researcher, who vanished on the same day the Navajo policeman was killed.  Both Chee and Leaphorn are then immersed in the academic scene as they seek to sought out the involved relationships of prairie dog colonies, fleas, the Black Plague, the disappearance of Ms. Pollard, and the deaths of some Indians from the plague.  Hillerman continues to develop the characters of Leaphorn and Chee. For example, there is a poignant scene in the hospital, where Leaphorn's memories of watching his wife, Emma, being wheeled away on a gurney, never to be seen alive again, are described.  Leaphorn's life as a widower, also shows up now and then, as in the shower scene in the motel and, later, when he is enjoying eating another person's cooking in the restaurant.<br />I have come to identify George Guidall's voice with Lt. Leaphorn, and, if I ever meet Tony Hillerman in person, I would expect him to sound like Mr. Guidall.  Guidall does an excellent job of developing distinct vocal identities for each character, and his portrayal of FBI agents who have been hoodwinked by the \\"not-so-stupid\\" Tribal Policeman Lt Chee, is very appropriate.  I enjoyed Guidall's reading of \\"The First Eagle\\" as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston.  Hillerman has another winner.ant.<br />I have come to identify George Guidall's voice with Lt.

Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Wonderful Book to Keep The Children Busy At Christmastime	\\"Christmastime Is Cookie Time\\", by William Boniface, Illustrated by Ronnie Rooney.,<br />Price, Stern,  Sloan, 2001.<br />This is a wonderful little book to keep the attention of the young ones while they are waiting for Santa and you are making Christmas cookies.  William Boniface has again written lively verse, describing the annual family holiday task of making batches of sugar cookies to enjoy  while celebrating Christmas.  Ronnie Rooney has provided beautiful and bright \\"cookies\\", which the children can place into the correct slots of the board by each page.<br />I bought this book for my grandchildren and watched as my daughter, their mother, made the sugar cookies.  Some cookies were a little too well done, and they were used for my tea, but the others, when cooled, were frosted by many willing hands.  The book's cookies were miniatures of the baked cookies.  The book illustrator has based the cardboard cookies on the design of cookie cutters that have been in use for more than 30 years, perhaps 50 years.  Therefore, the children use the book's  cardboard cookies the same as, or at least very similar, to the cookies being baked in the oven.  The Christmas colors used by the illustrator are bright enough to match the verse by William Boniface,<br /> \\"Since no two snowflakes are the same,<br />  We've made ours all unique,\\"<br /> \\"And sprinkled them with powdered sugar.<br />  Come and take a peek\\".<br />Take a peek at that page and see the powdered sugar suspended in mid-air by the artist: it is truly being sprinkled on the cookies! From personal experience, this Grandfather would recommend this book with five stars.	2002-02-17

Connie Willis is an established author who has turned her talents to common sense approach to time travel. Since I have recently received my MA in History, I am intrigued by her proposition that future historians will be \\"hands-on\\" workers, actually travelling to the era they are interested in, which requires them to develop an in-depth understanding of that time.  This means that the time-travelling historian must know the language, understand the era's technology and be able to fit right in.  Tall order! For example, I could not even order a soda in the 1957-1958 US South, when I was stationed there in the US Navy. My New York English was not understood in Memphis.<br />Besides her common sense approach, Connie Willis has done some fine writing, as for example, she describes the starry night sky on Christmas Eve in 1348.  I am certain that she has read Edgar Allan Poe's, \\"The Bells\\", since she uses the word, \\"crystalline\\" to echo his use in that poem. Personally, I have not seen the word \\"crystalline\\" used outside of Poe and electronic engineering texts on transistors.<br />The author's irritating British bureaucrats, (e.g. Gilchrist), of the 21st Century are reflected in the rigid class system of 1348, and I wonder if Willis did this on purpose. She does develop interesting characters, more in 1348 than in the future, and it is sad to see the pouting, almost spoiled young girl, Agnes, come down with the Black Plague.<br />The author could do a wee bit more research on the Catholic Church (which, by the way, is alive and well in 2002), as she has Kivrin saying that she \\"..said the Mass for the Dead\\" for Fr. Roche.  Only an ordained priest can \\"say\\" a Mass, in 1348, or 2002, or 2054, so Kivrin might have prayed for Roche, but not by saying a Mass. Her comic relief characters, (we are running short of lavatory paper!) could be minimized, but the boy, Collin, moves things along. Her almost causal announcement of the deaths, due to flu, of Dr. (Great Aunt) Mary and the protagonist bureaucrat, Gilchrist, seemed too easy a way to eliminate them.<br />The Audio Tape version was easier than reading the actual book, since Jenney Sterlin does such a good job of pronouncing the Old English texts, so you almost could understand the words.  Especially if you had studied German.  Sterlin's reading of this book helped me through many an hour on Interstate 495, the ring road around Boston.

Were Americans truly so set on reaping the dollars (marks) that they ignored the implications of a Communistic Russia?  Set in the hot weather of the Potsdam Conference, July/August 1945, author J. Kanon uses his skills to develop a word picture of a bombed-out, destroyed Berlin.  Kanon portrays the scenes as \\"you are there!\\" descriptions of the ruined capital city of the Third Reich, as the gun fights and car chases carry the chief character, Jake Geismar, in and out of harm's way.<br />Jake Geismar is a realistic portrayal of the jaded correspondent, who came to Berlin during Hitler's Olympic Games. Geismar had stayed on to report the historical events, fell in love with Lena Brandt, and all this serves as the foundation for his return to a conquered Germany and the events of 1945.<br />An over-riding theme is Geismar's continued attempt to understand how an educated and cultured Germany could have tolerated, no, more than tolerated, ...how the Germans could have joined in the crimes of the Nazis.  This guilt-seeking theme slows the book, but is necessary for the final resolution when the murderer of Lt. Tully, the American Army officer, is identified.<br />There are some logistical questions, such as how a person (Geismar) can operate an old-fashioned manual typewriter, when his arm is in a cast, and how the little German boy, Erik, (three years old) is able to understand not only his native German, but also English ... so much so that the boy is taken out of the hospital room to avoid hearing details.<br />The reader of the audio version, Mr. Stanley Tucci, does a fine job with what we usually consider German accents, and he has fine characterization of both female and male personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors.  I enjoyed this audio book as I drove Interstate 495 around Boston, in my daily commute.cterization of both female and male personages, so you think you are really hearing dialogue between actors.

The book traces the ecological history of the Continent down to the present, with an emphasis on the disappering or changing frontier.<br />The author, an Australian professor, despite his Irish surname, describes the changes in the fauna (and somewhat the flora) of North America over the past 65 millions year, from the crashdown of the comet that destroyed the dinosaurs to the arrival of mankind and down to the present age, with the influx of immigrants, mainly from Europe.  Professor Flannery takes for granted the theory of the movement of continental landmasses over the eons, the destruction of an entire order of creation by the smashing effects of a comet (asteroid?) and the arrival of the first humans about 13,200 years.  Interestingly, Flannery is not afraid to be politically incorrect, as he ascribes the destruction of the mammoths, mastodons and other large animals (including the giant sloths and horses) to the arrival and expert skill of the first humans, the ancestors of today's Native Americans.  These \\"Clovis Points\\" hunters were so expert that in a short three centuries they rid both North and South America of these largest animals in what Flannery describes as \\"a megafauna barbecue\\". He has a way with words, and every now and then puts in some Australian usage, e.g. \\"wonky\\".<br />In his description of evolution of the animals on North America, Dr. Flannery makes it clear that dogs  \\"(family Canidae) are a true production of North America\\".  After describing the dogs and their North American evolution, he addresses the cheetah, belonging to the only genus of living cats that may have originated in North America.  On p. 115, he writes a memorable statement, \\"What is a cheetah but a cat trying to be a dog?\\"  The Professor's insight is different than most of my college and university teachers!<br />As the book gets close and closer to the present time, the chapters become shorter and shorter.  He spends some time describing the political and stylish differences between the New England colonies and Virginia, with an emphasis on how a New World weed, tobacco, would shape Virginia's history, leading to plantations and \\"egalitarianism\\".  He terms the American War of Independence \\"...a bitter struggle, a true civil war\\", which, with his Irish surname, I would not expect.  The Irish immigrants in the American Continental Army, and the German settlers in Pennsylvania and Upstate New York definitely did not consider the Revolution to be civil war between Englishmen.<br />The book is well written, and well documented, with pages 358 to 385 devoted to Notes and books referenced.

Audio Cassette version read by Josephine Bailey, Books on Tape/Penguin Putnam, Inc. Book Number 5708<br />Set in England, in1665-1666, this book recounts in vivid detail the effects of the plague on a little village whose main industry is lead mining.  On one level, it is entirely too detailed account of how so many people sickened and died from the plague, spread by rodents and their fleas.  On another level, it is a love story of the village minister and his wife, Eleanor. On a third level, it is a story of the achievements of the young housemaid, Anna, who becomes the central character recoding the events of the \\"Year of Wonders\\".<br />The minister's wife, Eleanor, recognizes the intellectual ability of the recently widowed Anna, and begins to teach her reading and writing. Anna's husband had died in a lead mine cave-in.  The young minister, who takes the place of the older Puritan cleric, preaches a sermon which causes the village population to quarantine themselves after they discover they are infected with plague. During this year of quarantine, Anna, the housewife, grows from a simple village girl, (who suffered the loss of husband and then her two sons), into an established mid-wife, with a knowledge of medicinal herbs, the ability to ease both child birth and the birthing of lambs, and a the ability to understand the motives of so many of her neighbors.<br />In some ways, this book is too gory: the details of the birthing of both lambs and children are far too vivid.  The details of the death of Anna's father, as punishment for cheating his neighbors when he dug the graves for the dead, are too vivid.  And, the attempt to drown the newborn daughter of Lady Bradford is described too vividly. Some of this I ascribe to the ability of the reader, Josephine Bailey, whose skill in making you see and feel the scene is a wonder in itself.  Ms. Bailey, the reader for the audio book, has a wide vocal range, so that you can almost hear the preacher exhorting the villagers to establish their self-imposed quarantine.

Thorndike Press, Thorndike, Maine, Large type edition, 1997.<br />An excellent book, dealing with the loss of the K-219, a Soviet Nuclear submarine, off the east coast of the United States. This book is non-fiction but it reads like a fast moving, modern day thrill novel, thanks, probably, to the efforts of author R. Alan White.  The book also reads like a \\"you are there!\\" recitation of the events of the sinking, undoubtedly due to the efforts of Igor Kurdin, of the Russian Navy.  Finally, there are some pointed comments about higher-level actions and reactions, probably due to the efforts of Captain Peter Huchthausen, USN, Retired.  It is impressive that three different writers from such disparate backgrounds could produce a book that is such a well-written story of the events in the sinking of the K-219. It all comes together in such an interesting fashion that it was difficult to put the book down.<br />As we watch the world react to the aftermath of September 11 2001, we wonder why the CIA and the FBI did not have better communications with each other agency.  The provincialism and secrecy of the USN submarine service is well documented in this book. In some ways, this is a theme of this book; rivalry between service branches and within each service hinders cooperation and communications.  On page 225, for example, you can find: the U.S. Navy's \\"... number one enemy: the United Sates Air Force\\".  Personally, I can recall working as reliability engineer on a small Navy project in 1987, and I referenced an Air Force document as substantiation for my calculations.  I was told, \\"Wrong color blue\\".  Navy Blue versus Air Force blue.	2001-12-19

Lottman, sub-titled, \\"A Dramatic Narrative of the Final Weeks in Paris Before Its Capture by the German Army\\".  HarperCollins, 1992.<br />This is a lengthy, (410 pages), well written book, describing the last five weeks or so of Paris as a free city before occupation by the German Army.  The author, Herbert Lottman, a Native New Yorker, has written on other French subjects, including Marshall Petain, Albert Camus and Flaubert so Lottman is well prepared for this book. Each day from May 9, 1940 to June 23, 1940 is covered in a single chapter.  The author did exhaustive research for each chapter.  The book is exceedingly complete.  After some reading,  the reader can be so overwhelmed by the wealth of  information that Lottman provides, that the temptation is to sneak ahead to the June 14th Chapter.  June 14, 1940, is the day that German troops actually entered Paris.<br /> Lottman brings to life the main actors in the French government, including Premier Paul Reynaud,  his ever-interfering mistress, the old general Philippe Petain, and newly promoted general, Charles De Gaulle.  By referencing their writings, the author also tells the tales of famous people, such as Jena-Paul Sarte, the philosopher, Maurice Chevalier, the actor, and many different journalists, including William Shirer and Clare Booth Luce.  He does not, however, limit the personal reminiscences to the rich and famous, but includes recollections of the common people, including the French sergeant ordered to blow up the Eiffel Tower.  Interestingly, one of the more memorable individuals in the book is the American Ambassador to France, William C. Bullitt, a friend of President Franklin Roosevelt.  I wonder if H. Lottman chose some of the statements and actions of Ambassador Bullitt to provide a form of comic relief for the serious subject in this serious book.<br /> Even in such a scholarly work, errors creep in.  On page 341, he writes, \\"There were policemen here and their along their way.\\"  Clearly, too many possesive \\"theirs\\" are present.  He wanted, \\"There were policemen here and there along their way\\".  On page 394, in describing the visit of Adolf Hitler to a conquered Paris, Lottman terms Hitler, \\"Reichsfuehrer\\".  Hitler was just simply \\"Der Fuehrer\\" and it was Heinrich Himmler (1900-1945) who had the title of \\"Reichsfuehrer\\".  Overall, though, the book is well written and complete to the point of exhaustion.licemen here and their along their way.\\"  Clearly, too many possesive \\"theirs\\" are present.

Audio Cassette version read by Juliet Stevenson, Bantam Doubleday Dell Audio Publishing.<br />This is an excellent book, set in two different eras: England in the near term future and Europe during the 1300s and the Black Plague.  The author switches back and forth from a future where antibiotics do not work to a past where antibiotics are unknown.  There are two different stories being told, centering on the threat of the Black Plague, and which are neatly wrapped up and tied together in the last chapter of the book.  In my opinion, the characters in the future world, located physically in London and the north of the UK, are not developed as fully as are the characters in the past world.  The 14th Century physician, Doctor Alejandro Canches, is nicely portrayed, but unnecessarily complicated (again, in my opinion), by making him a Jew in a Christian world. It was difficult enough to be a physician dissecting cadavers at a time when the dead body was considered sacred, without adding the distrust of being a Jew (an outsider) in a Christian society.  However, Ann Benson builds a likeable character in Dr. Canches, a Spaniard, who travels first to France and then to England.  Then, it is not really clear how he is able to communicate so effectively in France and in England.<br />The author's future world, not as fully developed as her past story world, contains some macabre happenings.  For example, the main protagonist, a surgeon, Janie Crowe, surgically removes the hand of a dead man so as to be able to open an electronic keypad, programmed to recognize and identify people by their handprint.  Besides being difficult to imagine without taking sick, you wonder if this description of mutilation is truly necessary for the advancement of the plot.<br />The audiotape reading of the book by Juliet Stevenson is a stellar performance. Using a woman's voice, J. Stevenson convincingly represents the royal tones of England's King Edward III, and then quickly becomes the sweet voice of Edward's illegitimate daughter, Kate.

But, I borrowed the audio tapes for the long drive on I495, especially for the slow down at the Mass Pike. Reading the book by Thomas Cahill left me somewhat dissatisfied, as Dr. Cahill's central thesis appeared disjointed and, he went on so long in making his point: that the Irish had indeed saved the writings of St. Augustine, Plato, etc., CIVILIZATION!,  and copied them over and re-distributed all these works throughout Europe just at the right moment!<br /> I was surprised, however, and this is the main purpose of this review, that listening to the book really makes Dr. Cahill's point far better than reading the book!  Donal Donnelly, with just the right touch of an Irish accent, reads each chapter and builds on Plato and St. Augustine, and so on, until Cahill's main concept dawns on you and you say, as you listen to the last cassette, \\"Right, I see that without the Irish monks and their copying, we would have had to start over again at ground zero\\". Perhaps the noted author and sociologist, Fr. Andrew Greeley is correct when he describes the Irish as an \\"oral people\\", who still depend more on the spoken rather than the written word.<br />There are some drawbacks, as Mr. Donnelly struggles with the pronunciation of the French towns and monasteries begun by the Irish, and he really mutilates the Austrian name, \\"Salzburg\\".  I found the chapter on St. Patrick and his conversion of Ireland to be more moving if I read it to myself, rather than listening to the audio tape reading by Donnelly.  I recommend that you listen to the audio tapes after you've read the book.  And, finally, it is well worth the repetition: Europe consists of more cultural backgrounds than just the Latin/Germanic mainstreams.  This book deals with the neglected Celtic/Irish stream, and deserves your attention.ion.	2001-10-16

Brother Ty cannot help his clients (or himself) to make any money on the market, so, he enters a monastery, where the claim to fame is making wine. Brother Ty wanted to conquer his drinking habit!  When the Cana Monastery falls on hard financial times, Brother Ty turns to God and the monk's  breviary to determine money-winning tips on the market. This is the first sub-plot in this complicated but funny book.<br />The second sub-plot is based upon the first Miracle of our Lord at the Wedding Feast of Cana, where He changed water into wine at the request of His Mother, Mary.  Since the monastery is called Cana, you can bet that someone (?Brother Abbot?) will be attempting his own version of the wine-making miracle: this time to keep Federal Agents happy.  Then, there's the investigating Italian Monsignor, representing the Vatican and Cardinal \\"Blutspieler\\"; this urbane Italian, interested in soccer  (at least when Milan is playing), is also a wine connoisseur.  He really does not like his German boss, the Cardinal \\"Blood-player\\", and therefore the Italian settles in for a long stay at the Cana Monastery, which by now has hired a good-looking lady to deal with the necessary television advertising.  Of course, the wine is not being made at the Cana Monastery, but being imported from Chile, which means that Brother Ty has to continuously check with his \\"broker\\" to get tips to pay for the imported wine, and the improvements at the monastery, and so on.<br />The two, three, perhaps four sub-plots are tied together by the intermittent announcement of a pertinent law of \\"spiritual and financial\\" growth.  One of the authors, or both, must have had training in the Catholic school system, since their comic references to Church affairs and internal politics, given with great reverence, are fairly accurate.

World War II)	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Very Personal Reminiscence.	\\"Roll Me Over\\" by Raymond Gantter; sub-titled: \\"An Infantryman's World War II.\\"<br />Ivy Books, New York, 1997.<br />This is a very personal reminiscence of an infantryman's progress across Europe, from Normandy to Prague, during the last year of battle in World War II.  Private Gantter was college educated when most of his compatriots were not.  He preferred classical music to the more popular \\"jazz\\" of his buddies. R. Gantter was married while most of his fellow GIs were not.  He was sensitive and, like his companions, afflicted by homesickness  ...which also included being with his wife and children.  His daily observations of war and its effects were recorded sporadically (on scraps of paper) and later served as the basis for this book.  All of this results in a sensitive, personal and compassionate analysis of the advance of the American Army across Europe.<br />Gantter's ability, however limited, to speak German put him in demand, and gave him additional insight into the impact of the war on civilian population, even though they were the enemy.  Some incidents in his career as translator reinforced his negative opinion of the officers of the US Army.  For example, he was rushed down to act as translator to find that the American officer was dealing with petty concerns: the warmth in the commandeered house, the placement of furniture and so on. Throughout the book, Gantter has very little good to say about the officers of the American Army, thereby echoing other books describing personal disappointments of the officer cast of the same era. There were few \\"Chesty Pullers\\".<br />Gantter does present poignant imagery, as in his description of the shooting and killing of a German soldier, whose overcoat flaps were flouncing up and down as he ran way in the snow.  As a side issue, his personal recollection of the house holds shrines he found in Germany (even though he called some \\"Bleeding Heart\\" when he meant \\"Sacred Heart\\") is an independent confirmation of the inability of the Nazi Party to stamp out the faith and devotion of German Catholics.

Under The Bombs by Earl R. Beck, Sub-titled: The German Home Front 1942-1945, University Press of Kentucky, 1986.<br />History Professor Earl R. Beck understands the need for an evenhanded presentation of facts and conditions, and his book, Under The Bombs, is very balanced presentation of the conditions that existed in the Nazi Reich in the years from 1942 to 1945. Beck neither defends nor attacks the bombing of German cities and German civilians. The Professor does not sensationalize the bombing raids on German cities, but, in a rather quiet and an almost dispassionate fashion, describes the impact of so many tons of bombs dropped on so many civilians. In so writing, Dr. Beck actually presents a cogent case against aerial bombing.<br />This book, however, is NOT a collection of statistics about the number of bombers, the tonnage of bombs, and the quantity of casualties and the horror of war on civilians. The book is really about the German people and how they suffered during the bombing raids. Enough details are given to cover the general history of the air war against Nazi Germany, but Professor Beck emphasizes aspects that others have not. For example, he gives more coverage to the firestorm in the German city of Hamburg (see his chapter, Bombing Achieves Holocaust), than the more famous (infamous) firestorm in the eastern German city of Dresden (later in the war). I wonder how many people were offended by the equating of the firestorm to a holocaust? Further, Dr. Beck quietly asserts troubling facts, Unable to attack Germany by land, with the fighting in Italy still far away from the German borders, and the British had only one way to bring the war home to Germany  from the air. P. 64. Dr. Beck states that the British were prisoners of the weapons they possessed. On page 65, Beck relates how Britains Air Marshall Harris initiated the modern concept of the body count, by keeping account of the effects of aerial bombardment in terms of the degree of destruction and the number of persons killed.<br />On the other hand, this book attempts to relate personal feelings, gleaned from countless records and interpretations of Party correspondence. For example, the Party could not tolerate church services being held for the dead in the bombed cities. Dr. Beck relates how the Nazis worked to develop a more acceptable party procedure for such funerals. The book contains many details on the life of the individuals in the Third Reich and their morale. Stalingrad was the turning point. Dr. Beck then documents how the Nazi Party attempted to control every word spoken, in fact, even the thoughts of the Germans, by swift punishment for defeatist actions, words or sayings. If you ever have wondered why there was not more German resistance to the Nazis, read this book. Becks description of the promulgation of a Nazi Christmas (p. 105) is particularly telling. This book is a worthwhile,well written assessment of the state of mind of the German civilians and the deterioration of that state as the War wore on.ial bombardment in terms of the degree of destruction and the number of persons killed. <br />On the other hand, this book attempts to relate personal feelings, gleaned from countless records and interpretations of Party correspondence.

Martin Russ has written this book almost exclusively from the point of view of the ground-pounding Marine, with the general officers rarely mentioned. When Mr. Russ does mention high-ranking individuals, such as General Douglas MacArthur, it is to point out, scornfully, their mistakes and lack of leadership. Interestingly, Russ does not emphasize the role of Marine General Chesty Puller in this campaign.<br />This review is called \\"Semper Fi\\" as Mr. Martin sees almost everything from the USMC perspective, with a major exception (perhaps) being the U.S. Navy Medical Corpsmen who accompanied the Marines. Was the U.S. Army that bad?, \\"Thus, one U.S. Army unit abandoned another U.S. Army unit\\" p. 262. A more balanced presentation is called for, as, for example, in the efforts of Naval Air , who supported the Marines on the ground as much as Marine Air.<br />Overall, despite the defendable bias for the Marines, the horror and the \\"you are there\\" recounting of the swarming of the Chinese soldiers into death by guns of the Marines makes this vivid description of the Chosin campaign well worth reading.	2001-09-07

Goble, Ph.D.<br />A well-written book that presents fundamentals of reliability, probability and safety in a literate fashion. Dr. Goble, a graduate of Villanova University in Pennsylvania, has put together a literate presentation of reliability, probability mathematics and the basics of safety. This single volume represents a concise and easy flowing approach to the calculation of the probability of occurrence of an event that can affect the safety of your process control plant. The book begins with basics (\\"Understanding Random Events\\") but soon has you performing Markov analyses and working on \\"coverage\\". In fact, Bill Goble's explanation of the \\"coverage factor\\", page 313, is one of the best I have seen. If an analyst follows the layout of this book, and performs all the steps, as indicated by Dr. Goble, then the final result will include a system model, identify the important or crucial failure modes, calculate the probability of the occurrence of those crucial failure modes and provide a Markov model of the entire crucial/critical part of the safety system. All of this will allow the analyst to perform the required mathematical description of the safety system, so as to meet or exceed the requirements of the IEC Standard IEC 61508. Dr. Goble uses this book as the text for an ISA course with almost the same title as the title of the book. Dr. Goble follows the book implicitly in the ISA course I attended in 1999, and I enjoyed his vitalized presentation greatly. He emphasized the need for Failure Modes And Effects Analyses so as to identify crucial/critical failure modes, and the need for the FMEA to develop the proper Markov model for the system/sub-system. The book is so well written that I do not expect the typical engineer to have many questions, but, if you want an entertaining presentation and an enjoyable classroom experience, take Dr. Goble's ISA course with this book. I highly recommend this book to not only engineers concerned with probability of safety events, but for the general reliability engineer.<br />John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.this book to not only engineers concerned with probability of safety events, but for the general reliability engineer.<BR>John Peter Rooney, ASQ Certified Reliability Engineer #2425.	2001-08-30

Cantor. The Free Press, 2001 The cover of this book aroused my interest. I began reading the book, but stopped when I found that Norman Cantor had spun his wheels in too many places. As with many American historians, Mr. Cantor spends too much time (in my humble opinion) on the effects of the plague on the British Isles. Wouldn't it be nice to hear what happened, in, for example, Warsaw? While dealing with the black plague in England, however, Mr. Cantor appears to be proposing an interesting thesis: (see pages 11 to 17), that the plague's killing power was enhanced by the presence of another disease, anthrax. Anthrax is common in sheep rising lands. For example, (P. 13), \\"...death that occurred within three or four days of incubation\\"; far too rapid for just the black plague. On page 15, Cantor reports that the \\"...excavation yielded three anthrax spores from a cesspool into which human waste was discharged\\". BUT!, and it is big, Mr. Cantor does not explain if this spore presence is good, bad or indifferent as far as advancing the theory of the synergy of anthrax and the plague. Why bring up all of this at this point in the book? Why expect the common reader ( I have degrees in engineering and History) to understand if \\"three anthrax spores \\" was a big deal? Or does this happen ordinarily? Daily in sheep country? I scanned the book, but stopped reading when Mr. Cantor named the \\"Peasants' Revolt of 1381 in eastern England\\" as the \\"...greatest proletarian rising before the eighteenth century\\". (P. 24). I wonder if Dr. Martin Luther would consider that English uprising greater than the Peasants' War he witnessed in Germany and Austria in 1524-1525? Or was that Germanic uprising of the common people not \\"proletarian\\" enough? This book could benefit from the efforts of a good editor, to bring the work together, with some few central thesis statements clearly presented in the early structure of the book.

In this book, John McKenzie traces the advance of the Allied Army from the Normandy Beaches to the capture of Berlin. McKenzie, a chemical engineer in later life (who says engineers can't write!?) describes his efforts as a forward observer with the famous 82nd Airborne.  His writing is mater-of-fact , as, on page 23, he states that  \\"(t)here I learned what triage meant\\".  Priority was given to the seriously wounded who had the best chance of recovery, while the lightly wounded were treated last.  His description of the dead is limited to quiet testimony about \\"even more bodies and carnage than we had seen thus far\\". Page 24.<br />McKenzie has nothing but praise for airborne troopers, who generally had an \\"...IQ about ten points higher than the army minimum\\" (P. 39) and were required to be in top-notch physical condition before being accepted as airborne.  In many ways, the author echoes writers who have described the obvious effectiveness of elite troops, such as the U.S. Marines. (See \\"Breakout\\" by Martin Russ). McKenzie clearly considers the 82nd Airborne to have \\"...superior efficiency\\" (p. 39) , performing consistently with excellence.<br />There are some interesting personal observations such as the size of the German tanks in Normandy , the effects of the \\"Buzz bombs\\" on London  and the effectiveness of the Sherman tank as compared to the German Panther and Tiger tanks (p. 115). McKenzie sums up the weakness of the Sherman with \\"Since they usually wound up dead in single tank combat, our tankers developed swarming and flanking tactics that gave them shots against the panzers' more vulnerable side and rear armor\\" (p. 116)  He makes a small comment that epitomizes the lack of understanding of the superiority of the German weapons, \\"We wondered if our ordnance people had paid any attention at all to the war in North Africa.\\" \\"...we figured the state of our arms and ordnance should have been far advanced from what it was in late 1944.\\" (P. 117).  Finally, the author describes the trip home after the war, by train through `Belgium and then by ship across the Atlantic.  Typically, this last part is omitted by many others telling their personal memoirs, so McKenzie's story is appreciated.  Overall, this book is well written personal history of an important Army unit in the European theatre.eople had paid any attention at all to the war in North Africa.\\" \\"...we figured the state of our arms and ordnance should have been far advanced from what it was in late 1944.\\" (P. 117).

Audio Tape Version.<br />Initially, I borrowed this tape for the long commute on 495, the ring road around Boston. I am not a golfer, but the back cover spoke about a miracle on Christmas Day so I decided to listen to the tape.  After a few minutes of driving and listening, I had to pick up the plastic package to see if I had read the names of the authors correctly. Don't do that while you are driving in 495 traffic near the Mass Pike. Yes, it was James Patterson, the Manhattan College graduate (1969) and the writer of novels about terrible situations with not one, but two serial killers.<br />The \\"Miracle On The 17th Green\\" is, however, not about a new form of serial killer, nor is it even a murder mystery.  Instead, \\"Miracle\\" is an upbeat novel dealing with an advertising executive who has gone sour on his job, his marriage and, perhaps, even on life itself.  On a Christmas morning, Travis McKinley is out on a nearby golf course and he discovers that, on that day, he is really hitting them like a pro.  One thing builds on another and pretty soon Mr. McKinley is at Pebble Beach competing with some big-name golf pros.  On the overall level, this is really a very good golf story. I wish some TV announcers could bring a wee bit of the drama to televised golf that Patterson brings to this story.  I suggest, that, if need be, prepare by looking up some golf terms (such as birdie, bogie, eagle, etc.) so that the story flows and you do not have to stop for research.<br />On another level, this is really a love story, where a man and woman, despite two disparate careers, stay together for almost three decades.  The novel also deals with the human condition, as, for example, after a long career, each of us will have to look back and see if what we had done was worth it all. There may be a some autobiographical background here as James Patterson recently retired from a career as an advertising executive.  The novel, however, is situated in Chicago, and Mr. Patterson is really from the New York City area.<br />Hal Linden, who you will remember as Barney Miller in the police precinct television comedy, read the tape.  It is interesting to see that a familiar voice makes listening even easier as you drive along.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a few hours of driving to do. The book is well written, a good golf story and well read to boot.e novel, however, is situated in Chicago, and Mr. Patterson is really from the New York City area.  <br />Hal Linden, who you will remember as Barney Miller in the police precinct television comedy, read the tape.

Thorough History of Protestant Bible in English in the United States. \\"In Discordance with the Scriptures\\" by Peter J. Thuesen, sub-titled \\"American Protestant Battles Over Translating The Bible\\". Oxford University Press, 1999.<br />This book presents a history of the revisions of the English translations of the Bible, Old and New Testaments.  The book has, however, another central theme: the dilemma that Protestants face when they proclaim, \\"Sola Scriptura\\", or \\"scripture alone\\", while denying the necessity of a church body to pass on the acceptability of each revision. As a papist, I rely on the Pope to say that one version or another can be printed: \\"imprimatur\\". \\"In Discordance with the Scriptures\\", points out that Protestants have no such authority.  This book records the arguments of Protestants in the United States over the authority that would accept (or reject) each new English translation.  The old King James Version, \\"...deeply internalized by many Americans, and tacitly assumed to be the very Word of God, began to lose its unchallenged cultural hegemony\\".  Page 42.  It has always been a wonder to me that Protestants, who effectively demand the separation of church and state, tolerate a Bible with a King's name on it: a bible authorized by an alien king (James was a Scot, you know).<br />The author, Dr. Peter J. Thuesen, spends a good portion of the first two chapters on the influence that the Tyndale Bible had on the foundation of the translations of the Hebrew and Greek versions into English. Tyndale's work predates the King James Version (as does the Catholic English Bible, the Douay-Rheims version).  Dr. Thuesen is ecumenical enough to mention the encyclical of Pope Pius XII, \\"Divino Afflante Spiritu\\" (Page 80), which encouraged Catholic scholarship in biblical matters in the late 1950s.<br />The book records the difficulties that different Protestant sects or denominations had with the translations that affected theological matters.  For example, Isaiah 7:14, was given as child born to at \\"virgin\\" as a child born to a \\"young woman\\".  Dr. Thuesen reaches to John Calvin and into the New Testament accounts of the Virgin Birth (Matthew 1:23) to defend the propriety of the literally correct translation of Isaiah as \\"young woman\\".  The author further records that it is lamentable that in today's age a \\"young woman\\" is not synonymous with a \\"virgin\\".<br />Interestingly enough, throughout the book, the author considers the King James Version to be somewhat lacking in accuracy, and that the new revisions, such as the Revised Standard Version, (RSV), are better translations, clarifying some poorer renditions.  He does not cover, however, the Christmas story from Luke, which I remember, as a young boy,  noting that that Catholic version was \\"Peace on earth to men of good will\\", while the English King James version stated, \\"Peace on earth, good will to men\\".  Big difference!  Today, we have, \\"..Peace on earth to those on whom His favor rests\\".  This brings up style.  I wish that Dr. Thuesen had addressed style variations more completely.  For example, again using Luke's account of Christmas, \\"A decree went forth from Caesar Augustus that the whole world was to be censored.\\" is probably not acceptable in this politically correct, democratic world where emperors and dictators have been replaced by the democracy of the people. I would have like to see what Dr. Thuesen could have done with the changes in bible translations as the political scene in the world has changed.<br />As a practicing Christian (Roman Catholic, but still a Christian), I wanted the book to cover more on the ecumenically acceptable translations of the Bible.  The book's last chapter, \\"Epilogue\\" ended too soon for me, and I would recommend that future editions expand to consider Protestant/Catholic efforts on translations.  Further, there is a need for a history or consideration of translations into other common languages. For example, a Seventh Day Adventist, who knocked on my door, became angry when I showed him that Luther's translation called \\"Exodus\\", \\"The First Book of Moses\\".  In all, this book, by Peter J. Thuesen, is well written by a literate man, who attempts to present all sides fairly.entist, who knocked on my door, became angry when I showed him that Luther's translation called \\"Exodus\\", \\"The First Book of Moses\\".

In March, Pope John Paul II, the old nemesis of the Hebblethwaites, appointed 37 new cardinals to the College of Cardinals.  The College is now the most diverse in the almost 2000 years history of the Church.  In adding these new members, John Paul has broken down the careful foundations for the analyses of the book, \\"The Next Pope\\" and made much of that analysis obsolete.  For example, the addition of 37 new members increased the number of cardinals eligible to vote for the next pope to 128, eight more than the maximum of 120.  When questioned about this higher number, John Paul II replied, laconically, \\"Yes, I know.\\"<br />The 37 new members change much of the background for chapter 7 in the book. The Pope appointed many cardinals from Spanish-speaking countries that were once evangelized by Old Spain.  This Spanish-speaking Bloc is larger than the Italian Bloc.  In the next conclave (after John Paul dies), if the Spanish-speaking Bloc and the Italian Bloc work together, we may see the election of a Spanish-speaker to pope.  Further, that pope may be the first from the New World.  If, however, these two blocs cannot agree, the conclave may be long and weary. This might present an opportunity for the 12 cardinals from the United States and the eight from Germany to propose their own candidate, and that might be Cardinal Ratzinger, who is even more conservative than John Paul II.  Or, they may settle on the new Cardinal Avery Dulles, a liberal theology teacher at Fordham University, NYC, who is too old to vote in the conclave. What a difference the new members make!<br />There are new cardinals from Asia, who might unite with other cardinals from Asia and Oceania to form an Asia/Oceania bloc to draw attention to that remote corner of the world.  And, there are now two (!) cardinals from Ireland, doubling the chances of electing the first Irish pope, next time. In Chapter 7, Hebblethwaite attempted to identify the \\"Not-Yet Cardinals\\", as he called them.  Of the eight possibles, he was right on four and the other four did not make it.  That is only 50%, and I believe a competent reporter at the New York Times or the Washington Post could do as well with background research available at those papers.  So much for the \\"insight ` of Hebblethwaite.<br />Although the book was made obsolete and redundant by the latest appointment of cardinals, the book IS, however, a concise history of recent conclaves. Further, in the paper back format, it is easy to carry on an airplane and just about the right size for a cross-continent flight. The book is well written: there was only one error I could discover, on page 80, where &quot;Poland was carved up between three powerful neighbors...&quot;; in English, things are carved up between two neighbors or &quot;among three neighbors&quot;.

Manuel, published by Steerforth Press, 2000.<br />If you are looking for the usual reminiscences where an old soldier describes his Sherman tank cracking a curbstone in Prague in 1945 and seeing the same crack in 1995, then this book is NOT for you. Manuel's present memoirs, on the end of World War II in Europe, are written in a literate style by a man literate, not only in English, but also in French, German and Yiddish. Frank E. Manuel begins his book with the Battle of the Bulge, but he really does not see much action.  The central theme of his book is not, however, about military action, but rather the feelings and motivation of the enemy soldiers he interrogated.  The POWs ranged in rank from private to general.  Mr. Manuel describes their attitudes and personal attributes when captured.  A particularly notable chapter is Chapter 8, entitled, \\"A Houseful of Generals\\", where , in a the town of Weilheim, many of the German generals and their staff decided to stop running from the advancing American armies.  This chapter is a literate rebuttal of the German offer to become allies with the Anglo-Americans to keep the Mongol-Bolsheviks out of Western Europe.  Of course, this offer was rejected, and Frank Manuel states, \\"We wanted the Germans to say that they were ashamed of themselves\\", p. 97.  His next-to-last chapter is on his encounter with Admiral Horthy, Regent of Hungary, when he and the Admiral are transported to General Patch's headquarters.  He describes the Admiral's ineffectual attempts to break with his German allies, as the War comes towards its end.  The quote Mr. Manuel uses is, \\"Was konnte ich denn machen?\\", in English, \\"What could I do?\\" These are the words he also uses to end this chapter.<br />Throughout this book, Frank Manuel is well aware of his own Jewishness and how others could identify him as being a Jew.  The author senses that old Admiral Horthy knew that he was Jewish, and Horthy gave a monologue on \\"...his protection of Hungarian Jews and his refusal to participate in their round-up by the Nazis\\". P. 120. The author also relates how Polish officers questioned him, in Yiddish, about being a Jew.  But, in all of this, Frank Manuel is not, as far as I can read, defensive about being Jewish.  In describing the fate of the Poles, he states that \\"...they would wander the earth like the Jews and the Irish\\". P. 71.  In this single line, the author shows a deeper understanding of the many diasporas (Irish, Jewish or Polish) than many who believe in a monopoly of persecution, suffered only by their own kind.  This book is well worth your time.is protection of Hungarian Jews and his refusal to participate in their round-up by the Nazis\\". P. 120.

Grant Ireson, Clyde F. Coombs, Jr. and Richard Y. Moss,  McGraw Hill, 1996.<br />This is the second edition of the Handbook, which first appeared in 1988.  There are individual contributing authors for each of the 27 chapters; the resultant is already out of date.  The current \\"Limbo\\" status of military documents, such as Military Standard 105 and Military Handbook 217F, makes this present edition of the Handbook out of date in 2000. Will Military Handbook 217F ever be revised to provide up-to-date models for the failure rates of modern electronic components?<br />This Handbook would benefit from better editing.  For example, as a Handbook, it is expected that the index in the back of the physical book would contain page references to pertinent reliability terms and techniques.  Today's technology emphasizes Environmental Stress Screening, ESS.  The term, ESS, has been around for at least 15 years (or so: I recall doing an IEEE paper on ESS in 1988). It is expected that ESS and related terms such as HALT (Highly Accelerated Life Testing) and HASS, would be readily found in the Handbook's index.  They are not.<br />Same thing holds true for Software Reliability, where the chapter's author uses the cute term, \\"SMERFS Model\\" (p. 22.15),  but this term will not be found in the index. (SMERFS = Statistical Modeling and estimation of reliability functions for software.)  By the way, from a technical point of view, this chapter's  half page on the various models  for software reliability is very skimpy.  For example, Dr. Michael Elbert has written an entire IEEE paper on the selection of the proper model for software reliability.  It would be expected that a Handbook would be more complete than just a small portion of a page.  In Chapter 22, on Software Reliability, the author references a paper on the Rayleigh curve by \\"Gaffney\\" (p. 22.13).  The reference at the back of Chapter 22 gives the reference's name as \\"John Gafney\\".  This is a discrepancy that should have been caught by the editors.  I suspect that the correct spelling is \\"Gaffney\\", but both can not be correct.<br />There are other editorial lapses:  on page 16.24, Bellcore failure rates are compared to MIL-HDBK-217, and it is state that  Bellcore \\"... provides generally better failure rates than does MIL-HDBK-217F, which is supposedly based on field experience in communications equipment.\\" The way this sentence is presented implies that MIL-HDBK-217F is based upon experience in communications equipment, when, as most reliability practitioners know, MIL-HDBK-217F failure rates are based on environments from Ground, Fixed, to Ground, Benign, to Naval Sheltered and Airborne, etc, and on equipment from radios to radars to sonars, air data computers and fire control units.  This inconsistency in the use of the language ought to have been caught by the editors.<br />On page 16.6, there is a nice comparison of FITs to failures per million hours to %failure per 1000 hours. The Editors should make the reader aware that a billion in American usage (1 with nine zeroes after it) is not the same as European usage.  Chapter 6, on FMEAs is totally into the Risk Priority Number method where \\"gray beards\\" sit around and use the \\"Delphi\\" approach to ascertain  the probability of an event, the severity of that failure and whether or not the failure can be detected.  This is a very subjective method, and, in my humble opinion, RPN is being superceded  by more objective, quantitative methods (see IEC 61508).<br />In summary, prudent purchasers should await the next edition of this Handbook, if that edition considers all the changes taking place in the availability of military standards and the new leadership role of international standards in the reliability arena.

Blunt, Jr. Westport, CT, Praeger, 1994.<br />If you are looking for a book that tells the story of the Battle of the Bulge, (Dec, 1944), without listing a lot of movements of this numbered division against that Panzer group,  and if you are looking for a more personal and human  history of the battle, then Private Blount's memoirs are for you.  The sub-title of this book is, \\"A Private Comes Of Age\\".  The author traces not only his march across Europe, from the logistical landing at Normandy (after the battle) up to the 84th Infantry Division's reaching the Elbe River, but also the lessons he learned about man's inhumanity to man. He grew up in the European campaign.<br />Unlike similar personal history books, the author presents an extra added attraction: records of the reactions of German soldiers and civilians. Young Blount had learned German in high school, so this personal memoir, written from notes he had made fifty years ago,  is filled with comments from German soldiers and civilians.  For example, there are some entertaining memories such as a short and chubby German woman who berated the advancing American troops, until Blount smacked her on the behind with the stock of his M-1. On the serious side, Private Blount  describes in vivid detail the wounds suffered by both American and German soldiers, and how it was possible to become insensitive to such suffering.  His description, however, of the concentration camp victims at \\"Nord Stalag III, Ohrdruf, is heart rending, on pages 173-174.<br />The author pulls no punches in describing the officers of the American army.  In fact, his account of some incidents, such as the lieutenant  being awarded a Bronze Star,  while not even mentioning the efforts of Pvt. Blount in destroying an enemy tank , makes you wonder if the country should shut down West Point.  Further, his narrative of his court martial for fraternization with the Germans (since he was able to speak German) makes you wonder about the commonsense of some of the officers of the time.<br />Over the last fifty or so years, Roscoe Blount has been \\"an award winning investigative journalist\\", (according to the back flap of the book cover), so the writing in this book is excellent.  I would recommend this book to any one seeking  a glimpse of how it was in the American army in Europe during the last crucial year of the war.ak German) makes you wonder about the commonsense of some of the officers of the time.   <br />Over the last fifty or so years, Roscoe Blount has been \\"an award winning investigative journalist\\", (according to the back flap of the book cover), so the writing in this book is excellent.

Although she is an excellent writer, Jan Morris has not satisfied her title.  When I picked up this book, I expected to see our 16th President through the eyes of an outsider, who would bring a different insight to Lincoln.  Instead,  Morris has done the classical: she views the past through the standards and mores of the present .  In a small book, however, she covers  many of the myths or stories about Abraham Lincoln, despite the many mistakes found by Amazon reviewers, above.<br />However, I particularly object to her inflicting upon American readers the continuous British preoccupation with class, as she writes about Lincoln, on p. 88, that he might have considered himself as, ...\\"the clever imaginative, impressionable young man out of a lower social stratum bewitched by an upper-class style, and perhaps discerning it properly as his own.\\"  Her preoccupation with class misses the mark of  frontier America.  This book is a compact collection of Lincoln anecdotes but it does not live up to its title.	2000-11-02

His main character is a genius Ph. D. candidate (Jack Collier) from New Jersey who ignores the jealousies on the university campus (Harvard of all places) until his advisor, Professor Dutton springs a rather large conspiracy on  Jack.  Jack Collier is expelled for plagiarism, while it is Dutton who had done the real plagiarism. In hopes of a Nobel Prize, Dutton steals Jack's work, which was intended as a cure for cancer. In stealing Jack's discovery, Prof. Dutton  inadvertently changes the cure into a killer.  Jack carries the killer/cure across the United States,  while being pursued by FBI agents, one of whom is a psycho and another a Ph.D. in Biology.  This is an interesting sub-plot all on its own.<br />The book is well written, but some discrepancies crept in:  I do not think that the Boston Police Department has legal authority in  Cambridge, where Harvard is located.  The references to the BPD should have been to Cambridge Police.  On p. 209, the editor permitted \\"stewardess\\" to be used, when  today's correct usage is \\"flight attendant\\".  On p. 191, the verb \\"affects\\" was used when the noun, \\"effects\\" was required.  All of this is minor compared to the fast-moving story combining many modern themes.	2000-10-13

McMATH This book is about more than  just Marketing, although the sub-title is, \\"Marketing Lessons I've Learned  from over 80,000 New-Product Innovations and Idiocies\\".<br />Robert McMath has  produced a commentary on the History of the industrial complex of the  United States and much of the Western world.  On page 45 he states, \\"I miss  the civility.  I miss the sense of loyalty people felt to colleagues and  their companies\\". He also laments \\"... that widespread downsizing is  resulting in brand managers who are repeating yesterday's mistakes because  they and their organizations are totally unaware of the history of their  products\\". (p.45).  This is true not only in marketing organizations but  also in engineering firms.  On page 69, the author notes that America is  really not a \\"melting pot\\" but the more appropriate metaphor should be a  \\"salad bowl\\".  You will find such sociological comments throughout the  book.<br />The book is arranged by alphabetical order of topics.  Generally, I  avoid such books since it is similar to reading a dictionary. The author,  however, has been successful in writing a connected story about marketing  that stretches from \\"a\\", \\"ABRACADABRA\\" to \\"z\\", \\"ZETIGEISTS\\".  The book is  about more than just marketing and is well worth your time.	2000-08-25

Neill: This is an exceedingly well-written  by a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge ( December 1944). Mr. Neill, a  retired newspaper editor, has put together three separate accounts of that  battle. (1) On the first level, it is a personal recounting of the  hardships and terror he experienced as a rifleman in a company of the 99th  Infantry Division on the northern shoulder of the \\"Bulge\\".  (2). On the  second level, it is a somewhat truncated story of the ASTP: the Army  Specialized Training Program, which Mr. Neill claims was \\"... the largest  single college training program the U.S. government ever implemented\\"... p.  23. (3) The third level is his view of the officers and the commanding  generals.  He points out the ridiculous remedy that General Dwight D.  Eisenhower offered for trench foot, a serious ailment when the troops are  continuously exposed to wet mud in the bottom of their trenches.  In fact,  my opinion of General (later President) Eisenhower was lowered quite a bit  by the comments of veteran George W. Neill.  Further, there is no love lost  between Author Neill and Army's officer corps.`<br />In his little asides near  the end of each chapter Author Neill has hit upon a method of keeping the  story moving: he summarizes \\"On Our Side\\" in a brief paragraph and then  presents the German view in \\"On The Other Side\\".  This is a nice way of  avoiding looking up the actual history of each day and names of the major  participants.  One interesting comment is the description of the sparkling  silver strips that \\"decorated\\" many of the fir trees near his foxhole.  He  describes these strips as \\"window\\" or \\"chaff\\", the strips of aluminum  dropped by Allied aircraft to reflect German radar signals back to their  receivers, and mask the approaching waves of Allied bombers.  I have  wondered what happened to these strips when they hit the ground.<br />This  book is well worth reading.	2000-08-21

Norton, 1995.  This is a well written and well edited book, telling the personal story of Eric Lomax, who was Prisoner of War held by the Japanese during World War II. The author's  personal accounting of torture, beating and maltreatment of POWs by the  Japanese is a cool condemnation in black type on white paper of the inhuman  treatment common in the Pacific.  Lomax's almost causal recounting of how  he was tortured makes that section even more difficult to read.<br />The  title, \\"The Railway Man\\", comes from the author's life long obsession with  the railroads and locomotives.  His observations of railroads and  locomotives makes some of the more vivid writing in his autobiography.  His  personal journey from hatred of the Japanese translator, who participated  in prisoners' torture, to forgiveness of that person, marks one of the  highlights of the book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who believes  the Japanese acted in a civilized manner in the war they started in the  Pacific.	2000-08-01

Sister Wendy's Book of Saints By Sister Wendy Beckett.<br />This is a beautiful little book (96 pages), all bright and shiny paper with brilliant colors that almost leap off the page. Sister Wendy, the nun who has made a trade mark out of her running in and out of art museums, has collected the images of saints to support both her love of art and her orthodox views on Catholicism. The book begins with St. Peter (Petrine privilege?) and works its way down to lesser-known saints.<br />With each portrait, Sister Wendy points out an interesting tidbit. For example, with the Evangelist, St. Mark, (page 17), Sister Wendy indicates that the artist has portrayed the saint forming a cross with his pen and his sharpening knife. She lightens the mood by describing the lion, in the painting, as resembling &quot;... an imbecilic sheep gazing in wonderment...&quot; at St. Mark. This lightening of the mood is intentional as Sister Wendy repeats it (page 24) when she describes the ox in St. Luke's portrait as &quot;...an almost goofy ox&quot;.<br />Despite this levity, Sister Wendy comes across as quite serious about both the art depicting the saints and the theology of the saints she has chosen. In summary, I would be very happy to have this book given to me.	2000-07-21

Robert Daley has developed convincing  characters, ranging from a Protestant minister down to a French farmer,  whose reactions to the occupying German forces appear to be such a credible  description that the novel reads more like a personal history. Into the  complex arena of occupied France, Mr. Daley pops in (literally) a shot-down  American flier.  (I wondered why Daley had the American pilot, David  Gannon, attending Fordham University, until I looked up the author's  biography and saw that R. Daley had graduated from Fordham in 1951.)  Davey, the downed and wounded American pilot, has to be cared for by the  stepdaughter of the minister, Andre Favert, and, as usual, one thing leads  to another, and the pilot and the daughter are doing what comes naturally.  Daley excels in describing naturally occurring events, as the drive in the  snow to the prison, the tracks the farmer left behind when he drew the  gasoline from crashed American plane, and the treatment of the farmer, his  farm and his animals when the Germans discover that the farmer had helped  the American airman.  For example, the author has the German soldiers not  just killing the pigs, but butchering them and taking away the hams.  This  presents the picture of a group of men destroying a farm, killing the  farmer and all the while considering what they were going to do for dinner  after the &quot;work&quot; was done.  Daley does not completely develop the  German characters, in my opinion, as the German soldiers are depicted more  as grasping and thieving individuals, rather than fanatics of an army of  Master-Race	2000-07-20

Scott Appleby. 1995. The editors have collected 12 different chapters representing the conservative Catholic point of view on  matters ranging from the &quot;Loss of Theological Unity&quot; to American  Catholics in the pro-life movement.  This book is definitively written  from the Catholic view. For example, you will not find a chapter on the  Fundamentals' controversy over creationism versus evolution, as that has  already been put to bed by the statements of at least three popes.  Our  separated Protestant brethren will also probably wonder at the theme of the  chapter on the loss of theological unity.  There is a &quot;resource&quot;  chapter on the &quot;Fellowship of Catholic Scholars&quot; which I found  more of a recruiting  nature, but then,  that is acceptable. There is the  obligatory politically correct chapter on the Hispanic observations on the  conservative-liberal controversies, in which the Jesuit author displays his  own cultural insensitivity by using &quot;Anglo&quot;, to lump together all  those who are  &quot;white&quot; as Anglos.  Just because my eyes are  blue, my skin fair and my hair blonde, (when I had hair) does not classify  me as an Anglo.  Many of us of Irish descent consider the term  &quot;Anglo&quot; to be insulting.  Of most interest to me was the chapter  by Professor Weaver (Indiana University) on the four  &quot;restoration&quot; Catholic colleges which are bucking the  secularization trend of the 230+ Catholic colleges.  I used her chapter in  my MA, History thesis. Overall, the book is worth the effort to purchase (  I bought my copy through Amazon.com) and to use as a benchmark to measure  trends in Catholicism in the U.S.	2000-07-07

This is a short book, (98 pages) intended for a younger audience, while providing a well-written and very complete history of this famous unit. Any person of Irish descent would be happy to own this book.  Susan Beller records the  glory garnered by the Irish Brigade in some of the most decisive and  heaviest battles in the Civil War.  Ms. Beller addresses the proven bravery  displayed by the actions of the Irish Brigade, (made up of the 69th New  York, 63rd NY, 88th NY and the 29th Massachusetts) at decisive battles, and  she gives vivid descriptions of the actions of the Brigade through some  important characters such as General Thomas Meagher (pronounced MAAAHer).  For example, at the bloodiest single day in American history, September  17th 1862, Susan Beller not only tells the story of the vital contribution  of the Irish Brigade at the &quot;Bloody Lane&quot;, but tells how, when  they ran out of ammunition, the Irish Brigade &quot;right-shouldered  arms&quot; and marched away in good order from the enemy. She also  describes how shaken General Meagher was when his horse was shot and  subsequently fell on the General. In this brief book, Ms. Beller provides a  complete synopsis of the life of the Irish rebel, Meagher, from  his early  days in Ireland to his exile in Australia and finally his escape and  settlement in America.  She also describes important historical events,  such as the famous &quot;general absolution&quot; given by Chaplain William  Corby.  Either one of these individuals would make a fine central character  in a movie about the &quot;Irish Brigade&quot;; .... The Irish Brigade, as Ms Beller relates, was involved in some of the  most important Civil War battles, and were so effective that it caused  Confederate General Robert E. Lee to state, &quot;Never were men so  brave&quot;, from which the author draws her title.  Perhaps Mel Gibson  might consider such a movie	2000-07-06
US	52766741	R2ACUTMF0JHAZC	1557508984	545207316	Dog Company Six	Books	5	32	32	N	N	Well written book	Dog Company Six: This is an excellent book, exceedingly well written.  Although presented as a novel, this work of fiction provides a thorough history of Marine Corps action in Korea, from the landings at Inchon up to  the end of the war.  The author, General Edwin Howard Simmons, records the  Marines' struggles, up and down the peninsula, north and south, through the  eyes of Captain Bayard, the commanding officer of Dog Company.  General  Simmons writes with an excellent command of the English language, which he  employs to describe the foul-ups and successes of the Marines in Korea.  This book is definitely written from the point of view of the  &quot;grunt&quot; in the mud (or snow).  The highest rank for a character  in the book is a light colonel.  I would highly recommend this book.	2000-06-21

Rakitin. A practical book by a practical author, presenting the steps required to set up a formal and complete Verification and Validation program for software  production.  Mr. Rakitin sprinkles pertinent quotations throughout the book  to support his case that software quality programs (detection) cost less  than simply releasing a &quot;buggy&quot; program to your Customers.  The  author also teaches the lessons of this book at IEEE lectures; I attended  one in March 1998.  At these lectures, the author fleshes out and makes  more interesting many of the points made in his book. As an ASQ Certified  Software Engineer, S. Rakitin has the credentials to expound on many  aspects of quality programs set up to deal effectively with the major &amp;  crucial issue of the lack of software quality today.  There are 169 pages  of text, describing a good program, but the author has also included some  87 pages of appendices (from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;H&quot;) which give you  a cook book or recipe approach to different aspects of software quality.  The author gives you good leads to other sources of information on software  quality. The book would profit from another good editorial review, reducing  the wordiness in some chapters and tying the whole story all together.  For  example, Rakitin continuously uses &quot;SEI&quot; which (as far as I can  see) is not defined in his book.  SEI = Software Engineering Institute.  In Chapter 4, the author attempts to establish a cost/benefit justification  for implementing a software quality program, but misses and then, later, on  page 90 (Chapter 7), he DOES lists the pertinent reasons as, &quot;...lower  support costs, ... fewer maintenance releases, ... higher customer satisfaction  and, as a result, increased sales&quot;.  An astute editor would have  melded all of this together. Overall, this book is directed at the  practitioner, whether a hardware quality engineer required to set up a  software quality program, or a novice who has the same task.  It is a  practical book, generally well written,d to set up a  software quality program, or a novice who has the same task.  It is a  practical book, generally well written,	2000-06-14

Book is subtitled, &quot;Catholic Higher Education in the Twentieth Century.&quot; At the outset, Professor Gleason notes that the  historiography of Catholic Higher Education is severely limited.  I bought  Prof. Gleason's book (from Amazon.com, by the way) since there were so very  few books dealing with the history of Catholic colleges and universities in  the United States. And I needed references for my MA thesis on Catholic  colleges. By writing a history of Catholic higher education, from 1900 to  1995, Dr. Gleason has expanded the field.  In covering this time period,  the author has chosen to emphasize the struggles of Catholic colleges and  universities to deal with modern ideas. These struggles were exacerbated by  the suspicion within the Catholic Church raised by &quot;Americanism&quot;  a name given to the modern forces which presented grave dangers to the  Faith and identified, rightly or wrongly, with the American church. Gleason  spends the first part of his book showing how that mis-identification  affected American Catholic schools up until about the end of World War II;  he then brings in various other historical events and figures, including  the work of Dorothy Day, Fr. Curran at The Catholic University of America  and, towards the end of the book, the charge of anti-intellectualism lodged  by Msgr. John Tracy Ellis.  Philip Gleason, however, does not raise the  counter-charge by Rev. Andrew M. Greeley, the noted fiction writer and  sociologist, who has found Catholic schools be just about as intellectual  or anti-intellectual as other colleges and universities in the United  States.  In the last few pages, Prof. Gleason missed a grand opportunity to  explore in greater detail the potential impact of &quot;Ex Corde  Ecclesiae&quot;, the August 1990 Constitutional Document of Pope John Paul  II, on modern Catholic higher education.  Some features of this document,  such as the requirement for an Oath of Fidelity, have been fought on the  grounds of academic freedom and autonomy for the Catholic colleges and  universities (particularly by some in the Association of Catholic Colleges  and Universities, ACCU).  The author has documented his citations with  about 92 pages of notes and references, making this volume a great step  forward in filling the gap in the historiography of Catholic Higher  Education.  There are many nuggets to be mined, as, for example, if your  interests is the &quot;Great Books&quot; approach to higher education, Dr.  Gleason's book leads you to references for the attempted &quot;Great  Books&quot; program at St. Mary's College in Moraga, California.  The book  is worth the price for wonderful tidbits such as that.e requirement for an Oath of Fidelity, have been fought on the  grounds of academic freedom and autonomy for the Catholic colleges and  universities (particularly by some in the Association of Catholic Colleges  and Universities, ACCU).

James Tunstead Burtchaell. This is an enormous book, some 868 pages long. Fr. Burtchaell deals with the secularization of the Christian colleges, which, as with Harvard and Yale, changed from a church-started, church-supported institution into secular, non-sectarian schools. His method is to pick one, two or three institutions in the particular denomination and deal with the history of the changes from a religious school into a secular institution. Fr. Burtchaell has a chapter for the Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Lutherans, Catholics and Evangelicals. The author's irony borders on humor once in awhile, as when he wonders why the Presbyterians found it so difficult to report the number of attending Presbyterians to church boards, but now find it so easy to report to the Federal government the racial make-up of the student body, down to the last Samoan. In the preface, Fr. Burtchaell notes that the reader will probably go directly to the section dealing with his/her religious affiliation. I did, but mainly because I was working on an MA thesis on Catholic colleges in the United States. I would recommend this encyclopaedia work to any one truly interested in the recent wave of secularization of church-related colleges in the US. Many details and stories from around the nation make this an interesting micro-history....	2000-06-07

In &quot;Serpent: The NUMA Files&quot;, Clive Cussler tests your credulity far too much. At the book's beginning, Cussler wants us to believe that a seaman, with a long scar from eye to lips, is the major  cause of the ramming of the Andrea Dora by the Stockholm.  This scar-faced  fellow shows up again, 30-40 years later.  He's there to protect the claim  of Columbus to be first in the New World! Further, the author wants you to  believe that the many disappearances of archaeologic teams over the last  few decades resulted from the actions of an old organization, &quot;The  Brotherhood&quot;.  The Brotherhood is an outgrowth of the Spanish  Inquisition, thus requiring you to believe in the discredited &quot;Black  Legend&quot; of Spain's colonial history.  All this conspiring makes you  wonder why The Brotherhood did not kill Harvard Professor Barry Fell before  he could publish his book, &quot;America B.C.: Ancient Visitors ...&quot;.  Professor Fell claims the the Libyans, Phoenicians and Celts were all here  in the centuries before Christ.  Oh well, The Brotherhood would also have  to dispose of all the school chridren who are taught that the Vikings  preceded Columbus by about 500 years.  Finally, towards the end of the  book, the author introduces the head of The Brotherhood who has a modern  revision of group's mission for the scar-faced sailor: they will not only  defend Columbus' claim to be first but they will also defend  accomplishments of the native population.  For example, the Mayans  developed a  wonderful calendar.  This was just too much for my credibility  quotient.  I popped out the tape and went back to listening to NPR.	2000-01-05
US	52766741	R311FUL5UFFF5D	0694521337	951535361	HMS Unseen	Books	3	9	11	N	N	Ending Weak	This is for the recording. The action in Patrick Robinson's &quot;H.M.S. Unseen&quot; moves at quite a pace.  Robinson introduces techncial issues rapidly and efficiently to show how a submarine could shoot down airliners  (including one with the Vice President of the United States). The  motivation of Commnader Benjamin Adnam is understandable, but the author  does not make a good case for Adnam's conversion into a distressed penitent  ...attempting to make admends for all his crimes against humanity. The  characterization of the American Admirals suffers in the recorded version.  I listened to David McCallum (of &quot;Man From Uncle&quot; fame) on my  daily drive.  McCallum failed to convert his educated British accent into a  reasonable facsimile of an American twang.  Further, the author puts too  many &quot;F---this&quot; and &quot;holy sh--&quot; and &quot;Jesus H.  Christ&quot; into the admiral's dialogue.  I found it offensive.  American  admirals have long since passed the stage of bumbling colonials, unable to  make a coherent statement under stressful situations  ---- especially  admirals who are supposed to be giving daily briefings to the U.S.  President.  (By the way,&quot;stewardess&quot; is out and &quot;flight  attendant&quot; is correct.) Finally, the ending is weak.  It is difficult,  based upon the characterization of Muslim Commander Adnam, to believe that  he would end it all that way.	1999-12-21

Ann Carey has expended a great deal of effort in writing a book that is a fair history of the \\"unraveling of women's religious communities\\" in the United States. Her attempts at fairness leads her to use \\"change oriented\\" in place of 'liberal\\" and \\"traditonal\\" in place of \\"conservative\\". (p. 9). Further, Ann Carey does not describe as a catastrophe (as I would!) the \\"88% drop in just 30 years\\" of the number of teaching sisters in Catholic Schools, nor does she attribute it to a change in vocation from \\"selflessnes: to selfishness\\", but she does quote, \\"Many sisters flet that their time would be better spent working with adults or children who were not enrolled in Catholic schools\\". (p. 33) The women's religious institutes \\"...lost their corporate identity\\" when they opted for \\"...occupational diversity\\". (p. 167) In another example of understatement, Ms Carey wonders if these institutes could be taxed on their profits. Selling of convents bought by the donations of the laity, competing with the laity in the work forces, not wearing habits despite the express wishes of the Pope and a collection of other incidents are recorded. Finally, Ms. Carey writes a prescription for dealing with Religious who are \\"procceding down the path of self-destruciton\\": \\"... the best way to deal with these sisters is simply to allow them and their institutes to die out quietly...\\" p. 324. I purchsed this book... for use in my MA Thesis in History, and Ms. Carey has filled a large hole in recent history, which is so often writen about the bishops, presidents and large scale events, rather than how these events affect the daily routine of the sisters and of the laity. In rejecting their vows, in not wearing their habits, in competing in the work force and in the political arena, the \\"new nuns\\" have become just like the rest of the lay people. The \\"new nuns\\" are off their pedestals and are no better, and perhaps worse, than the remainder of the laity. Ann Carey's book, \\"Sisters in Criisis\\", goes a long way towards explaining what happened and how it happened. I would recommend it to both the general reader and to the Historian.<br />John Peter Rooney, Plymouth, Massachusetts (For the record,I have had sixteen years of Catholic education, from grammar school through the only Catholic Engineering college in NYC.)goes a long way towards explaining what happened and how it happened.

As a person of Irish descent, I was very happy to see &quot;The Irish in America&quot;.  This book is full of colorful illustrations showing what the Irish have accomplished in this country.  I am referencing the book in my MA, History Thesis, this Autumn.<br />On page 57, however, the editors have made an understandable error.  They attribute the founding of Manhattan College (1853), De La Salle University (1863) and St. Mary's (Moraga, California, (1863) to the Irish Christian Brothers.  As a 1965 graduate of Manhattan College, I can tell you that these three colleges were founded by the French Christian Brothers, also know as the De La Salle Brothers.  This teaching order was founded in Paris by St. John Baptist de la Salle, and predates the Irish Christian Brothers by almost two hundred years.  To my knowledge, the only college founded by the Irish Christian Brothers in the U.S. is Iona College (1940) in New York. Personally, I enjoyed the book, found new facts about the Irish in America, and would recommend it  to any Irish or Irish-American person.	1998-06-11
