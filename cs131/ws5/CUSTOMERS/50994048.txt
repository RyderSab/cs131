BUT the good news is...a great story is just that...A GREAT STORY!!   <br /> <br />Yes there were similarities between the way the events of \\"Spell\\" and \\"Immortal\\" played out, but truth be told \\"Spell\\" is the better book by far.  Ms. Moning has redeemed herself as an author worthy of hardcover publishing as \\"Immortal\\" was a disappointing start... <br /> <br />Cian being an ancient MacKeltar Druid has all the scrumptuous alpha male qualities and magic that our other MacKeltar Druid heroes possess...which if you were a fan of Drustan and Daegus' stories you know the allure. Jessica was a decent character, but like Chloe, and to an extent, Gabby, was sort of \\"just there\\" in the story. Sadly, not since Gwen and Drustan has Ms. Moning been able to truly captivate the reader (well...me at least) with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and romance as well as depicting a heroine that was equally as compelling and integral as the hero. <br /> <br />But, I digress.  Spell of the Highlander was quite the intereting read filled with ancient lore and one of the best villains I've ever encountered in a romance novel.  Lucan was truly creepy and you just loved to hate him.  Conversely, you rooted for our hero all the way (of course) and enjoyed how the MacKeltar twins roles in \\"Spell\\" aided in the forward movement and ultimate resolution of the story. <br /> <br />Jessica and Cian's \\"love\\" was more steamy than mushy, reminiscent of Daegus and Chloe, and certainly not as wonderful as Drustan and Gwen's.  Cian has now moved to my #2 Moning hero as Drustan will always have my heart. <br /> <br />The reader is set up for more Highlander tales to come with mention of magical Druid Keltar heroes we have yet to meet...can't wait!  It would be nice if our beloved author could put some of the time travel back into her novels...now that was fun reading!	2005-09-10

Ewan's story was a delightful one.  The main and supporting characters were wonderful and the tale was fulfilling.  Our herione, this time the lovely Nora, was quite charming in her overly chatty ways.  How could Ewan (the great bear of a man in size and temperment) resist Nora's taming?   <br /> <br />The story opens with our hero having locked himself away from his family and the world as a self imposed punishment for the guilt he feels at his brother's death.  Enter Nora, the lass that needs Ewan's help to flee to England in order to escape an arranged marriage. Little does she know that her plan of escape almost exactly echoes the situation that caused Ewan's falling out with his family and ultimately the death of his beloved brother. <br /> <br />Ewan, for all his gruffness and ale imbibing to dull his emotional pain, is a man of honor and won't let Nora travel alone.  He agrees to take her instead to his brother's castle and be done with her scheming.  On the way, they fall in love.  It's that simple, but the tale is heartwarming and sweet. <br /> <br />Ms. MacGregor introduces us to a band of travelling gypsies as a supporting cast and they are as charming as our main characters.  There is certainly an opening for spin offs for Caterina as well as Pagan's stories.  Also, we as readers are set up for Lochlan to finally find a love of his own and secrets of the presumed dead Keiren are revealed... <br /> <br />Enjoy this book as it is a good one.	2005-08-26

After the stellar read of Born in Sin (MacAllister #2), Claiming was a disappointment.  It lacked all the finesse and magic Sin's story had. <br /> <br />This is a run of the mill story with characters that are not overly memorable.  Braden's character isn't well developed at all.  He comes across as shallow and ordinary (despite his extraordinary looks). Maggie, our heroine, has a bit more depth, her spirit and determination is clear, and it is refreshing to see a leading lady who is not perfectly exquisite, but rather just an average lass. <br /> <br />The majority of the tale is basically a 4 day walk in the woods without much action or drama.  The romance aspect is tame at best, and the \\"passionate\\" scenes are a bit unrealistic seeing as our heroine is an innocent yet conducts herself as a star in a XXX film...how did she learn all that anyway?  <br /> <br />It's a happy ending of course with all problems resolved.  Sin's role in this story is baffling.  Where is the hardened man that is depicted in Born in Sin?  There are a few mentions of his tortured past, but if I had started with this book, I wouldn't have been overly eager to read his story at all...and what a tale that was. <br /> <br />I will move on to Book #3, \\"Taming the Scottsman\\" in hopes that Ms. MacGregor's true talent is more evident in the last of the series.	2005-08-19

Often we a have a fondness for those characters, but to love them?  Very rare, indeed.  From the beginning of \\"Born in sin\\" our hero and heroine find their way into the hearts of the reader.  By page 130, I was already in love with Sin and wanted Callie to be my best friend.   <br /> <br />Is this a formula romance novel...most definitely, but it is the way Ms. MacGregor's tale unfolds, the wonderful writing and dialogue, as well as the descriptions of the surroundings and goings on that make this book a special read.  So often we see the hero as a hardened man shaped by his unfortunate past, but Sin's story takes the cake.   <br /> <br />The flashback scenes and the description of what his young life entailed pulls at the reader's compassionate heart strings in a way unlike any other.  Cursed, hated and ignored by his true parents, tossed out of his home and sold into slavery, trained and forced to be an assassin at a tender age to save his own life, being beaten and tortured throughout, had cruelly shaped Sin into the man he became.  Yet for all the vicious rumors and evil truths about our hero, he possesses a sense of honor and decency that shows he can indeed be saved.  You truly want our heroine to heal his emotional wounds, in fact, you demand that she does!  Callie is strong minded, high spirited, and determined with a blend of loveliness and patience that makes you adore her.   <br /> <br />This is a coming of age tale about a man holding onto his tortured youth, never daring to trust or hope for anything beyond what he could provide for himself.  Sin's repeated shock at the selfless kindness his lady love shows him is heart-warming and humbling to him and the reader alike.  The story is intriguing, but the romance takes center stage, as it should.    <br /> <br />I have reviewed Kinley MacGregor's books in the past and have stated that I liked her writing as Sherilyn Kenyon better, butafter this tale, my opinion has changed.  I truly hope you enjoy the magic of this story as much as I did.	2005-08-11

Serenity, who is anything but serene, is a marvelous heroine with her free and forward thinking ways that make our Pirate Prince hero's head spin at every turn.  We see here a hardened man who has suffered a tortured past (as they all seem to do), yet he is not so steely that he doesn't see Serenity for all the life and fiery passion she possesses.  They both yearn for love and a sense of belonging yet think they will never deserve it, much less find it.  This is the underlying sweetness of this tale.  Riproaring adventures on the high seas?  No.  A slow seduction where you really feel you get to know and like the characters?  Most definitely.  Room for spinoff novels of some of the supporting characters?...Absolutely.  Enjoy.	2005-08-10

It was most certainly a \\"real\\" Malory novel...all the usual suspects and antics are present.   <br /> <br />Amy is a great heroine and charming in her blatant pursual of our hero.  She is of course a raving beauty with her rumored about gypsy blood and has the special coloring that only a few of the Malory clan possess.  Warren is the least likely candidate of any young woman's affections: dark, brooding, and unhappy, shaped by the events of his past (of course).  Amy's bold declaration of her inetent at the very beginning of the story sets the tone for the fast paced occurrneces and adventures early on.   <br /> <br />It is not as unrealistic as many reviewers are saying, simply because her personality follows the theme that she has the \\"gift\\" of just knowing things that are meant to be, and so, she follows her instincts about Warren and wins his love.  You can read more about Amy's \\"talent\\" in The Present.  However, I will concede that the age difference is a bit much...but c'est la vie! <br /> <br />I liked this novel and the leading characters far more than I enjoyed Regina's story...which of course is considered a classic and the first of the series.  The Magic of You is a quick and enjoyable read and highly recommeded.	2005-08-06

A quarter of the way through, I realized the story was painfully familiar as I was certain I already knew this tale...why did images of Harrison Ford keep popping into my head?  I finally made the connection to \\"BladeRunner\\" and went on reading.  It is not the best of ideas to compare source material to film versions.  Each has it's own special qualities and needs to be viewed as seperate entities.    The book is far deeper and explores many interesting themes that the movie only touched upon.  There is an ongoing underlying tone of religion and purpose in life.  The quality of \\"empathy\\" being the only feature that distinguishes humans from the androids is one that makes the reader take pause.  If you feel this emotion, then you are indeed human...but how does one contend with the \\"killing\\" of the rogue androids that look and seem so real and not suffer the consequences as if you had commited murder?  Herein lies Deckard's dilemma.    The religious undertones are evident in the human's faith in \\"Mercerism\\"...a type of oneness someone can feel when experiencing the uphill battle of a man climbing a mountain and being struck down by rocks as he reaches the top, only to start his journey again.  The book decribes this as a way for all earthly humans to feel unification with one another and the trials of struggling through life. Truth be told, this is a profoundly depressing concept!    There is a big brother aspect here too.  The television plays one particular show 24/7 broadcasted from the colonies and one that all humans seem to watch as if they cannot get enough of it...it seems to be a slow paced and redundant broadcast that, in a strange way, feels brainwashing is taking place, showing only one side of life and urging all earth bound folk to make there way to the colonies where life is infinitely better.  Not so.  At one point, this program does its utmost to crush Mercerism as being a complete fraud of a belief.    The empathy factor is ongoing as well.  The need for humans to own animals (real or electric) seems to be an important status symbol as owning houses and cars are for us today.    This post nuclear world is dark and depressing with a sense of nothingness that appears to be taking over.  Yet, society still exisits on earth.  People are living sparse yet purposeful lives, however one gets the sense of even more emptiness and a lack of purpose in the colonies.  This is an \\"us and them\\" story on two levels: humans vs. androids as well as earth dwellers vs. colony dwellers.    Philip K. Dick has written a story with substance and philosophy.  Yes, there is action plotline, but there are deeper messages abound.	2005-08-06

The collection of short stories in this book are wonderful.  Each tale has its own charm and many include the familiar caharcters of Dr. Lanning and \\"cold as sttel\\" Dr. Calvin.  The earliest story was written in 1942, and although it might be considered \\"dated\\", it certainly isn't.  It's quite difficult to put down as the stories are fast paced and intersting the whole way through.  If you are a robot fan, or an Asimov lover, or reader of classic sci-fi, this title is not to be missed!	2005-07-16

However, the disturbing elements of slavery, incest, and cannibalism cetainlty transcend time. <br /> <br />As for the storyline, it is inetersting and well put together.  This book seemed to me like two stories in one.  The first half could be entitled \\"The Survivalist Guide After the Complete Destruction of the World as We Know It\\" and I shall be certain to take this book with me for reference in the (un)liklihood I ever find myself in a bomb shelter or lost in the woods.   <br /> <br />The story finally takes a turn halfway through when we are introduced to the inhabitants of this future Earth.  The \\"color war\\" has taken a turn and now dark skinned folk are the masters and the light skinned people are the slaves.  This new world is explained in detail as well as how the caste system works. <br /> <br />Our main characters adapt as best as they can according to their individual personalities.  I do not entirely agree that there is nothing to like about Farnham's clan.  It is a cross section of the kind of personalities that make up the world: leaders, fighters, followers, cowards, dependants, etc.  The strong survive and the weak get sucked into and accept their lot (even learn to like it).   <br /> <br />The time travel twist is one of the only features that make this title \\"sci-fi\\".  Other than that, it can be looked upon as any other interesting work of fiction. <br /> <br />If you can muddle through the first half of the book, dense with dialogue and technicalities that will make your head spin, you're in for a good read.  This book will make you think and consider how different a world can be if roles were reversed and democracy was no more. <br /> <br />	2005-07-09

This book is the sequel to \\"Devil's Honor\\" (another great read)with Justin's brother Clayton and Marisa as our hero and heroine.  This story begins with a love at first sight drama and is a little different than most formula romances.  Clayton and Marisa get together almost immediately, but are torn apart before their wedding due to some miscommunication.  Through most of the body of the book you are witnessing the longing of these two people who have never gotten over each other and whose love still burns strong after 7 years.   <br /> <br />Marisa is a refreshing character in her honesty, spunk, and humor.  She offsets Clayton's stoic self perfectly.  The story is indeed a true romance...the consumation of their love does not happen until near the end.  But that's the beauty of this book...you don't miss it as you are so engaged in the wonderful writing and characters. <br /> <br />It's a shame that many of Ms. Dier's great stories are no longer in print and difficult to find.  I was able to get this title in a used book store.  The same goes for \\"Devil's Honor\\", \\"Lord Savage\\", \\"MacLaren's Bride\\" and my all time favorite \\"The Sorcerer's Lady\\".  If you can pick these other titles up, you will be a happy romance reader...they are all good stories!	2005-07-04

This is one of my all time favorite romance novels.  Sure, it's a bit sappy at times, but the romance aspect will certainly make you wish you had a man like \\"Connor\\" in your life.  Laura's character left a bit to be desired, but for me, it didn't take too much away from the story itself.  It's full of intrigue, drama, love, and even some humor thrown in for good measure.

I have always loved Regina's character, and this being her book was what made it enjoyable.  However, I really didn't care for Nicholas at all, nor the storyline.  It was lacking in so many aspects...a loose story, an unconvincing love, and characters that weren't developed well enough.  In fact, you get to know and like Regina more throughout the next few books in the series than you do here which is odd.  That being said, if you are looking to read the Malory series, you really should start with this title.  You will like the books more and more as you read on...	2005-05-21

The story is great, the characters endearing, and the dialogue witty and engaging.  I laughed my way through this book thoroughly enjoying the main characters' constant bantering, which in itself was foreplay.   <br /> <br />Georgina \\"George\\" Anderson is a lovely heroine and the reader can really see her growth from young miss to woman through the telling of this story.  She is a good match for James, the rakehell gentleman ex-pirate (and Anthony's brother). George is able to keep up the verbal sparring with James and isn't the least bit intimidated by him.  Her journey into womanhood had even helped her to stand up to her brothers, the sister-adoring Anderson Five...who had a devilishly good time giving James his comeupance. <br /> <br />We meet likeable characters in the Anderson family who will play a role in future Malory novels. <br /> <br />All in all, Gentle Rogue is the best of this wonderful series and a classic that should be kept on the shelf for future re-reads. <br /> <br />	2005-05-15

There are a lot of talented authors out there in this genre with interesting tales to tell, but Johanna Lindsey's Malory clan is a genuine classic.   <br /> <br />Roz and Anthony's story is no exception.  It was even better the second time around.  The story is interesting and the love genuine...even if Roz's mistrust of our hero does drag out a bit!  There is no need to go into a long synopsis of this story, as it just needs to be read and enjoyed.   <br /> <br />Ms. Lindsey has a great knack for consistently bringing all the well-loved members of the family into each book.  As the reader, you really feel involved in the lives of each and every Malory.  It's also wonderful the way the author sets the reader up for the next installment \\"Gentle Rogue\\" and makes the avid romance fan need to begin book 3 as soon as the last page of number 2 is finished. <br /> <br />	2005-05-14

Danny is an endearing and unconventional character and one you do not tend to see in historical romances.  The story was interesting to a point, but the long awaited tale of Jeremy fell short.   <br /> <br />I certainly didn't like Jeremy as much as I did when he was introduced to readers at a young age as James' son.  He just wasn't interesting, he wasn't deep, and I didn't feel the charm of this Malory as much as is evident in Ms. Lindsey's other stories about this well loved family. We as readers are used to the Malory men being manly.  It seemed the only thing Jeremy had going for him was his good looks and relation with his notorious rakehell family.  He didn't appear to be able to do a thing for himself, but rather had to have his entire family solve problems for him. <br /> <br />This story is about our heroine and that is the magic here.  Jeremy, I felt, was just thrown in for good measure.  Having the other members of the family being supporting characters was another saving grace.  Johanna Lindsey is a great author and so this wasn't an \\"empty\\" story...just not one of her best.	2005-05-07

This was not one of her best works, but it was enjoyable all the same.  The characters were certainly well shaped and the plotline interesting.  I especially liked the twist of Lord \\"Bloody\\" Stewart's \\"gift\\" of second sight as it added an extra bit of intrigue to the novel.   <br /> <br />I only had one problem with the willing suspension of disbelief that most readers have to face in order to become encompassed by a work of fiction. To me, it was utterly unbelievable that our heroine made it through catching the plague and all the gruesome lovliness that came with it, and still remain pregnant!   <br /> <br />All in all, I would recommend this title to Romance readers and Henley fans alike.  However, I will always be partial to Ms. Henley's earlier works, namely (as I like to call them) the \\"And the...and the\\" series: The Pirate and the Pagan, The Falcon and the Flower, The Raven and the Rose etc.	2005-05-01

I kept it on my shelf as I re-read the trilogy before diving into the new book.  I enjoyed the different stories for the most part.  I liked Lucivar and Marian's courtship and the story of Saetan's past revealing his Warlord nature and power.  The continuation of Daemon and Janelle's life was disappointing to me.  Yes, it gave some closure to The Queen of the Darkness, but it lacked the potency and creativity I have come to expect from Ms. Bishop's writing...especially in these stories.    I would of course be interested in reading anything else she decides to write in this realm.  I actually would love to see a story about the creation of the Dragons and how they came to be and how they decide what witch or prince gets their birthright jewel, what the offering to the Darkness entails...just a thought.

In addition to Kara and Brynda'a stories, the mystery of Kyra's long lost sister(introduced in the first novel) was further explored.  In many ways, \\"Conquest\\" developed the stories' characters more thoroughly than Ms. Black was able to do in her longer novels, and for the first time, (especially in \\"No Fear\\") it wasn't just one lusty scene after another, but instead the romance aspect seemed to be in the spotlight.

The Empress' New Clothes had it's good and bad points.  First the good: a new and interesting world is depicted for the reader complete with  exciting and lusty scenes.  However, the bad seemed to outweigh the good.  I felt the character development was minimal and no matter how often the main characters professed their love for one another, I didn't buy it for a second!!  It does take a while to get used to the idea of this male dominated society and one does wonder why the women who were not originally from this \\"planet\\" or \\"dimension\\" seemed to acclamate so easily to being stripped of their rights as well as their clothes!  Personally, I preferred A.N. Roquelaure's (a.k.a. Anne Rice) Sleeping Beauty trilogy for an extreme erotica fix.  However, the Trek Mi Q'an series is different and worth the read if you are looking to get away from \\"Formula Romance\\" novels.	2005-01-07

And of course, in the process, he loses his \\"heart\\" to Gabby as well. <br /> <br />The story takes us through the city of Chicago and across the ocean to Scotland, where we are reacquainted with the MacKeltar brothers (sigh) who are quite eager to help Adam (as they owe him a great debt for saving Daegus' life). <br /> <br />No spoilers here, folks.  This is just a great novel with tons of fun, intrigue, romance, and the special touches that are unique to Karen Marie Moning's writings. All her books are fabulous and highly recommended...but definitely try to read the books in order to get the full effect of \\"The Immortal Highlander\\". <br /> <br />	2004-08-17

The characters were nicely developed and the story far more interesting.  The romance aspect was sweet, although the love scenes were rather tame.  The ending was terribly unbelievable...in that everyone is forgiven quite easily for past wrong-doings no matter how awful: the jilted fiance, the abused and abandoned son, etc.  And sorry to nitpick, but the cover model was an unappealing brunette, while the story portrayed our hero as a dashing blond pirate. <br /> <br />However, the book flowed well and it was an easy and light read.  I will sample more of Ms. Macgregor's books, but I think I like her writing as Sherilyn Kenyon better.	2004-08-07

The characters are likable, and the heroine is reminiscent of Julie Garwood's historical women (sweet and outspoken in their innocence).  It's the typical romance formula: the gruff, unyeilding warrior with no emotion allows the sweet, beautiful, virgin Lady to break down his defenses and give him the ability to love.  This story is not earth-shattering or terribly memorable, but it's a perfect book to bring along for a day at the beach.	2004-08-02

This was Ms. Lindsey's poorest effort to say the least. The characters were uninteresting, the plotline thin, the love unconvincing...and I found myself struggling to complete the story in hopes of finding some redeeming feature. Alas, there was none to be found.      I would still recommend Lindsey's work, just skip this title.	2004-07-29

If you're looking for an incredible read that keeps you turning the pages voraciously, this is the trilogy to get! Ms. Bishop is a shining star in the world of fantasy and sci-fi. The characters and multi-level plotlines became more intriguing as the stories progressed, The world Ms. Bishop has created is so complete, one could seriosuly believe the author has some secret knowledge of it's true existence. I did find the first few chapters to be a bit confusing as there are so many rules and characters that are presented, but once you get through the beginning, everything flows, makes sense, and captivates the reader. There is a healthy mixture of suspense, adventure, love, and even aspects that are morbidly fascinating. In my humble opinion, you are not going to want this series to end and you'll be thinking of the story long after you've read the last page. I have high hopes for Ms. Bishop to write more stories that take place in the Jeweled realms. The author has written The Invisible Ring. It is a nice story that does take place in this world and you do see some familiar characters. However, it wasn't as riviting as the trilogy.  Read the Black Jewels Trilogy.  You'll be glad you did!	2004-07-26

The story is most definitely unique and engaging and our hero is certainly scrumptouously sexy in his darkness.  However, I just didn't warm up to the heroine, Chloe.  I feel Ms. Moning didn't develop this character as fully as she did Gwen in KOTH. As a result, this story misses the complete \\"romance\\" aspect.  I couldn't say \\"Yes! These characters were meant to be together above all others\\", but rather felt that they shared a mere fondness for one another and a whole lot of attraction.  If you are looking for an intriguing and more complex plotline, this book is wonderful.  If you want heart-stopping love and romance, you may feel a little short-changed.  If you desire the whole romance package complete with a great storyline, read KOTH.  All in all, The Dark Highlander makes for an enjoyable read and is certainly one of the better novels written in this genre.	2004-06-04

After reading hundreds of romance novels by countless authors, I can honestly say it doesn't get any better than this, folks!  There are not enough words to express the perfection of this story.  After my second readthrough, I am just as enchanted as I was initially.  Karen Marie Moning has found the optimim blend of adventure, humor, love and passion that will captivate you from cover to cover, and have you thinking about it long after you're done. You cannot help but fall in love with the characters created in this book...main and supporting alike.  Ms. Moning has shown her true genius in this genre by developing a tale that will have you eagerly turning the pages, revelling in it's creativity, giggling at it's humor, sighing at the romance, and panting at the passion!  I have read all the books in this series, and whereas they all have their own specific charms, this is the book I will keep on the shelf for easy access and future reads.  Can't wait for her long overdue next installment &quot;The Immortal Highlander&quot; scheduled to be out Summer 2004.  Well done!	2004-06-03
