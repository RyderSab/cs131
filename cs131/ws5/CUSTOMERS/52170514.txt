I had the honor of meeting Ms. Evanovich and she says she has a lot more to come. I am a big fan of this series but this book was preditable with every page I turned.  Sorry....

I first want to say that I'm a big Evanovich fan.  I couldn't wait for the release of this book and I had it pre-ordered from the first day it was available ... I am so disappointed. Like most everyone else I feel the book was over priced for a book under 150 pages. I was expecting a &quot;complete&quot; novel.  I was hoping for a story the caliber of Evanovich's previous novels.  It almost seems that Evanovich took her previous Stephanie Plum stories  and changed the name of characters just enough to a give the book a Christmas theme.<br />Most of all I didn't get my &quot;Morreli&quot; fix and Ranger was not in this story.  I think Diesel was Stephanie's fantasy of Ranger ... in disguised, as a super hero.<br />If you are an Evanovich fan ... I would read the book.  I would not recommend this book to a new reader.	2002-11-10

I am a die hard Evanovich fan and I had a hard time getting into this book.  When I finally made up mind that this is not the \\"Stephanie Plum\\" series and a fluffed up book of Evanovich's earlier writing...  I allowed myself to go with the flow and enjoyed what I could.<br />I found myself feeling embarrassed for the author. It is ashamed that this book was not edited properly.  Besides the Nick/Neil mistakes there was Detective Ferrell/Farrell misspelling and a few other obvious mistakes.  I have to admit that the carelessness taken to produce this book made me feel a little taken.<br />On a positive note ... the book was a cute fantasy story.  Being a single mom at one time it was fun to fantasize that there would be someone like Nick, a knight in shining armor, that would fall in love with the \\"whole package.\\"  And, at least there was enough humor in the book to leave a smile on my face.<br />I can't say that I will recommend this book like I have most of her others.  I love Evonovich and that is the only reason this book gets a 3.  I hope \\"Visions of a Sugar Plum.\\" will hold up to her previous high standards.	2002-09-27

I could not put this book down so I  stayed up and read it from cover to cover.<br />The story begins with a baby being abandoned late one night by a teenage girl and the father of the baby. The baby is dressed in a flannel shirt with a hair clip on its umbilical cord and left by the garage in a cardboard box.<br />The box is then found by Skip, a house hand.  Skip has never been around children much less a baby.  He takes the newborn in as his own and the story begins.  He becomes attached to the baby and raises it as his own... all the while keeping it a secret.  We are then swept along as Skip learns to care for the baby and ends up dedicating his life to the baby. (I don't want to give up to much information on the baby.)<br />The name of the estate where the baby is left is called &quot;Blessings&quot; ... owned by an eighty-year-old wealthy woman named Lydia Blessings.  As the story continues we learn the secrets of Lydia Blessings and her family ... AND, there are many secrets! The characters are richly written ... you will find yourself bonding with many of them as you learn their secrets.  BUT, be prepared for some tears ... keep the Kleenex close at hand.<br />There are many &quot;BLESSINGS&quot; in this story.  You will not be disappointed with this novel.  It is a must read.	2002-09-22

If it were not that this book was written for charitable purposes ... I probably wouldn't have given it 3 stars.  I was hard press to find three stories that were worth reading from beginning to end.<br />I did enjoy looking for the &quot;thick&quot; book, steak and fog in each story.  In most of the stories it seemed that the authors stuck in the 3 elements listed as an after thought.  The stories I enjoyed most were stories where there was some thought put into the plot.<br />Because this book was written for charity, I would encourage others to purchase it, read and review it.	2002-09-15

BUT, she came back in \\"Hard Eight!\\" The reason I read this series is for pure enjoyment. If you are looking for suspense or a thriller you won't find it here...what you will find is a contiuation of Steph's cars being stolen or blown up, dead bodies, people breaking into her apartment, Lula's and Grandma Mazur's zany humor as well as the on going sexual tension Steph has with Morelli and Ranger.  My favorite is the interaction between Steph and Morelli.  I can't get enough of those two!<br />In every book you will find new crazy chartacters.  In this book it is Albert Kloughn (clown), the rabbit, bear and men running around with Clinton and Nixon mask.  Valerie, Stephanie's sister showed up in \\"7 Up\\" and is continuing in \\"Hard Eight ... I'm thinking we will  see her develop more in upcoming story lines.<br />I won't recap the story again because other reviewers have done a wonderul job.  What I will say is ... if you want a quick enjoyable read ... this is the book for you. If need a \\"pick up\\" in your day ... \\"pick up\\" Evanovich and you won't go wrong.	2002-09-08

I started the \\"PLUM\\" series this summer and have scrambled to get my hands on everything that she has written.  I think all the books are enjoyable and sooooo funny!  BUT, this one was my least favorite.  Aside of Stephanie's on going battle with Joyce Barnhardt and Bob, the dog, poop episodes ... I didn't find as much humor in this book as I have in the her other books.  Also, I didn't get enough of Morrelli in this book.  I love the interaction between Joe and Stephanie.  I would have like to have gotten more in this book.<br />Now that I've said that, you have to know that, you will enjoy this book.  There are all the great chartacters that thread from book one to seven.  You will laugh and all though the book is not suspenseful you will find that this is a page turner.... When will Stephanie capture Eddie DeCooch? What does she have that everyone wants?  Will she find Dougie and Mooner? AND, most of all will she marry Morelli or surcum to Ranger.  It's a must read in the series!	2002-09-03

I started at \\"One For The Money\\" and I just can't get enough.  I absolutely love this series ... if not for any other reason than a smile and a laugh!<br />In this book we are introduced to \\"Bob.\\"  No, not another love interest for Stephanie but a great addition to her life.<br />The last page of \\"High Five\\" left me saying \\"no!\\" Don't stop here! ... Which man, Morelli or Ranger, would Stephanie succumb to.  Thank goodness I had \\"Hot Six\\" ready to go or I would have gone crazy waiting.<br />As I said before, I love this series. The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because the storyline in all the books are the same with a new twist.  AND, the chartacters seem to be the same with different names.  BUT, that doesn't mean that you won't get optimum enjoyment out this book or any of the previous books in the series.<br />In each book Stephanie, the bounty hunter, is bound to be shot at or her car is mutilated in some manner ... I guess the question is who will do it?<br />The chartacters, Morelli, Ranger, Grandma Mazur, Lula, Rex and now \\"Bob\\" are all familiar throughout every book.  Oh, don't forget mom and dan, uncle Vinnie and Connie too! I feel like I know all these chartacters personally.<br />I love Stephanie's relationship with Morelli.  From Book One to Six they have been developing slowly but surely. I think they are good together!	2002-08-31

I found myself captivated once again. Evanovich did it again ... she grabbed me and kept me turning page after page.  As I was reading the last line of the last page my mouth dropped open and I heard myself say out loud &quot;NO!&quot;<br />What a wonderful series to read.  You will never want for more colorful chartacters, romance, and laughter as Stephanie Plum &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; coninues her saga.  Her love interest with Moralli is a continuing thread throughtout the series BUT in this book we learn of a new possibility ... could there be someone else in Stephanie's life?

It is written from a murdered little girls point of view ... from heaven.  The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because I would have liked to have had a more pleasent view of what heaven was like for her.  I think if Sebold was going to place her in heaven she should have given us a little more visual AND maybe for our own reasons ... some hope that heaven is everything we are taught it will be.  Then, on the other hand, heaven may be thought of differently by others and that is what she conveyed.<br />This book gave me a lot to think about.  It's strange how this book came out at a time when we have had so many children, especially little girls abducted and/or murdered.  I can only hope that from heaven these children can guide us and those who protect us to find these awful people that commit such heinous crimes.<br />I noticed in some of the comments that some people think this book is about God because it refers to heaven.  When really this book is about a life taken to early. The way the book is written ... I got so enthrolled in the girls thoughts that I thought they were my own thoughts.<br />I like knowing that (even if it just a story) those in heaven can still follow us throughout our lives.  BUT, then, it saddens me that some souls can be unsettled ... at least until their murders are found.  Very interesting plot.  I would definetely recommend this book.  I think if is carefully scripted it would make a great movie.	2002-08-25

It wasn't until the last 100 pages that I actually enjoyed it. Three-quarters of the book seems to repeat itself making it a bit boring and hard to get through.<br />The setting for the book is in Los Angeles.  I live in Southern California and I feel that Keyes really exagerated what she &quot;imagined&quot; L.A. is like. Some of what she writes does happen but so much is sterotype ... things we may have heard or seen on an &quot;Entertainment Show.&quot;<br />I am a first time Keyes reader so I wasn't familiar with all of the chartacters.  Keyes does have knack for writing colorful and enjoyable chartacters.<br />Maggie, the main chartacter, was given just about every senerio life can bring ...

Did Ellie not like \\"fast food?\\" It had to be cheaper than eating out at the Inn most of the time.<br />The obvious, is that her sister's murder took a toll on her and I'm sure she must have matured a lot sooner than most girls. Finding your sister dead at 7 years of age in itself would have aged anyone.<br />I found myself a little confused with her financial situation.  On one hand we were led to beleive she had to watch her finances because she would be losing her job in Atlanta but then on the other hand ... she sure spent a lot on eating out, renting a car and staying at the Inn.  That book deal must have covered a lot of her expenses ... because according to Ellie she didn't have much in her savings.  Thank goodness she only had to pay Alfie $1,000.00 for his information.<br />I had hoped that the author would have developed the \\"love\\" relationship between her and Peter a little more. It came off as an after thought.<br />Maybe I'm being picky or I expected to much perfection in this book...<br />Because all and all the book was entertaining.	2002-05-07

This book had everything I was looking for ... an easy read, page turning, and fun.  Of course this is a murder mystery so there were a few pages when her employers were murdered that were just a little graghic.<br />I enjoyed the strong, independent nature of the chartacter ... Sarah.  BUT even though she was strong there was a balance of softness and vunerability to her....<br />The only flaw I could find in the storyline was with security systems in Sarah's employer's home.  My question would be ... if they are so wealthy, why couldn't they afford video security camera's? Ms Howard spoke a lot to how secure all the homes were. so it didn't make sense that the murder was not on film and could me caught sooner.  You would think with past death threat to the Judge, this would be a must.<br />In any case ... the book was enjoyable.  I couldn't put it down.<br />I would definetly read \\"Dying to Please.\\"	2002-04-30
