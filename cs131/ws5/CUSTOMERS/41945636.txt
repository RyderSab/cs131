Based on the Mysterious characters known as Techno-Mages who &quot;use science to create Magic&quot; We learn how the Mages work their Magic? With the aid of a programmable alien symbiotic implant at the base of thier skulls, of course. With it they can acomplish the same feats as the Wizards and Sorcerers in the Fantasy Novels. Endless streams of exploding fireballs, protective shields around their bodies, invisible highspeed platforms of levitation for movement, holographic dragons. Guided by the Circle and dedicated to the code. We also learn that Techno Mages go through various levels of training such as apprentis, chrystalis, initiate then Mage, apparently each candidate spends a couple of years at each stage. But now a new initiate (Galen the charactar from B5 &amp; Crusade) Has discovered the long lost spell of distruction. Just as a large and unusual and sudden amount of activity is being detected on the rim. maybe the Shadows? I've heard from B5 websites that the Techno Mages where made up of numerous different species? but these Novels only describe human and centauri.	2004-05-30

So thats why the series was titled &quot;The Passing of the Techno Mages.&quot; I'm rather dissapointed! O.K. Volume 1 introduced us to the Mysterious characters that where introduced on the B5 and Crusade t.v. series's. We learn they accomplish their magic with the aid of an alien implant called a chrystalis. Volume 2 We learn the secret history of the alien implants, they come from the Shadows; planners and instigators of chaos and war, eternal enemies of the Vorlons. Volume 3 We learn how the Shadows sadistically produce the chrystalis (by kidnapping different species and letting it grow and fester on them and slowly draining the life out of the host.) Now comes the somber ending, Galen with the help of the spell of destruction and John Sheridan, destroy the homeworld of the Shadows and since the Shadows are the only ones that produce the Tech and the Mages don't know how! It's &quot;the passing of the Techno Mages&quot;. Kinda dissapointing.	2004-05-30

The Coptic, Armenian, Eithiopian Churches are not considered Eastern Orthodox because they are Oriental Orthodox which is something different.

He inherited only an institutional understanding of the Church, and saw salvation solely as an \\"indiviual\\" matter despite Matt 18:20. Now, no human oraganization can save. But Moody never witnessed nor understood the Church as a Divine-human Community, Moody couldn't see how someone was redeemed 'in' the Body of Christ. To him it was a personal matter. Moody logically did not call the new disciple to see his commitment to Christ as an equal commitment to his brethren in the 'ekklesia'. The new convert was only taught that his primary concern was to \\"win the lost\\" and maintain his own private holiness. Salvation is not instant Philippians 2:12[in this verse the word is 'salvation' NOT santification] and 3:12 reveal this. As for reviewer Eric Dahlbeck is conscerned he doesn't want you to know about Romans 2:6-13, (JAMES 2:17), Titus 3:8, Acts 10:35, 2 Corinth 5:10, 1 Peter 4:7-11. And I invite him to e-mail me.

Books	5	4	15	N	N	Good Defence Against Sola Scriptura	The Bible has never been, nor can ever be, the sole standard of defence and definition of Christian faith and practise. There are those who believe in a perfect Bible but still disagree on the Lord's Supper (memorial/real presence), views on war(just war/pacifism), salvation (predestination/free-will), eternal security (once saved alwas saved/self determination), baptism's significants (nonessential/essential) and method of administration(infant/adult,immertion/sprinkling), etc. Neither the doctrine of inerrancy (i.e. everything it teaches is true) or perfection (that man wrote word for word what God dictated to him) makes the Bible's meaning automatic, nor does either guarentee its correct interpretations. Realize that for centuries, the early church had no clearly defined canon. In the early church the NT was NOT AN (A RELIGIOUS REFERENCE BOOK), it was something that they were living. Their Covenant was not a covenant to paper, but to a Person-Jesus Christ. Neither did the believer need a Script in hand to \\"bear witness\\" of Him, His presence in their midst was their greatest witness (Matt 28:18)The Orthodox Church's interpretation of Scriptures echoes the experience of God's people everywhere throughout all ages. In short, if someone tries telling you that salvation is somehow easy, simple and cheap run don't walk in the other direction.

But the Son became the ONE MEDIATOR by becoming MAN through the Holy Spirit and a virgin-that is, through God and men. He \\"built\\" His humanity not from Himself alone but from another, the Virgin Mary. Likewise, as the MEDIATOR He says, \\"I will build MY church\\" (Matt 16:18); He establishes her leaders and her worship. As Mary gives us Christ in His humanity, the Church introduces us to Him, who alone is our MEDIATOR. Also read Luke 1:26-56 The Holy Virgin Mary Theotokos stands as the greatest example of mankind's free responce to God's offer of salvation. She stands as an example of God's will and mankind's acceptence. Mary could have refused but she accepted. She was an active participant in both the Mystery of God's will and the redemptive process of mankind's salvation. This is why she is venerated with great love and esteem. However, there are many like reviewer(Gregory Nyman) Who believe the Lord failed in Matt 16:18-19 & Ephesians 4:4-6. NO Mary = No Jesus.

I like being a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church because the Roman Catholics are alwas adding to Christianity and the Protestants are alwas taking away. The Eastern Orthodox Church (the Church that gave the world the Bible)has never felt or seen the need for such heresy because they have alwas maintained the original true doctine of christ, \\"that he is the same yesterday, today and forever.\\" It must be noted that in the the schism of 1054a.d. the Roman Catholic Church choose to leave the Church founded by Christ himself and Luther seriously mis-interpreted what Paul said and ment when he(Martin Luther) created the tradition of faith alone (Sola Fide)as many Protestant biblical theologians have concluded see: [Paul and Palestinian Judaism by E.P.
