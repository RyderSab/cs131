Books	5	3	3	N	N	Love Learning	Susan  Lendroth's WHY EXPORE? repeats this basic question of human existence at the beginning of each section.  Sometimes a parent asks a child why she must go far from home and other times a younger person asks his elder why she or he researches ancient junk (archeology), dirty water (microscopic organisms), invisible matter (sub-atomic particles), etc.  Some people sought adventure, but others a better life, and still others knowledge.      WHY EXPLORE, told in rhyme, looks at the joys of learning new things.  It subtly encourages the reader to think, to grow, to have a passion for knowing.  At the end of the book, more details are given about various discoveries and quests for knowledge.   Enrique S. Moreiro's muted oil painting illustrations are at times epic and at times sparse.

Virginia Hamilton adds a voice that is full. It is deep and loving. Most of the stories have a bit of verse or song. Each tale ends with the teller speaking the moral plainly to the children listening. For example, &quot;How Bruh Sparrow and Sis Wren Lost Out&quot; ends, &quot;So, children, here's a leaf from the book of birds: Pick on your own size. For it's no use squabbling over what's too big for you to handle.&quot; I think these tales would be perfect for the mid to upper elementary audience as well as for adults.  <br />  <br /> There is a table of contents, but the stories are in no apparent order and are not grouped. Barry Moser's vibrant watercolor illustrations are not necessary for the storytelling. However, having seen them, it is hard to imagine the story without them.  <br />  <br /> Source Notes: The Afterword helps readers and tellers know the history and origins of these Southern, African-American tales. The stories in When Birds Could Talk & Bats Could Sing were originally written down by Martha Young who wrote them in the so-called black dialect of the plantation era. It is impossible to tell now which stories she heard from African American's and which she wrote herself. These stories are written in the prose style called cante fable. They include verse or song and end with a moral for children. <br />  <br /> There is an entire page detailing and crediting the book designers and artists who helped put this book together.  <br /> Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-26

The stories are divided into three groups: for ages 5 or 6, 7 or 8, and 9 or 10. The older group could also enjoy reading the stories. <br />  <br /> The source notes, though brief, are detailed. The authors list the history of the tale and in many cases who they first heard it from. <br />  <br /> The &quot;Afterword for parents, teachers, and librarians&quot; discusses the importance of storytelling and what to be careful of when telling scary stories. <br />  <br /> There is a useful guide to pronunciation. <br /> Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-26

Introduction: Alison Lurie, a professor at Cornell University wrote the preface. She sums up a hundred years of American Fairy Tales and introduces the stories in two pages.      Organization: There is a table of contents and the stories appear to be arranged chronologically. The illustrations by Michael McCurdy are simple black and white ink drawing and scratch boards that remind me of illustrations I saw in hundred year old periodicals.       The stories themselves: The stories vary as much as the authors. Some, like Feathertop, are quite literary. Here is an example sentence. &quot;'Poor fellow!' quothe Mother Rigby, with a rueful glance at the relics of her ill-fated contrivance.&quot; As written, these stories may be better read than told. The stories are also fairly long so a teller might need to trim them.       Source Notes: Each story starts with a lengthy source note that includes some critique and history. The Afterword by Neil Phillip is long, detailed, and scholarly. Phillip states that he chose to look at literary tales with a named author for this collection. He critiques and puts the stories into their historical framework. He looks at the broad changes seen in the hundred years that he covers.       Final Thoughts: This is a very scholarly look at American fairy tales. Sadly, most Americans are probably not familiar with more than one or two of these stories. This book would make an excellent text book for a high school or college English class and should be required reading.   Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-26

She points out that this book will help storytellers acquire the skills of a good storyteller.  <br /> <br />Just Enough to Make a Story is full of good, practical advice. It is also a super resource. It contains a number of complete stories and themed lists of stories. Schimmel starts off with several chapters on the basics of storytelling. Then she moves on to the stories. Next she discusses where to use stories and why to use stories. Finally she introduces several themes with annotated lists of stories.  <br /> <br />The stories included are very tell-able as written. There are also illustrations and detailed instructions for several paper folding stories. One story, The Pancake, is for two tellers. This book includes sources and stories for all ages.  <br /> <br />The source notes are fabulous. They include where the story came from or how she came by the idea for an original story. Schimmel notes if there are various versions and in what book the stories can be found.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book. There is good advice from a seasoned teller. The resources are also very useful. My only criticism of this book is that the font is too small. I would prefer that this book was a large trade book size.  <br />Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-26

Primarily the story dealt with the unraveling of the ties that bind the dysfunctional Olivette family together. Edith, the mother, made &quot;finding herself&quot; a full time job. The oldest daughter, Marley, was self-centered and constantly ranting and raving. Daniel, the father, fell head-over-heels in lust with Marley's college roommate, Persia. The only person acting like a responsible adult was the youngest daughter, Sophie. Sophie felt like her life had turned into a soap opera. The author provided a solid and ordinary family to compare with the Olivettes. Ted and his family were very down-to-earth people. The parents acted like adults and they were caring and respectful of one another.  <br />  <br /> Tune in Anytime described some outlandish events. However, I felt like the characters and events could have been real. In my mind, I could imagine the evening news describing the final scene. I almost dropped the book because I was laughing so hard.  <br />  <br /> I would recommend Tune in Anytime to all young adults, but especially to anyone who is dealing with divorce. Children going through a divorce will be able to relate to Sophie's feeling that she was the only person in her family who was still a family. Everyone else was single.

Includes the scientific name for each tree and a cross reference to other states that have the same state tree. In those cases the information is not repeated, but additional information is provided. There is also an index, but it only contains the tree names. Some photo would be a welcome addition to the book. Karen Woodworth Roman, Children's Science Book Review	2004-07-20

For example, &quot;Plants cannot live without soil.&quot; To keep the book simple for the intended audience that sentence might have read, &quot;Few plants can live without soil.&quot; The photos could be improved with labels and some stock photos don't seem to be a perfect match for the book. I liked the &quot;Fact File&quot; and &quot;Can You Believe it?&quot; sections. Also contains a glossary, short bibliography, and index.

Explains why temperate forests only grow in certain regions. Very informative and well researched. I only had two small complaints. Every so often the author used a rather slangy phrase which seemed out of place. Second, I did not like the way some of the maps were arranged. Those maps have red numbers marking the large areas of forests in a country and then the reader has to look at a separate list to read about the forests. I found them the hardest part of the book to read and enjoy. KWR, Children's Science Book Review	2004-07-20

He lives with his master, treated like another son in the family.  Those were strange times of signs in the sky, revivals, and cults.  When strangers appear in town it seems they are some kind of menacing, religious folk.  Another stranger offers Albion a job at ten times the going rate and he goes with his master's approval.  He goes beyond the edge of civilization to a strange house ruled by a man with an iron fist.  There Albion is expected to use his gift at stonecutting to make a masterpiece for the lord of the house, but is he a guest artisan or is he a prisoner?  The story is skillfully told in diary format and captures a sense of dread and tension that builds to the climactic conclusion. Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-20

Give some good advice about reducing consumption, improving public transportation, and composting! In some places mentions a problem, but does not give details or speaks in over generalizations. For example, the books mentions how farming harms the soil, but does not go into details. Do all farmers harm the soil? How do farmers harm the soil? Even with these faults, I like the book fairly well. It is colorful and should get kids to think about the environment. The books has an interesting and busy layout.

The animals or, if a large animal, part of an animal is illustrated using handmade paper collage. What may sound like just a clever concept, when skillfully executed, resulted in an awesome book. Some of the animals shown are the pigmy shrew, atlas moth, dwarf goby, Goliath frog, and giant squid. The dimensions of the animal is noted and as well as a paragraph about such things as habitat and diet which makes this a very interesting book.

After seeing it, I had to read the book.  Don't expect it to be just like the movie, but I highly recommend both the book and the movie.  The basic question is can a girl be a Maori leader?  I really enjoyed learning more about Maori traditions and beliefs as well as the wisdom of  the elder characters.  For example, I thought the custom of burying the birth cord was fascinating. <br />The book had additional levels of folklore and mythology. I don't want to get into details as not to spoil the story, but I have a few general comments. I especially found the mother wise in naming the child and the play or power play between man and woman is a recurring theme. Karen Woodworth-Roman	2004-07-14

US	23360882	R39SR9HUSQCD4F	0811816753	365274538	Grimm's Grimmest	Books	4	7	9	N	N	Very Grimm Indeed	Maria Tatar introduces the stories and some of the variations in different editions. She also delves into the politics that have helped some stories become well known and helped keep others obscure. There is a table of contents, but the stories are in no discernable order. <br />This collection takes readers closer to the original tales and include incest, sex, and graphic violence. The stories are rough and sometimes hard to understand. For example, I could not understand why the daughter who had fled the castle and the incestuous advances of her father, the king, later purposefully let her identity be known to him. <br />These stories are excellent reading that should help tellers understand these folk tales better. They may be tellable as written to an adult audience. However, I feel that an audience that is not well-versed in the oral tradition my need some help in understanding them or putting them into context. <br />The illustrations have a lurid quality that intensifies the feeling of uneasiness.<br />Source Notes: Selected stories from the 3rd ed.

In a dark period of Japanese history, one man listened to his conscience, discussed the consequences with his wife and children, and chose to do the right thing. In the early days of WWII, Sugihara, a diplomat to Lithuania, issued thousands of life-saving visas to the Jews of Europe against the direct orders of his superiors. After the Russians took over Lithuania, Sugihara was forced to close the Japanese Embassy, but he continued writing visas until the last possible moment. <br />The rest of Sugihara's story is anti-climactic, dealing with his diplomatic career throughout the war. After the war, the Soviets sent the Sugihara family to a Siberian detention camp. When they were finally repatriated, Sugihara was immediately dismissed from government service for disobeying orders. He spent many years in obscurity before finally being found by some of the grateful Jews that he had saved. Near the end of his life, he received some well-deserved acknowledgement by both the Japanese and Israeli government including being recognized as \\"Righteous Among the Nations.\\"<br />Alison Leslie Gold, who has written several other non-fiction books of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust, tells the story of three families. Besides Sugihara's story, Gold describes the experience of a Jewish family from Poland and another from Lithuania who received Sugihara visas. Gold focuses on Solly and Masha, children from those families. She interviewed them as well as Sugihara's widow, Yukiko, for first hand accounts of the heroic and tragic events described in this book. Masha's family used their visa to travel to Japan and survived the war. Tragically, Solly's family repeatedly delayed using their visa until it was too late to use it resulting in many family members' deaths at the hands of the Nazis. Solly found it quite ironic that a Japanese man tried to offer his family assistance at the beginning of the war and the first American face thathe saw when he was liberated at the end of the war was a Japanese American soldier. <br />The photographs in the book help readers understand that this is a true story that happened to real people. There are photographs of all three families and additional photos from the time period. The photos are separated from the narrative in two clumps. Though this distracts from their impact, they are still powerful. <br />This is an easy to read introductory book on the incidents in Lithuania. However, I found information on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum web site that was not included in the book. In the web site's section on Sugihara, I learned about the interesting larger story involving the Dutch council, Jan Zwartendijk and his involvement in helping the Lithuanian Jews. I also learned that Yukiko was Sugihara's second wife.<br />Gold is non-judgmental towards Japan's involvement in WWII and of Sugihara's father's involvement in occupied Korea. However, she seems to lose some of that impartiality when she adds comments on Sugihara's conversion to Russian Orthadoxism. She adds the comment that he did not forget his Buddhism and Shinto religions from his youth (10). I wonder how she knows that detail of his conversion. <br />The research that went into A Special Fate could have been better documented. Gold's sources are summed up in an author's note at the beginning of the book and an author's acknowledgement at the end. The book does not include a bibliography for further reading or works consulted. <br />It is estimated that Sugihara wrote 6,000 visas. Now there is a group numbering over 40,000 descendants known as \\"Sugihara Survivors.\\" Even in later life, Sugihara remained a humble man and once said, \\"I didn't do anything special....I made my own decisions....I followed my own conscience and listened to it\\" (175). Yukiko also should be commended, because had she dissuaded her husband, he might not have written the visas that saved so many lives. Karen Woodworth-Roman, MS Library Science	2004-05-13

This is a story from Jay's childhood that reads like a monolog on the Tonight Show. Jay's dad is larger than life, but the characters feel like caricatures. Whitehead's colorful and detailed drawings also remind me of caricatures. While this is a loving family story, it contains some stereotypes about national origin. The book comes with a CD of Jay reading the story. Leno fans should buy this book.	2004-05-03

She is struggling to find her place in the rigid social structure of Jr. High.  It bothers her that she stands out as one of two Korean Americans at school.  She is at that age where she knows what she should do or say to her parents, but she also knows how to hurt them.  She is starting to grow up and not only think of her own feelings.  She is also noticing boys and they are noticing her.  <br />This is a story about assimilation, growing up, first love, and friendship.  I finished this book in one sitting.  It was interesting to read about the feelings of a recent Korean immigrant girl.  Tae is realistically not perfect, but she is growing as she experiences the joys and tribulations of Jr. High.	2004-04-30

It also mentions that stories are powerful teaching tools. <br />Stories are divided by local as in the case of Zen stories from Japan and by religious group as in Jewish or Christian tales. There are no illustrations except small decorative \\"borders\\" that divide the title from the story. <br />Most of the stories are short and simply told.  They appear quite tellable as written or they could be embellished. The tales are suitable for a variety of ages and some for all ages.  The stories are very good, but I suppose with so many stories to choose from, it must have been a hard selection process. <br />The source notes are a real treasure. Each section has some interesting background common to all the stories. Forest then describes the history of the tales and various sources. She says what she based her stories on but not how much she changed them. The several stories that I was familiar with do not appear to be greatly altered. <br />There is a list of proverbs from various countries.<br />I would recommend this book as a very good storytelling resource.	2004-04-29

US	23360882	R1MPSXHCPPGM7M	039922677X	111558895	Mysterious Tales of Japan	Books	5	4	5	N	N	EXCELLENT. I've told a few of these tales myself....	Most of the stories in Mysterious Tales of Japan were first recorded for Western readers by Lafcadio Hearn over a hundred years ago. Only Crane Maiden and Pine of Akoya are not based on Hearn's telling of the tales. Rafe Martin's collection is an excellent addition to Hearnian literature. Includes story notes detailing each story's origin. <br />In Rafe Martin's introduction, he notes his interest in Japan and some aspects of Japanese culture. He mentions that \\"Hearn's work was based on old literary collections, on the writings of Zen, on Buddhist and Shinto sources, and on the versions of the stories told to him by his Japanese wife and friends.\\"<br />There is a table of contents but the stories are not divided or ordered in any perceivable way. The illustrations by Tatsuro Kiuchi are not necessary, but they greatly enhance the stories. Before each tale there is a simple brush and ink illustration that illuminates the heart of the story. Each story also has a one page oil illustration. Some of the stories in this book also appeared in the classic Japanese movie Kwaidan. Those illustrations show a definite influence from the movie.<br />I find Rafe Martin's retelling of the stories to be excellent. Compared with other collections of Japanese folklore, they are more readable and maybe slightly embellished. My one minor peeve was that he chose to spell the Snow Woman's name Yuke (you-kay) instead of the proper Yuki (you-key) maybe in hopes of avoiding non-Japanese speakers mispronouncing her name as \\"Yucky.\\" <br />As many of these tales are ghost tales and there is some blood and gore, I think that they are suited for eight or nine years old and older. These stories are excellent read aloud, but are also enjoyable reading. <br />The source notes detail the origin and sometimes wider history of the tales. Rafe Martin also mentions how he has changed the tales and sometimes mentions his experiences of telling the stories.	2004-04-29

Though we are not birds, in a way it prepares us, the readers, for the wonder and mystery that is to follow. The stories are quite interesting. Each tale ends with an informative tidbit about the Saint. For example, \\"Saint Notburga is the patron saint of poor farmers and hired servants. Her feast day is September 14. Her emblem is the sickle.\\" <br />John Winch has made two types of illustrations in this book. Before each tale there is an intriguing representation of an artifact representing the Saint. One looks like a painting on wood, one looks like a small statue, another looks like a coin. These gray illustrations also mention the country and rough dates that the Saint lived. I like these symbolic illustrations even more than the colorful acrylic folk paintings that plainly detail the stories.<br />The verso mentions that \\"The author's principal source for this book is Butler's Lives of the Saints (New York: P.J. Kennedy & Sons, 1956).\\"<br />The author's note is brief and explains what makes a person a saint and the canonization process. The author concludes, \\"This process does not make a person a saint. Only God can do that. Through canonization, the church recognizes what God has already done.\\"	2004-04-20

US	23360882	R31YPLUJA4CIPR	0440419441	209726117	When My Name Was Keoko	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A well-crafted page turner	In 1940, by Japanese decree, Kim Sun-hee became known as Kaneyama Keoko. It was more than just the \\"Japanization\\" of her Korean name by changing the pronunciation. It was an attempt to wipe out her identity as a Korean, by forcing her to have a new Japanese name written with different kanji (Chinese characters).     Linda Sue Park's When My Name Was Keoko tells the historical fiction tale of the Kim family from 1940 to 1945 during the final years of Korea's occupation by Japan. Told in the fist person and alternating between 10-year-old daughter, Sun-hee, and 13-year-old son, Tae-yul, the tale portrays the rigid roles family members play in traditional Korean culture based on sex and birth order. Park uses the Korean terms of address such as Hynungnim (older brother used by younger brother) and Opah (older brother used by younger sister) throughout the story to help readers feel the \\"rank, respect, and affection\\" in a Korean family.     A major theme in When My Name Was Keoko is identity. What makes a person who they are? The characters delve into what makes them Korean. Like many imperial powers, the Japanese tried to wipe out the Korean culture without offering the people equality in return. In school, the children heard only of the perfect Emperor and superior Japan. The Japanese passed laws that repeatedly and cumulatively took away parts of the Korean people's identity. The Japanese controlled the education system and taught classes in that language. People were forbidden to speak Korean outside the home. The Japanese forced Koreans to register themselves with new Japanese names. The laws that the Japanese imposed on the Korean people and the taxes extracted grew steadily harsher. The Japanese even ordered the people to destroy all Rose of Sharon trees because it is a symbol of Korea; instead, they forced Koreans to plant cherry trees, a symbol of Japan.    When My Name Was Keoko is a well-crafted book that should keep readers turning the pages to find out whathappens to Sun-hee and Tae-yul. Letters and diary entries are also used effectively to add realism to the story, which deals with ordinary children living in a terrifying and difficult time. At the end of the war, Korea became an independent nation again and Sun-hee was no longer known as Keoko. While there are many stories for American young adults about World War II, few of them take place in Asia. Even less discuss the Japanese occupation of Korea or other Asian countries like China and Taiwan. The spirit of the Koreans was not broken and they are still a proud people today.

Wonder is a marvelous land of believing where even the adults are wizards and mages. Like Joseph Campbell's hero, Emma is on a mythic adventure. Her quest wins her knowledge, friends, and a gift of epic proportions.         A school assignment on world discoverers expands Emma's universe. She plunders the library, gathers knowledge and soon she becomes Emma the Red, Viking explorer. Yo, Vikings! is a celebration of story telling both oral and written. Emma hears stories from Mr. Sigurd, the children's librarian, and he directs her to the old tales of Norse history and mythology. She reads stacks of books, then takes notes and draws pictures illustrating what she is learning. She then enthralls her younger brother with stories of dragons, Viking longships , and sword fights.         Judith Byron Schachner's tale introduces some major heroes and gods of Norse history and mythology. For her school report, Emma learns about Erik the Red's journey to Greenland and about his son, Leif Eriksson. Emma is proud to report that Leif came to North America 500 years before Christopher Columbus. In story time, Mr. Sigurd, Emma's helper figure, tells the children of Sigurd, the strong and courageous Norse warrior, and his heroic fight against the dragon Fafnir. Mr. Sigurd does not mention the name of the hero. By looking carefully at Mr. Sigurd's book in the illustration, the reader will see that the dragon slaying hero's name is Sigurd. In her journal, Emma shows Sigurd holding a shield that says \\"librarian\\" as he fights the dragon Fafnir. The god Odin is introduced as a giver of gifts and riding his eight legged horse, though no mention is made of his grimmer, darker qualities.         Yo, Vikings! explores the childhood experiences of awe and wonder and is appropriate for ages about five to ten. The reader is invited to come along on an adventure with a young, female hero. Emma might hearten children, especially young girls, to learn and read for the joy of the adventure, just when girls need the encouragement. Interestingly, Judith Byron Schachner's fantastic story is a retelling of a family story; her daughter Emma actually did have a Viking ship in the back yard for a number of years. The truth in this story may lead other girls and boys to try new things, to learn for fun, and to believe in their dreams. Yo, Vikings! will inspire readers to do some exploring of Viking lore of their own at the library.  Karen Woodworth Roman	2004-04-10

US	23360882	RP5P4WWUJHGPA	1577685652	775988904	Meat-Eating Plants (Eye View)	Books	5	1	1	N	N	High interest book on meat eating plants	High interest topics are covered in the Eye View series and this one is no exception. The meat-eating plants covered are the pitcher plant, venus's flytrap, cobra lily, sun pitcher, albany pitcher, monkey cup, sundew, butterwort, and bladderwort. Did you know that monkeys have actually been seen using the monkey cup plant as a cup? The photographs are excellent, but it is a little disconcerting to see the book's cartoon child guide inside the traps of the meat eating plants.

The book is colorful and has an easy to follow layout. I especially liked the photographs of such things as taste buds and what the walls of your small intestines look like under a microscope. Includes a simple matching activity and suggests additional recourses. Has a glossary and an index. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review	2004-04-07

What it lacks in depth on some subject is makes up for in variety of topics cover. The \\"Inside the Plant\\" section is detailed including diagrams of leaf cells and a discussion of stoma, xylem, and phloem. The only negative comment I could make is that the explanation of photosynthesis is not very detailed **compared to** other topics. I was impressed with the inclusion of the comment in the beginning of the book that warns young botanist not to collect wild plans even if there are lots of them.
