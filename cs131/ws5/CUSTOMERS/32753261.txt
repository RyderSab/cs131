It was so wonderful to watch while Jane slowly crumbled away the wall around Tresh's heart!  What a beautiful story.  And when he wept on her I was almost weeping as well.  Any woman who can bring a big, manly giant like him down is a good woman indeed!!  The only thing that really irked me was his name.  Jocelyn..for a man?  It was just sooo effeminate for a man whos father hated all things effeminate in his sons.  Any time I saw his name, in my mind, I changed it to Tresh!!  LOL  But other than that, this book is wonderful, absolutely spellbinding!  i couldnt put it down!	2004-05-14

She has a way of making the Highlands come to life for me!  This book was no exception.  I loved Cormac and Elspeth!  Cormac was such a strong man, yet not quite the Alpha male that I have come to get used to in HH's books.  Their romance and love is so sweet that when she went back to Donncoil I wanted to literally cry!  I loved the addition of the Armstrong men and Christopher and his nurse.  I hope that this means that HH will be writing books about the Armstrongs next!!!!	2004-05-12

Johanna Lindsey pulls out all the stops with the story of Jeremy, James Malory's(Gentle Rogue), rogue son.  Jeremy is such a great addition to this line of men.  Such an Alpha male!!  He is so protective of Danny and it is so funny to watch him get jealous and go through all the emotions that all men in love go through even though he didnt want to admit it!!!  It was so wonderful in the end with Danny finding out who she really is!  This book is so good, as soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again!!!!

Liam was so funny I was laughing out loud, and yet he was so sweet and caring.  It was so wonderful watching his relationship with Ellen's daughter grow.  And he and Ellen had such a wonderful relationship....until she betrayed him.  But, as a mother I can understand her desperation, so didnt feel to harshly about her in the end.  I literally almost cried when she left the way she did and he was asking her how she could do that to him and his family.

Let me just begin by saying that I cannot believe the negative feedback that this book is getting!!!  This story is wonderful and heartwarming and, if anything, all the secondary characters add so much to the story, bring the storyline to life, and make Stryder's childhood that much more real to the reader!  I loved how Rowena kind of fell in with them and became one of them!!  This is an extraordinary group of men.  The Brotherhood is going to be a new keeper series for me, I can just feel it!!!  I am currently awaiting Lochlan's story in the Macallister series very patiently!  But, getting back to A Dark Champion!  If you love an Alpha male than you are going to LOVE Stryder, I know I did!  And the way he loves Rowena is just heartwarming, considering all that he has gone through.  His relationship with the Brotherhood is very touching, to the point that I wanted to cry for Stryder and the rest of his men.  His men do bring humor to these books.  Val and Swan were particularly funny and had me laughing out loud!  Rowena and the goose feathers was just hilarious!  I am a fan of all of Mrs. Macgregor's work and will continue to grab her books as soon as they hit the shelves.	2004-05-05

Jennifer and Royce were so perfect for each other and there love grew and evolved and I found myself dreaming of my own kingdom of dreams.

I usually never leave a book unread, but, I stopped reading this book 3/4 of the way through and never picked it back up!  This is the first Allison Lane book that I have ever read and I probably wont read anymore of hers.  The book looked so exciting and the first two or three chapters are really interesting.  But, after that I sooo wanted to slap Helen.  She is the most mistrustful, ignorant person I have ever read about.  She finds fault with EVERYTHING that Rafe says or does and treats him like hes a moron for most of the book.  Well, the parts that I read.  Not to mention that in the first 100 pages of the book, she must have thought about or compared Rafe to her ex boyfriend from FOUR years earlier like a gazillion times, and she hasnt heard from or seen him since he snuck out a window at a friend's party FOUR years ago.  And then all of the sudden he is there, wanting her back.  Give me a BREAK!!!  And Rafe, well, I just felt sorry for Rafe.  If I had to deal with the incessant nagging that he did throughout the whole book, I would have gone crazy!  I think I did just from reading parts of this book!!!  Not to mention that he is a wimp of sorts.  He has all these problems with his masculinity and feels INFERIOR to Helen because she is richer than him and most of the time he is trying to think of ways to bring her to heel.  UGGGGHHH...the frustration!!!!  Do NOT read this book!!!!  I am sorry for all of you Allison Lane fans, but, this book is just awful!!	2004-03-21

Ash was for sure a passionate man and Lord, I just fell in love with his character!  I found myself wondering throughout the book how CB had managed to make him so passionate and loving, yet so tough and strong.  I felt like I was there, going through it all with Rhiannon and Ash.

I have just over the past year or so picked up Teresa Medeiros books, but, after this one, she is my new favorite!  It was so funny at parts and at other times it was so heart wrenching!  She certainly has a way with words.  I truly hope that Carey gets his own book soon!  He was such an excellent secondary character!  I love Austyn!  While a bit suspicious, he is such a great hero!  Alot of people were so bent about the whole him locking Holly in the tower thing.  This sort of thing more than likely did happen back in the day as Welsh people are known to be superstitious.  It just didnt bother me all that much.  Anyhow, this book is just so great!!!  Holly was a great heroine!  I loved how she wasnt afraid of Austyn one bit!  I felt so many emotions reading this book, and that is what I look for!  The whole first half of the book I was laughing out loud!!!  To anyone who is thinking about a good book, this is one of the best that I have read in a long time!	2004-02-11

I picked it up and did not put it down until it was finished!!!  JL has been a long time favorite of mine and I love all of her books.  I gave this book four stars because I thought that overall there were just so many petty misunderstandings, that they took away from the storyline a little.  Other than that, I loooved Rolfe.  What a great hero!  He was a terribly honorable man and I love that in a hero!  I liked Leonie too, except that she was the one who instigated most of the misunderstandings.  In spite of that, this was a wonderful book and I truly enjoyed it from start to finish.	2004-01-30

James is so ..what word can I use?  &quot;Va Va Voom&quot; comes to mind!  Well, that is three words, but, who is counting?!  He is so gentle and loving towards Riona. He even kept a journal of his feelings!  What a completely wonderful hero. Riona and he were so tortured by their feelings. I felt as though I was there going through it and the end made me just smile a huge smile!  It made me sigh one of those long, heartfelt sighs.

It is absolutely wonderful!  I just LOVED Alisdair and Isabeal.  I really like Karen Ranney's style of writing.  The heros arent too harsh, the females are strong and the love scenes arent nauseatingly explicit.  All in all, that makes for an excellent book!  Alisdair is so wonderful and I loved how Isabeal loved him so much!  I also like how Patricia was factored in.  A nice way to add to the story.  This book was wonderful, this whole series is!

I read reviews here on Amazon about Karen Ranney and decided to giver her Scottish Lord's series a try.  So, I bought all four of them and couldnt wait to start them.  I was not dissappointed!  One Man's Love is a beautiful story.  The ending, while bittersweet, couldnt have ended any other way than it did, and it brought tears to my eyes.  Ian and Lietus are a beautiful couple and shared such an intimate history that more than once it made my eyes misty.  I felt for Lietus, when she didnt understand her attraction to The Butcher and her love for Ian.  To feel that way for two men has to be a disconcerting feeling, to say the least.   Mrs. Ranney made me feel like I was a part of the book and like I was there going through it all with the Scots.  The loss of Lietus's family and Ian's mother made me remember that at a time in history things like that actually did happen to the Scots.  This book showed a great respect for the history of the Scottish people, while telling a beautiful romance.  A great read and another to add to my never ending pile of favorites.  Now on to book two of the Scottish Lord's series!	2003-12-08

The relationship that grows between Ewan and Nora is beautiful and I am so glad that she is a strong heroine.  I get so tired of some of the other authors that I read writing about spoiled, ridiculous heroines.  This book was refreshing and yet it stayed right in with the theme of the MacAllister series. I really hope that the next book is one about Kieran because I am dying to know what ever happened to him!!!  Kinley Macgregor is my new favorite author and I cannot believe that she felt the need to defend her credibility because some people are so disrespectful about someone elses work.

As a child who grew up thinking Elvis was the best thing in pants, this movie made me feel very disappointed.  I felt as though Priscilla exploited Elvis and made him look terrible.  I am in no way disputing what went on in their household as noone knows that better than Priscilla, and yet I couldnt help feeling like she didnt need to make him look like such a monster, while she came away looking like the virgin Mary.  Noone can say what her marriage was truly like, except herself and yet I find myself a little resentful that she basically blamed her infidelity on Elvis as if that made it all ok.  Dont get me wrong, I watch this movie every time it is on tv, but, I watch it because I love Elvis, not truly because I want to feel sorry for a woman who has made millions off of a dead man who to this day is still putting out albums although he has been dead for 26 years.  I will watch this movie over and over again if for nothing else than it is about Elvis and I love to learn more and more about him, but, I dont think that Priscilla was truly the complete victim that she made herself out to be, especially after reading the kind of person she was after she left Elvis.  Why doesnt she write a book about that?	2003-08-22

I have read a million books, but, this book is by far the best that I have ever read!  I bought this book for A REALLY GOOD PRICE and boy, what a steal!!  This book is worth ten times what I paid for it!!  Axton and Linnea were one of the most powerful couples that I have ever read about.  I felt like I was there going through it all with them and I wanted to slap Linnea's grandmother(even though she got around to it eventually).  Her family is so horrible.  I cannot tell you how great of a book this is.  You have to read it for yourself.  I fell in love with Axton myself!  And this is NOT one of those books where there are a thousand little misunderstandings that drive you crazy and have you beating your head against the wall by the end.  It is a very well thought out book, set in a wonderfully romantic time, with two of the strongest lead characters that I have ever read about!!  I have never read Rexanne Becnel before, but, I am buying all of her books and this one is going on my favorites pile to be read forty more times!!	2003-07-23

Colt and Jocelyn are beautiful together.  I love to watch him overcome all of his insecurities and let her love him.  The part where he leaves her at his dad's ranch brought tears to my eyes!!  And then there is the &quot;interesting&quot; incident that happened on top of a horse.  Absolutley the hottest love scene that I have ever read!!  Read this book!  You will not be sorry!!	2003-07-23

I am an absolute lover of all of JL's books, except one which is not worth a mention, but, this book is one of my all time favorites!!!  I loved Cassie and Angel and the way that they ended up getting married is hilarious!!!!  This book is one to read and reread over and over again.  Angel- well, one word describes him: hubba hubba.  Ok, so it is kinda two words!!!!  Read this book!  You will love it and read it a gazillion times!!!	2003-07-23

Unfortuantely, I had read Gentle Rogue and Tender Rebel before reading this so I already knew what happened!  But, there is nothing like reading it first hand!!  This is another great creation by JL.	2003-07-23
US	32753261	R3MVWM7LJ8PEEX	0060518642	641921275	Prisoner of My Desire	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Loved this book!!	While I agree with one of the other reviewers who states that the \\"rape\\" at the beginning of the book is a little much to take, the book does have many redeeming qualities.  The way that Warrick gets revenge over Rowena is exactly what one would expect him to do after being so humiliated and abused by her and her brother.  But, after getting past that, the book is wonderful.  Warrick and Rowena do surprisingly have great chemistry and make the story wonderful.  I felt so horrible for all of the things that Warrick and Rowena had suffered throughout their lives and was happy that they could eventually make each other happy.  All in all, I gave this book four stars due to how uncomfortble the beginning made me feel, but, after that point the book was wonderful!	2003-07-23

Not my favorite and not typical Johanna Lindsey, but good.  Chad was incredible!!!!  What a man!!!!  And I really liked Marian's character, although I wish that she had had more guts where Amanda was concerned.  I would have given her a run for her money!!!!!  All in all, a really good book, that is worth the read!!!  I would say to anyone who is interested to give it a try!!!	2003-07-18

I HOPE THAT SHANNON DRAKE CONTINUES WITH THIS FAMILY.  THE MEN ARE WONDERFUL.  BIG, MUSCULAR, MANLY MEN WHO ARE CAPABLE OF LOVE.  SOMETHING EVERY WOMAN WANTS.  THE HEROINES TEND TO BE A BIT SELFISH AND AT TIMES FRUSTRATING, BUT, THAT DOES NOT KEEP THIS FROM BEING ONE OF THE BEST SHANNON DRAKE BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ.  WELL, ALL OF HER BOOKS ARE GREAT, BUT, THE GRAHAM SAGA IS EXCEPTIONAL.  FOR ANOTHER GOOD GRAHAM NOVEL, TRY ERIC'S STORY THE KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT.	2003-07-02

Shannon Drake does it again with this extraordinary book!  I absolutely loved this book.  I felt so heartsick for Igrainia ans Eric, both at opposite ends of a terrible war and such heartache to overcome!  I almost came close to tears when Igrainia was in the crypts, trying to explain her feelings to Afton.  What a heartbreaking chapter!  It was almost like I was there, that is how very well the book is portrayed.  This is a keeper, and I will probably read it a thousand times!  Now.......on to Jamie's story, The Lion in Glory!!	2003-06-30

This series is turning out to be another wonderful one for me!  I cant wait to continue to read about all of the Mcallisters.  The whole family has a great story, filled with everything that we love.  Braden and Maggie were beautiful together.  I loved how they knew each other so well.  The memories that they had of each other over the years warmed my heart, and the love that Braden felt for Maggie was heartwrenching at times, and funny at others.  I especially liked the part that Braden's brother, Sin, played in being a matchmaker of sorts.  This book had me laughing and crying all at the same time!  I am going to buy all of Kinley Macgregor's books that I can get my hands on!!!	2003-06-18

I am only halfway through and I cannot put it down!!  I cant wait to read the rest....and to think that I have waited almost a month to read this due to the reviews it got!!  Although it is not what some might enjoy and includes alot of flowery phrases, it is typical Woodiwiss and I love it so far!	2003-06-06

Rowena and Gareth were the best couple that I have read about in a long time!!  I just wish that the end had explained how long the \\"many, long months\\" were that Gareth had been gone and that there was a better explanation as to what he went through while away.  I also wish there had been an explanation as to what had happened to Rowena after Gareth left, or Marlys.  But, all in all this book was great.  The sparks flew any time that Rowena and Gareth were in the same room.  Not to mention his sheer strength!!  I will probably reread this book over and over again!!!	2003-05-23

I started reading Julie Garwood at the suggestion of an aunt, and boy am I glad that I did.  She never dissapoints!!  Every time I buy one of her books, I read it immediately because i know it is going to be awesome.  Ransom kept me intrigued from start to finish...I dont remember Brodick being so aggresive in The Secret, but, then again, I havent read it in a few years!!  Time to get it out and refresh my memory.  I loved getting the update on Judith and Ian, and their little boy was adorable!!  Brodick was such a good hero for Gillian.  And Gillian's character had me laughing out loud!!  She is not afraid of anyone.  I was also thoroughly pleased with Ramsey and Bridgid.  What a great couple.  This one will go on my never ending pile of favorites, to be read again a thousand times!!	2003-05-16

I love Johanna Lindsey and own almost all of her novels, but this one is beyond stupid...I could not get into it.  It took me five days to finish it and I usually read a book in a day.  I only finished it because I dont like leaving a book unread.  The characters are so ridiculous, they never develope, and I hate Larissa.  She is so naive and stupid, and who in their right minds would just let a man(and practically a stranger at that) into her bed after only a few weeks, especially after he kicked her out of her house!!  I wait longer than that for some of my boyfriends and I generally like them!  There was no plot, no developement of a relationship, it was terrible.  I would say to anyone who is interested try Johanna's Malory series or Savage Thunder, or Captive Bride.  Those are true Lindsey works, not this garbage.	2003-05-12

I loved watching the transformation in Johanna and her love for Gabriel and his clan.  Gabriel was another wonderful example of what every woman wants, a champion.  Someone to care first and foremost about US!!  The story here is so good, I couldn't put it down....I wish it would have went on and on.  There is not one second in the book that is boring.  I felt so bad for Johanna and what she had gone through because of her awful first husband.  But, through Gabriel's patience and love she learned to believe in herself and him!!  The other characters in the book were so funny and interesting!!  I was laughing out loud over Keith and Lindsay and their constant questions and assumptions!!  I believe that Ms. Garwood should give Collum and Leila their own story as well as Nicholas and Clare..I would snatch them up in a heartbeat!!  this story is a keeper..you will not waste your time with this book!!!	2003-05-09

I had bought this book along with The King's Pleasure and was so disgusted with that book that I had to make myself pick up Ondine.  But, am I glad that I did!!  Now, this is the Shannon Drake that I am used to.  What a beautiful love story!  The love scenes were even touching.  It left me wishing that the story would go on and on, but, then again maybe it is good that it ended when it did.  I read the whole thing at work!!  I couldn't help it, I couldn't put it down!!	2003-05-07

I had to make myself finish it, and I am a person that loves to read and hates to leave a book unread.  I absolutley loved Adrien!  He was every woman's dream.  Strong, loyal, loving when he needs to be, and capable of emotions, not to mention gorgeous.  I hated Danielle! What a whiner and a treasonous sneak.  What a thanks Edward gets for giving the ungrateful brat a place to live when she has nowhere else to go.  She made me so mad I wanted to throw the book across the room, or in the trash.  Enough about Arville already.  That's all she talked about.  My goodness, and to hold a grudge against Adrien for something that he did when he was ten years old and she wasnt even thought of yet, not to mention something she knew nothing about was just ridiculous.  Also, the \\"relationship\\" that she had with Philip was ludicrous.  To be that loyal to a man that you have only met once, just because he gives you a friggin horse is totally unbelievable!   I loved the love that Adrien had for Danielle.  I just wish that Mrs. Drake could have given him a better heroine.  The one she gave him was unbearable!	2003-05-05

I loved this book.  I can't believe everyone didn't!!  I will admit that the beginning is kind of rushed, but, after the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down.  I read it in one evening!!

This book is by far one of my alltime favorites!!  Faith is just as successful as Grey, and very determined!  My heart wept for her at the humiliation and hurt she faced as a child, but, she overcame it.  What a way to show a person!  Now, who wants who!!  I have unfortunately lost my copy, so I will have to buy another one, because after reading all of the reviews, I want to read it again!!	2003-05-02

I have read every Kathleen novel I can get my hands on and love her characters.  Shemaine and Gage had awesome chemistry, and I loved their interaction with Andy.  For the person who said that Shemaine was convictted of murder, did you not read the book?  She was convicted of theivery!!!  And for the person who found Gage an irresponsible parent, since when is it irresponsible to hire someone to watch your kid while you work.  Lets get a grip!!  All in all, I would read this again in a heartbeat.  It is a keeper.	2003-04-30

Sin's torment was absolutley heartbreaking, and yet Callie loved him anyway.  The bond between him and his brothers brought tears to my eyes!

I just finished Come the Spring, and as always, Garwood kept me intrigued from start to finish.  I never want to put her books down and find myself sneaking at work to catch a quick chapter at my desk!!  Come the Spring had excellent twists and I loved the chemistry between Cole and Jessica/Grace and Daniel.  The scenes with Cole and Caleb were especially endearing to me, being a single mother.  Garwood appeals to the romantic in me every time!  This was no exception.  This is a must read, especially if you have read the four other Calyborne novels.  It brings everything full circle!	2003-03-07

I could not put it down.  I love the story of Shawn and Brenna!  There is something so quaint about them.  They have been friends forever, and there friends and family are all the same.  Add to that a little, quiet seaside village in Ireland and you have an excellent book!!  I have always wanted to travel to Ireland and after reading this book, I know that one day I will!	2003-03-05

The chemistry between James and Georgina is<BR>wonderful! James is the man that all of us romantics at heart dream of marrying and Georgina is like every woman on one level or another.  Of course, the book wouldn't have been the same without Johanna Lindsey's excellent sense of humor.  Some parts of the book had me laughing out loud!  I have read this book three times and will read it probably three more times.  I bought all of the books in the Malory series after reading Gentle Rogue!	2003-03-05

I normally don't read mystery novels, but, I have read alot of Nora's, and nobody does them like her.  I love the way her characters become a part of you.  It's like you are there with them at cetain points in the book.  I truly felt for Noah as he tried to climb over Olivia's 1000 foot wall, and I felt her pain and terror as a child and then again as an adult.  The ending was such a surprise to me, I held my mouth open for at least a full five minutes!  One of Nora's best, definitley!!	2003-03-05

This was one of the first books that I bought that began my book collection years ago, and I have been hooked on Kathleen Woodiwiss ever since!  I love all of the Birmingham stories and have bought them all and read them over and over.  The Birmingham men are hilarious and as different as day and night!  That's what makes them so great to read.  Brandon, while a little pushy(let's face it, what man isnt!), truly loves Heather and takes care of her.  He brings her to a whole new life and gives her a family.  My favorite part of the book is when Brandon defends Heather against her aunt.  Gotta love a nice, strong man!!	2003-03-05
