This book is an invitation to experience simple rituals in your daily life. I especialy enjoyed the beautiful art work and many pictures. This book takes the reader on a gilded journey through the entire year with wonderfull passages describing a myriad of traditions and daily rituals for living. If you cherish the victorian tradition then you simply must have this book. Buy it new or used, read it, experience it, and pen a review to spread the joy, this truly is home.	2004-09-22

To begin with it's not really about VooDoo but Santeria which is different from VooDoo in many many ways. These authros are very negative when speaking about pretty much anyone other than themselves and while I do agree with their views concerning some things most of it is pretty silly. The authors also make a lot of claims about prostitutes using VooDoo to demand more cash from their clients. The authors are certainly mysogynistic in many of their views. I gave this book 2 stars only because I enjoyed the many pictures they included of botanicas in New york. If you are looking for books which are truly in the VooDoo spirit then read MAMA LOLA, JAMBALAYA by Luisha Teish, and SECRETS OF VOODOO by Milo Rigaud.  <br />Incidently, the authors claim to have used many methods not even associated with voodoo in their supposed \\"voodoo\\" practices which is the readers first clue that this book is questionable. In closing I will relate the authors claim that this book was written for the Bokor, the sorcerer, not the Houngan or village priest. It was intended to be used more on an individual basis and the initiation ritual presented, if you can call it that is some sort of ceremonial magic prayer which also has nothing to do with VooDoo. If you are going to spend the cash on this one then get it used.	2004-09-20

Nothing but wiccan fluff perpetrated by Llewyllyn to make cash. I rate this book the same as HooDoo mysteries by Malbrough who wrote an equally false book. If you are thinking of getting this one then think again, its not Brujeria, Voodoo, Santeria, or anything at all other than wicca using the name of Guadalupe as if she were just another architype of some wiccan goddess.	2004-09-20

Mama Lola is a story of a beautiful, powerfull, witty, charming, and loveable priestess who came from Haiti to live in New York. The story starts with her ancestor Josef Binbin Mauvaunt and works its way through her family line to her and her children all the while intermingling stories of lif in Brooklyn. The author is a student and close friend of Mama Lola's and tells the story from her perspective after hearing the stories from Mama Lola. The author also relates many first hand accounts from trips on which she accompanied Mama Lola as well as rituals she attended including her own initiation in Haiti. If you want to know about some of the VooDoo traditions or perhaps just looking for a great story then you have found it!	2004-09-20

I had this book for my first college course in Business law and without it I might have failed. The book utalizes real cases and situations to explain virtualy every topic. The text is presented in a very clear and concise manner and applies to Business Law as practiced in America today. I personally have even used the information in this book to argue a case of my own in small claims and won. Im sure the other reviewer of this book just didn't take the time to study and learn the information. Rely on experience, not ramblings, buy this book!	2004-09-13

The problem is in the writing style of the text, it truly will make you fall asleep. There are alsop a lack of useable diagrams when it come to writing law office memos. The formats however are presented rather well and I would reccomend this text to a paralegal to use as a reference but look into other materials which help aswell such as QUICK STUDY LAW LEGAL WRITING BAR CHART.	2004-09-08

There is a big difference between wiccan and witch and this book is all wicca. Wicca was created by gardner and is full of ceremony, circle work and initiations. If you are looking for books on witchcraft then go to HEALING WISE by Susun Weed, HERBAL RITUALS by Judith Berger, and LOVE IS IN THE EARTH by Melody, all of these books touch on natural non ceremonial witchcraft as daily life, not religion.	2004-09-08
