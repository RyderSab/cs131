Books	5	3	3	N	N	Solid look at one of the greatest tactical leaders of WWII	Richard Lamb's `Montgomery in Europe 1943-1945: Success or Failure' is a solid piece of historical literature that lacks the bias oft observed in works dealing with a figure such as Monty.  Lamb is neither unfairly soft nor hard on Montgomery; he in fact presents a human portrait of the British Field Marshal that evokes a number of emotions from the reader toward this larger than life subject of military history, ranging from admiration and awe to empathy and understanding to disappointment and irritation.  One of the strongest points to come through in Lamb's work is that Monty was a man of consistency.  Montgomery's strong sense of purpose, confidence in self and those he led and desire to defeat the enemy on his terms with the lowest sacrifice of his men, produced in him the ability to instill both deep loyalty from subordinates who felt he was watching out for them, as well as distain from superiors who often felt him too cautious and slow.  On reading \\"Montgomery in Europe' one gets a clear picture that Monty's pros and cons were inevitable sides of the same coin - we couldn't have one without the other.  A similar picture of the man comes out in `Operation Victory', the wartime memoirs of Monty's former Chief of Staff, F. De Guigand.<br /><br />`Montgomery in Europe' is a well-written book that is accessible to readers from varied backgrounds and interest levels.  Lamb's style is not esoteric in the least and it takes very little time for the reader to establish a good rhythm.  The chapters are nicely parsed out and logical text breaks used where necessary.  Lamb is a serious historian as illustrated by his thorough research of the subject matter, citation of published and unpublished works (both primary and secondary), and his unbiased presentation of his findings.  As mentioned earlier Lamb presents himself as neither a Monty-phile nor Monty-phobe, his approach is even handed.  This is not to suggest that Lamb gives no opinions based on his research, he does, but they are clearly presented and argued with clarity provided by the solid research he has done.  Not all will agree with all of Lamb's conclusions but it is hard to argue that he has come to them unfairly or in an unsound manner.  Lots to learn here.<br /><br />In the end Lamb's book is a solid 4.5 star book worthy of a read, especially for those interested in Monty and his interactions with other figures and his historical place in the annals of the Allied defeat of Germany.es, but they are clearly presented and argued with clarity provided by the solid research he has done.

Walter Bedell Smith is a compact and insightful look at the defeat of Nazi Germany from the perspective of a SHAEF insider.  This book is a fine contribution to the European Theater of Operations literature and should be read by all who have a serious interest in this portion of the Second World War.<br /><br />Smith presents the following as Ike's \\"Six Great Decisions\\":<br /><br />1) The decision to go ahead with OVERLORD (invasion of the European Continent) on 6 June 1944.  What made this a great decision is obvious!<br /><br />2) The decsion to go ahead with Gen. Omar Bradley's plan to trap German Seventh Army in Falaise pocket.  While this venture failed to achieve all it could have (many would say should have) it was a bold decision made at a critical time.<br /><br />3) The decision to strengthen the flanks of the German Ardennes penetration (US 10th Armored from south & US 7th Armored from N) and to bring reserve forces (US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divs) up to the front - the first towards St. Vith and latter heading towards Bastogne (before the Germans were close to these Belgian towns).  What made this a great decision in Smith's mind was the timing: it all this occurred before it was clear that the German attack was a major counteroffensive.<br /><br />4) The decision to engage in a broad front engagement of the enemy between the West Wall (Siegfried Line) and the Rhine.  By this Smith is referring to the use successive coordinated attacks from Holland in the north to the Vosges region in the south, and then to cross the Rhine in force in the north into the Ruhr, followed by crossing in the south into the Frankfurt corridor.  Smith makes it clear that this was a great decision since its prosecution led to the successful defeat of Germany and that it was strategically the plan from the start (although tactical employment varied some from initial conception).<br /><br />5) The decision to pursue a broad front plan for the double envelopment of the Ruhr once a bridgehead over the Rhine was established.  Smith states that, \\"the plan fixed, in a general way, the principle lines of communication - roads, railroads, and waterways - to which we gave priority in development and repair. It influenced the assignment of troops to the various Allied army groups and armies, and dictated the sequence of intermediate objectives all the way from Normandy to the Elbe.\\"  This portion of the combat on the western front sealed the fate of the German army in the west.<br /><br />6) The decision to forego Berlin as the ultimate target of the Western Allies and to instead destroy remaining troops in Germany by massive all out attacks from the Baltic to the Alps; in other words to force Germany's unconditional surrender militarily!<br /><br />So what makes Smith's 1958 treatise worth tracking down when so many other recollections from other high level insiders have been produced and are certainly more easily obtained?  First, while many of the books by other Allied generals are self-serving memoirs (Montgomery's Memoirs and Eisenhower's Great Crusade, as two obvious examples), Smith's book does very little by way of building up Smith's role or defending any mistakes Smith might have made - in fact it is rare that Smith refers to himself at all, and when he does it is contextual to the actions of others which overshadow his role.  Instead, Eisenhower's Six Great Decisions is dedicated to how specific decisions of the Supreme Commander and their execution by the Allied troops in the field led to defeat of the German war machine.  Second, and related to the aforementioned attribute, is the truly Allied perspective Smith gives to events.  Again unlike many books written from the top of the man-power pile, Smith generally leaves behind any nationalistic views he may have held and gives all the Allied partners appropriate credit for their contributions, neither building-up American nor tearing-down British and Commonwealth achievements.  This is a rare event in literature written from Smith's level.  Unlike many Allied generals, Smith is generally referred to in a positive light by soldiers and historians alike, independent of what side of the nationalistic fence those men/women fell.  Thus lends credibility to Smith's \\"Allied-perspective\\" statements.  However, the achieved fairness is not without cost since Smith's Allied-friendliness sacrifices criticism that can be fairly leveled.  Third and lastly, Smith casts the \\"six decisions\\" within a larger context of the ETO, both relative to combat and politics (or perceptions thereof), thus providing the reader with a broad-perspective view of the events put in motion by Eisenhower's decisions.  One can get a good general picture of events that transpired from D-day to VE-day by reading Smith's book.  All this in less than 300 pages (229 pages of text to be precise).<br /><br />Unfortunately Smith's book is not easy to get a hold of which means too few students of WWII history are likely to read it.  Having said this it is well worth the effort to find a copy - check out you local public library, college library or order it via an Interlibrary Loan.

US	44851296	R1CRAECY6QIKJG	0865530696	356167214	The War Between the Generals	Books	3	17	27	N	N	Balanced picture of Allied command in the ETO	David Irving's \\"The War Between The Generals\\" is an insightful piece of military history.  Irving's study follows the personalities and actions of most of the major Allied military leaders of the European Theater of Operations (ETO) - including both combat and COMZ generals - from the planning stages of Operation OVERLORD through the end of the war and occupation period.  Beyond the generals Irving also mixes in their interactions with political leaders from Secretaries of War to the Big Three.  In the end one can get a good feel for the Allied command structure and operation in the ETO and how personalities and nationalism affected the relationship between the partners and the function of their armies.  By including \\"partners\\" more often ignored (like the de Gaull, the difficult leader of the Free French) by other author-historians, Irving has provided the widest context for reader comprehension of the events described.  Certainly this broad approach has prevented the reader from being cheated of important issues and personalities!<br /><br />At just under 420 pages, \\"The War Between The Generals\\" covers a lot of ground.  The book is broken up roughly chronologically, with the exception of the introductory chapter that is set in the immediate post-war period.  While the contents of this first chapter entitled, \\"Cover Plan\\", suggest that the reader is going to be treated to some type of noir thriller this is seriously misleading.  The introductory chapter sits alone and out of place.  The stage set by the introductory chapter is never played upon nor is it ever visited again - this reviewer was left somewhat confused by this first chapter, other than to get readers engaged initially.  Unfortunately the author never fulfills the literary expectations set forth in this introduction.  Fortunately, Irving's research is solid and his prose tight such that this reader was not ultimately disappointed.  There is plenty of material for consumption here.  While Irving has clearly done a good deal of research to put this book together he doesn't make clear citations to particular pieces of work nor does he utilize any bibliography aside from archival source information.  Given that this book was written in 1981 and is quite good in its depth and context within the larger ETO literature it is difficult to understand how Irving crafted such a piece of work in a vacuum from others works.  Coming from an academic background this reviewer is certainly not going to criticize someone for using primary sources (Irving is a serious researcher in this regard) but one should also give credence to secondary sources that have been influential.<br /><br />In the end there is a dearth of information in \\"The War Between The Generals\\" and Irving has done a quick good job capturing the attention of the reader.  Yet, the seemingly misplaced introductory chapter and lack of reference to any previously published work distracts from the overall solid-ness of this work.  Certainly a worthwhile read for the serious student of WWII and for those particularly interested in the personalities who formed the coalition that defeated the Nazi's and returned western Europe to freedom.  If you're looking for light reading or a great yarn that's hard to put down \\"The War Between The Generals\\" may not be your cup of tea.  3.5 total stars.<br /><br />P.S. Fortunately this reviewer read \\"The War Between The Generals\\" before he knew of the controversy that surrounds Mr. Irving.  In short Irving is a Holocaust-revisionist/denialist, believing that the atrocities of the Third Reich are more propaganda than reality.  This view has cast serious doubt of credibility on Mr. Irving's work from the academic community.  Having said that serious historians have lauded some of Irving's works are quite important and novel so despite his nutty delusions about the Holocaust, Irving has shown himself to be capable of decent work.  \\"The War Between The Generals\\" is certainly in this last category and has not a hint of anti-semitism or Hitler-worship in its pages.  Thus, this reviewer concludes that \\"The War Between The Generals\\" is an honest (with caveats discussed in the review) attempt to present a picture of the Allied command structure and personalities operating in the ETO from summer 1944 through the end of the Second World War.last category and has not a hint of anti-semitism or Hitler-worship in its pages.

The subtitle suggested that somehow this aforementioned notion would be offset by the damage incurred to the relationship between parent (Britain) and child (US).  Unfortunately only the first prediction holds up upon reading.<br /><br />Whiting is a prolific writer and Second World War historian, who has made contributions to the field of military history literature that are worthy of study.  The Field Marshal's Revenge is a piece of work that falls between un-worthy and worthy - what? You ask.  Some pieces of historical literature are simply not worth picking up, while others are classics in all respects that all students of military history should read at least once.  The present book fits neither of these categories.  It's not awful, but it's not great either.  I hesitate to even say it's \\"good\\" because that would be potentially too encouraging.  Yet to say it's \\"simply bad\\" would be overstating the negatives.  So what's right and what's wrong with this book?<br /><br />Pros: Whiting is an engaging writer who certainly creates a very readable prose.  Of the stuff of his I've read I'd put him in the second tier of military writers with respect to storytelling (where top tier folks are people like J. Toland, C. Ryan, S. Ambrose, R. Atkinson, and A. Kershaw).  Certainly writing a good story is Whiting's forte.<br /><br />Cons: First, Whiting's research for The Field Marshal's Revenge is quite shabby.  Of the 49 sources Whiting cites in his bibliography, none are primary sources (unless one considers Omar Bradley's autobiographies/memoirs primary sources, in which case there are two) and nine are Whiting's own books!  So don't expect new revelations based on untapped sources.  In fact most of the revelations made in this book are completely without citation or reference to a source.  For example, Whiting makes assertions that Eisenhower's Broad Front strategy post-Normandy Breakout was based in large part on the desire to let all the commanders and their armies in NW Europe (including US Seventh Army coming up from S France) take place in the final assault on Germany.  He further asserts that the pause in Nov/Dec 44 along of the West Wall (Siegfried Line) was done merely to ensure that this, especially the participation of US Armies, took place.  Yet Whiting provides no cited evidence of this being the case.  It is hard to argue that Ike was not concerned with political fallout from unbalanced interactions/actions of the Allies he commanded, yet to trivialize the Broad Front strategy in these terms does more to hurt the case for Montgomery's Narrow Front argument than prove Ike's strategic decision was wrong.  In another example of making claims without clear evidence of truth is Whiting's assertion that Patton essential knew about (or at least seriously suspected) the planned German Ardennes Counteroffensive and planned his northward swing to \\"save\\" the First Army before the German offensive started.  Moreover, Whiting writes that Patton did this without informing SHAEF and it was all for his personal glory!  Yet, what sources of information does Whiting draw upon to develop such theories?  Although he cites nine of his own books it is curious that with respect to this latter example of a \\"con\\", Whiting fails to even cite his own recent work, The Ghost Front, in which he had previously made such assertions (with no more evidence being provided there!).<br /><br />So why does Whiting make such claims?  One can imagine that much of this has its roots in his little hidden Anglo/Monty-philia and Americanphobia.  Many historical writers bias their works in terms of their own geographical connections, especially in the field of military history.  Yet the BEST author-historians maintain anunbiased approach to their research.  It is possible that due to lack of critical and deep research Whiting felt no compunction to heed this rule?  One can only wonder.<br /><br />So in the final analysis, The Field Marshal's Revenge is a 4 star read with a 1 star (graciously given) effort in terms of historical research.  2 stars final grade!aintain an unbiased approach to their research.

Yet it is fair to ask: Is Sun Tzu's work a classic piece of military literature with relevance to or lessons for the student of war in the 21st Century?  If yes then it should, as its title implies, give the modern reader a sense of how approaches war with professionalism and competence as a artist would approach canvas or clay before creating a piece worth of display in one of the world's great museums.  This expectation does not necessarily imply that The Art of War need provide new revelations about warfare and how to win at the endeavor.  If in fact The Art of War can merely illuminate currently accepted \\"principles\\" of war in a fashion that allows simple and direct digestion and assimilation of these \\"principles\\", it has fulfilled this expectation.  In deed it is fair to say that the fifty-eight pages of text Sun Tzu has generated achieves this with clarity and ease.  Readers should be aware that The Art of War reads like 5th Century B.C. Chinese philosophy (a la Confucius) but this is part of the simple charm of The Art of War - how else could one distill warfare into so little space?  If in fact readers are searching for totally new insights into war and warfare, The Art of War will certainly disappoint.  The lessons provided within its prose will in many ways seem obvious, almost too commonplace to be important.  Yet, if the reader reflects on Sun Tzu's words for some period of time he/she will come to appreciate the simplicity and value of the words.  Also, put ones self in the time of Sun Tzu - then the text becomes considerably more amazing!  Some parts of The Art of War are certainly dated by there references to types of weapons or to ancient Chinese conflicts, but in general the \\"principles\\" laid out are time-tested and as true today as their were 2500 years ago.  Not a minor feat for any book of non-fiction.  The Art of War is a one-evening read worth reading - 4.5 stars.<br /><br />(The version reviewed here is an older copy of Lionel Giles' translation)ng - 4.5 stars.

Yet I believe it is important to say a few things, damning as they are:<br /><br />D.J. Haycock's book, Eisenhower and the Art of War, simply drips with loathing for the American Armed forces of the Second World War, from front-line GI all the way to Ike.  Haycock spares no one on the American side.  If one believes Haycock's prose, essentially all American efforts were misplaced (unless directed by Montgomery) or ineffectual without the British.  One should not read into my comments as Anglo-phobia; clearly the British soldiery played a significant role (and for much longer) in the defeat of the Axis powers, but it is patently unfair to paint with broad strokes of contempt for all the American soldier did in WWII.  Somehow Haycock manages to put the Americans at one end of the spectrum and the British at the other (the poor Canadians sit in between and the French aren't even given token respect) - a picture that suggests British dominance in areas of military savoy, soldiering capabilities, and shear ingenousness.  Haycock gives America credit for mass production but little else.  Very few credible historians would argue that Montgomery was one of the best field commanders of the Second World War, and that Ike was not in the same league as a field commander.  Yet, even Montgomery acknowledged that Eisenhower was exactly the right man for the job of Supreme Commander - the man who could and did hold the Allies together to defeat the Axis.  Hitler always believed he could split the American-British (I include here Empire and Commonwealth partners)-Soviet alliance, and alliance of convienance rather than common idiology or common historical bonds.  Yet the Allies stuck it out, for better or worse.  One can not escape the results of the alliance - the Cold War was a direct consequence - yet now that we've made it through that period of history it is fair to say that the defeat of Nazi Germany at the price of the Cold War was a fair, if not on balance positive, trade.  My point is that Eisenhower had his faults as a military leader - field savy he was not - but he managed a difficult team with difficult personalities (included Haycock's favored Monty) to victory, and simple unsupported, or fantastic, attacks on the American soldier with Ike as it's leader does not negate these facts.<br /><br />Save your time and money, Eisenhower and the Art of War is Ameri-phobia at its worse and even worse historical writing.  More than that, Haycock is not a coherent writer and the book is just difficult to read (even if one could get past the clear lack of objectivity - which Haycock claims is missing in all other books one the subject!). To lump Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton together as poor, unimaginative and often destructive (to the Allied battle cause) leaders is ludicrous.  America had it's share of bad leaders (Fredendall as Haycock points out was truly bad) but the British didn't corner the market on great leadership.  Mr. Haycock should also recognize that the Western Front was not the end-all - let's not forget the Allied parner in the East. The Soviets lost more men in the war than anyone else and in all likelihood could have defeated the Germans without their Western allies.  The British played a role certainly, one that can never be allowed to be forgotten, but please don't oversell it - it diminishes their heroic efforts!it through that period of history it is fair to say that the defeat of Nazi Germany at the price of the Cold War was a fair, if not on balance positive, trade.

Andidora's book is a \\"hidden gem\\", one of those books that have somehow slipped by most people's radars - or at least popular literature radars.  One reason for the relative obscurity of Home By Christmas is almost certainly its cost: it's hard to capture a broad readership with a 180 pp. book for ~$90!  It's really too bad that this book hasn't gotten broader readership because it does a really good job covering, a controversial topic that has been discussed in a large number of higher profile books, namely the broad versus narrow front debate that started in the fall of 1944 and continues to this day.<br /><br />Andidora does really nice job setting the debate in context of the war in Northwestern Europe (while also touching on how these events fit with events on the Eastern Front).  He also places the debate firmly within the strategic sphere while not completely losing track of the political and personality influences (although the latter topics receive much less attention).  Anadidora should also be commended for having the guts to not short change one of the biggest factors that plays into almost any strategic decision: the logistical realities that constrain strategy.  Most arguments avoid discussions of logistics as these issues don't sell books typically.  Yet in doing this, these latter books seriously miss represent the issues or give too much credence to other influences.  Andidora manages to cover the logistics issues without boring or confusing the reader - no small task.  Andidora enhances all of his discussions with a set of maps that are generally quite useful if simplistic in presentation.<br /><br />In the final analysis Home By Christmas is a really well crafted book that hits the mark as a historical work that serious students of WWII should pick up and read.

Patrick Murray's PhD dissertation.  Like most dissertations Murray's work is fairly narrow in focus while still representing a scholarly piece of historical literature.  The debate referred to in the Murray's title is centered on the strategic discord that existed in the fall of 1944 between the British and American partners in the United Nations alliance; namely, whether to pursue a narrow single thrust strategy or a broad front strategy.  While multiple factors contributed to this discord Murray attempts to reduce the debate to one centered not on strategy but more on issues of command.  Murray does not discount logistics or political realities in sculpting the strategic decision, but he does appear to favor a course determined more by personalities and drive to maintain (Eisenhower) or gain (Monty) command of ground forces.  One can certainly not dismiss Murray's thesis as the evidence suggests that a fair bit of posturing by Monty resulted from his desire to be overall ground forces commander.  Eisenhower expended a lot of energy over from summer to early fall of 1944 rebuffing Monty's requests for command, but his reasons for turned down the requests were not apparently as trivial as ego.  In his attempt to put the debate in the laps of the two top commanders, Murray fails to give enough argument to the other contributing factors, such as logistics and politics.<br /><br />Murray's basic approach, in terms of how he presents the \\"evidence\\" in support of his thesis, is to summarize the writings of others; namely the two main personalities - Eisenhower and Montgomery, their supporting \\"lieutenants\\", journalists, and official military historians from the wars end to the mid 1960's.  Certainly Murray is able to collect the opinions of those closest to the debate but in focusing on the personalities Murray misses the bigger picture.  All is not bad though as Murray does applaud the works of the official historians as most unbiased and likely to paint the clearest picture; so true.<br /><br />In the end Murray' work is narrow in focus but generally solid.  The book is fairly easy to read and one does get a decent picture of the personalities involved in some of the most important decisions made in Northwestern Europe in 1944.  Murray provides the reader with a good set of citations from which to get a deeper picture.

What makes Buckley's truly spectacular is the fact that he not only challenges this wisdom but uses thorough and detailed research to leave the reader with a clear picture that British armor was in fact effective and made a significant contribution within the doctrine and contexts they were employed.<br /><br />British Armour in the Normandy Campaign is separated into nine logically distinct chapters:<br /><br />1) Introduction - in this first chapter Buckley sets the stage of the book by introducing the aforementioned conventional wisdom and posing his thesis that this is an incorrect interpretation of the facts as told by the bigger picture.  Brief discussions of several engagements are used as particular examples of how the believed ineffectiveness of British armor requires more detailed analysis.  This is a very insightful chapter that sets the tone of the exceptional research and unbiased approach Buckley takes throughout the book.<br /><br />2) Fighting the Campaign - In this chapter Buckley gives a lucid description of major engagements the British (and Commonwealth) armored forces took part in from June to Aug of 1944.  There is also considerable discussion of the organization of the various armored forces employed and their Orders of Battle.  Because Buckley's combat prose is presented from the standpoint of facts not the human component this chapter (and later battle discussions) is fairly dry reading.  Yet, little is wasted on fluff and in many ways this is refreshing.<br /><br />3) Operational Technique - Here Buckley presents a clear picture of the British operational doctrine and command structure.  In the previous chapter combat was discussed, and in this chapter we get a sense of what British commanders were thinking and how they were trained doctrinally to think.  In the following chapter these two pieces are put together.<br /><br />4) Fighting the Battle - In this chapter Buckley discusses the engagements introduced in the second chapter within the context of doctrine and command (discussed in the previous chapter).  In doing so Buckley paints a fuller and more critical picture of the British armor and their actions in Normandy.<br /><br />5) The Tank Gap - Any discussion of armored actions are incomplete without a critical analysis of opponent capabilities.  Again conventional wisdom is that the British (and Allies in general) were significantly out gunned, out armored, and tactically deficient when compared to the Germans.  While the German armor had many features superior to those of the Allies this commonly held view is naïve.  Buckley clears the air on this topic very well and thoroughly.  As should be pointed out in ALL discussions of armored clashes in northwestern Europe in the first couple of months following the invasion, a phenomenon Buckley terms \\"Tiger-phobia\\" is probably most responsible for the prevailing wisdom of Allied armor inferiority.  In particular, most accounts of armored battles in Normandy point to the overwhelming power of Tiger and Panther tanks when in fact the tank most often encountered by Allied armor was the similarly shaped (but much smaller) Panzer Mark IV.  The fear of Tigers and Panthers created a mystique related to German armor that has survived 60 plus years!  Certainly these latter two AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) were fearsome machines but they suffered from many shortcomings.  Moreover, there were simply too few of them deployed.  In addition to clearing the air on this important topic, Buckley does a fair and balanced job describing the strengths and weaknesses of Allied armor.  Additionally he makes a clear case that a less than ideal and relatively weakAFV does not therefore make a machine unable to win battles if employed within proper doctrinal boundaries.  This chapter is quite amazing!<br /><br />6)  Design and Planning - This chapter continues the discussion of the previous chapter but explores the issue of armor, less from a technical standpoint (e.g. who's gun was bigger, who's armor less protective, etc.) and more from a logistics and strategic one.  This is essential information for the reader as it places the study within a doctrinal context and the mindset of the command staff.  Without knowing how the British came to the decisions they did about armor design, employment and improvement one can not fully appreciate the bigger picture - the British armor was effective and significant to the Allied offensive.<br /><br />7) Production and Supply - This chapter is a logical extension of the previous chapter and explains much about why particular AFVs (e.g., the M4 Sherman) was employed en masse when potentially superior machines (e.g., A27M Cromwell) were part of the Allied repertoire.  This chapter, like the previous one, is essential to gain a fair picture of the British armor in Normandy.<br /><br />8) Morale and Motivation - This chapter addresses the human factor that makes or breaks any military unit: the solider, or in this case tankers and AFV fighting troops (including armored infantry).  Once again Buckley questions a conventional wisdom: namely that British armored troops in Normandy exhibited poor morale and little will to fight.  While there are certainly cases of poor morale and a fair number of AWOL and desertions cases the picture is not as simple as the tail of numbers.  Again Buckley provides the larger pool of facts necessary to draw fair conclusions.<br /><br />9) Conclusion - In the final chapter Buckley provides a concise summary of the questions at hand and the answers presented.  Very nice ending to a fabulous book.<br /><br />In the final analysis Buckley's British Armour in the Normandy Campaign is a wonderful read.  Few historical works present a clear thesis that is followed through on in such a thorough fashion with fairness and virtual lack of bias.  This book represents a guide for how this type of historical work should be approached.  5 HUGE stars!!!efore make a machine unable to win battles if employed within proper doctrinal boundaries.

Parker's \\"Battle of the Bulge: Hitler's Ardennes Offensive, 1944-1945\\" is one of the best of the books out there on this, the last dying grasp of the German war machine at the heady days of 1940 in the West.  Originally published in 1991, this 2004 edition includes several new additions (including new photos and reference materials) to bring this classic historiography into the present for the reader.  Certainly \\"Battle of the Bulge\\" is deserving of the praise it has received, but why?  Three reasons: outstanding research, expert organization, and stylish writing.<br /><br />Outstanding Research: Parker did his homework for this one!  Unlike so many who write military history, especially WWII history, with a provincial or nationalistic perspective, Parker tells the story from both sides of the \\"fence\\". Certainly the U.S. Army is front and center but given the make up of the victorious Allied forces this is not altogether unfair.  Readers are treated to various aspects of Bulge history (see next section), not just prose dedicated to combat, but order of battle information for both Allied and German forces, summaries of weapons utilized, views from the top during planning phases, execution and response, and erasure of the Bulge (again from both sides).  Moreover, Parker has provided a number of fabulous photographs, many in the \\"then-and-now\\" vein.<br /><br />Expert Organization: Although Parker covers a lot of diverse material related to the Battle of the Bulge (from combat to logistics and post-war museums and battle games), he (and/or his editor) organizes his story in such a way that readers are unlikely to become bored even if not interested in all the individual components.  Whether simply related to subject matter or Parker's style of writing, the battle passages, which are interspersed within other topics, are often dry and somewhat difficult to follow.  Yet, not clumping them together makes the book flow more easily.  Moreover, Parker balances the length of sections quite well such that there are numerous logical places to \\"rest\\".  Although topics are mixed chapter to chapter, this is not to say that Parker lacks a larger organization or that the book is a random collection of facts.  In fact Parker clumps chapters together into five larger \\"sections\\":<br /><br />1) The Setting - this section contains seven distinct chapters, the last three each containing additional sub-chapters.  In total The Setting describes the planning phase of Wacht am Rhein, the status of the \\"Ghost Front\\" in the weeks and days leading up to the jump-off, the mindset and leadership of the Allied camp before the German attack, and how the logistics of a battle in the Ardennes could be influenced by the Ardennes itself.  Parker's prose provides ample information to educate even the most naïve of readers.<br /><br />2) The First Days: We March - this section is separated into six distinct chapters, the fifth having a sub-chapter.  The first five chapters deal with the attackers and their armies (Fifth Panzer Armee, Sixth Panzer Armee, and Seventh Armee), the leadership and it's methods, and lastly a description of the first day of battle (again generally from the perspective of the German side).  The last chapter of this section describes the Allied reaction to the surprise attack, which can be fairly called chaotic in the first day.<br /><br />3) Progress of the Battle - this section details the battle from 17 Dec to the end of Jan when the line resembled that of 15 Dec.  This is by far the most battle detailed portion of the book with more than half of the 200-odd pages covering the action from both sides.  Filling out the rest of this section are various pieces of non-combat storyline including views from the top (again from both Allied and German perspectives), affects on the civilian population, and views of the combat from embedded non-combatants of the press corps.  In addition, \\"Progress of the Battle\\" includes a number of important sub-stories of the bigger Bulge story, like the SS atrocities at Malmedy where US PWs were executed in cold-blood.  Parker's fair-handedness comes shinning through in this section as he covers the events without making excuses for the SS but while making sure that the reader knows that the Germans were not the only ones to have committed acts beyond those normally accepted in war.<br /><br />4) Looking Back - this sections details the price paid by both combatants (personnel, armaments, time, psychological effects), how the Bulge fits into the larger picture of the War, and the why's the battles outcome - why did the Germans lose their great gamble?  This section provides a nice wrap-up of the rest of the book in a bigger historical perspective. Fabulous!<br /><br />5) Appendices - In addition to Order of Battle information oft present in Appendices of military history, Parker's contains a wonderful \\"recommended reading list\\" (with book descriptions), information on Bulge periodicals, films (both Hollywood-type and documentaries), and simulation games, and a discussion of Ardennes museums and tours.  This section alone makes Parker's book a critical resource for the serious.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Battle of Bulge\\" by Danny Parker is a \\"classic\\" piece of military history, told with style and full of expertly researched information.  Parker's book is a cross between John Toland's \\"Battle\\" (engaging story written with flair) and Charles MacDonald's \\"A Time for Trumpets\\" (deep with facts and emotion).

Robert E. Merriam's Dark December might be just what you're looking for.  Amazingly balanced, given that Merriam was with the official US Army historical section, Dark December takes the reader on a journey that covers all the significant topics.  Merriam describes the circumstances leading to the conception of Wacht Am Rhein (Watch on the Rhine)/Herbstnebel (Autum Smoke), planning of the offensive, implementation of one of the most effective deception plans of WWII, overviews of the pitched battles, and the American counteroffensive (and Hitler's secondary offensives).  The structure of Dark December also goes a long way towards conveying the story in a fair light, one which the reader can draw some conclusions for his/her self.<br /><br />Merriam divides his book into seven major sections. The first deals with the why's of Wacht Am Rhein and how it came to be.  Merriam gives a thorough yet concise back-story to place proper context around the last great offensive of the mighty Wehrmacht.  The second section is directly related to the first in that it describes the events on the American side of the line and decisions made by Eisenhower and staff during the months leading up to 16 December 1944.  What's particularly striking about these sections (and others in the book) is that Dark December was written a mere two years after the German surrender and is based on Merriam's experiences and diaries, historical section documents and interviews with leading Wehrmacht personalities (e.g., Jodl, Goering, Peiper, etc).  This is not a book based on other books but one based solely on primary sources and without years of hindsight with which to massage conclusions!<br /><br />The third section deals mainly with the weeks and days before the offensive and the masterful deception the Germans were able to perpetrate, and how and why the US Army fell for it.  Again Merriam is fair and balanced in his treatment, pointing out honest reasons for the success of the German deception and dispelling myths that had been perpetuated (many of which unfortunately still exist today, nearly sixty years later).<br /><br />Sections IV and V detail the first ten days of the offensive (16-26 Dec).  Don't expect the human and small unit detail of John Toland's Battle: The Story of the Bulge or Charles MacDonald's A Time for Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge, it isn't here.  Merriam instead chooses to dedicate his 84 pages of these two sections to general coverage of major actions at essentially Divison, Corps and Army levels.  There are a few examples of exceptional stands by small groups of soldiers but mostly Merriam's prose tells the bigger picture.  This approach works exceedingly well with the rest of the book.<br /><br />The sixth section of the book describes the last offensive actions of the Germans and the switch of momentum to the Allied side.  Merriam does not shy from telling the good and the bad of both sides.  Again this was somewhat surprising given the essentially US Army source of the text.<br /><br />In the final section of the book Merriam summarizes the loss and gains of both German and Allied sides, as well as recounting many of the myths of the Ardennes Offensive and their \\"true\\" stories.  This is a wonderful way to end a solid historical account.  If only more current-day author/historians would take such a synopsis/conclusions approach to the finale of their books!<br /><br />In the end, while the story told in Dark December is not new compared to the plethora of Bulge histories currently available one should keep in mind when this book was published - 1947, at which time this was nearly ALL NEW!  Despite its age, Dark December is a wonderful resource.  Merriam crafts a well balanced and fair telling of the Ardennes Offensive and does so with creative flair that makes the book fun to read as well as educational.  I can't recommend this book enough.  Although currently out of print I found a copy at the University of Missouri library and I encourage others to search out a copy of this fabulous book.  I only wish I had read it sooner.l as educational.  I can't recommend this book enough.

US	44851296	RC0I0F7OPNGOJ	0765311992	254001929	The Americans at Normandy: The Summer of 1944--The American War from the Normandy Beaches to Falaise	Books	5	16	18	N	N	An American perspective to a truly American story	With so many books written (many over the past few years) about D-Day, hedgerow fighting, and exploitation to drive the German war-machine back to the Fatherland, what makes John McManus' \\"The Americans At Normandy\\" special?  In short, why should someone interested in World War II history pick up this book over any one of the plethora of other on the subject?  Quite simply, \\"The Americans At Normandy\\" is a unique contribution to the genre as it brings material together from several distinct sources to tell a broad-portrait story of America's citizen soldiers and their fight to free Europe from the grips of fascism.  Having said this, most of what McManus covers is not particularly new, nor does he shed new insight on old topics.  Rather, McManus does what so few historians attempt, and so few other achieve - to tell an encompassing and gripping story that maintains historical depth while not causing mass sleep induction.  Broad-portrait stories are most usually either shallow in depth, or deep but arduous reading.  \\"The Americans At Normandy\\" falls into neither of these common traps!<br /><br />McManus' first contribution to his Normandy duet, \\"The Americans At D-Day\\", was a solid book but lacked significant punch to set it apart from other works covering D-Day.  Being American Army-centric one could also argue that \\"The Americans At D-Day\\" lacked depth necessary to convey the weight of the allied invasion of Europe in June 1944.  However, with \\"The Americans At Normandy\\", McManus redeems himself wholly.  Yes, McManus' second contribution is also American-centric but for this book he can be forgiven as the battles within, and breakout from, the bocage country involved the Germans and Americans almost exclusively - remember the Brits and Canadians were bogged down around and in Caen while the American Army slugged its way through the Cotentin, Upper Brittany and Bocage.  In \\"The Americans At Normandy\\", McManus treats the reader to a detailed story of how the citizen army of the United States fought a tenacious opponent (seemingly always better on defense than offense) and drove a wedge through the tough crust to breakout into the plains of France and onto the Seine and Paris.  This is a wonderful story, not told in such completeness of theatre and still from an American-centric position elsewhere.<br /><br />In his acknowledgements McManus thanks his executive editor at Forge (press) for suggesting that McManus' work be broken into two volumes.  As McManus himself states, \\"...this was fortunate...[and] reflects sage wisdom and knowledge of the publishing world and history in general\\".  Indeed.  McManus was fortunate to have an editor that suggested this approach.  McManus did the work of researching and writing but the editors and publishers package the product.  This was a joint venture for a home run!<br /><br />This reviewer's critique of McManus' \\"The Americans At D-Day\\" (here at Amazon) was quite harsh in terms of credit given (or my perceived lack thereof) to researchers who walked the path before McManus.  As a particular example this reviewer brought up the phenomenal work of Mark Bando in \\"Vanguard of the Crusade\\" which McManus used quite liberally in \\"The Americans At D-Day\\".  Once again Bando's work comes into focus with \\"The Americans At Normandy\\".  In this case McManus draws not only from \\"Vanguard\\" but also Bando's unique contribution to the Normandy literature - \\"Breakout At Normandy\\".  But wait - unlike the apparent neglect to properly credit Bando's work in \\"The Americans At D-Day\\", McManus heaps praise on Bando's work in his notes to \\"The Americans At Normandy\\" (p. 464).  Moreover, while McManus gave near-reverent thanks to \\"academic\\" historians in his acknowledgements to \\"The Americans At D-Day\\", while forgetting equally important historians not part of the ivory establishment (e.g., Bando), he includes these latter figures in his current acknowledgements - sandwiched amongst his academic peers.  It thus appears that John McManus deserves this reviewers apology for previous suggestions that McManus played favorites with \\"academic historians\\" - I sincerely apologize!<br /><br />In the end, John McManus' \\"The Americans At Normandy\\" is a tour-de-force book that provides a big picture of the American combat experience in Normandy, from D+1 (7 June 1944) until late August when the armored spearheads where rush across the French plains to Paris, that has not been presented previously.  This is a serious piece of historical literature and will stand the test of time.

US	44851296	RCEM41LODUHSA	0743226062	415475598	Climb to Conquer: The Untold Story of WWII's 10th Mountain Division Ski Troops	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Perfect mix of skiing, mountaineering and combat	Climb To Conquer: The Untold Story of World War II's 10th Mountain Division Ski Troops is an engaging story of one the US Army's most specialized organizations of WWII.  Outdoor and skiing enthusiast Peter Shelton has done the men of the 10th Mountain Division justice with Climb To Conquer.  Unlike the more recent, Boys of Winter by Charles J. Sanders, Shelton's book is a solid piece of historical literature.<br /><br />Climb to Conquer is divided into four basic topical sections:<br /><br />1) The Prologue and first seven chapters (with the exception of chapter 5) are dedicated to telling the story of how the \\"US Ski Troops\\" were conceived, formed and trained.  Shelton thankfully opts not to present Climb To Conquer with the who's-who of skiing approach that Sander's took with his book.  Instead Shelton gives background information about the genesis of the ski troops (initial Army outfit being the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment) and its most vocal and active proponents (C. Minot \\"Minnie\\" Dole and no less than Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall) within a context of the pre- and post-Pearl Harbor US military without cluttering it with unnecessary name dropping and ski-laden references.<br /><br />2) The second section, which can be seen as being comprised of Chapters 5 and 8-13, is the \\"battle meat\\" of the book.  While Chapter 5 sits physically in the middle of the first topical section of the book it in fact tells the story of the first armed actions of the 87th Mountain Regiment on Kiska - one of the Aleutian Islands.  This is a fascinating story told well by Shelton.  Charged with driving Japanese defenders from the Island, the 87th spilled its first blood on Kiska.  Unfortunately Kiska represents a tragedy in the history of the 10th Mountain Division since the casualties sustained were not the result of Japanese defenders (who had vacated the island weeks earlier in a stealthy escape through a US Navy blockade worthy of its own retelling) but rather from friendly fire of fellow 87th soldiers.  Confusion and chaos reigned on Kiska and none of the survivors forgot their terrible experiences.<br /><br />Chapters 8-13 detail the exploits of the 10th Mountain Division as it entered the ETO in late 1944.  Shelton does a good job describing the actions of the 10th (and other units of the US Fifth Army under Maj. Gen. Mark Clark) in the Italian Appennine Mountains, through to the Po River Valley, and the final race with the Wehrmacht to their supposed Alpine Redoubt in the Austrian Alps.  Shelton's prose in the \\"battle chapters\\" is such that it holds the readers attention and draws then along with the story.  Very well written from a pure reading standpoint.<br /><br />3) The third section of the book is represented by a single chapter (14) and details the time men of the 10th spent in the European mountains after their fighting was over.  While there is not a lot of text associated with this section it provides an interesting tie-in to the final section of the book.<br /><br />4) The fourth and final section (Chapters 15 and 16) of the book describes the exploits and accomplishments of the veterans of the 10th at home after the war.  Again Climb To Conquer, unlike The Boys of Winter, does a good job detailing how men of the 10th were instrumental in the establishment of the US ski industry.  As was the case with his discussion of the formation and training of the mountain troops, Shelton places this final section within the larger context of how these things came to pass in many ways because of the training and combat experiences of the 10th veterans.  Sanders failed to do this with The Boys of Winter.  Moreover, Shelton doesn't limit his post-war accolades of the 10th Vets to their influence on the ski industry but rather makes a strong point of the critical importance of their work on environmental and conservation issues.  These were mountain-men who had seen the devastation of man in war and vowed to protect nature's beauties.  This final section provides the most unique sub-story to the history of the 10th Mountain Division.<br /><br />Concluding remarks: While the sub-title (The Untold Story of World War II's 10th Mountain Division Ski Troops) of Climb To Conquer is misleading - this is certainly not an untold story as many books about the 10th have proceeded Shelton's book, Peter Shelton has crafted a sound piece of unit history that also represents a noteworthy human story.  Climb To Conquer is an easy-to-read, hard to put down and a solid 4 stars.nature's beauties.

US	44851296	R38RHE3BWYZ3ON	097176509X	30937158	Slaughterhouse: The Handbook of the Eastern Front	Books	5	185	189	N	N	Want to know about the Eastern Front - Start HERE!	The encyclopedic content of Slaughterhouse: The Handbook of the Eastern Front (Keith Bonn, ed.) more than justifies its subtitle.  Previously published by the Military Book Club, this updated trade paper version from The Aberjona Press is full of information and will provide neophyte and seasoned students of history alike with plenty of brain-food.  Although different sections of the book were written, or information compiled, by several different historians, editor Keith Bonn has fashioned a seamless text that is rare in such multi-authored works.  No less surprising is the group of respected historical researchers Bonn has brought together to create Slaughterhouse.  Certainly the contributions of David M. Glantz, who is one of the foremost American experts on the Soviet war machine of the Second World War, provide significant clout to this project.  Scott McMichael and Yuri and Natalia Khonko provide additional research on the Soviet side, while the German side of the equation is brought to life through the combined efforts of Steve Myers, Hugh Foster, Marc J. Rikmenspoel, and Bonn himself.  Rikmenspoel's recently published work, Waffen-SS Encyclopedia, amply demonstrates the talent of this young historian.  Slaughterhouse is a serious work worthy of critical praise as a bench-standard of researched history of the Eastern Front.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse is organized into seven basic sections:<br /><br />First, an Introduction section by Glantz (pp. 1-14) provides necessary context for one to appreciate, again or for the first time, the importance of the Eastern Front and the Soviet contribution to the defeat of Nazi Germany - this latter point being frequently downplayed by Western historians and culture alike.  This section should be REQUIRED reading for ALL those interested in WWII history, especially those who feel the Western Front was the \\"end-all.\\"<br /><br />Second, Slaughterhouse also provides a chronology of events on the Eastern Front (pp. 15-66) to bring the reader along on the major events from beginning (events before the outbreak of war) to the end (German capitulation and the start of Soviet occupation of eastern Germany).  This section includes both bulleted facts (for quick reference) and text to expand and explain the bulleted facts.  Amazing work, concise and full at the same time!<br /><br />Third, short biographical essays of both German (pp. 67-112) and Soviet (pp. 113-146) military commanders are provided.  As many of the German commanders also led troops on the Western Front (and sometimes in Africa) many of these personalities are well known to American readers.  For this reviewer, the Soviet commanders stand in stark contrast in this regard - most being essentially unknown to us in the West, with a few notable exceptions (Zhukov, Vasilevsky, Konev and Chuikov).  These biographies synopsize important facts related to the military accomplishments of these men and their relationships to events on the Eastern Front.  This section provides plenty of new material for those not well versed with Eastern Front history and is a great introduction to these personalities.<br /><br />Fourth, unit organization and action summaries (chronological) are presented for over 1,000 (yes, that's right) German [and German allies'] (pp. 147-298) and Soviet (pp. 299-390) units involved in fighting on the Eastern Front, from the division level and above.  This section of the book is by far the most encyclopedic portion.  The information is presented clearly in tabular/column format such that one can find units and dates easily.  Again, as was the case with the German commanders, many of the German units also served on other fronts and we are not deprived of that information (a real bonus!).  Certainly anyone looking for summaries of division-level and above actions on the Eastern Front need not look beyond Slaughterhouse.

US	44851296	R3CMKCOM0USZK0	0760306540	897061161	Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Third Army owes its reputation in part to 2nd Armored	Breakout at Normandy: The 2nd Armored Division in the Land of the Dead is a wonderfully crafted and riveting story that fills a nearly complete void in one of the most heralded Allied actions of the post-D-Day period of World War II.  While many know of the hard fought battles through the hedgerow-bocage country of western Normandy in June-July of 1944, and the subsequent breakout and sprint to the Seine in August (with most credit generally going to Patton's Third Army), little has been accurately written about the breakthrough that lead to this shift in action.  Historian-author Mark Bando has done considerable research to bring this story to the reader.  Breakout at Normandy is not the kind of re-hashed history so commonplace with many of today's more \\"popular\\" authors in the genre.  Instead of relying on other historians for the majority of his information, Bando engages in the \\"historical ground battles\\" himself, interviewing veterans on both sides (American and German), consulting and researching official military documents (again from both sides), touring the battlegrounds, and collecting photographic support for the story he tells.  Too few authors in the WWII genre are also historians in the same sense as Bando.  This guy takes his profession seriously!<br /><br />Breakout at Normandy is separated roughly into four major parts: 1) pre-breakthrough background (Chapters 1 and 2); 2) the actions of the 2nd Armored Division to generate the breakthrough (Chapters 3-12); 3) the wildly successful defense of the breakthrough against retreating German forces (Chapters 13-18); and 4) breakout and post-breakout actions (Chapters 19 and 20).  The second and third sections make up the bulk of the book and represent a significant piece of research.  Components of the first and last sections are more well known but help to place the actions of the 2nd Armored to generate the conditions for the Breakout understandable and historically placed.  Bando's research has clarified several points of misinformation that had been previously associated with Operation Cobra - Bradley's First Army (of which 2nd Armored Division was a component) operation to free themselves from the hedgerows.  First and foremost, Bando drives home the fact that the breakthough in Normandy was the result of First Army actions not Patton's Third Army (to which so much is often credited), and that without the combat actions of First Army, and notably 2nd Armored, Patton's breakout, which is now legend, would not have occurred.  Another example of the author's ability to clarify previous historical inaccuracies can be found in his discussion of the death of SS-Obersturmbannf&uuml;hrer Christian Tychsen.  While the not all of the missing time associated with the death of Tychsen has been accounted for, Bando does an admirable job recounting the most likely sequence of events.  In fact, as the author states in his Acknowledgements, the strange and confused history of Tychsen's death is what initially drew him to the story of Operation Cobra.  Bando weaves this and many other intriguing and profound combat stories into a gripping prose that both holds the readers attention and teaches as well.<br /><br />The only aspect of Breakout at Normandy that is disappointing is the curious lack of maps.  This reviewer has learned from the author that in fact several made were generated (hand-drawn by the author himself) and produced for the book but the publisher - in his/her infinite wisdom - told the author \\"they were not necessary\\"!!  This is a truly unfortunate thing for Bando since Breakout at Normandy should be required reading for thee serious students of WWII and such a grave omission by his publisher (MBI Publishing Inc) has likely contributed to the book being lost to the masses.  Thankfully Bando's recent chronicle of the 101st Airborne, Vanguard of the Crusade, was published by a top-notch outfit, Aberjorna Press, who recognize the value of research and use of variousmedia results from that research (e.g., maps, photographs, etc) and allowed Bando to tell a complete self-standing story.<br /><br />Bando has a unique gift for research and compilation of information, and it is indeed sad that his work is not being read more widely.  Fortunately other historians recognize his talents as they use his material (and thus HIS research) to create their own stories.  Breakout at Normandy is a 5 star book that will engage the reader, and although currently out of press, those wanting a solid piece of historical literature should seek out a copy!  If you see Mark Bando's name cited by other authors recognize that he is one of a group of historian-authors who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty or feet bloodied in pursuit of accurate history - and has done so without popular accolade.  We should all give guys like Mr. Bando a nod for their hard work at preserving history not simply writing popular stories.media results from that research (e.g., maps, photographs, etc) and allowed Bando to tell a complete self-standing story. <br /> <br />Bando has a unique gift for research and compilation of information, and it is indeed sad that his work is not being read more widely.

Sanders' attempt to tell the story of the 10th Mountain Division from formation to the end of war in the ETO (plus brief discussion of post-war adventures of veterans).  Unfortunately it is not an attempt that succeeds from the standpoint of a piece of military history.  On the other hand Sanders has created a highly readable story about skiers-turned soldiers.  In fact, if one is interested in skiing, the history of American ski resorts and learning the who's-who of 30-40's skiing The Boys of Winter might be for you.  However, if you're looking for solid unit combat history this is not it!<br /><br />Sanders' book can be separated into four topical sections: 1) introductions of the three central characters of the book (pp. 1-57) - Rudy Konieczny, Jake Nunnemacher, and Ralph Bromaghin; 2) formation and training of the Eighty-seventh Mountain Regiment (the precursor unit to the 10th Mountain Division) (pp. 58-116); 3) Deployment of the 10th Mountain Division to Italy in January 1945 and the subsequent four months spent battling German troops (pp. 117-192); and 4) discussion of what became of 10th Mountain Division men who survived (pp. 193-204).  The first, second and fourth sections are mainly devoted to skiing adventures, ski racing, and the personal lives of the three central characters and other notables of the skiing world.  Sanders clearly knows skiing history and can name drop with the best of them.<br /><br />In contrast, the third section of the book, which is really the only section with significant military focus, is not particularly good history.  Sanders' prose in this section is very readable but not very deep.  His narrative relies almost exclusively on second and third-hand accounts and is rarely substantiated by other materials (e.g., after-action reports, official U.S. Army documents, German Army documents).  There is amazing human value in accounts made by the men who were there but the most reliable, accurate and sound history is that which combines information from multiple sources - both emotionally attached and not.  Here Sanders fails.  In many cases Sanders' writing style, while engaging to the reader, will also annoy the more serious students of WWII history.  Two examples are particularly obvious and prevalent.  First, Sanders refers to the Germans simply as \\"Nazis\\" in almost every context where he is writing the prose himself.  In contrast, when Sanders is quoting 10th Mountain Division veterans the term Nazi is rarely (if at all) used.  Take note Mr. Sanders - not all Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS soldiers, or Germans in general for that matter, were Nazis.  It is simple wrong to refer to WWII German soldiers as \\"Nazis\\" broadly.  Is it fair to call Hitler's regime Nazi? Yes.  But not the German soldiers as a whole.  The veterans didn't use the term for a reason!  As a second example, Sanders also appears to create his own set of U.S. Army unit designations.  For example, in a reference to B Company/87th Infantry Regiment/10th Mountain Division Sanders uses the shorthand designation \\"Company 86-B\\" (p. 152).  This is in no way a standard U.S. Army designation.<br /><br />In the final tally, The Boys of Winter is a four-star book from the standpoint of readability but a 1.5 star effort for military history.  Total score: 2.5 stars.  If you want a well-written human story that is skiing centric this might be one to pick up.

US	44851296	R3SPG1ZG2YDZ29	0971765081	278472343	Waffen-SS Encyclopedia	Books	5	85	89	N	N	Truly encyclopedic, expertly-researched & well-written	Marc J. Rikmenspoel's Waffen-SS Encyclopedia is a tour-de-force piece of military history.  Certainly encyclopedic in content but written with a literary flair that makes it readable - this is not Encyclopedia Britainica der Waffen-SS!  Rikmenspoel wastes few words in the 285 pages of Waffen-SS Encyclopedia.  For example, right at the outset he states that his purpose is not to \\"rehash, cut or paste material from previously published works to create a new volume on the subject\\", but rather to provide in one work a source of valuable and accurate information related to five basic topics: 1) the order of battle for various Waffen-SS formations; 2) the personnel makeup of these units - with added emphasis on \\"Germanic\\" formations; 3) summaries of some of the more notorious and decorated leaders of the Waffen-SS; 4) generalized and specialized weapons usage in various units; and 5) an introduction to some common misconceptions and controversial topics associated with the Waffen-SS.  Rikmenspoel hits a home run on all counts!<br /><br />The most encyclopedic portion of the book is the first section dedicated to the order of battle for various units (pp. 1-58) and structure of Waffen-SS divisions (pp. 59-82).  As is inherent in this type of information, the facts are the facts.  Rikmenspoel doesn't clutter the facts with a lot of non-sense drivel.  Yet, he provides enough text to make this section readable.  In addition to the dry facts (unit makeup, history of command, etc.) the author provides a synopsis of combat history and organization-reorganization of these combat units.  These histories are expanded and tied together textually in later sections, thus tying in the \\"dry\\" matter (basic facts) with the \\"meaty\\" matter (larger stories).  The section on weapon usage (pp. 235-250) is also a bit dry textually but provides ample information.  Each of these encyclopedic sections is further supplemented for the reader with great photographs and illustrations - again not a la Encyclopedia Britainica, but tastefully and not wastefully.<br /><br />The second and third sections of the book provide the most griping prose.  The second section is divided between discussion of Germanic (pp. 83-180) and non-German/non-Germanic units (pp. 181-194) of the Waffen-SS, with the first section clearly providing the most interesting fodder for both the author and reader.  Rikmenspoel has more than competently melded an information-rich treatise on the subject with minimal use of space and words.  This in no way should imply that the author cut corners or did minimal research.  Quite the contrary, Rikmenspoel simply condenses material to its minimal components that are necessary and sufficient for reader understanding and education.  Few authors can take such information-dense material from disparate sources, rework it, and put it to paper in a readable prose that maintains the content sufficiently.  Rikmenspoel can and has!  Another perfect example of Rikmenspoel's talent is the third section of the book that is dedicated to some of the leading personalities of the Waffen-SS.  Rikmenspoel chooses to deal not with just the most well known personalities (in fact he doesn't give space to some that might be expected based on previously published works), but with men who \\"deserve\\" to be discussed in an encyclopedia of the Waffen-SS - armed combat units.  In brief, Rikmenspoel presents short histories of the major military leaders of the Waffen-SS, generally those most competent as soldier-leaders and sculptors of the armed SS, not simply those with the most notoriety.  Again, this is a unique talent.  Certainly some will feel that Rikmenspoel has \\"slighted\\" some personalities by not discussing them, but his narrative of lesser-known, but not lesser deserving leaders is worth more than \\"rehashing of previous works\\" (as the author himself states in his Introduction).<br /><br />The last section of the book is by far the \\"hot potato\\" of Waffen-SS Encyclopedia as it deals with issues Rikmenspoel labels \\"misconceptions\\" and \\"controversies.\\"  Anytime an author attempts to examine the crimes of the Nazi regime and the role of the Waffen-SS he/she rides a razor edge.  Rikmenspoel does not attempt to condemn or apologize for war crimes or the roles of Waffen-SS men.  Rather he attempts to point out how historians and students alike can and should approach the subject objectively and with the proper mindset to make logical and historically accurate assessments.  This section of the book could certainly be expanded further in a second volume - one can only hope!<br /><br />If all of these things weren't enough, Rikmenspoel and Aberjona Press have provided the reader with an extra bonus is the form of an annotated bibliography.  The author give a short synopsis of positive/negative attributes of works used to research the book. Too few authors provide this kind of insight into their own thoughts.  Although clearly a serious historian, Rikmenspoel also gives away what is obviously a wonderful sense of humor in the annotation to one of his previous works (Soldiers of the Waffen-SS: Many Nations, One Motto)...you'll just have to pick up Waffen-SS Encyclopedia to see for yourself!<br /><br />Waffen-SS Encyclopedia is a 5 star book from both the perspective of content and readability.

The central characters in this engaging narrative by journalist-author Alex Kershaw are the Beford men of Company A, 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division.  Their's is a story of ultimate sacrifice to the extreme.  The majority of A Company landed in the first wave of Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe on 6 June 1944, departing their landing craft at Dog Green, Omaha Beach near the Vierville draw.  Within minutes nearly all the Company A men were dead in the hail of MG-42 machine gun fire from Wehrmacht positions above the beach that provided the defenders with superior interlocking fields of fire.  It was a slaughter - the Germans shot anyone who moved and some who didn't.  The Americans were on the continent but not cheaply.<br /><br />Kershaw writes in a lilting style that makes The Bedford Boys (as well as his more recent The Longest Winter) quite enjoyable and easy to read.  The story of the Bedford men and those at home they left behind is one that embodies the human spirit, patriotism and sacrifice for country.  Kershaw's tells this amazing story in three parts.  In the first second of the book he describes the events leading up to the American entrance into the Second World War and what lead these Virginians to be part of the National Guard unit that would fight with the 29th Infantry Division.  One common theme seems to have played a large role: the Great Depression and desire of these mean to make a few more dollars by being part-time \\"weekend warriors\\".  Most were farm boys from large families where every dollar mattered.<br /><br />The second section of the book details A Company's training for war, year and one half in England prior to the invasion, and finally the invasion itself.  This section is quite detailed up to the invasion proper but this may not be surprising as nearly all the men who landed in Captain Taylor Fellers Company A unit (the Bedford boys) were killed on the beach and thus haven't been able to tell their stories.  Kershaw struggles somewhat through this section of the book to make a historical impact but ultimately fails.  This is not to say that his narrative is not engaging - it is. Yet it fails to provide new insight into the first wave battle for Omaha.  Readers interested in understanding more about this critical battle are encouraged to read Joseph Balkoski's recent Omaha Beach, which is quite possibly the most thoroughly researched and fullest account of this component of the Normandy landings.  By combining Omaha Beach and The Bedford Boys a reader can get both historical \\"meat\\" and a touching human saga.<br /><br />The last section of The Bedford Boys is by far the most significant contribution to the genre Kershaw has made here.  This last section is dedicated to ETO events after D-Day, the home front and post-war issues.  Kershaw has crafted a story full of human characters with which the reader and feel empathy.  He has captured the pain and pride of those surviving the A Company men.  Although not dealing with military actions per se in this section, Kershaw does an admirable - if not great - job expressing the emotions of proud American families who sacrificed nearly a whole generation of young men to make the world free once again.  One can see, hear and feel the angst, anger and sorrow of Bedford County, and WWII-era America in Kershaw's words.  Even those expecting or wanting a detailed discussion of battles can't help but be moved by these passages.  This portion of the book makes the whole thing worth buying!<br /><br />All in all The Bedford Boys is a solid 4 star book.  Despite some factual problems Kershaw has crafted a fun read that oozes the heart and soul of the Greatest Generation.  If combined with Omaha Beach by Joseph Balkoski readers will walk away with an appreciation for the battle and sacrifice that resulted in an American foothold in the section of Normandy beach between St. Laurent and Vierville-sur-Mer.ach by Joseph Balkoski readers will walk away with an appreciation for the battle and sacrifice that resulted in an American foothold in the section of Normandy beach between St. Laurent and Vierville-sur-Mer. <br />	2005-01-16

This small unit of US GI's can fairly be credited with one of the most significant defensive actions associated with the Battle of the Bulge - Hitler's last gamble to turn the tide of war in the West.  Kershaw spins a riveting yarn of the eighteeen young men who battled until killed (2 members) or captured (the remainder) at the small Belgian town of Lanzerath on 16 December 1944 against an overwhelming force (1st Battalion, Fallschirmjager Regiment 9 - temporarily assigned to 1st SS-Panzer Division).<br /><br />The Longest Winter is separated into three major parts: 1) training and pre-battle actions; 2) The Battle of Lanzerath itself; and 3) captivity, liberation and post-war accolades.  While the second section is the main theme of the book and is written with flair, it is not particularly original.  It was John S. D. Eisenhower who first detailed the Battle of Lanzerath in his 1969 The Bitter Woods.  More recently the actions of the I&R/394th have been competently put to page by Stephen Ambrose (Citizen Soldiers, 1997) and Ronald Drez (25 Yards of War, 2001).  In contrast, the first and third sections of The Longest Winter represent narratives of new information.  Almost all of the actions associated with the I&R/394th are crafted entirely from interviews Kershaw conducted with surviving members of the platoon.  While this provides an engaging narrative with a human feel, it lacks the historical clarity of thoroughly researched material.<br /><br />Kershaw uses a \\"broad perspective\\" storyboard in The Longest Winter.  He intermingles the story of the I&R/394th with the larger story of the Ardennes Offensive and ETO in general.  This style creates a very readable prose that provides a bigger picture.  However, this approach also risks losing the readers interest in the story at the heart of the book - the I&R/394th actions.  Moreover, when moving into broader areas, Kershaw seems to lose historical clarity as many errors of fact can be found throughout these sections.  These errors - such as incorrect references to SS units (e.g., reference to the 1st-SS Panzer Division as being descendent from the original concentration camp guard units, when the SS-Totenkopfverbande was in reality the concentration camp guard and was not related to 1st-SS Panzer Division, p. 54) and names of individuals (e.g., Hermann Black when it should be Hermann Balck, p. 115, 320) - are really hard to understand as Kershaw clearly cites works (in the bibliography) where correct facts are given.  In the case of name problems these could be editorial, but in cases where textual statements are wrong editing was only the last check on Kershaw's research.<br /><br />Final analysis: In the end The Longest Winter is a well crafted and easily read work that lacks depth of analysis and research.  From a reading standpoint this is a 5 star book, from a historical standpoint it gets 2.5 stars.  Total value: 3 stars.le prose that provides a bigger picture.

Stein is a fabulous work of historical literature.  Many an author, popular and academic, has tackled the topic of the SS and Waffen SS but very few have done so in an objective fashion like Stein.  Far too many presentations of the Waffen SS have been from apologist and revisionist authors who fail to recognize and/or admit the complicity of portions of the Waffen SS in the atrocities committed in the name of the NSDAP and Adolf Hitler.  At the other end of the spectrum are those authors, again large in number, who simply paint ALL that served in the Waffen SS with broad strokes of guilt. Stein captures a story that falls between the extremes and thus is more realistic and truthful, and thus more historically accurate with clear lack of hysterics.<br /><br />\\"Waffen SS\\" begins with a historical perspective on the establishment of the SS [initially the Allgemeine (General)-SS] and formation of the earliest incarnations of the armed SS - initially from the units such as the Leibstandarte SS \\"Adolf Hitler\\" (Hitler's Chancellery Guard) and the SS-Totenkopfverbande (Death's Head Units, early concentration camp guards), to organization of the Waffen SS as war approached.  This presentation provides considerable information that allows the reader to connect (or disconnect as appropriate) various components of Himmler's greater SS.  This is critical to the process of a reader drawing objective conclusions about guilt of the Waffen SS in non-combatant war crimes.<br /><br />Stein then spends considerable time discussing the military exploits of the Waffen SS, both early and oft strained integration into the Wehrmacht during the initial phases of the war up to the defeat of France and the AEF, as well as their later fierce and destructive battles fought east across the Soviet Union and their return west in defense.  Stein's prose does not fail to convey a picture of a fanatical and determined fighting force.  Clearly the Waffen SS (especially the early incarnations that were still volunteer and elite) was an accomplished \\"army\\".  Stein also discusses how the elite Waffen SS was in later years of the war converted through conscription (mostly) into a hodge-podge of a force that often was worth very little and sometimes more trouble than it was worth.<br /><br />In the third major section of \\"Waffen SS\\" the author presents a clear and concise (without simply rehashing particular atrocities covered in depth elsewhere) description of crimes that can be connected to the Waffen SS, whether directly or indirectly.  While crimes can clearly be attributed to battle formations, both combatant- and non-combatant-related, it is also clear from Stein's presentation that a majority of Waffen SS units were not likely involved in such events.  This is not to say that Stein presents an apologist view, quite to the contrary - he presents an honest assessment of guilt - the Waffen SS was guilty but it is unfair to claim all units were simply butchers.  Yet equally unfair would be a claim that the Waffen SS was simply an army free of guilt.  When it comes to connections between the Waffen SS and the holocaust the story is one mostly of semantics.  As Stein points out it is beyond doubt that the SS represented the system by which Hitler attempted (and nearly succeeded) to murder all of the European jews and other \\"Untermensch\\" (subhumans).  It is also clear that many of the units involved were, at least on paper, part of the Waffen SS.  Moreover, much of the concentration camp staff turn over was between the camps and the front lines.  Yet it is not at all clear that fighting units of the Waffen SS were directly involved in these acts.  Thus it becomes an issue of semantics because it depends upon how one defines \\"Waffen SS\\".  Again this is not to say that Stein presents an apologist view or one of strict and total condemnation.  In fact Stein presents a picture in which the facts are presented and the reader is free to define the culprits for themselves.<br /><br />In the final section Stein gives a very concise and extremely well written summary.  This section itself is worth the price of the book.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  Stein is liberal in his use of sources and yet it also becomes clear that Gerald Reitlinger's \\"SS: Alibi of a Nation\\" is one he favors and must feel captures much of the story of the SS (although not in the concise manner in which Stein sets out to do - as he states right up front).  This is a five star effort worth a read!!!d and the reader is free to define the culprits for themselves.<br /><br />In the final section Stein gives a very concise and extremely well written summary.

Miller's \\"A Dark and Bloody Ground\\" is a tour de force piece of academic-grade conflict history.  Miller's research is solid and thorough and he covers a lot of ground in 200 or so pages, taking us from the initial commitment of American troops to the forest so oft referred to simply as \\"Hell\\" (by both sides!), through nearly three months of attrition fighting involving parts or all of TEN US Army divisions, to the final capture of the Roer River dams that lie on the other side of that seventy-odd square miles of Hell.  Miller states up front that he wishes to provide a clear and concise overview of the Battles for the Hurtgen in a way previously not done.  In this he is quite successful.<br /><br />With respect to readability, Miller's writing style is quite easy to follow but it is made a bit choppy and (at least initially) hard to follow because he switches between American and German units frequently and unless/until the reader is familiar with which side of the line what unit numbers belong this can make the going tough.  A simple use of italics to refer to German units (for example) would have gone a long way towards providing clarity for the reader.  Robert Rush (or his publisher) used this tactic in his book on the Hurtgen (see comparison to Miller's book below) with great success.<br /><br />The final chapter of Miller's book, entitled \\"Analysis\\" is worth the price of admission for its insights.  Miller provides testimony from commanders who were there and can, looking back, see where problems arose and successes were achieved.  The biggest \\"problem\\" with the battles of the Hurtgen forest, as Miller and his supporting players see it, was the lack of proper tactical goals, namely the Roer River dams.  The dams were not in fact objectives until late in the game after many thousands of casualties were sustained on both sides.  Until these proper objectives were articulated the US Army goal in the Hurtgen was to drive the enemy back and capture roads and settlements, as had been the case in Normandy and Brittany.  Breaching the Westwall was important and laudable but the casualties were not.  Hindsight is always clearer than foresight.<br /><br />\\"A Dark and Bloody Ground\\" is, in the end, a solid piece of historical work worthy of a read.  Despite some potential \\"readability\\" problems Miller has crafted a four star gem.  Anyone interested in learning more about the Hurtgen Forest battles should check out Robert Rush's \\"Hell in the Hurtgen\\" which, unlike Miller's book which deals broadly with the whole campaign, focuses on a single 4th Division Regiment, the 22nd, and its time spent dying in the Hurtgen.

Clark does an admirable job presenting the events leading up to Montgomery's planning of Operation Comet, which in turn lead to the more ambitious Operation Market-Garden, as well as execution and conclusion (unhappy as it was) of the operation, within a 200 pg book.  Not much new here but an honest job well done.  Any lack of new material or revelation is made up for (almost completely) by the GREAT photographs (both vintage and recent author shots of battle locations and monuments) and very nice maps presented.  In total there ~160 such supplements!  Clark also boosts the impact of \\"Arnhem\\" with his brief (17 pgs with illustrations) Conclusions and Afterward chapter in which he tries to place Operation Market Garden in a larger perspective of the Second World War.  Unfortunately this last chapter could have probably gone farther and had more impact if expanded.  In the final analysis, \\"Arnhem: Operation Market Garden, September 1944\\" is a solid 3-3.5 star effort worth the money and time for more serious students of WWII or just interested in this particular period of action on the Western front of the ETO.	2004-11-10

Well documented and stylishly crafted, \\"Decision\\" is an extremely pleasurable read.  This book is much more than a re-telling of the Normandy landing and first few days the Allies spent getting a foothold on the Continent.  Rather, D'Este's book covers ground prior to D-Day - from a look at the future commanders of the ETO and their exploits in North Africa to initial planning by Lt. Gen. Frederick Morgan and his COSSAC group to development of Monty's Masterplan (that represented a revised COSSAC plan) that would become the OVERLORD plan implemented on 6 June 1944 - as well as considerable time and space post invasion (including the many failed attempts to capture Caen which Monty professed to take by the end of D-Day to the American breakthrough in the Cotentin and subsequent exploitation by Patton's Third US Army and drive across Brittany).  There's a lot of information here, all quite expertly presented in a clear enjoyable fashion.<br /><br />One of strongest threads running through \\"Decision\\" is its Monty-centric presentation.  This is in many ways completely natural, while also generally a connection missing in most accounts of the ETO prior to Operation Market-Garden.  So why is a Monty-centric look at the Normandy campaign a natural approach?  First, Monty not only oversaw the development of the final OVERLORD plan but he also served as the C-in-C of Allied ground forces for the invasion.  Second, and probably more importantly, Monty's \\"Masterplan\\" represents a long debated aspect of the Allied adventure.  For example, while it is clear that the both British and Americans made adjustments to Monty's plan as battles developed (though the Americans were generally more adept at it), Monty himself propagated a history of a perfect plan that was followed to the letter.  So why is such a Monty-centric vision of the early ETO lacking in most accounts?  The most likely reason for a more broad view of the Normandy campaign found in most accounts is two-fold: 1) such an approach is less offensive to other major commanders who made considerable contributions, and 2) Monty is \\"protected\\" by broader-based writings.  D'Este has not skirted the issue of Monty.  However, this is not to say that he is a Monty-basher, nor is he a Monty-phile.  D'Este does a very admirable job being fair and balanced in his approach to Monty and his role in Normandy.  D'Este presents a story in which Monty plays a major role - without minimizing the role of subordinate commanders - giving him due credit for things the evidence suggest he deserves credit for and attempting to clarify the many confusing (often enhanced by Monty's self-publicity efforts) aspects of Monty's command to place blame for failures where blame is deserved.  D'Este has done what most historians are apparently incapable of - he has placed enough distance between himself and the subject to present a picture that appears free of tint from personal beliefs and preferences of the historian.<br /><br />In the end \\"Decision in Normandy\\" offers the reader considerable information that is thoroughly researched and expertly presented.  It's a fun read while being simultaneously educational.  Carlo D'Este deserves all the praise he gets for this book.

Second, Balkoski does his scholarly work with literary flair oft missing in such serious works.  This book is plain fun to read. Balkoski doesn't write like C. Ryan, J. Toland, or S. Ambrose, but his writes in a readable style that quickly endears him to the reader.  I found his use of replicated first-hand accounts (after action reports, personal letters, and diary entries) - and to a lesser extent, second-hand after-action Army Historical Division interviews - to supplement his own story-telling quite effective.  It is clear upon reading this book that Balkoski has put his heart and soul into this work, and has done so not with speculation, but by sifting through literally thousands of pieces official historical documents and personal recollections of survivors who were there.<br /><br />If the aforementioned properties of \\"Omaha Beach\\" were not enough, Balkoski's book is also steeped with amazingly detailed and useful maps of action - these have been generated from the research undertaken and present the reader with a very nice picture of where units were over the 24 hour period that was the 6th of June.  I found these maps (there are 27 in total) indispensible! The Appendices of the book are also to be cherished by the reader.  Not simply long lists of references, but also: descriptions of the actions of Medal of Honor awardees on Omaha Beach and names of all the Distinguished Service Cross awardees; lists of total casualties suffered (by unit); a listing of first wave units and commanders to hit Omaha Beach; composition (personnel), uniform and equipments of average units serving on Omaha; detailed notes about the Balkoski's approach to writing \\"Omaha Beach\\"; and finally the appropriate citations of the many works used to produce this wonderful text.  Of particular note in the Appendices is Balkoski's plea to have the US Military to re-review the actions of Gen. N. Cota and Col. G. Taylor on Omaha that were deemed valorous enough for the DSC but not for the Medal of Honor.  Balkoski makes a VERY compelling case that both Cota and Taylor performed in a fashion consistent with that expected of Medal of Honor awardee's.  This reader sincerely hopes that members of the US Army in a position to rattle appropriate chains read \\"Omaha Beach\\" and in fact re-consider these DSC's for MH's.<br /><br />In the end I can't recommend \\"Omaha Beach\\" highly enough.

Aptly edited by David C. Isby, Fighting the Invasion provides a unique pespective on a famous subject.  All interested in WWII and the Allied Invasion of western Europe in particular should pick up this book and add it too their repetoire (especially at the paperbook cost!).  Readers should however take care to note that many of the events written about come from post-V-Day interogations of leading Wermacht players who may have tinged their memories for fear of recrimination and prosecution (this was the post-war period of war crimes trials). Also some of the authors seem to be painting a picture of D-Day events that are fantastic at best, lies at worse.  The chapter by von der Heydte on the actions of the 6th FSR is a prime example - on reading this chapter any knowing nothing of the D-Day events would think the Germans had evrything under control and were driving the Allies back to sea.  Yet, in some chapters important insights are given.  For example, the chapter on the 352nd Division who played such a large part in the defense of Omaha, contains a telephone log (reproduced in entirely) from 0100 of the 6th of June 1944 to the edn of that first day.  While it is clear that confusion existed, a quite obvious and realistic picture (if in hindsight) plays out of how badly things were going as the Allies gained a firm foothold on the continent.<br /><br />Fighting the Invasion is worthy of a read by anyone serious about WWII history - solid 4 stars.	2004-08-30
US	44851296	R1JOE5SJX05XVM	0971765057	792715831	American Iliad: The History of the 18th Infantry Regiment in World War II	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Superbly researched and chronicled Regimental history	American Iliad: The 18th Infantry Regiment in World War II by Robert Baumer and Lieutenant Colonel Mark Reardon (not to be confused with a similarly titled book dealing with the US Civil War) is a tour de force as a regimental history.  Baumer and Reardon have compiled a comprehensive story of the regiment from its inception to the occupation of post-war Germany.  The 350-odd pages are almost devoid of reference to other units except in cases where discussion of non-18th units is necessary for context or in cases where 18th units were integrated into non-18th parent groups.  Thus this truly is a story of a single regiment that fought as part of the Big Red One (US Army 1st Infantry Division) from North Africa to D-Day to the Huertgen and the Ardennes to the Ruhr and the fall of Nazi Germany.  The book is broken up into eleven chapters, starting with prewar organization/training, the long boat ride to war and the regiment's first battles in North Africa (chapters 1 and 2).  These first two chapters provide ample and substantive background on which to place the battle successes (many) and losses (relatively few tactically but often large in terms of human life).  The next four chapters describe actions in North Africa and Sicily.  Chapter 3, The Battle for Longstop Hill is a particularly fascinating one.  While Longstop was in many ways unpleasant for the 18th it was a major turning point for the regiment (and in many ways the US Army as a whole) in North Africa.  Respect from their British comrades was earned the hard way at Longstop.  Chapters 7-9 are centered on D-Day and the fight across France and the low-countries to the Westwall (Siegfried Line), while the subsequent chapter (10) deals with the Battles of the Huertgen Forest and Ardennes (the Bulge).  This latter chapter (and the section dealing with combat around Mortain, France in chapter 8) reveals a lot about the fighting spirit of the men in the 18th Infantry Regiment.  Certainly the Battle of the Huertgen was one of attrition that the Americans ultimately won, with many regiments taking part but few coming out the other end - the 18th was one of the latter.  While not a major player in the Battle of the Bulge, the 18th did its part to stem the tide of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS.  The last chapter deals with the final battles in Western Europe for the 18th and is fresh in many ways since less is generally dedicated to these battles on the western front to those final days on the eastern front and the Battle of Berlin.<br /><br />Strangely, Bauman and Reardon crafted a full and detailed story of the 18th Infantry Regiment in WWII worthy of 5 stars from a historical-standpoint with little literary flare.  American Iliad is often difficult reading from a standpoint of pure reading pleasure.  This reader was reminded of A Time for Trumpets by Charles Macdonald, another classic from the standpoint of content but one far from a classic read for pleasure.  Much of American Iliad runs from one thought to another with little break or reason, despite its factual prowess.  The authors have used just eleven chapters to tell a 359-page story and each chapter runs start to finish with no breaks.  Thus, while a given chapter can deal with multiple battles or events the authors have chosen not to make use of sub-chapter breaks in the text to help the flow.  Unfortunately the lack of such breaks also contributes to the difficulty of the read since there are few logical places to rest except for between chapters.  For those who have ample time to dedicate to their reading and can move through what is thick and dense (historically) prose this may not be a real problem.  However, even for the more serious historical reader may find American Iliad hard reading, not for lack of content certainly, but for flair and style that can make dense reading more enjoyable.  Yet, this is a historical work and the first goal of the authors should have been to provide accurate and factual text - thisthey have done exceedingly well.  That the prose is not like that of C. Ryan or S. Ambrose can thus be forgiven, even if it makes the reading a bit more tedious.<br /><br />In the end Bauman and Reardon have crafted a solid 4 star book (giving each star more weight for historical significance of the work than the authors' story-telling abilities per se) that should be read by any serious student of WWII history, especially those with an interest in single unit histories.  Veterans and soldiers currently assigned to the remaining battalion of the 18th Infantry Regiment have been given a rare gift of unit history that they are certain to cherish.this they have done exceedingly well.

McManus writes with a clear easy-to-read style that helps to make \\"The Americans at D-Day\\" quite enjoyable.  If you have never read a book on D-Day, this is a book that can provide a nice introduction.  Of course be aware that McManus' book deals entirely with American operations relative to Overlord.  If a reader wants a more encompassing look at how the Allies as a WHOLE breached \\"Fortress Europe\\" they should seek other works; such as Cornelius Ryan's \\"The Longest Day\\", Max Hastings' \\"Overlord: D-Day and the Battle for Normandy\\", or John Keegan's \\"Six Armies in Normandy\\", to name a few.<br />Nitty-gritty: One of the most positive aspects of \\"The Americans at D-Day\\" is its organization.  McManus separates the book into two major parts: Planning and pre-invasion (Part1) and the invasion itself (Part 2).  Within each of these major sections he establishes several sub-sections that describe particular aspects.  For example, the role of US Army Air Forces in strategic and support bombing and fighter cover are described both from the angle of planning (the Transportation Plan discussion in Part 1 of the book) and outcomes (Air Cover in Part 2).  Thus, one gets a feel for how things were envisioned as well as the realities of their implementation.  About 1/3 of the book is dedicated to Part 1, while the remainder is given to Part 2.  In Part 2 each \\"branch\\" (or sub-branch in case of US Army units) of the US military is given it's own due.  This is a nice change from the typically simple chronological re-telling oft seen in other D-Day book.  In doing this McManus is able to clearly show how each branch/sub-branch contributed significantly to the outcome of D-Day, in some cases less than expected (e.g., Transportation Plan), in others more (e.g., US Navy fire support of beach landings).  Within each of these sub-sections the story is however generally chronological and thus the reader does not lose the temporal context.  McManus should be applauded for this approach to his storytelling.  I found \\"The Americans at D-Day\\" extremely easy to read and remember because of this organization.<br />Is there only praise for \\"The Americans at D-Day\\"?  No.  McManus has crafted a very readable and historically sound story, yet little is particularly new.  A read of \\"The Longest Day\\" and/or \\"D-Day: The Climatic Battle of WWII\\" (S. Ambrose) and any reader of \\"The Americans at D-Day\\" will be convinced of this.  McManus is gracious in giving credit to HISTORIANS who've written on D-Day with clarity in the past (notably Ambrose and Hastings).  Yet, McManus \\"borrows\\" quite liberally (don't read plagiarize here, rather re-telling of stories told elsewhere with little new enlightenment) from works of Cornelius Ryan (see \\"The Longest Day\\") and Mark Bando (see \\"Vanguard of the Crusade: The 101st Airborne Division in WWII\\") without similar gratitude.  Despite not being academic historians both Ryan and Bando have crafted serious historical pieces worthy of praise - clearly McManus has read works of these authors as he uses material from them and cites them in his \\"Selected Bibliography\\".

Often the term &quot;classic&quot; is thrown around in the literary field without much regard to the real breadth of genre and writings, and is thus cheapened in use.  When one describes Cornelius Ryan's &quot;The Longest Day&quot; as a classic piece in the WWII genre believe it. Such a term is NOT hype when used in the same sentence with this book. So many things about the &quot;The Longest Day&quot; make it truly a classic: First, Cornelius Ryan is a Master storyteller.  Certainly it helps that Ryan was a war correspondent who experienced life in the combat zones of the ETO!  Ryan's writing style is lilting and fun, his writings are easy reads yet full of historical depth.  Sure his books are &quot;popular&quot; reading not simply deep academic works, but they ARE important contributions to the historical literature.  Second, the story is simply one so compelling that even the best novelist would have a hard time toping.  By combining writing talent with a great human story, &quot;The Longest Day&quot; represents literature at its best - in any genre.  Third, historical content - the story told in &quot;The Longest Day&quot; - as just mentioned - is so compelling that it need not be, and was not, embellished to make it readable.  Ryan has done the hard work of culling documents and interviewing numerous sources to gain factual clarity.

Unlike many books that are similarly dedicated to the views from a single soldier, those of Grossjohann are steeped in broad vision.  For example, while individual battles are discussed Grossjohann places them squarely within the context of the overall theatre of operations, making them more than personal snippets of information.  Amazingly, despite this broad perspective, Grossjohann does not get trapped into the position of defending or apologizing for actions of the whole German war machine.  This is a refreshing change from the plethora of recent Axis biographies that have emerged in recent years.  A reader can enjoy Grossjohann's journey in proper context without feeling disgust, anger or pity.  Rather one can walk away feeling one has gotten a rare glimpse into the life of a truly honest and fair soldier who fought bravely for his country - in this case a German rather than Allied soldier.  Quite an amazing experience actually!<br />While \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" does in fact cover (at least) five years and four fronts (as Grossjohann traverses back and forth across Euro-Asia moving from command to command and up through the lower ranks of the Wehrmacht) readers will not get an in-depth look at a large number of battles spanning the entire war.  Rather the reader sees how a good lower-level officer can be move from one situation to the next as needed and how that officer (Grossjohann) perceived his place in this opera.  The combat discussions are in fact quite good but not numerous, so if this is what you are looking for this may not be your cup of tea.  However, if you want more in your personal historical accounts (as I did) \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" soundly delivers.<br />As is typical of so many other Aberjona Press books, it is the extra detail that pushes the book into a \\"must have/must read\\" category.  The Preface provided by T.C. Mataxis, Brigadier General, US Army (retired), sets the stage for a book that is MORE than just another German soldier's story, but rather the story of a warrior demanding respect from peers of all nationalities.  The Historical Commentaries at the beginning of each chapter further set Grossjohann's text within the larger context of the war (spatially and temporally).  These facts together with Grossjohann's style and Aberjona editing make \\"Five Years, Four Fronts\\" a solid 4.5 star book - easy to pick up and read but hard to put down!!d\\" category.

Wilbeck is a great read for those simply curious about tank warfare as well as those more serious about their studies.  Wonderfully written and seriously researched, \\"Sledgehammers\\" fulfilled all my expectations as a historical piece.  My knowledge of German Tiger tanks was probably not that different than many other amateur historians - deep enough to know that most reports of battles with Tigers in \\"popular\\" historical accounts are exaggerated, mistaken and/or poorly researched, but not much beyond that.  Wilbeck, in one single treatise, conveys a concise, useful and exciting history of one of the most feared tanks in the WWII.  Several factors make this a great book:<br />One of the most positive attributes of \\"Sledgehammers\\" is its simple yet very effective organization.  In the first two sections, Wilbeck gives a coherent introduction of the German Heavy Tank Battalions.  By placing the development and implementation of Tiger tank battalions with the context of German thinking (doctrine), technological advances, war planning and execution, Wilbeck makes it easy of the reader to understand the real \\"strengths\\" and \\"flaws\\" of the Tiger's role in the German advances and retreats.  The discussion of German heavy tank Doctrine, or Tiger Battalion Organizations, is worth its weight in gold if one is to truly make sense of the effectiveness of these battalions.  As Wilbeck points out the German military leaders were very doctrinal and only in rare cases were there breaks with doctrine at high levels.  Yet on the battlefield where front-line commanders had control, doctrine, while a driving force, was not necessarily law.  Nor was it particularly well applied.  This had both negative and positive influences on the overall effectiveness of the Tigers.<br />The next four sections of the books describe many of the combat missions in which Tigers were employed, from early years in the Desert when the Panzers were king, to the last battles of the war when the huge and expensive King Tigers were sacrificed in the final spasms of the Nazi regimes attempts to yoke the world.  Wilbeck makes every apparent effort to confirm battle data from records of both combatants.  Only in cases where the Soviets are the second combatant are Wilbeck's data weakened by lack of confirmation.  Yet this is due not to a fault of the author, but rather from a simple lack of clear information on the Soviet side.  In such cases Wilbeck is the first to point out the potential pitfalls.  It is refreshing to read a book where the author acknowledges the historical weaknesses of ones own text.  Despite this caveat (which again I point out the author makes clear exists!) these four sections represent the heart of the book and are fascinating.  Wilbeck has a clear writing style that allows the reader to go through the battles with clarity and ease.  The 35 maps, numerous photographs, and multiple tables of data each contribute to the enjoyable and factually rewarding nature of this book.  \\"Sledgehammer's\\" publishing house, Aberjona Press, is quite possibly the finest serving the WWII historical genre with regard to this type of supplemental material.<br />The last two sections of the book (save the Epilogues by Viktor Iskrov and Ray Holt) try to make sense of the data.  Where Tiger tanks effective tools of war or not, and why or why not?  Wilbeck makes a good case for both pros and cons of the Tiger Battalions.  The author demonstrates that the Tiger tank was a VERY effective killing machine, achieving an impressive average kill ratio across the entire time of its employment of just over 12 enemy lost to every 1 Tiger in battle!!!  Even when the horrible mechanical troubles of the Tigers (both I and II), logistical woes, and defensive nature of many battles fought are considered the Tigers still \\"killed\\" over 5 enemy tanks for their own lost (including self destruction).Thus, the Tiger tank has to bee seen as a serious weapon of war.  Yet these numbers are averages and reflect a snap-shot of the entire picture.  Wilbeck makes it clear to the reader that for all of their positive attributes as killing machines the Tigers were also a burden on the German war machine.  Tigers were mechanically unreliable (as compared to the Soviet T-34 or US M4-Sherman), had a small radius of action (again in contrast to the aforementioned Allied tanks), and were so large that most terrain rendered them practically useless as breakthrough weapons for which they were manufactured, if less employed, according to Doctrine.  Moreover, while the Tiger was a lethal machine essentially impervious to enemy when initially added to the cannon of German war material, the Allies were remarkably quick to respond to counter both the Tiger's lethality and thick \\"skin\\".<br />The Prologue and Epilogue of the book also merit mentioned here.  These sections were contributed not by Wilbeck but by soldiers fighting with (Prologue) or against (Epilogue) the Heavy Tank Battalions.  These sections thus provide a unique perspective on this weapon and its impact.<br />All in all I give \\"Sledgehammers\\" five solid stars for content, presentation and overall impact.  If you want solid facts and reasoned analysis about Tiger tanks and their roles in WWII this is THE book to read..  Thus, the Tiger tank has to bee seen as a serious weapon of war.

Gurley is a wonderful memoir of an infantry grunt (lowly buck-Pvt) that paints one of the most realistic and unembellished pictures of war I have ever read.  The story on its own is compelling but Gurley's ability to tell a story with literary style makes this book an extremely enjoyable read, one I found hard to put down.  A rare combination of gifted writer and battle-aged dogface that experienced the facts described!<br />\\"Into the Mountains Dark\\" is not a one-man story steeped in combat history accumulated over periods of months or years (as contrasted to another Aberjona Press book, \\"Black Edelweiss\\" by Johann Voss - which is a great book in its own right), but rather a book chronicling a young mans transformation from a naïve Boston high school kid (and then Harvard freshman) to an aged 19-year old man shaggy in appearance but wise in the ways of life-and-death as taught him by the field of battle over little more than a month in the Vosges Mountains of Eastern France.  The first third of the book details Gurley's experiences late in childhood through his time as an ASTPer (Army Specialized Training Program) and finally his call-up to active duty and training for deployment to the Continent.  The remainder of the book is dedicated to Gurley's time from debarkation in late September '44 to the end of his unit's (1st Battalion, 399th Regiment, 100th Infantry Division) time in the Vosges Mountains, late November '44.  Both parts of the book are fascinating and highly detailed.  The latter trait is derived from the fact that this book, while compiled and published 60-odd years after the events, was taken nearly verbatim from Gurley's personal diaries and notes written at the time of the events discussed.  We thus see the \\"action\\" - whether dealing with anti-Semitism within his ASTP group while at Ohio University, his trials and tribulations of earning the Expert Infantryman Badge at Ft. Bragg, or negotiating the near vertical climb up to \\"Bloody Knob\\" during the final stages of the battle for Hill 462.8 - not through the tainted-glass of time but from the perspective of someone living through the experience without either hindsight or particular foresight.  In this regard \\"Into the Mountains Dark\\" is a truly unique reading experience with respect to most books about WWII.<br />How does the \\"writing from the moment of experience\\" play out?  One clear example is the frantic picture Gurley paints of his emotions as he moves through the experiences.  This is done only with the hindsight of days or weeks at most between the jotting of one passage to the next, and thus it is not sanitized to remove his initial naïve machismo as he trained for deployment and debarked to Europe or the real fear he felt once faced with the reality of combat.  It's all here!  Gurley's discussion of life on the \\"line\\" is one of the most clear and honest I have read (another good example, for different reasons, is \\"Foot Soldier\\" by Roscoe Blunt).  For example, Gurley talks about his many foxholes dug over the month in the Vosges as if they were each a new vaulted-ceiling split-level condo in a posh Boston neighborhood.  Only a man who has lived the experience of enemy shelling at the front lines can speak of a 5 ft deep water-saturated hole in the rock and mud with such passion.  You can \\"see\\" all of the different permutations of his holes as the critical life sustaining shelter and home-away-from-home they were.  An infantry dogface's life on the line is not a constant expenditure of ammunition, but rather periods of digging homes and wanting for food and water, to emotionally and physically draining periods of close order combat.  Gurley neither adds or removes anything - you can experience a foot soldier's life as it was.<br />This is a fabulous book both for content and readability.  I give it a hearty 5 stars!!! Highly recommended for novices and professionals alike.rofessionals alike.	2004-04-27
US	44851296	R3F3E6ULDWV1QN	0971765006	854142749	Vanguard of the Crusade: The 101st Airborne Division in World War II	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Brothers in Arms, Men of Courage and Integrity, and Vanguard	Vanguard of the Crusade: The 101st Airborne Division in World War II by Mark Bando is a truly special chronicle of the 101st Airborne from its time in wait in England prior to the invasion of the Continent to the end of the war and disbanding of the Division.  Vanguard stands as a tribute to those who fought with the Screaming Eagles, whether they survived the war or not.<br />Bando has sculpted his prose from hundreds of interviews and personal diaries (although expressly forbade in combat zones!) of 101st veterans.  With often only snippets of information from any single source, Bando has been able to piece together an engaging history of combat of one of the most elite forces the Allies assembled during the Second World War.  Where possible Bando has reproduced the words of the veterans verbatim within the context of larger discussions lending a feel of authenticity that many other works do not achieve.  Vanguard is not written in the flowery novelette style of so many authors (e.g., Ambrose) and as such may be a \\"difficult\\" read for many less interested in historical events minus the Hollywood feel.  Yet, having said that, anyone interested in how the 101st earned its reputation should not be deterred from tackling this book.  It's a wonderful collection of memories and writings that is weaved into a nearly seamless single story of the Division from England 1943 to late 45 in occupied Germany.  If you want HISTORY - untainted and without opinions based on hindsight of 60 years - this is it.  Bando and the Editorial staff at Aberjona Press have done an incredible job checking, re-checking and verifying information and this fact alone makes this a wonderful piece of historical writing.  One other subtle yet VERY effective editorial trick has been to italicize German unit names. In this way it is always clear who is who without knowing all units by heart.<br />Vanguard of the Crusade represents an indispensable source of fuller information that has not been pre-digested for those less patient for the complete story.  Two obvious examples come to mind: First, many probably think they know the \\"story\\" of the Airborne drop in the Netherlands as part of Operation Market-Garden.  However, the story told in the classic (and both well written and factually sound) A Bridge Too Far by Cornelius Ryan is quite \\"sanitized\\" and abridged with respect to the actions in which the 101st were involved.  Bando does a wonderful job touching on the breadth of the combat situations in which the Screaming Eagles were involved while trying to keep Hell's Highway open.  It is probably fair to assume that many people assume that the 101st fought as a single group in relatively small engagement areas during Market-Garden but Bando's text makes it clear that the reality was that of smaller groups spread over greater distances engaged in multiple hit-and-run (generally) battles with both first and second-rate German troops.  Few sources (one exception being It Never Snows In September by Robert Kershaw) make this clear.  Second, although the Battle of the Bulge is certainly one of the most recognized military actions of the US armed forces, and many know that the 101st Airborne Division played a crucial role, it is unlikely that many understand what the siege on Bastogne really represented in terms of combat.  Contrary to \\"popular\\" depictions, the month long fierce battles around town of Bastogne were not simply one battle a la the Alamo.  Certainly Bastogne was surrounded by the Germans and siege set, but many small Belgian towns like Foy, Bizory, Marvie, Longvilly, and Noville that were situated around Bastogne played a role in its defense and ultimate reversal of battle.  It is important to remember not just those who fought from within Bastogne proper, but also those who battled from a distance of yards to a few miles outside Bastogne itself.  It was this collective group that earned the Distinguished Unit Citation en masse for their key role in theBattle of the Bulge.  Bando dedicates a large portion of his text to these lesser known but not lesser important engagements.<br />I found Vanguard of the Crusade to be an extremely pleasurable read.  I would sit with maps of the various engagements (all the maps presented in the book can be downloaded and printed from: [...] plot the actions while I moved through the text, and get lost in the hundreds of photographs presented that put a real face on the map coordinates and words.  While it is not essential to read Vanguard in this fashion I suggest it, as it is rare that one can so lose oneself so fully in a popular historical text.

Based mainly upon interviews with veterans of the 82nd Airborne Division (most specifically members of the 505th PIR), Ruggero has crafted a real page turner that takes the reader from the initial theoretical ideals of American Airborne forces to the first major combat - the Sicilian invasion of 1943 - seen by the fruits of the imaginative \\"fathers of the Airborne\\".  Particularly interesting is the description of how initial concepts of the US Airborne Army were brought to fruition, and how a young West Point Captain, James (\\"Slim Jim\\") M. Gavin, played into these early events.  Gavin is of course central to the entire story of the 82nd as he was a company commander in the 503rd PIR (Parachute Infantry Regiment) during training at Fort Benning, later regimental commander of the 505th PIR on its jump into Sicily and combat through Italy, and finally division commander of the 82nd Airborne (promoted to this post in August '44).  While initially not of rank and stature to play a significant role in pushing the Airborne concept into reality, \\"Slim Jim\\" was certainly a major player in keeping the Airborne on the map - this is exemplified by his leadership of the 505th in the Sicilian campaign, which is so eloquently relayed here in \\"Combat Jump\\".  It is the strong and steadfast picture of Gavin as a commander leading from the front that comes shinning through in \\"Combat Jump\\".  It is no wonder that the US Airborne Army succeeded (in spite of many perceived tactical failures and let downs) with man like Gavin at the helm!  Ruggero should be commended for bringing to life again the larger than life character that was Jim Gavin.<br />From the standpoint of precision of presented historical facts \\"Combat Jump\\" suffers in a fashion not uncommon in similarly presented second-hand \\"oral histories\\", such as works by Stephen Ambrose.  Mr. Ruggero has no doubt taken the relayed oral histories of veterans at face value (in fact Ruggero essentially conveys this message in the last paragraph of his Author's Note at the end of the book) as historical inconsistencies are present in the text.  One glaring example is the common reference to battles with numerous Tiger tanks during the first 3-4 days of battle in Sicily.  No doubt lightly-armed paratroopers fighting as essentially as foot infantry without support of mechanized forces and little by way of supporting artillery would \\"see\\" any German tanks as the dreaded Tigers.  In reality just 17 Tiger 1 tanks were actually present on Sicily at the time of the invasion on July 10, 1943, and were essentially rendered non-combatant by pressing US Naval Gunfire.  Moreover, by D-Day+3 ten of these tanks were destroyed by the Germans themselves to avoid their capture (six of the remaining seven met a similar fate in the days that followed).  It therefore seems almost certain that many of the \\"Tigers\\" fought by the 82nd on Sicily were in fact Mark IV or Panther tanks.  This in no way diminishes the valor and bravery of the paratroopers who took on multi-ton armored vehicles, often with little more than adrenalin and a carbine, it merely points out that soldiers fighting in the field seldom see the events historically, but rather from the real perspective of life or death.  To the trooper in the field any tank might as well be a Tiger when he was exposed without shelter and on his own.  Neither Ruggero nor the veterans relaying their experiences can be particularly faulted for such errors.  It is only pointed out here to illustrate the point from a \\"purity of history\\" vantage point.<br />Despite errors in precision of historical facts, \\"Combat Jump\\" is a wonderful read and worthy of attention as a tribute to the men who fought with the US Airborne, not just those of the 82nd Sicilian campaign.

US	44851296	R411IASBUHARA	0060009764	571997989	The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II	Books	4	56	70	N	N	Blitz or myth: Who spins the best story?	Let me state right up front that an interesting thesis, if written well, can still make one think about the subject matter, even if researched poorly or selectively.  This fact played heavily in my final analysis and rating of John Mosier's \\"The Blitzkrieg Myth: How Hitler and the Allies Misread the Strategic Realities of World War II\\".  Now for the breakdown:<br />First, this is an easy book to read and one can get through it pretty quick.  In addition, it is one that, while not impossible to put down, I was compelled to read a bit more even late at night when my eyelids were getting heavy. As a literary piece this is a solid read - even if Mosier has a proclivity for semicolons!<br />Second, Mosier's thesis that \\"breakthroughs\\" with armor and airpower, as he re-termed tank Blitzkrieg and strategic bombing tactics together, were in fact products of historical imagination for the most part and not really practical outcomes of WWII is an interesting one - or at least the portion revolving around armored thrusts.  The failure of strategic bombing has been acknowledged for years by historians both connected with and independent from the Armies that battled.  Thus this portion of his thesis is accepted and need not be argued and re-proven.  The former portion, that armored breakthroughs did not actually swing the balance of the war is a more interesting one that probably deserves some critical analysis.  The problem here is that Mosier falls into the very trap that he claims post-war analysts and historians have fallen into - chosing events and situations that tend to provide support for the idea being proposed and spinning the history according to thesis.  Mosier argues that disciples of Fuller (let's limit our discussion to tanks and armor as airpower failures are already accepted) spun the war to fit the theory of breakthroughs such that breakthroughs were the resultant history. One has to agree that their appears to be some truth in this. Certainly tanks alone were not decisive in determining the outcome of the war, and what appeared temporally and spatially as breakthoughs on the battlefield were influenced as much by political situations and non-armor Blitz military tactics as motorized tactics implicite in Fuller's ideas.  Yet tanks and armor were important factors in there own right - the most important case in point being the Eastern front.  Mosier tells the reader that the T34 Russian battletank was the BEST tank of the war - a point generally agreed upon by decades of historians - yet he omits essentially all reference to brilliant Russian tactic use of this tank on the Eastern front. Rather he limits his discussion to Poland, France, brief synopsis of desert battles, and post-Allied invasion western Europe.  In doing so he avoids clear examples of dramatic armored breakthroughs that occurred during the march to Berlin by the Russians. Also by minimizing the discussion of the desert war Mosier again avoids discussion of what was in most cases mobile tank battles alternating with attemps of armor and infantry to breakthough defensive stances.  By picking and chosing examples where the breakthrough theory is not the clear and sole determinant of the battle outcome Mosier provides support for his thesis.  Is this not in all intent and purpose what Mosier said the Blitz proponents have done for decades?<br />So what is the correct spin?  Was the Blitz a real tactical product or theoritical dream?  As most things in life go it is probably fair to say \\"a little of both, depending upon where you look\\".  If one takes isolated examples, as both Mosier and those he criticizes have done the extreme viewpoints win out.  But what's the real answer?  Here's how this book get's 4 stars instead of 2 - the answer is still out there waiting for an unbiased thorough study, taking into account all of the available historical data but using Mosier's criteria for whether or not a breakthrough theory is applicable.  This means looking more boradly at the war as a whole - the entire European and Middle Eastern theatres, and addressing not pierced defensive weaknesses, as Mosier is correct to point out have generally been done previously, but to look at both defensive and offensive realities of both combatants.  Thus, the interesting thesis still exists I think and for that reason my interest in the question is still high and I can give \\"The Blitzkrieg Myth\\" four stars for making me think.<br />Disclaimer: serious students of history should be aware before they read this book that a lot of historical fact is omitted or shoved aside in the \\"testing\\" of the thesis.radly at the war as a whole - the entire European and Middle Eastern theatres, and addressing not pierced defensive weaknesses, as Mosier is correct to point out have generally been done previously, but to look at both defensive and offensive realities of both combatants.

Sydnor Jr's, \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\" is a wonderful piece of historical literature.  This book represents Dr. Sydnor's Ph.D. dissertation and as such is based on significant research - this is historical prose by a historian!  However, having said that, this does not imply that \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\" is merely an academic book with facts that is dry to read, quite the opposite.  \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\" is a pleasure to read - well-crafted prose and flow - and contains lots of facts.  This dissertation is not meant to represent a study of the whole Waffen SS, but rather an in depth look at one component - Third SS Panzer Division Totenkopf (Totenkopfdivision) - as an individual and somewhat isolated case.  That said, it is fair to say that whether you are an airchair historian looking for a good read or a serious student of history interested in the Waffen SS and issues associated with the fighting arm of the SS, \\"Soldiers of Destruction\\" might be what you're looking for.<br />Dr. Syndor begins his story with a discussion of the development of the Totenkpfdivision as an outgrowth from the SS Totenkopfverbande (Deaths Head Division) and the concentration camp guard system.  Central to this development was Theodor Eicke, who put his aggressive, fanatical NSADP stamp on the system.  He organized the concentration camp guard system and from that the initial Totenkopfdivision, making this Waffen SS unit one with a particularly rabid Nazi makeup, at least at its inception.  By bringing the formation of the Totenkopfdivision into focus provides important perspective for Syndor and the reader to assess the actions of the division in its military exploits, including charges of brutality.  Simply put, are actions seemingly askew from other battle units, such as murder of POWs, ultimately unexpected given the personalities and ideological \\"training\\" of the division?  Syndor does not use this analysis to excuse the actions but rather to provide clarity for greater understanding in a historical context.<br />The passages dealing with combat of the Totenkopfdivision (most of which occurred against the Soviets) are fascinating and highly enlightening.  Syndor has does a great job brining to life these years of the division and balancing the highly effective and laudable (from a military perspective) battle actions of the Totenkpdivision with the criminal activities that followed the division.  The reader can easily separate these issues and then place the latter in context given the introductory material.  This is in fact what Syndor attempts to do (quite effectively I believe) in the last section of the book, entitled: Ideology, Personality, Criminality.<br />In the end this is a wonderful book, both from a mere historical and a reading enjoyment standpoint.  Syndor conveys a clear history of a single element of the Waffen SS that is both significant and fair.  Highly recommended reading - five stars!eater understanding in a historical context.<br />The passages dealing with combat of the Totenkopfdivision (most of which occurred against the Soviets) are fascinating and highly enlightening.

This book chronicles a number of events associated with the Nazi attempts to exterminate the entire Jewish people from the globe. Certainly any story of the Holocaust is disturbing to a rational person but \\"The Good Old Days\\" presents these events through the words/tales of people who were there - soldiers, killers, non-Jewish citizenry.  Most of the events described are related through several people (making the reading a bit tedious) and in all cases the stories, while slightly different in detail - and almost always apologetic when told after the passage of time - would make my stomach wrench at how indifferently the waste of human life was taken.  This is especially true in cases where stories are supported by diaries written at the time of the events.  It is a oft used generalization that the Germans are a people of exactness and precision.  This has never been more true than in assiocation with the Holocaust.  The SS and its minions went about their gruesome business with the efficiency stereotypically expected of the Germans - they kept exacting notes, approached it impassively as to not become emotionally attached to the situation (or they were removed from the situation - generally voluntarily, or so it is claimed), and strove to generate more efficient, quick and \\"humane\\" ways to dispose of those felt inferior.  The passages in this book are presented without any candy coating and thus this text is not for the faint of heart.  Yet in doing so the reader is truly left with a feeling of collective human guilt that any culture could perpetrate such acts and in such a detacted fashion.  To say that no one in Germany cared about what was happening is unfair, yet it is fair from this text and others on the subject that many were active participants and while some revelled in the experience - which is disturbing enough - most acted as murderers out of duty to service, comrades, Fatherland, and/or their Fuhrer - and this is a TRULY DISTURBING thought.  How far mankind is capable of sinking.<br />This is a solid 4 star effort.  It is only the repetitive nature of the text that keeps it from being a 5 star book.  Having said this, it is clear why the editors chose to present each story multiple times from several sources: for impact by showing that these were not simply acts of a few that no one knew about or that were ebing acting fought against - in short to show the impassive brutality and collusion of cause.  \\"The Good Old Days\\" is recommended reading for anyone trying to understand the Holocaust and how such an event so pivotal in the history of man could have happened.

Bierman and Smith have collaborated to produce a lucid and riveting tale of what has often been called the turning point of WWII for the Western combatants.  Whether this belief is strictly true or not, it is clear that the German Army, in this case represented by the Afrika Corps (and its Italian ally), went from a victorious and seemingly unbeatable army to a broken, to a retreating and utterly spent group of soldiers discarded by their leader.<br />The Battle of Alamein is more than a story of the major engagements so well known and oft told, it is also a story of little known elements that played important, if somewhat side-stage, roles in this first major tactical victory for the British Army (represented by the 8th Army in this case).  It is in fact this component of the book that makes it most compelling.  Bierman and Smith tell, with considerable literary style, of how the British Long Range Desert Group, founded and initially lead by the 30's desert adventurer Ralph Bagnold, went through several incarnations which ultimately developed many of the most important desert warfare tactics used by the 8th in its victory over Rommel.  The reader also learns about a behind the lines sabotage group formed from German Jews that caused considerable havoc to the German forces, despite considerable loss to their own little band.  But the victors are not solely presented.  The reader is taken down an equal number of paths that explain both well and lesser known exploits of the Afrika Corps and the Italian Desert Army.<br />As a chronicle of the combat itself The Battle of Alamein quite often falls short.  There are a number of errors and misstatements but the background and sidestories larger make up for this deficiency.  Thi is a work crafted in a way amateur historians can enjoy and have their interest piqued - professional or more serious amateurs should approach it open minded and willing to accept some &quot;issues&quot;.  If the reader wants a great one-two punch try Rick Atkinson's Army at Dawn in combination with The Battle of Alamein.  The former is a 5 star effort of serious historical value and literary flair, while The Battle of Alamein, while flawed, delivers a sound and fun 4 star read.und and sidestories larger make up for this deficiency.

Black Edelweiss is a rare example of a personal WWII memoir written soon after the events (most of the draft was written while the author was a POW during 1945-46) with the emotional and historical breadth of a book written from a much greater distance of time and utilizing a variety of non-personal references.  Johann Voss (a pseudonym) has put his life in the SS-Mountain Infantry Regiment 11 (given the name Reinhard Heydrich in 1942) to paper in a way that the reader can truly assess the actions of a single soldier, his immediate platoon members and larger Regimental force rationally without the baggage of bias.  This is not to say that the author has created a typical post-war apologetic piece that draws empathy/sympathy from the reader.  Rather, Voss draws the reader along in an honest forthright story of his experiences as a loyal soldier within a larger group of comrades who, although fighting for the Hitler regime, did so with heart and passion for comrades, unit and country, but with clear chivalry (or at least as much as can fairly be expected in war) and battle fairness.  It is the very nature of when this book was drafted (and little changed by the author later although published 60 odd years after being drafted)  while the author was still feeling connection to and pride of unit  that makes this NOT a typical Nazi apologia book.  The book was however written at a time when the author was learning (second hand) about the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the SS structure more particularly, and as such the author is able to place his military experiences in perspective of the regime he served.  This creates both an honest look at combat and the emotions invoked upon finding for what and whom he and friends served and died for.  Emotion is raw and real in this book.<br />Voss starts and ends the book in third person from the POW pen, but in between weaves an engrossing story of how a young impressionable German is compelled to join an elite SS-Mountain Regiment; how this decision positively affects his life; how he survives the cold and combat of service above the Artic circle, in the Vosges Mountains, and the last days of the western Reich frontier; and how his earlier decision to join this elite group of men affected his life upon realization that his combat unit has been wholesale lumped with the SS of the Endl&ouml;sung.  The stories of regiment combat are visceral in content and quite rewarding. One can feel the cold, stress, fear and adrenalin of the situations.<br />I highly recommend this book if you want a clear and apparently unembellished, time-unbiased picture of a German combat unit in action.  If you want to double your pleasure read Black Edelweiss back-to-back with another Aberjona Press production, Seven Days in January by Wolf Zoepf.  This latter book deals exclusively with the SS Nord Division and its combat both above the Artic Circle and the Lower Vosges and is pitched more from the pure combat history perspective.ountain Regiment; how this decision positively affects his life; how he survives the cold and combat of service above the Artic circle, in the Vosges Mountains, and the last days of the western Reich frontier; and how his earlier decision to join this elite group of men affected his life upon realization that his combat unit has been wholesale lumped with the SS of the Endlösung.

As an amateur student of WWII history I have tried hard to understand more about how the major \\"players\\" came to be, thought, and operated before, during, and after (when applicable) the war.  John Toland's biography of Hitler is an amazing piece of historical literature!! If you've ever read any of Toland's books (I've read \\"Battle: The Story of the Bulge\\" and \\"The Last 100 Days\\" - both excellent) you know he can convey a story that makes the words feel alive.  He does that here equally as well in a 900 page masterpiece.  He starts with a historical background of the Hitler lineage (and possible Jewish blood!) and ends in with various Nazi elites and their capture, deaths, etc after the fall of Berlin and Hitler's suicide.  In between we get a marvelous picture of a child Adolf - his closeness to his mother and estrangement from his father; a young man searching for his place - time spent in Vienna flop houses struggling to survive, failing to acheive and finding his place in the political upheaval leading to the Great War; his time at the front - from runner to gassed Iron cross winner; his \\"Time of Struggle\\" in forming the NADSP and leading a failed putsch, prison, and release to a country ready to embrace him; to his rise to Chancellor, dictator, statesman, warlord, self-proclaimed Christ, mass murderer; to a broken, pre-aged, sickly man how ultimately takes his own life to avoid paying the butchers bill.  Toland weaves a story that is both easy to read and historically engaging.  I learned a lot and had fun doing it - just the way I love history!!!<br />Highly recommended.	2004-02-29

I have read three of his books on WWII and each is a masterpiece in its own right.  \\"The Last 100 Days\\" is a perfect example.  I couldn't put this book down.  I have little time to read for fun but when I get my hands on a book like this my time flies!!!  \\"The Last 100 Days\\" cover exactly that, from a multitude of perspectives: Soldiers: German, Russian, English, and American; leaders; and civilians.  It's a story that could have only been told this way by someone with Toland's talents.  His words always seem to come alive and \\"100 Days\\" is not different from other works of his I have read (\\"Battle\\" and \\"Adolf Hitler\\").  Despite the fact that I am pretty versed with WWII and the end of the ETO,fall of Berlin, etc., I was on the edge of my seat reading this book.  It wasn't so much from new content but just in the way Toland tells the story.  I highly recommend this book to both beginners and seasoned buffs alike.  Its wonderful reading!!!	2004-02-29

This is it!!!	&quot;A World At Arms&quot; is quite frankly one of the best books on WWII I have ever read (I've read few).  This is one packed book.  Weinberg covers the events leading up to the war, as well as the events themselves.  Although 1300ish pages in length it reads like a 250 page books that fills your soul with facts!  You'll get the how's, who's, where's, and why's - even if you already know the when's and what's they're there also.  Truly a &quot;world&quot; perspective, Weinberg includes it all.  It really is hard to now imagine how much this book covered and how easily it does it.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Yet, block some time, even though it's an easy read it is more than half the length of &quot;War and Peace&quot; so it takes time - but time well spent.	2004-02-29

This IS IT!!	Rick Atkinson's \\"Army At Dawn\\" is a fabulous book!!! 5 stars - two thumbs up - a big hurrah.  The only real problem that arises upon reading this book is: when do Volumes II and III of the \\"Liberation Trilogy\\" come out?<br />\\"Army At Dawn\\" is very pleasant reading.  Enjoyable, enjoyable, enjoyable!  Want facts?  \\"Army At Dawn\\" has it.  From the Allied perspective, this book would go nicely as a double read with Orr Kelly's \\"Meeting The Fox\\".  Where \\"Meeting The Fox\\" is essentially limited to the US Army's role in Operation Torch and North African campaigns prior to the fall of Tunis, \\"Army At Dawn\\" deals more broadly with the Allied Expeditionary Force as a whole, its leaders, its interactions with the natives and French colonists/army/navy from the inception of Torch through the fall of the North African theatre as a whole.  Kelly's book is great in its own right but I think \\"Army At Dawn\\" far surpasses \\"Meeting The Fox\\" on shear volume of information.  Both are extremely well written and easy to read.  \\"Army At Dawn\\" covers nearly all the topics covered in \\"Meeting The Fox\\" but battles are not described in the same detail - to allow a broad stroke to be taken relative to the entire theatre of operations.  So together these two books deal quite thoroughly with the North African theatre from an Allied point of view.  \\"Army At Dawn\\" also contains insights from the Axis perspective, although the story is generally told from the Victor rather than Vanquished perspective.  If a reader want to see how the other side saw the African theatre they should couple \\"Army\\" and \\"Meeting\\" with \\"The Rommel Papers\\" - a well written and lucid account of the Afrika Corps as told by The Dessert Fox himself.<br />If you want to read a gripping tale of the initial turn of the war to the Western Allies side, and you want personalities, battles, emotion and all the things that surrounded the North African campaigns, \\"Army At Dawn\\" is the book for you.  I've been lucky enough to stay clear of too many \\"dogs\\" in my WWII reading (so most of my reviews are fairly positive) but only a few books really stand out at 5 star gems - \\"Army At Dawn\\" is one such book.of too many \\"dogs\\" in my WWII reading (so most of my reviews are fairly positive) but only a few books really stand out at 5 star gems - \\"Army At Dawn\\" is one such book.	2003-05-01

Ryan's \\"A Bridge Too Far\\", it is a wonderful complement and serious study.  Kershaw's book details the Battle for Arnhem and associated actions of the Allies Operation Market-Garden from the German perspective.  As such this book is in many way the mirror image of Ryan's book, told from the Allied side of the fence.  Where \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" is wonderful literature on its own right, independent of its value as a historical work, \\"It Never Snows\\" is a more difficult read from a pure reading pleasure standpoint but is a WONDERFUL historical treatise.  Kershaw uses both historical documents and first hand accounts from interviews of surviving German soldiers to weave an intricate story of the German's surprise to Market and subsequent response to Market and Garden that ultimately stop dead the push Monty thought could go all the way to the Ruhr and beyond to Berlin.  While there are no real surprises in terms of the battle perspectives themselves the vantage point provided from looking back at the Allies rather than the traditional way (we Americans) look out at the Axis armies is very refreshing.  Another aspect of \\"It Never Snows\\" that makes it a really nice piece of work is its thorough documentation of the 2nd SS Panzer Corps' role that was critical to the German blunting of Market-Garden.  \\"It Never Snows\\" is possible one of the most thorough studies of the 2nd SS (aside from Michael Reynold's \\"Sons of the Reich\\") out there that is also enjoyable to read.<br />Certainly \\"It Never Snows In September\\" is not written a la Ryan or Ambrose - so if you need your history slick and stylish this is probably not for you - but it is readable and fun to read.  Kershaw is a military man by training not a writer like Ryan or Ambrose and given that fact \\"It Never Snows\\" is actually a quite good read.  It's not simple a dry treatise of facts, there is heart and sole.  If you want to know more about Market-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, and want to have fun learning about it, I suggest combining \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" and \\"It Never Snows in September\\" as a tag-team.  These two books alone will give you your fix and them some.  \\"It Never Snows\\" is currently out of print and getting a copy will cost you (unless you can find one in a library somewhere) but it's worth every cent!!!-Garden and the Battle of Arnhem, and want to have fun learning about it, I suggest combining \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" and \\"It Never Snows in September\\" as a tag-team.

The reader decides	Joachim Fest's \\"Speer: The Final Verdict\\" is a solid contribution to the Speer catalog.  Fest's book is essentially a biography of Speer's time within the National Socialist regime.  It is a nice (if somewhat redundant) companion to Speer's pseudo-autobiography \\"Inside the Third Reich\\".  Whereas Speer's writings in ItTR focus not only on his time in the Nazi regime but also childhood and university years, Fest's book really deals with Speer's rise in the Nazi power structure and his association (often volatile but never strained beyond distinct affection) with Hitler.  While the title suggests that the reader will gain some new insight into Speer's complicity and complacency relative to war crimes for which had association, little new is brought to life.  Yet, because Fest is looking from outside - he is not writing about himself as Speer has done - the analysis can be taken with a different grain of spice.  Fest does not excuse Speer's actions but rather tries to place them in a context that the reader can draw judgment from.<br />It is clear that Speer is an enigma within the third Reich: 1) he was highly educated (if not successful as an architect before his association with the Nazi's) and cultured - in stark contrast to other power brokers like Rohm and Bormann; 2) while certainly not immune to Hitler's psychological powers Speer did actively disobey (at great personal risk) many of Hitler's orders late in the war - with the major exception of the assassination plot conspirators Speer is essentially alone in this regard, and 3) while he appears to have despised politics he played the intrigue game within the Hitlter Court to perfection and really had few rivals (Bormann being the strongest).  Was he the \\"Good Nazi\\"?  Or is this simply an oxymoron?  Either way, Fest's book provides ample information to let the reader decide the historical fate of Albert Speer.  With Speer's own writings he attempts to paint a fairly pretty picture of his National Socialist life.  Unlike other works that try hard to project conclusions about Speer's culpability and motivations, Fest's work presents facts with little interpretation - that remains the responsibility of the reader.e.

Padfield certainly makes no apologies for Himmler, yet he presents a balanced account of how Himmler might have come to the point of cold blooded extermination he was at in 1941-44 and then his \\"change of heart\\" at the end.<br />Padfield spends much of the early part of the book delving into Himmler's childhood, upbringing (by a strick disciplinarian professor father, and soft mother), early adult years and his time during the \\"day's of struggle\\" - the early Nazi years.  This introduction does a lot to set the scence for Himmler's life.  While we certainly can't forgive the man for hwat he did and stood for, we might be able to understand more clearly the mind set behind the decisions he made.  Padfield's research paints Himmler as a man who was deeply scared by his upbringing and retreated into a fantasy world which he went deeper into as time went on.  When he eventually gained respect and power as one of the Nazi elite he expressed his fantasy world overtly to the world.<br />Himmler's years in power in Nazi Germany are well documented, yet Padfield does a great job showing not just what Himmler ddid but how he did it - from establishment of the SS and Gestapo to the Holocaust.  Himmler didn't do it on his own - again Padfield is carfule not to excuse him or even take blame from him, but rather to show how Himmler created a system within tthe Nazi power structure that allowed him to orchestrate such attrocities on man kind. He was a consumate suck up to others in power - keeping with him his whole life his feelings of insecurity and uselessness, even at the height of his power.<br />All in all, \\"Himmler\\" is a must read for those interested in understanding the how's of WWII's crimes and how a single human can, with the aide of others, so change history.	2002-11-19

John Keegan's \\"The Second World War\\" is a masterfully written dissertation of WWII.  While Keegan certainly doesn't cover every aspect of the war - he in fact explains that he will not attempt to do this in his Prologue - he does do an admirable job presenting the War contextually for readers.  His separation of the War into blocks of time and space is especially critical in making this an encompassing book.  Also Keegan places significance on the why's of the War - why would Germany go to war?  Why did the US resist coming into the war?  Why did Japan act differently than germany to it's occupied peoples?  All of these questions place the battle in perspective.  The battles - Keegan deals with the major ones brilliantly.  I have read many WWII books but I have to say that I still learned a lot from Keegan's book - both new things and tweekings of things already learned.<br />\\"The Second World War\\" is certainly now part of my Must Read collection.

Wolf Zoepf's \\"Seven Days in January\\" is a solid piece of work documenting the 6th SS Mountain Divison.  The title is however a little misleading as at least 1/3 of the book deals with the trials and tribulations of the early 6th Mountain in it's time above the Artic circle in Norway.  While this is an interesting history on it's own I was disappointed to have to read so much background that ultimately didn't frame the Nordwind battle any clearer.  Having stated this caveat, Zoepf's discussion of the Operation Nordwind was however fascinating and enlightening.  Clearly the 6th was an elite force that was sacrificed at the alter of battle at the end of the Ardennes Offensive.<br />Aside from the slightly dull and unnecessary introductory portions cited above this is a solid 4 star book, with the intro it slips to a decent 3 star book.  Probably not worth full new book price.<br />UPDATE (March 12, 2004): Upon reading another Aberjona Press book, Black Edelweiss by Johann Voss, I feel it is necessary to modify my original review of Seven Days in January.  While I stand by each of my original comments I would add that if read together with Black Edelweiss - a wonderful combat memoir from a veteran of SS-Mountain Regiment 11 - Seven Days in January is a truly great book in total, including the first third of the book that I said seemed out of place.  Black Edelweiss expands upon these passages about the Artic Circle combat and also deals with the battles of the Lower Vosges that Seven Days is mainly meant to convey.  In this larger context Seven Days in January is a solid 4 star book -worth market value (granted you need to purchase two solid reads!)	2002-11-19

Aside from \\"The Rommel Papers\\" (E. Rommel/B.H. Liddell) this book is the only book singly dedicated to battles of the North African theatre that I have read so my review may be limited from a comparative standpoint. Yet with a fairly decent number of books on WWII under my belt I can easily state that \\"Meeting the Fox\\" was one of the most enjoyable I've read. It's a great complement to \\"The Rommel Papers\\" in that it is dedicated to the North African theatre after entrance of the US Army with Operation Torch - the first grand scale allied amphibious landing. \\"The Rommel Papers\\" deals more inclusively with the entire North African campaign, and not surprisingly from the German perspective. \\"Meeting the Fox\\" is really dedicated to examining the US Army's \\"trial by fire and blood\\" (as it was) upon it's first (disastrous) meeting with the German/Italian armies. Kelly paints a nice picture of how the US Army that landed in North Africa changed from a green, poorly trained and often poorly lead force in nine short months to one more familiar to most Americans that fought and won in Northern Europe a year later. Kelly is certainly critical of problems that arose in the early battles, but he is also fair. While others have lain certain and almost singular blame for early failures on Maj. Gen. Fredendall, the highest-ranking field commander during the first bloody loses, Kelly is quick to point out that Fredendall was not the only \\"incompetent\\". Moreover, Kelly gives credit to commanders who have shared blame but probably didn't deserve it, such as Combat Command B commander Brig. Gen. Robinett and Ranger leader Maj. Darby. Fortunately for many of those involved in early defeats that were not removed from command, they learned from the experiences and went on to brilliant successes, such as Darby.<br />\\"Meeting the Fox\\" is a well written, easy to read book. There is ample hard information and facts for the serious student and enough literary flare and style for the more casual WWII reader. All in all this book belongs on my Classics shelf and I recommend it highly!h literary flare and style for the more casual WWII reader.

Part of this is its length, part is it's \\"Hollywood\\" style. Unfortunately much of the book is actually dedicated not to Blunt's fighting actions and heroism, but to his personal search for war mementos. According to Mr. Blunt himself he spent considerable time both while in the line and in transit to the line and other destinations looking for war relics to send/take home. These personal revelations became old after a while and left me feeling that the battle passages might be a bit embellished. Yet I will take them at face value as he was there and I was not. However, I was ... a bit surprised that Blunt only mentions a couple of fellow GI's by name (one is a fellow musician from the occupation days). Yet given the apparent amount of time Blunt spent on his own in search of treasure it may not be too surprising that he failed to forge many tight bonds with other GIs. Despite all these negatives, I give a lot of credit to Blunt for, first being there and sacrificing for his country and freedom, and second sharing war in its un-diluted form. His commentary on the atrocities he saw as well as everyday death and destruction of battle was refreshing, if disturbing. Maybe that's what we need more of - disturbing pictures of war. They might help to keep us from fighting more wars. All in all 3.5 stars.	2002-09-03

This book is a compilation of essays Blumenson has written over a nearly 50 year period, most of which have been published before elsewhere (although not together). Blumenson's style is pretty good and he weaves a nice story, however he appears (from this book and the titles of his other books) to be very focused on limited topics of WWII. Now don't misread this comment, this is not all bad. Blumenson is certainly one of the world's expert biographers of G. Patton. But having said that much of \\"Heroes\\" is redundantly dedicated to Blumenson's personal favorites. When I say redundant here, this also should not be misunderstood - I do MEAN REDUNDANT! Redundant to the level of self-plagiarism. I read many passages, almost verbatim, at least three times sometimes more. Several chapters are dedicated to Patton but after the first two you read the rest provide little new, although 30-40 years separate the publishing of some. I can however say that despite the redundant nature of \\"Heroes\\" that there was enough \\"new\\" material here for me to walk away satisfied. Most of my WWII reads are centered between Berlin and the Channel and the Channel and Berlin, with a few stops in northern Africa. I had previously read little about the Italian campaigns, and this seems to be one of Blumenson's favored topics. Thus I was treated to ample new material (although again in a redundant fashion).<br />I gave \\"Heroes Never Die\\" three stars here but if it were slightly (even a few of the 40 plus chapters) less redundant in content it would have gotten 4. It's a solid, easily read book that I did enjoy. A bit pricey as a new book but certainly worth a used cost. If you're new to the genre this is a worthy book, even at full price.	2002-08-16

Army from the Normandy Beaches to the Bulge to the Surrender of Germany	Books	5	4	6	N	N	Everyday Joe's become America's GI heros	My father-in-law gave me this book on one of his visits a couple years ago and it sit for a few months before I started reading it. Yet, once started I really had a hard time putting it down. It had been years since I read a WWII history book and \\"Citizen Soldiers\\" rejuvenated my passion for the genre. Like him or hate him, it's hard to argue that Stephen Ambrose does not have a way to enthrall a reader with the topic. Ambrose is certainly one of my favorite authors from the standpoint of easy reading. He writes with a clarity that is lost in more amateur (if actually vets of the war) authors in the genre. As such he's able to take the reader through the entire ETO portion of the war in 400ish pages and highlight most of the significant major battles and intrigues. Moreover, he does this through third-person narratives gathered from countless hours of discussions with vets. Ambrose has become one of the strongest proponents of keeping our proud WWII history alive and with books like Citizen Soldiers he pays serious tribute to those who gave so much for so many. Although I think this book is a must for all those who already love military history, I think it is especially perfect for those who have only a passing interest but want to know more without having to read Churchill's 6 Vol. masterpiece. Citizen Soldiers is high tribute to those who fought and solid reading for those who have benefited in our democratic society after their sacrifices.	2002-08-09

As I read this book about a year and a half ago (it was winter) I could literally sense all the emotions Toland conveyed to paper. His style is wonderful and despite the fact that this book was first published in the 50's, he uses the third-person narrative (told from the GI's who were actually there) - something quite fashionable in recent years - to tell much of the story. Using these stories Toland weaves a wonderful tapestry that has more than expected texture for a literary source of this genre. I found his style exceedingly easy to read and hard to put down. \\"Battle\\", while not as steeped in cold hard battle-field fact and numbers as other Bulge books, is a much better read with ample facts and told by survivors not simply a repackaging of after-reports by a historian-writer. I can't recommend this book highly enough!	2002-08-09

Other reviews have stated that Whiting provides no real insight as to why this happened, and in the end analysis there is some truth in that - many of the facts surrounding this huge intelligence faux pas remain obscured and possibly lost forever to time. However, in contrast to some other reviews I found Whiting's explanations of the events quite compelling and enlightening. Granted no single fault was found with Allied intelligence to place blame on, but that was why the Bulge occurred - no single event, but rather a series of events lead up to the Ardennes offensive and the German surprise. Whiting in my opinion does a decent job introducing many of the significant intelligence characters of the period, both Allied and Nazi. I found the stories of the German counter-intelligence ploys most interesting and enlightening, as these are sides of the story not often told. While there is certainly enough new material here to keep one interested I tend to agree with previous reviews that Whiting's style is a bit difficult at first, but I got used to it. I read the book over a three-day period (mainly while traveling for a business trip) and can say that in the end I really enjoyed the book. Yet, it's shortness (~160 pages) made it not quite worth full market price when all the criticisms discussed above are taken into account. I would however not dissuade readers from taking a look at other works by Whiting.	2002-07-13

I should not have been surprised that I found the book even more compelling than the movie (which BTW was very well done!).<br />Albert Speer was one of the small group of Hitler's paladins who was present from his early days until the end. With a seemingly average architectural career in front of him a young Speer is captivated by the Fuhrer during the early \\"days of struggle\\" (of the Nazi party) after Hitler's release from Landsberg prison. His awe of Hitler as a speaker and magnetic personality, and Hitler's longing to be an \\"artist\\" brought the two together and a mutual respect and friendship grew from these likes. According to Speer's accounts his only real contact with Hitler on a professional level in the early years (even through the first years of the war) was related to architecture. Speer was commissioned for several party and later state projects - this despite Prof.Todt and his organization being the chosen \\"party\\" architects. When Todt was killed in a plane crash, Speer filled the void. He and Hitler planned to rebuild Berlin (as Germania) as the seat of power in all of Europe (and the world?) in grand fashion. Many of Hitler's own personal drawings for structures, such as a great arch to dwarf the Arch de Truimphe, survived the war in Speer's possession and are presented in the book. These tidbits of \\"artisan\\" sidelines are a fascinating piece of history not found elsewhere. One sees another side of Adolf Hitler - one that however still retains his now expected megalomania. As the war progressed and Speer's connections with Hitler were strengthened he attained greater stature and eventually became the Minister of Armaments. In this capacity Speer really found his calling. Many books have touched on the genius that was Speer's in terms of war production. Under Speer's reign, despite the western allies and Russian's closing in from either side and continual air bombardment, war production continued to increase right up to the last couple of months of the war. This is an amazing testament to Speer and his thoroughly Germanic approach to production. It however required slave labor on the backs of hundreds of thousands from the \\"Minderwertigen\\" (inferior races), which the Nazi movement looked to erase (and tried very hard to do) from existence. While Speer is one of the few Nazi's who stated that ALL Germans were responsible for the war and it's atrocities - he has often been called the \\"Good Nazi\\" (sarcastically) for his statements - he does not really ooze remorse for his slave labor program, which kept the war moving and continued to cause the deaths of so many. He does however make a strong point in these memoirs to give the reader the clear impression that he did everything he could at the end - when he apparently came to his better senses - to end the war and its associated suffering. These claims, from most accounts, seem to be merited. Yet many in the Nazi regime had changes of heart as the walls closed in so we should not have expected anything less from someone of Speer's intelligence.<br />All in all this book as a really good read with plenty of material not found elsewhere (unless rehashed from Speer's works themselves) to chew on. Whether Speer was a \\"Good Nazi\\" or not is not a judgment I would make. I do however feel that he left a Good account of the rise and fall of the Nazi movement and provides plenty of insight into the inner workings of Hitler's power elite.

Certainly not his best work (Citizen Soldiers and D-Day are much better), but he does, in my humble (maybe &quot;uneducated&quot;) opinion do the men of E Company, 101st Airborne justice with this snippet of their time spend training, fighting and post war living.  This relatively short (some 300ish pages) book is an easy read that one can get through quickly.  Yet, unlike Citizen Soldier, which I had a hard time putting down, Band of Brothers is easier to walk away from and then come back to - although I must stress that I always came back to it.  Many of the accounts in Band of Brothers are just too brief and leave the reader thirsting for more.  In the end though I was not so much disappointed with the book as I was wishing there had been more to digest and think about.  If this is the first Ambrose book you read, don't be discouraged from reading others of his - he is a great author, Band of Brothers is solid but not his best.	2002-05-07

This book has multiple layers to provide material for a diverse set of readers and students of WWII history.<br />First, \\"Hell\\" is a thoroughly researched study of the battle of the Hurtgen Forest. The first few chapters detail the 4th Infantry Div, 22d Reg in particular and the opposing German LXXIV Corps - their training, makeup and histories leading up to the battle. Approximately the next half of the book goes through the battle in an organized fashion that one can follow the sequence of events on the different fronts. Dr. Rush uses footnotes liberally to support his work and I found this refreshing - details were present but not \\"messing up\\" the flow of the text. Rush (or his editors?) also does something I wish other treatises of this type would do: make clear distinctions between Allied and Axis battle groups in a way a developing student of the field can follow. In \\"Hell\\" Rush does this by italicizing all German units - thus it is clear when he is writing about a German vs an American group.<br />Second, Rush, by detailing a single battle of attrition fought over a limited time span has been able to compare and contrast American and German combat replacement systems and battle effectiveness. Other military historians have previously severely criticized the American troop replacement system of WWII and have proposed that combat effectiveness suffered as a result. Dr. Rush provides ample evidence from his analysis of the Battle of the Hurtgen that this previous thesis is at its heart not accurate. In fact, in this one battle of attrition the American system prevailed and won the battle - and Hurtgen is just one example of this. Thus. \\"Hell\\" is also a wonderful work of new thinking that challenges conventional wisdom.<br />Third, \\"Hell\\" is a wonderfully written work. While it is not as \\"flowery\\" as books by C. Ryan or S. Ambrose, it is clear, concise and well organized. This book was an absolute pleasure to read. Many historical works with this much depth are quite dry and hard reads, not so with \\"Hell\\". Five stars!!!!easure to read.

MacDonald's presentation of the Battle of the Bulge is certainly a thorough journey.  Mr. MacDonald had first hand experience having served in the US Army in the Ardennes, and you feel that in this work.  He should be applauded for his completeness of subject, certainly this work accomplishes that.  From a purely historical perspective this is a great piece of work, yet from the perspective of historical reading for pure pleasure this book fails horribly.  Certainly the book has content but MacDonald has the ability to easily lose the train of thought, moving back and forth between American and German units within one apparent stream of thought, when in reality multiple trains of thought were intended.  In some places (e.g., his discussion of the leaderships and their responses) the book reads extremely well, but in most the task of reading is exactly that - a TASK!  On content I recommend this book, on pleasure I cannot.  While John Toland (&quot;Battle&quot;) gives praise to MacDonald's work as the basis of content, he did not praise it as a &quot;good read&quot; - I see why not.  Trumpet's would be a great read together with Toland's &quot;Battle&quot;; Battle for pleasure, Trumpets for content!	2002-02-13

For those more familiar with WWII history and the great generals, they know a lot of what is general knowledge is hype more than fact. For example, while Field Marshall Erwin Rommel was certainly a brilliant tactician and strategist, he was not - contrary to popular belief - the originator of the Blitz style of armored warfare. Certainly he was one of its most successful practitioners, but not the originator. That credit belongs to English military minds and was put into practice by General Heinz Gurderian (see Panzer Leader by Gurderian). Rommel was a brilliant self-promoter - with humility though. And he was a favored son of Hitler in the beginning, although the \\"father\\" forced him to commit suicide in the end. Rommel did have some amazing victories and equally appalling defeats. All are chronicled in this stirring, well-written pseudo-autobiography. The Rommel Papers was written from Rommels own personal diaries made during his numerous campaigns. He was a voracious writer who sat down on a near daily to preserve the events of the day. Thus we are treated to a wonderful story of the Blitz through western Europe in 1939-40, the swift victories in northern Africa and slow arduous defeats that followed, and finally to Rommel's attempts to stem the Allied tide that was threatening to rush the Western shores of France in 1944. This is a fun and insightful read for anyone who wants to see war from the perspective of the German public's most favored Marshall. Certainly worth the time spent reading it! Highly recommended.	2001-12-30

This book is easy reading and provides a lot of insight into the last month of Adolf Hitler as the leader of the \\"living dead\\" that rarely if ever left their underground lair. All the major personalities of the Fuhrerbunker are dealt with, as well as their ultimate destinies - some escaping, some being captured and spending years in Russian prisons, and yet others - including Hitler and Goebbles - dying at or in the bunker. I found this book extremely thorough (relative to other sources on the subject) and was not disappointed. All in all a good read.	2001-12-28

Ryan has style in the way he weaves a story, especially one as complicated as that of Operation Market Garden. During the first few days of Market and the beginning of Garden the Germans generally believed that the British and Ami's were staging some big rouse - clearly an airborne drop of that size and magnitude could not have been planned by Montgomery, it was too daring, he was known to be (overly) cautious. But it was Monty's baby. It took Monty a lot of maneuvering to convince SHAEF and Eisenhower to make the dash for the Rhine (and Berlin as Monty's true objective). It had panache and daring and if everything that could have gone wrong hadn't it may have just been the end of the war. As it played out it was a huge set back for the Allies, and given the failure to clean up the Germans around Antwerp because troops were diverted to Garden, one could say that Hurtgen and The Bulge were direct fallouts from Market-Garden's failures. Military objectives aside Market-Garden was an amazing testament to the men who fought it, especially those lonely British airborne troops who held out so admirably in Arnhem. Mr. Ryan does their sacrifices justice with this work. A Bridge Too Far is a must read for all serious students of WWII and should be read by anyone interested in great battles.	2001-12-26

Guderian is quite humble in his writing considering he was the primary driving force behind development of Germany's Blitzkreig warfare. Had this been written by a personality such as Montgomery I'm sure the feel would have been much different. His descriptions of campaigns in the west and east are often quite moving, but equally as often dry and matter of fact. His writings are not as \\"moving\\" or personal as those of Rommel (see The Rommel Papers), but they are full of important information and insights. In particular his closing chapter touches nicely on his feelings of the German High Command, it's members, and leaders of the Nazi party. If you want history as told by a leading member of the German High Command this book will not disappoint. If you want edge of your seat story telling this might not be your cup of tea.	2001-12-23
