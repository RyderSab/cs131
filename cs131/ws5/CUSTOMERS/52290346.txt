Don't be scared off, this is a wonderful book.  Its light, cheery, entertaining.  Don't expect the deepest of the deep, but certainly the characters are well developed, story is excellent.  The only reason I reserve 1 star is that maggie's character changed to fast - I felt the last 1/3 rd of the book was too rushed.  Would've liked to seen maggie's progression in a bit more detail.  Would've also like to had more pages in the 3rd half about ella.  enough negativity , read the book!	2004-01-15

The photos, stories, insights into culture - this helped us choose which regions of OZ that we wanted to visit.  For this I give 4 out of 5.  The last star I reserve because some of the smaller places are not listed that are real gems!  It is understandable though that no guide will have every dot on the map, this is why you travel and explore!!  Note: for this sort of preparation and planning activity we have found no better guidebook series!<br />However, what we've found is that these guides are not good for hotels, restaurants, etc - there are a few (expensive!!) listed.  Nor are they good for navigating/driving (we drove Melbourne to Cairns).   I recommend using this guide to prepare and a Lonely Planet to find places to stay/for for more budget conscious traveler needs.  Get a good road map.	2002-11-26

The photos, stories, insights into culture - this helped us choose which regions of OZ that we wanted to visit.  For this I give 4 out of 5.  The last star I reserve because some of the smaller places are not listed that are real gems!  It is understandable though that no guide will have every dot on the map, this is why you travel and explore!!  Note: for this sort of preparation and planning activity we have found no better guidebook series!<br />However, what we've found is that these guides are not good for hotels, restaurants, etc - there are a few (expensive!!) listed.  Nor are the driving (we drove Melbourne to Cairns) listed.   I recommend using this guide to prepare and a Lonely Planet to find places to stay/for for more budget conscious traveler needs.

However, they are not good for finding a reasonably priced place to stay, eat, shop and in general finding your way around.  For this I recommend a good road map and the Lonely Planet guide.  We did 14 days Italy driving from Rome through Tuscany to Florence and the Nat'l Geo guide was essential for planning the trip.	2002-11-26

It was not a typical I know who did it book, I really didn't know.  Great mystery, great clues, suspensful and a little bit different.  I recommend it.	2001-03-25
US	52290346	RE5PN1M34NHR	0440236673	376574359	The Brethren	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A fun story	I liked this one.  After reading &quot;the testament&quot;, I shyed away from Grisham - this one was on the shelf for 6 months and I thought, what the heck.  It isn't extremely complex or as suspensful as &quot;the firm&quot;, but I got lost in the story and wanted to know how all the players would come together.  I found the main characters likeable and found myself cheering for them.  All in all, I read it during a sick day, and it was entertaining and funny, the politics believable and the story not to heavy.	2001-03-25
