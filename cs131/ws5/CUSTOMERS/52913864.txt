The former bomb-squad technician is descending into a vortex of alcohol, cigarettes, and guilt; all the result of a bomb that went off -- literally -- in her face. The resulting explosion scarred her severely, killed her partner (who'd protected her at the cost of his own life), and simultaneously ended the most meaningful romantic relationship she'd ever had.<br /><br />Teetering on edge of a mandatory visit to the Police equivalent of a psych ward, another bomb changes everything. A sinister device discovered in a parking lot takes the life of another of her former partners, bomb-squad tech Bill Roggio. Starkey's expertise is needed because the device had the unique hallmarks of a dreaded serial bomber, known only as \\"Mr. Red.\\"<br /><br />When the ATF shows up, Starkey becomes their liaison to the L.A. Police Department. And her exceptional skills at sniffing out clues leads to the first major break in the case: the explosive mixture included a rare compound called RDX, access to which is limited to the U.S. military.<br /><br />Crais has created a mind-twisting, compelling novel that you can't second-guess. Nothing is as it seems and the masterful plot twists are impossible to predict. Mr. Red is the bomb-squad equivalent of Hannibal Lecter: highly intelligent, completely psychopathic, and deadlier than a rattlesnake. And Starkey is a tough, human heroine trying desperately to veer back onto the road to redemption. But she hits an unexpected pothole when Red shows up: her life will never be the same.	2005-09-18

Decades before, the steamship Arctic, the pride of the Collins line, had suffered a catastrophic collision that resulted in 400 souls lost. The behavior of the crew was hardly the model of civility, though. The fact that only 22 passengers survived the ordeal, along with 65 crewmen, hints at the panic-stricken, near-mutinous conditions aboard the Arctic prior to its demise. <br /> <br />Collins, backed by private and -- controversially -- US Government funds, had created the first credible competitor to Cunard's line of packet ships. When the Crimean war forced Cunard to convert his ships to British naval use, the Collins line had a chance to establish itself as the predominant Transatlantic packet service. But the final voyage of the Arctic helped seal Collins' fate: its foolhardy rush through heavy fog, intended to maintain speed records, resulted in a massive collision with a French, iron-hulled fishing vessel: the Vesta. <br /> <br />While the damages to the Arctic initially appeared slight, all too soon its wooden hull (with no watertight compartments) was discovered to have been holed in three distinct areas. And because the Vesta had left a jagged portion of its bow sticking in the steamship's hull, the traditional methods of patching at sea were rendered impossible. As the ship foundered, panic-stricken crew-members and passengers fought for the all-too-limited number of seats on the lifeboats. <br /> <br />Shaw has done impressive work chronicling a non-fictional story that reads like fiction. But there's a reason Shaw didn't write this work as a novel: there are so many bizarre coincidences and events involved that only a strict recitation of the known facts could have resulted in a believable story. The demise of the Arctic is a chilling tale and one with every bit the controversy, mystery, heroism and cowardice of its much better known counterpart.	2005-08-21

Hiding in a parking garage, someone killed six civilians during rush hour by picking them off, one at a time, in the city plaza. And a bevy of evidence supports the contention that the former sniper, James Barr, is the guilty party. <br /> <br />Rousted out of bed in the middle of the night, Barr has only two things to say: \\"I'm innocent\\" and \\"Get Reacher\\". Having seen the crime and arrest reported on CNN, though, Reacher is already on the way. Using the classic Child formula of investigative and procedural detail, unbridled criminal brutality, and the thinking man's cold-hearted hero, One Shot is a trip on the express lane straight into the darkest corner of the heartlands. <br /> <br />I'll be frank, this isn't Child's best novel. Not even close. Try Persuader, Running Blind or Without Fail for the penultimate Reacher stories. But Child's lesser efforts are so far above the typical \\"thriller\\" that the term seems woefully misplaced. Simply put, Child is the best action-adventure author in the business today. On my scorecard he's nine for nine. Read any of the Reacher novels, in any order, for a surefire adrenaline rush.	2005-06-29

Lewis tracks Oakland A's GM Billy Beane, who built a series of powerhouse ballclubs with a major handicap. Despite having a payroll that was petty cash to teams like the Yankees, Beane's clubs excelled. A series of excellent finishes, culminating with a playoff series that took the Yankees to the limit, solidified Beane's reputation. But how did he do it? <br /> <br />Beane's unconventional methods were the key. Using Bill James (of Baseball Abstract fame) as an inspiration, the A's GM hired the best and brightest statisticians and dispensed with the conventional wisdom of opinionated scouts. So what if a college catcher had a \\"bad baseball body\\"? Beane didn't care. He was concerned with metrics like on-base-percentage, which turns out to be much better at predicting major league success than a scout's biased opinion. <br /> <br />Dealing with players as business units, each with measurable ROI (return on investment), Beane bought low and sold high. If a closer cranked out a bunch of saves, Beane figured he could trade the pitcher for higher value than he was really worth. Saves were a misleading statistic: strikeouts, walks, and home-runs-allowed were really the only true ways to measure a pitcher's performance. A \\"superstar\\" was simply a stat-generating machine and if the same amount of money could be leveraged on someone else that could yield similar stats, why not make a trade? <br /> <br />In retrospect, like all great ideas, Beane's tenets are remarkably simple. It's just interesting that it took baseball over a century to figure out that stats like ERA and RBI were pretty much meaningless. What mattered were stats that historically proved to be predictors of baseball victories: on-base-average and slugging average for batters, for instance. A quick, fascinating read, MoneyBall is an elegant look at a smart GM and his godfather: Bill James.	2005-06-24

A fringe, cult-like group is determined to protect their commune, which is located in the backwoods of Northern California, from development. To do so, they need a credible means to force the state government to cease their incessant land-grabs. With the help of a geologist who's joined the commune, the cult leader (Priest) determines there may be a way to trigger earthquakes using a sonic mapping device known as a seismic vibrator.<br /><br />Follett's talent is prodigious. He's almost capable of making us believe that this preposterous scenario is remotely plausible. But even his immense talent isn't enough to make up for the succession of plot holes big enough to drive a seismic vibrator through.<br /><br />Example: At one point, Michael seems to be the only one in the state who hasn't seen Priest's picture on television. Because Michael encountered Priest early on in the story, he should have recognized him on TV and the entire FBI dragnet should have ended a lot sooner.<br /><br />The puzzle pieces are all there, in formulaic fashion: The cute, female FBI agent. The cute, divorced male geologist Michael. The Manson-like cult leader Priest who, though illiterate, is able to evade the FBI repeatedly while driving a giant seismic vibrator that tops out at about 40 mph. I'm sure you can guess what happens.<br /><br />If you're stuck inside on a rainy day and you happen to have this laying around (and nothing else to do), certainly go ahead and read it. Otherwise, learn macrame or origami. You'll drive yourself crazy second-guessing the characters and the author in this all-too-predictable bore-fest.

The former U.S. Marine just graduated from Harvard Business School and has joined the fast-paced world of Wall Street.  His girlfriend is beautiful, the scion of an incredibly wealthy family.  But Nick does have one problem:  the unsolved murder of his father weighs heavily on his mind. <br /> <br />His father, murdered almost twenty years ago, worked for the secretive Swiss bank USB.  And so Nick decides to follow in his footsteps:  to move to Switzerland, join USB, and determine whether the trail can be followed or whether's it's gone cold. <br /> <br />Within days of joining USB, Nick finds himself entangled in a nightmarish conflict.  The \\"Pasha\\", USB's premier client, is moving ever larger sums of money through the bank in seemingly nonsensical fashion.  The DEA, investigating large-scale money transfers through USB, begins squeezing Nick for information.  And an attractive vice president at the bank seems to be paying very close attention to Nick's activities. <br /> <br />This is Reich's first book and is, simply put, masterful.  While its length (750 pages) is daunting, Reich's firsthand knowledge of the Swiss banking industry is invaluable and enlightening.  I can almost guarantee that you'll be swept into this ambitious and fulfilling story:  revenge and terror mixed into a near-perfect concoction.	2005-06-03

Icon looks several years into the future, to a day where Russian mobs, a teetering economy, and an American-style public relations campaign conspire to carry a man named Komarov to the office of president. <br /> <br />The British embassy in Moscow, however, accidentally acquires a document Komarov never meant to make public. Called The Black Manifesto, it describes his plans to consolidate power, recapture the breakaway Soviet Republics, and launch a program of genocide against any religious group: Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. In this effort, he is funded by a major mafia organization and has the support of a para-military organization not unlike Hitler's brownshirts. <br /> <br />While the manifesto alone is not sufficient to drive official Western government action against Komarov, it is sufficiently worrying that senior officials feel they must act. Retired British spymaster Sir Nigel Irvine, a hero of the Cold War, is brought back into the fold. And spyrunner Jason Monk, formerly of the CIA, is unretired. <br /> <br />Like chessmasters, Irvine and Komarov move their pieces across the board in a brilliant, complex and wide-ranging novel. With the fate of Russian fascism -- and a Nazi-style genocide -- hanging in the balance, Irvine and Monk are the last, best hopes for a democratic Russia.	2005-05-11

You may remember Ms. Klein from the HBO Film based upon her startling story, which won an Academy Award. As a pampered, fifteen year-old Jewish girl in 1939, her idyllic family life came to an abrupt halt when the Nazis rolled into their small Polish town. <br /> <br />For a short period of time, her family was permitted to remain in their house, albeit in the basement. Over time, her family unravelled, shipped off one at a time to the death camps. Her beloved brother, Arthur. Her father. Her mother. All disappeared, never to be seen again. By 1942, she began her journey through a series of increasingly harsh slave-labor camps, using an ability to speak German and a quickly acquired expertise on garment looms. Only through a series of fortuitous coincidences, sacrifices of friends, and even a few benefactors among her captors, was she able to survive the factories. <br /> <br />By 1945, the Nazis were on the run and their prisoners were forced to move back into Germany. Stripped of all possessions except for some photographs tucked into her ski boots (which her father had presciently demanded she wear the summer she left home), she survived the 350-mile winter \\"death march\\". Only 120 of 2000 girls survived the forced march and Gerda herself was liberated by American soldiers only hours from death: she weighed 68 pounds when Lt. Kurt Klein, who was to become her husband, rolled into town. <br /> <br />There are few, if any, more compelling first-person stories of survival against all odds. Perhaps John Ransom's Andersonville Diary qualifies. But those who are unfamiliar with the concept of true evil would do well to read Gerda's unbelievable story of human spirit, and courage without measure.	2005-03-25

Quinnell's Creasy series qualifies.  Forsythe adds to the collection with _Avenger_, the story of Calvin Dexter.  The protagonist is an attorney and triathlete who happens to be a Vietnam Vet.  He served with distinction as a \\"tunnel rat\\" and mastered the art of trapping the Vietcong in their own claustrophobic environs. <br /> <br />After returning to the states, he experiences a personal and painful family tragedy.  From that point forward, Dexter devotes himself to bringing certain parties to justice.  Parties that others fear or are protected by foreign governments. <br /> <br />One such party is Zoran Zilic, a monstrous war criminal who participated in some of the most gruesome war-crimes imaginable as Yugoslavia disintegrated.  Zoran made the fundamental mistake of killing a volunteer aid-worker whose grandfather was a self-made Canadian billionaire.  The grandfather, a World War II veteran, contracts Dexter to track down Zilic and exact certain revenge. <br /> <br />Two issues cloud Dexter's mission.  First off, Zilic has fled Yugoslavia, having seen the writing on the wall.  Secondly, U.S. counter-terror groups have been positioning Zilic to run missions for them in order to combat the rise of Al Qaeda.  Zilic, one of the few persons trusted by the terrorist hierarchy, is the perfect pawn for the U.S.  And they have no desire to have their operation destroyed by a mercenary vigilante like Dexter. <br /> <br />In intricately plotted detail, Forsythe describes how Zilic is tracked down and how Dexter intends to accomplish his mission, come what may.  Forsythe is still at the top of his game and \\"Avenger\\" -- trite name not withstanding -- is an outstanding read.	2005-03-12

But _Hostage_ is a flat-out barn-burner.  Written in a series of third-person vignettes, each from the perspective of a person ensnared in the drama, the action is pulse-pounding and consistently compelling.  Give yourself a few hours because, as trite as it sounds, you -- seriously -- will not want to put this book down.  And I'm not exaggerating in the least. <br /> <br />Within the first few pages, we encounter a trio of hoods who've recently been released from the pen.  On the spur of the moment, they decide to rob a convenience store located in a ritzy, suburban neighborhood.  In seconds, the robbery goes sour and they skeedaddle a ways down the road... until their vehicle suddenly dies.  Exiting the road, they run into a high-end suburban enclave, and quickly end up in the backyard of a beautiful home. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, a father and his two kids are actually in the house.  The trio invades the home, looking for a vehicle or an exit route.  Unfortunately for everyone involved, the police show up a little too quickly, and the scene rapidly degrades into a hostage situation. <br /> <br />All is not as it seems, however.  The accountant is no run-of-the-mill businessman.  He is, in fact, a bookkeeper for the California mob and was only moments away from handing off some critical disks to a courier.  The lives of many parties end up riding on the fate of the disks, from police officers, to mobsters, to the family in the house. <br /> <br />Three words:  just read it.  You won't regret it for a split-second.	2005-03-12

Corey, the ex-NYPD detective, is now working on an FBI anti-terror taskforce as a contract employee. In the summer of 2001, he and his wife Kate attend a memorial service honoring the fifth anniversary of TWA Flight 800, which ended minutes after takeoff in a catastrophic explosion that took all 230 lives aboard. <br /> <br />Despite hundreds of eyewitness accounts that stated something resembling a surface-to-air rocket had touched off the explosion, hundreds of FBI agents, NTSB personnel, and other governmental parties came to the conclusion that an internal spark had triggered an explosion in the central fuel tank. Having investigated the original incident, Corey's FBI agent wife is fed up with the apparent stonewalling and clues her husband onto an interesting, and not widely known, fact regarding the investigation. <br /> <br />A couple was apparently videotaping themselves during a risque frolic in the surf when the explosion occurred. Some investigators believe that their videotape captured the crucial events. One problem: the couple disappeared, most likely because they were adulterers, and there's no way to identify the pair other than a lens cap left on a beach blanket. <br /> <br />Corey doggedly pursues the investigation in an entirely unofficial manner and is quickly confronted with resistance from his administrators. Some top-level officials don't want him turning over any rocks and unearthing more details. And they're willing to take extreme measures to make sure he doesn't pursue the investigation. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, the plot lags towards the middle of the book. But few other authors have mastered sarcastic, entertaining patter in quite the way DeMille has (although Raymond Chandler comes to mind). When Corey arranges to meet an old partner at a Chinese restaurant, he describes the scene: <br /> <br />\\"They were prepping the day's mystery dishes in the kitchen, and I thought I heard a cat, a dog, and a duck, followed by chopping sounds, then silence. Smelled good, though.\\" <br /> <br />Despite a sluggish plot here and there, Corey is a consistently entertaining character and the mystery of Flight 800 is compelling. In fact, I suspect every person who reads this book will be googling the topic upon finishing the book.	2005-02-15
US	52913864	RWUG9EX4NE96A	0316743798	755102072	Flyboys: A True Story of Courage	Books	5	9	19	N	N	A stunning tale of barbarism, courage and loyalty	In a followup to Flags of our Fathers, James Bradley describes his detective work in determining what, exactly, happened to nine airmen shot down over the island of Chichi Jima during World War II.  One was easy: the pilot was George Herbert Walker Bush, 41st President of the United States.  Starting with recently declassified military trials records of Japanese officers on Chichi Jima, his discoveries are both tragic and inspiring.  In fact, these true stories of brutality, courage and honor are sometimes almost beyond belief. <br /> <br />Rather than paint a single \\"snapshot\\" of the air war over the island near the end of World War II, Bradley looks at the big picture.  His history lesson is concise, yet insightful.  The brutal treatment of native Americans and Mexicans during early American expansionism... Commodore Perry's warships and the opening of international relations with Japan... the Russo-Japanese war that set the stage for World War II... the corruption of the Samurai ideal and the outrageous Japanese atrocities in China... all are covered in wide-ranging and learned prose. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have complained about overly harsh treatment of US involvement with native Americans, Commodore Perry's mission, and other alleged \\"political\\" agendas.  Speaking as an avowed conservative, I found nothing obvious that skewed history either way.  War is a brutal business and early Americans were frequently at war.  We cannot pretend otherwise. <br /> <br />The book is crammed full of interesting, historic details:  American arms accounted for only a third of Japanese troop fatalities during World War II - lack of Japanese supply planning and poor strategy account for the remainder.  The religious zeal with which Japanese soldiers were inculcated with the \\"no surrender\\" philosophy resulted in a brutish and barbaric form of war, \\"At Kwajalein, the Japanse garrison lost 4,938, with only 79 taken prisoner, a fatality rate of 98.4 percent.\\" <br /> <br />The result was a perceived need on the part of American military planners to devastate the Japanese homeland, knowing that surrender was untenable for the population.  A War Department report concluded that, \\"defeating Japan would cost... five to  ten million deaths and the United States between 1.7 and 4 million casualties, including 400,000 to 600,000 fatalities.\\"  To put this in perspective, D-Day required 175,000 invading troops.  7,000,000 American troops were in the Pacific by 1945 preparing for Operation Olympic, the first phase of invasion.  Put in these terms, the fire-bombings and atomic attacks seem almost humane in that the corrupt Japanse military leaders were forced to succumb before millions of more lives were snuffed out. <br /> <br />This is a stunning book that paints a picture of almost unbelievable courage, honor and loyalty.  Five stars, without question.	2005-01-29

Why do hundreds of swift boat veterans who served on companion ships oppose Kerry?  Why do 22 of 23 fellow OIC's (Officers) in Coastal Division oppose him?  Why does Kerry's entire chain of command oppose him?  And, most importantly, why won't Kerry set the record straight by signing a Form 180 to release all of his DOD records?  These are important questions and ones which should be addressed immediately. <br /> <br />O'Neill uses Kerry's own book (\\"The New Soldier\\", which codified many of his claims of atrocities and illegal military actions), Brinkley's book, official reports, and many eye-witnesses, to show that Kerry's accounts disagree (often dramatically) with documented events.  And it is telling, that Kerry has already had to backtrack from some of his accounts (e.g., Christmas in Cambodia and fleeing the scene with the four other Swift Boats). <br /> <br />But there are big gaps in O'Neill's logic as well.  The main issue is why only one of Kerry's crew members (serving under him, during the actions in question) opposes his candidacy.  O'Neill should have addressed this issue simply for the sake of completeness. <br /> <br />Still, when there are so many discrepencies in what Kerry has reported and when hundreds of Swift Boat Veterans oppose Kerry's accounts (and his Candidacy), there is a single question that comes to mind:  are O'Neill and the Swift Boat Vets credible enough to call into question Kery's fitness to be Commander-In-Chief?  This is a question that can only be answered by the readers, and only for themselves.	2004-08-21

His contention that the mainstream media was biased toward the Left struck many as obvious, but the management of CBS was not among them.  'Bias' covers the days and months after the column was published, the reaction by his colleagues, and a more thorough analysis of the media's reporting habits. <br /> <br />Reknowned for its history of credible reporting (epitomized by Edward R. Murrow), CBS turned a blind eye to Goldberg's critique and, instead of examining the issue, attacked the messenger with callous disregard.  Goldberg, a self-described liberal who had never voted Republican, soon found himself without a role at CBS and eventually without a job. <br /> <br />What is most shocking about this tale is not the overwhelming evidence that the media consistently sides with liberal causes, but the brutality with which CBS management attacked him.  You'd imagine a network that promotes whistle-blowing in every segment of business and government (e.g., 60 Minutes) would be willing to examine its own industry.  But you'd be wrong.  Led by the cult of Dan (Rather), who wields considerable force among the head honchos, CBS overreacted with an astounding pattern of official denials and sanctioned counter-attacks. <br /> <br />Goldberg carefully examines the hot-button issues of the last two decades:  AIDS, homelessness, and terrorism among them.  He notes the spin, the politicization and the woeful omissions that, while newsworthy, won't sell advertising.  For example, Goldberg found it interesting that homelessness in the country apparently ceased to exist when Bill Clinton took office (especially amazing, since it started the day Reagan was sworn in), based upon an analysis of mainstream media coverage.  He eulogizes AIDS activist Randy Shilts, who was, \\"...courageous enough to say that despite what the media were telling America, AIDS was not 'The Killer Next Door'.\\" <br /> <br />And he points out the double standard applied to journalists like USA Today columnist Julianne Malveaux who publicly hoped for Clarence Thomas' death; or NPR's Nina Totenberg's desire that Jessie Helms and his grandchildren contract AIDS.  If conservative journalists advocated similar fates for Jessie Jackson or Ted Kennedy, they'd be out of a job in seconds flat. <br /> <br />Goldberg closes with a careful look at how the media treats terrorism, Islam as a whole, and the Palestinian position regarding Israel.  Simply put, the facts of the situation do not reflect what the media has been reporting.  And in this, the age of nuclear terrorism, the omissions are truly stunning. <br /> <br />If you already believe in the media's liberal bias, you'll enjoy the anecdotes and statistics that support your contention.  And if you don't believe it, read the latest peer-reviewed study of the issue* and then read this book.  You might just gain a different perspective on the matter. <br /> <br />* See \\"A Measure of Media Bias\\", UCLA & University of Chicago, Sept. 2003	2004-08-12

Those reviewers who claim the information is fabricated need to recognize two simple facts:  (a) people who aren't honest don't get 'Yankee White' security clearances, which the Military Aides must have; and (b) someone would have sued for libel had these startling allegations been groundless. <br /> <br />The most shocking allegation relates to Clinton's unwillingness to make a decision while Sandy Berger awaited a 'go' order to launch a major raid on Iraq.  His reason?  He was too busy -- for several hours -- talking with Vernon Jordan and watching golf.  Berger apparently called several times during the window of opportunity, but by the time Clinton got around to calling back, the mission had been aborted. <br /> <br />Other Clinton gaffes:  losing the nuclear launch codes (the only time they've ever been irretrievably lost); leaving a meeting -- and the aide with the nuclear football -- behind due to impatience; and his administration's questionable dealings with China that many believe gave it access to the US military's ICBM technology. <br /> <br />In the second part of the book, Patterson calls into question Clinton's 'CNN diplomacy'.  As he points out, \\"from 1946 to 1991, the [US] deployed military troops in eight foreign campaigns.  During the Clinton years, we deployed troops to at least 40 separate foreign locations.\\"  The classic example was turning tail in Somalia (after preventing the military from deploying its requestedweapons systems like AC-130s) sufficiently emboldened one of the instigators that few had heard of before: Osama bin Laden.  OBL used America's retreat successfully as a recruiting tool. <br /> <br />Because of Clinton's unwillingness to act decisively, and treating terrorism as a law enforcement problem, Patterson pins 9/11 directly on Clinton.  \\"From 1993 to 2001, Islamic terrorists attacked American targets eight separate times.  If there's anything beyond scandal that we should most remember about the Clinton years, this is it: They were the years that terrorists brought their war to the [America].\\" <br /> <br />And he brings up additional damning evidence: A 1996 Presidential Daily Brief that that referenced a plot to use commercial airliners as weapons.  Patterson categorically states that both Clinton and his intelligence leadership knew about the 9/11-style attack five years prior.  The administration's constant efforts to run the country based upon poll numbers was the culprit, according to Patterson. <br /> <br />Two nits to pick:  there is a fair amount of unsubstantiated innuendo and gossip:  were the missing Rose law records really in Hillary's plastic file container that had to travel with her at all times?  Was Hillary really a b**ch to the staff?  We could have probably done without the speculation.  Also - the book was very short - probably worthy of a long magazine article (in \\"Vanity Fair\\", perhaps ? :-) instead.  Maybe it probably should have been made into a full blown biography of Patterson.  Nonetheless it is informative and quite disturbing. <br /> <br />Clinton himself was personally quite likable, Patterson says.  But his eight years as Commander-in-Chief were a disaster from the standpoint of foreign relations and national security.  Islamic terrorists, North Korea's secret nuclear program, and the Pakistani nuclear parts network all flourished under Clinton's watch.  And that truly will be his legacy.	2004-08-07
US	52913864	R1AF40RPDMZ1JH	0060582510	541105320	Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism	Books	5	16	46	N	N	Surprising and chilling - masterful summary of Politics 2004	It would be easy to dismiss Sean Hannity as just another in a long line of long-winded, conservative pundits interested only in self-promotion. That's what I figured about his latest work. In fact, I only bothered to read this book because I'd nothing better to do while at the beach. It's a quick read - and much better, and more chilling, than I'd anticipated.      Hannity devotes the first fifty pages to Nazi Germany. In one of the best, terse summaries of the Holocaust that I've ever read, he boils down the central failings of the left's inability to understand evil. When Neville Chamberlain returned from meeting with Hitler promising &quot;Peace in our Time&quot;, it cemented the role of appeasement when dealing with despots. Tens of millions of needless deaths later, we can boil it down this way: appeasement -- when negotiating with evil -- is a precursor to mass murder.      Moving on to the Cold War, Hannity points out the flaws of treating the Soviets as anything but evil. Estimates put the world-wide death toll of communism at around 95 million. That's 95 million people murdered through pogroms, death camps, and starvation.      Yet the left, led by Jimmy Carter, was &quot;in shock&quot; when the Soviets rolled into Afghanistan. And, further, by failing to support the Shah of Iran (who, while a violator of human rights, was infinitely better for the Iranian people and stability of the region), paved the way for Saddam Hussein's war with Iran and the Middle East conflagrations in which we must engage today. Nicaragua, the gutting of the CIA, and other monumental gaffes were all due to a Carter administration that could not comprehend evil... and that it cannot be appeased.      This, of course, led to the Reagan administration, whose intolerance for evil was famous. When Libya's agents murdered Americans in Berlin, Reagan pushed for an immediate response. The left, led by none other than John Kerry, equivocated. After Reagan bombed Qaddafi, Kerry wrote, &quot;...there are numerous other actions that we can take, in concert with our allies, to bring ... pressure to bear on countries supporting or harboring terrorists.&quot; Reagan's results stand. Qaddafi folded his hand, and because the current administration crushed the A.Q. Khan nuclear parts network, Libya has reentered the international community.      Hannity then moves onto the UN and 'the fraud of multi-lateralism' (another tenet of the left). As a peacekeeper, the UN required five months to raise 3,000 troops for Rwanda. As the situation dissolved, it passed resolutions. It embargoed arms shipments. Meanwhile, 800,000 Rwandans were murdered and 2,000,000 became refugees... all while president Clinton, Albright, and General Wesley Clark hemmed and hawed. The UN is a beauracracy, torn by conflicting interests, corruption and ill-will towards the U.S. Hannity states, &quot;...the Democrats will pound away with... politically motivated questions: Did we have to go to war? Should we have waited a little longer? Did the president shade the truth?... The American people should ask a different question: When it came to protecting American lives, and preserving freedom around the world, whom do you trust to get the job done?&quot;      The final section of the book describes the post 9/11 world and the threat of terrorism. Rare voices from the left join in to support the president's aggressive pursuit of evil: Koch, Cuomo, Miller. But they are the exceptions. The left has turned the pursuit of evil into a political game, when in reality the stakes could not be higher. Hannity closes with his perspective on the fallacy of the left's willingness to hedge every argument for political gain... and what the future holds, on a country-by-country basis. He closes, &quot;...we cannot prevail tomorrow without courageous leadership today. Our leaders will choose how we meet the challenges of the future -- with strength and conviction, or with cowardice and accommodation.&quot;Today, we are locked in a war with evil incarnate: the other side believes that anyone who fails to think as they do deserves to die. It is high time for the left to recognize that we are dealing with evil. And history's lessons are especially clear. Appeasement could mean disaster, especially in this, the nuclear age.      Which party do you trust to pursue evil to the ends of the earth?	2004-07-15
US	52913864	R1FNPNOW1OX2OT	0743453972	977134384	Memorial Day (Mitch Rapp)	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Rapp is back... and Flynn is back in the Pantheon	At last.  High-level CIA operative Mitch Rapp is back.  A Rapp-led special forces team wreaks havoc on a terrorist enclave located in no-man's land on the Pakistani/Afghani border.  What they find in a terrorist bunker is literally earth-shattering:  a map of Washington DC complete with concentric blast circles.  And it's apparently a damage estimate based upon the planned detonation of a 20-kiloton nuclear weapon near the DC downtown.<br />Through violent, but off-the-record means, Rapp interviews the five remaining terrorists.  Only a couple survive the interviews, but Rapp has most of the information he needs.  A nuke is scheduled to enter the U.S. on a container ship from Karachi.  While the weapon is being tracked down, an ironic turn of events is occurring within the Attorney General's office.  The Patriot Act is a political hot potato and senior members of the State Department are moving to kill the Act to save the president's re-election bid.<br />Rapp, true to form and ignoring politics completely, is more concerned with another issue:  is another nuke entering the country as a fallback plan for the terrorists?  And when the State Department starts treating the nuclear threat inside the US like it's a law enforcement problem, Rapp unleashes the dogs of war.<br />After Flynn's last book -- a disappointing effort in my view -- I made a few suggestions.  Amazingly, he seemed to take them or, at least, arrive at them on his own.<br />1) Anna Rielly out of the picture:  check<BR>2) The real war on terror is now front and center: checkety check<BR>3) Rapp goes on a Creasy*-like revenge extravaganza: check and mate, beeotch<br />Memorial Day is more than a pot-boiler thriller; it raises the compelling issue of human rights.  At what point, for instance, is it acceptable to torture a suspect when the information could save a hundred thousand lives?  I rate this novel 9 out of 10.  On the merits of his latest effort, Flynn is back in the pantheon (Raymond Chandler,Lee Child, Nelson DeMille, CS Forester, and *AJ Quinnell)... on probation, but moving up fast.	2004-06-23
US	52913864	RR1PHF5BPG69O	0895260662	128535120	Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror	Books	5	60	74	N	N	Live in America?  Then read this book TODAY.	Don't read this book because its authors are highly qualified (an Asst. Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force and a deputy commanding general of the U.S Army, respectively).  And don't read it just because their analysis for Fox News has been spot on so far (when others were predicting military disasters in Afghanistan and Iraq, they correctly predicted the military campaigns).  Instead, read it as if your life depends on it.  Because it probably does.<br />The authors first describe the gravity of the war against terror.  They demonstrate that fundamentalist extremists -- in many countries -- have repeatedly demonstrated that they have no qualms about using any and all means necessary to slaughter innocent civilians.  In escalating, nightmarish scenarios, they describe the outcomes of a failure to quickly and completely deal with the \\"Web of Terror\\".  At the top of the heap, of course, is the very real scenario involving the simultaneous detonation of nuclear weapons in multiple U.S. cities.<br />The second section of the book describes how we fight:  both defensively and offensively.  The campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are described in excellent detail.  And for those who claim that the Iraq campaign was simply a distraction in the war against terror, the authors beg to differ:<br />\\"Saddam Hussein's Iraq kept bad company -- as one might expect of a regime that practiced mass executions, torture, and arbitrary arrest and imprisonment and used chemical weapons against its own people.  Iraq had extensive dealings with terrorists.  Two Palestinians at the top many ... \\"most wanted\\" lists in the 1980's and ... 1990's -- Abu Nidal... and Abu Abbas -- were given sanctuary by Saddam Hussein... Nidal led an organization that committed a number of bloody attacks... [and] masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, a crime that included the murder of [an]... American passenger.  Iraq provided training camps for terrorists, most notoriously at SalmanPak... where an obsolescent Boeing 707 was used to train terrorists to hijack airliners.  Iraq made cash payments to the families of ... suicide bombers.  [Iraq's] vice president... was specifically tasked with supporting... the PLO, Hamas, and ... Islamic Jihad... in addition, the al-Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Islam, was based in Northern Iraq...\\"<br />Thus, Hussein's massive human rights violations, support of terrorism world-wide, and development and use of WMD's made him a first-tier target in the war on terror.  The authors rejected a continuance of the containment policy because sanctions had been subverted by regimes like Syria; international support was wavering; and French, German, and Russion businesses continued to stoke Saddam's massive weapons programs.<br />The final section of the book discusses how we must wage the war on terror... country by country.  In some cases, diplomacy is recommended.  In others, quick military action is advocated.  The rationale, strategies and tactics are all discussed in compelling detail.  Wrapping up, the authors state:<br />\\"Our fight, however, is not against a religion.  The vast majority of Muslims are obviously peacable people.  Our fight is against those who... [would] ... turn Islam into a terrorist creed preaching global violence and revolution.  What we can and must do is act against those regimes that train, shelter, and support the terrorists who are bent on killing us (Iran and Syria); put further pressure on Muslim states to curtail radical Islam within their own borders (Egypt, Pakistan); stop Muslim states from subsidizing intolerant religous beliefs around the world (Saudi Arabia); and demand, and bring about, an end to the WMD programs of rogue states (North Korea).  We must declare a \\"no sanctuary for terrorists\\" policy and enforce it.  [We] must be a faithful ally to those Muslim countries that openly oppose Islamist terror and ... stand for tolerance and liberalization... like Morocco, Qatar and Bahrain... [We] must promote economic, political, religious and social freedom through the entire Muslim world...\\"<br />It is only in the book's afterword that politics are discussed.  The authors state that they have purposely written the book from a military perspective.... not political.  However, the Democratic primaries -- in which nearly every candidate denied the existence of a terror network and stated that only \\"al-Qaeda\\" is the enemy.  The fallacy of that denial is described in great detail throughout the book.  The corruption of the UN's \\"oil-for-food program\\", the intrinsic monetary links between Hussein and Europe, make relying upon either the UN or conflicted countries like France, Germany and Russia, a foolhardy and dangerous exercise.  Unfortunately, the apparent Democratic candidate for President was one of these candidates.<br />\\"The Web of Terror will want to influence America's presidential elections because [it] will not survive four more years of George W. Bush.\\"  At stake is nothing less than the survival of the United States.  Overstatement?  The authors clearly demonstrate otherwise.  Read this book.  And get your friends and family to read it as well.  It's simply that important.	2004-06-14

It's 1990 and the Soviet Union is teetering on the brink of collapse.  Transfered, apparently for no reason, to Fort Bird, he's immediately confronted with a dead body.  Not a problem, except this body belongs to a General.<br />The Armored Cav officer has been found in a hotel room after an *ahem* liaison and the cause of death appears natural.  Problem is, the General's briefcase is missing.  In Reacher's pursuit of the briefcase, a Delta Force Sergeant ends up dead -- the victim of a grisly homicide -- and Reacher is the prime suspect.<br />Now Reacher needs to solve two mysteries and he has a week to do it:  some Delta Force buddies of the Sergeant have given him a week to find the murderer... or Reacher will suffer the consequences.<br />Frankly, it doesn't get any better than Lee Child.  He really is in the \\"pantheon\\", at the level of elite authors who are (or were) consistently great.  Raymond Chander, A.J. Quinnell, Nelson DeMille, C.S. Forester...  the only problem with reading Child's books is the wait for the next one after you finish.	2004-05-29

Less noir and more documentary, it describes the lives of two families, the DePinos and the Sussmans. Joey DePino is a working stiff with a major league gambling problem and a violent loanshark after him. His wife, Melissa, is disenchanted with her life, especially as she sees friends like Leslie Sussman get ahead. Leslie is married to David, an ad exec, and living in a ritzy Upper East Side apartment.<br />But David's life isn't all peaches and cream. A beautiful Asian co-worker, with whom he's had an affair, has turned psychopathic. As Joey struggles to pay off his debts and David grapples with an insane mistress, things go south in a hurry. And, typical of Starr's work, lives are lost in the process.<br />This is Starr's second book and, while not as cleverly plotted as Cold Caller, you'll get diabolical pleasure out of watching some stupid people do irrevocably stupid things. It's realistic, compelling stuff and Starr is a consistently entertaining author.	2004-04-26

Picking up almost immediately at the point that _Another Day In Paradise_ left off, Bobby Prine is killing time in a hard-core Indiana youth facility, trying to avoid the next race riot that will either kill him or send him packing to adult prison.  On the razor's edge, he determines that only escape will save him from the fate that awaits him in either correctional facility.  With a couple of friends, he does manage to flee... the crew makes their way to New York and then Boston, hooking up with a variety of other crime gangs, some of whom are very dubious partners.  Prine's small crew manages to fund themselves through a moderately successful set of crimes, ranging from check-kiting to hijacking.<br />But a truly big score awaits:  a Boston museum is displaying a collection of rare coins that a major collector desperately wants -- and he's willing to pay as much as $600K.  Realizing that the competing gangs may double-cross his group, Prine tries to set up a triple-cross.  But an increasingly serious drug habit and some girlfriend problems have helped cloud his mind.  As the violence escalates, the reader feels just as trapped as Prine: can he survive long enough to realize one final, big score?  And clean himself up in the bargain?<br />Little is straight out of the Eddie Bunker school of crime writers: guys who know exactly what they're talking about and wrap you into a near-psychopathic experience.  You'll feel the anger, the addiction, the joy and rgaing pain that Prine experiences.  Because this is raw, moving and -- ultimately -- stunning material.<br />p.s., As I understand it, Little passed away recently (heart attack).  What a tragedy... he had so much to offer us.  Luckily, we have this book and the previous one - and his memory will live as long as these books are around.  And that will be quite some time.	2004-04-21

Restarting his career as a telemarketer (for a lot less money), he and his co-workers are routinely humiliated by a petty and racist supervisor.  But things get more tolerable for Moss when a chance lie he tells to the company's President results in a surprise promotion.

Now he's got a dead body in his office and a bunch of violent p imps chasing him.  And things go downhill from there.<br />_Cold Caller_ is a seductively easy read that has several exquisite plot points.

And the most skillful among them -- say, a Jim Thompson -- had the reader gradually empathasizing with these outcasts.  Jason Starr can stand toe to toe with any of these authors.  His _Tough Luck_ is an expertly written story.<br />Mickey Prada is a poor kid trying to make good.  Working in a fish market while saving for college, he also takes care of his Alzheimer's-ridden Dad.  Things are going pretty well for Mickey until a slick-looking mobster walks into the fish shop.  Angelo Santoro starts talking football and betting with Mickey.  Before long, Mickey's placing 'good faith' bets for Angelo.  And Angelo keeps losing.  Now Mickey's in the hole to his bookie and Angelo won't make good on his debt.<br />In order to get out of hock, his lifelong friend Chris proposes a house burglary with a few of their buddies.  It'll be easy money, what with the homeowners on vacation.  And Mickey will surely be able to pay off the bookie and maybe pick up some nice trinkets for his new girlfriend.  It all sounds so simple.  But nothing goes quite as you might expect -- and none of the well-drawn characters will ever be the same after _this_ caper.<br />Starr writes with exquisite attention to detail.  The jargon of the early eighties... the fashion... the culture... all are snapshots wrapped around the realistic foibles of each character.  I'll definitely be picking up the rest of Starr's books.  It's easily some of the best noir fiction going.	2004-03-14

Unless something strange happens -- a rift in space and time perhaps -- I won't be reading any more of these.  Portrayed by the marketing material as tough-guy, noir fiction akin to Chandler's Marlowe or Child's Reacher, Streeter is not even in the same league as those characters.<br />We wait until page 146 to get any kind of action involving the protagonist.  The pacing is deadly slow and the storyline (not lines... just line) hits lull after lull.  You'll know who the bad guy is within, oh, 50 pages or so.<br />The sad thing is that Stone has writing ability.  He isn't a bad technician.  And once in a while Streeter even cracks wise, like the great characters often do.  Problem is, the humor and sarcastic comments are few and far between.  Combine that fact with a story-line that isn't even remotely engaging... well, you pretty much get the last Streeter I will ever read.	2004-03-12

Can a single man -- Padway --change history and prevent the fall of Rome?  Nothing less than the 'Age of Enlightenment' hangs in the balance.<br />The literary descendent of 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', de Camp lets Padway grapple with raw issues.  I found these areas the story's most interesting sections:  how to make a living, having arrived with only modern currency in hand...  how to avoid the authorities, given their proclivity to brand any new technology 'witchcraft'... how to assemble allies, fend off enemies and stay healthy in an environment not conducive to outsiders.<br />Because it was written in 1939, there is a level of 'political incorrectness' that is entertainingly fresh.  Italian women, Muslims, the French and others are insulted with broad brush-strokes.  Nonetheless, it is historically informative, important from a literary standpoint and makes for interesting reading.  Despite its age, it is a fluid, fast read.  de Camp had a lot of interesting things to say... and said them well.	2004-02-29

The scientist's chest has been branded - with the unmistakable symbol of the mysterious group called 'The Illuminati'.  Worse, the scientist's most recent discovery - antimatter secured in a magnetic container - has been stolen.  The antimatter is a dangerous explosive, akin to a nuclear weapon, co-developed by the scientist's attractive daughter.  She accompanies Langdon in the fast-paced search for the weapon, which leads to the Vatican.<br />Thought to have perished years ago, the Illuminati are a shadowy lot -- founded by scientists like Galileo --and have battled the Catholic Church for centuries.  The hunt for the murderous thieves -- and the Illuminati -- all point to a devastating plot to destroy the Vatican and, with it, the Catholic Church.  Using ancient and modern clues, Rome's landmarks, and fascinating historical documents from Vatican archives, Langdon tracks the killers like a bloodhound.  Complicating matters is a Papal Conclave, with hundreds of Cardinals sealed into the Vatican while electing a new Pope... and sitting on a time-bomb.<br />_Angels & Demons_ is a roller-coaster ride.

But when Rachel and her team discover evidence of fraud, all hell breaks loose.<br />Action, science, adventure, exploration: Brown has done a great job - much, much improved over previous work like _Digital Fortress_.  If you want a great escapist, adventure story - look no further.	2004-01-16

As one who ripped through all eleven of Forester's magnificent Hornblower books - and greatly enjoyed the film _Master and Commander _ - I was squarely in O'Brian's gun-sites.  I should have been completely captivated by this book.  It describes the formative journey of &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey, Captain of the frigate HMS Sophie, and Dr. Stephen Maturin, ship surgeon and naturalist, as they do their part in various Napoleonic naval engagements.<br />The plotting is very well done.  The action is unpredictable and the deck-splintering naval actions are pulse-pounding.  What is vexing is the formidable language the O'Brian has chosen.  Probably historically accurate (too historically accurate?), be prepared to slog through dialogue such as Maturin's complaint about Aubrey's skirt-chasing:<br />&quot;I do indeed, sir, and am much obliged to you for your candour in telling me this; it confirms what was in my mind, and I shall do all I can to make him conscious of the delicacy of his position.  Though upon my word... there are times when it seems to me that nothing short of a radical ablation of the membrum virile would answer, in this case...&quot;<br />Thus, please do not expect Forester's masterful use of language or a direct, Hornblower-esque story.  Nevertheless, if you can handle the period language - and daunting naval terminology - _Master and Commander_ is for you.	2004-01-11

It is neither dry, formulaic or predictable - even for those familiar with the enigmatic genius.  Simply put, it is fascinating, exciting reading.  Tesla was credited with the invention of modern AC power generation,  remote control, fundamental advances in radio, wireless voice- and data-transfer, the first laser, advanced flight concepts, and a myriad of other inventions.  Yet he died without ever achieving the financial rewards one would expect for a man who was truly ahead of his time.<br />Taking advantage of ill-defined intellectual property laws and the vagaries of  international court systems, other well-known inventors such as Pupin, Marconi, and Steinmetz either &quot;borrowed&quot; his discoveries or helped write him out of the history books.  While many rode Tesla's coattails to public recognition and, often, staggering financial success - the great man was left penniless and alone.<br />Seifer pulls no punches.  Tesla made a series of startling gaffes.  From ill-conceived contracts with Westinghouse (leaving him with no ongoing revenue from his discovery of the AC polyphase system) to poor management of critical projects backed by J.P. Morgan, Tesla disappointed his financiers time and time again.  Lack of prioritization, spinning off in too many directions simultaneously, poor project management - all contributed to Tesla's inability to achieve the breakthrough he needed (and deserved) for true financial independence.<br />Seifer covers Tesla's life in exceptional detail.  His bizarre work habits (often sleeping only two hours a night), his odd social life (never married and apparently a lifelong celibate), and his many other idiosyncrasies are described with fascinating anecdotes.  You don't need to be an Electrical Engineer, or a Scientist, or even technically savvy to thoroughly enjoy _Wizard_.  In a nutshell: superb.	2003-12-30

As portrayed by Brown, the NSA relies upon stealth, brainpower and technological wizardry to monitor the world's voice and data communications.  The plot revolves around a brilliant, ex-NSA scientist, Tankado.  Worried about the government's ability to monitor all communications, he has threatened the release of a totally new cryptographic technology, termed &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;.<br />Digital Fortress is impervious to traditional &quot;brute force&quot; attacks and, thus, the NSA's highly parallel supercomputers.  The only chance to contain this groundbreaking technology lies with Susan Fletcher, head cryptographer, and her fiance, David Becker, who has been sent to Spain to retrieve Digital Fortress' only key.<br />Ignoring the book's technological explanations (many of the cryptographic and other details are flat-out wrong), the plot is pretty exciting.  Few novels deal with the NSA with all of the requisite, technically daunting explanations... but Brown has rendered a pretty exciting story around the NSA, even if many of the background details are off-base.	2003-11-17

In this comprehensive history of the Bureau, he covers the administrative capabilities of each director and highlights noteworthy cases.  Successes and gaffes are treated honestly and usually characterized by witnesses on both sides.<br />And that's what makes this book really good.  Kessler has talked to nearly all of the major players, from the directors down to the field agents.  The pros and cons of everyone from Hoover (who, apparently would be serving time right now, if still alive ;-) to Freeh and Mueller are openly discussed with dissenting sides encouraged to speak.<br />If you're interested in discovering Hoover, the FBI and M.L. King, David Koresh, Oklahoma City, 9/11, and many more historical topics, _The Bureau_ will be an intriguing read.  Histories of governmental institutions shouldn't be this entertaining!<br />This is an excellent, yet unvarnished, history of the greatest crime-fighting institution the world has ever seen.	2003-11-11

Within moments, his friend - the local police chief - has presented him with an opportunity to view a crime scene.  Two neighbors - husband and wife - have been shot at their nearby home.  Interestingly, the couple both happened to have been employed by the U.S. Agriculture Department's Plum Island facility, specializing in animal-borne infectious diseases.<br />Given the nature of the work - and its applicability to bio-terrorism - CIA and FBI officials start showing up.  The small-town police chief needs a competent detective to help determine what's happened.  Thus, the visit to Corey's house.  Before long, Corey is swept into a mystery of intriguing proportions:  were the victims attempting to sell the tools for bio-warfare and double-crossed... or something else entirely?  While Corey is unable to work effectively with the government investigators -given his unoffical stature and lack of security credentials - he stumbles on a plausible, quite interesting, and perhaps fatal (for him) - reason for the crime.<br />It took me several attempts to grind through the first 70 pages... while not initially as engaging as its successor, once it did grab me, it was pretty darn good.  DeMille can, and mostly has, written more compelling material, but even at four stars, it's well beyond what most other authors can ever hope to accomplish.	2003-09-18

Within three pages of _Persuader_, I was literally talking to myself (&quot;holy sh...&quot;).  My wife kept looking at me funny, wondering what was so compelling in this latest Reacher story.  Put it this way... Lee Child has definitely joined the pantheon of action/adventure/mystery writers.  Raymond Chandler, Robert Crumley, Nelson DeMille and A.J. Quinnell are the other members of 'the pantheon' (Child replaces Vince Flynn, who dropped out of the elite group after his disappointing _Separation of Power_, IMHO ;-).<br />Jack Reacher, cop-killer?  Jack Reacher, rescuing a kidnap victim from a SWAT team of bad guys?  Jack Reacher, almost getting torn limb-from-limb by a steroid-engorged martial artist?  All this, and the most evil character he's ever gone up against, are all on display in this can't miss thriller.  You will literally be on the edge of your seat for each of the 300+ pages... seriously.<br />If you've missed the other Reacher stories, don't worry.  You can definitely read them  out of order.  Or start with _Killing Floor_ and rip through them all.  This is a top shelf mystery/adventure story and Child is on a roll.

And _Running Blind_ is the best one yet, which is saying something.  Former military cop Jack Reacher is in New York City, reconsidering the impact his inherited house and relationship has on his beloved \\"vagabond\\" lifestyle.  He happens upon a small-time protection racket and quickly, violently deals with the situation.  Within hours, he is pulled off the streets by a SWAT team of feds.<br />It turns out he was already under surveillance; he's one of the prime suspects in a serial murder case.  Several retired female soldiers have been killed in their homes under circumstances that are truly bizarre.  Since he had served with two of the women, he's one of the key suspects that the FBI profilers have identified.<br />Proving his innocence, inciting a mob war, and tracking down the real killer are all on the agenda.  Reacher is tough, sarcastic, and a completely entertaining character.  And don't worry about reading the Reacher series in order - I didn't, and did not miss a beat.  Each story seems to stand alone just fine.	2003-07-30

After a devastating shipwreck off the coast of England - which resulted in thousands of lives lost - Parliament offered a stunning prize of 20,000 pounds sterling (the equivalent of perhaps $20 million today) to any person who could solve \\"the longitude problem\\".<br />Over six decades, John Harrison - an exceedingly clever \\"horologist\\" (timepiece builder) - defied the conventional scientific wisdom of an astrological solution to the problem.  Building a chronometer suitable for both wide temperature ranges and the continual pitch and yaw of maritime travel proved exceedingly difficult.  Yet Harrison's creative attempts were stunningly accurate and unbelievably durable.  How he built these complex devices - and handled the politically incorrect nature of his approach - is the story of Longitude.<br />This is a wonderful, fast-moving read which covers a topic of surprising import.	2003-07-24

Whether it has any merit in reality is another issue altogether, but the story-line is truly engaging.  Hidden within the works of Da Vinci are clues to another story of Christ; one banned by the Church in its early days to solidify its power base and to make its message consistent to followers.  Documents (e.g., the Gnostic Gospels) and artifacts relating to this &quot;other history&quot; were destroyed, its leaders killed and any records of its existence purged.<br />Playing large roles in the story are obscure but interesting (and real) societies such as Opus Dei - the orthodox Vatican prelature - and the secret society called the Priory of Sion, founded in 1099.  Weaving in generous portions of real events, artwork, historical biography, Brown does a wonderful job depicting the power struggle over control of Christianity.<br />Playing lesser roles to the historical background are the protagonists, including symbologist Robert Langdon and cryptologist Sophie Neveu.  These two - and the &quot;action side&quot; of the plot - require that the reader suspend belief occasionally... since when does a French police detective have authority to do enforce laws within the borders of England, for instance?  But these players are all subjugated by the astounding historical backdrop.  Truly fascinating and well-written - the Da Vinci Code is certainly worth reading.  It is unlikely you will put it down until you've exhausted every page.	2003-07-22

Growing up poor, in East L.A., Bandini endures a succession of menial jobs to help support his mother and sister.  His odd, self-taught upbringing gives him a huge vocabulary and the willingness to employ it at a moment's notice.  Bandini is insecure, shy, well-spoken and monumentally unfit for adulthood.<br />_The Road to Los Angeles_ describes Bandini's rites of passage and inevitable coming of age.  Covering his relationships with &quot;hidden women&quot;, his attempt at a first novel and a spate of unabashed cruelty towards various creatures, the protaganist is humorous but apparently teetering on the brink of insanity.<br />Bandini's BB-gun-fueled &quot;war with the crabs&quot; is a wonderfully comic extravaganza of unwarranted viciousness... &quot;I shot crabs all that afternoon, until my shoulder hurt behind the gun and my eyes ached behind the gunsight. I was Dictator Bandini, Ironman of Crabland.  This was another Blood Purge for the Fatherland. The had tried to unseat me, those damned crabs... had actually questioned the might of Superman Bandini!  Well, they were going to get a lesson they would never forget.

With much anticipation, I picked up _Executive Power_ expecting a Mitch Rapp energized by current world events: 9/11, WMD's, Afghanistan, Iraq? None of these topics even play a bit role in this book.<br />Rapp is back, working in the CIA office and domesticated as the husband of Anna Rielly.  I soon found myself skipping over pages that mentioned their marital issues.  Rielly's relationship with Rapp is unfailingly boring and even Irene Kennedy's initial conflict with Rielly over her husband's job turns into a syrupy feel-good relationship.  Argh!<br />The main thrusts of the book are a kidnapping of American tourists by Philippine separatists and a plot by a Saudi prince and a tough Palestinian assassin (\\"David\\") to force the creation of a Palestinian state.  What these two threads have to do with one another, I have yet to figure out.  Both are disappointly executed, other than the highlight of the entire book: a Rapp-led SEAL attack on Philippine terrorists.<br />With all of the great, current-events fodder for Flynn to work with, his choices of a relatively unexciting Philippine separatist group and the machinations of an obese Saudi prince seem, at best, mediocre.  We can only hope that an assassin whacks Anna Rielly and sets Mitch Rapp off on a \\"Creasy\\"-like* revenge extravaganza.<br />* See \\"Man on Fire\\", by A.J. Quinnell	2003-06-14

Upon the recommendation (and reputation) of his deceased brother - who was a former Treasury agent - Reacher is asked to perform a security audit on the Vice President's security detail.  Ostensibly, the reason is simply to validate the new team's level of preparedness.  But nothing is quite as it seems - and Reacher soon understands that there are very real, very imminent threats against the VP.<br />We encounter Neagley - another ex-Military Cop; Froelich, the talented (and attractive) head of the VP's Secret Service detail; Stuvesyant, Froelich's hard-edged boss and a cast of others.  All in all, a pretty interesting lot.  But, simply put, it is the storyline - not the characters - that stand out.<br />Unlike some of Child's previous works, the bad guys remain shrouded in mystery almost throughout.  Tracking their steps along with the Federal Agents, we feel much of the same frustration, indignity, and anger that they feel.  Ultra-competent, the would-be assassins are able to elude the perimeter defenses of the VP on multiple occasions.  The tension mounts as the threats become more and more tangible, affecting other Secret Service employees and finally threatening the lives of the protaganists themselves.<br />Child has done an exceptional job.  If you enjoy thrillers, find \\"Without Fail\\" today and move it to the top of your queue.  Child definitely has not failed with this exceptional novel.	2003-05-24

Singh's masterful work is anything but.  It is exciting, nerve-wracking and  perfectly understandable even to the mathematically challenged.<br />The underlying theme of the book is the incessant battle between those who would create unbreakable codes and those would strive to break them.  His captivating anecdotes describe the historical uses of encrypted messages for purposes of romance, war-making and business... and they are all delightful.<br />It's testament to Singh's ability that even topics such as one-time pad ciphers, the inner workings of the Nazi's Enigma device, the incredibly complicated language of the Navajo code talkers and even quantum cryptology become almost easy to digest.  Throw in bonus topics like the Beale code (a fantastic story!) and the deciphering of heiroglyphics (the Rosetta Stone was not a panacea!) and you have the makings of a truly exceptional work.<br />Singh's work is as unique as it is stellar.  This is one book that anyone interested in history _must_ read.	2003-01-20

The team discovers that far beneath the station, scientists have come across a mysterious object buried in the ice.  The implications of the object are vast and far-reaching, causing other countries who have heard the distress call to send their own special forces teams to investigate.<br />Suffice it to say that all hell breaks loose when various parties converge on the station in the quest to claim the mysterious item.<br />To call \\"Ice Station\\" an 'action-packed thriller' is to do it a disservice.  It is chock-full of gunplay, tactics, astounding rescues and outrageous chase scenes.  In fact, the action is so \\"over the top\\" - and Schofield portrayed in crazily superhuman terms - that only Reilly's attention to detail and command of his subjects salvage the final work.  He covers the details well - and in interesting fashion.  For instance:<br />\\"The two nitrogen charges on the bridge went off.  Supercooled liquid nitrogen blasted out in every direction on C-deck, splattering every SAS commando on the surrounding catwalk.  The results were horrifying.  Nitrogen charges are like no other grenade - for the simple fact that they do not have to penetrate the skin of their victims to kill them...

But Schlosser takes a comprehensive look at the huge business that is fast-food in America.  He describes its history and germination, the growth of the supply-chain behind the scenes, its labor-practices and, in the recently updated afterword, some promising trends.<br />Most disturbing are the supply-chain aspects, specifically the cattle-processing plants that are described as largely unregulated and focused on one objective:  converting as many cattle into hamburger as fast as possible.  The process is described as physically exhausting for workers, hazardous for all involved and, most importantly, very unclean.  The spread of E. Coli and other toxic substances is accelerated in the rush to kill and convert.  The most egregious outbreaks of disease are carefully documented and reveal an ominous trend if left unchecked:  how many new, 'Mad Cow'-style diseases will be created by a system geared towards quantity and not health?<br />Missing from the book are topics like the french-fry oil controversy (beef tallow used when the claim was that it wasn't) and a politically agnostic viewpoint.  Schlosser has an axe to grind with the Republicans when, in truth, both parties have suspect motives when fast-food money is involved.<br />Despite the minor nits, this is an important work and one that should be read by every American.  Or perhaps every American that eats fast-food.  The percentage of Americans that indulge will certainly be declining as news of this timely, updated version of  Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' grows.	2002-11-22

I'm a fan of Chandler, Crumley, DeMille and other practioners of the first-person thriller.

He instantly realizes it could only have been written by his wife.  One problem:  his wife was murdered more than eight years ago.  The ensuing plot twists, action and mayhem which occur are frighteningly well written.  Coben is masterful in his command of the story and his characters.<br />I have but one issue:  Humor.

I was familiar with the famous photograph of the flag-raisers on Mt. Suribachi.  But I had no idea what the battle represented, why it was perhaps the most vicious fight of the entire war and had no clue as to the incredible selflessness of the Marines and Corpsmen who fought, killed and died on an obscure spot of volcanic ash in the Pacific.<br />Bradley was inspired to research and to write about his father, one of the pictured flag-raisers.  The inspiration came, primarily, because of his Father's very reluctance to speak of what occurred on Iwo.  The experiences were so painful, so vivid, that his father spoke but a few words to his son on the subject during his entire lifetime.  Bradley responded to the mystery by researching the lives of all of the flag-raisers, speaking with their families and their comrades-in-arms.<br />The book is excellent because it relies heavily on graphic descriptions of the events by veterans.  The island represented the first piece of territorial Japan to be invaded by the Americans and it was a veritable underground fortress.  It was so heavily fortified that Bradley tells us the final Japanese defenders did not surrender until 1949 - and they emerged from the depths of the island well-fed and -clothed.  The chaotic invasion, the deadly crossfires, the taking of Suribachi and the final sweep across the entire island are brilliantly described by Bradley and the veterans.<br />Iwo served as a air corridor gatekeeper on the way to Tokyo.  The book tells us of the casualty projections that Allied planners arrived at as they drew up the tactics for conquering Japan.  Countless millions of lives on both sides were saved by the A-bombs as Japan had steadfastly refused to surrender and had promised terrible, Iwo-like battles at every turn.<br />In describing the awful nature of battle and the lives of those who fought it, Bradley has performed a service for all of us.  It is an outstanding tribute to all veterans and especially his father.	2002-08-10

This book is really a collection of anecdotes and homages to various friends (coaching mentors Clair Bee, Pete Newell, Henry Iba, Fred Taylor, Red Auerbach and others play prominent roles).  Told in a voice that is sometimes self-deprecating and other times a bit holier-than-thou, Knight is generally entertaining, humorous and extremely intelligent.<br />If you've following RMK's career closely, you will likely enjoy his inside stories.  Even more entertaining is a game you can play while reading the book:  based upon how he describes acquaintances, figuring out who is still on his good side (they'll be mentioned in glowing terms)... and who is persona non grata (they won't be mentioned at all - or dissed in a short paragraph).  Basketball's greatest tactician is easy to read in this regard: he wears his feelings on his sleeve, at least as it pertains to friendships and loyalties.<br />If you're looking for a 'Season on the Brink' (the book, not the lame movie effort) followup, this is not it.  You'd be better off reading Alford's 'Playing for Knight'.  Instead, RMK describes the rich legacy of coaching that Iba, Newell, Bee and others left him.  His friends, both famous and obscure, are credited here - Ted Williams and Bill Parcells are two notables that left lasting impressions.  Just be aware that the the book is a lengthy chronicle of his background, feelings and relationships... the entertainment value of which is not necessarily high, but informative and interesting nonetheless.	2002-05-26

And Jimmy Lerner's foray into writing _is_ exceptional.  Lerner describes himself as a middle-aged, Jewish Dilbert-drone with an MBA, two kids and several addictions.  Convicted of manslaughter charges, he's tossed in the pen with his 'cellie', Kansas, a 6'6\\" powerlifting white supremacist.<br />The story of how Lerner survives - and, to some extent, thrives - in the racially charged modern prison environment is surprising, poignant and - ultimately - very entertaining.  His writing style is simple, elegant stream of consciousness that immediately captures your attention and drives you through the story with no pit stops needed.<br />My main criticism of the book - and the reason I take it down to an 8.4 out of 10 - is Lerner's weak (and, according to other reviews you can find here, fictional) justification for the killing.  While I can't make a judgment as to his veracity, the inclusion of Lerner's relationship with 'the Monster' tainted the story.  It didn't ring true and, worse, wasn't interesting.<br />That being said, I highly recommend it.  If you enjoy Bunker's work - or if the thought of Dilbert surviving prison sounds entertaining - you'll get a charge out of _You Got Nothing Coming_.	2002-05-07

Retired military investigator Paul Brenner is confronted with a trip back to Vietnam in this DeMille mystery and thriller.  A letter written by a Vietnamese soldier during the battle of Hue in '68 has been discovered and it details the grisly murder of an American Lieutenant by another American officer.  His former boss asks him to go investigate - to see if the author is still alive - and to 'resolve the situation'.<br />Knowing he hasn't been given all of the details, but smart enough to fill in many of the blanks, Brenner is more than willing to engage in a cathartic trip back to the venues that so dramatically altered his life during his first two tours of duty.<br />DeMille does a wonderful job describing the modern landscape of Vietnam, where the divide between south and north still exists and the bitter after-effects of war are still tasted on a daily basis.  Saigon, Hue, Dien Bin Phu, Hanoi and the countryside are all described in rich detail.  Those who criticize this book as a travelogue are missing the point.  Where else can one experience - almost firsthand - today's Vietnam viewed through the eyes of a returning veteran?<br />The details of the story are taut and compelling (even hough I would agree many of the elements are a tad predicatable).  It may be a combination mystery and travelogue, but even with its minor shortcomings, DeMille's talents shine through, enlightening, engaging - sometimes startling - and completely absorbing.	2002-05-01

CIA Director Thomas Stansfield has died and Counter-terror head Irene Kennedy is the President's choice to take the reins of the agency.  Standing in their way is the Machiavellian Senator Hank Clark... who, while appearing friendly to their cause, is secretly playing puppet-master, plotting his ouster of Kennedy against a backdrop of scandal and intrigue that will propel him into the White House.<br />To make matter worse for Kennedy, the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad provides the President irrefutable proof that Saddam Hussein is only weeks away from completing his first three nuclear weapons. Taking the WMD's out will prove troublesome, however, as Hussein has positioned the bomb-making factory directly underneath a hospital.<br />Meanwhile, aging CIA operator Mitch Rapp is attempting to build a life of normalcy with his girlfriend, Anna, and desperately wants a way out of the business.  Can Kennedy and Rapp figure out a way to take out the weapons, salvage Kennedy's nomination as CIA director (and, in fact, Ryan's Presidency) and even build a sane life for Rapp and wife-to-be?<br />One can only hope there are more installments of Flynn's fine work.  Kennedy and Rapp are compelling, complementary characters that are among the finest ever created in this genre.	2002-04-06

Herbert Curzon (the title character) is an &quot;old school&quot; cavalry man who is promoted (several times) during World War I and eventually has responsibility for large numbers of land forces: infantry, artillery, etc.<br /> - On a deeper level, I think that this is Forester's &quot;anti-war&quot; tome.  His subtle, yet indelible, criticisms of the bloody trench-war tactics wielded by Generals who believed in honor through sacrifice.  Millions of young lives were sacrificed in useless and ridiculous frontal assaults that benefited only the casket makers.<br />Curzon is a mildly interesting character, consumed with his Generalship and taking only brief moments away from the war.  During one such break, he meets his wife-to-be, the daughter of a Duke.  His in-law peers are none too happy to have their daughter marrying &quot;beneath her&quot;.<br />Without deeply analyzing Curzon's motives - which appear relatively pure - Forester makes it crystal clear that such social climbing had enormous benefits for one's military career.  Curzon is portrayed as an honorable man.  But he is not very bright, nor skilled tactically or strategically.  He is exceptionally dutiful and is filled with a sense of honor at all cost.  It is this belief among the British military leadership that leads to the needless deaths of so many.<br />Curzon learns little during the course of his successful military career.  The same tactics are employed over and over again with dismal results.<br />I rate this book nine out of ten.  If you haven't read Hornblower, you _must_ read the entire series first.  It is not be missed.  If you are already a Forester fan, readthe _General_ for a completely different perspective on combat and the nature of conflict.	2002-02-25

It doesn't matter.  As a stand-alone entry in the pantheon of political and espionage thrillers, it marks Flynn's auspicious debut.  Flynn's abilities are three-fold:  (a) a sense of realism around political and covert ops; (b) a healthy cynicism regarding our political system; and (c) a no-words-wasted approach to giving us glimpses into characters' true personalities.<br />One of my criticisms of Clancy's books is his characters:  drawn with cardboard-thin personalities.  Flynn's characters are sketched more fully, with motivations, human weaknesses and subtle nuances visible and illustrated.<br />If you enjoy espionage and political thrillers - you'll get a kick out of Flynn.	2002-02-06

Not quite as compelling as _Transfer of Power_, _Third Option_ is nonetheless an excellent depiction of two worlds:  the backstage power politics of Washington's Beltway and the brutal, subterranean realm of modern espionage.  Counter-terrorism specialist Mitchell Rapp, an unacknowledged member of a CIA-sponsored black-ops team, is caught in the middle.<br />Rapp is sent to assassinate a German industrialist who has repeatedly gotten into bed with the wrong ally:  Saddam Hussein.  After multiple warnings, the wealthy German businessman has continued to provide Iraq with infrastructure capable of building weapons of mass destruction.  The &quot;hit&quot; takes place, but Rapp is shot by fellow team members in a savage double-cross.<br />The reasons behind the double-cross are complex and described extraordinarily well by Flynn.  His characters include the dying director of the CIA Thomas Stansfield; the counter-terror specialist Irene Kennedy; the President of the U.S.; a leading Senator; a former CIA employee turned mercenary... all are fleshed out well and each becomes an interesting personality.<br />I had some minor bones to pick with the story-telling: Donatella (the beautiful Italian-Israeli assassin) steps off a plane in New York City and then almost immediately reaches into her purse to retrieve a firearm...  Rapp expresses a desire to &quot;get out&quot; of his &quot;Orion Team&quot; role but none of his professional dreams or desires are really described.<br />Nonetheless, these are minor quibbles.  Flynn has crafted a thriller that is well worth reading - perhaps a tad less compelling than _Transfer_, but I would still rate it nine out of ten.  Its realistic depiction of both the political landscape and free-for-all world of modern espionage make it truly interesting.	2002-01-16

He and I are both fans of A.J. Quinnell who I consider to be the top author in the &quot;covert ops fiction&quot; genre.  Well, the genre has another top-shelf author:  Vince Flynn.<br />_Transfer of Power_ is an engaging and realistic depiction of a terrorist attack on the White House.  All the more relevant after the events of 9/11, Flynn is obviously privy to many of the insider details of covert ops and the behind-the-scenes machinations that occur when these sophisticated teams are brought to bear.<br />The story revolves around an extremely intelligent terrorist named Rafik Aziz who exploits the greed of the U.S. political system to arrange a spur-of-the-moment meeting with the President.  Through careful planning he has also inserted a team of terrorists that will help take over the White House at the correct moment.<br />Meanwhile (and through a fortunate coincidence), a U.S. covert ops team led by Mitch Rapp is in the process of kidnapping Aziz' mentor near the coast of Iran.  The kidnapping and subsequent interrogation leads to the startling information that the White House will momentarily come under attack.  With only seconds to spare, the President is warned of the attack and rushed to a secure bunker underneath the Oval Office.<br />Although disappointed, Aziz is prepared for this turn of events and his team takes hostages and secures the perimeter of the White House with high-explosives and a clever fusing system.  He has engaged the services of an Iraqi safe-cracker for just this eventuality; the Iraqi sets to work on opening the bunker and capturing the President.  This will give Aziz the ultimate hostage.<br />With the help of a retired White House employee, a just-returned Rapp is inserted into the White House to report upon the terrorists' activities.  Rapp must determine whether there's a way to save the President, rescue the hostages and capture or kill Aziz... all on a time-linethat is far more compressed than a politically divided U.S. government can imagine.<br />The realism around SEAL Team Six, the FBI's HRT and Delta Force; the brutal political gamesmanship; the diabolical mind of a heartless terrorist; and the very tough (but very human) CIA operator Mitch Rapp combines for a not-to-be-missed thriller.  Flynn has created a work that is at the pinnacle of the genre.  It is simply outstanding.	2001-12-28

I've read just about every book on Knight.  As an IU alum who graduated one of the years that the Hoosiers won a national championship, most of the student body (myself included) - viewed RMK as a demi-God.  Certainly he was blessed with one of the finest basketball minds in history.<br />Berger's book follows in the footsteps of three major works on RMK:  Feinstein's _Season on the Brink_ (the success of which every subsequent effort attempts to duplicate); Mellen's _Bob Knight: His Own Man_ and Alford's _Playing for Knight_.  All three are worth reading (especially _Season_) for the serious &quot;Knight-o-phile&quot;.<br />Berger's book is definitely tabloid in appearance.  Each page seems to have 30 lines of large text on it.  Therefore the book appears as though it could have been printed on 75 pages in a conventional book format.  The sparse text maps directly to the quality of content.  It is sketchy at best.<br />IMO, Berger's heavy reliance upon previously published histories and newspaper articles dooms this work from the outset.  The only area I found remotely interesting was Knight's childhood and schoolboy athletic career.<br />The remainder is a rehash of mostly negative Knight incidents.  Certainly RMK deserves criticism for his histrionics and outrageous behavior that erupts from time to time.  However, Berger mostly omits the litany of his positive and charitable achievements.  More importantly, he never mentions what is certainly one of RMK's most engaging aspects:  his incredible sense of humor.  Knight, when he wants to be, is among the most humorous and quotable characters on the public landscape today.<br />Thumbs down for this vapid attempt to capitalize on the &quot;Knight effect&quot;.  Berger certainly can do better than this.  Instead - read any of the three books mentioned earlier - they're far better uses of your time.	2001-12-20

And I suppose this book doesn't qualify as true SF... it is, instead, alternative history that is written in a plain-spoken, yet truly enlightening style.<br />Set in the year 1632, near the epicenter of the bloody Thirty Years War in Germany, a tiny West Virginia coal town mysteriously appears.  Its population, infrastructure, vehicles and dwellings are intact.  Most importantly for the citizens - some of whom witness a bloody war crime - their modern weapons are functional.<br />The scope of 1632 is daunting - it deals with issues of religion, warfare, nation-building, politics and citizenship - but it does so in an engaging and entirely non-threatening way.  The book is truly exciting and inspirational - not to mention instructive in its explanation of the Thirty Years War and the cast of historical characters that played roles in it.<br />The only minor issue I would take with it are that some of the West Virginian characters come off as too righteous to ever exist in real life.  The author's afterword, in fact, attempts to address this topic - and does so effectively.<br />It's my belief that Robert A. Heinlein would be quite a fan of Flint.  His _Farnham's Freehold_, _Moon is a Harsh Mistress_ and _Starship Troopers_ all are siblings to 1632.  Very well done, Mr. Flint!	2001-12-12

This ingenious novelette was the work of Henry Beard, Doug Kenney and other editors of the Harvard Lampoon just prior to their launch of the ground-breaking National Lampoon magazine.<br />&quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; is, quite simply, the best and funniest work of satire ever written (IMHO :-).  The prologue alone (entitled &quot;Concerning Boggies&quot;, a hysterical attack on Hobbits whom the Lampoon calls Boggies) is worth the price of the book.<br />The attention to satiric detail is amazing and some snippets are needed to do it justice:<br />&quot;It is plain the boggies are relatives of ours, standing somewhere along the evolutionary line that leads from rats to wolverines and eventually to Italians, but what our exact relationship is cannot be told.  Their beginnings lie far back in the Good Old Days when the planet was populated with the kind of colorful creatures you have to drink a quart of Old Overcoat to see nowadays... <br />This was all in the Third, or Sheet-Metal, Age of Lower Middle Earth,...<br />While there was still a King at Ribroast, the Boggies remained nominally his subjects.  And to the last battle at Ribroast with the Slumlord of Borax, they sent some snipers, though who they sided with is unclear.&quot;<br />If you have even the slightest appreciation for Tolkien, this work should reside next to your copy of the trilogy.	2001-11-25

Having read just about all the mob books that are in print (everything from Wise Guy, to Murder Machine, Last Mafioso, etc.), Maloney's book is definitely entertaining and somewhat enlightening.  Other reviewers (below) have challenged Maloney for his truthfulness (which may, in fact, be in question), but many of the details in the book are easily verifiable.  Maloney certainly doesn't overstate his ability to plan criminal operations or choose the right 'crimey' (crime partner)...<br />Two thoughts immediately come to mind:<br />1) Maloney truly was a tough guy.  Surviving ten bullet-holes (including eight at one time) in a series of attempts to fulfill the contract on his life will get you on the &quot;tough guy&quot; list.  Maloney was hooked up with some of the celebrities of &quot;the life&quot; including John Gotti, Jimmy Burke (of Lufthansa and DeNiro/Goodfellas fame), the Coonans and Mickey Featherstone(Westies) and a host of others.<br />2) Maloney was definitely a couple of sandwiches shy of a picnic.  His trust of completely untrustworthy characters, his complete lack of preparation for significant criminal operations, his willingness to attack and kidnap made men... all pointed to, shall we say, a less than gifted intellect.  His continued survival despite this limitation is testament to his toughness and durability.<br />If you enjoy mob books, you'll definitely find &quot;Tough Guy&quot; worth reading.	2001-10-16

Let me preface this review by saying that I am not much of a wrestling fan (I last watched wrestling in the early 80's when Snuka, Muracco, Hogan and others reigned).<br />Foley, at the end of the day, is an intelligent, poised businessman.  Following his dream with a devotion that could be characterized as both maniacal and religous, he parlayed mediocre athletic ability (but a very high tolerance for pain and punishment) into a tremendous career as a &quot;sports entertainer&quot;.<br />One of the biggest surprises I had reading this book is the portrayal of Vince McMahon.  Not that the portrayal was complimentary (considering it was published by the WWF).  Instead, that McMahon is such a savvy manager.  One of McMahon's traits is something of which Jack Welch would approve:  push decision-making to the people best suited for doing so - don't centralize all of the business processes.<br />Foley and his personas (Cactus Jack, Mankind, Dude Love) are able to suggest and create scenarios... craft their own public personalities... and, in general, provide a more interesting environment for the entertainment they provide.  This speaks to the WWF management team's abilities.<br />Another surprise is Foley's honesty.  He really pulls no punches from a personal and professional standpoint.  Other wrestlers are treated fairly but without varnish.  One gets a better appreciation for the athletic abilities, the work ethic and the mental toughness that must accompany any pro wrestler into the ring, night after night.<br />Although the entire book is interesting, I think that it is really useful from the perspective of learning about the wrestling business and business in general.  Empowerment of employees appears to be the gist of the WWF approach.  And it has certainly worked over the last few years.<br />Highly recommended whether you are a wrestling fan or not.  In fact, those who are not fans would probably benefit most from this book.	2000-11-17

Using every motivational tool available to him (from psychological ploys, to unconditional compliments to incredibly painful and stressful drills), Knight drives the '86 Indiana Hoosiers relentlessly through a brutal Big Ten season.<br />With little in the way of athletic talent or height, Knight uses every approach he can devise to extract a moderately successful season from an underwhelming group of players.  Knight coaxes, belittles, praises and drives the team forward with a style that is as unique as it is politically incorrect.<br />As an aside, I just read Jerry Kramer's _Instant Replay_ (his diary of the '67 Packers) and the parallels between Vince Lombardi and Knight are uncanny.  In today's environment, it is unlikely that Lombardi would be allowed to coach in the same style he employed then.<br />Feinstein does a workmanlike job here, letting the subject and the cast of characters do the lion's share of the writing.  Feinstein should thank Knight profusely for putting him on the map.  For, as he has demonstrated in subsequent books, Knight made this book what it is:  a precious historical perspective of a brilliant Coach in a bygone era.	2000-10-08

In the  first work, Dodge seemed to be an eight-ball on a pool table... continually  getting knocked around, yet cunningly figuring out plausible solutions to  seemingly insurmountable troubles.<br />_Low Rider_ is disappointing when  compared with _Bird Dog_.  Dodge no longer seems as interesting and  enigmatic a character (a function of weak plotting and lack of additional  character development, in my opinion only).  The plot centers around the  events that lead to the theft of Dodge's car and his pursuit of its return.   And conceptually, it doesn't get much more complicated than that.<br />The  observation, below, that _Low Rider_ requires familiarity with _Bird Dog_  is accurate.

In the sequel to Quinnell's tour de force _Man On Fire_, no time is wasted in setting the stage for ex-mercenary Creasy's latest project.  His wife and baby happen to be on a flight to the States:   Pan Am 103.<br />Creasy creates a project plan and executes it in sequential,  ever-escalating fashion:  exacting brutal, fitting revenge on the  terrorists and organizations who killed his new family.<br />Quinnell  represents the pinnacle of true-to-life espionage and 'wet work'.  As this  is a pen name, the true identity of AJQ is a mystery to most.  Suffice it  to say, he knows his business.<br />As I wrote in the review for _Man On  Fire_, there is no better author in this genre than Quinnell.  It is tragic  that his books are (mostly) out of print in the U.S.  It has taken many  months to buy his out-of-print and new (via international) books and I've  finally assembled the full collection of Creasy and non-Creasy  stories.<br />All of them are five stars, period.	2000-07-27
US	52913864	R3IJQVKE3127XT	0688071120	674862228	The Challenge	Books	5	5	5	N	N	A masterful, true tale of sailing, discovery and greed	I knew little about the Clipper Ship era (and frankly had minimal desire to learn about it).  I happened upon this book by accident... a fortuitous accident.  Whipple relates the events surrounding the Gold Rush, the  development of the Clipper Ship and the subsequent expansion of trade  routes with the American West.<br />Clipper ships, we learn, were ultra-fast  sailing cargo ships designed to round the tip of South America quickly.  Bringing supplies and trade goods to San Francisco (and, hopefully, plenty  of gold on the return trip), clippers predated both the Panama Canal and  the steam ship.<br />&quot;The Challenge&quot; itself refers to races between  the top clipper ships to make the harrowing trip around the Cape on  ever-faster timing.<br />Included in the edition I have are some astounding  photographs.  My favorite is a stark picture of the Bay... littered with  the hulls of thousands of abandoned ships deserted by crews rushing to the  gold fields.<br />This book is a masterful monument to a fascinating era that  has been largely overlooked.	2000-07-20

Perhaps I didn't understand the true motivation, but  wished there had been a more suitable explanation for his father's  willingness to pawn off his increasingly troubled child to any home that  would have him.<br />I also wished that the book had covered more of Bunker's  life in the last twenty-odd years.  There was no explanation of Bunker  encountering Tarantino or similar events that would seem to be interesting  and unique.  The book effectively ends with Bunker still in prison, being  notified that one of his novels has been accepted by Norton for  publication.<br />Nonetheless, I devoured the entire book in a rush and would  recommend it highly.  It is a worthwhile description of a complex (if  atypical) life.	2000-07-18

The story meanders through the lives of an officially disgraced Starling and an escaped Lecter.<br />Lecter's seemingly unended stream of funding and alternative identities keep him clear of the  authorities.  At the same time, FBI officials hatch a plan to disgrace  Starling.  And Lecter's only surviving victim coincidentally has a vast  fortune at his disposal to attempt the capture of Hannibal.<br />Lecter's  feelings for Starling propel him to aid and assist her.  All of the  components inevitably end up in a vague, disappointing mish-mash of an  ending.<br />Tactically, Harris executes descriptions as well as anyone but  Wolfe.  Strategically, however, _Hannibal_ leaves a lot to be desired.	2000-07-02

It will be interesting to contrast 'Little Boy  Blue' with the non-fictional account of his life.	2000-06-29

As Hemingway said, &quot;no literate person should skip Forester&quot; (or words to that  effect :-).<br />Hornblower's inspired leadership has spurred countless  stories of courage under fire... everything from O'Bryan to Roddenberry's  depiction of Kirk in _Star Trek_ and a host of other action/adventure  stories.<br />My real recommendation is to order all eleven books and to start  with &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot;.  If you have any - even the  slightest - proclivity for action/adventure, you will not stop until  Hornblower does.	2000-06-29

One  gets the sense that this is an autobiographical glimpse at the life of  Eddie Little.  Regardless, it is a brilliantly executed time capsule which  snapshots a troubled youth's charged foray into adulthood.<br />Tremendous  work... highest recommendation.	2000-06-15

This is his first book - and the first featuring Creasy, thequiet, deadly ex-mercenary.  Broken down, alcoholic, Creasy is offereda position as a bodyguard for a wealthy Italian industrialist's adolescent daughter.<br />When the daughter is kidnapped, all hell breaks loose in this novel of redemption and ultimate revenge.<br />There are no better books in this genre.  It is an absolute travesty that any of Quinnell's books are out of print.  All of them are fantastic.  I spent six months buying out-of-print books to get the entire Creasy collection (plus the non-Creasy titles, which are also very, very well done).	2000-04-20

Through a childhood of abject poverty, crime and pain, La Motta harnessed his evil intentions sufficiently (for a time, at least) to win the Middleweight boxing  championship.  When such a title meant something.<br />Covering his rise, fall  and redemption - LaMotta's voice speaks with blatant honesty.  His life has  been indeed been fascinating, painful and poignant.	1999-11-26

Though I had enjoyed 'The Dishwasher', I had held off buying this book due to the descriptions I'd read (**-fightin'?  who cares...).  When I finally convinced myself to buy it, I became a total believer.  Far better  than his earlier works, &quot;In the Hat&quot; has movie material written  all over it.<br />Raw, unremitting and expertly dealt, &quot;In the Hat&quot;  is worth every penny.	1999-10-05

In a manner reminiscent of Edward Bunker, his prose is clean and blunt.  Each twist in  the story is somehow ominous and optimistic; Martin's descriptions of  Malone's emotions are raw and fresh.<br />Very well done and highly  recommended.	1998-11-11

Add up a simplistic plot, an extremely small set of characters, some underdeveloped dialog and you get 'Riding the Rap'.<br />As a fan of Bunker, Leonard, Tarantino, et. al., I was expecting more effort on EL's part. It's almost as if this was written in a few weeks to fulfill some clause in a contract.	1998-09-21

When a 50-ish, overweight, former car salesman named Harold Dodge attempts to assist a ripped-off auto buyer, he unwittingly sets off a chain of events that leads to murder, mayhem, high-dollar crime and (of course) sex.<br />A wonderful first novel that rated a 9 in my list only because the story briefly lagged in a few places.  Reed's _Low Rider_ is next - and it continues the saga in seamless fashion.	1998-08-11
US	52913864	R16UTOVQIMT987	0312961561	822975646	Sleeper Spy	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Sleeper Spy is a winner...	After years of reading spy novels, I had kinda given up on the genre.  My wife bought _Sleeper Spy_ for me (and, honestly, I only read it because I had run out of other reading material).  I was very, very pleasantly surprised.  Safire spins a thoroughly engaging tale of espionage, duplicity, violence and deception - and that's only the part dealing with the media!  The spying game gets even more intense.  One gets the sense that Safire is relating many instances of his real experiences reporting on the inner workings of the beltway.  The genre rarely gets more realistic - or more satisfying.  Well done, Bill!	1998-04-18
