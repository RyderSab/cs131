US	52989182	R1PGIL63AD9EF7	0595296602	785529898	Four Steps To Building A Profitable Coaching Practice: A Complete Marketing Resource Guide for Coaches	Books	5	52	52	N	Y	Complete Marketing Resource for Coaches	*****<br /><br />This book, though short, is succinct and very useful, very rich in content---a great guide for coaches who are wanting to begin marketing their practices. Marketing information is hard to organize, because as a coach, you really just want to know what you need to know to make your practice successful, and not a lot more than that. If you agree with me, this is the book for you.<br /><br />There are lots of resources for coaches who want to delve deeper into any particular type of marketing---for example, running teleclasses---but enough basic information so that you can get started, along with time estimates, cost estimates, and estimates as to how long you would have to do any particular activity before it becomes profitable.<br /><br />I really appreciated the Resource section in the back of the book covering Internet sites for sources from everything from headsets for the telephone, to e-book resources, to credit card merchants and alternatives like PayPal, etc. The Resource section is for the most part specific just to coaching, and the more general resources are useful, too, unlike some appendices.<br /><br />There are assignments throughout the book for those people who enjoy exercises to assist you in actually DOING the things you need to do to market your practice. The assignments seemed good, but am using the book as a sourcebook to help me to brainstorm, so I just read over them for ideas. I cannot imagine anyone going through and doing these exercises, though, and by the end of the book NOT having a thriving practice.<br /><br />This is definitely the best book I have ever read on marketing for coaches! I can't imagine how it could have been written any better or how it could have been any more helpful unless the author did the marketing FOR me :)<br /><br />*****	2005-10-04

It is a small book, but with 101 concrete definite tools for \\"energy building\\"---you can choose to make  small, very do-able changes in your life, take baby steps, and end up with a lot more energy than you could even imagine.<br /><br />I am a life coach, so I know all of this (all of the things to do), have all the books, etc.  What I found valuable in this book was not necessarily brand new information (although there was even some of that!) but its succinctness, and organization---thus you have everything all in one place and can go through (sort of like a menu in a restaurant) and choose the actions you'd like to do right now.  Eventually, momentum takes over, and you feel more and more energetic, and ready to take on more and more actions.<br /><br />One new thing I learned that was very interesting is that there is a big difference at night between getting 7 hours of sleep and 8 hours of sleep.  New research has shown that the REM sleep you get between the 7th and 8th hour of sleep is absolutely critical to feeling rested and to the body repairing itself.  So this is why I feel SO much better on those days when I get 8 hours sleep than 6 hours...<br /><br />The chapters are short (a page or two) and I enjoyed the format, so I read the whole book injust a few hours.  I marked all of the changes I want to start with and will refer back to the book again and again.  It's very practical and not just old ideas rehashed, not leaving you feel like you \\"should\\" make the changes, but that it's just too overwhelming to do so; instead, the author shows you HOW to begin and continue.<br /><br />The book covers physical, mental, and spiritual approaches, how to create rituals to support your new habits, and how to get rid of \\"energy vampires\\", habits that suck your energy.  It is easy to see how working to build your energy, while working to eliminate energy vampires at the same time---this could create almost a vortex of energy so that you'd feel better and much more energetic right away.  I know that other books might promise to help with this, but the practicality of this one works.<br /><br />So even though I consider myself very experienced in the self-help arena, this is a valuable book.  It is great for novices, too, for the person who would love to have a life coach or personal trainer, but who is just too busy or too tired to even think about it.  This book delivers value for pretty much anyone.  I am buying a copy for my husband (because I want to keep mine just for me), and for three friends!<br /><br />*****\\", habits that suck your energy.

There is enough information in the book to get started with Sudoku, even if you are a complete novice to puzzles, like me.<br /><br />There are ten pages of instructions and strategy.  They are pretty easy, enough to get started with no background at all.  After I read it I wondered if I'd actually have fun doing Sudoku, so I did the first puzzle.  It took me about 90 minutes, and it was REALLY fun.  Sudoku is based upon logic.  If you enjoy thinking and figuring things out, and enjoy numbers, you'll love it!<br /><br />Sudoku is hard to describe in a few sentences, but basically a puzzle consists of a 3X3 square with a 3X3 square inside each of the 9 squares---81 little \\"cells\\" in all, 9 down and 9 across.  Imagine a large grid---that's what the puzzle looks like. The object is to place the digits 1 through 9 only once in each of the small 3X3 squares (of which there are 9).  At the same time you must have unique digits going across all of the \\"cells\\" and unique digits going down all of the \\"cells\\".<br /><br />I think that now that I've gotten the hang of things (I had to go back and reread parts of the instructions,too), I could do a puzzle in 30-60 minutes as a novice.  I expect to get better each time and have a short learning curve.<br /><br />There are 32 gentle puzzles, 66 moderate puzzles, and 34 tough puzzles, more than enough to make the book a great value.<br /><br />I am going to have to pace myself so that I don't get addicted and ignore my responsibilities :)<br /><br />*****	2005-08-03

It is large, chock full of information of the positive sort (as opposed to of the negative sort).  This is because \\"pronoia\\" is the opposite of \\"paranoid\\" (when you think everyone is out to get you)---you think every is out to shower you with blessings!  The book is written to celebrate pronoia is a variety of ways, all of which make you feel good.<br /><br />The author, Rob Brezskny, writes in a lyrical, irreverant, wildly unconventional and beautiful style.  I've never seen anyone else write like that---he is unique.  The book sort of reminds me in a way of Ram Dass' \\"Be Here Now\\", a cult classic, and an amazing consciousness book of the time that is still in print today.  I think that Pronoia will be as popular as that classic book.<br /><br />Pronoia is an experience, not just a book.  And you can GET the experience from just reading the book!  It can be read linearly, or bit by bit from time to time, with equally good results.  There are many interactive sections, provocative questions, exercises to try, ideas for journalling, etc. throughout the book.  These interactive things aren't traditional exercises you'd find in a \\"normal\\" book, though.  They are wild, wacky, and wonderful---just like the book!<br /><br />The book is quite irreverent, yet it beautifully captures the God I worship in its pages---not the God of any one religion, but of all of us.  He thinks up interesting new names for this supreme being like \\"the Divine Wow\\"...and you experience the love of this higher power throughout the book, not in ways you'd expect.  There is much humor throughout too---it is a laugh-out loud kind of book.<br /><br />If you are open, even just a little bit, to the experience that the whole world COULD be conspiring to shower you with love and blessing---or if you'd LIKE to be open to this possibility---then this is a book, and an experience for you.  If you are a negative, pessimistic person, or if you are depressed, or if you are just searching for more meaning and happiness in your life---AND---you read this entire book, I will bet that you will be much more ready, if not entirely ready, to live your life quite differently in various ways.<br /><br />Pronoia is a great value too---lots of book, lots of experience---for a really great price. If you're wondering if you should get it, the answer is yes! I know it looks odd and is different, but take the chance and you won't be sorry!  I am buying 5 more copies to give to my closest friends...one of the best and most life-changing books I've read.<br />*****, or if you are just searching for more meaning and happiness in your life---AND---you read this entire book, I will bet that you will be much more ready, if not entirely ready, to live your life quite differently in various ways.

This book is one of the latter (so I read it cover to cover), as I am a life coach who knew very little about blogs (just having read some teen Xangas).  I had seen a very powerful blog-based web site on the Internet, and knew I wanted one for my coaching practice, but had no idea where to begin or what or where the \\"blogosphere\\" was.  This book solved my dilemma in a fun, readable, and non-technical way (with many, many references for those who want to go deeper).  It is definitely a five-star Dummies book, well worth more than the purchase price.<br /><br />This book helped me to decide what type of blog to develop.  I have rudimentary HTML skills, including lite CSS; however, no matter what your skill level (or lack thereof), using the book you can ascertain what type of blog is right for you.<br /><br />It really covers everything you'd want to know about blogs, including those things you'd never know to ask (e.g., RSS feeds!---who knew?).  Not just the technical aspects, but blog writing, marketing, etiquette, etc.  I agree with a previous reviewer who wrote that the book is also beneficial for those who want simply personal blogs rather than business blogs, although its greatest utility is for people like me who want to use a blog as a basis for or as an adjunct to their business.<br /><br />The book was fascinating.  Although I spend a lot of time on the Internet, I was oblivious to blogs, and discovered a whole new and very exciting world here.  The book helps you to get fired up and excited about something technical---which for me isn't easy, since I don't normally get emotional over new computer software.  I think the reason I'm so motivated is that the book helped me to see that so very, very much that is not technical (building community, reaching people in a personal way, supporting clients, offering services, and much more) can be done with blogs.<br /><br />Best of all is that this book showed me how I can market using blogs and still be myself, something I've been trying to do for years.  In fact, the more I am myself on a blog, the better the blog will be---imagine that!  A blog is a great tool for self-expression, which can be done concurrently with marketing, I found out, and in an authentic way.<br /><br />The book gives references for further learning, which is mostly informal (an therefore hard to know about without experience, which the author shared to my great benefit).  If you are an early adopter, buy the book now---you won't be sorry.  In a few years, everyone will blog---now, you can be on the cutting edge...I wish I could give this book 6 stars!<br /><br />*****n a personal way, supporting clients, offering services, and much more) can be done with blogs.   <br /> <br />Best of all is that this book showed me how I can market using blogs and still be myself, something I've been trying to do for years.

I enjoyed it too, though, because I feel that it will prepare me should I ever be in this situation.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that men who cheat follow a predictable Script, and that they always have followed this Script throughout history, always telling women the same things in order to relieve themselves of guilt and make themselves look good.  Men will do most anything to make themselves look good and come out on top, even things that would be out of character for them when they were married and devoted---I agree with this assertion from the book (based on my own personal experience).<br /><br />While it's true that this book is not based upon scientific studies, it is based upon anecdotal experience that every woman is familiar with if she has ever had a friend, sister, or mother who has been betrayed by their spouse.  I think the book is incredibly valuable because it helps the betrayed woman not feel alone, not feel like she is \\"unstable\\" or going crazy, not feel like it's all her problem.<br /><br />If you know of someone who is trying to survive betrayal and/or divorce by a cheating husband, or if you even suspect this, it would be a great book for both you and for her.<br /><br />****	2005-06-27

It is different from other books because of its authors, Maria and Maya Rodale, of Rodale Press fame.  The mother and daughter perspective was especially intriguing to me.  Both women share their experiences along their journey to find out who they are as individuals, and as self-defined \\"pleasure revolutionaries\\".  They interweave the book with fun exercises, stories of famous \\"pleasure revolutionaries\\", historical details, and much more.<br /><br />The book brings in many unconventional ideas, such as reading romance novels, exploring non-traditional religions, traveling alone, and the like.  While I would not necessarily follow the paths these two women did in any particular area, I felt like the book gave me permission to venture out and try some things I would not ordinarily try.  I have to admit that after all of their positive experiences with romance novels, I am considering even giving them a try, too.<br /><br />One reviewer said there was not a lot of substance to this book, and I really disagree.  It is full of resources for exploring \\"pleasure\\" in your own life (including Internet sites, lists, books, etc.), and a great guide.  It is entertaining and fun to boot. It's the type of book that would be interesting for girlfriends to read (I'm loaning my copy to my best friend) or even better, for a woman's book club!<br /><br />One caveat:  If you are pretty straight-laced, you might find some things too adventurous here---like some of the erotic Internet sites or discussions of sexual toys, etc.---I did not find anything offensive however---all was in good taste.  I'm the type of person who feels comfortable taking what fits and not worrying about the rest...if you're not that way, this might not be the best choice for you...if you are, read and enjoy!!<br /><br />****	2005-06-11
US	52989182	R2MMCEFKQWE6JB	0898249716	161717275	Missouri Mystic	Books	4	14	14	N	Y	Fine spiritual autobiography	****<br /><br />I enjoyed Karen Bentley's review (above) of Jon Mundy's \\"Missouri Mystic\\"---it is comprehensive and there is not a lot that I can add to it.  I just finished reading Missouri Mystic, and although I did enjoy it for the most part, I only gave it four stars because I'm not sure that everyone will enjoy it as much as she did.<br /><br />It is pretty much all that she describes it to be, a candid and revealing spiritual autobiography of an authentic and admirable man.  Jon Mundy is very highly regarded in the \\"Course in Miracles\\" community as an esteemed spiritual teacher.  His experiences are diverse and interesting to read about.<br /><br />That said, certain things about the book made it hard for me to get through.  The author's writing style is in the present tense, even when he is talking about the past.  I have not encountered this type of literary device before, and found it a bit distracting.<br /><br />Another thing that was hard about the book was that there was a lot of detail; some of this detail enhanced the book, I thought, like the detail about his spiritual experiences.  Much of the rest of the detail about the events of his life that were not as pertinent to his spiritual journey seemed tedious to me.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is an excellent book, and one that anyone interested in people's spiritual journeys would find worthwhile.  I do not think you need to be a student of \\"A Course in Miracles\\" either, to benefit from reading it.  I was glad I read it.  I feel like I received benefit from knowing more about a humble and  honest man.<br /><br />****	2005-06-08

Specifically, it is about embracing fear---facing fear---rather than running from it, stuffing it, etc.  Unlike most self-help books, the author does not presume to be an authority with easy answers; instead, he is a fellow human being who struggles with his own fear and that of his clients.  He shares very practical techniques to approach your fears so that you can still have the life you want, regardless of your fears.<br /><br />Fear underlies most if all negative emotions.  I found this book to be very helpful.  The author asks many helpful questions such as \\"What would I do today if I were brave?\\"...leading me to see where my fears stopped me.<br /><br />Another technique he uses is splitting our self-talk into the negative voices of unhealthy unnecessary fear (which he calls The Bully) and the positive voices of what we know with our heads and hearts (which he calls The Ally).  This has been really helpful to me, too.  He makes the point that we will never rid ourselves of fear, but we will be less and less bothered by it as we learn how to face it.<br /><br />This book differs from an ordinary self-help book in that it is amazingly useful, plus the author is practical, transparent, realistic, and humble.  I loved reading it, highlighted it all over the place, and will read it again.<br /><br />It is an excellent value and worth hours of therapy.  I would even suggest it in lieu of therapy!  I immediately bought two copies to send to two of my closest friends.<br /><br />*****	2005-04-08

I enjoyed the format and the author's writing style.  I had previously tried to read other books, including the text of A Course In Miracles itself, and found them very technical and hard to understand.<br /><br />Many people would define this book as \\"New Age\\".  I found it to be pretty down to earth, describing a philosophy or a way of thinking that could be used in whole or in part no matter what your religious beliefs.  The author asks you to merely consider the ideas she presents, to try them on and see if they ring true for you and fit what you want for your life.<br /><br />The book is only just over 100 pages, but it really is a great introduction. The back of the book includes web sites for ACIM and a list of recommended ACIM authors and their books.<br /><br />I may adopt some of the ACIM ways of thinking...or I may not...but I can tell you that I felt sooo good, sooo calm and peaceful and filled with an experience of God's love for me after reading this book.  I read it two days ago, underlined and highlighted much of it, and then read it again really slowly today, just to let it sink in deeper.<br /><br />If you are a seeker looking to explore a different way of thinking than what you currently have, you will probably like it.  If you aren't really open to new ideas, then the \\"10 Radiant Ideas\\" won't be too attractive to you.  Nevertheless, I think it's a great book, and the author succeeded at her goal:  to explain ACIM to someone totally unfamiliar with it, and to do it in a way that gives the reader a real sense of what it might be like to believe in this way.<br /><br />*****	2005-03-19

It is about the author's life, which involved a lot of dysfunction and abuse, and this in itself is a controversial topic.  It is also about the Mormon Church.  The author has now left the Mormon Church, and people have widely divergent views on her leaving and on the Church itself.<br /><br />I thought that the book was very fair to the Mormon Church.  I disagree with the reviewers who think that the author reviles and disparages the Church.  I think that she writes in a fair way, and although much of it is not flattering, much of it is flattering, too---it is simply her experience.  I think that the author goes to great effort to make the point that she is writing about what she knows and what her experiences were.<br /><br />That said, this is an unforgettable book.  If it were just about Martha Beck's life, that alone would make for a riveting read.  However, the details about the Mormon Church are so interesting, too.  I could not put the book down.  I read it in two days because I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.<br /><br />It is a very, very brave, poignant, well-written book...Martha is a very intelligent woman who writes about her experiences in such a vivid way that you feel like you are going through them with her.  The part of her life that she writes about in this book is her journey of faith, and I loved it.  She uses vivid metaphors and great \\"laugh-out-loud\\" wit.  She is entertaining, too...although much of the book is painful.  That in itself was pretty incredible to me---that someone could write a book with so much pain and laughter and depth all at the same time.  The book is so interesting that I think people who are not interested at all in the LDS Church would still enjoy it---to me, this is one sign of a really well-written book---when you can pick it up and be totally absorbed in something that on the surface you have no interest in whatsoever.<br /><br />The book is structured around a meeting Martha has with her father.  Each chapter covers a few minutes of their meeting, and then flashes back to relevant experiences in her past.  She ties her experiences with her family and with her church in with her journey of faith.<br /><br />I think that some Mormons may be very upset that the author dares to criticize their church or their leaders in any way.  However, I think other Mormons will welcome her views and experiences and think about them as a part of their journey of faith too.  If you are not a Mormon, I think you'll love it like I did.<br /><br />Some reviewers criticize the book because of what the author's family members believe and feel about it.  When you read the book, you'll see why you couldn't expect them to all jump in and endorse what happened to Martha and what she found out.  Don't let the negative reviews scare you off---just read the book and make up your own mind---it's really worth it.  I bought it in hardback and my husband is now reading it and loving it too, so it's not just a \\"woman's book\\".

It is extremely personal; she says that she has shared personal stories from her life more in workshops than in her books in the past. This one is very honest and transparent---and all about grace.<br /><br />I think that she wrote this book to wake the reader up to the presence of grace in all of our lives---grace from a Higher Power.  She manages to write the book outside of religious traditions, so that whatever your religious beliefs, I think you will find that the concepts can be easily applied without offending.  Cheryl's own spiritual path as an adult began with Al-Anon, and continued through different spiritual groups and orientations, some of them Eastern.  I found that her experiences in Al-Anon were representative of spiritual awakening in general, no matter where it happens.  She found much richness in various Eastern groups, but again, the concepts are universal.  It seems that she takes great pains to make the book open and accepting for people of all or even no faith.<br /><br />I think that a person who believed in any Higher Power would find much about grace, mindfulness, silence, forgiveness, etc. to apply to their life.  If you are a strong believer of any faith at all it will strengthen your faith.  Also, though, if you are a reader who has no faith in any Higher Power whatsoever, I can imagine that you would still appreciate the author's journey as good food for thought.<br /><br />Throughout the book there are very short and simple exercises (mostly ponderings on thoughts and questions) to enable the reader to have an encounter on some level with grace.  I think that's the best part of the book---that it delivers to the reader a profound  experience of a sometimes illusive spiritual concept.  This is not just a book ABOUT grace.  When you finish the book, you will have EXPERIENCED grace.  For this reason, I think the book really delivers.<br /><br />When I first ordered it from Amazon, I was a little disappointed in the price for the much lower quality paper and printing (although it is a hardback book, the paper inside is mass market paper).

Jon Kabat-Zinn delivers...	*****<br /><br />This book woke me up, literally.  \\"Coming to Our Senses\\" is a large, long, and for me---difficult, book about mindfulness.  That said, it is well worth the read.  The experience of reading this book was an awakening for me to the world outside my head, where I live most of my life, and where I suspect most of us live our lives.  I don't think how I can explain HOW this happens, either, but I know it does.<br /><br />I started reading it on vacation in Hawaii on my balcony outside, and slowly but gradually I became aware of the environment all around me----the sounds, the smells---and the environment within me---my aches and pains, my feelings, bodily sensations, etc.  It was a new experience for me.  It was really exciting to have it happen on vacation in Hawaii.  I would think though, that wherever you are, if you make the time for the adventure of reading this book, and stick with it, you will have this same \\"awakening\\" experience.<br /><br />Much of the book is about meditation as well as mindfulness, the author's own experiences, and his reflections on our society.  He also writes about conventional medicine and how it is beginning to utilize mindfulness.  Jon Kabat-Zinn is a fine writer, and though the book is a tome, it is SO worth it.  He got me excited about meditation, whereas other books have not.  I am a Type A person, so I get anxious at just the thought of sitting around doing nothing for even a few minutes (or seconds); however, the author describes the incredible benefits to be delivered from a simple meditation practice after only several weeks of daily effort, so for me this would be well worth it.  It gives you enough information to get started (you apparently really don't need that much), but the author also has references, further reading lists, web site lists, and his own CDs and resources (which he doesn't push but simply offers).  After spending almost 700 wonderful pages with him, I trust the author and feel very privileged to have read his book.<br /><br />The writing style of the book is scientific, philosophical, and grounded, not \\"new age\\" at all, another aspect I appreciated.  I would encourage you to buy it and read it if you enjoy reading AND thinking, and if you're intrigued at all by the subject matter.  I haven't read any of his other books, so I don't know how this one compares.  I truly am baffled by previous reviewers who were \\"disappointed\\"; in this book, the author definitely delivers! It is a gorgeous hardback book with rough-cut edges (and it smells great too)---well worth the retail price (unlike many hardback books) let alone Amazon's discounted price.<br /><br />*****have read his book.   <br /> <br />The writing style of the book is scientific, philosophical, and grounded, not \\"new age\\" at all, another aspect I appreciated.

It is about the author's childhood in Alabama, about poverty, abuse, and alcoholism, but even more it is about love, family, and what is \\"normal\\".  Despite the dark subject it is not a depressing book, but rather, a book of hope and love.  I cannot imagine anyone having had a more troubled or abusive childhood than did the author, but the central theme of family love is what, most affects the family members and holds them together above all.<br /><br />When you finish the book, you are really sorry, as you hate to see it end.  Fortunately it continues with a second memoir about the author's life as an adult called \\"Fierce\\".  Both are worth purchasing in hardback and rereading throughout your life; they are not books to be read once and then donated to a book sale.<br /><br />It is not simply well-written, but it is so moving, honest, and matter-of-fact, that you really feel like you know and love all of the real people in the author's life.  When I read \\"Alice\\"'s review (see above...Alice is the author's sister) I was so moved because I feel like I \\"know\\" her from the memoir.  Of course I don't, but the memoir was that real.<br /><br />I read this book as slowly as I could to make it last. It was just so good. I can't imagine anyone buying it and thinking they didn't get more than their money's worth, as it delivers on all levels---style of writing, suspense and plot, authenticity and transparency, the ability to draw you into the author's world.<br /><br />\\"Fierce\\" takes place mostly after the author is an adult and leaves home although there are many flashbacks to childhood. \\"Change Me Into Zeus' Daughter\\" is about the author's childhood. I would buy both books together in hardback and save them forever to be read again and again.<br /><br />*****	2005-01-09

Although it could easily be read alone, I found it was an incredible experience to read it after reading the earlier memoir.  Knowing the background of the author's childhood from the first book adds richness to the already rich second memoir \\"Fierce\\".<br /><br />Although both books describe very difficult life experiences, they are far from depressing; they are about the triumph of love and the human spirit.

It is a nice-sized book (about 7 X 7 and almost and inch and a half thick) full of gorgeous pictures, quotes, facts, and fillers about golf---and why so many men and women love it.  If you love golf, you will undoubtably enjoy it.  If you WONDER why people love golf, you will discover it with this book.  I do not golf, but I enjoyed the book so much; I would expect that others would do who don't play, and that it could give them an appreciation for this wonderful sport.<br /><br />I received it in the mail yesterday and spent several hours reading the whole book all at once today---I didn't want to put it down.  I look forward to reading it again and again.  The parts I enjoyed the most were the exerpts from old golf books about the sport, written in exquisite language.<br /><br />The beauty of the book makes it well worth the full price.  However, it is a great buy used too (which is how I got it).<br /><br />*****	2004-10-06

It pokes fun at male chauvinists on the golf course.  It is about the length of an essay, can be read in about thirty minutes or so, and is amusing.  It offers some advice on how to deal with difficult situations on the golf course, which is really mostly the author's perspective; some of her techniques I would use, and some are more abrasive.  It is a little dated (1994) and women are now a bit more accepted on the golf course; howevever, many attitudes still have not changed, of course.  Overall, it would be a worthwhile purchase, as long as you understand that it is not really a full length book.<br /><br />****	2004-09-27

In such a format, it is impossible to cover all of the basics and fundamentals of the golf culture to help a woman feel comfortable her first time on the golf course.  That said, this book is a good attempt.  If you only have a couple of hours to prepare, and you want to feel as comfortable as possible, I would recommend this book to very new women golfers. It includes a little bit of everything:  terminology, culture, etiquette, rules, logistics and practicalities, how to dress, lingo, etc.  It also includes some very helpful things that I personally liked:  an actual scorecard with the different parts explained, a picture of the different irons, and a chart of hints for \\"picking up the pace\\" on the course.  It is only 69 pages long so there is only so much that fits, but if you're busy, and you need a CRASH course to get ready, this is your book.<br /><br />****	2004-09-27

I read it because I enjoy the M. Scott Peck's other work. I found that it excited me about golf at whatever level I end up being involved with it in the future---as a spectator, as a friend of a golfer, or even as a player someday.<br /><br />As a golfer's adult daughter, I confess that in the past I have thought that golf was just a \\"silly rich man's game\\" done for the amusement of those who have nothing better to do.  This book blew apart my misconception that was, frankly, based on a total ignorance of the game.  This book explains the connection between golf and life, the mysticism involved in the game, and how golf can be a great game just in itself, and too, as so much more.<br /><br />M. Scott Peck uses his design of a fantasy golf course called Exotica as a literary device to muse about what he has learned from many years of playing.  He starts with the first hole, describes it, and writes related things about golfing and life and relationships and mysticism.  As he goes, he explains the game so that people like me who have no idea about golf terminology can follow and appreciate what he is saying.  He brings in a religious focus too at times, but an intensely personal one (he is a Christian and calls God \\"Her\\"), so that each reader can evaluate his religious ponderings in light of their own religious beliefs and see what would hold true for them.<br /><br />This is not a book about golf tips or instruction, although there is some of this that is really interesting; it is a unique view of golf through the eyes of a long-time golfer that I admire.  He is not an especially good golfer (although dedicated) and he is older (60's), too; I loved this perspective as it is where I will be if I do indeed learn to golf!  I have learned much from the author in this book, and am eager to become more involved in the world of golf (which surprises me greatly)!<br /><br />One thing I have already done is bought the book used on audio tape from Amazon to listen to, and am looking to hearing it all again---it's that type of book---I expect to get even more out of it the second time around.<br /><br />If you are considering taking up golf, or wonder why people play it and think of yourself as just not that type...perhaps you are even a \\"golf widow\\" or golfer's adult child...then this is a great book, especially if you are spiritually or intellectually oriented, or if you like Peck's other work.<br /><br />*****ready done is bought the book used on audio tape from Amazon to listen to, and am looking to hearing it all again---it's that type of book---I expect to get even more out of it the second time around. <br /> <br />If you are considering taking up golf, or wonder why people play it and think of yourself as just not that type...perhaps you are even a \\"golf widow\\" or golfer's adult child...then this is a great book, especially if you are spiritually or intellectually oriented, or if you like Peck's other work.   <br />*****	2004-09-20

It is fact-based and fascinating.<br /><br />One important premise of the book is that much of the controversy surrounding John Kerry's military record could be very quickly cleared up if he would simply release his military records in their entirety to the public, which he has thus far (for some unknown reason) refused to do.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who really wants to know the facts before they decide their opinion.<br /><br />No matter how Kerry fares in the upcoming election, this book will have historical significance in that it documents the experience of the vast majority of the Swift Boat veterans---at gross variance with John Kerry's testimony.  Until he sets the record straight one way or another by releasing his records, all we have to go on are what he says (supported by several Swiftees) versus what the majority of the Swiftees say (contained in this book).  This book is the testimony of the Swiftees, and it is vital to read to understand our country today and its history with respect to Vietnam.<br /><br />It includes a photo of John Kerry in a Communist museum, lauding the important contributions he made in his anti-war efforts--for which he is considered a great hero in the eyes of the North Vietnamese.  Pretty amazing!<br /><br />*****	2004-08-30

The Rage of the Left, the Truth, and What to Do About It	Books	5	23	37	N	N	Great book for those who are proud to be Americans	*****<br /><br />Reading the reviews, it seems that if you are conservative you will like this book, as I did; if you are liberal you will probably not like it and think it biased.<br /><br />I read many books about current events, and enjoyed \\"Can America Survive?\\" because it used facts that can be verified to make the authors' points.  It was entertaining, interesting, and will foster pride in America in those who read it, if they are open to having such pride fostered. I am, and I loved it!<br /><br />Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the book offered intriguing insights into why those on the left are so angry.  The reasons are not too flattering, so they probably wouldn't be appreciated by those folks who are already pretty enraged.  To be fair, the author contrasts psychological insights about the left with those of the right, and they are not the most flattering either.  In my experience, however, they rang true, though, and I did agree with the authors.<br /><br />This would be a great book for those who love America and who are looking for even more reasons to love her.  It would also be good for those who are discouraged and who wonder if there is hope for Americaa's survival as a free and good country.  If you are a reader who thinks America is not free and not good, you probably are not going to like the book--it will just make you angrier and I would suggest you pass on it.<br /><br />****	2004-08-29

It is a well-written, entertaining, and a very REAL novel that will appeal to Christians and non-Christians alike.  The novel is written from the perspective of a single black Christian woman.  Although I am married and white, I loved every moment of reading it and identified with the protagonist.  As she discovers her prejudice against white people, I found myself discovering how I too am prejudiced towards different types of people, and how, if we are Christians, this is not truly being Christ-like.<br /><br />The book helped me to understand the African American culture more, and to see why, understandably, many black people grow up in modern times disliking white people.  I never really understood this before...the author helped you to really feel for the characters and to see how they developed their feelings and beliefs.<br /><br />I am not a reader of romance novels because I do not enjoy them, but the story was still very appealing to me.  It was a romance in a way, but even more was a story about how trust develops between two people.  This I found fascinating.<br /><br />The characters were not perfect, but very real--saying, doing, and thinking things common to us all--but things we may not always want to own up to.  In this way, the novel was very honest.<br /><br />The story included real people praying and living authentic Christian lives.  However, this was done in a way that I could not imagine it offending people who were not Christians. It might give people of other faiths or people not interested in any faith insight into how real Christians live and think and behave.  I have read books featuring characters of other faiths that presented them in this way and thoroughly enjoyed them; I think others would enjoy \\"Boaz Brown\\" in the same way.<br /><br />I am so glad I purchased this book in hardback, and feel like it is well worth the money to do so.<br /><br />*****	2004-08-25

It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. I would not call it an easy read, because it was some work to keep track of all of the different characters, but nevertheless, so very well worth it. Despite the work, it was entertaining. Like other reviewers, it kept me up at night, and kept me reading.<br /><br />The book caused me to wonder how I would behave had I the same cultural background as the various characters in the book---the white slave owners, black slave owners, the black slaves. I had always thought before that I \\"of course\\" would be against slavery, would fight for rights for all races, and absolutely never do anything so repulsive as to own slaves. I wondered how anyone ever could! The Known World opened my eyes to how this could happen, and how easily one of those slaveowners---black or white---could have been me. Or how easily I could have been a slave. It also provided insight into the psychological world of the slave. All of this was done by showing, not telling, so the reading was more of a powerful emotional experience rather than an intellectual experience.<br /><br />What made this so different for me is that I picked this book soley upon the Amazon reviews and rankings. I had no inherent interest in American history or race relations or the Civil War era, but this book GOT me interested. I think that the only person who would not enjoy this book would be the person who is not open or interested in challenging themselves, not interested in thinking, or afraid to find out about or explore the dark side of the human experience.<br /><br />Because of the complexity of the book, as far as the feelings of the characters, the layers of meaning, and the strong impact, I know that I will read this book again and again, and am therefore glad that I spent the money to get it in hardback. It is well worth the money, and is a beautiful \\"rough cut\\" book. I have thought about its message again and again since reading it; I would call it haunting, thought-provoking, disturbing, and honest.<br /><br />*****have thought about its message again and again since reading it; I would call it haunting, thought-provoking, disturbing, and honest. <br />***** <br />	2004-08-15

The author maintains that 80% of all illnesses have spiritual roots; if you restrict this to chronic illnesses, which allopathic medicine has little successs with, I would agree with him.<br /><br /> The book seems like it is a long transcription of a seminar that the author, a pastor, gives, and although it seems to ramble at times, I found everything in it useful and practical. I was greatly inspired by his digressions. He makes it clear that his very successful ministry (especially to people with MCS/EI) is in its embryonic stage, and that there is much more to learn in this area. He is very honest and straightforward.<br /><br /> The whole book is very Bible-based. It answers the question, &quot;What if everything in the Bible WERE really true and for today, especially about healing?&quot;...I know that might sound like it's a &quot;name it and claim it&quot; book (but it's not) or like it's a book that puts people down who get prayer but don't get instantly healed (but it's not). Instead it's a book that deals with WHY people might not be healed and practically WHAT they can do from a spiritual perspective. I do not feel condemned or put down because I have not yet been fully healed; instead I feel excited about the spiritual healing the Lord is doing and will continue to do...and so at peace about the physical manifestations and the symptoms and the pain I currently have. I look so forward to continuing to follow the healing steps of the &quot;walk out&quot; and to the work that the Lord is doing in my life because of this book.<br /><br /> The end of the book is filled with pages of testimonies (including very detailed MCS/EI testimonies) that are incredibly uplifting, even for people without this particular illness.<br /><br /> If you are ill, discouraged because you've received prayer but are not yet healed, need encouragement or uplifting, I strongly recommend this book.

For me, it provided the key to my problems---too much exposure to environments and people that drain my energy and not enough thought, planning, and assertiveness in setting things up so that I can acccomplish what I need to and want to with my life.  I would recommend it highly for anyone who is anxious, depressed, tired, bored---in general, for anyone who would like a program of practical exercises to create more energy in their life.<br />I like the way the exercises are presented (I usually don't like exercises in self-help books and skip them).  They are set off with shading, short, and not bothersome or time-consuming to do.  If you are already worn out and tired the last thing you want is more \\"exercises\\" to do. Dr. Orloff's exercises are relaxing and add to your life rather than take away.<br />The book is enjoyable and relaxing to read.  I would feel \\"up\\" and inspired after reading even a small part.  This is the type of book that needs to be digested and re-read, not to grasp the information, but to remind yourself of important truths until they become a part of your life.<br />Dr. Orloff is an M.D., very knowledgeable, and a Buddhist as well.  I found her spiritual orientation helpful and not offensive, although I am a Christian.  The book discusses energy, meridians, and chakras in a practical down-to-earth way, assuming no previous exposure to these ideas and not incorporating popular New Age or woo-woo ideas as many books do.  Her scientific orientation would be helpful, I would think, to people of any spiritual orientation or background.<br />Positive Energy provided just the information I needed at the right time.  I went through the book, reviewing what I'd highlighted and came up with my own customized plan that I typed up and printed out to distill and emphasize parts that were especially helpful to me; I plan to read and follow this daily.

I would recommend it for those who would like to be uplifted while they are entertained.  It is a peaceful and satisfying book too.<br />The perspective of small town life from Renato is enjoyable.  I have often wondered how and why someone would live their entire life in one place, avoid the change and almost designed \\"personal growth\\" that our culture encourages, and still manage to carve a happy and fulfilling life for her/himself.  This book shows how this is possible.  To be a little clearer, the book answers the question \\"How can you be a very ordinary man and live a boring life in a boring town and have no education or ambition or much spiritual life to speak of---and yet participate to the max in all life and the universe has to offer?\\"<br />When I finished reading Renato's Luck, I felt uplifted and inspired about the little things in my own life, and the value of each life, no matter how mundane or ordinary it looks to the outsider.<br />The descriptions of Italian life are beautiful too;  they are not long windy descriptions though but more a \\"showing\\" than a \\"telling\\" which allowed you to absorb Tuscany culture feeling almost like you were there.<br />I rated it four stars instead of five because I think it is a very good book but not a great book (not one that I will read and reread over and over again, highlight and treasure forever).  That said, it's well worth the money.<br />****	2004-06-22

It is written by a formerly Baptist minister, now with Fuller Theological Seminary, so it is ideal reading for those Christians who come from a non-charismatic background who believe that Christians cannot be bothered by demons.  It is well-grounded in Scripture, and calmly written, making it markedly different than some sensationalistic books that hype up this area and focus on excessive emotionalism.<br />If you do not believe that demons can affect Christians, or if you suspect they can, but don't know how, this is the book for you.  It is meaty, and in-depth, repeating common themes so that they can be absorbed, not just read about.<br />If you are a Christian and have been bothered by recurring or troublesome problems in your life and/or those of believers around you, and can't figure out why, this book will have many answers for you.  I think it should be required reading for every committed believer, or every believer who wants to be an overcomer, truly free in every area of his/her life.<br />The main purpose of the book, aside from information and understanding about this area, is to motivate believers to have the courage to step out in ministry in this important area.  It establishes a Scriptural basis for this, and walks you through beginning in basic, everyday ministry.<br />I learned so much, because I knew little about demons, but was very afraid to find out.  This book allays your fears, and teaches you the truth from the Word of God so that you will not be afraid.  It gave me the courage to step out; in fact, today my husband and I prayed about some issues and it worked!  Of course, God always comes through, but it was exciting to have the encouragement and training so that I could have the confidence to take this important first step---trying for the first time.  If you are in any type of ministry, even &quot;just&quot; in your home to your family, and are afraid to begin or don't know where to start, this is the book for you.e in any type of ministry, even &quot;just&quot; in your home to your family, and are afraid to begin or don't know where to start, this is the book for you.	2004-03-21

It was exciting for me to read about someone in my party (I am a Democrat) with strong ethical values and opinions plus the courage to stand up for them and to speak out.  This takes hutzpa in our politically correct culture.  If you are a Democrat, but feel discouraged at the overrepresentation of the party by (as you see it) hate-filled liberals, this book will be encouraging to you.  Zell Miller is an honorable individual with both character and courage, and knowing that he remains a Democrat makes me proud of my party for a change.<br />The book is filled with specific things he did to improve the lives of the people of Georgia---ideas that worked!  He contemplates ways of improving our country now and laments many of the failures of others' past efforts to effect change.  Zell Miller discusses the importance of the arts (not a traditional conservative view).  He also discusses the controversy surrounding the current environmental policy of the Bush administration and presents a view that supports some of their decisions---all based on facts.  When he criticizes the Bush administration, he does so with respect, and not like a two-year old who badly needs a diaper change---so refreshing! This book makes you think.<br />Some of Zell Miller's idea are surprising, but all are provocative and ethical.  If only our current Democratic candidates could take a hint from Zell Miller and present concrete, do-able ideas that are value-based, I think that our country would have a viable challenge to Bush.  Unfortunately, this looks like it won't happen.<br />If you agree with my opinions, are turned off by Democratic demagogues, and wish there were more conservative Democrats, you'll like this book.  If you are liberal or progressive and tolerant, I think you'll enjoy it too.  If you are part of the so-called radical left you will probably find Zell Miller old-fashioned or unenlightened and be quite intolerant of him, his book, those who read his book, and those who think about reading his book.  Still, you might want to buy it anyway and have fellow rad-libs over for a book-burning party while chanting &quot;Anybody But Bush&quot;!of him, his book, those who read his book, and those who think about reading his book.

Some people know from an early age what they want to do with their lives, learn to do it, are happy doing it, and never think about changing; this book is for those of us who are NOT those people.<br />There are many career books written to help coach you with questionnaires, advice, and other direct methods.  This is not that type of book.  It is a series of interviews of various types of people from all socioeconomic groups and what the author Po Bronson learned from talking with them.  I found it helpful as I read along, because I would visualize myself talking to the interviewees and Po and think of how I might respond in the same situations.<br />Quite a view of the people interviewed were still confused about what they were doing, still didn't have the definitive answer they wanted.  This is realistic, too, in my opinion.  Some of them made false starts.  All of them learned a lot about themselves in the process of their search/journey, and this is the point of the book.<br />If you have already been through the &quot;What Color is Your Parachute?&quot;-type of books (excellent books, of course, but not like this one) and need a different, less structured way (sans &quot;exercises&quot;) of finding out the best work for this time in your life, I would recommend this book.	2004-01-31

There are, as of this writing, 288 reviews written already, many which describe the content of the book beautifully.  I wanted to add here some information about who might want to order it.<br />If you are a person that loves to be kept up late at night by a novel you just can't put down, you will enjoy this book.  It is long, as others have said, but it never is slow; in fact, I would love to read a sequel.<br />I devoured this book and could not wait to find out what happened next.  I was a little afraid that I would be offended by the explicit sexuality described by others, but I was not, as it was not gratuitous.  Sexuality was simply a part of life for the characters in the book, as it is for us today. The sexual themes were different, as the main character is a prostitute, but there is a great deal of her life that any woman could identify with, maybe even---that most women today could identify with.  I know I did.<br />I was not particularly interested in this time period historically, nor am I a fan of Dickens---you can still enjoy the book having these characteristics.  The time period, for me, was incidental, and reading about class and gender differences at that time in history caused me to think about class and gender differences in my own time and relationships between men and women now.<br />This is simply a great, beautifully written story.  It is entertaining, but not light in the sense that there are many layers of messages and meaning that are not superficial that one can think about as one reads.  For me it was a deep book.  I finished it a couple of weeks ago, and I am still thinking about it.<br />I would encourage you to read it if you want to get lost in a lovely story and think about your life and how you relate to the opposite sex.  About what immorality and morality truly is, even if you already think you know.  I hate romances, and it is definitely NOT a romance...it is more for someone who wonders about romance..and love...and marriage...and men and women...for someone who thinks different unspoken things and wonders if anyone else thinks the same way.  I know this sounds sort of mysterious, but that's how the book is too, and if it intrigues you, don't hesitate---get it and then enjoy!<br />******ance...it is more for someone who wonders about romance..and love...and marriage...and men and women...for someone who thinks different unspoken things and wonders if anyone else thinks the same way.

I have been confused recently by many of the popular diet books like Atkins, South Beach Diet, and No-Grain Diet, as they made sense to me yet when I tried to eat this way I felt horrible.  I had previously lost a great deal of weight eating raw food at a raw food retreat, but could not keep up this way of eating in the real world.  I really didn't know what to do, except to keep searching and trying new things.<br />Then, over the last three days, I read Eat to Live.  This book answered all of the questions I had about the popular diet programs.  It showed me a practical way that I could integrate my belief in and my success with raw foods into a healthy eating plan that I could follow for the rest of my life (although Eat to Live incorporates all types of healthy foods, not just raw foods).  It explained why so many studies on nutrition seemingly contradict one another.  Everything the author says is backed up with research from peer-reviewed journals.  It is the solution I have been waiting for, not just to my weight problem (I still have about 50 pounds to lose) but to my health problems, and for my lifestyle in general.<br />I hope to follow this way of eating for the rest of my life.  I am very excited because the author has extremely simple recipes (the book is mostly informative, though, not mostly recipes like some diet books).  He also explains how this can be followed with a harried and hectic lifestyle or while traveling.<br />The author promotes nothing that has not been studied extensively in the medical literature, making this book very appealing to physicians and others in the medical field.  It is technical, so it is good for people familiar with scientific study and medical terminology; however, someone wanting the basic message of the book can skip over these parts and figure out how to do the eating plan very easily.  I am just the type of person who wants to understand WHY everything is done and WHY I should modify parts of my diet, so for me this book was a breath of fresh air moving through my life, showing me what I needed to know and what I need to do.<br />For those who choose to follow the diet and want extensive support, the author provides this, too, via his website---from low-cost ways to more costly one-on-one support.  However, unlike many other diet books, the author does not set himself up as a diet guru, nor does he bad-mouth other diet book authors when he critiques their programs.  One gets the feeling that he wrote the book truly to help people improve their health.<br />This book was an answer to prayer for me, and I thank God that the author wrote it.g is done and WHY I should modify parts of my diet, so for me this book was a breath of fresh air moving through my life, showing me what I needed to know and what I need to do.<br />For those who choose to follow the diet and want extensive support, the author provides this, too, via his website---from low-cost ways to more costly one-on-one support.

It was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I would not call it an easy read, because it was some work to keep track of all of the different characters, but nevertheless, so very well worth it.  Despite the work, it was entertaining.  Like other reviewers, it kept me up at night, and kept me reading.<br />The book caused me to wonder how I would behave had I the same cultural background as the various characters in the book---the white slave owners, black slave owners, the black slaves.  I had always thought before that I &quot;of course&quot; would be against slavery, would fight for rights for all races, and absolutely never do anything so repulsive as to own slaves.  I wondered how anyone ever could!  The Known World opened my eyes to how this could happen, and how easily one of those slaveowners---black or white---could have been me.  Or how easily I could have been a slave.  It also provided insight into the psychological world of the slave.  All of this was done by showing, not telling, so the reading was more of a powerful emotional experience rather than an intellectual experience.<br />What made this so different for me is that I picked this book soley upon the Amazon reviews and rankings.  I had no inherent interest in American history or race relations or the Civil War era, but this book GOT me interested.  I think that the only person who would not enjoy this book would be the person who is not open or interested in challenging themselves, not interested in thinking, or afraid to find out about or explore the dark side of the human experience.<br />Because of the complexity of the book, as far as the feelings of the characters, the layers of meaning, and the strong impact, I know that I will read this book again and again, and am therefore glad that I spent the money to get it in hardback.  It is well worth the money, and is a beautiful &quot;rough cut&quot; book.  I have thought about its message again and again since reading it; I would call it haunting, thought-provoking, disturbing, and honest.ook.

This book is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of books!  If you are looking for one book to help you understand the Rosary better, then this is it.  It covers every aspect of the Rosary in depth, and adds  much detail, making it a treasure chest of knowledge about the Catholic  faith.  It is written in a compelling way, never dry;  and  although it is  an expensive book, it is worth every penny.  I know that I will reread it  over and over again;  in addition, I hope to teach a class at my church  this year on it.  I have several other books on the Rosary, but this is  worth all of them put together.	1999-01-18
