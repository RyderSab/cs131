In this case, however, the intricacies of genealogy weigh the story down at the expense of action and plot.  While the characterizations start out strong, they also fall victim to way too many characters and genealogy threads.      I read about two-thirds of this book in a day, then didn't pick it up again for weeks because it simply didn't hold my interest.  Having said that, if you are interested in genealogy, you will probably enjoy this book a good deal more than I did. But if you're looking for a good romance/suspense novel, you may well be disappointed.	2005-09-21
US	52317431	R2CHGQNLAPC9HE	031234032X	911452727	Love Creeps: A Novel	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Surreal Satire	I picked up this book, expecting a nice frothy romance, but got an insightful treatise on modern day love and dating among singles instead.  I wasn't at all disappointed.  The author has a real feel for much of the miscommunication and consequent ennui that affects certain segments of our society, and her absolutely deadpan style of presenting somewhat outrageous ideas is both amusing and thought-provoking at the same time.   <br /> <br />One theme runing through this book is that many people are attracted only to those they can't have, and when they occasionally succeed, then they no longer want the former object of their affections; perhaps it is only the chase that they love, and what first attracted, then repels.  Or perhaps they fall in love with what they would like the other person to be, not what he or she really is.  All of this is illustrated through a series of people stalking people, a homeless man (and former psychologist) watching the stalkers, and an assortment of friends, murderers, and other characters thrown in the mix.   <br /> <br />The author gives the reader an option of accepting a happily-ever-after ending, or a more cynical and realistic one in the denouement (which, of course, one must read).  <br /> <br />This is may not be a book for everyone, but if your approach to relationships is more sardonic than romantic, you will probably enjoy this novel.	2005-08-31

What I particularly liked was the fiesty, distrusting heroine who is finally won over by the decent hero; Lily and Alex start out disliking each other, and the tension between them fairly crackles.  Furthermore, Lily has a few flaws and has made a few mistakes, which makes her much more believable and human.  The fast-moving plot keeps the reader engaged, and the ending is very satisfying.  <br /> <br />Well done, and highly recommended.	2005-08-23

Bradly does a good job of having her characters skulk about to discover the traitor, and the tension between Rose and Collis is well done. <br /> <br />Romance, intrigue, adventure -- a nice way to spend the afternoon.	2005-08-23
US	52317431	R2EUTZZBFDDPJQ	0441012485	746649602	Od Magic	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Beguiling	I've never read any books by this author before (though I will certainly seek out her previous books), and I was very impressed with how beautifully she writes and creates her characters and the world of magic.  What was different from a lot of fantasy books that I've read is that there is no real evil villain in this book; just people, albeit somewhat strange ones, trying to do the best they can with their lots in life, whether they be royalty or a mere gardener.  I think it's much harder to plot a book when all of the characters are reasonably well-intentioned, even if some of them are misguided, because the layering of the character must be a lot more complex to keep the reader's interest.     The wizard school in Numis is a fascinating place indeed, and mystical and dreamy world that the author creates is inhabited by interesting folk and occurences.  There are several plot lines working in this novel, and the author manages to tie all of them up neatly at the end (which is something else I really appreciate).    Well done and highly recommended.	2005-08-23

It is not as good as the first two of her \\"Undead\\" series, but she still manages to create amusing characters, interesting situations, and fairly snappy dialog.   <br /> <br />Not her very best work, but certainly worth a read.	2005-08-23

Much of the first part of the book reads like a tragic romance novel, and the reader keeps hoping for a happy reconciliation for both of his parents and that the Wicked Stepmother will be foiled.  Alas, that doesn't happen, and as the book progresses from his family to the author's later struggles in life, it's fairly easy to lose interest.  His parents, and even his stepmother, are larger than life; the author is just another privileged but neglected kid who messed up and finally turned his life around.  Admirable, yes; fascinating, no.	2005-08-23
US	52317431	R2NSX3AV111M3Y	1416505458	319639744	Marriage Most Scandalous	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Unbelievable	This book starts out great:  we have the dangerous and mysterious hero, the plucky heroine, and slightly sinister circumstances.  Naturally, the two dislike each other from the start, even though they find each other physically attractive.  This part was well done and held much promise for a good read.  But the book begins to wobble when the concept of \\"divorce\\" is mentioned -- something that rarely existed in England at the time -- and it really falls apart during the last two chapters with an extraordinarily implausible ending.  A reader can suspend disbelief for only so long, and this rushed and highly unlikely scenario simply doesn't ring true.    That said, it's not a bad read, but those who are expecting Lindsey's best work are certain to be disappointed.	2005-08-22
US	52317431	ROWDYDENX8JNE	0765312409	959221788	Sofie Metropolis	Books	3	6	11	N	N	Needs More Work	This book is at its best when it is describing Sophie's family, both Greek and extended.  The authors have many of the Greek archetypes down pat (and growing up with a Greek grandfather, I know wherein they speak).  Sophie herself is an interesting character, and many of her asides are quite amusing. <br /> <br />What I didn't like about this book, however, is that the plot is very disjointed.  The mystery aspect is pretty transparent, and being muddled does NOT equate with suspense.  What's even more annoying is that the book seems more like an installment in a serial than a novel.  Far too many plot lines are left unresolved (What happened to the grandfather's medal?  Where's the diamond?  Who really is Jake?), so the book feels very incomplete. <br /> <br />Conclusion:  Not a bad read, but it could have been much, much better.	2005-08-21

It is a romance, a mystery, a wonderfully atmospheric period piece, and a character study.  The author has a theme which she carries through to the end with a twist (and you probably won't see it coming).   <br /> <br />I also enjoyed that she went down several layers of English society for her Victorian protagonists, giving her a great deal more flexibility with plot.  Concordia and Ambrose are no hothouse plants, nutured in the English aristocracy and hidebound by tradition, but orphans who have learned how to survive by their wits.  Yet they each have a core of goodness and decency, and the real question is whether they can overcome their sad childhoods and embrace the feelings they develop for each other.  <br /> <br />Well done and highly recommended.	2005-08-15

Unfortunately, the author seems to be on automatic pilot through the first three-quarters of this novel, when the reader is subjected to unfunny and tedious whining from Betsy, Queen of the Vampires, and very little in the way of wit, action, and plot.  Only toward the end does the reader find some of the snappy dialog and amusing characters that we have come to expect from MJD. <br /> <br />Hopefully, the author will spend more time on the next installment of Betsy's adventures -- the addition of her half-sister, spawn of the devil, should prove most interesting.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-03

Some (but not enough) of her trademark humor is present, and the mystery is nicely done.  But I very much miss her wit and brilliant, outrageous characterizations and hope she will ditch this field of inquiry (the Edwardian Age) and return to Regencies post haste.	2005-06-18

People are not always what they seem, and Delinsky does a very good job interweaving the tales of the various characters with the plot twists to a satisfying (if vaguely improbable) ending.	2005-06-18

The mystery, characterizations, and humour aspects which her readers have grown to love are present in full force.  The archeological background is particularly tantalizing, with the mention of the real-life Carter, and I can't wait to see in future installments if perhaps it was really Emerson who discovered the location of tomb of King Tut.  (I wouldn't be at all surprised, because Emerson, as the faithful know, is the greatest archeologist of his or any age.) <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2005-06-18
US	52317431	R303EPI4X7WL12	0758204418	616615582	Lone Calder Star	Books	3	7	9	N	N	Good read	Having exhausted Montana for the moment, the Calder saga has moved to Texas with the next generation.  While I think Dailey's last book (Calder Promise) was better, she nevertheless does a pretty good job with the latest installment.  The interesting characterizations are there (I think the Dallas could have been a little better, but Easy was great), and while the plot may be a little thin in places, it still works for the most part -- though it didn't seem plausible to me that Quint wouldn't call in the reserves when he started having problems. <br /> <br />All in all, a decent read.	2005-06-18
US	52317431	RJWZ24E2GAVL6	0345476891	761960837	Stolen Magic	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Truly Magical!	This is a wonderfully and imaginatively written novel.  Putney does not disappoint in her sequel to A Kiss of Fate (also highly recommended).  In this book, we have Guardians of magic, and we have Simon, enforcer of the Guardian Council, who becomes snared in a net of black magic which transforms him into a unicorn. And thus the tale begins.  Simon's struggles to regain and maintain his human form, save the innocent, and defeat evil are aided by Meg, a magical woman who has been hidden in plain sight.  They also manage to make England safe for the industrial revolution.  Trust me:  All of this weaves together wonderfully for a most satisfying read, with strong characterizations and plot.    Those who are looking for more a plain vanilla romantic tale may not enjoy Putney's foray into the realm of fantasy and magic; personally, I can't wait for the next installment.	2005-06-18

However, it is very entertaining, well written, well plotted, and has interesting characters.  Some people expecting a straight hetero romance/suspense tale might be a bit put off by the gay relationships in the book; personally, I think they added depth and breadth to the novel.  There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader engaged until the end, so this novel is definitely recommended.	2005-06-18

Personally, if I'm going to spend a few hours reading a book, I'd like some real interaction between the characters, not just postmortem descriptions of what happened.    That aside, the characters and their tales are rather interesting, and the author is skilled, and one can only hope that her next novel will take a different tack.	2005-04-08

The characters were interesting, the plot well developed, and there's a nice unexpected twist at the end (though most people could probably figure it out if they were really paying attention).

I haven't read this author before, and it was such a nice experience to read a book that was more about ordinary people, trying to live their lives as best they could, than about plot machinations and torrid sex scenes every other page (not that there's anything wrong with that).  One comes to care about these characters and sympathize with their struggles of having to compromise about a real estate development, acknowledging that the children are really growing up and parents are really growing old. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for a well written book with strong character development, this book's the ticket.

Many contemporary Regency writers do not have this ability, and I am sad to say, this book is no exception to that. <br /> <br />Not very much happens in this book.  The heroine is more idiot than madcap, and the situations into which she throws herself are ludicrous.   <br /> <br />In short, this book is boring and tedious, and the reader will find herself yawning in no time at all. <br /> <br />	2004-11-25

The descriptions of Alaska, the characterizations, and the mystery are quite good, though all of these are really at the expense of the romance aspect of the novel, which wasn't particularly appealing and lacked dramatic tension.  However, my major complaint is it takes forever for anything to happen, and there are a lot of unnecessary parts that could have easily been omitted.  This book meanders rather than flows. <br /> <br />That said, I still mostly enjoyed it, and the novel will likely serve as a travelogue to inspire readers to head north to see the northern lights and other natural beauty of Alaska.	2004-11-20

Though I have dozens of other tarot decks, many of them beautiful and fascinating, I always return to this one. <br /> <br />This is a masterful book that examines each card in great detail, and it includes numerology and astrology as well.  Arrien's approach is excellent, and while some of the ideas may take a little more work for the novice, I always believe in starting with the best despite one's level of sophistication and experience in a subject. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2004-11-11

This book starts out interestingly enough, but it soon grows tedious due to the highly unbelievable actions and motiviations of its characters.  The six protagonists act more like grade school children than adults, and they become fatiguing very quickly.  The book is full of cliched platitudes about life, and the use of physical violence on the part of the women strikes another sour note.  Was this supposed to be funny?  The only positive thing I have to say about this book is that it's short, so the reader is soon put out of her/his misery in watching the unentertaining antics of people who need to grow up.  <br />  <br />This one isn't even worth borrowing from the library.	2004-11-08

I think this book is as good as Mercy, one of her newer romantic suspense ventures, and I thoroughly enjoyed her excellent characterizations and plot line.  This is an interesting and skillfully told story, with an intriguing premise.   <br /> <br />Personally, I found the book to be very satisfying.  Be forewarned, though, that the mystery/suspense angle of the story is stronger than the romantic part, and that may disappoint some readers. <br /> <br />	2004-11-07

The characters just aren't very appealing, and their motivation is very thin.   <br /> <br />One of the hallmarks of a Regency novel (ala the modern mistress of the genre, Georgette Heyer, and her predecessor, Jane Austen) is that it be a comedy of manners; if one must give someone a set down, it is done in the most deliciously polite way.  I found the behavior of both protagonists, especially the heroine, to be extraordinarily boorish.  Worse, there is no basis for their attraction to each other, and everything that proceeds from there simply doesn't track. <br /> <br />In short, save your time and money on this one.	2004-10-31

The characters are likeable and believable, and the story proceeds at a very rapid pace.  The author injects humor and danger in equal parts, and her use of music is woven wonderfully into the book. <br /> <br />This author is able to do in a relatively short novel what many authors cannot in ones twice as long, i.e., engage the reader in a satisfying read from start to finish.	2004-10-30

My main complaint is that the plot, such as it is, really loses steam about three-fourths of the way through, so finishing this book is a bit tedious.  <br /> <br />Sharper editing and closer attention to historical detail would have made this a much better book.

The characterizations were wonderful, and while some people may object to the disinterest in the beginning of the father toward his young children, that is something that was not uncommon in the real Regency England.  What makes the characters interesting is how they grow and evolve and realize mistakes they have made in the past.  The secondary characters were even more fun than the primary ones; I especially liked the relationship between Eleanor and the duke.    The ending is very satisfying, with all the characters assembled train wreck style for the dramatic conclusion.  Above all, this book has wit and style, and I for one thoroughly enjoyed it.	2004-10-25

The heroine and most of the other characters are likewise interesting, and I also enjoyed all of the circus and horse descriptions.   <br /> <br />But the hero is dull, dull, dull; this is an earl and an officer in Wellington's army, and he's completely passive?  His character simply doesn't ring true.   <br /> <br />Moreover, the novel just drags on and on, slowly meandering to its foregone conclusion. The story would have been better served if the main characters had been more involved in the disposition of the gold; give us a little danger and excitement and really put the characters at risk. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  It's an okay read, but nothing to get excited about, and nowhere near Wolf's best work. <br />	2004-10-10

I think it is a legitimate endeavor to see what a Calder heir is like when she has been raised with wealth and privilege and is able to take success for granted, not struggle to achieve it.   <br /> <br />There are frequently members of any family who, for one reason or another, don't quite fit in with the rest.  So we have Laura, who is more than a little spoiled and who values the culture and sophistication in a world larger than the Triple C ranch.  She's young, she's beautiful, she's rich; she's also a little wild and unconventional.  She's used to having men pursue her, and she enjoys manipulating them to get what she wants. <br /> <br />In many ways, this is a coming of age novel, in which the heroine has to decide who she is and what her values are.  Will she embrace her Calder legacy, or will she go her own way?  Will she get involved in life, or will she merely be a spectator, using her wealth as a buffer?  Will she marry the man she has fallen in love with, or will she marry the wealthy man who will provide her with an opulent but probably shallow lifestyle? <br /> <br />If you are a longtime Dailey fan, as I am, you already know the answers to these questions.  One of Dailey's strengths as a writer is to take imperfect people, present them with problems, and give them the opportunity to grow while they overcome them.  She does this very well in this novel, as well as providing strong new characterizations, snappy dialog, and steamy romance. <br /> <br />There's more to be seen with the nextgeneration of Calders, and I for one am looking forward to it.	2004-10-03

While they may be interesting, they simply weren't nuanced enough for the reader to care much what happens to them.  The more villainous of the lot were too dark a shade of black with no intriguing grey side to them or even mildly redeeming qualities to keep you guessing about what they would do next.  The so-called hero and heroine were basically boring, and there just didn't seem to be much emotional chemistry between them.  And you can see the ending coming a mile away.    That said, it's not a bad afternoon diversion, but if you are expecting SB at her stellar best, you may be disappointed.	2004-09-21

The crazy family part of the book was mildly interesting, but the main characters are simply too nice to be believable.  There's not a fault in any of them -- other than a little emotional backwardness -- so there's really no dramatic tension at all, although there's plenty of sophomoric psychology 101, which was way, way overdone.  Personally, I like characters with a little bit of an edge to their personalities to keep a book interesting.  When you couple unintriguing characters with a very thin plot, you have a deadly dull read.	2004-09-12

Personally, I liked this book a lot; it was very suspenseful and meticulously plotted.  The characters are well drawn, the book moves along nicely, and there are some nice unexpected twists at the end.  The heroine -- a contract CIA assassin -- is not particularly sympathetic, but she is quite interesting, as are the hero and secondary characters.  If the reader approaches this book as a thriller rather than a romance, then it is very satisfying.

However, considering its much shorter length -- a little over 300 pages, compared to nearly twice that size for Requiem for the Sun, the first installment of this trilogy, and nowhere near the 850+ pages for Destiny, the last installment of the first trilogy -- you still get a lot of bang for the buck.    It is hard to top the cunning menace of the F'dor, yet Haydon still manages breathtaking suspense and action with the awakened Anwyn and the transformed Faron.  I was delighted to see the emphasis on dragons in this book, and those who are fond of Haydon's beasts will be very satisfied.  I would have liked to have seen more of Grunthor (my very favorite character, with Achmed a close second).  And we at last have the birth of Meridion, the time manipulator; I'm hoping at some point in this series we get to see the time line that Meridion changed, which Haydon has tantalizingly hinted at on a few occasions.    If you are as entranced with these characters and Haydon's writing as I am, you will enjoy this book.  If you are expecting another long, complex novel like the previous ones, you may be slightly disappointed and simply have to wait for the next installment, which Elegy has set up beautifully.	2004-08-22

The plot premise is interesting enough, but the characters are appalling.  First, we have the dimwitted heroine who, though she is supposed to be a smart, crackerjack Assistant D.A., alerts the men she considers suspects in her mother's 25-year-old murder (as if putting murder suspects on their guard is the most effective way of getting information from them).  Then she socializes and/or sleeps with the suspects (gee, one of these guys is a murderer, so it must be safe).  Most of the time, she wanders around town, accomplishing nothing, until the last few pages of the book, when the murder mystery finally kicks in, and you remember why you believe Sandra Brown is a fine writer.    But the most disgusting thing about this book is the incessant vulgarity and crudeness of all of the male (and some of the female) characters, especially Reede, the \\"hero.\\"  There is nothing appealing about this man; in fact, there's nothing appealing about any of the male characters.    Don't waste your time with this one.	2004-08-21

The premises of both of the plots, one involving a ghost and another involving the murder of a Supreme Court justice, were quite intriguing.  Unfortunately, Coulter resolves both plots with deus ex machina type villains that simply don't ring true.  Thrillers are so much more interesting when the villain is right under the reader's nose, instead of thrown in at the end as a hackneyed plot contrivance.  Yes, it would have taken a lot more work to make the killer someone that all the characters knew, but that would have made the book excellent, instead of merely passable. <br /> <br />That said, this book is an improvement over \\"Blind Side,\\" the last Coulter book I read.  But I think that the real problem is that the author needs to find entirely new protagonists, because she's milked Savich and Sherlock for as much as she can get out of them, and while the earlier books in this series were stellar, the concept has simply run out of steam.	2004-08-09

I found the plot contrivances a little far fetched -- especially the \\"dress the maid up as a debutante\\" one, and the interplay between the classes simply didn't ring very true for me.

It seems with her last few books that she wants to become more of a mainstream writer and escape the romance writer label, and to that end, I think she's doing a good job with the mystery/suspense elements.  She really keeps the reader guessing and the story moving along. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for straight romance, you may be disappointed with this book.  But if you like a lot of jewelry information and suspense thrown in with a little romance, then this is an enjoyable read.	2004-08-08

The information is invaluable, especially the section on how to find a sound realtor (I did, and she was able to negotiate a good price for me) and how not to buy more house than you should.  The author also tells you what to look for in a house and alerts you to pitfalls that the first-time home buyer might be completely unaware of, and walks you through how to obtain a mortgage and the various steps involved in bidding on a house and closing the deal. <br /> <br />This is a must-read for someone who has never bought a home (be it a house or a condo) before and is immensely educational and helpful. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!	2004-08-01

The book appears to be well researched and documented and gives the reader a real feel for what the Kennedy White House must have been like, warts and all.  I found the view to be balanced, presenting both the strengths and the personal foibles of the people involved.<br />The book is full of fascinating historical dichotomies; for example, it shows how the administration would deal with war with Russia over Cuba during the day, and then party at night.  (One must maintain one's standards, even in the face of nuclear annihilation.)  The reader also gets a real sense of tremendous responsibilities and burdens that go with living in the White House. <br />To digress a bit, what I really got from this book was a reminder of what politics in the USA used to be like, when politicians were more interested in doing what was best for the country, before the citizens of all political persuasions allowed it to become so bitterly and unproductively polarized.  There used to be dialog between the political parties instead of ranting; there used to be pragmatic compromises and solutions instead of unyielding positions; and there used to be respect for the concept that reasonable minds can differ.  Camelot, indeed.<br />That reminder alone makes this a worthwhile read.	2004-07-15

I, along with many other readers, have been waiting eagerly to see Wulfric meet his match, forget about duty for a while, and fall madly in love.<br />I think the main problem in this book is that Wulfric is not first introduced to the reader in his normal milieu, i.e., as the cold, forbidding duke intimidating his siblings and anyone else who gets in his way.  The author presupposes that all readers will automatically remember previous books, and instead of showing us what Wulfric is like and how he interacts with others, she simply tells us.  This has the unforunate consequence of minimizing the dramatic tension and making the book less interesting than it should have been.  And I would have expected his character, especially considering his age, to have had a little more experience with women.<br />While this book isn't as good as previous ones in the the series, it is still a very good read, marked by Balogh's trademark wit and excellent writing.<br />In short, not what I'd hoped for, but still mostly satisfying.	2004-07-13

While I can understand the necessity of aging the characters in such a long series, I personally am not ready to see Amelia and Emerson consigned to the old archeologists' home, where they are merely subsidiary foils for the rest of the cast.<br />This is a much better book than her previous one, wherein the plot was lost in a maze of uninteresting characters.  Thanks to the device of finding lost papers of the &quot;missing years,&quot; Amelia and Emerson go back in time to return to the Lost Oasis, one of the most intriguing and satisfying adventures of the series.<br />In short, Amelia is back in full force.

I really didn't like the hero that much, nor did I find all of his psychological problems particularly interesting.  I find it implausible when 18th century characters spout 20th century college psychology.

US	52317431	R3CNLW4YI04AWB	0399150560	200095985	Blindside (FBI Thriller)	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Tired	Much as I have liked and recommended Coulter's previous books, I find that this one just doesn't measure up.  The plot is thin and weak, and what's worse, she uses the same implausible gimmicks more than once, further insulting the reader's intelligence.  **SPOILERS AHEAD**  If one kid jumping out a window to escape the bad guys is good, let's do it again with two kids!  If one villain purportedly dead escapes a fire, let's resurrect another one with another fire!  Couldn't we at least have had a flood for variety?    The main characters, all experienced law enforcement officers, repeatedly make mistakes that even a rookie cop on the beat wouldn't.  It's very difficult to find stupidity engaging, much less an interesting plot twist.    The characters didn't have much chemistry with each other, and the relationship resolutions were simply too big a stretch given what has gone before.  These are supposed to be smart people, and smart people would exercise much better judgment than the lead characters did.    Not even Sherlock and Savich, two captivating characters from previous books, add enough to make this a worthwhile read.    Coulter is normally a very good writer, so let's hope that she gets back on track with her next novel.	2004-02-15

For those whose day was cheered simply by seeing what dark, irreverent, or otherwise totally off the wall idea he had created, the lack of Larson on a daily basis has left a huge hole that no one following him has been able to fill.<br />Far Side addicts, rejoice!  This is a complete compliation of many old friends and a some not previously published ones, and if one reads these tomes slowly, it's almost like having a daily Far Side fix again.  The books are of wonderful quality and the drawings are beautifully reproduced, well worth every penny!  Plus there are fascinating essays by Larson that aren't available in any of the other compilations of The Far Side.<br />My only complaint is that the books are very large, heavy (each one weighs about 10 pounds -- I weighed them on my scale; in fact, there was a warning from Amazon about the weight on the package containing them) and a bit cumbersome to manage.  Three or four volumes would have been better.  But this is not an impediment to purchasing these books, because the content and the quality overcome this slight deficiency.<br />Enjoy!	2004-01-23

The plot was interesting enough, but there simply isn't any chemistry between the main characters; in fact, the villains of the piece are far more intriguing and better drawn.  I found myself nodding off after the first two chapters due to lack of interest.  If you are a Layton fan, save your money on this one, and reread one of her earlier books.	2003-11-22
US	52317431	R2ASUSMHQ9WEU7	0066214769	637368678	Children of the Storm	Books	3	8	11	N	N	A Little Boring	I have been a fan of Elizabeth Peters since before she started the Amelia Peabody series; she is one of my favorite writers.<br />So I was dismayed to find that the latest sequel in this series falls a little flat, because I have grown so fond of these characters and look foward with keen anticipation to their next adventure.<br />The first part of the book is filled not with action and mystery, but with tedious domestic details.  And there are so many members of the three-generation family and extended family that it is difficult to keep them straight, and many of them add nothing to the book at all.  The usually razor sharp wit of the characters seemed dulled to me; they just didn't seem to be having much fun (nor was I, for that matter).  And the spine-tingling adventure that normally keeps the reader on the edge of his/her seat was sadly missing.  The characters never seemed to be in any serious jeopardy, unlike past novels in this series.<br />The plot was pretty transparent as well, and I was disappointed that there weren't the usual red herrings cast about to keep the reader guessing.  Fortunately, the book does pick up steam toward the end.  However, if you haven't followed the series from the beginning, you may well be lost in the overpopulated maze of too many characters and references to previous books.<br />To be completely fair, the book is reasonably good; it is only in comparison to earlier and far better novels by Peters that it falls short.  There is still enough good writing in this to make it a worthwhile read -- Peters is the author, after all, and few write as well as she does, even when she's not at her absolute best.	2003-07-01

Even the as-usual marvelous cover art shows a maturing Harry, and in this fifth installment of Rowling's splendid series, Harry loses his innocence in more than one respect.<br />School becomes not his refuge from the Dursleys, but a gauntlet, run by a malicious High Inquisitor, who threatens not only Harry, but Dumbledore and all of Hogwarts as well.<br />Disillusionment sets in, as Harry realizes that even the best people have flaws.  Former friends desert Harry.  Adults he has depended upon are no longer available to him.<br />And while the usual menace from Voldemort is still wreaking havoc in Harry's life, this threat is muted.  Harry's real struggles are internal and with the world of adults in conflict with each other.  This Harry is an angry Harry, even petulant at times, a confused Harry, and a distrusting Harry.  In short, Harry is your typical 15-year old, trying to make sense of a challenging world and changing relationships.  How does Harry feel when his friends start to outshine him?  How does Harry handle authority from adult wizards he does not respect?  Will Harry learn how to master his rebellious temper, which repeatedly gets him into more than a little trouble?  How does Harry deal with loss:  of popularity, of his faith in certain adult wizards, and of someone very close to him?<br />Rowling brilliantly interweaves themes, emotions, and actions, and there are sufficient clues early on to tell the careful reader which one of the characters will not survive.<br />My only caution about this book is that it may be a little too dark for the youngest readers.  While there was humor in this book, as there was in all the others, the conclusion and overall tone is somewhat sorrowful, because Harry has once again lost someone he loves, and he has learned that all people -- including himself -- are fallible.  The Harry we see at the end of the book is quite a bit different from the Harry at the beginning -- older, wiser, and sadder.<br />But he is stil Harry, and with the help of his friends, old and new, he will be up to the mortal challenges that await him.sadder.<br />But he is stil Harry, and with the help of his friends, old and new, he will be up to the mortal challenges that await him.	2003-06-22

If one is going to write a period piece, then I think that the motivations of the characters should be consistent with the times and not have a modern-day feminist bent.  For example, I found it quite a stretch that the hero, not knowing whether or not the heroine could swim, would just wait to find out if she's drowning because he didn't want to impinge upon her independence.  Worse yet was the implication that the heroine would applaud his inaction as a tribute to her ability to take care of herself.  And if he were wrong, and she drowned because her clothes got snagged on a tree, oh, well, ooops!<br />I also found the almost every-other-page sex scenes a little excessive.  More dialogue and a stronger development of the secondary characters would have made for a much better novel.  We barely get to know the ultimate murderer because we are too busy peeping in the bedroom.<br />These complaints aside, this is still a worthwhile novel, and a decent conclusion to the excellent Cynster series.  Personally, I can't wait for her next series to begin, because she is a good writer.	2003-04-14

Her plot is nicely woven as well, which makes for an eminently satisfying read.<br />I especially appreciated how she ended the book, not resorting to any cheap tricks as a lesser writer might have done.

I personally enjoyed all the details about spelunking; one of Lowell's great strengths is the amount of research she draws on for her novels.  But if you aren't interested in the subject, you will be bored by this book, because there is a huge amount of detail about it, to the point that all the caving descriptions are at the expense of plot and character development.  <br />The hero didn't appeal to me; it's difficult to like, much less respect, a man who seduces a young woman and then disappears without ever following up with her personally to see if there were any consequences from their affair, and THEN has the nerve to be outraged when he thinks she had an abortion after he abandoned her.  Immaturity and irresponsibility are just not characteristics I find attractive in a man.  My sole response to the hero was that he needed grow up and get over himself.  As for the heroine, she was just a little too much of a stoic victim to suit my tastes.<br />I wish Lowell had left this book in the past, where it belonged, and spent her time writing a good novel instead of rehashing one that was mediocre at best to begin with, and certainly NOT worth a hardcover edition.	2003-04-09

I've been a big fan of Judith McNaught since her first book, Whitney, My Love, and impatiently look forward to reading anything she writes.  This book was worth the wait.  While there may be a few minor stretches when it comes to the plot, this is a very well-written and suspenseful book.  <br />**WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD**  <BR>Personally, I don't find it that extraordinary, as some reviewers do, that a widow who had incontrovertible proof that her deceased husband was a louse would immediately fall for someone who had adored her for years and was everything she thought the louse was but wasn't.  However much Leigh may have loved Logan, she knew he had betrayed her in the past, and while she may have chosen to stay with him, relationships are never quite the same after a partner strays.  And the reader was given further clues about their lack of intimacy and how Leigh was the person doing all of the maintenance in the relationship.  So all of the sudden, Leigh realizes that the person she was in love with didn't exist, and while she may grieve for her lost ideal, it wasn't real.  Faced with that realization, love can vanish in an instant.<br />So enter Michael Valente, one of McNaught's best heroes to date.  In fact, while there are a great many things to like about McNaught's writing, I find her compelling male characters to be her best strength.  She has the ability to capture what most women want in a man -- strong without being a bully, tender without being a wimp, and reliable without being a bore.  In short, a real, fascinating man who is capable of completely loving and appreciating a strong, successful woman without trying to control her.  Sigh.<br />Add to this the excellent, vibrant, and well-developed secondary characters (the romance between the detectives was also quite good, and even the least-mentioned characters come alive) and the frequently humorous interplay between them, and you have a fine book.  Yes, it takes a while to develop, and you don'tknow exactly where it's going in the beginning, but that's part of the enjoyment. <br />In short, great read, and highly recommended!	2003-04-06

She is very accomplished; reading anything she writes is always a pleasure, and this book is no exception.  <br />However, I do have a few quibbles with this book.  Even though I've read the predecessor books in this series, it would have been more effective if she had shown Annabelle in all her glory and up to her devious tricks, instead of just telling the reader about them.  Yes, this was very effectively done in the previous novels, but I believe each book needs to stand on its own and not assume the reader is familiar with prior work.<br />Also, while I thought that the psychological and relationship development of the protagonists was excellent, I would still have preferred to see a little more of the plot and action at which Layton excels.<br />These are minor complaints; this book is still well worth your time and money.	2003-03-20

The author writes brilliant and witty dialogue, the characters are highly amusing, and the plot is mildly intriguing.  <br />Admittedly, sometimes the plot and the motivations are a little thin, but the interaction between the characters (and what interesting characters they are!) more than makes up for this.<br />I like very much that these people are different; having known quite a few artists in my life, I find the quirkiness of the characters to be very true to life.  These people are not plain vanilla, and that's what makes them so much fun.<br />The absolute best thing about this book is the witty repartee.  Crusie really knows how to write humor, and in more than a few places, I laughed out loud.  I especially liked her take on how to con people in five easy steps, but that is just one of many hilarious passages.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-11-27

Most of the information, however, is new only to opera novices, not to those who have closely followed the opera scene for years.  <br />While the stated purpose of the book is to give the reader a behind-the-scenes look at the administration of the Met, there are simply too many omissions of important performers and their contributions to make this a truly satisfying read.  In short, this book could have been greatly enriched with more anecdotes about the performers who make the opera what it is.  This is not to slight the administrators, many of whom did amazing work in building the Met.  But a more complete picture would have been far more interesting, and for this reason, I was disappointed in this book.	2002-11-14

This is an absolutely fascinating tale of Guinevere, brilliantly written and told from the perspective that she was not just another pretty face, but a force to be reckoned with in her own right.  Those who do not like tales of powerful women or the rewriting of a beloved legend may not like this book; however, Arthur is not slighted in this novel at all and proves himself to be a worthy consort, surviving trials of his own.  The secondary characters, be they shape-shifting wolves, dragons, or Druids, are fabulous and extremely well-developed.  A caution:  It may be a bit unsettling to see Merlin as a villian, especially if you have read Mary Stewart's wonderful &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; and its sequels.<br />Borchardt is an amazing story teller, and this book will leave you breathlessly awaiting the two sequels in the trilogy.

The Earl of Drummond, heir to a Dukedom, meets Alexandria, a foundling of unknown origin, under less than auspicious circumstances.  They strongly resist their attraction to each other:  Drum, because his obligation to his family name has been ingrained in him since birth, and hence he must marry someone suitable of noble rank; Ally, because she knows that she could never be considered an socially-acceptable wife under strict class barriers that exist in Regency England.  Along the way to the resolution of this and a few other problems, we get to revisit colorful characters from Layton's previous &quot;C&quot; novels, and there is the occasional villain thrown in for good measure.  What makes Layton's books enjoyable is her skill in developing the characters slowly and her meticulous attention to detail in place and plot.  I would highly recommend any of her books, and if you are a long-time Layton fan, as I am, you will be very satisfied with this book.	2001-10-25

First, there is no way that the son of a duke would compromise a presumably gently-born woman (and thus force himself into matrimony) by moving into her house, nor would said woman allow it without an appropriate chaperone, if at all. And if Ferdinand is supposed to be such an honorable gentleman, he would not have done this, so it's very easy to start out disliking him, as well as completely losing respect for Viola, who has spent two years building her respectable reputation in the country after years of being an infamous prostitute in London and allows this to happen without a protest. The reader's credulity is further stretched by Ferdinand's being a 27 year old virgin.<br />These are not particularly appealing nor plausible characters, and the plot is for the most part very thin. Things pick up a bit when the protaganists finally get to London, and then you can see why Mary Balogh is generally a highly dependable and talented writer, because the last part of the book is much better than the first, if you can suspend disbelief that long. It's nice to see the characters from More than a Mistress, Balogh's previous book (which is an excellent read).<br />In short, save your money on this one and borrow it from the library if there is nothing better around.	2001-09-25

The characters are stereotypical, the dialogue tedious, and the plot leaden.  I could barely finish reading it.<br />In the author's favor, she does write good descriptive prose and is knowledgeable about Native American history and culture.  If there had been an interesting story and characters to accompany these positive attributes, then this would have been a good read.	2001-09-23

This is a fascinating read. She creates an intriguing world of role reversal and futuristic mysticism, replete with curious creatures and alien landscapes. Regardless of whether or not one likes the characters or the romance between them, this book is worth reading to see this strange and beguiling land.<br />As for the characters and the plot, I personally enjoyed both, and this author writes really steamy love scenes.  However, the novelty of the world she created is what really kept me turning the pages.	2001-09-23

She creates a fascinating world with compelling characters, magic, puzzles, plot twists, humor, and marvelous writing. If Rhapsody in places was a trifle slow, then Destiny more than makes up for it with almost non-stop action. The ending is immensely satisfying: All loose ends are tied up, all prophecies explained, and yet there is the veriest hint of what future books could contain, which in no way detracts from the conclusion. <br />A suggestion: Reread (or read) the first two installments before you read the third. Immersing oneself completely in this world for a few days adds immeasureably to the pleasure Destiny provides.<br />Bravo, Elizabeth! Give us more!	2001-09-16

This retelling of the Cinderella story, replete with wicked step-mother, two step sisters, and Prince Charming, is a well-written treat to read, and has some excellent plot twists from the original fairy tale. Julia Quinn continues her engaging tales of the Bridgerton family with her trademark style, wit, and ability to to weave a lively and enchanting story.

She has the ability to make a specific area of interest come alive, whether it's precious gems, or in this case, illuminated manuscripts. While I agree with some of the other reviewers that the tension between the hero and heroine could have been stronger, and I wish that some of the secondary characters had been given more play, this book was very engaging, especially with its flashbacks to previous lives. The ending wasn't a big surprise, since the mystery part of the novel could have used a red herring or two, but all in all, this is a good read.	2001-08-26

She is a master at plots and characterizations, and her latest effort is up to her usual excellent standards. She is adept at keeping the reader guessing about the villain until the last page, and in the meantime, she creates people that the reader cares about, all the while infusing her novels with a wry humor that makes them a joy to read.

I think the development of the relationship between the protagonists was better, and Howard has a lot of wicked fun with her characters. Her sly wit is a delight to read and she throws in enough mystery and suspense to keep it interesting. She does an excellent job with the secondary characters as well, and I liked that she tied up a few story lines at the end. All in all, certainly worth the time to read it.	2001-08-26
US	52317431	RXRTXB8I7E9TP	1575666731	667791678	Plain Jane	Books	4	4	5	N	N	Very Good - But Not Great	This book is 90% of the way to being excellent; as others have described, it has great characterizations and a good plot.  I especially like how well-developed the secondary characters are -- the mystery writers, the ghosts, and the dogs are worth reading about all by themselves, which is not to slight the ugly-duckling-turned swan heroine and her supportive beau.  <br />However, I have a few quibbles (and these are minor compared to the author's aformentioned accomplishments). The first is that there seemed to me to be a little too much &quot;tough love&quot; from some of the characters and not quite as much compassion as I would have expected from them.  The second is that the conclusion falls short -- it simply isn't dramatic enough, given the circumstances.  I did not expect the rapists to submit meekly as they did; it seemed totally out of character for them to do so, and the confrontation, while clever, lacked dramatic impact.<br />These are minor objections.  This is a very good book and well worth the time to read.	2001-05-27

To those who didn't appreciate the humor, I would remind them that this book is a farce, and while I agree that no one would really expect (or, indeed, want) a man, especially in a professional situation, to talk about how dessert goes straight to his thighs, that's the whole point!  Heller has a great time poking fun at both genders, and does it in such a witty, sly way that the reader laughs from cover to cover.  Her characterizations are dead on, and the plot is very well executed.  My only complaint is that I would have been more satisfied if some of the not-so-nice characters in the book really got their comeuppance, but then again, living well is the best revenge.  <br />In short, highly recommended!	2001-05-27

As an introduction to opera, Goulding's book is better written and more objective; however, &quot;Rough Guide&quot; includes information on more operas and what's available on CD.  This is a very useful source of information, but as other reviewers have suggested, investigate other sources before buying anything.  Personally, I like to have more than one reference of this sort available, because like all art, evaluating opera is a matter of opinion; guidelines are helpful, but the individual listener or viewer is the ultimate arbiter on what he or she appreciates most.	2001-03-25

This book is a fabulous introduction to opera, and I'd be willing to bet that even those very knowledgeable about opera could learn something new.  Goulding gives the reader a succinct history of the opera and the different styles of opera, he provides history, plot, and anecdotes about each of the top 85 operas and their composers, and explains the different types of opera voices and the roles to which they are suited.  If that's not enough information for you, he lists the most famous opera singers of the 20th century, including a fair evaluation of the best of the best.  He makes recommendations for recordings of each opera, though I find &quot;The Rough Guide&quot; to be more complete in this area.<br />What's really great about this book is that Goulding is not a professional musician, so the book is written from a layman's (or &quot;unwashed&quot;) point of view -- easy to understand -- but with comprehensive research that gives weight to his opinions.  His writing style is excellent, and he injects good-natured humor with a skill that lesser writers of similar books can only dream of achieving.<br />The book is well-organized and very readable -- a must have for anyone wanting to learn and appreciate this ultimate art form.	2001-03-22

I had missed the intro to the work and couldn't figure out to whom this incredible and unique voice belonged; I  knew I'd never heard anything remotely like it.  You have to hear Jussi only once to want to listen endlessly to his voice.  (Needless to say, my opera CD collection is expanding  exponentially.)  <br />So it was a great pleasure to discover this excellent biography, which illuminates not only his life but also the opera world from the 20s through the 50s.  His early life and training from his father are particularly interesting if you wonder how such a great talent was discovered and developed.  (The only question in my mind not answered is the extent to which his children inherited the incredible musical talent that was in his family for generations; that they perform is mentioned but never elaborated on.)  The book is well documented with quotes from his peers, and the authors do a splendid job of presenting the entire person with his strengths and weaknesses in a very objective way that holds the reader's interest from beginning to end.	2001-02-11

I can never decide if Sandra Brown is better at characterization or at plotting, because she excels at both.  THE SWITCH is up to her usual high standards of interesting, believable characters and excellent storytelling.  I may be a little biased toward this book, since I used to live in Dallas and she captured the flavor of my old neighborhood exactly.

She creates a very interesting hero and heroine, throws in some novel plot twists (so nice to see a hero and not just a heroine who is a little naive), and has some fascinating secondary characters.  One thing I particularly liked is that her characters show some real development and change during the course of the novel, which despite its length, is a very fast read because of the good writing and plotting by the author.  <br />Her knowledge of the period is quite good, and she enriches the novel with musical instruments, politics, and social issues of the Regency era.<br />Well done and highly recommended!	2001-01-04

This book is no exception.  She does an excellent job with plot and characterization in this book, and I am pleased that a fine Regency romance writer finally has received the recognition she deserves with a hardback version of her work.  I think she captures perfectly the familial expectations of a ducal heir in that time, as well as how few options were open to women in Regency England.  <br />I disagree entirely with the reviewers whose only quibble with this book is that it takes a long time for Jane and Jocelyn to resolve their differences and hurt feelings; quite the contrary, I found this to be entirely realistic, both for these characters and for human nature in general.  <br />Another thing I appreciate that Balogh always does in her books is to remain true to the period in which she is writing, and she doesn't insert contemporary language, thoughts, or manners into her work.<br />Bravo, Mary!

This is the first Goldsmith book I've read, though I did see and enjoy &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; movie.  It has interesting and believeable female characters, slimeball husbands, and a fabulous revenge plot, all of which make it entirely enjoyable in the hands of a very accomplished writer.  While I personally like my hiss! boo! villians a little more nuanced, watching them receive their comeuppance was extremely satisfying.  Goldsmith understands real female bonding.  Her sub-theme of what happens when women's idealistic dreams are shattered, and how they must become independent to achieve lasting happiness, adds a certian poignancy to the book.

This second novel continues with the characters from the first book, and it is always fun to see the character development from novel to novel.

This is one of the BEST self-help books I've ever read about relationships.  The author explains the different types of love relationships -- what makes them work, what makes them fail, and why people are drawn to others -- and it is amazing how quickly the reader can apply the categories to past and present amours.  The author uses examples that the reader can easily relate to and understand.  This is extremely valuable information, and I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever failed at romantic relationships in the past and would like to succeed at one (just one!) in the future.

He shows flashes of being interesting, but I didn't think he was as well-developed, nor as dashing, as he could have been.  While he had an edge to his personality, it was more mean-spirited than dark and dangerous.  As to the heroine, I worry about a woman who finds meanness and boorishness attractive.  However, the humor and an entertaining plot make this a worthwhile purchase, and the aunt and butler are both gems.	2000-11-23

With that disclaimer, I reallyenjoyed this book and thought the ending had a very nice twist to it. Did I see the ending coming?  If I had wanted to, perhaps, but I was content to let the writer do her job without trying to puzzle it out too much in advance.  I thought the characterizations and plot were both good, though the characters--particularly the male ones--were not particularly sympathetic.  In fact, I think the writer has a strong feminist bent, which I appreciated, but male readers may not.  In short, a fun read.	2000-11-21

Coulter brings her excellent descriptive and action style to this novel of romantic suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your chair and guessing until the end.

I don't think it was as howlingly bad as some other reviewers, nor would I give it a great review.  I tend to lose interest very quickly when characters behave in a way that stretches the bounds of credibility.  For example:  The hero is so crazy about the heroine, and when she finally admits that she met him long ago, he doesn't press for details and just assumes it was his twin brother?  Give me a break.  No man is that incurious.  However, some of the other characterizations are pretty good, as is the plot.  I think this writer will improve with practice.

The characterizations were all quite good, and the plot moved along at rapid clip.  Howard is a very competent writer, at times inspired, and she adds some really nice humorous touches.  What I didn't like about it was the eagerness of the heroine to leap into bed with the hero so quickly.  Like, she's supposed to be smart, right?  There's nothing wrong with using raging hormones as motivation; in fact, most romance novels are based on this.  But to me a book is so much more interesting when there's more tension and when the characters keep control of themselves longer; anticipation is half the fun.  While I think it could have been better, all in all, this was an enjoyable book.	2000-11-08

After her three former futuristic novels about Harmony, all of which were excellent, After Dark was a bit of a letdown.  The characters and the plot just weren't as solid as her previous efforts, and I found myself wanting more details of both than she supplied and wished she'd tied up all the loose ends.  Exploration and resolution of her experieces during the Lost Weekend would have made this a much better book than it was.  I would agree with other reviewers that the novel is richer if you've read the three preceeding ones.  With those disclaimers, however, this is still worth reading, because even less-than-the-best Jayne is better than most other romance writers, and she creates a nicely imaginative world for the reader.  I particularly liked the Fuzz creature.  All in all, not her best work, but certainly a decent effort.	2000-11-05

Her latest installment is no exception.  She builds an interesting love triangle with believable characters, and she follows faithfully the strictures of the Regency era as to honorable behavior.  She has a real feel for that period in history, and she does not attempt to &quot;modernize&quot; it as so many lesser writers of the genre do.  It was a pleasure to encounter several characters from her previous novels and hazard a guess as to which ones will be featured in her next book.  (I'm guessing the lady Annabelle, the third point of the love triangle.)  If you are a fan of the Regency period and good writing in general, this is a must read.	2000-11-05

She managed to create an authentic sense of time and place and mystery that were a delight to read, perhaps even more intriguing than the heroine and hero.  I was disappointed to discover that the sacred temple to which they trekked was a only product of Putney's fertile imagination, because I was ready to hop on a plane and go there!  The heroine is refreshingly different and a pleasant change.  I agree with other reviewers that the story lags a bit when China is left for Scotland, but this is still a very good book.	2000-11-02

However, one of the things I take issue with is that her hero strikes me as a tad wimpy and indecisive.  In short, he thinks like a not-to-bright romantic heroine, not a hero, and to me, he lacks the edge necessary to make this an excellent romance instead of merely a good one.  And while I am willing to suspend disbelief to a large degree, the willingness of the heroine in both this and Jaffe's previous novel to strip naked on some unbelievable pretext almost immediately upon meeting the hero is way too contrived.  However, even with these quibbles, I would recommending buying this book; this writer is very good and has the potential to be great, if she disregards her formula and starts to put more tension in her books.	2000-10-24

The characters and the plot become  richer, better developed, and more complex.  Haydon draws you into her  fantastic world, complete with a wonderful melancholy dragon, and you don't  want to leave it.  While I am awaiting the third book of the trilogy with  great eagerness, I hope that she will continue to use these characters in  later novels, because I want to see what else Rhapsody, Achmed, and  Grunthor are up to.  Even someone who normally doesn't read fantasies will  enjoy the splendid writing, plotting, and characterization!  She is a  wonderful storyteller.	2000-09-05

What a fortunate circumstance! I think Haydon is a brilliant writer with a wonderful imagination, and her characters are marvelous. She could have spent a little less time in the tree root, but that's my only quibble, and perhaps not a valid one, because that part of the book firmly establishes the relationship between three of the major characters. The sequel is even better, and I can't wait for the third installment! If you like outstanding writing, you won't regret buying this book.	2000-09-05
