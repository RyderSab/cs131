Its storyline was very straightforward with few tangential plots and their accompanying detail. After recently reading a couple books with much more convoluted (though equally enjoyable) plots, this book was an easy read. The timing was perfect as well. With the real world fearing the possibility of an avian flu pandemic again this year, that plot line gave the story a real-time feel.<br /><br />Contract agent (assassin) Liliane Mansfield, aka Denise Morel, takes out bad guy Salvatore Nervi in Paris for killing her best friends and \\"their\\" thirteen-year-old daughter, Zia. Because doing so means she's \\"left the reservation\\" to carry out a personal vendetta, she needs to be stopped. It also seems Nervi served a certain purpose in American clandestine affairs, and rubbing him out was a no-no. Enter handsome, swarthy, and earthy agent Lucas Swain. Swain is sent to Paris to hunt Lily down and to do the deed. However, the plot thickens as Lily wonders why her retired agent friends, Averill and Tina Joubrans, would take a job that put at risk the new life they'd created-a job that led to their deaths. Lily, determined to find the answer, remains in Paris at great risk to herself.<br /><br />Swain and Lily meet during a nasty shoot-out and, rather than put her down when he had the chance, Swain saves her and is immediately drawn to her intensity and bravery. (Well, her being good-looking helped, too.) They develop a bond, of sorts, out of circumstance and necessity. Their relationship grows and complicates things some, but it also brings about the opportunity to do in some really bad dudes if they work together. When they find out what was really behind the Joubrans mission, they know what they must do.<br /><br />Howard's writing is clear and her story easy to follow. There are some plot twists near the end, which make for good storytelling; but, for the most part, the story is about Lucas Swain, Lily Mansfield, and saving the world. However, one question remains throughout the book: Will Lucas kill Lily in the end?<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hills throughout the book: Will Lucas kill Lily in the end?    Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-10-11

I especially liked the \\"Tilok\\" proverbs at the beginning of each chapter (\\"The fat fox waits by the right rabbit hole.\\")<br /><br />It seems to me that David Dun writes primarily for men. There's a great deal of machismo in his work, along with high-powered, physical action and intrigue. UA moves right along and is loaded with detail and scene setting. It has the usual terrifying Dun plot with associated twists, turns, and deception. I am impressed with Dun's courage in having characters we've grown to care about die in his novels, and die horribly.<br /><br />In UA, the battle rages over possession of a certain gene vector that has an impact on human behavior, and the equally necessary substance to suppress the human immune system in order that it not destroy the vector upon implantation in the human brain and eventually kill the subject. This book gives a whole new meaning to the word \\"Chaperone.\\"<br /><br />As the back cover states, the center of the search is in the Amazon jungle. The global impact of how the findings will be used is what brings valiant Sam Wintripp into the picture. As is always the case, in the hands of good and wise leaders, the benefits of the newly found substance could serve mankind well. However, in the hands of evil individuals, like Devan Gaudet and his ilk, global destruction would be the only eventual outcome, though Gaudet's focus is the destruction of the U.S.<br /><br />Dun has been criticized for not developing his characters enough. Perhaps that is an indication of a genuine male tendency. From my experience, many men are more interested in how an individual functions in a given circumstance or what that person's motivations are in a particular situation than they are in fully knowing a person. Perhaps it is this tendency that is reflected in Dun's character development. All-in-all, a good read.

Patricia Cornwell writes so well that it's difficult to find a place to take a break when reading her novels. She is an expert at striking a balance between detail and the flow of the story. As a reader (and a writer), I believe I can learn much from her. The fact that she was a crime reporter for some years and a medical examiner, as well, adds authenticity to her stories. I'm looking forward to her next book, Predator, due out on October 25, 2005.<br /><br />When the daughter of powerful Washington politician, National Drug Policy Director, Pat Harvey, and boyfriend turn up missing, the services of Dr. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner of Richmond, New Jersey, are called upon once again. Four other couples have disappeared in similar fashion and have eventually been found murdered, all within a fifty-five mile radius of Williamsburg (Virginia). Scarpetta is called to a local rest area where Ms. Harvey's daughter, Deborah's, jeep has been found. When last seen, the couple was headed to the Harvey beach home in said jeep. A new investigation begins. Investigators, powerful politicians, and covert operations agents speculate as to whether or not this case is associated with Harvey's job or is it, perhaps, the fifth in a series of couple murders. As is often the case in Cornwell's stories, it becomes a question of who knows what and what is the real truth behind events and motives.<br /><br />The murders have been particularly gruesome, and when found, all that remains of the young people are some bones and clothing, along with a jack of hearts playing card. Also, in each case, the victims' shoes and socks cannot be found. Scarpetta and Richmond homicide detective, Pete Marino, follow various leads, spend considerable time speculating on the who and why of the murders, while investigative reporter, Abby Turnbull, seems to be terrified about something (Marino doesn't trust her). Ex-lover, Mark James, makes an appearance and temporarily heats up the personal side of Scarpetta's life again. In the end the killer is found and the murders solved, but at tremendous cost to the Harvey family and to others. An excellent read.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillance and temporarily heats up the personal side of Scarpetta's life again.

Fowler is now a seasoned author with a dozen books under her fingers. Her protagonist, Benni Harper, the folk museum curator and amateur sleuth, once again finds herself mixed up in a murder investigation. It seems someone has whacked the custodian of San Celina's First Baptist church, one Walt Adams. Benni is the one who finds him, and, as usual, the question is, why Walt?<br /><br />The story opens with Gramma, Dove Lyons, volunteering the two of them to take over directing the church's children in a production of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. However, this very adult work has been adapted as a children's musical play by the church's music director, Lily Sanders, and is to be this year's Christmas holiday offering. Lily has suddenly been called away on a family matter and will be gone for some time. It's early November and there is no time to waste in getting the children ready for the show.<br /><br />Benni is married to hunky police chief, Gabe (Gabriel) Ortiz, and there's lots going on in their relationship, the second marriage for each. When Gabe's look-alike cousin, Luis Ortiz, suddenly appears on the scene, things start out okay, but, eventually, Luis's presence creates serious anxiety in Gabe. Add to that Benni's involvement in the Walt Adams business, and the plot begins to get pretty thick.<br /><br />This book is easy to read and I would even suggest it for teens. It is not a gripping mystery. In fact, the mystery sometimes seems incidental to the stories of the lives of the book's many characters. However, it is well-written and fluid. (I don't usually mention editing errors because they exist in almost every book I read, including my own. This one, however, has more than the usual number, including two incidences of two words being repeated [ex., the thing the thing]. Finding such errors is what editing staffs are for and I would expect, after this many books by Fowler, her editors would make certain the copy was a clean as possible before printing).<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill.

The concept is still funny and fresh, and Stephanie and her Grandma Mazur are quite the pair. Stephanie and Joe Morelli are getting closer to getting closer, and Lula, the ex-ho, joins the Plum agency staff. One Kenny Mancuso is the main skipper. What seems to be a routine pick up quickly turns very, very ugly.<br /><br />We follow Stephanie around as she showers and changes clothes, has her Jeep stolen, showers and changes clothes, picks up some doughnuts (which by Ten Big Ones gets pretty old), gets herself in a tight spot, showers and changes clothes, tries not to succumb to Morelli's charm, showers and changes clothes, staves off creepy Spiro's (funeral director Constantine Stiva's stepson) advances, showers and changes clothes, and tries to keep Grandma Mazur from destroying everything around her. Morelli comes to dinner at the folks' and Stephanie's mother begins to like him.<br /><br />Kenny Mancuso is a bad dude. He cuts off people's body parts, in the funeral home, no less! He and childhood buddies, Spiro and Moogey Bues, have some plans for military weapons, but Moogey ends up dead. Joe Morelli has known the `boys' since they were all kids and he knows how dangerous Kenny can be. He spends a great deal of time in this book following Stephanie around as she looks for Kenny. This is as much to protect her from herself as anyone else.<br /><br />Two for the Dough is a very light read; a great beach read, rainy day read, or fun to read when you don't really want to do anything, but you hate to just blow off time (it's too precious a commodity). Two for the Dough is fun, menacing, and sexy.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-08-20
US	25509285	REH1XRYGMZ39V	078601637X	373598398	The Black Silent	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Great movie material.	This was my first David Dun book, but it won't be my last. Protagonist, Sam Wintripp, a hunky mix of Scottish and American Indian blood, is in the San Juan Islands (Seattle area) recuperating from a particularly bad time that included the torture and killing of his wife, Anna. He is also the nephew of molecular scientist, Ben Anderson, who, in the opening pages, is being attacked as he works to fix a malfunctioning pump in an underwater octopus pen at his corporation's lab. (Author Dun describes the attack in intense detail as he does often in this book. I thought at times the descriptions were a little too much. I could've done with less, but the pace of the action and the seriousness of the book's themes kept me reading.)<br /><br />Anderson is a smart man and eventually overcomes his attacker. He concludes shortly thereafter that the problem with the saltwater system was a setup and he thinks he knows why. He's about to leave the Sanker Foundation for which he works. He's discovered the people he works for are unscrupulous, greedy, and quite possibly willing to murder to get their hands on his research. Small wonder. Anderson's research suggests that the world's ocean bottoms hold the key to human youth retention, while, at the same time, the possibility of catastrophic death from the over-release of methane gas from the same depths. He has created the ARCLES files and six precious vials. What's in the vials? What does it all mean? What will be the consequences of the world having such knowledge?<br /><br />Shortly after Ben escapes the octopus pen attack, he is kidnapped. Haley Walthers, who he and his deceased wife, Helen, raised, is now also a scientist. However, Haley has unjustly been disgraced and can no longer practice her science. Soon Haley and Sam are looking for Ben and trying to keep bad guy Garth Frick and his thugs from killing them all and stealing Ben's research.<br /><br />There's a great deal of danger and intrigue in this book, which I love! Sam is a superman, but Haley Walthers is no slouch. In addition to being a top-notch scientist, she can pilot both boat and plane like a pro and has the guts to match. There's so much in this book it boggles the mind. If you like science fiction, international intrigue, and sexual tension, you'll love this book. Oh, and David, thanks for the map. It was a great help.<br /><br />P.S.: (If any of Dun's books with Sam Wintripp in them are ever made into movies (and they should be) I'd like to see Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson play Sam.

No matter how one may try to copy or write like another author, it can't be done entirely; and surely no one will ever match Alexander McCall Smith's unique, quietly colorful, and charming style. His fictional characters truly come to life through his immensely creative hand. In the von Igelfeld series, Smith breathes life into some otherwise very dull, overly erudite personalities, giving them humor, a twisted kind of bravery, and even worldliness.<br /><br />In this installment there are two stories. This first is On Being Light Blue (can you figure out why this title?). Von Igelfeld decides he must go to Cambridge in England after friend and fellow philologist, Prof Dr Dr Florianus Prinzel, asks him on his birthday what he would really like to do. \\"I should like to go to Cambridge,\\" he announces. \\"And, indeed, one day I shall go there.\\" He does, and the rest of the story is pure von Igelfeld coping with life in England and dealing with the people and customs of that strange country (from his point of view, of course).<br /><br />Next, in the title story, At the Villa of Reduced Circumstances, von Igelfeld returns from Colombia and is informed that a copy of his precious work, \\"Portuguese Irregular Verbs,\\" had been requested by the Colombian Embassy. The upshot of which is an invitation from the embassy's cultural attach&eacute; to visit Colombia and receive a Distinguished Corresponding Fellowship award, the highest honor the Colombian Academy of Letters can bestow. Of course von Igelfeld must go and receive this most prestigious award. If you've been reading this entertaining series, you can guess that the trip will be...well, interesting, though perhaps `bizarre' is a better word. As always with McCall Smith's tales, you must digest the written word to truly enjoy the flavor.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-08-20

Three of the four Septembers have a really rough summer in this Second Summer of the Sisterhood. They have much to learn about what it means to be their respective mothers. The fourth embarks on an odyssey to find out more about who she is and who her deceased mother was as a person. She finds an endearing love in the grandmother she scarcely remembers. Once again, the pants travel back and forth among them, though I felt their significance less in this book than in the first one (and they must be getting really filthy, too).<br /><br />Lena, Carmen and Tibby remain in Maryland, while Bridget goes to Alabama. She has had a difficult year after events last summer, and all are greatly concerned for her. She has put on weight, dyed her luscious blond hair brown and has retreated into a cocoon of emotional agony. The loss of her mother when she was eleven has cost her more than she can understand or realize. Bee's (Bridget's nickname) father is an emotional cripple, unable to ease the way for either of his children. Carmen's mother, Christina, has a new boyfriend. You can imagine what Carmen and her self-righteous temper can do with that! Tibby is attending a summer film class at a nearby university. She learns about true friendship, the hard way, of course. Young friend, Bailey, who died last summer, comes to her rescue, posthumously. Lena and Kostos...oh my, oh my.<br /><br />These stories can be very helpful to teens, both boys and girls. While I find it hard to believe most teens are as disrespectful toward their mothers as these characters are...at least I don't remember it that way myself...there are wise lessons to be learned within the pages of the Sisterhood series. Ann Brashares writes beautifully, and the sayings at the beginning of each chapter add much to the book's interest and value. One of the most thought-provoking ones this time: Fear is the darkroom where negatives are developed. Think about it...hard.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-08-09

In this installment in the life of self-absorbed and unworld-wise philologist von Igelfeld, he is first mistaken for a German veterinarian, Dr Martin Igelfold, on a visit to Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he is to give a speech (The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs). Later, this error in identification, which von Igelfeld does not correct, results in disaster (A Leg to Stand on). Next, von Igelfeld becomes quite distressed when his colleague, Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer, writes an unfavorable critique about von Igelfeld's precious book, Portuguese Irregular Verbs. He goes to extremes (how surprising) to undermine his critic and, as usual, makes matters worse for a time (On the Couch). Then there's the trip to Italy for the month of August with friends Professor Dr Dr Florianus Prinzel and his wife, Ophelia. During his travels, he meets some interesting characters and takes on a monumental responsibility which, of course, he handles badly (The Bones of Father Christmas). Finally, he decides to go on a lecture cruise, not because he likes them or is honored to have been invited to lecture (actually, he hates cruises), but because both Unterholzer and Prinzel declare how delighted each would be to take his place. What transpires is true von Igelfeld! (The Perfect Imperfect)<br /><br />If you expect the von Igelfeld series to be the same as The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, you are in error. They are very different, but McCall Smith's sense of humor and masterful writing will keep you very well entertained!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-08-08

The book opens with a strange and bewildering episode for Precious wherein someone has found his way into her home and ends up hiding under her bed. He is almost crushed under the weight of a sagging mattress when Precious, being of traditional build, decides to take a nap. However, the intruder escapes...without his trousers, which get snagged on a piece of metal under the bed. The next day, Precious finds a pumpkin by her fence near where she'd hung the trousers (in case the owner should be looking for them). The trousers are gone. She wonders whether or not there's a connection between the appearance of the pumpkin and the missing trousers for some time.<br /><br />While the intruder episode is troubling, Precious Ramotswe becomes entangled in a dilemma of her own making as the result of something she did, or, rather, didn't do, many years ago. This troublesome matter threatens her happiness with Mr J. L. B. Matekoni. Grace Makutsi, on the other hand, starts taking dancing lessons and embarks on a new adventure of the heart; well, maybe.<br /><br />The agency is doing well as is Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. So well, in fact, that more help is needed. What to do, especially when Charlie quits in a huff. What's up with him? Both Mma Makutsi's and Mma Ramotswe's wits are needed again in Cheerful Ladies, as always, to help solve the problems and dilemmas of daily life.

Rowling is a remarkable storyteller with a vivid imagination and the astonishing ability to put her images into words for all of us to enjoy. She is also a well-organized writer. With so much detail to keep track of over six books, she can reach back to the smallest detail and bring it forward to excellent use (I'd share some with you, but you'll discover them for yourself as you read). Rowling also has a way of imparting wisdom through her characters' conversations and her descriptions of events (taking in the wisdom of Dumbledore is a side benefit of the Harry Potter series). Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince also sets up the next book perfectly. It is clear well before the end of this book that Harry has a big job to do before the whole tale is told. The next, and final (?), installment in Harry's world will certainly be exciting.<br /><br />Love, loyalty, adventure, and the worst kind of betrayal are found within the covers of this book. Harry's feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny, take on a life of their own in Half-Prince, while Ron and Hermoine continue to have a love-dislike relationship; but it's clear to us undying romantics what lies behind their often contentious behavior toward one another. Ron even resorts to an outrageous snogging relationship with Lavender Brown to prove himself. If it weren't so true of hormone-raging, image-conscious, teenaged behavior, it would be laughable.<br /><br />We learn much about Lord Voldemort's life and how he came to his evil ways (though one might think Harry could've turned out like him with his own tragic early life; so why didn't he?). We also learn how Voldemort plans to make himself immortal.  The wizard world is now under greater threat from the Dark Lord than it has been for a long time. Wizard folks are not safe in their homes or their places of work and play without considerable charms and enchantments. Hogwarts is under grave threat from Death Eaters wanting to get inside, and with a little inside help, they might make it. Who's to be trusted? Who is not? Can one trust too much? Can even a wise wizard place his trust in the wrong person? These are all questions the reader will ask him/herself all the way through Half-Prince, and the answers will not all be comforting ones.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillake it. Who's to be trusted?

This is only the second Macomber book I've read, the first being The Shop on Blossom Street (See review of June 22, 2005). A Good Yarn is a continuation of the story set in a yarn shop on Blossom Street in Seattle opened by Lydia Hoffman, two-time cancer survivor. This book is about a new knitting class Lydia decides to offer. This one is for making socks (guess what my family members will get this year for Christmas? Last year it was scarves).<br /><br />In A Good Yarn we meet three new ladies. Elise Beaumont, bitter long-time divorcee with a grown daughter and two adorable grandsons, Luke and John. Her ex is about to turn up after thirty-seven years. She's not at all happy about that, especially since he'll be staying with their daughter where Elise, herself, is living.  Bethanne Hamlin's husband tells her on Valentine's Day he no longer loves her and has a new honey...well, they've been having an affair for one-and-a-half years, but who knew?...everyone but Elise. Bethanne has two great kids, Andrew and Annie, but Annie is VERY ANGRY with dear old dad and young Tiffany and isn't afraid to show it. Then there's Courtney Pulanski who's had to come to Seattle to live with her grandmother while her dad is in Brazil as a bridge architect. Courtney's mom died a few years back and she and her older sister and brother have been dealing with that tragedy. Since Courtney's siblings are both in college, Courtney had to leave her school and friends in Chicago for her senior year in high school while her dad was away. Add to those woes the fact that she's gained about twenty-five pounds and you get the picture as to her emotional state.<br /><br />These three very different ladies of widely varying ages come to Lydia's class and over the course of time and events become friends as did Jacqueline, Carol and Alix in The Shop on Blossom Street. There are some good men in this book, too, and one real jerk...you'll figure that out when you read it. I love these stories. They've helped rekindle my interest in knitting and, while the outcome in every character's situation is almost completely predictable, I was eager to read on until I found out exactly what happened in the lives of each.<br /><br />Macomber has a very easy writing style, and her characters, while purely fictional (as she takes some pains to say), are very real. We all know people much like those in A Good Yarn; and the storyline is well-crafted with each chapter about one or the other of the primary characters. Maybe if we exported more stories like A Good Yarn, the other good people of the world would see a more realistic picture of everyday Americans, people like Lydia, Elise, Bethanne, Courtney, Andrew, Annie, Brad, Maverick, Matt, David, et al. Who knows, the good feeling might even be catching. One can only hope.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillinterest in knitting and, while the outcome in every character's situation is almost completely predictable, I was eager to read on until I found out exactly what happened in the lives of each.

This is a woman's book, particularly one for those who knit, and who love working with yarn. There are many references to the process of knitting and the historical importance of knitting in the life of mankind.<br /><br />The character of Sandra Fildes is self-involved, seriously uptight, emotionally needy, and unable to relate well to people on a personal level. She is also a wordsmith, a writer, and a woman interested in the study of language and its nuances, along with that of textiles. When the story opens, Sandra's beloved husband, Jack, through whom she's lived vicariously for many years, has been dead of cancer for about nine months and she struggles each day to keep going. She visits an art gallery where she is struck by a glass dress. To demonstrate Bartlett's ability to meaningfully and effectively weave words together, following is the description (page 44) of the dress as seen through Sandra's eyes: \\"But this glass dress, this was a dress for a woman with a cutting voice and a snapping handbag, someone who ordered people around so they wouldn't see who she was. A dress for a woman who was always holding in a shriek but would let out only bits at a time, slivers of misery from behind those tight glass beads.\\" Wow! I thought as I read the paragraph that the description could be of Sandra herself.<br /><br />At any rate, Sandra and polar opposite Martha McKenzie, knitter extraordinaire, friendly and giving, but also dealing with her own deep-seated pain over losses in her life, meet under unusual circumstances. Over time, through a shared interest in things knitted, they develop an unlikely bond that in the end is healing to both. There are some very dramatic episodes through which these two women must travel, and while other characters come and go, it is the interplay between these two women that snags the heart strings and takes the reader along on a rocky journey to friendship. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. One question each reader will want to attempt to answer: Who is \\"the man?\\"<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillakes the reader along on a rocky journey to friendship.

Under 'Book Description' on this book's Amazon site, reference is made to the \\"rarified world\\" of Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld the great philologist (one who studies literary texts to determine their original form and meaning; an older word for 'linguistics'. Can one imagine anything more tedious? or bo-o-r-r-ing?). Rarified, indeed, it is...almost out of the stratosphere. Our dear doctor lives so completely in his head that he misses the point of almost all that goes on around him in the world of the mundane. He is also extraordinarily socially inept. In one instance, he is so concerned that he do things \\"properly\\" in approaching the lady he would like to make his wife that in the five weeks he waits to make his initial approach, a friend, on a little faster track, has pursued the lady and asked her to marry him. She has accepted.<br /><br />Portuguese Irregular Verbs is comprised of eight short stories about events in the lives of three philologists who are friends. Dr von Igelfeld is the primary character. His friends are fellow philologists, Professor Dr Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer and Professor Dr Dr Florianus Prinzel. Germans all.<br /><br />The stories of Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld are nothing like those of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The humor is very dry and, for some, will be non-existent, or close to it. I think one needs to have lived a while and known a fair number of people to really appreciate this book. I believe that as a result of having read this first book in the series, I better understand a couple people I actually know, and have known for years! I also think I'll delay that trip to Venice I was thinking of taking.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Mr. Smith's ability to write that he can take such stuffy, one-dimensional people and show them in a humorous light. He is simply terrifico!!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-07-10

This is only the second book I've read in the Stephanie Plum series. I started with Ten Big Ones, which I enjoyed, but, for my money, this one is definitely better. It's funnier and fresher (perhaps the rumors that others are participating in the writing of the series have some merit). Evanovich's sense of humor rides high in Four to Score, much more so than in Ten Big Ones. Little things struck me, like the description of Mrs. Nowicki as \\"faded glory in a bathrobe,\\" the fact that Stephanie's grandfather \\"went heavenward to dine with Elvis,\\" and Stephanie's reference to \\"Catholic guilt\\" when she awakes one Sunday morning feeling \\"apologetic\\" and thinks about the \\"multifaceted experience\\" of being Catholic: \\"If you lose the faith,\\" she thinks, \\"chances are you'll keep the guilt, so it isn't as if you've been skunked altogether.\\"<br /><br />FTS is full of Stephanie's wacky, unconventional thought processes and antics that had me LOL frequently. There's the requisite mayhem and misdeeds with one Maxine Nowicki as the skipper. Max's boyfriend, Eddie Kuntz, would like to find her for his own reasons, but there's more to Maxine's skipping than meets the eye. Maxine's mother gets scalped (she lives), someone else loses a finger, and one unfortunate person is murdered. While all this bad business is going on, the book as a whole is more comical than it is spine tingling.<br /><br />Another character on a similar wavelength as Stephanie Plum, though wackier and more outside the mainstream, is Christy Tillery French's Natasha Chamberlain, sexy, bumbling bodyguard and protagonist in French's The Bodyguard. Natasha and Stephanie have a lot in common, but Natasha is far more of a loose cannon. There's a hunky guy, Jonce Striker (kind of a cross between Morelli and Ranger), and an assortment of zany, oddball characters. So, if you like wild and crazy girls doing tough guy jobs, add Nattie Chamberlain to your list.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-28

In this installment, Mma Ramotswe finds out what's behind the poisoning of family members of The Government Man who comes to her office convinced his sister-in-law is the culprit. Before the mystery is solved, however, Mma Ramotswe becomes ill herself while visiting the family in question. While Mma Ramotswe is away, Mma Makutsi is hired by the head of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest to see which of the four finalists is deserving of the title. Since both women are perceptive, as well as clever, each uncovers the truth in due time. Meanwhile, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni continues to be vexed by his two apprentices who seem far more interested in sloughing off and going on about girls than they are about fixing cars. He has also begun to exhibit strange behavior. Is he having second thoughts about marrying Mma Ramotswe?<br /><br />The ease with which Alexander McCall Smith tells his stories continues to attract my devoted attention. His descriptions of Mma Precious Ramotswe's Africa and his portrayal of her personality, and that of his other characters, are delightful, often amusing, and full of wise, philosophical musings. One observation made by Mma Ramotswe about a maid in the house of the poisoning goes thus: \\"Here was another with a motive, she reflected, but the thought was absurd. This was an honest woman. Her face was open and she smiled as she spoke. Secrets left shadows on the face, and there were none there.\\" I re-read the words \\"secrets left shadows on the face\\" several times, pondering the depth of wisdom in their simplicity.<br /><br />This is the third in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, and each one is as good as the last. It's also clear that Mr. Smith has a love of Africa (Botswana in particular) that clearly shines through in his descriptions of the land and the customs of its people.

We have learned in previous books that this lady is very smart, very capable, and willing to work hard. While Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni is recovering from depression, Mma Makutsi takes over the running of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Suddenly, the two apprentices shape up big time, and Mma can even fix cars!<br /><br />What a remarkable lady is Mma Makutsi. Remarkable and lonely. Then she meets Mr. Bernard Selelipeng and...but, I'm getting ahead of myself. While Mma Makutsi is busy with two businesses, Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (manager of one, assistant detective with the other) she realizes she needs to open her own business if she truly wants a secure future. She hits upon the idea of a typing school for men. Classes could be held in the evening, which wouldn't interfere with her other two jobs. Mr. Bernard Selelipeng is one of her students, and therein lies that story. Two other men play a prominent role in this book: one who wants to atone for past sins; the other, a pompous windbag who thinks he is a better detective than any woman could possibly be. We also learn more about how the two orphans, Motholeli and Puso, taken in by Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni in Tears of the Giraffe, are adjusting to their new life.<br /><br />My only fear as I read these wonderful books is whether or not I'm reading/pronouncing the proper names of people and places correctly. But then, in our ever-increasing global society, we're all going to have to learn how to properly pronounce one another's names, somehow.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-27

Early twenties something, Natasha Chamberlain, is a wild and crazy girl, similar to Evanovich's Stephanie Plum, but more extreme...is that possible??? Anyway, Natasha has been working at an agency whose raison d'etre is to protect the lives, behinds and resources of various and sundry individuals, some of whom may be of questionable character.<br /><br />When the story opens, Natasha is the office manager of the agency, wears suits to work, a subdued hairstyle, and glasses. Then, one day, she is called upon to serve as a bodyguard for the very good friend of one of the agency owners. After that, all hell breaks loose. Her superiors do not tell Natasha that her services are only intended for one evening, for a glamorous dinner where the object of the protection, one Roger Valentine, is to be the honoree and who needs protection from someone who has threatened to kill him. Well, Natasha proceeds to make a real mess of things at the dinner, but has the presence of mind to have Roger sign an agreement (before attending the dinner) that he will require her body guarding services until the individual who's threatened him is discovered. So when her bosses attempt to relieve her of her bodyguard duties and put her back at a desk, she explains, as only she can do...belligerently...that she has no intention of returning to office manager duty and shows them the signed document.<br /><br />You will need a great deal of energy to keep up with Natasha's antics and the patience required of Jonce Striker, one of her bosses (and the guy who makes Natasha's heart go thump-thump), as they attempt to protect Roger. A romance develops between Natasha and Striker, Natasha fights with her mother (constantly) and the agency's two primary bodyguards, Bigun and Pit, provide additional comic relief, as if any more is needed. This book is fast moving, full of spitfire dialogue, and oozes tantalizing escapades. Have fun with it!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillth it!    Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-22

This is a feel-good women's book about four very different women who become friends while taking a knitting class from one of them. Lydia Hoffman, twice a cancer survivor, opens A Good Yarn on the last Tuesday of April (any current year). The buildings on Blossom Street, where the store is located, are being renovated, a major undertaking in this particular Seattle neighborhood. Lydia advertises for interested parties to participate in a knitting class on Friday afternoons. Jacqueline Donovan, Carol Girard and Alix (yes, with an \\"i\\") take her up on her offer. Jacqueline is a major b..../snob whose marriage has been cold for years and who intensely dislikes her new daughter-in-law who has had the audacity to become pregnant; Carol Girard and her husband, Doug, are desperate for a baby; and Alix Townsend is a troubled girl who still dreams of a boy she \\"loved\\" in sixth grade.<br /><br />These four women grow together over the course of about nine months, and we, the readers, accompany them on their journey of growth as individuals, a group, and as knitters. There is a pattern for a baby blanket given at the front of the book and it is also the first project the women undertake in their class. Macomber also occasionally throws in a pithy saying about knitting, such as \\"In the hands of a knitter, yarn becomes the medium that binds the heart and soul,\\" attributed to Robin Villiers-Furze, The Needleworks Company, Port Orchard, Washington.<br /><br />Macomber's writing style is easy and the story flows well. Her formatting style is to alter chapters by woman; something here about Lydia, something there about Jacqueline, and so on. Oh, and then there's the guys...and what guys they are. Brad Goetz falls in love with Lydia, Reese Donovan still loves his wife, Doug Girard is one patient fellow, and Jordan Turner, well, he's just A-OK! After digesting this book for a few days, I've decided that among the general flavor of the book which I liked a great deal, one of the best things about The Shop on Blossom Street was the guys! What a terrific bunch of hunks, all loving and patient and hot!

What amazed me the most about this book was how quickly (and easily) Jamie Reidy made the decision to spend most of his sales career with Pfizer playing hooky. It seemed to me that if he expended the same amount of energy doing his job as he did trying to avoid it, he would have been considerably more successful (more $$) than he was...and he did okay.<br /><br />The book made interesting reading and I found myself quite intrigued, turning the pages to find out more about the inner workings of the pharma sales rep culture. As a woman, I can see where perhaps I should've taken this road rather than that of an educator, but then you know what they say about hindsight. Jamie makes it quite clear that women make the best reps because most doctors are males. It seems even the women doctors prefer female reps...sisterhood?<br /><br />Anyway, read this book and you will look at your doctor's office differently in the future. I was a little disappointed at the end of the book because it ended quite suddenly. I was hoping for the gory details of Jamie's departure from Pfizer, but perhaps there were none (?) In the epilogue he mentions that he'd quit Pfizer \\"two months earlier,\\" but there were no details. If you're a sports fan, you'll enjoy Jamie's frequent references to sports events and personalities. He writes with humor (I found myself LOL several times). All-in-all, a good read.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-17

In a few short weeks, the sixth Harry Potter book will be released (July 16, 2005). I am eagerly awaiting my copy of HP and the Half-Blood Prince, which I have pre-ordered. J. K. Rowling continues to amaze with her writing talent, her creativity and her extraordinary organizational skills. Her prose is easy to read, her fantasies full blown and (once again) she successfully keeps track of the details as the story of Harry Potter, his friends and enemies, continues. At 870 pages, the Order of the Phoenix is the longest and I thought a bit too attentive to detail in the early stages, but that did not diminish my admiration for the author or the content of the story.<br /><br />Harry is now fifteen and in his fifth year at Hogwarts. He spends almost the entire book in a bad mood, not unusual for a teenage boy. He is introduced to the Order of the Phoenix and eventually learns they are charged with protecting him. In this book, Harry has a recurring dream of walking down a long corridor toward a closed door, which eventually opens for him, leading to all sorts of trouble and horror. Meanwhile, Hagrid is missing for a time. He returns somewhat worse for wear, but at least he's back, to the great relief of Hermoine, Ron and Harry. A dreadful witch wizard in the form of Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge arrives at Hogwarts and much of the story involves her treachery there. Harry's first introduction to her is at his hearing, brought about by his breaking the rules and using magic during his summer vacation on Privet Drive.<br /><br />As with the earlier books, pay close attention as you read. You will need the information provided early in the story to fully grasp the events at the end of The Order of the Phoenix as Harry continues to fight against the dark forces of the wizard world.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-17

The tribulations. Ann Brashares' novel The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is about four very good teenaged girlfriends. Friends since before they were born...within seventeen days of one another, beginning at the end of August and ending in mid-September. Their mothers took an aerobic class for pregnant mothers and became the \\"Septembers\\" fifteen years ago. The girls carried on the moniker as they grew up, even as their mothers grew apart and one of their mothers died and one set of parents divorced.<br /><br />The story takes place during the summer preceding the girls' sixteenth birthday. It's the first time they will be separated for any length of time. Three will go away. One will remain in Maryland. Just before the time of parting arrives, one of the girls acquires a pair of pants in a secondhand shop. As each girl tries them on, the pants miraculously fit their varying figures perfectly, which gives each girl a strong dose of confidence and a sense of belonging to one another even stronger than before. The girls decide to share the pants over the summer by mailing them back and forth. Rules are made as to how the pants should be cared for, who gets them when, and so forth. The rest of the story takes the reader through the events of the summer for Lena, who goes to visit her grandparents in Greece with her sister Effie; Bridget, who goes to soccer camp in Baja, California; Carmen, who goes to South Carolina to spend the summer with her father; and Tibby, who stays home in Maryland.  Keep a box of tissues handy.<br /><br />At the back of the book is a list of discussion questions and an interview with the author, along with a list of additional reading for young adults. A prologue for The Second Summer of the Pants is also included. The movie version of this book is also now in theaters around the nation.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-13

Her husband, who stood by her through her worst times, must be a saint. Laurel's blessings and her scars show through in her story. For anyone going through a difficult time, this book could provide solace in knowing there are others who have survived long periods of darkness and returned to the light.<br /><br />I was especially taken by Ms. Johnson's poetry, which is interspersed with the book's prose.

I read Tears of the Giraffe first (see Amazon review of 5/24/05), and loved it. I would recommend, as with all series, that you begin here with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. This is where you get the full background about how the agency got started, about its proprietress, Precious Ramotswe; Mma Ramotswe's beloved Daddy, Obed; and her friend J.L.B. Matekoni, and others. You'll fall in love with Mma Ramotswe's Africa as well.<br /><br />The story takes place in Botswana, a country just north of South Africa. Botswana is a democracy and has done very well for itself since the mid-sixties when it gained its independence. Precious Ramotswe, who is always called Mma Ramotswe, opens the first and only detective agency in Africa run by a woman, after the death of her father. She is a very clever woman, quite plump, too, which is a good thing...she refers to her build as the \\"traditional\\" build of the Botswana female. She is very proud of her size and her brain, which she puts to good use in helping people solve the \\"problems in their lives.\\"<br /><br />The book is a series of events of a social, personal, and business nature and moves easily along and keeps the reader interested. The best way I can describe McCall Smith's writing is that it has class, from his vocabulary to his style. The story flows smoothly from one page to another; one chapter to another; and even horrible events in people's life are served up with a kind of dignity as presented from the viewpoint of Mma Ramotswe. While Mma is a very gracious and polite lady, she can be ruthless when dealing with vile, evil, and unscrupulous individuals. In the end, she is not afraid of anybody or anything! I'd love to meet her...if she were only real!!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-08

Alexander McCall Smith begins a new series with The Sunday Philosophy Club. Be advised that the story has nothing to do with \\"the club.\\" It is only mentioned once or twice. It is, however, about Isabel Dalhousie, an early forties, single woman of independent means (as others have said) who can't seem to keep from getting involved in the business of others. For those who want to compare this book to The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, please do not. It is a totally different animal...other than both protagonists are single women who are very curious about everybody and everything and who have been left the financial means (by their respective fathers) to do pretty much what they want with their lives.<br /><br />Isabel Dalhousie sees a young man fall to his death. She is the last person he \\"sees\\" as he plummets past her in Usher Hall during an evening concert break. Isabel ponders the why of the tragic event and this leads her to some assumptions and a certain amount of intrigue until she eventually finds out what really happened. Isabel has a niece named Cat (lots of Cats around these days, it seems) whom she loves as a daughter. A subplot in this book surrounds Isabel's dislike of Cat's current boyfriend, Toby. She much prefers old boyfriend, Jamie. She sticks her nose in this business as well and the results are...well, you'll find out.<br /><br />This book is not a light read. It is full of Isabel's philosophical musings, particularly having to do with ethics. After all, she is the editor of Edinburgh's highly esteemed Review of Applied Ethics and, as such, spends a great deal of time reading papers presented to her for inclusion in the review. She often takes off on her own thoughts about the subject at hand. Some may find this ponderous and a bit abstruse (yes, there are lots of words like this in TSPC). Read it for what it is and keep a dictionary handy. While Isabel has some of Precious Ramotswe's fine characteristics as a person, this book is NOT The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Scottish edition!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hilltective Agency, Scottish edition!

There's Nana Kettle, mother of Frank Kettle, ex-husband of Maxine (Max) Kettle, mother of the wackiest triplets on the planet, Lynnette (Lyn), Catriona  (Cat), and Gemma Kettle. The girls are long-legged and beautiful, but that's where the similarity ends. Author Moriarty grew up in a family with six children, she being the eldest, so she probably has an excellent concept of what chaos in a family means.<br /><br />The scene is Sydney, Australia, and the story is about the triplets as they approach their thirty-fourth birthday. There are snippets of their lives from birth, including the divorce of their parents when they were six, the death of the fianc&eacute; of one of the girls; marriages, childbirth, miscarriage, unfaithful husbands, etc. There's a good mix of happy/sad/mundane events, but mostly these three girls and their family members try, like most of us, to survive one another. It's quite a hoot. However, there is one aspect of this story I found very disturbing. Since art imitates life, we all know of situations like the one portrayed in the book. All I can say is \\"Get out!\\"<br /><br />Ms. Moriarty not only used prose to tell her story, she included emails between these very modern sisters, which I thought was very clever. In addition, she included vignettes by people who had been \\"exposed\\" to the sisters over the course of their lives. These vignettes were presented in italicized text. I liked the feature as it gave the unusual view of the story's characters from people outside the story line.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-05

It is written with the tenderness and longing of one who's experienced the tragic loss of a love as Patterson did in his twenties. A major departure from his usual fare, the reader sees a whole new side of this talented, successful writer.<br /><br />Tall, beautiful Katie Wilkinson, senior editor at a highly regarded New York publishing house, falls in love with Matt Harrison, the poet. She met him when she bought his first volume of poetry from a small Boston literary agency. As their love grew, she thought they had it all, especially a future, but Matt wouldn't talk about his past. Then one day it was over. Suddenly. Sadly. And Katie didn't understand why. Then she receives a package--a diary with a note from Matt. \\"Dear Katie, I'm so sorry for what I allowed to happen....\\" She reads the diary from cover to cover. She learns about Suzanne and Nicholas, and knows what she must do.<br /><br />The resounding message in this story is that life is a game in which each of us juggles five balls: work, family, health, friends and integrity. When each of us comes to understand that work is a rubber ball that bounces back if dropped, but the other four, made of glass, must be juggled very carefully so as not to be scuffed, nicked or shattered, we understand the true meaning and purpose behind this touching, tearful love story.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-02

In this book, twenty-year-married Jessie Sullivan is at the center of such a controversy/conflict, an inner storm.<br /><br />The story takes place on fictitious Egret Island, South Carolina, where Jessie goes to tend to her mother from whom she's been estranged and who has just done something that has shocked all who know her. But, then, is it a shock or do the people who know her well know why she did it? Upon arriving on the island, Jessie meets Brother Thomas, a monk who will soon take his final vows for his marriage to God. The attraction is instantaneous. You can guess what happens soon after, and the agony and the ecstasy of their respective choices. Intertwined with their story is the need for Jessie to find out why her mother appeared to have died, emotionally, the same day her father did when Jessie was only nine years old. The change in their mother on that day (Jessie has a younger brother, Mike) was both a mystery and a cause of great pain to the two children as they grew to adulthood. Mike's answer to the pain was to move to the West coast, and stay there.<br /><br />Sue Kidd writes beautifully and very descriptively. An example: after she and husband, Hugh, make love for the first time after the birth of their daughter, Dee, Jessie's thoughts stir a loving picture within her, one \\"followed by a little flourish of happiness spreading open like an exotic paper fan in the center of my chest.\\" Ummmm. Nice.<br /><br />There are a number of issues of right vs. wrong, should we have vs. should we not have, and certainly those of love, betrayal and forgiveness as others have noted. I was engrossed in this book and I believe most others who read it will be also.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-06-01

His No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is fast becoming one of my favorites. Simply told, gently written, and charming in its descriptions of the people and places in the Botswana of Precious Ramotswe, makes McCall Smith's approach to storytelling unique and refreshing.<br /><br />Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only woman detective, and owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. However, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's maid, Florence Peko, is not at all happy with the news and conjures up some plans of her own for Mma Ramotswe. The main plot surrounds Mma Ramotswe's search for the son of an American woman who had been missing for ten years. The woman, Andrea Curtin, does not expect her son to be alive, but she does want to know what happened to him. Mrs (no period) Curtin's husband is now dead, and all previous efforts to find her son have failed, so she pays a visit to the agency. Add to that the troubles of Mr Letsenyane Badule who wants to know if his wife is having an affair, and we have the thrust of the book. Then there are the orphans, two of whom become very important in the lives of Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Its simple, straight-forward language, and its portrayal of the qualities of the Batswana (refers to the people), kept me enthralled. I was particularly struck by the fact that Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni were always referred to by this formal reference. More familiar forenames were never used. My only concern in reading this book was whether or not I was pronouncing names and places correctly-places like the Makadikadi Salt Pans, the town of Molepolole, and the names Tlokweng, Letsenyane and Sonqkwena, to name a few. If you read it, you will love it.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-24

The fifth in the Full series, Full Bloom is full of eye rolls and arched eyebrows to the extent that I began seeing mental pictures of Groucho Marx every time I read that someone either \\"gave an eye roll\\" or \\"did an eye roll\\" or \\"arched one brow\\" or \\"arched both brows.\\" All that was needed was a cigar and the Marx picture would've been complete.<br /><br />Romantic comedy novels are generally not my genre, but I'm adding more of them to my repertoire and getting used to the flavor. The list of characters in this story is long, perhaps too long, but there are the usual standouts. The main character, beautiful red-haired Annie Fortenberry; the hunky Wes Bridges; the lovable old neighbor, Doc; the soon-to-be-marrieds, Max and Jamie, whose approaching nuptials at Annie's B&B, a former bordello in its day, is one of the plotlines in the book. Add Theenie, Destiny, and Lovelle, Annie's wacky boarders at the B&B; a drunken, cranky handyman (well, he's not really so handy), Erdle; and Annie's devoted friend (and wanna be lover), Danny, and we have the basic set. Many other characters come and go and each adds his/her essence to the tale (including Fleas the dog and Peaches the cat).<br /><br />The plot surrounds events at the B&B; primarily the preparations for Max and Jamie's wedding, and everyone's interest in getting Annie hitched again after the disappearance of her wayward husband three years previous. Annie is a major klutz, so there is a great deal of what approaches slapstick comedy involved in her every move. When hubby Charles's remains are found buried in Annie's backyard, the plot thickens, and Annie finds she is in deep doodoo. Oh, yes, I almost forgot, there's also a unhappy ghost haunting the B&B (for sure?). Yes, reader, this story does include the kitchen sink, so enjoy the entertainment it provides.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-23

Again I am impressed by Sparks's ability to portray a man as manly, yet vulnerable and genuinely caring. In this effort, I found Jeremy more appealing than the object of his affection, Lexie Darnell, who was far too rigid in her desire to have Jeremy come to her (more than once) to profess his love and sincerity. But then....<br /><br />Investigative journalist, Jeremy Marsh, is in the business of using science to debunk the self-proclaimed authenticity of psychics, spirit guides, faith healers and mediums, who work to make true believers out of those who put their trust (and their hard-earned dollars) into their divinations, prophecies, insights, etc. He receives a letter from a woman in North Carolina about a cemetery in Boone Creek, which legend holds is haunted by the spirits of former slaves. Ms. Doris McClellan invites him to Boone Creek to see if he can make sense of what the lights are all about. Arriving in town, Jeremy sees, and soon meets, the lovely Lexie Darnell, who turns out to be Doris's granddaughter. (Jeremy learns upon meeting and talking with Doris that she has a special gift, which Jeremy rejects out of hand and plans to debunk as well.) Lexie, has a sad past, mistrusts men totally and, hence, is utterly unimpressed by handsome, city boy Jeremy Marsh. She is certain Jeremy is in town only to make fun of the country hicks she believes Jeremy thinks they all are. However, her insides have a very different feeling about Jeremy, and therein lies the rub.<br /><br />The book is well-written, intriguing, beguiling, and certainly hits one's 'dreams of romance' buttons. One aspect of Sparks's storytelling that I appreciate is that the reader can learn some interesting facts from his novels. For example, in this one, what about those horses? Enjoy and learn.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-23

The tale this book tells is tragic and, even though the reader knows its fiction, what happens to the small child in this book happens in real life.<br /><br />The story revolves around a series of gory murders of men who've been killed by a woman with whom each has had a one-night stand...his last! Detective Jack (Jackson) Daniels and partner, Marvin, are called upon to investigate the first case. As the investigation proceeds, Jack meets and falls for the beautiful Gillian. Divorced, but still seeing his ex-wife on occasion, Jack begins to think he could get seriously involved with the enigmatic woman who is not always at his beck and call. While Jack is making love to Gillian and trying to find a man killer, other men are dying, and the same gruesome message is left behind by the killer, a bloody handprint on the wall behind the bed with the words \\"Wayne's Dead\\" inscribed in blood. What's the meaning of the words? And what is that grotesque, bloody body part on the floor? The final outcome, though somewhat predictable, is well handled by Ms. French. You know what they say about reading a book...if the end leaves you saying, \\"Wow! That was good!\\" then the author has done her job.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill<br /><br />Also recommended: Chasing Horses, Chasing Demons, and The Bodyguard; all by Christy Tillery French	2005-05-19

This book is quick and easy to read, has humor and is thought-provoking, to say the least. Everyone we know who's read it, can see him/herself and others in each of the four characters: Sniff, Scurry, Hem and Haw. Sniff and Scurry are two little mice and Hem and Haw are two mice-sized humans. The book is about how each character handles changes that come along with the business of living. The Cheese represents what we have and want in life...home, job, family, success. The Maze is where we look for these things. When the Cheese gets moved, does one hold fast or does one go looking for new Cheese? Each character in the \\"story\\" deals with change differently. It takes only about an hour to read this book, but it will change the way you look at things forever.<br /><br />One of the aspects of this book I especially like is the Handwriting on the Wall. Every few pages we are treated to one of these messages. For example, \\"Noticing small changes early helps you adapt to the bigger changes that are to come.\\" Each message appears on its own page on a wedge of cheese. Included with the book is a separate card on which is written all of the Handwriting on the Wall messages. This card can be carried in a briefcase/purse, left on a desk, posted on a bulletin board....<br /><br />If you're looking for a good graduation gift, WMMC would be perfect for young people about to set out into the world from either high school or college (along with Dr. Seuss's, Oh, the Places You'll Go!)<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-18

It's a great book for these young adults as they begin a new life passage. It's all about going out and finding your way in life, weathering its storms, and being in charge of and taking responsibility for your life and how it turns out. It begins...<br /><br />Congratulations!<br />Today is your day.<br />You're off to Great Places!<br />You're off and away!<br /><br />Isn't that a great beginning for anyone starting anew? Remember the old saying, \\"Today is the first day of the rest of your life?\\" It certainly fits here. This book was originally published in 1990 and has more text than many of Dr. Seuss books that are aimed at very young audiences (I know a 90-year-old who still loves Dr. Seuss's books). The book is 56 pages long (unnumbered) with illustrations as bizarre and wonderful as only Theodor Seuss Geisel could draw them. I also appreciate that on the back cover of this book is the entire list of Dr. Seuss books in the order in which they were written.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-17

So many possible villains: Gordon Amory, Jack Emerson, Carter Stewart, Mark Fleischman, and those are just the obvious ones. The plot has to do with a high school reunion and its attendant honoring of some of the class's most successful graduates. There are six of them. The four men mentioned above and two women, actress Laura Wilcox and Dr. Jean Sheridan, historian and best selling author. All of the guys had rough lives as youngsters and a couple of them intensely hated Stonecroft Academy and everyone in it. However, one of them hated seven girls in particular. One of those, Alison Kendall, drowned in her pool only a short time before the reunion and everyone is abuzz about that as the weekend festivities begin.<br /><br />On another front, Cornwall Police Detective Sam Deegan is still trying to solve the twenty-year-old murder of another young woman in town, Karen Sommers, and soon finds himself up to his earlobes in more murders, similar in method to Karen's. Stonecroft Gazette reporter extraordinaire, Jake Perkins, is on the scene to record reunion events, and ends up a major player as people begin to go missing.<br /><br />Ms. Clark has woven her tale very carefully, presenting the reader with a red herring here and there, and in general making one's skin crawl as the plot unfolds. The evil one is an active character in the story in the form of his real persona and his alter ego. Clark conceals the killer's identity from the reader, until she's ready to expose him, by using his alter ego's moniker, The Owl, and having him forbid his victims to speak...even think, it appears...his real name.<br /><br />A piece of advice for high school students reading this book: Be careful how you treat your fellow classmates, particularly at the lunch table.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-15

Starting with the tenth book in a series probably isn't the place to start, but then I've always liked doing certain things backwards, like looking through magazines. Ten Big Ones is my first Evanovich book. The humor is a bit sophomoric, but I found myself LOL at some of the antics of its characters. One of my favorite characters turned out to be Sally, the transvestite. Snap. Snap.<br /><br />The story opens with the destruction of yet another of Stephanie's vehicles, which, of course, is not her fault-not much is her fault. She spends her days going after \\"skips\\" - those who don't show up for their court date after the bail bonds company she works for posts bond. Because Stephanie happened to see the face of the Red Devil during a robbery, she's in more danger than the usual stuff of catching up with skips. Therein lies the plot, such as it is.<br /><br />Between Stephanie's bounty hunting escapades; her romantic trysts and fantasies; and her quirky family and friends, she has her hands full. Grandma Mazur is a pip, while sister, Valerie, and her live-in-boyfriend-father-of-her-new-baby, Albert Kloughn (yes, it's pronounced Clown), make everyone sick with their Cuddle Umpkins, Cutie Uggums baby talk to each other. Then there's Lula, the office file clerk, and ex-ho, who is Stephanie's sidekick as she makes her rounds in the Trenton area of New Jersey. Lula's physical presence, demeanor, and antics add considerable comedy to the story. Then there's Taskykakes, doughnuts, shower gel and Chez Doodles. If you're looking for light fare this is it. Ms. E is a master craftsman at writing light comedy with a tinge of suspense.<br /><br />If you'll excuse me now, I'm going to go cuddle with my Snuggy Uggums.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-12

I see the point another reviewer made about entitling the book R is for Reba as this character is definitely the lead in this story, which at times I found disconcerting. However, I grew to like Reba, so it turned out to be OK by me. While the book is not riveting (I could easily set it down and return to it later), I found it comfortable to read in parcels and finished it in a few days (which gave me time to absorb many of its details). Whatever else is going on, it's always interesting to see what's up with landlord Henry Pitts, his brother William and wife Rosie the Hungarian, and this time with Michigan brother, Lewis, who arrives for an unscheduled visit.<br /><br />It does seem to me Grafton has increased her descriptive narrative as she proceeds through the alphabet. Perhaps this has become convenient filler. She has been roundly criticized for this practice, but if the reader absorbs the descriptions, he/she learns much about the places Detective Kinsey Millhone has been and how precisely she takes in the scene around her (makes for a good detective). I do think one can only describe bars so many times before the descriptions become grudgingly repetitious, and counting down the digital readout on an elevator door panel (twice) is carrying things a bit far, \\"...4 to 3 to 2 to 1.\\" I was also surprised at how easily Kinsey allowed Reba to manipulate her... as in the shopping spree. If she didn't want Reba in the changing room with her, I would've expected her to just say NO.<br /><br />Having said all this, I found the book an enjoyable read and continue to be impressed with Grafton's way with words. Her description of the July heat as being \\"thick as sour milk\\" and smelling like \\"feedlots\\" made me feel the unpleasantness of the day even as we experience an unusually long, snowy, cold winter in Michigan. She follows this sentence with a description of her T-shirt sticking to her back and the \\"sheen of moisture\\" on her face, \\"...the sort of clamminess that wakes you from a dead sleep when you've just come down with the flu.\\" Yuck!<br /><br />I intend to eventually read all Grafton's alphabet novels and to learn from her as an author.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillback and the \\"sheen of moisture\\" on her face, \\"...the sort of clamminess that wakes you from a dead sleep when you've just come down with the flu.\\" Yuck!  <br /> <br />I intend to eventually read all Grafton's alphabet novels and to learn from her as an author.  <br /> <br />Carolyn Rowe Hill  <br />	2005-05-08

It is told in the first person by Amir, who tells of his childhood growing up near Kabul, his adult life in America, and the act of redemption he must carry out to right a terrible wrong...perhaps more than one. The book is well written and flows nicely which makes it easy to read. The only time I set it down was when I needed a few minutes to digest what I'd just read or responsibility beckoned. Hosseini's characters are easy to like or dislike, as the case may be (I wondered as I read the book, if any of it was autobiographical).<br /><br />Hosseini includes many words and phrases in the Persian language of Farsi. Salaam, Khala Jamila, khastegari, naan, Topeh chasht are only a fraction of them (read the book to find out what they mean).  The reader learns why the color green is so important to Afghanis (notice how Hamid Karsi, Afghanistan's president, always wears green...the Afghan flag, etc.). We learn about the great, ancient tradition of kite flying and kite running, which is taken very seriously in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Afghanistan is a beautiful country when it's not being torn apart by invaders or internal battles among secular and/or religious factions. Amir sees it in all its beauty during his childhood, but returns to see it in ruins in mid-2001. The story begins in the winter of 1963 and ends in March 2002 (six months after September 11, 2001).<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-07

A farmer's furrowed field, a vast blue sky and bucolic setting complete the scene. Each page that follows presents another verse, accompanying illustration, and a text box that imparts a piece of our flag's history to the reader. The book is stunning to look at, informative and heartwarming to read. It is a good introduction to youngsters about how our flag came to be, how it's changed over the years, and its meaning to us as citizens.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-05-05

This was my first Fern Michaels book.<br /><br />The story surrounds the attempt by thirtyish Cady Jordan to regain her memory of an accident that happened twenty years earlier. She was seriously injured (now recovered), but Jeff King, a bully who took delight is terrorizing Cady, died in the same accident. The two fell from a \\"zip line\\" (precipitated by some rock-throwing) that connected a tree with the ground beyond a pond over which the zip line traveler had to pass. Four other children (Andy and Amy Hollister, Pete Danson, and Boomer Ward) were there that day, but each ran away and never admitted their presence. The story is very predictable and includes a nasty little secret that turns out to be predictable, as well (it was even easy to predict with whom Cady would end up romantically).<br /><br />Cady is eventually taken away from Indigo Valley by her parents. She returns at age thirty to supposedly aid her ailing, 82-year-old grandmother. The intrigue begins with her return. The book was entertaining enough, but at times I felt the author left out information the reader needed for continuity. She would fill the spaces a few pages later through the use of a dialog, but by then I'd been back-searching to find a proper connection, which was distracting. For comic relief, Cady's wacky, but loving grandmother is a former Hollywood movie star who shares her Indigo Valley mansion with a former stunt woman and a has-been director. The three of them manipulate and maneuver constantly in an attempt to help Cady solve her mystery and get a life.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that this story would be good for young people to read and discuss. It might help them see how damage done by a lie and the accompanying secrecy (and more lies) that surrounds it, can eventually have dire consequences. The story is actually quite appropriate for teenagers on all levels. For these reasons I've given the book four stars.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillly quite appropriate for teenagers on all levels.

This book contains two of our family's favorite stories: \\"A List\\" and \\"Cookies.\\" \\"A List\\" is the first story. One morning, while still in bed, Toad makes a list of all the things he must do that day. As you read this one, you'll recognize people you know (or have known). \\"The Garden\\" is the second story and is quite precious. Toad plants flower seeds and is impatient to see them grow. As usual, he puts himself through much in order to accomplish the inevitable. \\"The Cookies\\" is a great story for those of us who are cookie monsters. The two friends try to figure out how NOT to eat the delicious cookies Toad has just baked. Priceless. \\"Dragons and Giants\\" is next. This story is about being brave...a real challenge for these two fellows. Last, but not least, is \\"The Dream.\\" This story is about ego and has an important lesson for all of us about what's important in life.<br /><br />Again, the accompanying audio tape for Frog and Toad Together with Arnold Lobel as storyteller is a must.

Then there's Stinky, Stinky Diaper Change to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, and so on. Do you (or anyone in your family) get carsick? Then you'll love I'm So Carsick, sung to the tune of Oh, Susanna.<br /><br />Catrow's illustrations are a hoot and a half! The combination of the words and pictures is sure to tickle your funnybone. With two young boys in our family, each with one of these books and a very vivid imagination, we frequently have a new set of words to one or another of the tunes in this hilarious  book. I highly recommend it. Makes a great gift.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-21
US	25509285	R37Y2FQ0KVX0UE	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	4	8	12	N	N	Nick Drake is one determined fellow	Michael Crichton is a most talented author and in State of Fear he, again, takes some chances with science and public opinion. Like Brown's Da Vinci Code, this book has stirred up some controversy, depending on your point of view regarding environmentalism and the use of the world's resources. There's also some similarity in Crichton's mixing of fact with fiction. Reader beware!<br /><br />Nick Drake is the protagonist and he's out to fix things, even if it takes murder to get the world to see things his way. Drake's outrage and the lengths to which he's willing to go to payback his detractors is nothing short of stupefying! The novel is entertaining and frightening...isn't that the purpose of writing it? Crichton's scientific research shows, even if misused in some instances. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, some of this book's characters seem to be there only for FYI purposes and are not fleshed out. As I read the book, I was reminded of the TV program West Wing. The characters in this show, even the main ones, often appear to spend more time spouting facts and figures and making statements intentionally designed to impart knowledge to the audience, than becoming tangible, identifiable characters.<br /><br />Though State of Fear has its drawbacks, I still wanted to turn the pages to find out what came next, which makes this book a true page-turner and definitely worth the reader's time.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-21

While there are not a great many, those visual aids -- schematics, photos, maps -- that are included are extremely helpful. Some of the photographs are breathtaking.<br /><br />This book is exactly as it's cracked up to be. It is extraordinarily well conceived and superbly written. One has to admire an author who can write minute detail without it being perceived as filler. Every detail presented in The Da Vinci Code is pertinent. It is also much to the author's credit to be able to keep so much detail straight and to present it in such a way as to keep the reader interested. The plot is constructed so expertly that it all seems quite plausible (hence the controversy). Intrigue abounds. The characters are believable and well-constructed. As I often do with a book as jam-packed with information as this one, I set it down periodically to give myself time to absorb what I'm reading. It may be only a few minutes, or an hour, and, occasionally, a day. The short chapters make setting it down and picking it up again very easy to do.<br /><br />This book is a novel (again, that's fiction, folks) about the closeness of Mary Magdelene to Jesus and how the \\"true\\" knowledge of their relationship might affect Christian religion and practice as we know them today. Certainly the emergence of the power of the sacred feminine would cause problems for those who see Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism and Islam as, primarily (and in some cases totally), the realm of men. For me, the most important phrase in the whole book, considering the topic, was young Sophie's answer to her grandfather's query about the possibility that Jesus had a girlfriend. Her innocent and unbiased child's answer was, \\"I wouldn't mind.\\" Out of the mouths of babes....<br /><br />I would recommend that all those with any awareness of the spiritual and organized religion aspect of mankind read this book and then talk about it with others. If I could give it more than five stars, I would. The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating and exciting read.<br /><br />For those interested in a NOVEL about the papacy and the election of a new Pope, I recommend the book and the movie The Shoes of the Fisherman by Morris West.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hille stars, I would.

Author Arnold Lobel certainly captures the foibles, eccentricities and idiosyncrasies of human character in his portrayal these two lovable amphibians. This book has four stories. One is entitled \\"Spring\\" in which Frog uses his wits to convince Toad it's time to wake up. The second is \\"The Story\\" in which Frog ends up telling Toad a story after Toad undoes himself trying to think of a story to tell his ailing friend. The third story is \\"The Lost Button\\" in which Toad, Frog, and friends search for Toad's lost button. The fourth story is\\" The Letter\\" in which Toad is bemoaning the fact that he never gets any mail.<br /><br />This book and its companion books about Frog and Toad are on their third generation in our family. The accompanying audio tapes for these books with Arnold Lobel as the storyteller are priceless. Lobel's dry, monotonic delivery is exactly what is needed to depict the characters, the scene and the humor in these totally delightful tales.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-21

Togo is a heart-rending story about the Siberian husky some folks believe was given short shrift after the Great Serum Race of 1925. Togo, his handler, Leonhard Seppala, and his team of brave sled dogs ran a total of 260 miles, farther than any team of dogs during the dramatic race against time to get diphtheria vaccine to Nome in January, 1925.<br /><br />The book includes a map of the trail that begins in Anchorage where the serum is loaded onto a train and taken to the end of the line in Nenana. There the dogsleds take over. Seppala and his team leave Nome headed for Nulato, 300 miles from Nome, where they are to pick up the serum and take it back to Nome. They race through a raging winter storm for three days. On the fourth day, they almost miss the musher they're to meet because Seppala can't see or hear in the storm.  However, Togo's ears shoot up, and Seppala finally hears the other musher's voice. Another team ends up taking the serum the last leg to Nome, and this is where the controversy begins.<br /><br />The other musher, Gunnar Kaasen, and his dog, Balto, owned and trained by Seppala, made the final leg of the journey, also with much difficulty. A hero's welcome awaited them in Nome, and Kaasen's and Balto's names became well known around the world. Togo gave his all to get the serum to Nome, and never raced again. Balto spent his last days at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, along with his sled mates, and a statue of him was erected in New York's Central Park.<br /><br />However one views the days after the race, it was nothing short of a miracle that the dogs and mushers of the great serum race covered the same distance in five days that it took the U.S. mail system 30 days to cover, and did so in the most horrendous weather conditions imaginable.<br /><br />Mr. Blake is also the award-winning author of the children's book, Akiak, about another great Iditarod husky.

As a lover of amber and history, I was excited about The Amber Room immediately upon hearing of it. I bought it. After retrieving it from the elderly lady to whom I'd given it as a gift (She hadn't gotten around to reading it yet, thank goodness!), it took me six months to finish it. The first chapter about the events at Mauthausen Concentration Camp and Karol Borya was a great beginning. I was hooked and eager for more, but then it got slow-w-w. It wasn't until the author got back to the subject at hand, several chapters later, that my interest was rekindled. I found Christian Knoll, Suzanne Danzer and Monika Fellner to be so decadent and devoid of humanity that I could not identify with or feel any empathy for them at all. Karol Borya, Judge Rachel Cutler's father, was the character I cared about the most, and those of us who stuck with the story know what happens to him.<br /><br />I believe Steve Berry is better than this book. There should be enough genuine international intrigue surrounding the Amber Room to write an inspired,  even sexy, international thriller about a fascinating subject. However, resorting to so much gratuitous and violent sexual content demeans a good body of work.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-15

It took me a while to get into it. At first I thought I wouldn't finish it, but the next thing I knew, I couldn't put it down. Shelton LaFleur's young life is tragic. He is a black child being reared by a white mother, who is ill. The circumstances of his birth and how he became part of this woman's family is heart-rending and misguided (let alone illegal). At age eight, he wanders away from home one night, gets lost, climbs a tree for a better view, and falls. He ends up being taken to a home for orphaned boys, where he not only has to deal with his permanent injuries, but physical and psychological abuse, as well. His life becomes a torment. Eventually a family takes him in, but what a family it turns out to be.<br /><br />In spite of the painful circumstances of his childhood, and maybe because of them, LaFleur grows up to be a successful painter. Though some of his work is enigmatic and dark, he finds an audience as he matures. The story is written from the vantage point of the old man he's become.<br /><br />It's been eight months since I read this book, and I still think about it. That's a book worth reading!<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-14
US	25509285	R1AMDPD12XLV7N	0385511809	740331338	Saturday: A novel	Books	5	3	7	N	N	Thought-provoking and well-written	This story takes place in one day, a Saturday, a unique Saturday, a frightening Saturday. While Ian McEwan is British, the events of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, in America had a tremendous effect on him. For a time, he says, he couldn't write. I know the feeling. I was writing at the time and stopped for one-and-a-half years because my story included a terrorist element. I simply couldn't continue for awhile. This book is a product of McEwan's own introspection regarding the events of 9/11.<br /><br />Henry Perowne, the central character in Saturday, is a neurosurgeon and a family man. His wife is a lawyer. He has two healthy and very capable children. In the middle of the night he awakes to see what he thinks is a meteor streaking toward Earth. The meteor turns out to be an airplane, engulfed in flame, about to crash not far off. The event shakes him to his core and he spends the rest of the day thinking about this horrific incident, about the possibilities as to its cause, and, eventually, about his own life, his very existence. He shares with his readers the intimate details of his world as he tries to make sense of the terror he feels as the day progresses.<br /><br />Perowne's obsession with work seems less necessary as he reviews his life and the things he's deemed to be important. His interactions with people, especially those he loves the most, are not all he would like them to be. He looks inward, seeking and discovering his own spirituality, rejected long ago. He finds comfort there, if not understanding.<br /><br />The events of the day become more horrific as time goes on and Perowne has to come to terms with his own demons in order to deal with the situation his family faces. Parts of this book remind me of The Shoes of the Fisherman by Morris West because there is so much personal introspection and less plot-driven text. It's a very thought-provoking read. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-14

He enjoyed the story and we have all enjoyed the candy recipe and the candy basket that can be made by tracing the one in the book, coloring it and then folding the finished piece into a box.<br /><br />It seems the Chocolate Train, while on his delivery rounds, becomes lonesome for his Chocolate Town. When he goes there, it has melted from the summer heat. This is a story of friendship and helping others. The illustrations are well done and so delicious-looking they make you want to eat the page. It's definitely a charmer for young and mature alike. Good birthday party gift for youngsters.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-12

Set in mid-19th century England, it surrounds the homecoming of the Dreghorn clan for the Christmas holidays and how they deal with the news of the death of Judah Dreghorn, which has been ruled an accident. As the Dreghorns pursue the events of the night of Judah's death, murder seems more likely than a fatal mishap. Issues of the past come to the fore and questions of honor in an honor-bound time take center stage. Family friend, Henry Rathbone, comes to spend the holiday and is instrumental in helping to seek out the answers to the prickly questions that arise about forgery, an error in judgement that sent a man to prison for eleven years, and murder. The story seems to me a wonderful parable, a lesson to be learned; a chance to make things right when making them right may deprive you of all you've come to love in the way of material wealth and property.<br /><br />The book is easy to read. I read it, with minor interruptions, in about three hours. I am not well acquainted with Ms. Perry's work, though I certainly intend to become more so. This book would be a good one for families to read together and to then discuss the ramifications of its messages.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-10

As I read it, I thought about one of my daughters-in-law and her growing daughters, who are all avid readers. They also spend time in the kitchen mixing things up together. This book, and series, would be perfect for them. The story takes up 168 pages of this 341-page book with the remainder in recipes from appetizers to desserts and beverages (I notice some of the other reviewers are quite critical of this format, but, in this instance, I enjoyed it and have picked out some recipes to try).<br /><br />Hannah Swenson is the protagonist (my own protagonist is named Hannah, so the author and I had that in common from the start). Hannah is the owner of The Cookie Jar bakery shop where she makes and sells sweet treats, and enjoys the company of family and friends in the small community of Lake Eden, Minnesota. This year at the Lake Eden Christmas Party held at the local senior/community center, friends and family gather for the tasting party that will culminate in Hannah's latest cookbook, the Lake Eden Holiday Buffet Cookbook. However, not everyone at the event is a happy camper. That fact, combined with the disappearance of an elegant and valuable antique cake knife, a murder, and a blizzard create an evening everyone in attendance will remember for a long time to come. Hannah, once again, is instrumental in solving the crime...if, indeed, there is one.<br /><br />What fun this series is for those who love the kitchen and everything about it; developing and sharing recipes, appraising utensils, creating smashing food presentations, and indulging in some good old town gossip. While the plot was a bit predictable, it was entertaining. Thanks, Joanne, for a delightful, easy read.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-09

(Have you noticed how each book gets longer? This one is 226 pages longer than Book #2, The Chamber of Secrets.)<br /><br />In this book, Harry becomes a teenager. He spends his thirteenth birthday, as usual, with his miserable relatives, The Dursleys. However, after feeling sorry for himself all day, he gets a phone call from Ron...that's a trip, and letters from Hermoine and Hagrid. He's feeling better now. However, a visit by Aunt Marge, Uncle Vernon's sister, the next day is a disaster. You'll have to read Chapter Two to appreciate what happens to Aunt Marge.<br /><br />We move on to Hogwarts School where there is real danger for Harry this year. It seems a vicious criminal, Sirius Black, has escaped Azkaban Prison, a most dreadful place for only the most vicious of criminals, kept in line by the terrifying Dementors who suck the breath from their victims. It seems Black is looking for Harry. Everyone is terrified, and Harry and friends are faced with many harrowing moments. Near the end of the book, Harry has a close encounter with a Dementor and commits an act that will cause him considerable grief later. (Exactly what is a Dementor? A brief description from p. 384: \\"Where there should have been eyes, there was only thin, gray scabbed skin, stretched blankly over empty sockets. But there was a mouth...a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the sound of a death rattle.\\")<br /><br />This book has some truly terrifying passages that are extremely well crafted. I was genuinely scared in parts and wondered how Harry and his friends were going to make it this time. The Prisoner of Azkaban takes Harry Potter and author Rowling to a whole new level. Don't read this one when you're alone.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-07

He is fourteen and thinking more about girls. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Voldemort) is becoming stronger once again and the number of Harry's enemies is increasing, or so it seems. Just who are his true friends, and who are not? Evil is everywhere. The war between good and evil grows more intense and dangerous. Meanwhile, Hermoine is determined to free the house-elves and establishes the House Elf Liberation Front. Dobby, the house-elf, tries to adjust, but is confused; and what is Dobby's friend, Winky, the wicked Malfoys' ex-house-elf up to? <br /> <br />In the first chapter, we visit Riddle House where something strange and horrible happened 50 years before. To the villagers of Little Hangleton, it remains a creepy place. Nobody knows anymore what is true and what isn't, but they all agree that the events of that horrible day so long ago started at daybreak. We learn about Portkeys and the Dark Mark, and attend a Triwizard Tournament where some spectacular and frightening events take place. Padfoot and Wormtail are up to no good. The Death Eaters terrify everyone. Rita Skeeter is out to discredit Albus Dumbledore and ruin Rubeus Hagrid. The Irish National Quidditch Team and the Bulgarian National Quidditch Team face each other at the Quidditch World Cup where Harry is so distracted by the beautiful Veela dancers that he loses his concentration...and so it goes.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book by J. K. Rowling. It is a story about young Harry Potter, a name now known around the world. Rowling is much admired for her writing technique, her ability to weave an intriguing story, and her ability to keep her readers on the edges of their seats. I read this book in 2000 because my grandchildren were reading it and loving it! I was hooked; and, let's not forget Mary Grandpr&eacute; whose illustrations add liveliness to the text.<br /><br />When infant Harry Potter's parents are tragically murdered, he has the misfortune to be taken to live with his mother's sister, husband, and their son. He is delivered to Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Cousin Dudley, the Muggle family (non-magical people), on Privet Drive, London. They are a miserable lot, and so Harry spends the next 10 years living in an unloving household, unloving toward him. While his aunt and uncle treat him badly, they dote on their obnoxious brat, young Dudley. Then, at age 11, Harry receives a letter telling him to prepare to enter wizard school at Hogwarts. After a few fits and starts getting there, Harry is off on a fantastical adventure with new (and first) friends, Hermoine Granger and Ron Weasley. He begins to find out who he really is. People he's never seen before know who he is as soon as they hear his name. Heads turn and whispers abound.<br /><br />This book takes us through Harry's first year at the Hogwarts School. We meet many characters along the way, including headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, huge and lovable Rebeus Hagrid, bad boy Draco Malfoy and his sidekicks Crabbe and Goyle. We meet menacing Professor Snape, changling Professor McGonagall and strange Professor Quirrell, among others. We learn about Quidditch, a most remarkable, challenging and dangerous sport, one in which only those possessed of magical skills could ever engage. This book is a delightful beginning to what is now a world favorite, akin to the Hardy boys series of another era.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillrite, akin to the Hardy boys series of another era.

It is eagerly, almost desperately, anticipated. I own and have read, Books 1-5, and am remembering each. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second book in Rowling's extraordinary series about a remarkable young boy; a lad who starts out life happily, then his wizard parents are tragically murdered, and his life is forever changed.<br /><br />One of the challenges facing this author, and others who write series in which characters are brought forward, is the necessity to keep track of each character's personality traits, habits and experiences over time. If an author comments on one page that so-and-so dislikes coffee, and later has so-and-so savoring his or her favorite cup of java, well, we have a problem. Rowling has prepared well with outlines, drawings, and briefs about people, places and things portrayed in her work. Still, the task is enormous. Throughout seven books (that is the total number, she says), she must keep every detail constant, unless of course so-and-so decides he or she likes coffee, after all!!<br /><br />In the Chamber of Secrets, Harry must spend another summer on Privet Drive. He eagerly awaits his return to Hogwarts and his friends. Transportation back to school is a flying car, driven by friend Ron, who shows up at his upstairs bedroom window (an upgrade from the space behind the stairs where Harry spent his first 10 years on Privet drive). The adventure starts here. First, they stop off at Ron's home where we learn more about the Weasleys, and formerly meet Ginny Weasley, the boys' sister (she was at the train station in Sorcerer's Stone). The trip to school is treacherous with Ron at the wheel and a car with a mind of its own.<br /><br />This book takes us through Harry's second year at the Hogwarts School and more dangerous adventures. His curiosity and innate sense of right and wrong carry him through, though barely, in some cases. We meet several new characters, including vain Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, pesky Colin Creevey, and creepy Moanin' Myrtle; and there's more Quidditch. There's trouble about Mudbloods who are half wizard and half Muggle. Hermoine Granger is a Mudblood.<br /><br />What makes Harry so likable is that he's not perfect, far from it. He gets angry, is not a good student, occasionally disobeys the rules (for a just reason, of course), and gets into all sorts of jams. However, whatever roadblock appears before him, whatever mistakes he makes, he carries on without whining (well, maybe a little), blaming others or giving up, a good lesson for all of us. However, the dangers he faces in the Chamber of Secrets may be insurmountable.

This book, very loosely based on the person of John XXIII, made into a movie in 1968 with Anthony Quinn, is about the election of a new pope after the current one dies (circa 1963, the year Pope John died). What is remarkable about the story is that a Russian, who had been imprisoned in Siberia by communists for twenty years, becomes the new Pope. It is almost prophetic regarding the election of Pope John Paul II, a Pole with a history of fighting communism in his homeland. John Paul II wasn't elected until 15 years after the book was published, and 10 years after the movie was made.<br /><br />There is much in the movie about the election with real footage of the people of Rome and the world on the scene in St Peter's square; the black/white smoke and the meaning of each;  views inside the Vatican and the requisite conclave whereby the sequestered Cardinals elect a new Pontiff; and much more. It's a quick study in what is happening right now.<br /><br />As a non-Catholic, but an admirer of the Pope and his stature in the world, I find the movie very enlightening and learn more from it each time I watch it. I also find what I learn from it to be very helpful in understanding other works written about Pope John Paul II and by him, including this one.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-04

The movie is vastly different than the book. It would have to be. Much of the book is introspective, reflecting the thought processes of Pope Kiril I after he is elected and is a much drier read than the movie is a view, naturally. While I found the book informative and interesting, because of my interest in the Papacy, it is not an easy read. It took focused concentration to absorb all it had to offer.<br /><br />In the year this book was originally published, 1963, the real world was full of fear, anger, and starvation (some things never change). The cold war was almost 20 years old, and the West's fear of its consequences unabated. Fear of a nuclear holocaust was rampant; we were getting closer to a ground war in Vietnam. President Kennedy was assassinated in November of that year. Things weren't destined to get much better. The year the movie came out, 1968, we lost Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy to assassins. The real Pope in the real world had his hands full.<br /><br />The Shoes of the Fisherman is the story of the election of a Russian to the Papacy, one Kiril Lakota, who had been imprisoned in Siberia for 17 years (20 in the movie) and tormented by his jailer, Kamenev, who later becomes the head of the Soviet state. Lakota's ascent to the Papacy, and his actions as Pontiff, are related in this story. We learn about some of the Pope's brethren, Cardinal Leone and Cardinal Rinaldi, for example, who impart their own histories and personality traits to one another and, hence, to the reader. The George Faber of the book is very different than the one portrayed on film. One desperate world situation is dealt with in the film. In the book, there are many. Pope Kiril I is reminiscent of Pope John Paul II as the first to see the importance of traveling widely outside The Vatican; to visit his people spread across the earth.<br /><br />One character worthy of mention is theologian Jean T&eacute;l&eacute;mond. In his intense internal struggle to justify God to man, he writes. His writings, often in conflict with his elders, offer his own passionate views of God, Jesus, and the Church--its leaders, tenets, practices, and views, as they relate to the people of the world, and to science. He spent 20 years in exile because of his views, only to have same put on trial after \\"coming home.\\"<br /><br />The movie takes many liberties, simplifies and leaves out much, but doing so makes the whole of the book's message easier to digest. Like they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. The movie is a thousand pictures, pictures that help the reader understand the content and context of this excellent and thought-provoking novel.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hilltense internal struggle to justify God to man, he writes.

Miller with illustrations by Jon Van Zyle, the official artist of the dogsled race and a two-time participant in the Iditarod, is a children's book, ages 7 to 10, published in 2002 by Walker & Company. This has become one of my favorite books for introducing children to this amazing race of skill and endurance.<br /><br />The book is based on the real events of January, 1925, when the population of Nome, Alaska, was in desperate need of diphtheria vaccine. Dr. Welch had not seen a case of diphtheria in twenty years and suddenly he had three young children very ill with the disease. Something had to be done. The community was put under quarantine and an emergency wire went out to the governor in Juneau that the town needed emergency help. This is where the mushers came in. The decision was made to bring serum from Anchorage, over 1,000 miles away, to Nome. In those days, airplanes only flew in Alaska in the summertime because they had open-cockpits and neither plane nor pilot would survive the weather. A steam engine (#66) took the serum from Anchorage to Nenana where the real adventure began. The rest of the story tells of the harrowing experiences of mushers and dogs in their race against time in getting the serum to its destination. At one point, it is believed the serum might be lost.<br /><br />The front of the book includes a map of the dogsled trail from Nenana to Nome. There is also an introduction to Togo, a Siberian husky and one of the true heroes of the 1925 race. Another excellent feature included in this book, is the complete list of mushers who participated in the original race, each one's race segment, and the distance covered. The race's heroic dogs also have a page devoted to them at the end of the book. This book is a real treasure for both adults and children.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-02

This book is a Stepping Stones chapter book with black and white illustrations throughout.<br /><br />At the beginning of the book is a map of Alaska showing the Iditarod railroad and dogsled trail, along with some illustrations depicting the basic story of this great race against time to get much-needed diphtheria serum to Nome in 1925.<br /><br />Balto is a Siberian husky born to run, and to lead. He guided his musher, Gunnar Kaasen, into Nome on the final leg of the journey, when only this magnificent dog could sense the way through a terrible, deadly blizzard with no trail to follow and wind at such strength it tossed Kaasen and dogsled into the air, almost losing their precious cargo. A short time before this near disaster, Balto saved the team from going through the ice to certain death. His instincts were in the realm of the supernatural and his devotion to the task at hand human in awareness.<br /><br />It states on the back cover that this book is for children in grades 1-3. As the Cleveland Museum of Natural History states on the same back cover, \\"Balto's story is one of courage, cooperation and inspiration, and personal sacrifice for the greater good.\\"<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-04-01

In attendance were fourteen of her sorority sisters from her college days. What a special night it was for them. The overall turnout was excellent, and the audience appreciated Ms. Guest's comments, her discussion of the real stories behind this novel, her revelation of some of her own life issues, and her thought processes behind certain fictional characters in this book, particularly that of the depressive Sheriff Hugh DeWitt. DeWitt has a difficult time seeing the positive side of anything. That does not change during the course of the story.<br /><br />Ms. Guest's writing is easygoing and fluid. The book is made up of short, fast-moving chapters. The concept is a little different than the usual mystery novel as Guest includes chapters about the Norbois victims at the time they were alive. Each member of the family has his/her own chapter.<br /><br />Being from Petoskey, Michigan, and very much aware of the Robison murders (Norbois) and a student at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the time of John Norman Collins, I was interested in reading this book from the instant I first heard about it (one of Collins's victims was murdered two blocks from where we lived on campus). When you've been there, a story based on real events looks very different to you than to someone who knows nothing about these events. The Robison murders have never been solved. John Norman Collins remains in prison.<br /><br />Judith Guest shared with us some of the fears she had about writing this story while the possibility exists that the Robison killer is still out there somewhere (even though she believes there's a connection between the Norbois murders and JNC). She also talked about some of the people still very interested in solving this horrendous crime. Hopefully, this fictionalized version of the real story will lead to that end. A good read.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-03-19

(I actually saw the Made for TV version first and then read the book.) Albom has a way of telling a story very well in relatively few words. Perhaps this comes from his years of writing sports articles for the printed news media.<br /><br />The story of Eddie's life and the people whose lives he touched, and who profoundly touched his, was interesting enough, but it is the end of the story that makes this story great. It is not until then that the genius of this work becomes evident. It is then that the reader reflects on all that came before and gains a true appreciation of the story Albom tells. May we all learn from it.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-03-19

I see the point another reviewer made about entitling the book R is for Reba as this character is definitely the lead in this story, which at times I found disconcerting. However, I grew to like Reba, so it turned out to be OK by me. While the book is not riveting (I could easily set it down and return to it later), I found it comfortable to read in parcels and finished it in a few days (which gave me time to absorb many of its details). Whatever else is going on, it's always interesting to see what's up with landlord Henry Pitts, his brother William and wife Rosie the Hungarian, and this time with Michigan brother, Lewis, who arrives for an unscheduled visit.<br /><br />It does seem to me Grafton has increased her descriptive narrative as she proceeds through the alphabet. Perhaps this has become convenient filler. She has been roundly criticized for this practice, but if the reader absorbs the descriptions, he/she learns much about the places Detective Kinsey Millhone has been and how precisely she takes in the scene around her (makes for a good detective). I do think one can only describe bars so many times before the descriptions become grudgingly repetitious, and counting down the digital readout on an elevator door panel (twice) is carrying things a bit far, \\"...4 to 3 to 2 to 1.\\" I was also surprised at how easily Kinsey allowed Reba to manipulate her... as in the shopping spree. If she didn't want Reba in the changing room with her, I would've expected her to just say NO.<br /><br />Having said all this, I found the book an enjoyable read and continue to be impressed with Grafton's way with words. Her description of the July heat as being \\"thick as sour milk\\" and smelling like \\"feedlots\\" made me feel the unpleasantness of the day even as we experience an unusually long, snowy, cold winter in Michigan. She follows this sentence with a description of her T-shirt sticking to her back and the \\"sheen of moisture\\" on her face, \\"...the sort of clamminess that wakes you from a dead sleep when you've just come down with the flu.\\"  Yuck!<br /><br />I intend to eventually read all Grafton's alphabet novels and to learn from her as an author.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hillf moisture\\" on her face, \\"...the sort of clamminess that wakes you from a dead sleep when you've just come down with the flu.\\"  Yuck!

Ambrose - a tribute	For a number of years I watched Stephen Ambrose in History Channel or PBS documentaries, or as a guest, discussing a variety of historical characters and events. I found him easy to listen to and very well informed. This is the first of his books I've read and I'm very impressed with how easy it is to read and understand. I also appreciate Ambrose stating that he changed his mind about how he saw certain individuals and events as time passed and he watched, studied, and observed. To America is a love letter written to all of us by Mr. Ambrose as he lived out his last days with cancer in the fall of 2002.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about many of the remarkable (and often flawed) men who helped form our nation: Thomas Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, George Custer and Crazy Horse, Dwight Eisenhower, and even Richard Nixon, to name a few.<br /><br />Among Mr. Ambrose's other books are Band of Brothers (seen regularly on the History Channel), about Easy Company in WWII; Undaunted Courage, about the opening of the American West; and Pegagsus Bridge, about one \\"small\\" battle on D-Day, June 6, 1944.<br /><br />If you like history, you'll thoroughly enjoy this book.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-03-17
