The message that I took from this book is that some marketing does suck, but that it doesn't have to be that way. Seriously, to some people this book would be seen as pure enlightenment. To others it's old-hat regurgitated tripe. Is the divide really generational? Who knows, but I got you to read my review ;-)<br /><br />The book never promises to be a guide full hundreds of tips and techniques, so I'm not going to fault it for not providing any.<br /><br />It does promise to give an entertaining outlook of common \\"bad marketing\\" and how to better approach some things. I found the writing to be enjoyable and even humorous in places.<br /><br />Risking flames by giving a 5-star rating, but it's nothing less (and a bit more) than promised, so I give it:<br /><br />Applicability: 7 - seems to depend on some demographic shift between the \\"old\\" and \\"new\\" marketing techniques that I can't peg. but it was applicable to me.<br /><br />Creativity: 9 - the title alone is worth a score of 9<br /><br />Readability: 9 - short and entertaining<br /><br />Worst Point: as another reader pointed out, stevens is often self congratulatory<br /><br />Best point: Stevens gets the brass balls award for his scathing assault on a common marketing practice of \\"draining the annual budget\\".	2005-06-01

The philosophy and reasoning behind The Origin of Brands is both interesting and valuable. The book describes (in depth) an analogy between Darwinian survival of species and the survival of brands. The logic is sound, and when correctly applied to a marketing plan or branding initiative, will no doubt prove to be worthy.<br /><br />However, I felt at times that the analogy was too forced. Too much of the book was devoted to proving (with example after example after example) that the authors' theories of divergence was sound. They had me convinced early on, and I looked forward to more \\"now what?\\" discussions of how to go about applying this theory to the real world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, much of that was left to the reader to deduce based upon the very many examples given. There is a lot of valuable information to be had though, so I only docked them one star.<br /><br />Regardless of my stingy rating, the book is a must read for serious marketing professionals.<br /><br />Applicability: 8 out of 10 -- could use more discussion of practical application<br /><br />Creativity: 10 - darwinian analogy is easy to understand and provoking<br /><br />Readability: 9 - easy writing style to absorb and fun to read, but gets bogged down at times in self ratification<br /><br />Value: 9 - for the money spent on this book, you could avoid some very common and critical marketing blunders.<br /><br />Best Point: Darwinian theories and quotes from the original Origin of Species - lets exercise those brains folks! Complete with illustrations, this analogy really does hold the book together and makes the title apt and appropriate.<br /><br />Worst Point: In a lengthy diatribe against convergence, the Rieses seem to forget that some forms of divergence come when a species (or brand) strengthen a common trait (feature) that is shared with another species (brand). That is, not all \\"convergence\\" is bad -- such as telecom \\"service convergence\\" of voice video and data, which has led to diverging technologies (higher-speed broadband technologies that can support video, for example).<br /><br />Overall: 9 out of 10 (5 stars).ata, which has led to diverging technologies (higher-speed broadband technologies that can support video, for example).  <br /> <br />Overall: 9 out of 10 (5 stars).	2005-06-01

Even the title \\"Eye in the Sky\\" holds different meanings depending upon how you look at it. In this story where religion and reality mutate from one person's mind to the next, we are confronted with the question of what is real. Is the world around us just in our minds? or is it in someone else's mind? A God-fearing zealot? A paranoiac?<br /><br />And, of course, religion comes into it, as the question of God vs. Ego rises all the way to the top. All the way to the title, in fact. \\"Eye in the Sky\\", as a title, is visualized in the book when two characters ascend (Marry Poppins-like, on an umbrella) to heaven to find themselves floating before a giant eye. That alone, to me, opens up a barrel full of questions about how our desire to look into the sky and find God shapes what we see. But then, being Philip K. Dick, the twist goes further, and we then discover that the eye is not in the protagonists' mind, but in someone else's...<br /><br />There isn't enough room to ask (or attempt to answer) all the questions that book will raise, which is why it is an absolute marvel of fiction.<br /><br />One thing that I like about Dick in general is that his books are shorter than most that fall into the genre of science fiction. They are easy to read, are finished quickly, but they raise questions that will leave you thinking long after you've put the book down.<br /><br />In \\"Eye in the Sky\\" my original criticism was that the end came a bit abruptly and was non-conclusive. But then I figured it out, and now I cant stop thinking about how clever and appropriate the conclusion of the story really is.	2005-05-18

My wife would respond with \\"then why are you reading it?\\" and the honest truth is that the characters were so interesting and compelling I couldn't stop reading, even though the surreal nature of the plot didn't entirely agree with me.<br /><br />So I wont go into a comparison between this and other Murakami stories because other reviewers have done that already, but focus on the characters, whom I enjoyed tremendously.<br /><br />Creating a character means crafting a personality, and applying motivations to that personality. Motives lead to actions, which lead to changes, which lead to more motives, which lead to m ore actions, ad nauseam. That's writing 101. In \\"Kafka on the Shore\\", however, the characters (in some cases) entirely lack any personal motives. Rather, they are a part of some self-fulfilling prophecy. They are tied strongly to a predetermined destiny, and their actions and growth as characters stem from their investigation of that destiny.<br /><br />As things begin to come together, we see the characters grow into something beyond mere personalities, and into something larger. They become the actual events and the whole story eventually swirls together into something that makes sense.<br /><br />That's my interpretation of it anyway -- like I said, it was surreal. I'll let the experts analyze this one.<br /><br />Plot: the story moves fluidly between defined goals, and is therefore easy to read, although the surreal nature of the story makes it hard to follow what's really going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />Characters: See above. They're great. A woman who is also a little girl who is tied to the fate of a boy who is also her dead lover, and another boy who is also a girl, a benevolent truck driver and a mentally challenged elderly man who can speak with cats. And of course they all end up being something more than that. Add Johnny Walker and Col. Sanders and you have an all star cast.<br /><br />Pace: The pace moved quickly, and while I often felt I was missing part of the big picture, I never felt bogged down. In fact, it was very difficult to put this book down.<br /><br />Awkward Moment: There is a very disturbing scene around the introduction of Johnny Walker that almost made me put the book down, because it made me think it was going to take an uncomfortably dark turn. The moment passes though, so if your like me, have some faith and get past it and you'll enjoy the book in the end.<br /><br />Prize Moment: Raining Leeches.<br /><br />Loose Thread: The beginning of the book seems to be more grounded in actual events, and these events (and their relation to what is going on with the rest of the characters) fade as the story progresses. The pieces fit, but you have to find them yourself. This could be a translation issue.nny Walker and Col.

If I were to judge this solely on its literary merit, it would be a two or three star review, but I understand that the goal of this story -- written by and starring a excessively smart cat -- is to provide a frivolous escape. Some might call it \\"Brain Candy\\". Anyway, I understand the need for some good ol' brain candy, so I gave it 4 stars despite what I consider to be poor writing.<br /><br />The mystery is creative, and the characters are colorful and fun. There was a definite sense of danger that built towards the end of the story. In fact, the story became more gripping as it neared the end. Once the mystery is solved, the book wastes no time in wrapping up the tale, and ends an abrupt handful of pages later.<br /><br />Like I said: fun, easy to read, but not something to write to your old English professors about.<br /><br />One thing I should mention: I am a pet lover, and as such I think that the concept of a cat and dog who follow their owner around off leash in public is cute, if not more than a bit far-fetched. Those who are not animal lovers should probably stick to regular human-oriented mysteries, as this will probably sicken you with furry sweetness.<br /><br />One other thing that I feel I should mention is that there was a surprising of profanity and some rather gruesome deaths... I don't know why but I thought this was going to be more \\"G-Rated\\". However, it is definitely targeted at an adult sense of humor. There wasn't anything terribly over-the-top, but it took me off guard. In fact, its one of the reasons I upped my review to 4 stars, because I like some occasional profanity, but it might not be for everyone.	2005-03-14

I was looking for a book that explained the basics of grappling in a way that would be helpful to an (otherwise) advanced martial artist.<br /><br />This book fits that bill... it explains how and why to perform many techniques that are, undoubtedly, basic to anyone who studies Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or Chin Na or any ground fighting style. While I can't comment on how helpful it would be to a beginner in any of those styles, it is a very useful aid to someone like myself, who already knows how to fight on their feet and is looking to adapt their skills to the ground.<br /><br />Chin Na in Ground Fighting is helpful because it goes beyond a simple collection of techniques (which are always hard to learn from books anyway), and explains the simple mechanics behind common locks and holds. Since reading this book, I find myself finally being able to visualize various submission holds in advance, and am doing better on the ground now. Again - probably not that impressive to a student of a ground fighting style, but to student of a mostly stand-up-and-strike style, it is extremely valuable.<br /><br />The illustrations are as easy to follow as any (which is to say, not easy at all unless you read carefully).<br /><br />The focus is on learning the basics from many angles, from pressure points and anatomy to joint movements and mechanics of motion and resistance.<br /><br />Overall, I've found myself referencing quite a bit over the past weeks during my training, and it has helped quite a bit.	2005-03-12

As is probably true of most wives, mine loves to be pampered. She's athletic, and often needs some muscle attention, but I am also athletic. The real problem is that my sport of choice is karate, and I am often a) exhausted, b) bruised, or c) broken and very rarely in the mood to hunker down to give a lengthy massage.<br /><br />That's where this book comes in. It is full of simple 5- or 6- step routines that leave my wife feeling relaxed and happy. I'm serious when I say that only 15 minutes of massage is good enough to put my lovely insomniac to sleep.<br /><br />The vote of a selfishly motivated husband is: two thumbs up!<br /><br />[EDIT: My wife gives it two thumbs up, too]	2005-03-12

I am now at a point between the two extremes that Bradbury dissects in this timeless (pun) merry-go-round (pun) of an a-fair (pun). OK, three puns in a row deserves a bad rating for this review, but what else can I do? The book is a classic, and will live as long as men and women look forward or backwards through their lives and reflect on what could be.<br /><br />I could chirp about how Bradbury has such eloquence and how he can construct a phrase with more spirit and humanity than should be possible, but if you want all that just read the jacket cover - greater readers and writers than I have said it all before.<br /><br />All I can do is verify that the story still holds true, and still stirs both boyish and manly emotions, even as I begin to see the shape of middle age forming in the mist of my future.	2005-03-12

I bring up the flaws in Book One because they are completely resolved in Book Two. Every lengthy passage that you may have questioned in Book One pays off in Book Two, as it reveals something about a character or an event that would have fallen flat otherwise.<br /><br />For those who've read The Risen Empire and only semi-liked it, I think you will be please with the entire story once you read the second half.<br /><br />For those who haven't, if you like hard and biting tech/military sci-fi but also love political wit and (I must admit) a rather touching love story... then buy both books at once and enjoy them both.<br /><br />On a literary note, Westerfeld crafts an intelligent and often poetic tale. He succesfully uses a few tricks of narrative that often fail (such as jumping around in the timeline, often by huge spans). The book ends with a final chapter that nicely brings the entire story to a close. His characters are believable, likeable, and remain the focus of the story even in the midst of the most enthralling space battle I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Oh... I didn't mention the battle? It begins on the first page and doesn't fully resolve until almost two thirds of the way through the book. Sci-Fi fans might want to pick this book up just for the satisfaction of that battle. It's hot.	2005-03-12

Well, let me put a disclaimer on that: the plot was very compelling, but the language was cumbersome at times. Westerfeld has a great grasp of language and has a very detail-oriented and descriptive style. Westerfeld also has managed to create some very interesting technologies, weapons, ships, etc. and provides us with a vivid image of how each works and how each fits into the fictional politics and economy.<br /><br />The problem occurs when the two collide: sophisticated explanations of technology sometimes get lost in flowery language, making some passages (lasting as long as a few ages) difficult to get through. I found that the pace was broken in this way about two or three times throughout the novel.<br /><br />But that's a small criticism for a book as enjoyable as this. For those that like to dig into sci-fi technology, this book is a gem. It also has solid military sci-fi elements and good action. For those who like character stories, there is a wonderful (but very bizarre) relationship that occurs near the end... good stuff.	2004-11-19

This kept things interesting, and the mechanism worked well due to small interspersed chapters from the &quot;Bad Grrl's Guide to Physics&quot;, which explained the concepts to those who weren't already familiar with them (which, in all fairness, most people probably were).<br />A few things bothered me, though. First, the re-use of names, book titles, characters and concepts was very distracting for the first half of the book. As the end drew near, these circular references actually helped the story along, but at the beginning they were simply irritating. I almost put the book down around page 100. However, I stuck to it, and am glad that I did. Overall the book is an easy read and it's worth it.<br />A last nit-picky criticism would be that Murphy sometimes gets lazy with descriptions, using the same words several times within a few paragraphs, and never really stretching to create any empathy through images. Still, while descriptions  are weak, the characters themselves, and their actions, are realistic and colorful.<br />This book was just a few potentialities away from being a five-star book. It was enjoyable enough to make me grab a copy of Murphy's &quot;There and Back Again&quot;.	2004-07-01

Dick novel, and in my opinion \\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\\" deserves high praise. For starters, it wins the fight against one of the most difficult opponents that a sci-fi novel could face: Clich&eacute;. Simply put, this story is based on an overused plot-the man who loses his identity and struggles to regain a sense of self. Cliche is a tough monster to beat, and most sci-fi novels are devoured by it boots and all. Going into this novel (which I read on a recommendation from a friend) I had low expectations, because I for one am sick to death of this particular premise. However, Phillip Dick somehow managed to actually win the battle against this tired fiction formula, and won me over in the process. He actually found, somehow, a unique way of telling the story. A very unique way.<br />It deserves kudos for this alone. Not the snack, but the regard and esteem.<br />Apart from being pleasantly surprised at Dick's ability to pull this story off, there is a lot more that deserves commendation, too... there's a like-him-hate-him anti hero, a wonderfully fleshed-out policeman (two, actually), and a manically bizarre \\"mini-heroine\\" that pops up to simultaneously help, hurt and hinder the protagonist, Jason Taverner.<br />Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed was Dick's writing style. The story is written upon a fine line between poetry and prose that often lulled me into a false sense of security. He managed on several occasions to make me say \\"wow\\" due to some particularly inspiring turn of phrase, or through some witty and poignant philosophical observation... in fact, some of his descriptions, in their poetic simplicity, created such vivid images in my mind that I am inclined to compare them to Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451, which contains one of my favorite pieces of descriptive text of all time.<br />All-in-all, \\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\\" is an easy read with very realistic characters, a healthy dose of political and philosophical impact (which is what sci-fi is all about after all), a delightful plot-twist at the ending (I loved the ending), and an overall quality and completeness that many novels lack. The ending (did I mention that I loved the ending) was ripe with potentialities as well, an amalgam of hidden possibilities and quantum probabilities. Basically, the premise of the book (that a man is sucked into some alternate reality where he does not exist) is caused by something that does not fully cease to occur until somewhere in the epilogue (That will make more sense after you read the book. Pay attention at the end, and wonder just what is real and what isn't. It's fun).philosophical impact (which is what sci-fi is all about after all), a delightful plot-twist at the ending (I loved the ending), and an overall quality and completeness that many novels lack.

Still, thinking back to my college days when I did a lot of work in film, I did feel like crying on occasion. I think it was sympathy pains. Bruce Campbell, despite his mighty chin (which is so big and sharp you could probably use it to open a can of beans), had a rough start. Reading about how he and friend Sam Raimi managed somehow to complete \\"Evil Dead\\" was empowering to me (I mean, if that actually worked for them, maybe I have hope after all).<br /><br />This book is not a literary masterpiece, nor is it a study in grammarian excellence. This book is a raw and honest portrayal of Hollywood's \\"B\\" side. It is magnificent because Bruce Campbell still thinks like a B actor, even though he's a fairly mainstream cult attraction at this point (with a cameo in Spiderman!). The perspective offered in this fun (and easy) read is refreshing and interesting. It really does give a glimpse into the life of an actor in \\"blue collar hollywood\\".<br /><br />[Edit: This is a bit off-topic, and also somewhat shameless, but if/when my new book [[ASIN:1419682644 Cluck: Murder Most Fowl]] becomes a cult-hit b-movie, I want Bruce Campbell as the lead. -edk]	2004-05-24

The title is perfect: this is a book about a quest to find a sheep: both literally, figuratively and spiritually.<br />The plot can be confusing (and even somewhat boring in the first part of the book), but it pulls together nicely at the end. The real enjoyment, however, comes from the descriptive qualities of Haruki Murakami's writing. He is able to capture an immense quantity of personality and flavor in even the most off-hand observations. This technique was so successful in capturing my attention as a reader, that any other minor shortcomings are easily overlooked. In fact, I finished the book happily thinking &quot;wow, what a great book!&quot; and could only really criticize pieces upon reflection.<br />Combined with the plot (yes, somewhat confusing) and the characters (which seem flat on the surface, but are very &quot;real&quot; and likable), this descriptive quality made A Wild Sheep Chase a real joy to read.	2004-05-11

In some of her works, such as \\"Grass\\", \\"Raising the Stones\\", etc., this skill presents itself in a blending of fantasy worlds with an interstellar edge. In \\"Fresco\\", she uses these same skills to expose the myths and rituals of our own planet, politics and religion.<br />The story uses a battered woman as the only honest choice as liaison between Earth and a benevolent alien race. She finds strength in her new freedoms from her husband and evolves as a character from her new friendship with the inhuman ambassadors.<br />Throw in some conflict caused by human-hunting alien dissidents and a meddling right-wing government faction, and the whole book becomes a stew of colorfully marinated satire and social commentary. I would recommend any of Tepper's works, but to some her typical works sometimes seem to derive from an overly feminist cause. \\"Fresco\\" presents the authors beliefs of equality in a more global manner that entertains us and makes us think, and makes us laugh at the simple solutions that our alien suitors develop for some of our most complex social, international and economical problems.<br />Another reviewer commented that The Fresco lacked the subtlety of Tepper's other works, and I have to agree to a certain degree. However, I think the \\"heavy-handedness\\" is a deliberate attempt to illustrate from an alien's perspective just how many social, economic and political problems our world has, in an attempt to create an enjoyable satire for her homo sapient readers.	2004-05-03

The best part about this story is that it uses a classic science fiction mechanism (time travel) and twists it in a unique way, allowing us to delve deeper into some rather well expressed human emotions and motives.<br />I'm sorry, did I say unique? Well, not quite. Read &quot;The Sirens of Titan&quot; (written much much earlier) by Kurt Vonnegut and you will be amazed at the similarities between the &quot;chrono-synclastic infundibulum&quot; and Niffenegger's &quot;Chrono Dispalcement&quot; -- not only in the concept, but in how it is used. Where TTW uses it as a mechanism to analyze the soul in what is essentially a romance-in-sci-fi-clothing, KV uses it to analyze our society in what is essentially a satire-in-sci-fi-clothing. Both use it for very non &quot;sci fi&quot; purposes, which is fine.  I only give the 1-star deduction because the structure and content demands that this book be measured against other literary greats, including Vonnegut's work but also the classic time travel stories, and other less-known gem's such as Thompson's &quot;Timecross'd&quot; (which also tackles the question of humanity through time-travel mechanisms, and does it in a much more entertaining fashion).<br />I would not recommend against reading TTW... although if I had to pick a single piece of time-travel fiction (sci-fi or otherwise), it would not be this.<br />However, if you are looking for good science-fiction look elsewhere. If this rating were specific to the sci-fi genre, I would give the book 2-stars, for in that arena it is weak.	2004-04-21

Like most of Jonjak's work (at least the small bit of which I've seen) Roland is pure energy. It's gut-wrenching honesty thrust into your face with reckless-yet-heartfelt abandon.<br /><br />Despite the book's disclaimer that the author doesn't care about typos, etc. (and I personally dont care much about them either) I took a half-star away for the sheer quantity of them. But then another half-star was added because  the author (according to the jacket) is a wolf and as such it must be fairly difficult to type (although, from the author photo, I would say he  looks more like a German Shepherd).<br /><br />What I loved about Roland was the raw emotion and the non-traditional viewpoint of Roland's life that we are given. Rather than following typical \\"rules\\" of writing, and giving us perfectly timed plot-points and carefully paced story-lines, Roland is presented as small snippets describing various aspects of Roland's life. If you were to empty a case file of a psychotic, paranoid schizophrenic... well, you just might find this book.<br /><br />It read like a series of short-stories, and I found myself skipping ahead and reading chapters out of order. It remained enjoyable nonetheless, and is a testament to how a writer needn't always follow form to create an excellent book.<br /><br />A small warning: it is not for the easily offended or weak-of-heart. Or maybe it is, as the book is full of keen observations about human fallacy that hold some value, even if the lessons may be painful to some.<br /><br />My only real criticism is that the intensity of those lessons may be too much. That is, the book may hold more value if the observations were handed to us more subtly, making us think about them each a bit more. For example, the following was given a whole chapter, although it could have presented in a much more subtle way:<br /><br />\\"The people who surrounded the water cooler recognized the joke and recognized its affiliation with the TV program. They didn't recognize Fred Bartlett's cleverness because there wasn't any, but they recognized what they generally accepted in place of cleverness and so they laughed. Not because they were moved to laugh, but because the moment called for it.\\"<br /><br />By harping on a point for too long, the \\"Unconsidered Negative Effects of TV Imprinting\\" becomes something overly associated with the insane Roland and is therefore less of a statement about our true society.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes to think for themselves, doesn't mind some blunt and often  negative energy, and who appreciates the quirkiness of true independent writing.<br /><br />[Edit: Shameless self-promotion: my book [[ASIN:1419682644 Cluck: Murder Most Fowl]] is also an excellent example of independent writing, -edk]V program.

This was a book that at once fueled my teenage-born desire to fight \\"the man\\" and inspired me to become a science fiction author myself.<br /><br />So why am I writing this review now, more that a decade (sadly, much more than a decade) after high school? Well, I just read F451 again. It is now April, 2004. I am amazed at just how accurate Bradbury's future is. If the \\"slaves to our TV's\\" accusation doesn't strike close enough to the bulls-eye, just look at the role of war in F451 and then turn on CNN and watch for 5 minutes.<br /><br />Bradbury has hit the nail on its proverbial head; in his verbose-yet-eloquent style he  has painted a horrible and terrifying future where man fears and scorns knowledge and wisdom. It has gotten to the point where firemen no longer put out fires, but start them--to burn the books which embody everything that is dangerous to a society that fears free will.<br /><br />Reading this again, now, I couldn't help resurrecting a memory. I was at work in the high-tech field (before the crash)... I make a habit of either reading or writing during my lunch hour, and a coworker had made a comment along the lines of \\"why on Earth would you read a book when you can get all the entertainment you'd ever want online?\\". Reading F451, I remember this person, and imagine them in a \\"parlor\\" with their fabricated online \\"Tv walls\\" that cater to their egos and their banal desire for raw and stupid entertainment.<br /><br />My advice to those who don't typically read, those who have siblings or offspring who do not read, and those who think anything that isn't digital is unworthy of their attention: Read this book. The main story (sans afterword, etc.) is only about 160 pages long. There's no excuse. read it.<br /><br />Those who do read (and especially those who write): this is a classic for a reason, and Bradbury's poetic quality is very enjoyable. He creates only a few characters in this book, but from the start you have such depth in the lead man (montag) that you feel pity for him as his wife's stomach is pumped, and you understand why he is drawn to the spirit that is Clarisse. Because you will have the privilege of reading this far beyond the time in which it was written, you will both fear the \\"hound\\" and relate to it. You will also relate to the TV walls and (unless you live underground in isolation) you will begin to fear what the modern media has become.<br /><br />[edit - You shouldn't burn books.  Certainly not [[ASIN:1419682644 Cluck: Murder Most Fowl]].  I wrote it, so please forgive the self-promotion, but also please check out my book.

It makes a rather profound statement about learning to get on with your life after something bad happens to you... which in and of itself is well and good. But it wraps it up in the wrong package, twisting a fairly harmless philosophy around. That it, instead of teaching people the value in working through a loss, they try to convince people in advance that it is OK to expect a loss and not to fight it when it happens.<br />It's corporate brainwashing of the kind that science fiction writers have been warning us about for decades.<br />I'm not being a comedian: I know of at least three large companies that did (a) and have had conversations with executives that boast (b). That is why this book is still a best-seller... not because it has any literary merit, philosophical worth, or any value whatsoever. Too bad there isn't a &quot;zero&quot; star rating.	2004-03-29
US	39690302	RCT5WJBKTJAZR	0345460952	458212829	The Salmon of Doubt	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Part of me hated this book	...but only because it was a sad reminder that one of the greatest minds in literature, and one of my own greatest influences, is gone.<br />I've been an avid fan of Adam's ever since I was a kid. I remember laughing out loud at The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy and watching my parent's amazed expressions... &quot;he's laughing at a book?&quot; I also remember that, when sitting on an airplane, on my way to disney land, sticking the paperback in the seat-pocket in front of me and realizing with much delight that the &quot;hitchhiking hand&quot; on the cover looks a lot like a bum* when you turn it upside down and then cover up the bottom half.... but I digress.<br />This book will appeal to two types of people. Those who are, like me, fans of Douglas Adams and are rabid to gain more of his wit, humor and insight will definitely enjoy getting this last bitter-sweet sample of his work.<br />However, it will also appeal to anyone who enjoys a religious, socioeconomic or environmental debate. So much more real than the Hitchhiker books, Adam's various essays and articles apply his intellect (which is significant) and an almost frighteningly open mind to many important and delicate issues.<br />Those who are looking for another complete Dirk Gently story will be sadly disappointed, unless they enjoy reading an incomplete, very early draft of the never-to-be-completed installment that is provided at the end of the book. Lucky for me, I did enjoy it. In fact, I loved it; It was a fantastic study of Adams' technique, although it was very hard to close the book afterwards. I'm still in denial that it is all over.<br />Eric D. Knapp<br />PS - If anyone cares to know, my own author-photo that I used on my first book was a sort of tribute to Douglas Adams. I remember his early books, that all had the same photo of Adams on the cover. It was oddly distorted by an early version MacDraw (or some such ancient Mac program), and I always said to myself &quot;If I ever publish a book, I'm going to put a goofy picture of myself on the cover, too.&quot; Well, I did. And I did. Thanks, Doug.<br />*EDIT: I can't put URLs on an amazon review, but I've posted the Hitchhiker-cover-to-bum-conversion experiment on my web site...

US	39690302	R36AADJYKEKNXH	0441007988	149450515	Ship of Fools	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Great despite a lack of closure	If Ship of Fools had more of a conclusion, it would have been at the top of my list. However, Russo seems to have grown tired toward the end, and the pure energy that fills the first 805 of the book is lost.<br />Still, Ship of Fools is full of excitement and discovery. Despite being set in a cliche (the &quot;colony of people who live on a ship and have never set foot on a planet&quot; cliche), Russo manages to pull of a highly original series of events. All of them surround the discovery of a mysterious vessel, which keeps a singular focus within the story. However, the events themselves range from death to inner conflict to paranoia to sympathy. Ultimately, it is a tale of exploration that is approached from many levels, grounded in the most obvious exploration -- that of the ship.<br />If only it had an end, it would be a 5-star book. When I finished reading it, I immediately went online to order the sequel... I just assumed there was one, and was devastated when I learned otherwise.<br />I would still recommend this highly to those looking for an interesting story about discovery and exploration, and anyone who enjoys reading because it makes you think. For those who look to sci-fi for space battles and combat and three-breasted she-beasts... well, while there is a cloud of danger and some action, this probably is not what you're looking for.	2004-03-11
US	39690302	R1O8HLEZ6KWOS1	0743234901	530210334	Out of the Silent Planet (Space Trilogy (Paperback))	Books	5	1	2	N	Y	Philisophy is the Heart of Science Fiction	...and Lewis does an excellent job combining opinions on ethics, religion and the fundamentals of humanity into an entertaining tale. I am a sci-fi author myself, and what I've found is that many sci-fi writers either sacrifice a good story in order to make a strong point, or they fail to make a point at all in an effort to create a fun story. Lewis is adept at providing both.<br />Interestingly, although I am an avid sci-fi reader (obviously), I had never read much of Lewis' work until now. I recently picked up Out of the Silent Planet because someone compared the main character from my own book to that of Ransom. There's no way I could hear such a comparison and not immediately rush off to buy the book and see for myself... after all, being compared to a classic author such as Lewis is a real honor!<br />Reading the book from this angle caused me to focus deeply on the literary structure and character development within the book. Ransom is a character that you can relate to immediately -- despite the generational gaps between author and reader -- and you can understand his fear, wonder, and intrigue as he finds himself on a new world. The descriptions are inspiring yet not overly lost in details, allowing the reader to use his or her own imagination to create a landscape and society as diverse and colorful as Ransom himself must have found it.<br />In short, he successfully delivers a sense of wonder and amazement to the reader. The action, dialog, etc. are well used as well, but it is definitely the sense of adventure and awe that made me slap my forehead and say &quot;why haven't I read this until now?&quot;<br />While many younger readers may balk at the language (which has a decidedly &quot;old&quot; feel to it), I would recommend this as required reading. It is as much something to learn from as it is to enjoy.	2004-03-11

There is<br />potential for the speculative application of philosophy, religion, and<br />science. There is the potential for plot-twists and surprises. There is<br />also the potential for pure confusion and, as a result, unreadable<br />stories. Timecross'd accomplishes the first two, and escapes the third,<br />in an action-packed time adventure that is both fun and exciting. I<br />recommend it highly.<br /><br />The story involves the aptly named \\"loop\\" -- a time machine which is<br />the temporal equivalent to the portal in the movie \\"Stargate\\" -- which<br />is used effectively to create \\"loops\\" in the plot's timeline. The love<br />story is always present, though it often takes a back seat as the<br />characters involved forget their emotions in an effort to focus on<br />survival. This book has everything from nazis to Shakespeare, however,<br />and despite what you are looking for in a book, there is a good chance<br />you will find it here. The only thing that I felt was out of place was<br />a slightly awkward love scene in pre-history.  Overall, the story<br />progressed rapidly and kept the reader interested in the delightfully<br />dysfunctional cast.<br /><br />I also feel that the subtitle and cover detract somewhat from the<br />quality of the book. I had passed this book up on several occasions<br />because the cover gave the impression of a romantic comedy. After<br />seeing that several readers recommended my own books [[ASIN:0595302130 Out of Place Out of Time: The Testimony of Dr. Trenton Stowel]] and [[ASIN:1419682644 Cluck: Murder Most Fowl]] in addition to Timecross'd, I picked it up and was<br />delightfully surprised to find a thoughtful and adventurous story that<br />offers far more.	2004-03-08

Yet, despite the \\"popping between time\\" of Pilgrim that tries to defy a physical setting, the story remains solidly anchored within an emotional setting: the bombing of Dresden (WWII), which keeps everything in perspective. Tralfamadore, and many of the \\"non-linear\\" qualities of the story could as easily be the creation and fixation of a weakened mind, just as much as they could be (?) real. You never know. Vonnegut always keeps you guessing.<br />SH-5 is a great introduction to Vonnegut. If you enjoy this one, I would recommend moving in either one of two ways: for those who liked the character elements and emotional qualities, move to \\"Bluebeard\\". For those who were more intrigued by Pilgrim's temporal displacement, try \\"The Sirens of Titan\\" next.	2004-02-19

Adams' wit and humor make an enjoyable read out of what could only otherwise be called a depressing topic. Still, through Adams' intelligent yet non-zoological eyes, we are shown areas of the world we will otherwise never see. The portrayal of the Kimono dragons, early in the book, is a shocking representation of what a a majestic reptile has been reduced to, and at the same time a morbid reminder of how wretched humans can be. Yet, due to Adams' skill we are able to feel his wonder and his fascination. We are able to get past the uncomfortable aspects of animal extinction, so that we can look it square in the eye and learn from it.<br />As much value on a humanitarian, ecological and zoological level as on a literary one. Adams' himself calls it his most prized and significant writing (I'm paraphrasing, read &quot;Salmon of Doubt&quot; to get his words).<br />I'd give it three thumbs up, but I only have two.	2004-02-17

It's quirky, bizarre, and makes a point about the human race that deserves some credit I think.<br />Did I mention it is quirky? Several techniques (the use of the asterisk is my favorite) are used to add flavor and flare to this tale, making everything seem a bit irrelevant. Yet, I think that is the point really. 4 stars...<br />Should I have given 5 stars? It's better than most contemporary fiction, just not up to Vonnegut's own standards.	2004-02-17

Larson does not have this problem. The Devil in the White City combines a fascinating point in time (the creation of the Chicago World's Fair) with the frightening events surrounding an historical character of that time: a morbid yet fascinating serial killer, who preyed on ladies at the fair (among others). Did Erik Larson luck out and stumble upon a story so fascinating that his book had no choice but to succeed? Maybe, but critiquing the book as an author I find it well written and complex enough to stand up on its own strengths. I look forward to new works by Larson, should they appear.<br />(Also, he has a great name... what can I say?)	2004-02-17

He is one of the strongest influences on my own writing. However, while I usually find his stories full of real characters who are in unreal situations (Time Quake, Galapagos, etc.) Bluebeard is full of real characters in a very real setting. It is a character story through and through, and is refreshingly Earth-bound. If you like Vonnegut but dislike his tendencies towards sci-fi, you'll love this book.

You won't find another story out there that is constructed like this one. Why do I give it 5 stars? Because that takes guts, but mostly because vonnegut pulls it off. It's a very difficult thing to change the underlying form of storytelling... most readers don't like it. They get caught up in the presentation of the story and forget to pay attention to what's happening.<br />Well, Timequake is non-linear and wild. It is chaotic, but not in the sense of being poorly written. It's chaotic in the same way that a handful of diamonds thrown into a salad mixer would be chaotic; fascinating, somewhat worrisome, and in an odd way brilliant.<br />I would recommend Timequake to Vonnegut fans, certainly, but also to any serious reader or writer of fiction. Use it as a lesson in thinking outside of the norm. There's a lot to be learned from Timequake.	2004-02-17

I think that Rowling does this wonderfully, which is one of the reasons that the Harry Potter books are as successful as they are. However, if the true target is for children, I think that the fifth book lacks a lot of what the first four thrived on: friendly good-versus-evil conflicts and right-always-prevails adventure. The Order of The Phoenix is a much darker story... due to both the return of Voldemort and also due to harry's complete inability to deal with growing up.  I like to think that Harry's behavior is the result of the onset of puberty, but regardless of its cause the loss of complexity in his character is disappointing. Realistic? Sure, but the point was over-stated and it made harry seem like a whining, unlikable prat. He's been proven to be a better person than that in the previous four books, which makes me question this sudden lack of character. Still: I give it 5 stars as a children's book.<br />Judging the book against adult criteria, the novel falls flat. The plot is written in painful accordance to Rowling's proven formula, repeating the exact same progression as the previous four novels. Start with escape from dursleys... Introduce new and interesting magical thing on the way to hogwarts... then something happens to harry but nobody believes him... and then they realize its true but for some reason the adults can't help... and then the mysterious thing that was introduced at the start reappears to help harry save the day. If this was intended for adult readers, that tired formula alone would be worth giving this fifth book of the series a 3-star review. However, I realize that it is primarily intended for kids, so I'll stick with 5 stars. I'd give four-and-a-half if that was an option.<br />Don't get me wrong -- it was enjoyable, and I'll be first in line for book #6. As a book for the entertainment of kids (or adults who want brain-candy), The Order of The Phoenix delivers. Despite the many flaws I've read it three times through because, ultimately, it is a very fun read.Order of The Phoenix delivers.
