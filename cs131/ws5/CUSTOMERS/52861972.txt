He recreates detail that makes him into an omniscient narrator. For example, he reads Condi Rice's mind and strongly implies she was utterly ignorant about Al Qaeda. That's more than a tiny bit presumptuous. <br /> <br />It also would help if just once, in his memoir, he didn't claim that he had made every call correctly. If it had been written in Lincoln's time, there would have been a passage where he writes, \\"I strongly opposed the choice of Ford's Theater, as the strong sentiment of the southern actors was well known. Unfortunately, my warning fell on deaf ears.\\" <br /> <br />His treatment of Clinton's Mogadishu omits key facts that he must be aware of. It's utterly dishonest to say that Clinton is criticized for the deaths of 18 American soldiers. Rather, the criticism is that Clinton's response was to say, \\"Absolutely no more casualties. Let's formally recognized the man we were trying to arrest -- pick him up in a limousine instead of chains.\\" Whether or not that criticism is fair, the reader deserves to hear it stated correctly before it can be rejected or accepted. <br /> <br />His treatment of the Millennium plot ignores the fact that NONE of his preparedness exercises were responsible for catching the LAX bomber -- it was a complete fluke, a customs official at the border deciding to pull a nervous guy out of the line, a man who then panicked and fled. Had he played it cool, LAX would have been bombed. Interestingly, Clarke's hero Sandy Berger was just convicted of illegal removing and destroying the after-action reports on the Millennium plot. A wild guess is that they painted Berger and Clarke's efforts as insufficient. <br /> <br />Clarke is never bothers to meet his opponents objections. He mischaracterizes arguments about the Iraq terrorism connection (arguments that he himself is on record making in the late 90's,when he claimed that the al-Shifa plant in the Sudan was making chem weapons with much help from the Iraqis). He gratuitously slanders Laurie Mylroie by totally misstating her theory about an Iraq connection to the first WTC bombing. <br /> <br />You'd have to go back to the Nixon Administration and its aftermath to find someone so intent on covering his ass and denying the obvious fact about his legacy. <br /> <br />Clarke depicts himself consistently as the smartest guy in the room in any situation. A small ego he does not have. No mean feat, considering he failed in his main responsibility for 9 years. <br /> <br />On the positive side, you do get an occasionally interesting behind-the-scenes look at U.S. counter-terrorism policy.	2005-10-03

Pilgrim Fellowship Of Faith: The Church As Communion <br />is as good a place as any to start to gain insight into the man. <br /> <br />A collection of speeches, papers, and letters collected by his students for his 75th birthday, it examines the relationship between theology, faith, ecclesiology, and sacrament. It reveals a man who strives to be ecumenical in the most serious way -- who seeks real dialogue, which requires all participants to be as honest and searching about their beliefs and to accord dignity and respect to other interlocutors. This collection includes gracious letter exchanges with Orthodox Metropolitan Damaskinos of Switzerland and with Lutheran Provincial Bishop Johannes Hanselmann of Bavaria.  <br /> <br />In the course of the works cited, Ratzinger deals in depth with these and other questions: What is theology, what is its relation to faith, and how can her methods lay claim to providing knowledge? What is the role of the Holy Spirit in ecclesiology, in our understanding of the Church? What is the relation between Communion as Eucharist and communion as Christian fellowship, and how does christology shape ecclesiology? What role to lay movements serve in the Church? How does the Church go about remembering and atoning for sins?  <br /> <br />If there is a common theme, it is the primacy communion -- a vision of God as triune communion, a vision of the Universal Church with many local churches in communion, a vision of the ecumenical movement as a striving to realize Christian communion as a gift from God, a vision of sacraments as visible signs of communion. Also interesting is what he declares communion not to be. Specifically, it is not to be taken as a cover for blanket centralization of ecclesiastical authority in Rome. <br /> <br />It's a good read. A comparison with Wojtyla's style is perhaps inevitable. Ratzinger's writing is perhaps more pragmatic and concise, less gradiose. There's a quiet precision and grace here. Ratzinger seems like a quiet, patient teacher, a somewhat self-effacing man with a penetrating mind. It's an excellent way for Catholics to begin to learn their new pope's mind. It's a great book for other Christians who want an insight into how ecumenism fits into Pope Benedict's theological views. It's also a good book for non-Christians who wonder how the Church sees itself.	2005-08-12
US	52861972	R254IZGKWDLQOK	0374505241	113731400	The Violent Bear It Away: A Novel	Books	5	16	18	N	N	Uncontrollable spirits, orphans,	The Violent Bear It Away was O'Connor's second and last novel. Gripping and sickening, it tells the story of a strong-willed, self-declared prophet in a Georgia backwater, his rationalist nephew struggling to free himself from the influence of his uncle's misguided zeal, and his reluctant successor grandnephew, all of them working out their destiny frenetically and enthusiastically, with terrifying consequences. <br /> <br />The world of this novel is a place where familial relations exist, but appear as if in funhouse mirror images. The odd circumstance is that apparently almost everyone is someone's uncle. Prophet Mason Tarwater is schoolteacher Rayber's uncle. Rayber is, in turn the uncle of prophet-in-training Francis Tarwater, who has lived all his life with his great uncle Mason. These avuncular relationships approximate and seem to replace the paternal ones, but inadequately. And mothers qua mothers are absent entirely: women are only referred to in conversation, never seen in the actual novel, and the characters can only see the women who are mothers as whores or as confused women on a voyage of self-discovery. \\"Mother\\" is not in our characters' lexicon. <br /> <br />Reflecting this, the actions of the Tarwaters reveal a distorted and truncated trinitarianism, in which Father and Son are subsumed into the Spirit and vanish, leaving blind enthusiasm outside of relationship and fellow feeling. Similarly, Rayber is possessed of an impersonal drive to rational goodness, to the betterment of his fellow man. His uncle rejects him because he insists on holding all things and persons in the world in abstract judgment within his mind; both elder and younger Tarwaters refuse to let Rayber place them \\"inside his head,\\" to reduce them from acting subjects to intellectual objects. Rayber paradoxically struggles to deny his natural affections for his retarded son Bishop. He seems capable of loving only in the abstract, indeed, to be following some rationalist maxim to stamp out the irrational wellsprings of love for his insufficiently gifted son. <br /> <br />It's powerful work. The first two parts in particular are tight and arresting leading to a tragic climax. The third part is somewhat cryptic. I have no idea how O'Connor intends us to take Francis Tarwater's resolution at the end of the novel, but that's a strength. This is a novel to be read again. <br /> <br />John Huston created a movie adaptation of O'Connor's first novel, Wise Blood, which I saw many years ago. Of directors working today, someone like Robert Duvall seems well-suited temperamentally and artistically for realizing O'Connor's terrifying and befuddling visions. However it happens, Flannery O'Connor's work deserves to be brought to life for another generation of viewers and readers.	2005-07-25

Again, as with most polemical books, it's best to read it quickly. Unlike many of these instant bestsellers, Men in Black is informed by a passion for historical detail and context. While to some extent it's a laundry list of grievances for strict constructionist critics of the court (grievances I generally share), what leavens the reading and makes it enjoyable are thumbnail bios of select Justices through history and the historical incidents that shaped the court, such as FDR's controversial attempt to pack the court in the 30's, and the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase in 1804.     A couple of nits: Levin dedicates a chapter to Marbury v. Madison, the landmark case that established the principle of judicial review early in the history of our country. This leaves the reader wondering whether Marbury itself is an example of judicial overreach -- a finding that Levin implies but doesn't state explicitly. While the idea that judicial activism became something that was destined to grow after Marbury has much to commend it, Levin should have pointed out that for a long time after Marbury, judicial review was quite limited. As Professor Robert Lowry Clinton has pointed out in First Things: \\"A limited form of judicial review was already established by 1800, but only for relatively 'clear cases.' Marbury did not alter this, but rather established a clear precedent for the Court's power to disregard congressional laws in cases 'of a judiciary nature'-cases in which judicial functions were threatened by application of a questionable statutory provision. Marbury established only that the judiciary would play an important role in constitutional interpretation, not that it would play the ultimate role.\\"    This is vital for fully understanding Levin's criticism of President George W. Bush's failure to veto the McCain-Feingold law, a law which the President claimed was unconstitutional at least in part, but about which he decided to defer to the Supreme Court. Levin and Professor Clinton both see this as a dereliction of duty, brought on by a pattern of acquiescence to judicial usurpation by both the legislative and executive branches of government.    It's also not clear that Plessy v. Ferguson's infamous holding supporting \\"separate but equal\\" accommodations for whites and blacks result from judicial activism. It's an intriguing idea, but Levin doesn't really flesh out his argument. We really need to read the Fourteenth Amendment more closely and examine the arguments (revisiting Justice Harlan's dissent would also help).    Maybe I'm expecting too much from Levin here -- for a general audience, it may not be appropriate to get bogged down in legal hermeneutics. But even in the best of worlds, the Supreme Court does need to do hermeneutics, even if it does it well, that is, strictly and faithfully.    All that said, there is a lot to be learned from this, and I'm thankful to Levin for having written it.	2005-07-13

If you've never read The Complete Stories of Flannery O'Connor, read it now. If you have, read it again this summer. Winner of the 1971 National Book Award, these are mighty strange stories of broken people in a fallen world: hermaphrodites who proclaim themselves visible, inscrutable sign of God; physically maimed men and women, tormented by spirits and passions they can't fathom; landowners, poor whites and blacks colluding in nameless, unspeakable guilt. <br /> <br />O'Connor's work, at its best, made manifest and palpable abstractions such as sin and redemption. Her work shouts of a world of spirit that is larger than all our categories and schema, encountered in experience but never contained or mastered. Only through difficult and painful revelation can the Kingdom be realized. Writing about the South in the middle of the twentieth century, her work is suffused with the divisions and nuances of race and class. She was a master of the short story form, as well. You get the solid setup, the telling character detail, the punch at the end of the story. Especially good are \\"Parker's Back,\\" \\"The Displaced Person,\\" \\"The Life You Save May Be Your Own,\\" \\"A Temple of the Holy Ghost,\\" \\"Good Country People,\\" \\"The Comforts of Home,\\" \\"The Lame Shall Enter First,\\" and the classic \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find.\\" This is a wonderful anthology of work from a powerful writer.

It's a pretty good workout; my impression is that I've only sampled something, without having enough time to properly consider his wide-ranging discussion. It's simultaneous a work of Christian apologetics, theology, philosophy, historiography, and Biblical criticism. Its influence, overwhelming in medieval times, persists to the current day. It's a demanding work, but it can be read without any specialized historical knowledge. <br /> <br />Augustine reflects deeply here on human nature and the meaning of eternal life and eternal punishment, within an explication of the \\"meaning\\" of history. He writes of all human history as a single narrative. This also a work of Biblical exegesis, as Augustine treats Scripture as a historical document. For Augustine, creation is good, creation exists in time and has a history. Indeed, since God enters into history to show man His love, history itself is sanctified, through the City of God. <br /> <br />The book contains the parallel histories of what Augustine terms the City of God and the City of Man, both descended from Adam. The City of Man is founded on murder (specifically fratricide, the murder of a brother, viz. Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus). The City of Man has been deceived and debased, fallen under the sway of pagan gods, which appear to be either demons or, at best indifferent or benign spirits that are mistakenly worshipped. The City of God, on the other hand, is a pilgrim on this earth, toiling here in the joyous expectation of final salvation in God's Kingdom. <br /> <br />Augustine wants to explain the ways of God to man, but he does this from some humility, expressing his speculation in doubt. City of God also shows Augustine to be interested in the goods of Greek and Roman philosophy and rhetoric and in purging the negative elements of these while and Christian revelation. He's always intent on removing the possibility of gnostic/Manichaean distortions of Christian texts, such as St. Paul's admonitions not to \\"live according to the flesh\\" but rather \\"according to the spirit.\\" Augustine is clear that this does not mean disdain for the body, but that one should refuse to live according to human ways, and consent to live by God's will. <br /> <br />Again, there's no way to give an adequate summary of a book like this, but it is surprising readable (if voluminous). I'm sorry I waited as long as I did to read it. <br /> <br />The translation here is readable, the abridgement makes the work as a whole accessible to a casual reader, and Etienne Gilson's foreword and Bourke's introduction are good companions.	2005-06-22

When I was in college, Douglas Adams had a cult following that knew all the jokes and could quote them to each other.    I find myself in a middle ground. I was first exposed to Hitchhiker's Guide when it ran as a BBC radio serial (I heard it on NPR, I think). It got a some laughs out of me, and I enjoyed it, but it didn't inspire in me the kind of devotion that it did in other geeks.    Having read the first book, I have to say the radio series is my favorite presentation of this material. Playing as a serial, the gags were front and center, the serial format left the listener with the impression that there was a lot more to come and ensured that Adams didn't overstay his welcome. Read as a novel, the book seems a little pointless. Adams wouldn't know a narrative arc if it hit him.    That said, a lot of the jokes are still funny. Adams was a vocal atheist, and at his best he has the satiric touch of a Voltaire. Evenhanded, he enjoys skewering atheists in his book: Oolon Coluphid, the atheist writer that Adams posits as \\"the author of philosophical blockbusters,\\" seems quite pretentious and silly, at least in his choice of book titles.    Occasionally, there is a true insight that is nicely played for a joke. My favorite revolves around the babelfish, a fish that is used a universal translator. When a babelfish is placed in one's hear, one can hear and understand the words spoken by another, regardless of the original language spoken. The end of Adams digression on the babelfish ends with the acidly ironic observation that the babelfish is responsible for more wars than any other species in the universe.    (John Durham Peters, author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, makes the point that we often hold an implicitly utopian view of communication, believing that differences between people will automatically be resolved with better communication, whereas sometimes the truth is the opposite: the better two groups of people understand each other, the less they like each other.)    I place Adams in the same category as Kurt Vonnegut. They're both writers that have a special appeal to the young, to high school and college age readers. They both write satirical, absurdist fiction which skewer traditional beliefs and middle class norms. Adams tends to be more detached, more bemused, less pointed, passionate, and angry than Vonnegut. In some ways, that makes him easier to take. On the other hand, I don't think he's as compelling, for the same reason.	2005-06-01

A strange book, borrowing nearly everything from other works in antiquity, it remains entirely original. Virgil takes his readers through the adventures of a band of refugees who are on their way to their destiny, the founding of the Roman republic. Unlike Odysseus, Aeneas is fleeing defeat and destruction, not returning to his homeland as a conquering hero. <br /> <br />It's a great book. Aeneas, full of nobility, is not outsized in nearly inhuman greatness like Achilles. He's not the resourceful Everyman that Odysseus is. Aeneas is bound by duty and piety and finds his identity in them. There's something here that a lot of fathers and sons can relate to, the grim determination to be faithful to clan and vocation. <br /> <br />There's also a disturbing sense of circularity here. According to legend, Dardanus, the founder of Troy, was an emigrant from Italy, so his descendant, the refugee Aeneas, is also returning to a storied ancestral homeland in returning to Latium. In completing this circle, he finds himself in Carthage with Queen Dido, dooming her and setting up an emnity between Rome and Carthage that will come to fruition in the bloody Punic Wars that result in the total destruction of Carthage. Upon landing in Latium, he wrests the princess Lavinia from a would-be suitor Turnus, thus reenacting the ravishing of Helen by Alexander, and in the same manner, this causes a bloody war and siege. All history is a vertiginous cycle, round and round, no rest from the iron cycles of history, no respite from the caprices of the gods. <br /> <br />At the center of this is a journey to the underworld, similar to the one in the Odyssey. Unlike that trip, in this journey our hero passes through the netherworld to the upper regions, the Elysian fields, which somehow seem less than heavenly: they appear more like a pleasant distracting earthly holiday in a nice bit of real estate. From this vantage, Aeneas's dead father Anchises surveys future Roman history and the critical role his descendents will play in it. <br /> <br />Fitzgerald's translation is commendable. A friend compared it to Ray Bradbury, and I quite like that: strong, vigorous, manly, unpretentious. This a gift to give yourself, something you can keep going back to your whole life.	2005-05-14

A former Soviet dissident and currently active in Israeli politics (he resigned today from the Israeli cabinet today), Sharansky defends this thesis: instead of dividing foreign policy theorists into realpolitik \\"realists\\" who prop up friendly foreign governments even when those are run by regimes that abuse their own people and Wilsonian \\"idealists\\" who see foreign policy as a way of achieving humanitarian goals, we should recognize that the promotion of democracy around the world is vital to the self-interests of countries like the U. S. Sharansky sees the desire to find non-democratic strongmen who can secure peace for Western democracies to be a failing that we have made time and again, whether we speak of the U.S. policy of detente, or Israel's attempt to forge a peace in the 1990's by effectively setting up Yasser Arafat as a Palestinian enforcer. <br /> <br />What makes this book more than just another bit of political theorizing is the personal perspective that Sharansky brings to these situations. When he was a dissident, he saw first-hand how terrified totalitarian regimes were of people who were willing to speak the truth. While in Israel, he saw how democracies were willing to deal with the devil himself if that devil promised peace. He also saw that the devil is incapable of delivering peace, as he rules and derives his power by inciting war -- peace renders him impotent. <br /> <br />Natan Sharansky's nice mix of memoir and advocacy is worth a read. I hope he has some influence in the way we think about foreign policy.	2005-05-03

Drawing on history of Polish national identity, the late Pope sees both nations and the Church as proper repositories of memory, memory being that which makes possible the expression of identity. Europe is in danger of losing that notion of identity, of becoming unrecognizable to itself, of losing the humanism that Christianity has helped it to attain. The dangers in the West are not limited to obvious totalitarian movements like communism and fascism, but include more insidious forms of moral and spiritual decay. These are fruitful ideas to consider when thinking about the current Church, and Pope Benedict's choice of the name of the patron of Europe indicates that he and John Paul shared an enthusiasm for the importance of the continent right now. <br /> <br />In reflecting on intellectual history, John Paul attempts to fuse objective/realist traditions (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas) with subjective/personalist ones (Augustine, Descartes, Kant, phenomenology). He makes an effort to treat modern thought respectfully, calling attention to the good within Kant and the Enlightenment while also acknowledging their excesses and defects. These passages make him sound very much like Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor. <br /> <br />This last book in some ways is a good introduction to Wojtyla the intellectual, integrating his personalist philosophy, his political views, his poetic and dramatic visions, and his ecclesiology in one conversational book. Buy a copy and read it.	2005-04-25

The catch is that Dante is largely untranslated on these shores -- making Longfellow and Co. themselves prime suspects, a fact which, if revealed to the police would incriminate them and put their beloved (as yet unfinished) translation in jeopardy. So poet/intellectuals must turn sleuths. <br /> <br />It's a well-written piece of historical fiction, drawing on the real life successes and tragedies of these nineteenth century figures and set against a country still in exhaustion from the terrors of the Civil War. Pearl actually does work (unlike, say Dan Brown) to flesh out his characters. Details like the tragic deaths of Lowell's and Longfellow's wives add richness, and Boston and Cambridge are vividly depicted. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the solution to the whodunnit seemed a tiny bit of a cheat. (But I won't give any spoilers.) <br /> <br />Pearl is a member of the current day successor to Longfellow's \\"Dante Club,\\" the Dante Society of America. Knowing the little I know about both Dante and Longfellow's time, the novel rang pretty true. <br /> <br />An enjoyable way to pass the time.	2005-04-06

It's very straightforward, is readable, and at the same time comes close to being a bulleted listing of Dan Brown's errors. The sheer volumes of easily checked factual errors in Brown's book is astonishing. As Olson and Miesel write, DVC does not pass the \\"desktop encyclopedia\\" test. <br /> <br />The target audience is educated Catholics who may have burning doubts as a result of reading not just Brown's books, but also those of his betters: e.g., Elaine Pagels's books on gnosticism, Margaret Starbird, and other would-be reformers who would recast Catholicism in a form acceptable to the editorial board of the New York Times. These books have a higher level of scholarship <br /> <br />There's also interesting bits of history to glean here, one of the lures of the original novel. The Templars, the Council of Nicaea, Constantine, Mary Magdalene, the history of the New Testament canon, Grail legends, all these appear here, demystified and explained. My only wish is that they had spent more time outlining in a positive way the history of Grail legend. Ah, but that is another book for another time.	2005-03-08

Tony Hendra's Father Joe occasionally has the quality of candy: a joy, a treat, and 20 minutes later . . . . a little disappointment mixed with craving for more. In this memoir of considerable style and charms, Hendra, an accomplished writer and performer who first came to fame as an editor and writer at the satire magazine National Lampoon, explores his relationship with Dom Joseph Warrilow, an English Benedictine priest who served as his mentor and friend, off and on through the years, from Hendra's adolescence in the 50's until Warrilow's death in the late 90's. <br /> <br />First, a couple of jarring notes: there are several outbursts of left-liberal polemic that are misplaced. Father Joe comes across in the memoir as relaxedly apolitical. Perhaps the diatribes merely recount Hendra's attitude at the time. He depicts Father Joe ever so gently taking him to task for a lack of charity and a closing of his heart in his strident attitudes while not contradicting his political leanings. Later, the reader gets the sense that Hendra is defending his current views. It all has little to do with Father Joe and everything to do with Tony Hendra. Given our memories of 1980's events, it's extremely hard for us to take someone seriously who praises \\"men of peace like . . . Mikhail Gorbachev\\" for magnanimously and unilaterally ending the Cold War and liberals within \\"the stubborn populations of Europe - my contemporaries and their parents - who for all their manifest mindlessness and endless tribal squabbles had remained a generation of peace, refusing to buy Reagan's fatuous cartoon of the Russian people or be cowed by his cowardly weapons of mass murder\\" (p. 237) Perhaps Hendra should consult Russians such as Natan Sharansky and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn about how the Russian people were treated by the Evil Warmongering President Reagan. An angry aside decrying \\"the Church's relentless intolerance of different sexual orientations\\" (p. 269) comes out of the blue without warning.<br /> <br />Given that this is book is a good deal about Hendra, it's telling to see where he focuses. The best of the book is Part One, his description of his childhood encounter with Sin, Monasticism, and Father Joe. He spins a good yarn about family, adultery, and rites of passage that brings many smiles and sighs to the reader. The suddenly, at the outset of Part Two, 20 years have gone by, and Hendra is removed from England to Southern California, contemplating suicide in a drug-addled state. He gives very little sense of the first ten of those twenty years -- he alludes vaguely to the difficulties of launching his career in America, the details of his first marriage are sketchy, and he never even bothers to name the daughters from that marriage. In part two, Father Joe is absent more than present, and Hendra presents himself schizophrenically -- self-effacingly making light of his talents, yet only detailing the periods in his life when he achieved some amount of worldly success. Thus Father Joe dwells on topics with little relation to Father Joe: National Lampoon, Not the New York Times, Not the Wall Street Journal, Spinal Tap, and Spitting Image. None of this would be news to Hendra. He indicts himself over and over again for self-obsession and self-centeredness. He is a man with a profound sense of sin, struggling to believe in a God of unbounded love. <br /> <br />But let's grant that this book is as much about Hendra as it is about Father Joe. This is an utterly endearing book. Hendra, a gifted writer with a wonderful tone and an excellent ear, conveys the precious quality of presence by reflecting on its opposite, absence. Between the two, by the grace of God, we encounter the Other, our neighbor. Everything in Father Joe's story suggests he had a special grace, a fabulous gift from God, that enabled him to enter into true friendship and community with quite a few people, to truly listen and truly love, making him present even when absent. Hendra navigates between absence and presence in this book, his goal being to make Father Joe alive, both for us and for himself. Still, we worry about Hendra, for whom presence and absence have formed difficult waters throughout his life, sometimes nearly unnavigable -- the book contains a vivid anecdote recalling a chilling early intimation of damnation as a cold eternal absence of God. It's not clear whether or how strongly he sees Father Joe as but one earthly face of the ever-present Christ.

George Weigel may have taken Mann's maxim to heart when writing this massive biography of Pope John Paul II. Extensively researched and meticulously cross-referenced, this 900-plus page book seems to approach its subject by subtly appropriating methods and styles associated with the Pope, viz.,  <br /> <br />1) Weigel places the focus of the book on the person of Karol Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II), rather than on abstract questions of ecclesiology, theology, or politics; <br /> <br />2) he approaches his subject discursively and from as many different perspectives and backgrounds as possible, taking the reader through fascinating presentations of Polish culture, World War II realities, Cold War geopolitics, Marxist socialism, the turbulence of the Second Vatican Council, the history of post-Revolution church-state relations in France, etc.; <br /> <br />3) he adopts a motto of John Paul II's phenomenology and attempts to understand his subjects \\"from the inside,\\" to try to arrive at a sympathetic and experiential depth view of his subject; and <br /> <br />4) he presents the action of the book as a drama that unfolds, as poetic, and as prophetic vision. <br /> <br />A demanding read, not that it is exceedingly obscure or technical but due to the encyclopedic breadth of its narrative and its digressions, it is nonetheless a compelling read, particularly in the initial chapters and through most of the chapters on the pontificate. (The later chapters lose a bit of their edge, largely, one would think, because it becomes most difficult to frame contemporaneous events, absent the perspective that the passage of at least a few years.) The first quarter of the book concerns Karol Wojtyla before his election. This launches the book forward, since he is depicted so distinct and vividly in spiritually heroic and charismatic terms that, although the reader may be very familiar with John Paul II's pontificate, the reader will be pulled forward in the book by the strong desire to see how this man, the \\"Lolek\\" of this book, rises to the challenges of the papacy. <br /> <br />Weigel's writing is at all times respectful of the Pontiff -- he obviously admires John Paul II greatly. Weigel, an orthodox American Catholic, does not shrink from pointing out instances where he believes this papacy has stumbled or failed, such as His Holiness's (at least for the time being) frustrated initiatives to restore unity with the Orthodox Churches. <br /> <br />This biography also points down further avenues for understanding a slice of 20th century history -- works by phenomenologists such as Husserl and Scheler, the writings of Edith Stein, the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and Wojtyla's plays, philosophical treatises, and religious writing. It's always a particular reward when a book points to further areas to explore. <br /> <br />The College of Cardinals elected Wojtyla pope when I was still a teenager. Most of the import of it was lost on me, sadly -- adolescence has its own priorities. Weigel's book allows a chance to view that time through a new lens, to see movement and patterns in current history to which may have been missed the first time around.  <br /> <br />	2005-02-15

Written at about the level of the average Nancy Drew mystery, it is best appreciated at that level. As far as the content, there are howlers on virtually every page (starting with the hero who looks like \\"Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\\" and is a \\"Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard\\" -- good work if you can find it). You have to ignore very pulpy, cheesy writing to enjoy this romantic thriller.<br /><br />Intended as a book that a dedicated reader could finish in a day, or something you take to the beach and casually finish in a weekend, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" makes for a reasonable airline novel, so much so that it is often a bit clunky in its desire to ensure that no intellectual effort on the reader's part will be required. Here's a recurring example in this novel: a bit of unfamiliar terminology, say \\"crux gemmata\\" (jeweled cross) will will be explained on page N, then on page N+1, a character will finger his jeweled cross and explain, \\"Oh, yes -- this is a crux gemmata.\\" I've read dinner menus that were more demanding on the reader. My wife and I both read about a third of it in a day, sharing the same copy, and that's a full work day plus taking care of kids, bedtime, etc. That's also a kind of virtue, I guess -- it's fast and peppy.<br /><br />As far as history goes, Dan Brown apparently thinks that \\"most historians\\" give credence to the forgeries and frauds promoted in hoary best-sellers like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail.\\" This author gets the best of both worlds: simultaneously claiming that \\"it's just fiction,\\" while introducing the novel with claims that the historical record contained within is \\"fact.\\" That claim is ridiculous. To pluck a random example, he spends some time talking about the Council of Nicaea, and incorrectly summarizes it as the origin of the doctrine of Christ's divinity by Constantine. He ignores the Arian controversy out of which it arose, which is like trying to explain the Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I. He ignores the documented fact, agreed upon even by the cheerleaders of the gnostics that he is sympathetic to, that the earliest gnostic doctrines held that Christ was *purely* God, and not really man -- the very reverse of the doctrine that serves as the lynchpin of his novel's intellectual base (such as it is). This is a bad novel for weak or misinformed Christians, but anyone familiar with history should spot the train wreck of Brown's ideas a mile off.<br /><br />Oh yes, and in Brown's world, Opus Dei has shadowy assassin \\"monks\\" (in real life, Opus Dei is not a monastic order -- there are no Opus Dei monks, let alone trained assassins), and the Catholic Church has been promulgating known lies as its central dogmas, promotes violence throughout the world, and has been retarding the progress of science and knowledge for 2 millennia. Brown leaves the reader with the impression that this, too, is a matter of settled historical record. Oh, but then again, it's just fiction. Except when it's not.<br /><br />In general, if you're looking for a heady thriller wrapped around Christian arcana, I'd recommend Umberto Eco's excellent \\"Name of the Rose,\\" not this dumbed down, by-the-numbers novel.Treaty of Versailles without mentioning World War I.

While not all are victories, all highlight the particular genius that the West brings to warfare. Hanson's thesis stands in sharp contrast with Jared Diamond's approach, which emphasizes geography, demographics, and random chance. Rather, says Hanson, uniquely Western cultural institutions (constitutional government, civic militarism, market economies, free inquiry, open dissent, shock battle, individualism) in the long run lead to Western military hegemony, even when, in the short run, Western forces lose battles due to poor leadership, bad decisions, random chance, etc.    Hanson's an excellent writer. He takes war seriously and avoids glamorizing it. He refuses to romanticize non-Westerners he depicts (Persians, Carthaginians, Ottoman Turks, Aztecs, Zulus, Imperial Japanese, Vietnamese), details their frequent prowess, skill, and courage, while resolutely indicating the cultural resources they lacked.    Culture and Carnage starts with the Greco-Persian War, and concludes with the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. There is also a postscript for the second edition that reflects on the recent Islamofascist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the American response. In Hanson's account, the traits that account for Western military success are strikingly similar across thousands of miles and over two millennia. Even given the Al Qaeda attacks, Hanson still believes that the greatest long term threats that the West faces is from . . . . the West: rival Western (or newly Westernized) powers in possession of deadly militaries and practices.    This is an excellent work, lively and strong.	2004-10-29

This is an excellent airline read. Yeah, the prose is a little pulpy and a bit awkward at times, but the story is a structuralist's dream, with a narrative arc that propels the story along. It's the kind of book that you can't pull down, even as you notice that it doesn't have a lot going on below its surface. <br /> <br />There's a lot of things that could be sorted out and explored. We don't know much about the characters other than their surfaces. The entire world of this book has a truncated and fragmented feeling. The text seems unconcerned with a larger world of meaning, giving it an oddly insular feeling. Also, some of the aspects of this ostensible work of nonfiction seem a bit stretched to highten the drama. <br /> <br />And yet, it was a very fun read indeed. <br /> <br />Couldn't help feeling as I was reading that it would make an excellent movie. It would have elements of movies that have been popular, such as Rain Man, Ocean's Eleven, Goodfellas, and Revenge of the Nerds, but there's enough novelty in the premise to keep it fresh. A film could play on a visual level with some of the underdeveloped themes, such as the notion that blackjack functions as a solvent of the identity, that it leads the team to adopt new identities, at one point actually leading them to disguises, professional prosthetics and theatrical makeup. Also, in contrast to some of those movies, this one wouldn't feature self-assured, slick con men played by someone like George Clooney. Rather, this could use the talents more of someone not as \\"Hollywood\\" would could turn in a more nuanced role as an MIT geek who happens to play at being a high roller. (Dean Cain has \\"the look\\" mentioned in the book). <br /> <br />Oddly enough, this doesn't make me want to go to Vegas. The life described seems hollow and disconnected from any meaning. (Also, I feel I'm too old and jaded to go chasing after pots of gold!) However, reading it was a fun way to spend several hours.	2004-08-09

These idioms have come to dominate software development: they are both useful in themselves, and they increasingly form a common language for software designers that is abstracted from details such as implementation language or problem domain. <br /> <br />In order to truly use this book, the developer really needs to incorporate an intuitive knowledge of these patterns, how to implement them, and their relative costs and benefits, into his set of skills. <br /> <br />Some of the simpler patterns are those that occurred to me only after doing things badly in OO designs for years (My first OO experience was in C++ over 10 years ago). Others would not have occurred to me and have saved me heartache in the problems I currently face. <br /> <br />One thing that would be nice would be an update that included Java examples and new patterns.

I can't think of anything that is more important for a Christian or a student of Christianity. We strive to hear the Spirit, but sometimes we disregard the Spirit speaking through Tradition.  <br /> <br />Aquilina's brief, readable book serves as an introduction to the Fathers and how their ideas relate to the great councils of the Church. He follows that foreword with 3 chapters, one for those thinkers who preceded the Council of Nicaea, those who were contemporaneous, and those who followed it. For each Father, Aquilina gives a well-researched biographical sketch, followed by a representive piece of that Father's writing. It's a nice blend of commentary and tract, context and text. The author's prose is sharp, direct, concise and unobtrusive, the selections well-chosen. The result is an eminently readable book that leaves you wanting to drink more deeply at the Patristic well.	2004-07-24

First, here's our situation: we have a son who is 5 years old. We limit his TV (by not having one), and we read to him incessantly. He really loves books. He clearly has an aptitude for reading. About 8 months ago, I bought this book. At that point, he was attempting to read on his own. He would do fine usually, but often, he would just guess something that wasn't even close -- it was clear he had some words memorized, but with other he looked at how it began and ended, then just guessed a word.<br />While this book may not exactly be turnkey (it took a tiny bit of adaptation to make it work), he started looking forward to impromptu lessons. Within a couple weeks, the difference in his approach was noticeable -- there was a marked improvement. He is starting kindergarten in the fall, and our best guess is that he is now reading somewhere between a second and a third grade level. The bottom line is that this book really works.	2004-07-11

This is one of the texts that drove that trend. Fortunately, its tone is not polemical in the slightest. MacIntyre's argument is measured and well-reasoned, and he gives several useful concepts for addressing moral issues, e.g., institutional *practices* that provide internal rather than external goods, and narratives and stories as constitutive of human existence.<br />It's an involved argument, and at least partly relies upon a reading of intellectual history for its strength. For MacIntyre, upon investigation there are only two consistent moral viewpoints: one associated with Aristotle that views morality as objectively valid and rational because it's based on a natural teleology and sees that morality exercised through the development of virtues and intricately entwined with them, another, based upon Nietsche, which sees morality only as a mask for irrational power.<br />Lucid and well-written. Highly recommended.	2004-01-01

For Chesterton, true, vigorous Christianity is simultaneously incarnational (embodied) and spiritual, historical and eternal. <br />This book also displays Chesterton as a clever stylist with a penchant for aphorism and the unexpected turn of phrase. His wit and clarity are a model for English prose.	2003-11-01

Frum is insightful and evenhanded -- Republicans and Democratic politicians alike are critiqued. What surprised me about the book wasn't how shrewd Frum was, it was what a delightful read the book was. This is not preaching to the conservative faithful, like, say Ann Coulter's &quot;Slander.&quot; He's closer to David Brooks in temperament -- funny, compassionate, and unfailingly observant.

It's a great, engaging read. <br />In 1993, US soldiers, enforcing UN mandates, sought to remove Somali warlord Aidid to aid relief efforts and establish a more democratic government. One autumn day, a Special Forces raid to seize two of Aidid's lieutenants ended with 18 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of Somali's dead. Mark Bowden examines the various things that went wrong, and avoids blaming the obvious suspects (the commanding general, the Secretary of Defense, the President). Indeed, as Bowden presents it, if the men who fought there had regrets about command, it was not that the casualty-ridden raid was ordered. Rather, it's that the policy that it served was abruptly changed immediately after, making the success of the mission moot.<br />Bowden has a nice style, very straight but very readable. He's not interesting in larger political points but seeks to tell a story and let the world know the bravery of some hundred-odd American soldiers. He's got a great way with detail, weaving it into his stories without overwhelming them. I'm looking forward to whatever topic he grabs next.	2003-01-24

If you're not Catholic or Christian and wish to encounter the most persuasive apologetics, this is an excellent place to start.<br />Chesterton is a wonderful writer. A poet by nature, Chesterton focuses on the material and concrete in ways that seems both paradoxical and wondrous. In &quot;Saint Francis of Assisi,&quot; Chesterton takes the most popular saint, and presents all those details that really make us modern secularists most uncomfortable with him. In another book here, he links St. Thomas Aquinas to Francis, showing that, despite their vast differences in temperament, they both strove to save and present the goodness of creation and nature and to rebuke (in word or action) those who would hold the bodily in disdain.<br />In a sense, the biographies here are more than biographies. They're filled with diversions, and those diversions all point in the direction of the remaining book, &quot;The Everlasting Man,&quot; which is presented between the other two. The central point here is that the Incarnation is the central event of human history; it allows us to joyously celebrate the good of creation and nature, as God has blessed matter with His very being.<br />Also, Chesterton is a real pleasure to read, as this passage shows: &quot;One of my first journalistic adventures, or misadventures, concerned a comment on Grant Allen, who had written a book about the Evolution of the Idea of God. I happened to remark that it would be much more interesting if God wrote a book about the evolution of the idea of Grant Allen.&quot; <br />His wit shines in the conclusion of this anecdote. To his bemusement, his editor castigates *him* for being blasphemous. &quot;In that hour I learned many things, including the fact that there is something purely acoustic in much of that agnostic sort of reverence. The editor had not seen the point, because in the title of the book thelong word came at the beginning and the short word at the end; whereas in my comments the short word came at the beginning and gave him a sort of shock. I have noticed that if you put a word like God into the same sentence with a word like dog, these abrupt and angular words affect people like pistol-shots. Whether you say that God made the dog or the dog made God does not seem to matter; that is only one of the sterile disputations of the too subtle theologians. But so long as you begin with a long word like evolution the rest will roll harmlessly past; very probably the editor had not read the whole of the title, for it is rather a long title and he was rather a busy man.&quot;	2003-01-14

This thin book is a great place to get some great common sense -- e.g., that it's futile to assume that if you just spend enough time in &quot;design phase&quot; that the software project will go better. Very practically, every successful project I've worked on has had architects that coded, has had continuous integration and testing, lots of developer communication and cooperation, and strove always to maintain short development cycles with lots of customer feedback. <br />Beck's book is direct, straightforward and undogmatic.

He's gives us a feeling for the incredible flux this area has seen over the past 2000 years. Lewis has a good eye for evocative detail, using an quotidian coffeehouse example at the outset to delineate elements of culture which he then uses as a springboard for Middle Eastern history.<br />Unlike many one-volume histories, Lewis then gives an excellent background, starting in pre-Christian antiquity and the Persian empire and continuing during the Christian period. He has an appreciation for the prominent achievements of Islam and the Ottoman Empire and writes with praiseworthy restaint when considering the causes of the decline of the Empire. Those seeking more recent history may be disappointed and might consider other histories in addition to this one.<br />Lewis has a good style with history, plucking out a narrative but not neglecting fact. It's a popular, not scholarly work, a thoroughly enjoyable read. Strongly recommended.	2002-10-18

D.) to semiotics, philosophy, and religion, we remember Percy for his slightly cantankerous (but never malicious) outlook on modernity and the human condition.<br />&quot;Love in the Ruins,&quot; written in '71, imagines a U.S.A. in which prevalent (and sometimes contradictory) trends run to their illogical extremes -- political association becomes fragmented to the point of neo-tribalism, mainline churches become secularized to the point of banality or fixated to the point of intolerance, and psychological treatment grows increasing manipulative. Into this world he drops Dr. Tom More, &quot;bad Catholic&quot; and the inventor of the Ontological Lapsometer. The Lapsometer measures the degree to which a soul has fallen, the degree of estrangement and alienation it has attained. One particular sickness it detects is angelism/bestialism -- the tendency to go from spirit-like abstraction to animal appetite with little moderation. Like all technologies, the Lapsometer becomes a means of social and spiritual manipulation, and Dr. More and his device set in play a story that leads the world to the brink of apocalypse. <br />By turns desperate and hilarious, this readable novel holds up well today.

I used two certification books: this one and Khalid Mughal's book. I started with Mughal's book, finishing it, then taking his sample test. I then realized that it didn't handle the most recent version of the test. That meant that it covered a bunch of AWT and Swing stuff (no longer on the test, and of little interest to me as a server-side developer), and it didn't cover assertions. So I plunked down some cash on this book, because it was advertised to cover J2SE 1.4. <br />Unfortunately, this book was rushed into production, so all the test materials on the CD are actually for the old version! While the book covers the new material fairly well (and, truth be told, it's only a matter of not studying the GUI stuff and reading 3 additional pages on assertions), one of the main reasons you buy a book like this is to set up conditions as nearly approximating the actual test as possible. That loses the book one star. In addition, I need a good list of errata, and it seemed liked the Sybex Web site for this could use more attention and organization. For instance, there was an apology up on the site for the CD not being up to date, but there was no new version of the CD material that covered the defects. That loses a second star.<br />My belief is that this book will allow you to get the certification if you study for it, but I'm disappointed at the lack of quality for a product that is supposed to support a key part of a Java programmer's career and livelihood.	2002-09-24

Cervantes, however, was imprisoned for several years by the Moors. <br />Reading Don Quixote this past winter, I was struck by how that experience is woven through Don Quixote. Part novel, part collection of tales, Don Quixote's world is one of flux and change. This world is the setting for many quests: Moors seeking true love and acceptance in Spain, enslaved Spaniards yearning for freedom, Don Quixote striving to disenchant his Dulcinea, and Sancho Panza looking for an island to govern.<br />Is the world being enchanted or drained of magic? Both readings are plausible. Don Quixote distrusts appearances, and we can't tell if he's genius or fool for doing so.<br />If this sounds highfalutin, let me add that this novel includes great slapstick that made me put down the book and laugh out loud. While there are some slow passages (maybe an abridgement would be best to read), they can be gotten through with a little effort. The best passages are priceless.	2002-06-03

Like many in America today, I find myself a product of an unfinished education, with a sense of being flung into a history I don't quite grasp. I do my best to remedy my inadequacies, and a novel like this is an excellent tonic for them.<br />A classic 20th century novel of ideas, there's so much to mull over here: the nature of time, notions of progress and regress in history, the body and illness, psychoanalysis and spiritualism. <br />Unlike his contemporaries Joyce and Faulkner, Mann doesn't give us radical experiments in narrative form. This is fairly straightforward and readable. The only bit of cleverness is Mann's telescoping of narrative and chronological time: 1 week can take a hundred pages, while a few years can be covered in twenty. However, as Mann writes at the outset, only the exhaustive is truly interesting, and Mann seeks to be fascinating throughout the 700 pages.<br />Mann has a sense of humor and a sense of tragedy, and both shine here, with adults wrapped up like babies, medical X-ray photos as sensual mementos, multiple breakfasts, and grief as fetish. Despite the ironic and frequent declarations of the hero Hans Castorp's \\"mediocrity,\\" by the end, Mann elicits from us genuine and deep sympathy for him.	2002-01-02

They also speak plainly about the sad state of architectural culture today. Their belief in the power of good design and planning to right all social ills probably needs to be taken with a grain of salt, but if they overstate their case, that is perhaps better than understating it. Certainly bad planning and design can have disastrous effects, as anyone stranded in a strip mall can attest.<br />My only complaints is that the photo inserts are much too small for a topic that is so visual in nature, and that Duany et al. tend to be somewhat self-congratulatory in their tone.	2001-08-09

This last book ends as a preachy muddle, and most of the promised climaxes turn out to be anti-climaxes (the foreshadowed betrayal, the end of the Authority, etc.) As radical as Pullman fancies himself, this work also seems to keep trying to reconcile its anti-Christian impulses with Christian morality (dying to self for others, the value of truth, the gifts of the body and physicality). Pullman fashions a straw man of Christianity that actually much more resembles various Christian heresies such as Manichaeism or gnosticism, all the while espousing some of their tenets. For someone who has vocally criticised C. S. Lewis for a tendency to sermonize, Pullman surprising falls to the same temptation, blunting his craftsmanship in this final book of the trilogy.	2001-04-25

The world of \\"Golden Compass\\" is vividly imagined, and Pullman's devices (daemons, anbaric energy, zeppelins, etc.) all work to firmly place the reader in a specific setting. The plotting and diction are tight everywhere, and the second part of the trilogy has even better pacing. <br /> Pullman is obsessed with a Manichaean/gnostic view of the world and of spirit, and with every successive book in the series, he advocates it more firmly and explicitly. In fact, his obsession distinctly weakens his craftsmanship in the third book.	2001-04-16

It's a great read, and an apt view of a society trying hard to reconcile Romantic/bohemian ideals of radical individualism with classical conservative/bourgeois ideals of social stability. It is reminiscent of Paul Fussell's '80's book on social class in America, &quot;Class,&quot; although Brooks has a lot more affection for his subject and is far less acerbic (and a lot less self-serving, too).<br />Anecdotes about the Arizona Power Exchange (&quot;APEX&quot;) and &quot;Flexidoxy&quot; are striking and funny. APEX is a support organization for sado-masochism, once considered a bohemian topic, that manages to make S&amp;M seem about as safe, boring, and, well, bourgeois as the Rotary Club. &quot;Flexidoxy&quot; is a coinage which describes a religious approach that is conservatively fastidious about the details of traditional religious worship, liturgy, dietary restrictions, etc., but allows the believer to pick and choose moral issues and doctrines. Details like these, and Brooks's brisk, smart style give the book its charm. Highly recommended.	2001-04-10

The more conversations that I have with college students, the more I realize that the assumptions that he attacks here are only growing stronger and more entrenched in the places where culture is formed. He's got a good view of how the human becomes inhuman. In the last 50 years, Western cultural institutions more and more openly speak of humans as objects that can be manipulated with impunity. This is a must-read.	2000-11-27

Bob Zmuda's book is a fun read, but it does give short shrift to Kaufman's formative years. (On the other hand, Zehme's account seems more speculative and given to fancy.) For being Kaufman's &quot;best friend and writer,&quot; Zmuda seems somewhat distanced from his subject, which may be the way Kaufman wanted it. Andy is a fascinating subject. Perhaps he would be best served by a video anthology of his work on video.	2000-11-27

This number is freely available, Cornwell must have  known it well: about 5,000. As this would have undercut his thesis (that the diplomacy of Pius XII clearly was only self-serving  and did not save lives), he assiduously keeps it from the reader. The book  is rife with these sorts of distortions.<br />First, contrary to Cornwell's  assertions, there is precious little new material, and he did not enjoy  &quot;unprecendented&quot; access to Vatican archives. Second, his  assertion that he started the project with the intention of clearing the  name Eugenio Pacelli (Pius XII) is highly suspect, since by his own  admission, his main point is that the papacy is itself an evil institution;  it's unlikely that the reign of one man would have changed his mind on  this, especially given the REALLY bad popes of history. If he really felt  the papacy was an unreformable evil, what would be his motivation to clear  the name of a pope who exercised such clear authority? Third, nothing is  mentioned of Pacelli's support of Christian Democrat parties after the war,  as this would undercut Cornwell image of a pope who distrusted democratic  movements.<br />Structurally, the book is a mess. Is it a biography of  Pacelli? Not really. Is it a story of the wartime behavior of Pius XII?  About one-third of it is, but that is better covered by authors who focused  on original sources, e.g., Pierre Blet, and not secondary and tertiary  sources as Cornwell does. He takes the opportunity to tell us what he  thinks about John Paul II (against, natch) and contraception (for, natch),  all the while showing that, his claim to be a &quot;devout Catholic&quot;  notwithstanding, he's clearly out of touch with both Catholic theology and  Catholic life as practiced today. He's hilariously uninformed about NFP(no, I have no idea what this has to do with the Nazis or Pius, either),  and only someone who's never read or understood John Paul II's  philosophical work could call his work &quot;a narrow reading of  neo-Thomist philosophy,&quot; unless neo-Thomist philosophy somehow now  includes 20th century phenomenology.<br />The book is also filled with fun,  irrelevant, &quot;zany&quot; tidbits like what Orson Welles and Alec  Guinness recalled of their meetings with the pontiff. Oh, and in case you  missed it (most historians have), the Vatican was also responsible for  World War I (p. 48-58)!  Who writes this stuff?	2000-05-10

My friend Kris accused me of that when he read this book at my urging years ago. Apparently, all the existential insinuations struck him as much ado about nothing. For my part, I found this one of the  funniest books I've ever read. In the age of Jerry Springer, the lampoon of  Phil Donahue seems, if anything, tame. He takes the central modern  question, &quot;What does it mean to be ME?&quot; and spins it into a  satirical obsession. (For what it's worth, Kris aside, all my other friends  have loved it, too.)	2000-03-17

Lewis, is a great starting  point for further research, both scientific and philosophical.	1999-11-03
