Sure, some of it sounds corny to her Ivy League educated ear, but much of it is needed and a valuable comfort and inspiration to those born without her advantages who need it.  She spends a lot of ink making snide comments about those in the job-hunting world whom she considers her intellectual inferiors -- going after one recruiter for the dangling participle in his brochure.  A real job-seeker, someone who needs the money, would ignore this and seriously try to become employed.  Ms. Ehrenreich does not, not once, and that fatal flaw of approach torpedoes the book and makes it just a trivial exercise in snobbery.  This is a really ugly book, not because of the subjects she writes about or her prose, but because of the insight it gives into her coarse soul and sneering outlook on the world.<br />America has been for many years and remains the greatest source of new and rewarding jobs on the planet.  Much of that job creation inevitably inovolves the \\"creative desctruction\\" of capitalism (i.e., the buggy whip industry went under and almost all the blacksmiths have disappeared, but other jobs in new industries sprang up to take their places).  Ms. Ehrenreich has absolutely no knowledge of economics or how the real job market works.  She is wholly unqualifed to write this book or her previous one.	2005-09-14

As someone who served as a U.S. Army lieutenant in Vietnam (June 1968-June 1969), I am an eager buyer of any book about similar experiences, especially those by writers as good as Tracy Kidder.  This book is interesting, well-written, and psychologically and historically accurate in most ways.  You will enjoy it even if you have no direct experience of Vietnam or the war America fought there and don't know a REMF from a grunt wearing a CIB (all terms explained in the book).  The author does not spare himself (giving us chunks of his wince-making adolescent novel written immediately after his return) and can be searingly honest about some of his experiences, such as those with the prostitutes in Singapore on his R&R and his description of the NVA's dominance of the war and its Cambodian sanctuaries, which are likely to get him tarred and feathered in the circles in which he hangs out in Northampton and Cambridge.  There is a particularly interesting interplay between his Harvard (1963-67) and Army (1967-69) experiences which can be summarized as the Army seen through the lens of his Harvard education and acculturation.  (I had the opposite perspective, doing the Army first and then Harvard Law School -- which is quite different from the Adams House/final club Harvard undergrad -- in 1969-72, and the contrast was very instructive).  The only hesitation I have about this book is that there is a little bit too much navel-gazing and teasing of the reader (starting with the deliberately ambiguous title) which comes across as over-cleverness at times.  Kidder also drops all these references to The Great Gatsby throughout the text, one of the first American novels to employ the device of the less than fully honest narrator, which after a while raises the reader's suspicion level and detracts from the book, as after a while it occasionally feels like a hall of mirrors.  Still, it was an enjoyable read and beautifully well-written like all Kidder's books, and I found nothingin it that was dishonest and much that was honest and brought back memories of my own service, some painful and some which make you laugh out loud (yes, there is laughter in war zones -- lots of it, to relieve the tension).  The only better book I know in this genre is In Pharoah's Army by Tobias Wolff, which has a more straightforward and serious tone than this excellent book.  Highest possible recommendation.	2005-09-08

Kevin is de trop.  No one is that unidimensional.  Author tries to soften the cardboard characterization by a few scenes in which Kevin is nice, but they don't fly.  As a result, he is a cariacature. <br />2.  Book is 1/3 too long, could have been edited down in length without losing anything and would be improved by some judicious pruning. <br />3.  Overwritten; author is in love with her own voice at the expense of characterization. <br />4.  Vapid liberalism (snotty asides about Republicans, gun control, etc. pervade this book) are gratuitous and subtract much from the work. <br />I would buy the author's next book in the hope that her style will have matured as a result of having written this good, but flawed, novel.	2005-08-31

Pretentious, snobbish \\"nothing west of the Hudson exists,\\" poorly plotted and lamely executed novel.  Too bad; the idea could have made for an interesting book if better executed.  Could have.  The author thinks it's fun to describe the main character as having a copy of The New Yorker in her apartment.  Actually a \\"dog-eared copy of The New Yorker\\".  Actually a \\"multiply dog-eared copy of The New Yorker\\".  This is what passes for characterization these days?  Author also enjoys sneering at \\"white trash,\\" all forms of makeup (though she then complains about the plain appearance of her university colleagues), Vietnam veterans, and \\"paperbacks with raised, glitzy type some obvious connection to TV or the movies\\" which people read on airplanes.  What she doesn't realize is that thrityish frustrated English instructors who eat Thai in the Village, vaguely wish they could work for Medecines sans Frontieres (though they have no medical degrees and can't even drive a jeep) and keep multiply dog-eared copies of The New Yorker in their apartments are just as uninteresting as those whose life is defined by Jimmy Choo and Prada.  Full of incredibly snotty passages; the main character, Vera, gets a letter with \\"a 'Love' stamp, Vera's second least favorite, after the flag\\" and summons up \\"every last scrap of her working class work ethic\\". \\"Manhattanite that she was, the idea of boarding a train to Jersey was, well, mortifying.\\"  Nor does Vera like going to the post office where \\"a single semiconscious worder tended to long queues of the underclass in need of money orders and one stamp.\\"  (Vera is a CitiBanker).  This stuff gets old fast, very fast.  Anyway, who among us is still interested in the whines and tribulations of college English instructors unless their story is far more brilliantly executed than this?  Avoid at all costs.

This is the ultimate \\"apologia pro vita Clinton,\\" and never rises above the softball questions lobbed at him by the Washington press corps, of which the author (Washington Post staffer) is a member in good standing.  Author spends many pages trying to build up Clinton's few accomplishments and many more trying to soft-pedal his many immoral and evil acts which trashed the office of the President (see his ever-so-light treatment of Denise Rich and Pardongate).  Here's an admitted perjurer who could not even represent you in traffic court in Little Rock since he's been disbarred, and the author has nothing really bad to say about him.  Coverage of impeachment is particularly skimpy and misleading -- the author can't wait to rush through it and hopes you'll avert your eyes too.  It's amazing how low the office of the presidency was brought by this flim-flam man, but the author misses the point entirely.  \\"First in his Class\\" is much better.	2005-07-11

The author claims credentials to write about the war, but never got closer to combat than sitting in a bar in Saigon listening to war stories from real soldiers.  As a REMF, he has no way of telling which are true and which are false, but chooses to believe only the ones that cast discredit on America.  His year in-country was spent inside a sanitzed bubble and he learned nothing from it.  He swallows whole every NPR/CBS/SDS/anti-American cliche about the war and automatically rejects anything the government has to say.  He repeats all the tired (and demonstrably false) lies about Agent Orange, suicide rates among Vietnam veterans, thw \\"working class war\\" myth, etc.  Anecdotes = research for him, and he believes anything the Vietnames government told him in 2001 and disbelieves every contrary pience of evidence.  Where are the boat people?  Where are the three million dead Cambodians, victims of the Khmer Rouge?  Where is balance and objectivity?  Not in this book.  In addition, this book is very poorly written and terminally boring (who cares when the author quit smoking?).  How this thing ever found a publisher is a great mystery.  Full disclosure:  I am embarassed to admit that I was three years ahead of the author at Trinity College and in the same fraternity.  My experience in Vietnam was very positive, and most veterans are very proud to have served.  Do not under any circumstances buy this rubbish.	2005-05-19

Avoid and buy Ming Tan's How to Attract Asian Women instead -- a book written buy a sensitive and understanding Asian woman, filled with quotes from real Asian women, much better than this.

This is the best book I have yet read on the entire history of the Khmer Rouge years.  It is more (fortunately) than a biography of Pol Pot -- it is just as much a history of Cambodia and and examination of its peoples' character, and shorter biographies of other prominent Khmer figures, especially King Sihanouk.  The author scrupulously avoids the oversimplifications and falso moralizing of most books about Cambodia -- the ones that say either (1) the Khmer Rouge were entirely America's fault, (2) entirely Nixon's fault, or (3) entirely Kissinger's fault -- choose one.  He carefully explores, among other things, American policy toward and conduct in Cambodia in the period leading up to 1975 in a thorough and neutral manner, with interesting suggestions on the significance of this and many other topics.  In addition, the author's style is fluid and transparent, and he has done his homework.  This is the best book about Cambodia I have ever read, and I have read all the ones I have been able to lay my hands on.  Buy it even if you think you have no interest in the subject, or know it too well already -- you will be pleasantly surprised and will enjoy the book immensely.	2005-02-15

One example, of many, is the treatment of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.  In this book there is NO analysis (or even a recounting!) whatsoever of the group's charges against Kerry, none of which have been \\"discredited\\" at any time by anyone, and several of which forced Kerry to retract his earlier baseless boasts, just an attempt to smear SBVT and talk about their effect on the polls.  Another interesting contrast is the highly contrasting treatment of Kerry's various campaign managers (sincere, agonized heroes) and Karl Rove (Darth Vader, if you buy the books's spin).  The entire book is cluttered with a lot of little \\"gotcha\\" trivial and meaningless anecdotes, especially those favorable to the Kerry camp and unfavorable to the Bush camp, which add nothing to the story.  This book is evidence of the sad degeneration of Newsweek and this election special; we've come a long way, in the wrong direction, from \\"The Making of the President\\" by Teddy White 40 years ago.	2005-02-02

The first is the selection of topics from the Encyclopedia Britannica, which is interesting, skillfully done, and very enjoyable to read, which gets 5 stars.  The selection allows the reader to avoid reading the whole EB as the author has done, and for this we should be grateful. <br />However, the other part of this book is the author's navel-gazing and cutesy comments on his terminally uninteresting personal life, which gets zero stars.  It is difficult to believe this book was written by a 35-year-old; it reads more like a 14-year-old's immature snickering.  The author is a product of both the Dalton School and Brown University; if you know either of these institutions, you will already know the flavor and flaws of this part of the book.  The author complains at length about his earlier career writing about movie stars, but his chapters on his current life and interests only go to prove the validity of the Peter Principle in action.

Very well done, and the best of its genre (\\"I was there as a journalist, and here is the inside scoop and how I REALLY felt about it...\\").  But: <br />1.  A bit too much navel-gazing by the author, which is unresolved.  Am I a journalist doing good for the world, or just a third-world country death junkie?  This is a tension reported by many journos, but at the very least it should be resolved. <br />2.  Unresolved attitude toward military (especially American).  Hates them for shooting and any military virtues, but when the shooting is aimed at the author he wants MedEvac and hospital care from the soldiers RIGHT NOW, like a whiny six-year-old.  Another unresolved conflict. <br />Those things being said, this is still a terrific read.  The historical bits about Mr. Davey are better than the author's personal reminiscences, but both are excellent.  I have never been much interested in Africa where the contemporary part of this book is set, but was fascinated by the author's accounts of life there. <br />My credentials for writing this review:  (1) Also born overseas to English/American parents, similar to the author's background,(2) Columbia Journalism School, '66, and experience as a reporter (though not a foreign correspondent), (3) US Army service in Vietnam in 1966-69 and civilian charity work in Cambodia in 1995-2000, with lots of opportunity to observe journos at work in those environments.	2004-10-04

I live in Augusta, rent my house out during Masters Week, but don't play golf or belong to Augusta National.  This book is well-written and fascinating, with a few flaws.  The author tries to cover a lot of stories in one book:  the sport of golf generally, Augusta National, the Masters, Hootie Johnson, Martha Burk, press coverage of the controversy (including the subsequent implosion of the New York Times), and the community of Augusta.  The first six are well done (except he gives Martha Burk a pass -- she has some amazingly radical ideas and positions he did not cover) and is far too kind to her.  (She vanished completely at the 2004 Masters, which he does not mention).  The last topic fails miserably.  The author does not understand the South or Southern hospitality.  He is shocked that we have an old Confederate monument on Broad Street downtown.  Well, show me a town in the South that doesn't!  No one here, black or white, gets very excited about it and hasn't for decades.  He does not understand (or make an effort to understand) the connections a Federal judge would legitimately have with the local community in a small town.  He neglects the local angle to the story and distorts what he does not neglect.  The book is full of careless editorial errors -- in one sentence he refers to Fort Dixon in New Jersey (which is actually Fort Dix) and Fort Devin Massachusets (Fort Devens), errors he could have corrected with minimal care, then jumps all over other writers for confusing Augusta National and Augusta Country Club.  This kind of thing makes one wonder about the accuracy of the rest of the book, in the areas which I am not so familiar with.  Overall a good read, and reasonably balanced.	2004-06-05

This is an especially brilliant thing to have done given that the case was almost 25 years old before the author really started digging into it.  He makes the people, the place, and the spirit come alive through his terrific writing.  I got hooked in the first short paragraph:  &quot;No one forgets his first foreign country.  The light, the architecture, the way they do their eggs.  Red money.  The dreamy disorientation.  The smell of aviation fuel.&quot;  This is wonderful writing at its best.

Several years ago the National Lampoon did a satire on how to write a novel, recommending that if you wrote your characters into a blind alley with no way forward, you should just end your book by saying \\"Suddenly, he was run over by a bus\\".  The author seems to have taken that advice, not realizing it was satire.  This is a book that has no ending, but just stops.  Waste of money; avoid.	2004-05-17

It is still puzzling why the author attempts to put two disconnected stories together.  They have little in common but the date on which they occurred, and sometimes the author's attempt to connect them does not work.<BR>This book slowly but surely makes you realize the huge contrast between those who served and those who ducked.  On the battlefield, we read of heroism, self-sacrifice, courage and endurance in the fact of overwhelming horror and danger.  On campus, we read of some pouting little sandbox controversies --missing class, mimes capering at a demonstration, etc.  The author points out that 58 men lost their lives on the battlefield, while at the demonstration the worst anyone got was a superficial scalp wound -- trivial in contrast.  Lives were shattered, and cut short, in the Army, but barely interrupted for more than a weekend in Madison.  I'm not sure the author intended this result, but the sickening contrast gets stronger and stronger as the book progresses.  The author also points out that Vietnam veterans (like myself) feel closer to our battlefield enemies (as recounted during a 2002 trip to Vietnam described at the end of the book) than we ever will to the protestors.  There are chilling quotes from official North Vietnamese documents about how their determination was strengthened by the \\"antiwar\\" movement (I never could figure out how it was \\"antiwar\\" to chant, as the protestors did, \\"Ho, Ho, Ho CHii Minh!  The NLF [Viet Cong] is going to win!\\" -- sounds more like rooting for the other side to me -- while their contemporaries were dying on the battlefield.)<BR>One of the finest books I have read on the Vietnam war.  It will make you think.  And it is an accurate rendition of what Vietnam was like in 1967; take it from one who was there during that year.	2003-09-27

The &quot;Weathermen&quot; were spoiled, dangerous brats, who fortunately never got more than miniscule attention and support.  When others didn't adopt their agenda upon its announcement, they went violent and started bombing without regard to the consequences.  The author uses lots of cheap tricks to try to make them suitable protagonists.  One is to announce, repeatedly, that anyone who got violent was automatically expelled from the Weatherman the second he or she did so -- never mind that they instigated it all.  Then there's the guilty revolutionary who sends money anonymmously to her victim's family (never happened), and another who is sugar-coated as the world's best parent to try to gin up some faux sympathy.  Every 20 pages or so the author shoves a political tract in your face by having the journalist character make a political speech about how the Weathermen were really just premature ecologists (which they never cared about) and the violence was excusable...<BR>This is a trendy left political pamphlet disguised (thinly) as fiction.  (The author likes to weave back and forth between real characters and his fictional ones).  It is a revolting attempt to rewrite history and is not good fiction either.  A repellent, immoral, and trivial book about people cut from the same cloth.	2003-07-25

Ms. Shapiro can write decent prose which moves along, but everything else about this vapid story is terrible, just terrible. The characters are flat, one-dimensional nobodies. The two main ones, the parents, are nothing more than overgrown children themselves, playing at being grown-ups into their forties, still dependent on their own parents for financial and emotional sustenance, oddly passive as their family crumbles. They just need to grow up, not have a novel written about them -- they are too tepid to sustain its weight. There is nothing interesting about them; they are cardboard figures whom the author moves about the landscape without any interior motivation at all. They never discipline their child and then wonder why she goes off the rails. The mother keeps whining over and over again that she loves her children (though this is stated, rather than shown, as it would be in a good novel), so why are they turning out so terribly wrong, and are the other competitive Yuppie moms looking down on her as a result? One rapidly gets the impression that this woman would be equally concerned about a scratch in her Volvo. The main characters are the kind of people who live in a quaint Massachusetts village, but boycott the stores that spring up to serve them, and whose best friends are a noveau-riche couple -- he, a restaurant critic, she a partner at a \\"small, but prestigious, Boiston law firm\\". Oh, please. This thing reads like a parody of Yuppie life, but I am not entirely sure the author is actually that self-aware. Finally, this is one of those books that just stops...doesn't really have an ending, other than a deus ex machina effort to wrap things up which is not plausible and does not work.  Avoid.	2003-04-20

The author grotesquely over-interprets and old photograph and just goes on and on and on about it long after its significance has been wrung dry.  Contains sentences like, &quot;In Mississippi everything had changed, but nothing had changed.&quot;  How profound.  Rambles on about the children and grandchildren of those in the photo to no apparent purpose.  A favorite liberal Northerners' critique of poor Southern whites is that they clung to their slightly elevated rung on the social status ladder by putting down blacks and saying, &quot;Well, at least I'm not Black.&quot;  The author clings to his identity by putting down all the Southerners he meets and saying, &quot;Well, at least I'm not a racist&quot; without the slightest sense of irony or self-awareness.

Compare and contrast the author's treatments of two incidents during the war.  (1) the deliberate planned massacre in Hue during the Tet Offensive of about 5,000 innocent civilians by the VC and NVA (as this was done according to official policy, no one has ever been called to account for it).  The author brushes this off as essentially bad for public relations for the VC/NVA.  (2)  The My Lai massacre of several hundred innocent Vietnamese civilians, an unusual aberration, contrary to strict US rules of engagement, for which many of the guilty were tried and punished for war crimes.  Sheehan raves on and on about this and tries to tar the whole US involvement in Vietnam with it.  This is just one example among dozens of examples of biased, inaccurate reporting in this trashy book.  From one who knows as I served there in 1968-69.

It's hard to sustain tone and reader interest through 894 pages, but Littell pulls it off with amazing grace.  A 50-year tour d'horizon of the CIA and those who toil in its vineyards.  Littell is a terrific author with some great books (starting with The Defection of A.J. Lewinter, still his best) and a few mediocre ones along the way.  This one is his longest and most ambitious work and he pulls it off in a masterful fashion.  I don't usually like books this long, but found myself wishing this one were longer so I could keep reading.  It adds a dimension if you are a spy or spy novel fan and know a lot about the CIA and American history since 1945, but even if you don't have that background this is a terrific read.  Great stuff.

You get lost in this book and find yourself looking up after 10 pages or so realizing, with a jolt, that the characters aren't real and you are just reading a book.

The Sergeant Major commented that the \\"whiners and losers\\" who make up a tiny minority of Vietnam veterans have come to be more and more discredited with each passing year, and that their grandchildren would read the real history of Vietnam written by other, braver men.  This would have been a very good place for this book to stop.  It is a lengthy, self-absorbed, navel-gazing moan from a guy who didn't have a particularly tough (or interesting) tour of duty.  I was there too (June 1968-June 1969) and it wasn't anything like what this book claims.  Ketwig enlisted (not drafted), volunteered for OCS, etc. and then found adjustment to military life painful and discovered he was not up to the task.  It was easy in those days to turn on the military and betray your buddies to get attention and popularity.  So here is the less-than-compelling saga of a not very interesting motor mechanic's tour in Nam and dull life afterward.  If you are interested in what company clerks, chaplain's assistants and REMFs thought about the war, I suppose you could read this.  Infinitely better are In Pharoah's Army, by Tobia Wolfe; The Names of the Dead, by Stewart O'Nan; After Tet, by Ronald Spector; and Stolen Valor, by J.G. Burkett.

He is able to write about the American South without being either snide or condescending, something native American writers are constitutionally incapable of doing....  Chapman is a refreshing change of pace from these apparatchiks, who actually listens to and learns something from some fundamentalist Christians (I am not one).  Chapman is a fluent, graceful writer and never lets the reader's interest flag.  I almost deducted half a star for his knee-jerk anti-capitalism (this from a man who makes a million dollars a year!) and occasional descent into navel-gazing, but the book transcends those minor lapses.  I found this particularly interesting because my father was British and I grew up in part in England, and because I live, by choice, in the South not 100 miles from Dayton, so this book explored my past and my present environment of choice.

This guy spent less than 12 months in Mississippi and is now a self-proclaimed expert on life there.  He came into town with lots of preconceptions and didn't lose a single one.  On one of his first days in town as the new sports editor, he drives to a private school and decides that because it might have been a seg academy in the 1960's (this is 1988), the school will get next to no coverage on \\"my sports page\\".  This without ever getting out of the car!  He is also weirdly hung up on Emmett Till, which is like going to New York City and thinking everyone reminds you of Jimmy Walker.  If you write about the South, you have to tear it down (Rick Bragg, Willie Morris, etc.) or you don't get published -- same story here.  Most tellingly, the author gets a lot of Southern hospitality (even from people who can't afford to eat themselves) which he accepts as his due as the Shining Stranger from Afar.  He never repays any of it (or if he does, he doesn't write about it), demonstrating that he has learned nothing from his experience.

The author very subtly skewers these L.L. Bean-wearing ur-Yuppies and exposes their foolish sense of entitlement with a scalpel.  Example:  Happy Faces day care in the book has a \\"winter solistice celebration\\" and you realize all the characters would die, just die, of mortification with something as declasse as a Christmas party.  Great book; please write some more!	2002-07-26

Central character is a cardboard cutout, dull man, with trivial problems.  His family is the only thing less interesting than he is in the book.  And the plot is even worse...weird without being in the least bit interesting.  The whole time warp/dual identity/meditation on Civil War never comes close to liftoff.  The author has some minor talent for dialogue and description but smothers the few decent passages by overwriting everything.  I could not finish it.  Gave up after 150 pages and left it in a motel room and went for a walk through downtown Columbus, Georgia instead of reading another word, which should give you some idea of what a dud this is if you have ever been there.	2002-07-16

This is the only disease that is not reportable or investigatable by public health officials.  Why?  Special interest group pressure by the homosexuals.  This is the most politicized disease ever to afflict mankind.  What people are trying to scare you with doesn't exist.  (How many people do you personally know who are not gay and who have AIDS?  Think about that, now that the disease has been with us more than a decade...)  What the media are saying about this disease isn't true.  What the author says is calm, authoritative, well-researched and well-written.  Should be required reading for every journalist and teacher in the land.	2002-06-24

Not sure why.  He has a great gift for dialogue, writes smoothly, and in patches his books were terrific and reminiscent of the best of Elmore Leonard.  That was the problem -- patches.  He still does not quite have tight plotting down right and sometimes Right as Rain meanders around the landscape for a while before it gets back down to business.  Still, this book is a quantum leap ahead of his earlier stuff and encouraged me to buy his next book, Hell to Pay.  There are some authors who decline as they write (John le Carre) so their earlier works are their best.  Others, like Pelecanos, just get better and better.  So start with the most recent and work your way back if you care to.  It helps to know DC and the surrounding area to really get into his work.	2002-05-26

Can't wait for the next volume.  Extremely well written, smooth flowing prose.  It takes a lot of guts to start a boigraphy of LBJ with 105 pages of history of the US Senate from 1800, but Caro pulls it off smoothly and enjoyably.  Lots of research, lots of great prose, fascinating subject for a biography -- what more could you want?<BR>The only drawback -- and I almost deducted a few stars for this -- is that Caro is a charter member of the knee-jerk liberal club.  Got any kind of problem?  Quick -- enact more laws, have the Federal government spend more money!  Caro never met a regulation he didn't like, including, remarkably, rent control, a dismal failure everywhere it has been tried.  He also hates the South and every senator from the South, and calls all Republicans &quot;Neanderthals&quot; and &quot;primitives&quot;.  This gets hard to stomach pretty fast.  It is annoying to have to make allowances for his flagrant biases on every page, but the book is still worthwhile.	2002-05-20

I was misled by a favorable review in the Financial Times into buying this thing.  Gets two stars only because of the author's prose style which has occasional great flashes of succinct wit and beauty.  But the main story is boring, boring, boring and not credible.  All the characters are far too passive; they drift along borne by a current of events, making little observations as they drift by.  Even an academic would surely react less passively to what happens to a beloved daughter.  This attitude is a sure receipe for tedium.  This book is also a classic example of why novels about novelists writing a novel should never be written; they just dead-end in a hall of mirrors.  This one is better than most of this genre, but still flops.  The author's repeated explicit statement that &quot;I know this would be dangerous if I were seriously attempting it&quot; in an effort to ironically detach herself from the trap does not succeed.  (Authors:  Please don't try this at home.)  And a news flash:  Moaning for pages and pages and pages about how female authors and characters have been marginalized for centuries does not justify the artistic failure inherent in marginalizing all the male characters in the book, who are poorly-realized cardboard cutouts.

Want to know what enlisted life in the Army is like without leaving your comfortable armchair?  Buy this and turn off the phone.  Brilliant reconstruction of Army life, that alternate society that too few Americans today know.  Shows the love and esprit de corps that a small unit can develop, where it comes from, and what can tear it apart.  Plus the author writes prose that is as cool, clear, and swift as a flowing mountain stream.  The proofreader needs to spend several months doing PT at Ft. Bragg -- parachute lines are \\"taut\\" not \\"taught\\" and it is inexcusable to have \\"173rd\\" and \\"1/73rd\\" on the same page, particularly since the 173rd plays such a major role in the book.  This is the real deal; buy it at once.

Although at first glance the subject and characters were far from my usual interests, I was pulled into it and rapidly became entranced by it.  It has many dimensions, is flawlessly written and structured, and transforms you.  In some respects it is an extended meditation on Jack Kerouac's On The Road, which is central to the theme, but it is hard to characterize the whole book as it is bigger than any simplistic summary.  The author understands Madison Avenue, the enigmatic rich, thirty-something bright but warped people, and much more and is able to make them come alive.  In many ways this is a sad book.  There are five sets of parent/child relationships at all stages of life, from infancy to the death or disintegration of parents in old age, explored in some depth, all different, all seriously flawed and at times heartbreaking.  The author needs to break away from the lingering university scene (too much of the book is set at Berkeley, NYU, Columbia, Spokane, and Charlottesville) but this is not irritating as he gently deflates the pomposities of each place and all feel different in his descriptions.<BR>May Dee live a thousand years and write a thousand books every year.

How did this thing ever find a publisher?  It says a lot about the NPR mentality that the author, their chief financial and business correspondent, cannot distinguish between investing in the stock market and going to Las Vegas.  The author has no background in economics or finance, no experience in the financial world, no respect for free markets, and no clue about what is going on in the world around him.  Alas, ignorance is not bliss in this case.

Worst book I've read all year (this is being written in late November) and strong contender for worst book of the decade.  Flat, leaden, dull prose.  Cardboard characters with no depth.  Silly little trivial asides.  No sense whatever of plotting, timing or narrative.  The author uses a true story from the pages of the Wall Street Journal as the basis for this book, but does not realize that he still has an obligation to write well and make the characters come alive -- you can't hang your words on an extoskeleton; the book has to have internal structure.  The ending is farcial, and the subplot conflict between father and son is a genuine embarassment to read.  Avoid at all costs.  I want my money back!!	2001-11-25

This is the first Ward Just book I have given less than 5 stars to, and I stand second to no one in my admiration for his skills as a writer.  The first piece (a play) is an embarassment.  We're all entitled to temper tantrums and to vent our spleen once in a while, but doing it in public and asking people to pay to watch is not right.  Enough said.  The two short stories are vintage Just and pretty good, but there are problems.  He has a lawyer in the 1960's talking about &quot;expanding the business&quot; which no lawyer of that era would ever have said; &quot;expanding the practice&quot; is correct.  And there is &quot;moot court&quot; and &quot;mock trial&quot; at law school, but never &quot;mock court&quot;.  The introduction in a vain effort at blue-collar solidarity talks about how difficult it is to drive a &quot;sixteen-wheeler&quot;.  This would be a lot more convincing if it were correctly identified as an &quot;eighteen-wheeler&quot;.  If you like Just, you won't be able to resist any of his books no matter what I say.  If you don't know him, don't start here -- read his other books first and then come to this one last, if ever.	2001-11-13

Due almost entirely to the silly machinations of the naive and smug author, an Assistant Professor of history at Princeton.  He prances through the pages of this shocking story of his jury duty very pleased with himself -- congratulating himself on eating nuts and fruits while others eat meat, enjoying literary chats about Wallace Stevens with a fellow juror who is a kindred soul, and making snide remarks about others, i.e.  &quot;I think I figured anyone wearing, apparently without irony, a large cast belt buckle reading 'Rodeo' had to be a law-and-order type, and quite possibly a bigot, too.&quot; -- page 91.  You can read all that from a belt buckle?  And how do you discern that someone is wearing it &quot;apparently without irony&quot;?  (Assistant Professor Burnett is no doubt lecturing his students at Princeton about tolerance and diversity as I write).<br />The most nauseating feature of this book is how the author, chosen as foreman, misleads, confuses, bewilders, divides and harasses the rest of the jury into coming back with a wholly unwarranted acquittal.  Of course there are always doubts, especially when someone is killed and the only surviving witness is the defendant, but are they reasonable doubts?  The author magnifies every tiny inconsistency into something larger than it really is -- if he sat on every jury in America, no one would ever be convicted.  Not to mention his tin ear for street smarts and total lack of common sense.<br />This is a shameful story of abdication of civic duty and will be read -- if it is read at all -- with repellent horror.	2001-09-21

Their interaction with each other and the world unfolds in a fascinating tale.  Parts of this book are so overwhelmingly sad that it is difficult to go on, but it is worth the effort. (Parts of it -- especially the minor episodes of overheard conversations in a deli and an elevator are screamingly funny).  Franzen has a great way with dialogue and description, to the extent that you forget you are reading a book for minutes on end and are just caught up in it.  Makes Don DeLilo look like Danielle Steel.  If only all contemporary writers could write like this and Tom Wolfe...I guarantee you won't be disappointed.	2001-09-09

It has everything:  a riveting plot, good dialogue, a steady relentless pace, and, most importantly, superb characterization.  A great sin of novels about Asia is that far too often the local characters are cardboard cutouts, mere background scenery agains which the Westerners play out their drama.  All of Jim Webb's Asian characters are fully realized and rounded, and subtly differentiated from each other.  He is a terrific writer and here he is at the peak of his craft.  If you're a Vietnam veteran (as I am) you will find this book particularly poignant.  If you're not, you'll gain some insight into why we feel we loved our country more than it loved us back.  Semper fi, Jim, and keep on writing.	2001-09-03

Contains interesting details of life in the US Army and in Charleston not found elsewhere to the degree that you feel you are actually there. The author shifts easily back and forth to Washington DC for higher-level decisions. Interesting character sketches of Major Anderson and others involved in these perilous times. I would have given this five stars but for the author's weird tangents (McDonalds likes to fly the American flag? &quot;It takes two to tango, but only one to do the twist&quot;? etc.). He has been hanging around academia too long and occasionally slips in these bizarre little asides. Second only to Winik's April 1865 (describing the other end of the war) in this year's crop of War Between the States books. Buy it and ignore the groan-inducing little cutesies.	2001-08-28

The author's idea of recreating a vanished era is to say, over and over and over again, that some characters had a martini and smoked Marlboros.  This consistently falls flat and doesn't work.  Nor do the periodic song lyrics he sprinkles throughout do anything for the atmosphere.<br />The typos and sloppy editing don't help either; on page 153 we are treated to Lyford &quot;Keys&quot;, &quot;Glouchester&quot; and the CIA's top lawyer being referred to as it &quot;general consul,&quot; an error that appears here and elsewhere.  More serious errors crop up too; Allen Dulles was never referred to as the Great White Case Officer; that was Ted Shackley.  The imagined conversations of real historical figures never quite take wing. There are much more serious flaws too.  This book raises some interesting and important political issues but never resolves them.  The author needs to learn that coming to a conclusion is what literature is all about -- the failure to do so here is a giant cop-out which leads us exactly nowhere by the end of the book.  Anybody can write ambiguous and inconclusive endings; good authors take sides and resolve the conflicts they create.  I won't ruin the ending but must say it is disappointing in the extreme.  On the other hand, if you enjoy America-bashing and the moral equivalence theory (the US and USSR were equally at fault in the Cold War) you will like this sentimental and overwrought version of it. Good points:  The author has a nice way with dialogue and there are some excellent descriptive passages about the mythical country of Kurash.  He also handles the alternation between past and present events very well; time jumps back and forth but is skillfully handled so the reader is never confused.  I'll buy his next book in the hope that he will improve; the basic skills are there but are not realized in this one.	2001-08-20

This is an intriguing account of a now-obscure epoch in American history.  The author brings to life the discomfort and apprehension suffered by the settlers with hostile and violent tribes as their neighbors and the sometimes tragic way the conflict was resolved.  Sometimes the parleys Jackson held with the Indians blur together into one big similar meeting, but this is a minor fault.  Just as good as Remini's study of the Battle of New Orleans.	2001-08-16

The author is a not very interesting sad case.  Having washed out of Marine Corps OCS he turns against the entire United States and its armed forces.  The story is one of personal cowardice in search of a moral justification which the author is pathetically unable to provide.  Why publishers remain obsessed with deserters and antiwar protestors remains a mystery to me; I'd rather read about the heroism of the men who served in Vietnam.  I'd like to invite the author to come to any of the many military unit reunions held every year in the US to celebrate the brotherhood and comradeship of those of us who answered our country's call in its hour of need, some reluctantly but all did their duty.  Come and see what you missed; the hollow sense of shame that pervades your book will be easier to understand.	2001-08-16

One was a deliberate official act (the NVA and VC were given lists of names and addresses to target prepared by their intelligence people) and the other an aberration (every two-bit Seymour Hersh wanna be has been looking for other US Army massacres since 1969 and finding only dry wells) which was investigated and punished.  Langguth fails this test miserably, misinterpreting both events.  His fly-on-the-wall attempts to reconstruct insider politics doesn't come across credibly either.  It is particularly shameful that he abruptly ends his book in May 1975 ingnoring the Cambodian holocaust, the Vietnamese boat people and other tragic consequences of his reporting.  (I spent a year in Vietnam as an Army officer in 1968-69 and four years doing aid work in Cambodia in 1996-2000 so I have seen it firsthand).  This book is just more tired, establishment press late hits and piling on...save the trees and buy &quot;Stolen Valor&quot; instead.	2001-04-02

Too bad; it had a strong finish, the fell apart rapidly.  Only gets two stars because it is well written in parts and moves smartly along.  Far too many coincidences, a cariacature philosophy professor (reads like a bad term paper on Nietzche in places) and a cliche-riden middle-aged leftover hippie townie, full of a nice middle-class boy's wholly imaginary idea of how rich people live (buy a copy of &quot;Town and Country&quot; if you really want to know).

It has changed my outlook (sorry!) on this excellent program.  Beforehand I was using about 2% of its features and now I am managing my whole business and personal life from it.  This well-written guide (better than most &quot;Program X for Dummies' books) leads you step by step through the features of Outlook and how they interact with each other.  It is an amazingly handy program but you need this book to show you all its features -- some of them are hidden, not on the toolbars, and you need to know where to right-click the mouse.  This book has it all.  Read it straight through and practice as you go, then hang on to it as a reference work in case you forget.

They are too narrow and this vein has been strip-mined out to the point of tedium...how many ways can you make fun of deconstruction and Jacques Derrida before the audience goes to sleep?  Also the canvases are too narrow; in the real world few care about who will be the next department chair.<br />This book is a nice exception.  It is well-written to the highest standard and manages to rise above the limits of the genre.  In some ways it is as fresh as Lucky Jim the Ur-academia piece.  There are a few annoying bits -- the set-piece faculty lunch in the beginning seems too artificial, the duelling Shakespeare insult fest in the middle is just showing off by the author and unrealistic, and at times it tries too hard to be a roman a clef (yes, yes, we all get the pun about Stanley Fish).  Having said all that this is still a good read with believable characters (not cardboard cutouts) and well done.  Buy it despite these faults; I'm going out and buy the rest of the author's works on the strength of this one.	2001-03-04

Excellent dissection and skewering of the decidedly mixed motives of those, celebrities and ordinary aid workers alike, who try to do good in the hot climates.  Read it as excellent fiction even if you don't care about the topic; read it as a great commentary on aid and aid workers if you'r at all familiar with the field.

Larry Elder tells it like it is in flawless prose and dispels a lot of PC myths.  It is astounding how we Americans continue to need reminder after reminder about some home truths and immutable facts of life, but we do.  Personal responsibility for your own acts and their consequences vs. advanced victimology of an increasingly powerful government is a theme that runs throughout.  I was horrified at the descriptions in the first chapter of the malignant thought cancers eating away at blacks and their so-called leadership in America.  Larry dispels a lot of fog and untruth.  Fans of Rush Limbaugh, libertarians and others who have seen the truth will love this book.  If you're from the opposite end of the political spectrum, why not check out what this successful black American has to say about growing up in the USA, working hard to succeed and the wise conclusions he draws?	2001-02-18

I have never read anything like it.  The author has a clear,lyric but unobtrusive prose style and the ability to cast himself back in time to capture the flavor of American life decade by decade since 1900.  It's like looking at a collection of old Life magazines in the attic, only better.  Really makes you feel you were there.  Buy it and you will not regret it.	2001-02-10

The author does a lot of navel-gazing (he spends a couple of pages describing his feelings about how he addresses his lettersing the subject in his letters.  Monsieur Romand?  Jean Claude?  The author finally settles on Monsieur Jean-Claude which enlightens us about nothing except the author's mood which is irrelevant).  Second, the book is full of bloviating French philosophy and speculation on the meaning of life.  If you can stomach that sort of thing, fine, though I can't.  Third the translation into English is graceless and clunky -- it is far too literal word-by-word and simply gets in the way of the story.  Example:  &quot;It is for the defendant to say yes to the presence of cameras at the trial...&quot;  What's wrong with &quot;The defendant decides whether or not cameras may be present at the trial...&quot; which is smoother English?  Too much of this literalistic translation makes you feel after a while that you are listening to Pepe le Pew, the romantic French accented skunk in the Sylvester and Tweetie cartoons.<br />Be forewarned but please don't let any of these things hinder you from buying the book.  It is a fascinating tale and shines through the defective prose.  Ann Rule it ain't -- it's infinitely better.  The crime itself is sickening and its bald factual descriptions is riveting and by far the best part of the book.  You want to look away in horror but can't.	2001-02-10

It contains every left-wing cliche in the book about modern business and is biased.  My favorite example is his criticizing Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonalds, because -- hold on to your seats -- Kroc once offered to go into partnership with Walt Disney (they had served together in the Red Cross ambulance corps during World War I) and McDonalds and Disney have done some joint ventures, and Walt Disney once hired Werner von Braun to narrate a film about space exploration for Disney in the 1950's and von Braun had been a rocket scientist for the Germans during World War II and some of the raw material he used might have been made by concentration camp labor.<br />Huh?<br />Another major flaw:  Ignores the fundamentals of business.  This just in:  no one HAS to eat at McDonalds.  People do so because they want to.  McDonalds in turn tries (successfully) to understand what consumers want and give it to them.  It also tries to make a profit on its operations so it can stay in business and expand.  And no one HAS to work there; people do so because they want to.<br />The author makes this natural way of life sound very sinister.  It is not.  This book is hysterical nonsense.  Instead of wasting his time writing it, the author should go out and open a restaurant himself, one which practices all the &quot;virtues&quot; he thinks fast food restaurants lack.  Serve the food you think people should eat, pay your help wages you think are just and let them unionize, etc.  Offer the alternative instead of moaning and whining about the successful chains.  And let's see how long your ideas last in the real world...	2001-02-10

Don't be fooled by the jacket blurb or the other reviews -- this is a faculty novel in disguise with all the shortcomings and defects of that genre.  To wit:  Childish and unappealing characters.  Very little action which is always preceded by endless talk and indecision and followed by endless analysis and reflection (especially when they have sex).  No character to the right of George McGovern.  Stakes too small to bear the weight of the prose.  Almost no one in this book actually works for a paycheck; everyone is a grad student, an adjunct professor or applying for a grant.  Setting the book in Boston/Cambridge does not help; it is just a Middlebury professor's idea of idea heaven.  The heroine's two chilren are rather revolting as is she and her lawyer-lover.  The ideas are confused as is the plot and theme, and the ethical issues and dramatic conflict are never fully realized or adequately discussed.<br />The only saving grace of this book is that the author writes quite well.  He can even do good dialogue which is rare in over-narrative academic novels.  What he needs to do is work on a tramp steamer or spend a year in Tijuana or in a factory or something to get away from the bloodless overanalytical tepid world of academia.  If he had something good to write about he'd be an excellent writer.  A big disappointment; hope he will keep writing and do better next time.	2001-02-06

It helps to bring some political knowledge to this story -- if you don't know who Joe McCarthy, McGeorge Bundy, Adlai Stevenson, Dean Rusk and others are and were, you will miss some of the book's subtler themes and dimensions.  A powerful and beautifully written story about the permanent overclass of Washington DC -- the men who run the country from behind the scenery and their conflicts with their women.

I am not sure what the author is getting at -- 8 pages of coverage of Indonesia, including the downing of CIA pilot Allen Pope?  This is an interesting story but has about as much to do with Vietnam as whether Margaret Thatcher prefers martinis to manhattans.  The author completely mangles the significance of the Tet offensive -- a military rout but a propaganda victory for the North -- and actually claims the North Vietnamese were not interested in domestic American political reaction!!  (It's how they won the war, as they are currently the first to tell you).  The leftist bias shows too -- lots of coverage of the &quot;antiwar&quot; movement but one searches in vain for any stories about GIs.  Can't even find any mention of General Hershey or the draft, or the building of the Wall (one tiny mention on p. 4 in the context of discussing how many women served in Nam!), downplaying of the NVA/VC massacre in Hue of 3-5,000 innocent people and their families but lots of discussion of My Lai, etc., etc.  Not a good introduction to the subject.  Not good at all.  Almost any other book on Vietnam is a better place to start, including Stewart O'Nan's college anthology or his novel The Names of the Dead, or COL Harry Summers Atlas of the Vietnam War.<br />And, yes, I know whereof I speak -- served in Vietnam in the US Army in 1968-69.	2001-01-14

US	52978849	R1FA49I8XIQJHB	0471498114	385140146	Inventing Money: The Story of Long-Term Capital Management and the Legends Behind It	Books	1	13	20	N	Y	Dull, duller, dullest...	...and slow, slower, slowest.  This book tries -- but fails.  Other reviewers have given it credit for explaining some of the complex math involved in hedging and trading but it fumbles this task.  The explanations are too complex (and written in turgid prose) for the novice and grossly oversimplified (still written in turgid prose) for anyone with even a smattering of knowledge in this area.  Insight into the principals of LTCM is non-existent; the author has no access to them.  The prose style is consistently whatever the opposite of scintillating is.  And the pace is leaden...far too much back story.  This is a 224-page book (not counting the Afterword, notes and index).  LTCM isn't even formed until more than halfway through (p. 125) and doesn't go bust (the most interesting part of the story; who would read a book about LTCM if it hadn't done so?) until p. 175.  A waste of time.	2000-12-31
US	52978849	R1807UJX8LAUKX	0743215052	769417678	The Constant Gardener: A Novel	Books	4	30	56	N	N	Serious mismatch between author and subject	This is the first le Carre book I have given less than 5 stars as he is one of my all-time favourites.  And let's face it, bad le Carre is better than most other authors' best efforts.  Difficult to sum up the varied reactions this book produces in a single review, but here goes:<br />1.  Good points.  Usual flawless prose, excellent characterisation, a real sense of scene (but see below) and a good pace throughout.  No one does interrogations better than le Carre and that skill is on display here.<br />2.  Bad points.  The villain/antagonist is a complete straw man and trendy-left rubbish.  It is no secret by now that le Carre has, for reasons best known to him, gone after pharmaceutical companies.  His criticisms as expressed in this book (and its non-fiction afterword) are naive and uninformed.  Andrew Sullivan in a review in the Sunday Times pointed out that only 1 of 5,000 drugs invented in the laboratory even make it to clinical trials, and only 30% of those that pass clinical trials earn back their development costs -- and Sullivan, as someone with AIDS, is very grateful to the pharma boys for coming up with his (expensive but) lifesaving drugs.  The NGO whiners who criticise commercial operations like this and whom le Carre admires so much have no alternative.  I always like to suggest that critics of this type start their own pharma company, garment factory or whatever with their own money and run them on what they think are proper principles as an example -- not just try to force others to obey their unelected and unaccountable selves.  (If this seems like misplaced criticism of a work of fiction it is because of le Carre's afterword attempting to ground this novel in 'fact' and inviting donations to a German NGO critical of pharma companies and his articles in the Times, Telegraph and Spectator allegedly factual which accompanied publication of this book.)  And it doesn't work as fiction either -- the villains he attempts to create are straw men without credibility.<br />Summary:  A great potter working with third-rate clay.  If you're new to le Carre don't start with this book -- read the Smiley books first then this one.  However, if you know le Carre already and can put up with the major structual flaw and not laugh out loud at times you will enjoy this book -- as, for all its flaws, I ultimately did.	2000-12-25

The prose is flat and insipid; the characters unexciting and drab; the pace leaden.  Reading this is slightly less exciting than watching paint dry.  The author has done some historical research and can't just use it; where he pops in an historical detail he elbows you in the ribs to draw attention to his cleverness.

But this is far from her best work.  If you don't know Margaret Atwood, don't start here -- The Robber Bride and Handmaid's Tale are much better and I strongly recommend them.  Virtues of this book:  Interesting story, well written.  Vices:  (1) Too long!  520 pages is about 1/3 longer than this book should be.  Hello, any editors in the house?  (2) Cheap technique of anonymous story (Can you guess who this couple are, gentle reader?) is too obvious and corny, adds nothing to book.  (3) Flashback and flashforward structure constantly wears thin after a while.  Summary:  Good story, interesting characters, flawless prose, but severe structrural defects.	2000-11-11
US	52978849	RVIZKPCZAYJEU	0684838990	481392482	Gang of Five: Leaders at the Center of the Conservative Crusade	Books	1	49	82	N	Y	Biased, trivial and revolting	The author utterly fails to come anywhere close to writing a serious, thoughtful book on the five men chosen as its subjects or their ideas and impact on American society and politics.  This is a shame because the subject is interesting and vital.  She absolutely refuses to take the ideas of the five men whose biographies she writes seriously -- I don't mean that she has to agree with their ideas to write a good book, but an author covering this subject at the very least owes it to her readers (and herself) to become familiar with the ideas and guiding principles of men like this.  After all, they are serious well-educated thinkers.  She absolutely refuses to do so.  Instead, this book is an Oprah-ized People magazine level snide personal attack.  The author dwells obsessively on the high school and college years (and mistakes and flaws) of her five subjects and attempts cheap dime-store psychoanalysis.  She seems to be of the opinion that holding right wing views is pathological and her approach is to try to explain the causes of this pathology -- preaching to the choir at its worst.  And that is the central flaw of this book, which skirts the edge of some vitally important topics and political ideas.  Her treatment of affirmative action is particularly illustrative and shabby.  Is it a good remedy for America's current racial problems?  Or does it foster divisiveness between races, violate the Constitution and do more harm than good to its intended beneficiaries?  There are serious arguments on both sides of this issue and it is a subject on which reasonable and thoughtful people can sincerely differ.  The author describes and attempts to deal with exactly none of theses matters, but just blithely assumes and states that anyone opposed to affirmative action is a racist.  From such starting assumptions and biases the book degenerates into a who-called-whom description of political tactics (never a pretty activity on the left or on the right) and personal smears ofits subjects.  It is tedious and uninformative in the extreme.  It is generally a mistake to write a book about people you dislike and cannot begin to understand; this book shows why.	2000-10-22

Lots of details and human interest liven up a subject that is always on the edge of putting some readers to sleep.  This book surveys code-breaking in both the European and Pacific theaters of war and even-handedly deals with the contributions of both the Brits and the Yanks (all too few books on this topic do so).  The author wisely puts the most arcane bits of math in appendices.<br />Very well done and hightly recommended to both those who have never read a book on this subject and those who have read several.	2000-10-19

Finds it necessary to shove a smarmy apology for about a paragraph for throwing in some history (Anti-Federalists, Whigs, etc.) which is essential to understanding Republican roots and the daytime TV level apology ends up running almost longer than the very brief historical background.

Baker has done his homework, writes fluently and easily, and tells a compelling story from beginning to end.  It is really saddening to watch the noble intentions of Henry Hyde, Ken Starr and others get trashed and twisted by the enablers surrounding Clinton, who has degraded public service and spawned a lot of evil.  But even if you don't agree with that personal view -- in fact, even if you are diametrically opposed to it -- you will enjoy this book.  THE definitive work on the whole crisis.  Buy it and read it no matter what your politics or what your level of interest in Insider Washington; a terrific read on many levels.	2000-09-29

I only wish I had had this book at the beginning of my time there.   It reveals what needs to be done to bring the third world out of poverty.   Full of simple but powerful ideas.  I only hope the development bureaucracy  will adopt it.  Sound property laws enable land and other assets currently  not marketable, saleable or mortgageable to be used as collateral for  enterprises (as in the West), and there is more of such property out there  in the world than all the Western aid since the beginning of time to all  other countries!

The substance of  this book is terrific -- especially the revelations about the thwarted  investigation into the Gore/Clinton manipulation of the INS to ram through  naturalizations of unqualified aliens before the last election to pump up  the Democratic vote.  The rest of the book has other hard-hitting material  on Clinton sleaze.  Alas, most of the latter is snipped verbatim from the  Congressional record transcripts or is clearly simply a transcript with  very little editing of David Schippers rambling into a tape recorder.  Even  the presence of a ghost writer doesn't help the awkward style.  The nearly  2 years since the events of this book took place should have allowed for  better crafted prose.

Why we should care about the brief employment of this characterless  wonder at an overpaid law firm is a mystery not resolved by this book.   Like the author I graduated from Harvard Law School and went to work for a  large Wall Street law firm -- only I did it because I believed it was  socially useful and challenging work.  The author did it despite his  beliefs -- just for the money. I suppose this makes him a  &quot;professional&quot;.  As the moral dimension of this sordid book is  completely lacking, it makes for dull reading.  Are we really supposed to  sympathize with someone who is paid $85,000 per year plus bonus because he  has to stay late at work and is busy?  When he breaks down and cries after  a single week in a warehouse of documents he is supposed to review the book  reaches rock bottom -- only certifiable yuppies could sympathise with this.  Peasants and coal miners might have reason to cry but not this pampered  preppie.  A dull, dispirited, depressing book.  Avoid it at all costs.  A  good example of why people should not write books about things they dislike  -- makes for dull or offensive reading.	2000-08-30

This misshapen thing is terrible -- not least  because of the cardboard cutout cliche Vietnam veteran character.

The  classic NYer profile-expanded-into-a-book was John Hershey's  &quot;Hiroshima&quot; and it was followed by lots of good ones from Berton  Rouche and others.  This book has the same origins but the author injects  herself into the book far too much and is not an interesting person in her  own right.  In addition to being dull, she is a condescending New Yorker  (geographical reference this time) who knows nothing about the rest of  America -- and it shows.  This book does have its moments -- especially the  accounts of the 19th century ordchid hunters and their adventures, but we  are all too quickly back in the author's navel gazing.	2000-07-10

Ms. Kaplan, a professor of Romance Studies and Literature at  Duke, falls eagerly into this trap.  Brasillach, her subject, is an  obscure, weak, minor figure, not interesting enough to sustain the length  of this book.  There is nothing terribly interesting about a man who  enjoyed his time as a POW and in jail in 1945 more than the rest of his  life as an obscure literary critic and bad novelist.  It is only mildly  entertaining to watch Kaplan struggle not to condemn Brasillach's obscene  anti-semitism (even though she makes much of her abhorrence thereof and her  father's service as a Nurembeg prosecutor) because he was a homosexual and  she cannot afford (as a Duke professor) even the faintest whiff of  &quot;homophobia&quot;.  Alas, this leads to such dumb, anachronistic  sentences as &quot;A critic of our own generation might be more likely to  ask how many homosexuals were drawn into the resistance out of disgust with  Vichy's family values.&quot;  She also glides too rapidly over the  relationship between his sexuality and the attraction of Nazi life, a  callow and insipid approach that insists on viewing gays as just normal Tom  and Judy suburban couples who just HAPPEN to like members of the same sex.  T'ain't so.  (There's a reason for all those leather bars Ms. Kaplan...)   There's also a hidden subtext here; many of the deconstructionists were  collabos or worse during WWII and this book might be read as a sneaky  apologia for them.<br />There are plenty of stories of heroism and tragedy  from the Resistance.  This isn't one of them.  Reasonably well written, but  the subject matter and characters aren't compelling enough to keep interest  up.  Read Sebastian Faulk's novel Charlotte Gray or Robert James' Vichy  novels instead if you're interested in the period.	2000-05-17

There are armies trained to win wars and armies run as social experiments by civilians who have never served...pick one.  This book blasts the gutless wonders who have given America the second kind. This book is a good  cure for what a writer the author quotes calls &quot;military  illiteracy&quot; -- the current state of affairs in the US where most of  the population has no first-hand experience with military service (or even  second-hand experience through a father, brother or husband) and  consequently thinks working for General Powell is just like working for  General Electric.  This book ably demonstrates that it ain't even close.   When you have to live together 24-7-365 in close conditions, be ready to  give your life for your buddies in an instant, etc. normal social rules  don't apply.  They never did, but America has forgotten this hard-earned  lesson.<br />The author thinks we are going to have to lose a war to wake up  to biological differences (why don't women play in the NFL?).  I am afraid  she's right.<br />Today's military has other problems beside vainly attempting  to ignore biological differences (lack of respect for Commander in Chief  Clinton, foolish attempts to use troops as social workers with M-16s on  humanitarian missions, etc.) but this gender thing is a huge problem.  Ask  yourself if you would like to be on a battlefield with a woman who simply  does not have the strengh to carry you off if you are wounded (almost none  do) or a strong man who can.<br />The author does a masterful job of exploring  and exposing the problems raised by this tragically foolish policy .   Well-written, balanced and fascinating -- a good book for Americans (and  citizens of other countries) who want to have a serious look at the role of  their countries' armed forces, the relationship between them and the rest  of society, what sets soldiers apart from civilians and what they have in  common.  These aren't simple issues and the author treats them in a  thoughtful and powerful fashion.  Highly recommended.<br />And, yes, I do know  whereof I speak -- US Army 1966-69, Vietnam service 1968-69.	2000-05-16

Real people, real countryside, real action.  A glimpse into a little-known and faxcinating part of American.   The author has a smooth prose style, the kind that is so  transparent it makes you forget you are reading for a while, and only in  retrospect do you realize how well this book is written -- the way it ought  to be.  Another pleasant surprise:  Not all the natives are environmentally  sensitive Alan Alda in sealskin types, there are some well-delineated nasty  native villains in here as well.  Minor drawback:  A key bit of the plot  was far too contrived (no one would dig a root cellar with a lid overhead;  you can't hold a strong person down with a mere 4 nails; kicking upward  would have been the obvious and effective choice).  (This ciriticism  doesn't give away the ending or anything critical to enjoying the book -- I  don't write that kind of review).  This is minor; all-in-all, a very good  read.	2000-04-30

These are all valuable works about a subject that has  had more misinformation published about it that any other three topics  combined.

Her earlier works, especially Hunters and Gatherers and Primitive People were among the best books I have ever read.  This one disappoints -- the protagonist is a passive blob of  jelly who is wheeled from scene to scene and does nothing about anything  occurring around him.  The ending necessarily falls flat as a result of  this.  It is also too obviously contrived -- like one of those  Shakespearean plays where every character gathers onstage for the last  scene and everyhting is tidily wrapped up.  Still, the other characters are  well-drawn and interesting and the writing, as always in her work, is  clear, refreshing and carries you along.  If you have read her earlier  works, this one is worth reading (though you might wait for the paperback).   If you don't yet know Francine Prose, start with one of her earlier books.	2000-04-29

I have lived in Phnom Penh for 5 years and laughed out loud at some of the mis-descriptions of the city and its people contained in this turkey.  It  is all too obviously based on Robert Stone's Dog Soldiers, a much superior  book in every respect.  If you enjoy novels about troubled preppies playing  out their war fantasies against a background of third world people (who are  never raised by the author above the level of furniture and scenery) you'll  love this meditation on the problems of yuppies abroad.  I mean, what IS  the meaning of life, man?  Save your money.	2000-04-29

Yes, the author is biased against the white people in this fascinating story.  But he is candid enough to admit it and those instances when this prejudice appear are easy to identify and thus  deal with on the part of an alert reader.  Why the author thinks you cannot  love your grandfather and respect his accomplishments even though he was  flawed (as all human beings are) is a great mystery.  Why he thinks sins  are inherited is even more mystifying.<br />2.  Yes, the family trees are  confusing but the anecdotes are great<br />3.  Well-written.<br />4.  Written by  a Yankee, yes, but one with a fascination for the South.<br />Summation:  This  book has flaws but it is still well worth reading and much better than  Slaves in the Family or Confederates in the Attic	2000-03-12

Well-written, thought provoking and brings back a lot of weird and wonderful stuff we have all forgotten in the intervening 20 or 30 years since the '70's ended.  The one  thing I'm disappointed he left out of the chapter on the growth of distrust  in the competence of government is Skylab -- I vividly remember the parties  we threw the night this chunk of metal the size of a doublewide came  crashing down to earth (no one knew where it was going to land).  There was  a brief craze for painting a big bullseye on the roof of your house on the  theory that the government was so incompetent that that was the safest way  to make sure Skylab DIDN'T land on you.  This book is full of great not so  trivial trivia like that.<br />To those other reviewers who seem to be hung up  on the abandonment of Sourth Vietnam, that is exactly the right word for  what happened in 1973-75 as this book makes clear  It made a mockery of the  58,000 -- not the 50,000 you keep citing -- American lives earlier  sacrificed in a good cause, not to mention the millions of Vietnamese and  Cambodians who died and suffered.  Anyway, your politics don't belong in a  book review any more than mine do.  Stick to the topic.<br />This book is well  worth reading no matter what your political perspectives are.	2000-03-12

I would unhesitatingly give this book five stars if  it were not for the fact that the author has a feminist ax to grind and  keeps grinding it in the most inappropriate places -- it's a bit like going  to an opera and every five minutes the leading tenor feels compelled to  wave Chairman Mao's Little Red Book about and quote from it.  I suppose she  will have to be forgiven as she is an academic at an East coast university  and would probably be disbarred if she did not bung this feminist rhetoric  into everything she writes.  Her ax is only a mediom-sized one and she does  keep it mostly under control, but it does detract from the rest of the  book.  Without this stuff this would be a five star book.  I recommend you  buy it, read it and ignore the PC stuff that crops up every fifth page or  so.  Hope she will write some more history books and tone down the rhet.	2000-03-03

It is supposed to be a period piece/historical novel about the 1970's, but the references are just sprinkled in every 2 or 3  pages and don't really have anything to do with the plot -- could have been  set in almost any era.  Second, the two teenage boys around whom the plot  revolves act very implausibly for boys of their age.  I must say I did like  the portrayal of the Vietnam veteran character (I am one) -- nicely  balanced.  Tom Wolfe's A Man in Full is a better look at the same subject.	2000-02-27

Also the author does not understand 17-year-old boys and has them do things that are psychologically  implausible.  Nice prose style, but I lost interest and abandoned the book  2/3 of the way through (sopmething I almost never do) as just too tedious  to finish.	2000-02-13

All others beware -- it is as tedious and unenlightening as anyone else's late adolescence and spends a  lot of time describing acne, masturbation and Beatles' music.  It is  accurate in its details (every page or two the author throws in a  contemporary musical or cultural reference) as other reviewers point out,  but these are patently articificial and are wholly irrelevant to the plot  or character development.  It barks.	2000-02-04

Lucid, flowing prose and an interesting subject.  The author is able to relate the details that make battles interesting from the point of view of the common soldier to the officers in charge, yet also  connects the events of battle to the war itself and larger diplomatic and  political issues thus highlighting their significance.  This book also has  what some good military histories foolishly lack -- good, detailed  battlefield maps that make the action understandable.

This book accurately skewers the hypocrisy and venality of some Christians, most leftists, all politicians, charities, etc. but its premise is utterly  flawed.  The reader is asked to automatically hate &quot;people from the  Ganges&quot; and they -- 100 million or so -- are collectively described in  awful, unfair and racist terms.

It seemed to me to be a balanced and comprehensive examination of this fascinating and most  American of religions.  One finishes the book a bit skeptical of the  authrenticity of the Mormon holy scriptures (too many anachronisms and  internal inconsistencies in Joseph Smith's &quot;revelations&quot;) but  very positively impressed with the strong family bonds and community that  this church has established and maintained.

The author falls in love with the people who try to prevent the death penalty from ever being imposed and the book is extremely one-sided.  He has no credentials, legal or other, to write on the subject  and strangely, for an academic, never even bothers to try to acquire any.   There are legitimate arguments for the death penalty--it is expressly  mentioned in the Constitution, so it is obviously Constitutional -- as well  as against it, but they are ignored, nor is any attempt made to explore the  position of the victim's family, judges, prsecutors, etc..  The author  spends pages describing how good looking the lawyers on his side of the  issue are!

The author has a quiet courage and wisdom he earned the hard way and couples it with artful prose.  I read this book straight through in one sitting yesterday and it still haunts me.   Covers a lot of different subjects -- family life, gun control, what  passes for &quot;higher education&quot; in America today, immigration, the  criminal and civil justice systems.  The author has learned much from his  encounter with all of these facets of American society and is able to pass  his wisdom on.<br />I have children but have never lost one.  The story of how  one man bore this unimaginable burden is riveting.  The author is a man of  courage to step up and tell this story without ever falling into  mawkishness -- this is the antithesis of Oprah and Jenny Jones, where  trivial problems are bloated up into allegedly meaningful crises.  This  book is worth a dozen 12-step programs and a hundred self-help feel-good  manuals.<br />Even though I disagree with the author on some points (the  Second Amendment's background and purposes, for example) I was very  impressed with his willingness to listen and learn -- he is a true liberal  in the classical sense of thoughtful analysis and tolerance for others'  points of view.<br />Even if you think the subject of this book is irrelevant  to your life or interests, buy it and read it.  You will learn a lot and  will not be able to put it down.<br />Galen Gibson was lucky to have the  author for his father during his short life, and is lucky to have him as  his chronicler after his death.	1999-11-25

As a member in good standing of the generation she writes about (b. 1944), I thought this was inaccurate...  Particularly galling was her treatment of Vietnam veterans (the segment of society discussed in this book I am most familiar with).  She falls into the trap of consorting only  with the professional apologists who hang around college campuses and the  My Lai guys (30 out of 3.5 million), when in fact as a Department of  Defense survey showed, 90% plus of us are proud to have served, think it  was a worthy cause and would gladly serve again.  See Stolen Valor for a  more detailed analysis of what Vietnam vets are really like.  I go to a  reunion every year and invite Ms. Faludi to come along and meet some normal  VN vets, quietly proud of our service, well-adjusted, comfortable in our  manhood<br />He inaccurate (and sometimes laughable) protrait of the  &quot;typical&quot; Vietnam vet inevitably made me skeptical of the rest of  the book.

I am impressed that an English professor could turn in such good work as an historian and cover the courtroom battles with  the skill of an experienced lawyer.  A well told story of an obscure, but  very revealing, chapter in the period just before the Civil War.    Minor  criticisms:  Too much is devoted to courtroom battles at the expense of  describing daily slave life.  As the author is a professor at a late 20th  Century American university, he feels it necessary from time to time to  wave his little red PC book in the air and shout slogans:  Slavery was  evil!  Racism is not nice!  Well, duh.  None of this adds to the book and  all of it detracts from the book.    Still, this is a good read.  Buy it;  you won't be disappointed.

I have never seen a book collapse so quickly.  I was caught up in it -- it has many virtues.  It is well written, interesting, covers an obscure  incident which should be better known...then I came to the last 100 words  which reduced the whole thing to the level of a Hallmark card or below.   They could have been omitted and the book would not suffer a bit and I  would have awarded it 5 stars.  However, they made me go back and review  the whole thing, and then I got suspicious of other passages where far too  much sentimentality and the author's own emotions (which are not as  interesting as he thinks they are)  crept in...

It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student/writers' workshop &quot;my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me&quot; trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.<br />Anyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.<br />I was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...<br />I hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work.	1999-09-19

Sorley does a masterful  job of bringing up the truth.  It is painful to read (America's betrayal of  a gallant ally and its own sons still tears at me) but enlightening.  Some  of the other reviews of this fine book reveal a lot more about the  reviewers' preconceptions than about the book itself -- or the truth.   Thank you Mr. Sorley for writing such a fine history -- from one who was  there as a soldier in 1968-69 Under GEN Abrams.	1999-09-14

The tortured effort to blame this  sicko's childhood woes and later psychopatholgy on his father's military  service is a pointless disgrace, and affects the credibility of the rest of  the book.

The two stories the author tells (a thwarted adoption in Connecticut; removal of 19 children from a group of sisters in Chicago) just don't hang together.  These two stories  have little in common, and the author is awkwadly trying to force them  together. 2.  The rest of the book is too cosmic -- trying to pigeonhole  everything from the feudal system to the Catholic church, and move back and  forth between those generalities and the two unrelated stories. 3.   Political bias.  Well, what can you expect from an author who teaches at  Columbia Journalism School (I know, I graduated from there in 1966)?  What  you get is someone who accepts what Bernardine Dohrn (a convicted criminal)  says and then sneers at Newt Gingrich (without, obviously, having ever read  anything Mr. Gingrich has had to say on the topic the author writes about).   So what we have here is coverage of the spectrum from slightly left of  center to way out there in left field. 4.  The author WILL NOT come to a  conclusion.  It's all &quot;on the one hand this, on the other hand  that&quot; which gives a surface impression of evenhandedness but in the  end is very frustrating. Still, parts of the story are well done -- the  Connecticul couple's story is the better written of the two.  All in all,  worth a look, especially if you're new to this field.	1999-09-04

Navel-gazing has its place, I suppose, if it is done with some wit and charm (see, for example, My Cousin  Robert Lowell), but this self-indulgent misshapen thing hits a new low.  It  reads like a letter to one's psychotherapist, and perhaps it should be just  that.  There are glimpses of the author's other family members, but she  does not even care enough about them to let us know what happens to them,  though we know every wrinkle and blue Monday that affects her precious  sensibilities.  As just one example, she explains how she came by the  childhood name of &quot;Booger&quot; -- an anecdote involving her love of  reading and her many afternoons spent in a brown leather chair, which her  siblings finally inspect the underside of...as you can readily imagine,  this anecdote is neither charming nor entertaining nor education nor  anything other than the purest self-indulgent narcissism.<br />Pass this  dreadful thing.  My Cousin Robert Lowell or 1185 Park Avenue are both much  better.<br />I initially bought this book because I am about 10 years older  than the author and went to school in the town where most of this story  takes place (Montclair, NJ).  I did not recognize her world at all.  This  is the worst book I have read all year, and I have seen some other prize  turkeys...	1999-07-11

A major  weakness is the Army/combat stuff, which was also the major weakness of his  first book.

It covers the entire history (1965-date) of an obscure (to some) chapter in America's war in Southeast Asia -- the loss of Lima Site 85 in Laos to  communist attack.  The whole history is fascinating -- from the decision to  set up this site, to what it (briefly) did, the decisions from the squad  level all the way up to the US Embassy in Vientiane and the President in  Washington about its mission, operation and defense, to the current efforts  to get the truth out of the Lao and Vietnamese governments about MIAs.  The  author has the background to write this fascinating history and writes  compellingly.  He's not afraid, where appropriate, to use blunt language  like &quot;shameful toadying&quot; and &quot;fraud&quot;.  I've been a  sceptic in the past of some of the distrust of the US government shown by  POW/MIA families and partisans, but this book opened my eyes.  Phou Pha Thi  should have been better defended or abandoned earlier.  A great account of  (mostly) good intentions and (too often) flawed execution.  The author  writes convincingly of 1960's combat and 1990's political maneuvering.  The  treatment of COL Clayton, the commander of the site when it was overrun, by  the current &quot;investigators&quot; was particularly revealing and  chilling.  I was a US Army Signal Corps officer during the Vietnam war and  know all too well what it's like to have to be visible on a mountaintop to  perform your mission and the need for good defense.  I've spent the last 4  years as a civilian in Cambodia.  So I have some parallels with the  authors' experiences.  A great book no matter what your view on the war.	1999-06-05

Sometime in the 1960's short story writing slipped out of the hands of adults who had actually gone out in the world and held jobs and had families and thus had  something to write about, and into the hands of graduate students.  These  workshop set pieces are dreadful and depressing and have little or nothing  to do with the South, The exceptions -- Ellen Douglas stands out -- are too  few and far between to make these books worthwhile.

As someone who has lived in SE Asia off and on for the past 30 years, I found some of the descriptions very well done.  But mostly this book is a collection of naive and erroneous trivia about  this part of the world.  The characters wander on and off stage, but  nothing much happens.  No plot, no character depth, no meaning. As usual,  the Asian characters are hopelessly undeveloped -- just background scenery  against which the Westerners indulge in their petty little love affairs  which could equally likely have taken place on 14th Street.  I was sorely  disappointed.  Buy Kalimantaan or even The Beach instead.	1999-04-16

I was quite surprised at the favorable jacket blurb from Alice Munro, one of my favorite authors, who does this sort of thing ever so much better.  The author obviously sat down and wrote  out a plot, then marched her cardboard characters through it -- it  certainly does not develop naturally from their characters and conflicts  between them.  Also many red herrings and pointless diversions as other  reviewers have noted.  The author also has a tin ear for dialogue; some of  the conversations between Amy and her best friend could have been better  written by a seventh grader.  Buy Alice Munro instead!	1999-04-04

Okay, that's difficult when he died before he could be interviewed or tried.  Like an overlong Vanity Fair  article, this book is full of brand names and oh so subtle &quot;I am hip  and you are not if you don't understand the allusions why are you reading  this you common little person&quot; condescending  references to people,  products and parties.  Ann Rule is better.  Also lacks a moral dimension as  is fashionable; no lifestyle can possibly be destructive enough to merit  condemnation or even a mild rebuke.  Nice prose style.	1999-04-03

However, the book itself is an awkward pastiche:  one particular murder case (and not a very interesting one), an account of the  child abuse hysteria which swept the US in the mid-1980's and resulted in a  lot of wrongful convictions, accounts of alleged miscarriages of justice  from all over the US, and a partisan history of one prosecutor's office.  It just doesn't hang together.  I agree with the author on some of his  points (esp. the harm done by the child abuse witch hunts), but he just  doesn't get it.  There's no such thing as a perfect trial; after the fact  you can always pick a hole here and a hole there, and if you believe all  the evidence on one side (defense or prosecution; doesn't matter) and are  skeptical about all the evidence on the other side, you can make side #2  look foolish.  The author also muddles things:  There are a lot of  statements like &quot;100 convictions were overturned because of either  prosecutorial misconduct OR later evidence proved the accused  innocent&quot; which on the next page becomes &quot;100 innocent  people&quot;.  Author does not realize that often the guilty do go free  because of honest mistakes of prosecutors.  Also he faults a very, very  large prosecutor's office if one investigator over here learns something  and one prosecutor over there doesn't know it all and disclose it the same  day.  A muddled book, unpersuasive on the points it tries to make.  (And,  no, I have never been a prosecutor or worked in law enforcement -- on the  contrary, I have represented a lot of criminal defendants).  Overall a most  disappointing book -- even the murder case is a pretty uninteresting one.  Any of Ann Rule's works beat this one cold.	1999-03-28

It is very much a woman's book -- a lot of emphasis on intra-family relationships, cooking, holiday times, seasonal changes, aging  -- rather than a bam/bang mystery story. (I get the distinct imporession  that all the other reviewers to date are women).   Not my usual cup of tea,  but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The author's prose style is clear and  flows so smoothly...I have also enjoyed her earlier work.  Buy this book  whether you are a man or a woman if you appreciate excellent writing.   Stronger on characterization and description than on plot, but so what?   Only 4 stars because the ending sort of trails off rather than resolving  much of anything, but up to then it is a very nice read.	1999-03-05

Despite the interest, it is TOO LONG at almost 400 pages -- it is repetitive in many places and could have been edited down to 250 pages  without losing anything.  Still, a good account of Haiti and the US Army.   It was very gratifying to see the author (who confessed he had never known  a soldier and whose impressions of Special Forces was from Vietnam --  actually MOVIES ABOUT Vietnam!) realize what fine troops they are, learn  some respect for them and generally enjoy having the blinders about the  military fall from his eyes.  He's about 90% of the way there...a telling  commentary on what American intellectuals don't know about their own  society and how estranged they are from their own military.  A bit  confusing on its coverage of Haitian politics (I know, the subject itself  is confusing, but a good writer should make the complex clear).  A good  history of a now-obscure military exercise.  I enjoyed it.  It is better  than Shacochis' previous fiction; hope he does another book like this one  with a better editor.	1999-03-03

It seems to be a selection of the author's worst pieces in the last 60 years.  Not up to the old New Yorker standards at  all.  Not to mention being a bit trendy-lefty (the pieces on the Kennedy an  Reagan inaugurals blast any hope of objectivity, and the Clinton election  piece is nauseating).

Higgins spends a lot of time on the sports world as seen through agents' eyes, and even though you couldn't pay me enought to  make me watch a hockey or basketball game, it was fascinating.  Just as  John McPhee in the nonfiction arena can write about oranges, or geology, or  taking out the trash, and by his prose skills make it fascinating to the  general reader, so too Higgins pulls off the same thing in this novel.  I  have been a fan of his since 1972 when his first book, The Friends of Eddie  Coyle, was published.  He writes a lot and rarely disappoints; he certainly  does not do so here.  Any reader who enjoys a good story, excellent prose  and first-rate dialogue will enjoy this book tremendously; if you're a  sports fan, you will have an additional dimension added to your enjoyment.	1999-01-23

I am a HUGE fan of Mr. Cook's and have read every single one of his other books that are still in print.  So I looked forward to this one with eager anticipation.  It is just dreadful.  I cannot believe it was even written  by the same man who wrote the Chatham School Affair or Breakheart Hill.  It  is mawkish, amateurish and a couple of other -ish that don't immediately  spring to mind.  Poorly written, an unbelievable plot, awkward in concept  and execution.  Buy one of this man's other books and you will be hooked,  but I'm afraid this one is a turkey.	1998-12-26

Here is an author who understands so many advanced concepts and who can write smoothly, clearly and convincingly, bearing the reader along with his keen and interesting mind.  Convincingly demonstrates  the interrelationships between different areas of modern mathematics.  Great mathematics for the layman without being in the slightest bit  condescending.  I have had an amateur's interest in mathematics since high  school but was never able to follow it up professionally.  This book is the  best I have read in the 30 years I have had this interest.  A delight to  read, educational and informative.	1998-12-25

If you JUST LOVE the Sixties and light matches at Peter Paul and Mary concerts, you'll probably be sentimental enough to enjoy this book.  His  other books make the Sixties come alive in an interesting and positive way;  this one falls flat.  The main character is an unappealing wimp and after  finishing half the book I didn't really care how his quest came out.  In  addition, this book is sloppily written and poorly edited -- there is  absolutely no excuse for robotically following a spell checker that wants  to change &quot;minyan&quot; to &quot;minion&quot; especially when this  occurs in the middle of several pages of Hebrew/Yiddish words...I guess we  should be grateful that it didn't become &quot;minivan&quot;.  Two stars is  generous; one and a half is more like it.  But his other books are worth a  read.	1998-12-17

Well researched and well written; the author writes as convincingly as if he had been there (as he was not) and the result is a  terrific tale.

He goes out of his way in this book to drag in a lot of Cold War issues that are only peripherally relevant to the Bundy brothers  -- including a long and rather tedious digression on how one of them edited  a book on the decision to bomb Hiroshima that the author, having written  his own book on the subject, disagrees with.  The fact that the author does  not like the tough decisions made by various Cold Warriors does not excuse  the one-sided, highly partisan and biased nature of this book.  Its  credibility is not enhanced by such elementary mistakes such as thinking  that First Lieutenant is a lower rank than Second Lieutenant, or  identifying someone as a lieutenant in a photo caption when his captain's  bars are clearly visible on his uniform.  Pass on this one and you will not  regret it.	1998-12-09

It is a beautiful book as a work of fiction,  and compellingly prophetic (it was written in 1955) about the future of  America's expedition into this strange and beautiful country.

You would think so,  but the author of this dreadful book has succeeded -- if that is the right  verb -- in doing just that.  She wilfully misunderstands and distorts  everything she writes about.  Every woman is either a feminist who agrees  with the author's PC stance on everything, or an oppressed suburban  housewife who would agree with the author about everything if only the  blinders would fall from her eyes.  The Vietnam War and the Cold War were  caused by male prep school headmansters (!).  You get the idea.  The  author's tin ear and leaden prose only make it worse. The said thing is  that her subject's life could, in competent hands, be a fascinating and  well-told talle, but the publication of this tepid biography will probably  prevent the issuance of a book worthy of its subject.  Mary Pinchot Meyer  deserved better and I hope someday another biographer will do her justice.  The publisher should be ashamed.  This dreadful thing is far, far below any  civilized standard and never should have been printed.	1998-11-24

It has less to do with Robert Lowell than the title and other reviews imply, but so what.  The rest of the author's family is just as interesting if not  more so.  She deals in a flinty steadfast New England way with  madness and  eccentiricity and writes with wit and charm, leaping effortlessly from  Plymouth Rock to the 1980's.  She has the very rare gift of being ironic  and insightful about herself and her growing up without degenerating into  self-pity.  An example from 1967:  &quot;Aunt Sarah talked of sending me to  Miss Porter's [finishing school], just as she talked about the coming-out  party she was going to given me in the garden in Manchester (but which I  declined because of the bombing of Vietnam, a connection that was a bit  clearer to me then).&quot; If you enjoy crystal clear prose, history and  getting to know some delightful characters, this one's for you.	1998-11-22

You would  think so, but the author has succeeded -- if that is the right word -- in  doing just that.  This book is callow, trite and flawed in almost every  respect.  The author shallowly misunderstands every one of the subjects  listed above and the history of the 1950's too.  Her leaden prose and tin  ear don't help.  This is a dreadful mix of politically correct staitjacked  thinking and PEOPLE magazine style fascination with the lives of people the  author does not understand. It is a shame this book was published, as the  underlying story is a fascinating one, and all this book will do is  postpone the publication of a decent book that does justice to the subject.   Mary Pinchot Meyer deserved a better biography than this, and I hope  someday someone else will write it...	1998-11-16

Ms. Coulter  proves that Clinton is getting away with actually doing stuff while Nixon  was impeached for only attempting (unsuccessfully) to do the same.

This is a terrific book, a previously obscure but fascinating incident  brought to light and examined in appropriate detail.  The author's style is  smooth and transparent, and this book really is a great pleasure to read  and most enlightening about many aspects of 1830's life in New York City  and America. The author does have an irritating habit of attributing  everything to feminist theory, often without any justification in fact  other than her pet theories.  For example, at one point a gang breaks into  a brothel, breaks some glasses, lights some fires, insults the madam and  the prostitutes.  The author insists &quot;They were not robbers...they  were contemptuous vandals, there to remind the women of the ultimate power  men have over them by sheer physical force and intimidation.&quot;  Well,  perhaps.  But it seems equally likely that they were sent as revenge by an  angry customer, to intimidate by a rival brothel keeper, to frighten the  madam into paying a debt...or a dozen other reasons.  I don't know.   Neither does the author of this book.  But she leaps to this conclusion and  allows of no other possibility, as she does in perhaps a dozen other places  in this book.  &quot;To the man with a new hammer, everything looks like a  nail&quot;  runs the old proverb, and one sees it at work here in these  dogmatic assertions based on nothing but the author's late 20th century  feminist theories.  Fortunately these passages  are few and far between in  this fine book.  Just ignore them when they pop up, and you will enjoy this  excellent work of history written in a refreshingly jargon-free style.	1998-10-20

I think you will  enjoy it if you have any interest at all in history.  I am not a Civil War  buff, though I have read a few books on it, but found this one terrifically  interesting.  The author gets into the details of soldiering -- picket  (sentry) duty with its long periods of boredom and tedium interspersed with  moments of attack and terror, garrison life, drills, train raids, naval  maneuvers, and makes it all come alive.  Unlike a lot of worm's eye only  books, this on does also get into higher strategy among the generals and  even Lincoln and his cabinet.  If you like this book, you'll like &quot;The  Long Surrender&quot; and vice versa.  I was fascinated by the soldiers on  each side sending toy sailboats across rivers, taking tobacco one way and  real coffee the other, and also exchanging newspapers and catcalls between  the Yankees and the Rebels.  A really fascinating slice of life, and an  interesting contrast, for me as a former soldier, in how America's armies  fought wars in 1863 and 1968.	1998-10-15

It gets one star only because that is the lowest rating the  Amazon software allows; I would rather give it none.  The author has a  clunky awkward style; the characters are flat stilted cliches and the plot  just meanders around in a vacuum.  I gave this book a fair trial (188/360  pages) and simply could not read any more and threw it out.  The author  tries to be cynical about people (and People, the magazine) who drop  others' names, but does the same thing herself.  Don't be fooled by the  Clinton connection trumpeted by the promoters; it's just made up and has  little, if anything, to do with this book.  This book is a dreadful  monotonous tedious shapeless thing; how it ever found a publisher is a  greater mystery than the one in the plot.	1998-10-12

But this one is far from her  best...beginning to sound like one endless story just chopped off in random  lengths, like salami.  And the one about the sick baby is disgusting and  foul.  If that happened to Ms. Moore in real life, I am sorry for her, but  it is too intimate to write down for the public.  If it is fiction, it goes  too far.  No mother of a seriously ill child would write cynical sentences  about the other mothers in the hospital wearing sweatpants.  So buy her  earlier books, skip this one.	1998-10-11

The author certainly did  enough research to craft such a tale, and in spots the narrative is quite  interesting.  However, the author simply cannot stop trying to wedge this  story into a politically correct fable without any real justification for  doing so and keeps dragging in irrelevant things he admires -- Amnesty  International, pacificists in WWI, etc.  Well, it doesn't work and all this  does is gradually undercut the author's credibility and make the reader  suspicious of the other parts...Too bad, it could have been much better.	1998-10-03

Alas, this man knows not whereof he speaks.  He completely ignores the charm, the fortitude, the stoic endurance and the warm family life of the Khmer people.  He hasn't a single good thing to say for the country, which, for all its problems, has many strong points.  The economy has boomed in the past 3 years, but you wouldn't know it from reading this nonsense.  Kamm's solution?  International takeover of Cambodia (!) though he does not explain whether this will be done by war or other means.  Never mind that this is a sovereign country; the New Yok Times knows best.  Kamm's interviews with leading Cambodian politicians (he does not seem to know any other variety of Cambodian people) evinces an appalling ignorance of the most basic features of Khm! er culture, society and manners of speaking.  He seems to have got most of his erroneous information from hanging out at the FCCC (Foreign Corespondents'Club of Cambodia) with other equally ignorant and tone-deaf journalists and journalist wanna-bes.

I eagerly bought this one in light of my past good experiences and have never been so disappointed.  This is not a finished work; it is a rough outline of a plot with cardboard characters, no motiviation, dull description, etc. that neither the author nor her editors cared enough about to turn into a finished work.  It is also surprisingly poorly written; Lurie is usually a fine stylist.  But, really, what is one to make of sentences like &quot;'Okay,' Lee answered repressively.&quot; (see p. 221).

If you already know Robert Stone (I've read all his books), you'll find this is the best.  If you're not familiar with him, here's a great place to start. His Jerusalem reminds me a lot of Phnom Penh, and I have seen his characters drunk beside the Mekong...	1998-05-04

All the pictures of American soldiers show the Vietnamese cowering away from them, being hurt by them, being horribly wounded, etc. All the pictures of the communist soldiers show them being brave. The written stuff by Halberstam and Sheehan is their same old same old blame America first. And you wonder why I think this book is dishonest and that photojournalists deserve no glory. Take a good look at the close ups of the American GIs, the ones here there faces fill the whole page, and look at the exhaustion and determination and fear and courage mixed in their eyes, and tell me again how great journaists are... And all my veteran friends have had the same reaction to this book...how about ONE picture, just ONE, of a medical aid team helping villagers, a soldier receiving a medal, a picture showing pride...never happen.  I continue to think that this book is selective propaganda for the wrong side and fully deserves the &quot;1&quot; I gave it.	1998-05-04

What a pleasure to make the author's acquantance and learn from him.  He writes insighfully not only about the student takeover but also about Harvard arrogance, the sad individualism of its undergraduates, and its place in American culture.  Though I disagree with his politics, I am most impressed with his wisdom.  Particularly telling are the statements from the faculty members who were refugees from Hitler's Europe and who watched with despair as a new generation of arrogant storm troopers (their words, not mine) began to destroy a fragile institution. Unlike the other reviewer, I was not there.  In April-June 1969, when most of the events in the book occur, I was a first lieutenant serving in Vietnam.  However by September 1969 I had arrived in Cambridge to go to Harvard Law School, and I saw the aftermath of the takeover and the strike at first hand.  The author got the tone exactly right.  Buy this book and read it even if you have absolutely no knowledge of the events described and no interest in them.  You will re-read this book with pleasure and gain much from it.	1998-04-26

One of the few gay authors who can write wittily about gay sex (gay love, actually) without being in-your-face all the time about it.  Does not let his sexuality overwhelm the story line.

US	52978849	R1IN54B89TA5FO	0385477201	938489260	The Other Side of the River	Books	4	2	3	N	Y	okay but flawed	well-written and easy to read, but degenerates into just a series of anecdotes.  Why?  The author has no moral compass and not only admits it, but celebrates it as a liberal virtue.  &quot;Truth depends on what race you are&quot; he expressly says.  This is not only an infinitely sad statement, but also explains why this book has no center and is all frosting and no cake.  Enjoy it skeptically.	1998-02-28

Narcissistic pap.  The authors forget that those who record the activities and work of others are engaged, at best, in a derivative effort.  Far too much attention is paid to these inflated egos already; the lowliest private with a rifle did more for the peoples of Indochina than these Ur-yuppies in pursuit of glamorous careers.  Pass and buy Stewart O'Nan's The Names of the Dead instead.  signed, Vietnam Veteran (1968-69)	1997-11-03
