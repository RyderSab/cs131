This time Alex and his cop pal Milo are tracking down a serial killer who stalks and kills young promising artists.  The mystery is fair, the subplots are necessary to the action, the transitions of different characters are cleaner, and Alex is demonstrating some long-needed maturity. <br /> <br />The ending is abrupt, but not overly so.  Kellerman has been this curt at the end before.  All of the exposition necessary is there -- no plot threads are left hanging. <br /> <br />The major criticism I have is with the detective character Eric Stein.  He's an Army vet who has joined LAPD, and he's a poster boy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but somehow LAPD can't see it, his partner Petra Conner can't see it, Vietnam vet Milo can't see it, even Dr. Delaware the trained shrink can't see it.  Your heo is a psychologist, you figure he ought to recognize classic symptoms when presented.	2005-02-20

From the backstreets of Saint Johnsbury to the \\"multi-purpose room\\" of an elementary school to the deer camps of the Northeast Kingdom, everything rings true and real as a brand new snowmobile in a snowless front yard on Christmas morning.  ((My amazon.com address may be Georgia, but I used to live in White River Jct.)) <br /> <br />The plot is Greek tragedy:  a Vermont State Trooper and his wife have twin daughters killed in a flash flood.  They become foster parents and take in an alienated 10-year-old Black boy, who is tutored about the Buffalo Soldiers (the Negro cavalry of the old West) by the college professor across the street). The trooper has a one-night-stand with a young woman and impregnates her. <br /> <br />Where to begin?  There is no dialogue.  The author writes very well, so this must not be to cover a weakness, but rather just an obnoxious literary technique.  The point-of-view changes with every chapter, from trooper to wife to boy to professor to pregnant girl.  I'll grant the professor and trooper are portrayed well, but I didn't find the wife and pregnant girl convincing, and the boy seemed more like a collection of symptoms from a sociology textbook on foster children than a real flesh-and-blood human being. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have commented on the lame ended of the novel, but if you accept it as Greek tragedy, it works on that level.  The twin daughters are taken away, replaced with a son, a woman is provided to impregnate, the wise of professor gives counsel, the environment is hostile, there are threads of family strife over generations, so you really shouldn't be surprised by a deus ex machina solution and an improbable ending. <br /> <br />The author keeps wanting to say something important about fatherhood. The importance of the father-child relationship impacts of every character in this novel, but the lessons never aeem to be drawn.  It almost begsfor deoconstruction -- is the author showing us a brave new world where fatherhood is obsolete, or is he being ironic, showing what calamity awaits?	2005-01-23

There must be some big, hidden legal, personal, or editorial reason for the terribly awkward structure of this book.  It begins with Joe as a kid, covers hime season-by-season with the Yankees, degenerates into tabloibism from the time Joe met Marilyn until her suicide, and then skips from 1962 to 1989 without any explanation at all.  This is something you just don't see from major authors and major publishers.  What happened? <br /> <br />As is usual from old political reporters writing books (think Halberstam or Woodard) there is no scholarship or authentication.  You simply have to take the author's word that things transpired as they did. Bearing this in mind,nobody should be surprised that Cramer's approach is a hack-job -- but he does that to everybody -- there are no good guys in Cramer's world.

He was breveted a Brigadier General during the War of 1812, his shadow passes across all of the American Army's actions during the first half of the 19th Century, and before retiring he came up with &quot;The Anaconda Plan&quot; as a strategy to win the Civil War.<br />But there is no decent biography of this great historic figure.  And AGENT OF DESTINY falls far short of the mark.<br />Sure, it is meticulously researched.  In fact, it is more researched than written.  Eisenhower wrote SO FAR FROM GOD about the Mexican War; AGENT OF DESTINY seems to be an expansion of that research project.<br />The presentation is very episodic.  They read like they were all written separately, and no real cohesive thread runs through the book.<br />There is just no real sense of proportion.  A Scott court martial is covered in little more than a page, with the juicy details buried in footnotes, and then it goes on forever with the intriguing and fueding for positions.<br />And a critism that applies to much modern military history -- there are way too few maps.	2004-04-04

This is a very good military-style thriller tied to the LEFT-BEHIND series.  Odom writes very convincingly about the U. S. military, and his heroic protagonist, Ranger First Sergeant Sam Adams &quot;Goose&quot; Gander, is an outstanding character.<br />There are several other characters introduced, along with separate sub-plots, and these show lots of potential for the series.  The one about the doubt-filled Navy Chaplain plagued by demons as he tried to spread the word about the Rapture is especially intense.  The one about Goose's wife, a Fort Benning social worker, has potential, but is not well-realized -- every child in the world is raptured away, and they're pressing kidnapping charges about one kid?  Come on.<br />To me, one of the weaknesses of the LEFT BEHIND series is that not enough attention was paid to the Rapture.  And they we see most of it through the eyes of an airline pilot and a newspaper reporter.  <br />The best thing about APOCALYPSE DAWN is that is shows the responses from many different types of ordinary people to this extraordinary event.	2004-04-01

He combines a great number of fascinating anecdotes on Reagan's style and substance, along with &quot;Ten Lessons Ronald Reagan Taught Me&quot;, showing his transition from callow youth to mature adult.<br />This is a fine work of history, biography, and autobriography combined, written in highly readable prose.	2003-12-27

Much of the science is wrong, and was obviously wrong even in 1910. The characters are not shown off to their best adventage -- way too much Mr. \\"Bless my collar buttons\\" Damon, and not enough Eradicate, too little Ned, and too much pilot and sea captain guest characters. Eradicate may be politically incorrect for newer generations, but he's one of the most interesting characters in the series, and he's THERE -- at a time when many Americans pretended that black people did not even exist in fiction.<br />The reprint -- good paper quality, and a good sturdy binding. I wish they'd gone with a smaller typeface and more pages (at a quarter-inch, this just \\"feels\\" to thin). And while they've cleaned up old typographic errors and mis-spellings, they've inserted even more new ones, in a very poor proofreading effort.<br />But it's still TOM SWIFT, you can hold it in your hands and read it, and it's under ten bucks -- and that's not bad.	2003-04-25

Well, at least since before the disastorous THE WEB. Kellerman must know he needs to do something, and this one has a new idea -- it features Milo in individual third-person scenes. And truth to tell, Milo comes off a lot better than Alex, who you really see as annoying and hard-headed.<br />In this one, Alex is sent a book of crime scene photogrpahs. One of them is from Milo's first, still unsolved, case. Milo is still troubled by it. Alex has time on his hands, so they're off on another adventure, involving the old murder, and its massive cover-up by the rich and powerful.<br />Much of the plot, which goes on at least a hundred pages too long (when did they stop editing Kellerman?) revolves around the paranoia of conspiracy and cover-up. If you believe that the execution-style slaying of an LAPD Internal Affairs officer could be concealed to the extent that the LA TIMES wouldn't even mention it, and that even LA cops wouldn't know about it, than maybe this will be OK with you, but rational minds will have a problem with it.<br />The chronology is forced and wrong. This is supposed to be a twenty-year old murder, but if Milo was a young detective three years out of Vietnam, it would have to be closer to thirty.  and the aging problem of series characters has now taken over this series. Milo and Alex have to be pushing 60. Hard to place Alex as a romantic lead anymore; Milo has got to be well past LAPD retirement age for his grade. <br />And is this the kind of book that will bring new readership to the series? Will new readers thrill as Alex does a Google search? Will they hold their breath while Milo searches court records and calls DMV? Will they on be edge of their seat while Alex reads microfilmed newspapers in the library? Will they be cringing as Milo pours maple syrup on chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes.<br />Will please fans more than most recent outings; a great beach book.	2003-04-20

Correa captures the personalities and places, and he has a great gift for language -- the dialogue is perfect.<br />The plot is basically a series of peacetime war stories -- a Scout platoon from the 82nd Airobrne at Fort Bragg deploys to Panama for Jungle School. The nameless narrator recounts the events years later, looking back on the various ways he has messed up his life. The whole thing is as authentic as having the goofy \\"pirate ship\\" Jungle Expert patch sewn on the right pocket of an OD-green permanent press fatigue shirt.<br />You have to hate how the publisher handled the book.

Now Sean is the \\"baddest dude you'll ever see; Airborne Range with a CIB,\\" and the girl lawyer is a specialist in gay military legal defense, so sparks are supposed to fly.<br />But they don't. Sean Drummond is a great character, and he is pretty fully realized -- even after two books, it is easy to see that there are still plenty of unplumbed depths here. But the other characters are stick-figures. Haig's idea of character development is to have somebody be black, or female, or gay, or tall, or \\"typical Army\\". For a real stretch, he may have a character be tall and gay.<br />The plot keeps you turning the pages. Drummond can't just defend a guy on a murder charge, or course; he has to end up saving the entire political-military situation in Northeast Asia with one hand legalistically tied behind his back. As with his previous outing, SECRET SANCTION, it eveually strains our credibility -- an open-and-shut murder case, with all evidence pointing to the accused, suddenly solved by making the assumption, \\"but what if they were ALL in on framing the suspect?\\"<br />But Haig plays fair enough. Even if he isn't always in the realm of the \\"probable\\", it is always \\"plausible\\". Pretty wild and unlikely, but it could happen, and no trotting out of ESP, killer robots, or any other make-believe plot devices we've seen in some recent thrillers. With the compelling first-person narration, I look forward to his next book.	2003-03-09

As a young writer, he was very successful in juvenile fiction, explaining how the world works to teenaged readers.<br />Nowhere is his talent better served nowadays than in his police procedural series.  We look at all levels of the Philadelphia Police Department, from the cop on the beat to the commissioner.<br />The focus is on Matt Payne -- rich kid turned hero homocide sergeant (think Noah Wyle playing Dr. Carter on \\"ER\\").  We get to see him do what he does best -- drive fast, shoot straight, drink hard, catch bad guys, bed babes.<br />As always with Griffin, we get the entire multi-generational cast of inter-related characters -- there's always somebody to identify with, no matter who you are.  Matt's main problem is that he has no real friends -- he has rich acquaintences, more mentors and father surrogates than you can shake a stick at -- but no real friends.  Freindship has always been an underlaying part of all Griffin's books, and it is curiously absent from the heart of the \\"Badge of Honor\\" series.	2003-02-21

How do you take the the exploits of heroic graduates of the United States Military Academy and manage to make it boring?  Author Tom Carhart manages, on a book that features just plain bad writing on so very many different levels.<br />There's the chapter on Henry Flipper, the first African-American USMA grad, which is a warmed over re-write of Carhart doctorial dissertation.<br />There are the chapters on the giants -- Lee, Grant, MacArthur -- which provide only meager details (MacArthur was involved in a Congressional investigation of hazing while a cadet; you'd think that would earn mention in a book titled WEST POINT WARRIORS, but you won't find it here).<br />There's the embarassingly gushing chapter on Colonel &quot;Red&quot; Reeder, with a would-be novelist's attempts at narrative and dialogue.<br />And finally, there's the final two-thirds of the book, which show that there's a lot more to good oral history besides turning on a tape recorder.<br />Top it off with the author parading his own &quot;pet rock&quot; idea (add a graduate school for military history at USMA), and you just have one big thudding blunder of a book.  On the bright side, it did make me want to go back to the teenage section of my local library and find &quot;Red&quot; Reeder's WEST POINT PLEBE to reread.	2002-09-27

And Abrahams is a very good writer -- keen observations, sustained narrative drive, a dead-on sense of place (the Atlanta-area setting and details are at least as good here as Tom Wolfe's A MAN IN FULL; the biggest shock in the book was finding out that Abrahams lives on Cape Cod).<br />But LAST OF THE DIXIE HEROES just falls apart like a house of cards in a slight breeze. Did an editor do anything with it at all, other than spellcheck? Are there any editors anymore? Or is Abrahams too valuable a writer to risk offending by editing his work?<br />The protagonist, Roy Hill, is fully-drawn, and his motivations are real. But none of the other characters breath at all. His wife arbitrarily becomes [promiscuous] after 10 years of marraige. His boss is \\"sharp-dressed, well-spoken Black man\\" from Central Casting, and there's no reason to see why he would take any interest in Roy's career. There's no reason why his best friend from work should even be his friend. The character Lee has a secret which surprised me -- because normally you watch reruns of THE A-TEAM to find plot points this silly.<br />This doesn't even mention the \\"damnyankee\\" bad guys who show up two-third of the way through the book, a climax that is obviously tacked on to fit, and an on again/off again racial angle that twists and turns into nothing.<br />This said, LAST OF THE DIXIE HEROES is a compulsive page-turner. Peter Abrahams, and his readers, have been let down by the editing, or lack there-of. This one needed work done on it.<br />NOTE: My copy was the poorest printing of a mass-market paperback I've ever seen -- four pages totally darkened out, and another eight with very light printing. Of course, if you're not going to spend the $ to edit a book, I guess you're going to be reluctant to remainder damaged copies of the print run as well.	2002-05-28

As Zorro or as the languid Don Diego, our hero is resourceful and witty.  He fights for the oppressed.  Thew soldiers he fights against are honorable and brave, and Zorro respects them, reserving his contempt for their political masters.<br />It is amazing how &quot;politically correct&quot; the original Zorro stories are.

Unfortunately, the authors of The USS ARIZONA weren't up to the task.<br />The survivors stories are fascinating, but never are placed in any context. Very little research or follow-up questioning seems to have been done. Example -- Seaman Rampley joined the ship in February, 1940, and \\"two or three months after Rampley joined -- the Fleet was moved to Hawaii.\\" Well when was it?  This happens throughout the book; all to often not when dealing with 60 year old memories, but when dealing with easily checkable facts.<br />MAJOR DEFECTS: The story of the attack itself gets less than 40 pages of a 269 page book. This must be the only history of December 7th that does not include a map of Pearl Harbor. This is turmpeted as the story of the ship, and simply begs to have a diagram of the battleship, to help the reader place the action. How could an editor have allowed it to go to print without one?<br />My guess is the editor either didn't know, didn't care, or wasn't allowed to do their job. There's no real excuse prose that reads like a first draft, the jarring transitions, and the incredibly long, self-indulgent introduction where the authors inject themselves (in the third-person yet) into the story.<br />One thing I hadn't realized: the vast majority of the ARIZONA survivors were on the beach when the attack happened. Fewer than 100 sailors actually on the ship the morning of December 7th survived.	2002-02-03

S. military.  Ricks carries some baggage -- he not just a reporter, he's with the Washington Post, but Ricks really understands the U. S. armed forces, both inside and outside the Beltway.  These are real soldiers -- this is the way they talk, act, and think.<br />The problem is that this is a first-novel, and it falls apart after 150 superb pages.  Just when you expect the plot to thicken, the Army Chief of Staff and his sharp female aide-de-camp, who have been the protagonists to this point, wander away, and we get some court martial drama involving a very minor character, some hit-man and who's-got-the-computer-disk melodrama, and a deus-ex-machina with a Marine colonel turned dope-smoking hippie.<br />But the Army described there-in is real -- from the defacto segregation of the NCO Clubs to the Pentagon cafeteria full of divorced LTCs -- this is real.  Ricks makes the evil politicans in his novel Republicans (he IS with the Post, after all), but the situations he postulates are not unlikely, given the events of the Clinton administration.	2001-10-28

This pattern is repeated thoughout the book -- we get detailed examinations of Sherman's correspondence and field orders, but combat operations get the short end of the stick. Postwar, we get details on Sherman's banquet qppearances and philandering, but very little on operations against the Indians.<br />A small note: the maps are not helpful in any way.<br />There are lots of good biographies of Sherman, including the general's own memoirs. This one, claiming to focus on Sherman, the soldier, actually does nothing of the sort. It's a well-researched exercise in letters and psycho-history, but it doesn't give you the soldier at all -- false advertising.	2001-08-12

But we are expected to accept Jake as-is -- new readers to the series must find it hard to comprehend.  There is very little back-story.  Series readers know who Toad is; in HONG KONG he's just a voice on the other end of the telephone who gives information to advance the plot.<br />The line between the techno-thriller and science fiction has blurred over recent years.  But I've got to say that when you trot out killer robots, you've gone over the line.<br />All in all, a good, fast read, better than most of what you'll come across, and hopefully the next Jake Grafton novel will find him back in the cockpit.	2001-06-27

The background is authentic and well-researched, and the gunfights, as always, are the best in modern fiction.	2001-06-27

It is well-written and well-researched. The first half is a long tough read -- the early chapters of Davis's military career are good, but the ones on Mississippi and Congressional politics can easily be skipped in order to get to the Civil War quicker. Very good in portraying Davis as a politician travelling the CSA to show his face to the public, discerning statements made to certain newspapers for political purposes, the politics of various appointments. From the military point of view, the author is a Lee man, and an apologist for the various disastorous decision Davis made in the west.	2001-05-23

Rather than taking the  traditional view, that the code came a a result of the repressive attitudes  of the 1950s and was the downfall of the industry, Amy Kiste Nyborg  convincingly shows the Code to be a pioneering effort in industry  self-regulation in response to public pressure -- a logical forerunner of  motion picture ratings, recoard warning labels, TV advisories, and the  V-chip.  Parental and community outcry against commic books in the 1940s  and 1950s virtually mirrors the &quot;protect our kids from the  Internet&quot; efforts of 1998.  The unexamined role of economic factors  such as industry distribution patterns on the Code is examined here for the  first time.  The Comics code is shown to have made fundamental changes in  how the comics industry has operated over time, and in SEAL OF APPROVAL,  Amy Kiste Nyborg demonstrates that it is still very relevant today.	1998-08-26
