I particularly enjoyed Fortunes Rocks.  I was therefore greatly disapointed in Light On Snow.  Indeed, in looking through many of the other reviews, I noticed that the word \\"disappointed\\" kept coming up time and time again.  I guess that word just sums it all up. <br /> <br />The book is painstakingly slow - indeed, there were times when I was reading it when I kept thinking, \\"Is this some kind of joke?  Could a book possibly be this painful to read?\\"   <br /> <br />Virtually nothing ever happens here, and you never learn enough about the characters to care very much about them.  Indeed, until I read some of the other reviews I totally forgot that the book was written by an adult looking back on her 12th winter.  The book just wasn't memorable at all. <br /> <br />I am glad that I took this one out of the library!  Anita, let's move on from this nightmare and try try again.	2005-01-15

Other than \\"OneL,\\" which I enjoyed because I was just starting law school, I have not enjoyed any of his other books.  I couldn't get into \\"Burden of Proof,\\" and stopped after just a few chapters.  Then I was tortured and tormented through \\"Personal Injuries,\\" which I finished reading for reasons unknown.  It was truly awful.  And now, \\"Reversible Errors.\\"  I never would have chosen this book for myself - my book club picked it as our next selection, thinking that perhaps it would lead to a spirited discussion of the death penalty.  After reading it, I doubt it can create a spirited discussion of any topic, other than disliking Scott Turow.  <br />This book is boring and lifeless.  I didn't care one bit about Rommy Gandolph, nor any of the other characters.  And I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did.  The only reason I finished it is so I could discuss it at the book club.  I sat here and read all of the positive reviews on Amazon and simply had to shake my head in disbelief.  What is it I am missing?  How could anyone find this novel compelling?	2003-02-17

I agree 100% with the reviewer who said that this book had a good premise, but turned out to be unbearably stupid.  Several times during the course of reading this book I was ready to throw it across the room in frustration.  I mean, it was just so SILLY.  The two main characters, Barry and Maureen, have more than enough evidence that some MAJOR EVIL is going on here, yet they still talk about it as though it is a normal situation with normal solutions possible.  For example, if you knew that people were breaking into your house in the middle of the night while you were in the other room sleeping, if you knew that they poisoned your pet (and also some children), if you knew that they secretly videotaped you in the bedroom and in the bathroom, if your friends suddenly disappeared without a trace, if there was a \\"Stumpy\\" or two writhing around in the woods, would your reaction be to say, \\"Hey, let's attend the next homeowners' association meeting and see if we can vote against the board\\"????<br />I mean, the book is just too silly for words.  So many situations were totally implausible.  Why in the world would Maureen have agreed to spend the night alone in that house with all the weird and scary things that had been happening?  Why in the world did no one try to bring in police from outside the town of Corban?  And, incidentally, what was the deal with that FBI agent?  He said that he \\"wouldn't live anywhere else\\" but a community that had a homeowners' association, with the implication being what?  That Bonita Vista was only one of several of these types of wacky communities?  Reminded me a bit of the movie \\"The Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" for some reason!<br />Finally, I too was annoyed by the reference to \\"that jackass William Rehnquist.\\"  Bentley, keep your political views to yourself, please.  They didn't belong in here.  I get enough of that reading the New York Post.	2002-05-26

I just found that there wasn't much plot to hold my interest.<br />The ending too was unbelievable and senseless.  Without revealing too much, the book seems to suggest that someone who had been a murderer throughout the book would somehow prove to be the &quot;savior&quot; of one of the other characters at the end!  Outrageously ridiculous!  And it actually made me angry.  <br />I think this will be my first and last Linda Howard novel.

This book made absolutely no sense, never answered any of the questions that it posed, and was completely unsatisfying.  In the beginning of the book there is a woman who was apparently sexually abused by a group of boys.  And this is on the same night that Marianne was raped?  (Or, at least I think she was raped, the book was not 100% clear on that either).  The girl who was sexually abused is never mentioned again.  What was her point in the story?  I read through the entire book thinking that at some point there would be a &quot;pay off.&quot;  An explanation, a glimmer of understanding.  Nothing!  I read this book for days longer than I wanted to because I wanted to find out what was going to happen at the end.  Well, guess what.  *Nothing* happens.  I want those days back so I can spend them reading another book!  A good book.  LOL.    <br />I don't want to give the ending of the book away so I will stop here.  Not that there really is an &quot;ending&quot; in the true sense of the word.  The author just got sick of writing (finally!) and gave up.  Thank goodness, now I can move on to something enjoyable.  This was my first book by this author, and also my last.	2001-05-11

I was disappointed because I had already read Lamb's &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot; and loved it.  <br />Anyway, one day I finished reading a different book and was in the mood to start another.  I couldn't get to the library or book store until the next day, but I really was in the mood to sit down and read.  (I read at least a little bit every day).  In desperation, I took &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; out of the drawer where it had been abandoned.  I certainly didn't expect much.  I started reading it, and - lo and behold - I just loved it!  I have no idea why I didn't like it the first time around!  This time I found it funny, sad, insightful, interesting . . . simply a great read.  I would highly recommend this book.  Wally Lamb, you are one hell of a writer.  Can't wait until you come out with a new one!<br />(I think I liked &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot; a little bit better than this one.

I had to laugh when I read the beginning of this book.  Lucy is talking about all the &quot;yummy&quot; men that she sees at ball games, or friends of her husband, etc. etc.  How their mere touch drives her crazy, how she  wants to &quot;sleep with them all.&quot;  Uh...excuse me, but what planet  does Lucy live on?  I can walk around a mall all day and not see a guy I  even want to go out on a date with, let alone one that drives me wild with  desire!<br />Anyway, the book focuses a lot on how good-looking everyone is.   Kate is a gorgeous model, Chip is a hunk lawyer (hey, I'm a lawyer, how  come I never see those kind of guys where I work?)  Lucy is pretty, Max is  almost as handsome as Chip, according to Lucy.  And there were some other  striking people in the book - I forget who.<br />But, on to the rest of the  book.  First of all, I don't know why Lucy had to tell everyone about her  fling with Chip.  There were many more discreet ways she could have handled  the whole blood test thing.  Also, when Max was berating her so badly for  her fling with Chip - how come Lucy doesn't even mention the fact that at  right around the same time she walked into her husband's office and caught  him with his arms around another woman (beautiful, of course, as everyone  is in this town).  I mean, she never mentioned it again, even when Max was  coming down on her so badly.  Yes, I know what Lucy did was  &quot;worse&quot; because she did it with one of their friends.   Nevertheless, Max was far from blameless.  And then, when Max and Kate  start sleeping together - again Lucy says nothing!  Oh how ridiculous!<br />It  was sad when Jeremy got sick, but an interesting discussion  could have  been more fully explored.  If Lucy and Chip hadn't had sex, Jeremy wouldn't  have had cystic fibrosis.  But, then again, without Chip, there would have  been no Jeremy.  Lucy and Max would have made a different child.  Oh well,  you get the idea.<br />All in all, the book wasn't bad.  Justdidn't ring true  to me.	2000-07-30

I enjoyed the book so much that I found myself carrying it around with me in my purse so I could read it at odd moments - on line in the department store, for example!  I wanted to  finish the book yet I never wanted it to end.  This was truly a great first  novel and I look forward to her next book(s).<br />Was I the only one who  thought, at first, that the dead teenager had been killed by Mr. Robertson?   That would have been a more sensationalistic ending, of course, and  perhaps the book was better this way.  But it seemed to me that it could  have been an interesting concept -  that Robertson was a killer, so perhaps  he really did like Amy just a little bit because he didn't kill her.  And -  by the way - do other people think that Robertson was the one who made the  obscene phone call?  Robertson was an incredibly vile character.  <br />The  Robertson character, at first, reminded me a little bit of the older  seducer in Anita Shreve's latest book, Fortune's Rocks (which I also  enjoyed, by the way), although the character in Shreve's novel had a lot  more redeeming qualities than Robertson.<br />The scene with the hair cutting  was terrific.  It actually made me say &quot;oh my god&quot; out loud in  the fast food restaurant where I was eating my chicken sandwich.  People  must have thought I was a bit strange.  After so much description of how  beautiful her hair was you wanted to reach a hand out and grab Isabelle -  say no, no, don't do it.<br />One more thing - don't you think Evelyn  Cunningham was just a little bit too nice to Isabelle?<br />Great book, highly  recommended.	2000-06-26

This book was not overly-long, page-wise, but it felt that way to me.  As a matter of fact, towards the end of the book, I  actually started skimming which is something that I *never* do.<br />The main  character was extremely unlikeable and I didn't like him any better after  he betrayed his client by giving locks of the dead girls' hair to the old  woman for her to turn into the police.  (Sorry, I am a lawyer and have no  tolerance for such things.  I am not a criminal lawyer, and never could be  because I wouldn't want to defend people I believed to be guilty.  But,  once undertaking their representation, however, I would not betray them as  it is professionally unethical).<br />I also had no feeling whatsoever for the  accused killer.  He didn't inspire fear, or loathing, or sympathy, or much  of anything.  I kept waiting for something to happen with his character,  and nothing ever did.<br />The author's style reminded me a little bit of  Nelson DeMille.  That is - the somewhat-unsympathetic main male character  with a sarcastic sense of humor.

As a matter of fact, it was the Weight of Water which  caused me to give Anita Shreve another try.  And I am very glad that I  did.<br />I found Fortune's Rocks to be touching and a real page-turner.   Olympia and Haskell were not all that sympathetic, of course.  They were  selfish and self-centered, and did some truly terrible things.  Yet there  is something about all that passion that is very intoxicating!<br />This book  reminded me very much of a book called Emmeline by Judith Rosner.  In  Emmeline, a girl goes to work in some type of factory (I forget what kind)  and falls in love with an older married man.  Emmeline ends up getting  pregnant by this man, and he betrays her.  I thoroughly recommend that book  as well, by the way.

Everyone seems to love it so much!  Personally, I found this book to be slow-moving and a little boring.  Only toward the end did it begin to  get my interest.  It took me many weeks to finish this book because I just  wasn't motivated to keep reading it.  If I had taken it out of the library,  I would have returned it unfinished.  Because I had purchased it, I stuck  with it until the end.<br />I feel there were many aspects of the relationship  between Jack and Benny which could have been more thoroughly and  interestingly explored.  They never really explain how Jack is feeling or  why.  It just seems that, at one point, he invites all these women to his  home because he can't decide who should be his date, and then, all of a  sudden, he is &quot;in love&quot; with Benny.  There is very little  dialogue between these two characters - no real sense as to why Benny and  Jack are in love.  <br />Also, I never quite understood the Simon Westward  character.  Did he have money or didn't he?  Nan seemed to want him for his  money, but then at other times in the book it says that he had  none.<br />Well, I enjoyed Tara Road (my first Maeve Binchy novel) a lot more  than this one.

It was my first Maeve Binchy novel, and I think that perhaps I will now read another one.  Some things in the book were rather predictable, however.   For example, as another reviewer noted, it was certainly no surprise that  Danny was Rosemary's &quot;mysterious&quot; lover.<br />One odd thing - on the  dust jacket it says that Ria finds herself missing Colm more and more while  she is away living in Marilyn's house.  Excuse me, but did I miss  something?  It didn't seem to me that Ria thought very much (if at all)  about Colm while she was in the United States.

I have read a few of Koontz's novels and never had any particularly strong feelings either way.  (Although I listened to the audio version of Intensity and just loved it!) <br />But, False Memory was  thoroughly entertaining and Dr. Ahriman was a terrific villain.  He  reminded me a bit of Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, in the way  that he looked down his nose at people with more plebian tastes than his  own in food, decor, etc.  A snobby serial killer, such fun!  (Along the  same lines, he was also a bit like Patrick Bateman in American  Psycho.)<br />It was intriguing to think of how *good* Ahriman's techniques  could have been if they were used to *treat* troubled people, rather than  create them.  Just as he implanted phobias in psychologically healthy  people, he could have removed them in troubled people.  Of course, this  would raise all kinds of ethical concerns about the dangers of  &quot;programming&quot; the human mind, etc.  But I am wandering off the  topic...<br />I found False Memory to be an exciting book.  I looked forward  to reading it each day, and would definitely recommend it to friends.   Sometimes the writing was a bit corny (&quot;turn more heads than a  chiropractor&quot;-type stuff), but all in all it was a lot of fun.<br />Oh, a  brief P.S. - I once read a book about super-intelligent children who were  lured to a special school where their brains were transplanted into jars.   Was this Koontz?  I cannot remember the name of the book or who wrote it.   Or, did I just dream the whole thing?  Maybe someone can e-mail me with the  answer?  Thanks.	2000-02-07

I read it when I was rather young (a teenager?) and have re-read portions of it many times since.<br />The book particularly grabbed me because my mother was always very  over-protective and always made me tell her where I was at every minute of  the day.  Uni, the computer in the book that made you scan where you were  at all times, reminded me of her.  I related to Chip's discomfort when he  first deliberately passed a scanner without touching it.  &quot;Uni doesn't  know where I am!&quot; he thought.  I too, at that time, felt discomfort  when I didn't &quot;touch the scanner&quot; (i.e., call my mom).      :)<br />The book had many wonderful touches and insights.  I have never  forgotten it.  It really should have been made into a movie.  Fight Uni!	2000-01-19

I was determined to finish, however, because I am stubborn and because I wanted to see how it all  ended.  I shouldn't have wasted my time.  This was a suprisingly bad book  and one that I'll bet would never have been published if it didn't have the  name &quot;Scott Turow&quot; attached to it.  (Truthfully, the only book by  Turow that I really enjoyed was &quot;One L.&quot;  Probably because I was  just starting law school when I read it.)<br />     One of the reasons I think  the book was so bad was the technique of having it narrated by &quot;George  Mason&quot; - a totally uninteresting character.  We never care a whit  about him, and he fails to make us care about Feavor or Evon or anyone  else.  (Oh, and those names!   &quot;Favor&quot; and &quot;Even&quot; -  give me a break - it was driving me crazy throughout the whole book).   Turow should not use this technique again.  Then again, I don't really care  because I doubt I will ever again read another one of his books.	2000-01-06

Never have I seen such a blatant attempt to &quot;force&quot; a sequel!  I mean, Frank is on the boat, he's coming to America, and  then....that's it!  What sort of a denouement is that!  None!  It's as if  Frank McCourt said, &quot;OK, now you have to buy my next book!&quot;<br />Two  other comments/questions: 1)  How in the world was Angela able to afford  Frank's dancing lessons when her children were dying of  starvation/malnutrition? 2)  Why is the book called Angela's Ashes?  (Does  anyone know?  Has the author ever said?)	1999-10-20

I actually had never heard of it before and took it out of the library on a whim.  Boy, am I glad I did.<br />While reading the book I kept  telling everyone how much I was enjoying it, but I also kept saying that I  would &quot;reserve judgment&quot; until the book was completed.  Why?   Because so many books I have read lately have been enjoyable much of the  way through, followed by an ending that was a real let-down.  For example,  &quot;Hunting Down Amanda&quot; was interesting and fast-paced throughout  most of the story, and then came to a hasty, unresolved, and unsatisfying  ending.  I also felt the same way about &quot;The General's Daughter&quot;  by Nelson DeMille.<br />But I found The Drowning People to be &quot;good to  the last drop.&quot;  To all those reviewers who didn't enjoy the book and  said that the plot and ending were &quot;predictable&quot; - you are far  better detectives than I!  I didn't guess the ending - the reason why Sarah  was murdered - until about 25 pages or so from the end.  Then it all hit me  in a flood of realization.  And my mouth hung open for a moment.   &quot;Wow,&quot; I thought, &quot;maybe she really did deserve to  die.&quot;  What an incredible thought!  *Did* she deserve to die?  And how  blameworthy was James for taking the matter into his own hands?  So much to  think about.  <br />I think Richard Mason is a superb writer, particularly so  because of his age.  I am very much looking forward to his next book.  Keep  up the good work, Richard.	1999-09-23
