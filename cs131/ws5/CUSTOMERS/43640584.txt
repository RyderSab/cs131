It is believed that the boy was kidnapped by members of a mysterious cult that lives nearby; however, the Hardys aren't so sure.  Their investigation leads them to the remote timberlands of New Brunswick in Canada where they come face-to-face with a mad scientist who calls himself the Devil.  This was a fairly good book.  The story is interesting and is well-paced.  The author obviously put some thought into the plot and setting; however, he still made some minor geographical mistakes (for example, it is Saint John, New Brunswick, not St. John).  I must admit though that I'm tired of seeing that every time the Hardy's go to Canada, EVERY Canadian that they meet is French.  Despite my complaining, I did enjoy the book and I feel that most fans of the series would as well.	2005-05-01

Clues lead the boys to being secretly trapped on board a freighter bound for Atlantic Island in the Bahamas, where they make an incredible discovery in a mad scientist's laboratory.  The title of the book is rather misleading because, even though the boys are trapped at sea twice during the course of the book, it is never for more than a couple of chapters.  Despite this, this was a fairly good book.  I've never been a huge fan of the doom-and-gloom, world-domination type plots featured in many of the paperback editions, but this story was fairly interesting and moved along at a good pace.  This was a worthwhile read, which I think that most fans of the series, particularly the younger ones, would enjoy.	2005-05-01

Also, a world-renowned spy wishes to defect to the U.S., but the terrorist organization that he works for will do anything to stop him.  I thought that the plot of this book was rather interesting; however, I didn't find that the book had that much action.  I would expect a book featuring a terrorist group to be loaded with action, but this really wasn't.  A lot of the chapter cliffhangers I found to be dull.  I understand that this book is meant for young readers and, as such, the amount of violence should be kept to a minimum while still having the book be exciting.  I'm not saying that there isn't any action in it, but I think that there could have been more.	2004-11-30

Nancy discovers a coded message woven into the rug.  The message instructs Mr. Drew to bring Farouk's mannequin to Istanbul and Nancy tries to learn what became of the mannequin after Farouk closed his shop in River Heights.  I didn't find the mystery in this book terribly exciting and there really wasn't much action or suspence either.  Toward the end of the book, when Nancy and her friends go to Istanbul and the book should be coming to a climax, what do they do?  They go sightseeing and the book turns into a tour guide with about one chapter left.  There is a different twist at the end of the book, but if you paid enough attention when reading the book and didn't fall asleep you could probably figure that out anyway.  This isn't one of the absolute worst books of the series, but it isn't far from it.	2003-10-12

While there they tour Lima, the Lake Nahuel Huapi region of Argentina, the old city of Cuzco, the ancient Incan city of Machu Picchu and the Nascan Lines.  Oh yeah, there may have also been something about a mystery concerning a crossword cipher, but that only got in the way of all of the exciting things that happened when the girls were touring.  Things like having paint or other things thrown at them, falling down on numerous occasions and receiving warnings, warnings and more warnings.  At one point, the cipher is stolen from Nancy's hotel room and the summary at the beginning of the book says that \\"the daring young detective's ability to think fast and act quickly results in the recover of the plaque\\".  Nancy finds the plaque because she is told where it is; I imagine it must have taken a lot of brain power to figure that one out.  So for all you children planning a trip to South America, buy this book to learn what sites to see.  For the other 99.9999% of the population, avoid this book like the plague, it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.	2003-10-12

First, a wealthy financier, Monsieur Leblanc, has been frightened into selling large amounts of stocks and bonds and Mr. Drew has been hired by some Leblanc's associates to discover what has frightened the man so much.  Second, Nancy has been asked by a Frenchwoman living in River Heights to unlock the secret of a dream she keeps having where she is blindfolded and about to fall down a flight of steps with someone whispering \\"99 steps\\".  The dream actually happened to the woman when she was a child growing up in France, but she doesn't remember where the 99 steps are located.  This is another tour guide with Nancy and her friends going to Notre Dame, the Louvre, Versailles and stopping in Orleans to learn about Joan Of Arc.  Somewhere amongst all of this touring, Nancy manages to find time to solve the mystery; unfortunately, it's not before the book manages to bore you to tears.  The mystery is pathetic and dull and the book has very little suspence and action.  I'm getting bored just thinking about the book as I write this review.  Don't waste your time on this book, it's not worth it.	2003-10-11

Also, Nancy investigates a gang that is stealing sheep.  This is one of the dumbest written books in this series.  To start with, Bess submits a photo of Nancy, with a magnifying glass looking at some footprints, to a photography magazine contest and wins first prize.  Please!  Out of all of the entries that would be received for this type of contest a picture of Nancy wins first prize.  You've got to be joking.  Second, the winning photo gets published in the magazine and for the rest of the book, people, not only in the River Heights, but in Scotland as well, are recognizing Nancy from the photo.  Come on!  This is a photography magazine.  Only people seriously interested in photography would be seeing this picture, not the whole world.  Also, the heirloom that Nancy was supposed to receive was her great-grandmother's most prized possession, if that's the case why wouldn't the great-grandmother give it to someone to whom she is closer, instead of Nancy whom she's never met.  It makes no sense.  If Nancy has been able to fly off everwhere else, why hasn't she been able to see her great-grandmother before this.  The mystery is just boring and unsuspenceful and comes complete with the usual \\"exciting\\" warning received by the end of the second chapter.  Anyone with half a brain could have written this piece of trash.  It's a waste of time.	2003-10-11

The search eventually leads the girls to Hong Kong.  Mr. Drew accompanies them because his case also has ties to Hong Kong and if that weren't enough of a ridiculous coincidence already, Ned Nickerson is studying in Hong Kong at the same time.  To be quite honest this book didn't interest me very much.  I found the plot boring and unoriginal and there was little action.  In the book, the criminals threaten to put a bomb on the plane if Nancy and her friends fly to Hong Kong.  So what does Nancy do?  She uses a ruse and hopes that the criminals believe that she is not making the trip and then the girls board the plane potentially putting the lives of numerous innocent people at risk.  Talk about selfish!!!  Couldn't she have at least driven to another city and flown out of there.  I wouldn't say that this is one of the ten worst books of the series, but it's pretty close.	2003-09-28

The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery.  It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals.  When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people.  Lots of suspense there.  This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants.  This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating.	2003-09-24

Personally, I didn't find the mystery in this book to be all that exciting, the puppet wasn't spooky at all and there wasn't much action to be found.  The end of the book wasn't very good as the main criminals are arrested well before the book ends and this happens in a typically boring Nancy Drew fashion.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the book as well written as it was; it certainly is not classic literature, but it was a step up from the atrocious writing found in most of the high (from #35 up) Nancy Drew books.  The characters were well-defined and actually had personality, unlike in a lot of the books of the series, where the characters are either good or bad.  Isn't wasn't the most exciting book, but at least when I finished it I hadn't felt as though I had just wasted my time.	2003-09-20

Nacy investigates a woman named Mitzi Channing who is selling stolen furs and worthless stock to people.  I don't know why the author titled this book \\"Mystery At The Ski Jump\\" because skiing and ski jumps have next to nothing to do with the mystery.  The mystery is alright, but there isn't much action or suspence.  The ending of the book is not bad, but it's another one of those boring \\"Nancy has nothing to do with actually capturing the criminals and only hears about it after the fact\\" endings.  This is not a book that I'd strongly recommend.	2003-09-14

Now the Fontaines are being threatened and fear for their lives.  Nancy is determined to find to find out who is threatening the Fontaines and why.  This book is alright.  The mystery is okay and there is a bit of action.  One thing that I did enjoy about the book was that at the end, Nancy participated in capturing the criminals.  She may not have physically done it, but at least she was present, unlike in so many of the books were you get an ending like \\"As Nancy arrived the police were putting handcuffs on so-and-so\\" or \\"Two hours later the police called and said that the suspects had been arrested\\".  How exciting is that?  It's not!!!  The book could have been a little more exciting, however, and it never really held my attention throughout.

The summary at the beginning of the book makes it sound like it will a very interesting book, but it's not.  The mystery is something anyone could have created, the house is not exciting, there is very little action and no suspence.  In the end, Nancy can't even capture the owner of the house.  I won't spoil the \\"exciting\\" ending, so let's just say that he is unavailable for capturing.  It all made for a boring ending to a boring book.  Boring!  Boring!  Boring!!!

This book was alright, it's not one of the best of the series, but it certainly isn't one of the worst.  The mystery is okay and there is a reasonable amount of action.

A friend of Mr. Drew's from Boston, Capt. Easterly, is hoping to buy the ship on which he is currently living.  However, the owner doesn't have a clear title to the ship and is unable to sell it.  Capt. Easterly asks Mr. Drew to look into the matter since no record of the previous owners can be found.  Also, mysterious prowlers have been on board the ship, apparently looking for something.  Nancy, Mr. Drew and, later, Bess and George go to Boston to help solve the mysteries.  This book is alright, it is written fairly well, the mystery is somewhat interesting and there is some action.  However, it is not among my favorite books of the series.  I found that many times it was by random circumstance that Nancy picked up important clues.  For example, they take the boat out of Boston Harbor and sail to an arbitrarily picked cove.  While in a village on the cove, Nancy gets important clues to the real name of the ship and to the location of its lost figurehead.  The book is worth reading, but I don't think that too many fans will count this one among their top 5 favorites.	2003-09-06

In typical fashion, both mysteries which originate on another continent are tied to the exact place in Africa where Nancy is going.  If someone can find even the smallest shred of something to enjoy in this book, I wish they would let me know because I couldn't find anything in it that I thought was good.

Nancy sets out to investigate the mysterious woman, but soon is faced with numerous other mysteries, including a vacation scam perpetrated by a woman who bears a resemblance to Nancy; the search for an old carriage, sealed in a box and sunk in the bay many years ago; and a strange green-glowing wizard that lives on a nearby mountain.  This wasn't a bad book and it is easily one of the better books from #35 up (most of which are garbage).  Nancy has many mysteries to solve and they are fairly interesting.  The book has a not bad amount of action and it isn't as poorly written as some of the other books put out at that time.  One thing that I didn't care for with this book, was that Nancy resembled the woman involved in the vacation scam.  This is a tired plot device that has been featured more than once in this series.  Generally, I did enjoy this book; it wasn't one of the most exciting books I've ever read, but I would recommend reading it.	2003-08-21

While at a concert, Nancy witnesses a man stealing a woman's purse.  She chases the thief, but only manages to recover the purse, not it's contents.  Nancy befriends the owner of the purse and the woman offers Nancy a mystery to solve.  Nancy is to locate the gypsy father of the woman's granddaughter, Rose; the man apparently abandoned his wife and Rose when she was 8 years old.  As well, Nancy is to search for a doll which, on her deathbed, Rose's mother hinted contained a secret concerning Rose.  I found this book to be alright.  It was fairly well-written and has a moderate amount of action.  The plot is interesting, but not terribly exciting.  One thing which truely disappointed me about the book was the ending.  Most of it is fine; however, everything is wrapped up much to quickly and uneventfully.  Everything goes from doom-and-gloom to sunshine-and-roses (no pun intended) in a matter of one short, boring paragraph as the police just happen to come along and round all of the bad guys up.  Unfortunately, this is the case with most Nancy Drew books and particularly the later editions.

Personally, I didn't find this book to be very good; although, it is not really bad.  There isn't much action in the book and the mystery isn't overly exciting.  In fact, by the time you get through the silly shenanigans concerning the girls being chased on their way to New Orleans by a man who stole Nancy's old car and the obligatory tour guide through New Orleans and actually get into the mystery, the book is already 1/3 over.

The girl went to live with her other grandmother in the town of Deep River after the deaths of her parents when she was a baby. However, the grandmother died shortly after that and all trace of the girl has been lost. When the girls arrive in Deep River they see Moonstone Castle in the distance and decide to explore it. This was a very boring book with a dull mystery and almost zero action. The summary in the book suggests that the castle is haunted, but that is never really mentioned in the book itself.  Nancy doesn't do any brilliant detective work to find the missing girl, instead she basically stumbles upon her.  I'd only recommend getting this book to complete your set.	2003-07-26

Later, the plane disappears as well, along with a pony from the ranch and Nancy works to solve both mysteries.  Also, Bess is faced with a tough situation when she becomes interested in a cowboy from the ranch.  This is one of the better of the higher volumes; although, that isn't saying much since practically all of the books from 35 up are garbage. The mystery in this one isn't too bad and their is a moderate amount of action in the book.  Thankfully, the girls don't go to an actual place so the book doesn't read like a tour guide.  I liked the part about Bess' dilemma.  Though it wasn't thrilling reading, I found that it made the characters seem more real.  I would say that this book is worth reading, but just once.

Nancy is approached by a young college professor who tells her about a treasure that he and some other professors were searching for in Mexico.  They had found a stone tablet which they believed would help them locate the treasure, but before they could translate it, the tablet vanished along with one of the professors.  Did he steal the tablet or was he kidnapped?  Nancy is asked to help find the missing professor and the tablet and to guard a valuable, black, half key which together with another 2 1/2 similar keys would unlock the treasure.  This is probably one of the 10 best Nancy Drew books.  The mystery, though a little implausible, is quite interesting.  The book has a lot of action and suspence and was well-written.  I was hooked from beginning to end.  This is a very good book and every Nancy Drew fan should have this one in their collection.	2003-07-20

This review concerns the original 1936 edition and the revised 1974 edition which is slightly different from the original but basically tells the same story.  Nancy meets a young Indian boy (named Coya in the original, Rishi in the revised) who lives with a circus.  The boy is being mistreated by a man named Rai who claims to be the boy's father, but Nancy doubts this claim.  Nancy saves Rai from an elephant and to show his thanks he gives Nancy an ivory, elephant charm which he says can protect the wearer from harm.  Coya/Rishi runs away from the circus and Rai and the Drews take him in.  Later, Rai changes his mind and wants the charm back and he will do anything to get both the charm and Coya/Rishi.  Also figuring into this \\"mystery\\" are a strange woman and a bizarre house out in the middle of the woods.  The house, apparently, has no floor, but it does have a secret passage and a bunch of swings and trapezes hanging from the ceiling.  This book was just plain awful!!  The mystery, what there is of one, is stupid and boring.  The house serves absolutely no purpose other than to use up pages and it makes no sense.  Who would build a house like that out in the middle of nowhere?  The strange woman in the book is more annoying than anything and comes off as too scatterbrained and weak-minded to be the great criminal mastermind that the plot requires her to be.  The book has little in the way of action or suspence.  This book is just bad, bad, bad!  Take my advice and don't read it.	2003-07-20

Nancy meets an elderly lady, Mrs. Alexandra, who was formerly a queen in a European country.  When a revolution erupted in the country, the woman's entire family perished except for her grandson who was brought to America by his nurse.  When Mrs. Alexandra escaped to America, she was never able to find her grandson and hopes that Nancy could locate him for her.  Also, pickpockets are at work in River Heights.  To anyone that just read my summary of the book and thinks that it will be boring, don't let that stop you from reading this book; it is actually a fairly decent book.  I liked the fact that through the course of the book, Nancy was fooled and used many times by the criminals to get away with their crimes, it made her seem more human and not like the SuperNancy we see in many of the books.  However, in the end her intelligence and intuition won out over the criminals.  I particularly thought that it was clever the way in which the pickpockets managed to fool Nancy.  The book has a moderate amount of action, is written well and I found that for the most part it held my interest all the way through.  I think that most Nancy Drew fans would enjoy reading it.	2003-07-20

Bess' cousin Dick asks for Nancy's help when a valuable, old, oriental vase that was on display is stolen from his pottery shop.  He also tells Nancy about a pit of china clay that is supposed to be located somewhere around River Heights near a leaning chimney.  The clay is used in making fine pottery and could make Dick wealthy if he could find it.  Finally, the owner of the stolen vase, Mr. Soong, seeks Nancy's help in finding his missing friend and the man's daughter, who came to America a few years previous, but disappeared before they arrived at Mr. Soong's.  This is certainly one of the more interesting books of the Nancy Drew series.  The book quickly grabbed my attention and managed to hold it until the final page, which I can really only say happened with about 1/3 of the books in the series.  There is quite a bit of action in the book and the writing is very good, at least in the original edition; unfortunately, in most of the revised editions the writing has been dumbed down.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end and I think that most Nancy Drew fans would place this one on their Best Of the Series lists.	2003-07-19

Desperately wanting to help a poor little girl and her sick mother, Nancy races against time to locate the woman's missing sister.  The missing woman, named Florianna in the original version and Julianna in the revised edition, was a talented dancer who disappeared many years before while engaged to a wealthy businessman.  Before the man died, he willed to Florianna/Julianna his large estate, Heath Castle, with the stipulation that if she doesn't come forward to claim the estate within a certain amount of time, it is to be turned over to the county for a park.  Nancy now has only three weeks to find the missing heiress, but her efforts are being thwarted by a group of men who have apparently been searching the now overgrown estate looking for something.  This book is easily one of the ten best of the set, at least the original version is, I never read the revised edition and, although the books tell the same story, the revised editions lack the vibrant writing which characterizes many of the originals. The mystery is interesting and the book moves along at a good pace.  I particularly enjoyed the book from about pages 70-100 in the original volume.  At this point, Nancy, Bess and George have gone to Heath Castle to investigate, they become separated and each one has her own adventure.  This is an excellent book and a definate must-read for fans of Nancy Drew.	2003-07-06

Nancy, Bess, George and Mr. Drew are staying at Deer Mountain Hotel/Lodge because Mr. Drew is working on a case concerning jewel thieves.  He asks Nancy's help to look for a woman suspected of being a member of the gang and who is supposed to be in the vicinity of the hotel.  The only clue to her identity is that she carries an expensive jewel case with the picture of a child in it (really now, like people are going to notice her jewel case and that it has a child's picture, but not be able to give even the slightest bit of a physical description of the woman, like her hair color????).  Nancy also hears a story about a haunted bridge in the woods near the hotel and she enters a golf tournament.  Zzzzzzzzz.  This has to be one of the most inappropriately titled books in the series.  There is a \\"haunted\\" bridge, but Nancy discovers the truth behind it on page 42 (in the original edition)!  The book isn't 1/4 over at that point.  What does the bridge really have to do with the rest of the mystery?  The whole golf tournament part is rather boring and unsuspenseful.  I'm not giving away some big secret by telling you that Nancy wins.  Nancy always wins or is the best at everything she does.  Frankly, I find it rather annoying. Just once I'd like to see Nancy be just alright at doing something or have Bess or George be better than her at something.  The book isn't a complete waste of time, the mystery concerning the jewel thieves isn't that bad and kept me somewhat interested.  This wasn't one of my favorites, but it was worth reading; although, anyone who reads it expecting a story about ghosts is going to be let down.	2003-07-06

In the original version, Nancy, Bess and George are going to the coastal town of Seacliff with Mr. Drew who has business there.  Before leaving, Nancy meets a woman who tells her about a statue of a whispering woman which is on the grounds of an abandoned estate near Seacliff.  The woman tells Nancy that Nancy resembles the statue.  Also, on the train to Seacliff, Nancy meets a woman who she fears is going to be swindled by a man she just met on the train.  Nancy tries to help the woman, but she basically tells Nancy to mind her own business.  Nancy being Nancy, decides to try to help the woman anyway.  As well, Nancy gets her stupid dog, Togo, who is a complete nuisance throughout the book.  In the revised edition, Nancy is asked for help from a woman who suspects that she is being swindled by a man she commissioned to sell some rare old books for her.  She believes that the man is only giving her a small fraction of what he is actually getting for the books.  In order to investigate, Nancy, Bess and George travel to Waterford where Nancy uses the alias Debbie Lynbrook and gets a job in the bookstore of the suspected swindler.  There is also a side mystery concerning a stolen whispering statue.  Personally, I didn't find either version very good.  The original edition is the better written of the two (no surprise there), but it didn't have much of a mystery and only the last few chapters were that interesting.  I found the whole Debbie Lynbrook thing in the revised edition rather neat and different, but for whatever reason the mystery never really grabbed my attention in this version.  Neither book is really that bad, but they are not ones that I'd highly recommend.	2003-07-06

Both books tell the story of a woman who owns many cats, of her long-lost love and of spooky tapping noises which she hears inside her house. However, each book tells the mystery in a different way so that they are basically two different stories. These were average books, not particularly exciting, but not boring either. The mystery isn't bad and there is a moderate amount of action. Personally, I thought that the revised edition was a little more interesting, but either one is worth reading. I'd give them both 3 stars.	2003-06-16

A search for stolen antique furniture sends Nancy, Bess and George to the Amish country of Pennsylvania.  This book was sooooo boring.  The mystery was not interesting and typically the \\"exciting\\" chapter endings had little or nothing to do with the mystery.  There was a secret connected with one of the pieces of furniture, but you learn so little about it until the end of the book that I just didn't care and when it was revealed it was dull anyway.  The end of the book is terrible as the crooks are caught without any help from Nancy.  Unless you want to read the entire set, I'd skip this one.	2003-06-16

The trunk which Nancy takes with her on a cruise to South America, along with a similar trunk owned by another passenger, appear to be at the center of a mystery. This book was alright, but I found that it really didn't have a mystery to it until the last few chapters. The first part of the book concentrates on the efforts of the mother of one passengers to keep Nancy from sailing. Ultimately, the mystery is somewhat dull and predictable and the book lacks much action. The book is probably worth reading, but I doubt that it will be one of many people's favorites.	2003-06-16

Nancy becomes involved in the search for the missing half of a treasure map and investigates the mysterious happenings at a cottage on an estate just outside of River Heights.  This is a pretty good book; more deserving of 3 1/2 stars.  The story is intriguing and well-written.  One thing that I like about this story is that there are numerous dishonest people also searching for the missing half of the map and you don't know if they are working together against Nancy or if they are working seperately.  This is an enjoyable adventure and is highly recommended.	2003-05-24

A widow seeks Nancy's help after she is robbed of a fortune in jewels.  It seems the woman's deceased husband's spirit instructed her to bury the jewels in the forest to prevent them from being stolen from her home.  Nancy is certain that the woman is the victim of a clever group of swindlers.  Her investigation puts her into contact with several young women who are being cheated out of their hard-earned paychecks and leads her to abandoned Blackwood Hall.  There, Nancy encounters an eerie, glowing ghost that inhabits the mansion.  This is definately one of the best Nancy Drew books.  The mystery is interesting and the story is fast-paced and well-written with lots of action.  I really enjoyed the middle chapters, particularly the first two times Nancy investigates Blackwood Hall and meets the ghost.  The whole book is great and a must-read for fans of the series.	2003-05-24

Nancy, Bess, George and Bess and George's cousin, Alice head west to spend the summer at a ranch in Arizona.  Unfortunately, this is pretty much all that the book is about.  The reader gets 203 pages of the girls' adventures during the numerous times that they are either lost in the wilderness or stuck there during storms. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  A feeble attempt to make the book interesting by adding a couple of mysteries, one concerning Alice and the other concerning an orphan girl being mistreated by her guardian, falls flat because the mysteries are just a sidenote to the escapades of Nancy and her friends.  I didn't read the revised edition published in the 1960s; however, the stories are similar.  The revised edition has an added mystery concerning a ghost horse which may make it more interesting, but typically the writing style used in the books published from the late 1950s on is so horrible that the books are just plain awful.  So I don't have much faith that the revised edition is any good either.  Only buy this dull book if you're looking to complete your set.	2003-05-24

In the original edition, Nancy becomes concerned over the welfare of twin babies recently adopted by the Blairs, an actor and actress, who only adopted the twins to further their social standing.  The babies are neglected by the Blairs as well as the nursemaid hired for them and Nancy becomes determined to find the twins mother, convinced that she did not willingly abandon the children.  How Nancy finds the babies' mother and reunites another set of twins seperated for many years is an interesting; although, not very exciting story.  This edition is very well-written, the characters are well-defined and the story is intruiging, but the book basically lacks a criminal (the Blairs aren't criminals, they're just not nice) and as such there was very little action and excitement.  If you read Nancy Drew to be excited, don't read this book, but if you enjoy an interesting story, by all means give this one a try.  In the revised edition, Nancy, George and Bess travel to Misty Lake and meet Cecily Curtis who provides the girls with two challenging mysteries.  First, her fiance is a successful music artist who suspects that his record company is cheating him out of some of the royalties from his songs; however, the company swears that they are being honest with him.  Second, Cecily is searching for a long-lost family treasure she believes is somewhere in the area; a broken half of a locket being her only clue.  Also factoring into this story are the apparition of a launch which sank in Misty Lake many years ago and a frightened girl who closely resembles Celily, but continually runs away from Nancy and her friends.  This is one of the few cases where I liked the revised edition of a book more than the original.  The book is surprisingly well-written considering it was published after the late 1950s when the quality of writing in the series went grossly downhill.  The mysteries are very intriguing and the book almost has a spooky quality about it.  The original edition I would rate 2 stars, but the revised edition I would rate 3 1/2 stars.	2003-05-15

Nancy reads a magazine article about an Englishman who is offering a reward for a centuries old stained-glass window believed to have been brought to the U.S. many years ago, but it has since vanished.  Believing that the window could be located around Charlottesville, Va, near Richmond, Nancy, Bess and George set off to stay with Nancy's cousin who lives in the area.  While there, an actress and her daughter beg Nancy to solve the mystery concerning the mysterious noises that they hear in their new home, Ivy Hall.  How Nancy locates the hidden window and discovers the truth behind the ghost of Ivy Hall is a rather interesting story.  Personally, I feel that this is the last of the really great books of the series.  From #35 on, the books are typically nothing more than horribly-written, boring mysteries that (if Nancy goes to an actual place) read more like tour guides than anything else.  The exceptions to this are few and far between.  Thankfully, this book is nothing like that.  The mystery is interesting, there is plenty of action and the book is fairly well-written.  The book also manages to keep you wondering just who is friend and who is foe.  I enjoyed reading this book and I would be surprised if other people who read this book couldn't say the same.	2003-05-15

Nancy, Bess and George travel to Candleton to help one of Mr. Drew's long-time clients, Mrs. Chantrey, who has been cheated out of some of her money.  While there, Nancy also learns of another mystery concerning a nearby cave along the coast.  The cave is reported to be inhabited by a ghost.  Whenever anyone comes too near to the cave, the ghost sounds a tolling bell as a warning to leave at once before water comes rushing out of the cave.  Several people have almost drowned and one person actually did die.  Intrigued by the mystery, Nancy becomes determined to learn the true secret of the cave.  This is definately one of the better Nancy Drew books.  The mystery is interesting, the writing is good and there is plenty of action and suspence.  I enjoyed this book very much and was never bored by it at all.  Something I particularly liked about this book was that Nancy actively participated in capturing most of the criminals.  This is a great book that I strongly recommend to any fan of Nancy Drew.	2003-05-08

This review concerns the original 1932 edition as well as the revised 1968 edition which tells a story similar to the original.  Nancy mistakenly receives a letter intended for another Nancy Drew, informing her that she has inherited a large sum of money.  Also, when Nancy invites her elderly mailman in for a drink of cocoa, his mailbag is stolen from Nancy's porch.  Nancy sets out to find the other Nancy Drew and to locate the person who took the mailbag so that she can restore the tarnished reputation of her mailman.  Personally, I found this book to be very boring.  The mystery is not exciting and there is very little action in the book.  Nancy solves the mystery in the end, but it is not through brilliant detective work, it is because she attends a football game at Emerson University.  I know that chance encounters always play a big part in solving the case in Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries, but this was just pure dumb luck and nothing else.  I wouldn't even waste your time on this one.	2003-05-08

Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites.	2003-04-29

Josiah Crowley has died and his will states that all of his money is to be left to the rich, snobby Topham family, who only took the old man into their home so that they could get his fortune.  However, there are rumors of a second will which would leave the money to people that actually liked and cared for Josiah and who are really in need of it. Desperatley wanting to help these people, Nancy is determined to locate the second will if it exists.  The original and revised editions have some differences (aside from the revised being shorter), but basically they tell the same story.  Personally, I prefer the original edition.  The writing is so much better in the original and the scenes are so well described that you can almost picture yourself there.  The revised editions are all stripped of the rich language that characterized the early original editions.  The story isn't bad and the mystery isn't very complex, which is understanable given that this is Nancy's first case.  This isn't the most exciting book, but it does manage to keep you entertained while you're reading it.	2003-04-12

Both editions involve the theft of valuable jewels which belong to Nancy's friend Emily from a place called Lilac Inn; however, that is pretty much where similarity between the two books ends.  In the original edition, Lilac Inn is a restaurant where Emily's guardian, Mrs. Willoughby, goes to have lunch while in possession of Emily's jewels.  After the jewels are stolen from Mrs. Willoughby, the police begin to suspect that she was involved in the theft.  Nancy and Emily believe in Mrs. Willoughby's innocence and Nancy sets out to find the real thief.  With the revised edition, Lilac Inn is an inn owned by Emily and her fiance.  The jewels are stolen during a dinner party where Mrs. Willoughby (who is Emily's aunt in this edition) was going to present Emily with the jewels.  Also Nancy has a look-a-like who is going around town causing all sorts of trouble.  Both editions are excellent books and because they are both distinct stories, you could read them both and not feel like you know exactly how the second one will turn out.  Both books had plenty of action and had good endings.  Personally, I prefered the original, but they are both interesting books.  Read them both if you can, you won't be disappointed with either one.	2003-04-12

Both books tell a similar story.  Nancy is given a horse charm bracelet as a gift; however, one of the charms is missing.  There is also a story connected with the bracelet that says that it was presented to a circus performer by a queen who loved horses.  The circus performer later had to reluctantly sell the bracelet, but refused to give her true identity and she is in desperate need of help.  Later, Nancy goes to the circus and meets a young girl, Lolita, who has a horse charm similar to the ones on Nancy's bracelet.  The girl's parents were trapeze artists, but died many years before and she is now being raised by the cruel ringmaster of the circus and his wife.  Many people in the circus believe that Lolita's mother may actually still be alive.  Nancy is determined to find the truth and hopefully free Lolita from her cruel guardians.  Most of this book is pretty good, the mystery is rather interesting and there is quite a bit of action.  However, the ending of the book is not good.  Everything happens much to quickly, there is little action and it takes all of one sentence for the criminals to be captured.  For the most part this is a good book, it just has a bad ending.	2003-04-12

In the original, Nancy wins a piece of land in northern Canada in a radio contest and almost immediately people are trying to buy the land from her. Could it be valuable? Determined to see the land for herself, Nancy, along with her friends Bess and George, set out for the remote wilderness of northern Canada. Along the way the three girls meet an authoress who tells them a sad story of how she was kept apart from her first love many years ago. Upon arriving at her land, Nancy finds that a ruthless group of swindlers is trying to steal her land from her. How Nancy reunites the authoress with her first love and outsmarts the group of swindlers makes for a rather interesting story. This really isn't a mystery story, it's more of an adventure; however, it is quite an exciting book. The story grabs your attention very quickly and there is plenty of action. The northern Canadian setting is used very effectively. The end of the book was very good, as it displays two of Nancy's best qualities, her courage and her willingness to sacrifice something that is hers to help someone else. Unfortunately, this edition is not the one found in new book stores; however, if you ever find it at a used book store, buy it, you won't be disappointed with it.  In the revised edition, Nancy goes to the Ohio River area of Illinois to search for a hollow oak.  Legend has it, that in the 1600s a French missionary hid a treasure in a hollow oak but was killed before he could reveal its location.  This version isn't bad.  The book kept me interested throughout but it never had me so engrossed that I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend reading this book, but I enjoyed the original version so much more.	2003-04-09

Nancy finds a carrier pigeon which contains a strange coded message.  Later, the family's doctor tells Nancy of how he was kidnapped and taken to a large home to treat an elderly lady, whom he believed was being held against her will.  Armed with a bracelet the doctor managed to slip off of the old lady's wrist as her only clue, Nancy sets off determined to find the house and free the old woman.  The revised edition has an added mystery concerning a spooky, blue circle of fire which has been appearing recently in the woods outside of the new home of Nancy's friend Helen's grandparents.  Personally, I liked the original edition much better than the revised edition.  The writing was better and the book flowed along a lot better than the revised edition did.  The extra mystery in the revised edition seemed out of place and really didn't make the book more interesting.  The main mystery of the book, Nancy trying to find the elderly woman, was good and is typical Nancy Drew, with Nancy risking her life attempting to help someone else.  Both editions were fairly suspenceful and had exciting endings; although again, I prefered the ending in the original story.  Either edition is worth reading, but I give the original 3 1/2 stars, while I give the revised 3 stars.	2003-04-08

The owner of the mansion tells Nancy about a phantom which apparently inhabits the library of the home and also he relates a strange story about a French wedding dress and valuable gifts which were lost during the sinking of the Lucy Belle in a nearby cove over 100 years before.  This book is easily the best of the Nancy Drew books from the mid thirties and higher.  So many of the books from #36 onward are little more than tour guides with a mystery built around them.  This book; however, is not like that.  The mystery is rather enjoyable and; generally, the book kept me interested until the end.  One thing that I particularly liked about this book was that Nancy and her friends actually were involved in capturing the crook, unlike in most of the books where; usually, Nancy does all of the work, but ultimately, it is the police who come in, save the day and capture the criminal.  My only complaint with the book was that it could have used a little more action.  I think that any fan of the series would enjoy reading this book.	2003-03-26

While on a shopping trip, Nancy, Bess and George meet a young girl named Millie (Joanne in the revised edition) who lives at Red Gate Farm with her grandmother.  Millie/Joanne and her grandmother may be forced to sell their farm because they don't have enough money, so they decide to take in boarders.  Nancy, George and Bess go to the farm to spend some time with their new friend and she tells them about a weird nature cult that rents part of their land and performs strange rituals at night.  Nancy; however, suspects that the cult is not quite what it seems.  To find out if she is right you'll have to read the book.  I really enjoyed this book.  I found the mystery intriguing and the writing was very good (at least with the original edition, which was the one I read).  I'd recommend reading the original edition, if possible, but either way, this is a very good story that fans of the series would enjoy.	2003-03-15

In the original edition, Mr. Drew has Nancy help him track down a missing heiress and Nancy, Bess and George stumble upon a mysterious moss-covered mansion.  They later hear that someone was murdered near the mansion and they repeatedly hear strange noises coming from inside the mansion.  I really enjoyed the first 100 or so pages of this book, but I found that after that I was gradually losing interest in the story.  Any of the chapter endings toward the end of the book that had even the smallest bit of interest were quickly resolved in the next chapter.  The end of the book was rather bad as the two best things about the book, the murder and the mansion, were resolved with dull explanations.  Most of this book is worth reading and I rate it 3 stars.  In the revised edition, Nancy, George, Bess, Mr. Drew and Hannah travel to Florida when a friend of Mr. Drew is accused of trying to sabotage the space program by sending a truck of explosive oranges to the Space Center complex at Cape Kennedy.  When you finally stop laughing over how lame this plot sounds and actually read the book, it; unfortunately, isn't any better.  There is not much action in the book, the mystery isn't very exciting and the writing style is vastly inferior to the original edition.  I didn't enjoy the revised edition of this  book at all and I'd give it a 1 1/2 star rating.	2003-03-15

Both books have a similar story; except  the revised edition is shorter, some characters names were changed and some events were either eliminated or altered.  During a storm, Nancy, Bess and George seek shelter at an old tea room.  While there, they meet a one hundred year old man named Asa Sidney, as well as an orphaned girl and her dishonest guardians.  This launches Nancy into the middle of an old family feud between Asa Sidney's relatives and the relatives of his deceased wife, who happens to have been the sister of Bess and George's great-grandfather.  Nancy's involvement in the feud ultimately costs her her friendship with Bess and George. Nancy has a lot of work to do as she tries to end the long-standing feud, repair her friendship with Bess and George, discover the parentage of the orphaned girl and prevent the girl's guardians from stealing the fortune that Asa Sidney has amassed.  There really isn't much of a mystery to this book; however, the story more than makes up for that.  Like all of the other books in the series, it features unscrupulous people up to something dishonest and Nancy's usual desire to help someone in need, but this time she is affected personally because of the loss of her friends.  I found the book to be very interesting and the writing was very descriptive (at least in the original version).  I recommend reading the original version over the revised edition, if possible, but either way this book should not be missed if you are a fan of Nancy Drew.  In my opinion it is one of the 5 best books of the series.	2003-03-01

This is an average book of this series.  The mystery is somewhat intriguing and Nancy and her friends come into contact with their enemies quite often, so there was a moderate amount of action in the book. One thing that I did find strange though was that all of the places that Nancy's group visited were randomly chosen, yet, in each case the same person was responsible for its being \\"haunted\\".  This is, in my opinion, one of the better books from #35-56.  I find that the books from that period generally read like tour guides, not mystery stories, and have way too much educational material which takes away from the mystery.  While this book has a lot of interesting educational material about shells, I didn't think that it took away from the mystery; although, it does seem out of place at points.  The thing that I liked least about the book was the ending.  In a word, it is awful.  Nancy's enemies walk into a room were Nancy and some police officers are hiding and unknowingly confess to everything before being captured.  How exciting is that?  It's not!  It's a unfortunately terrible ending for an otherwise not bad book.	2003-02-06

Is it because he is the only one that can identify the criminal, who is a master of disguise, that Mr. Hardy is after? And just how do the mysterious new tenants of the creepy Sayers mansion fit into the picture? The mystery comes to a climax as Frank, Joe and Chet are trapped in the mansion during a hurricane and must outsmart their enemies before they escape. I really enjoyed this book. It has quite a bit of action and starts off very well; the Hardy's have already had a couple of confrontations with the crooks by the end of chapter 2. The story is rather interesting and the book is fairly well-written (particularly from about page 90 until almost the end of the book, while the hurricane is going on). One thing that I especially liked was that many of the characters of the series were included in the book: Mr. and Mrs. Hardy, Aunt Gertrude, Jack Wayne, Chief Collig, the Mortons, even Ethel Radley was included. Unfortunately, though, none of the Hardy's friends, except Chet, were included. I was a little disappointed with the end of the book as I thought that the crooks were ultimately caught with not that much difficulty, but this doesn't really ruin an otherwise good story. I liked this book and I think that other fans of the series would enjoy it as well.	2003-02-01

Nancy becomes friends with an orphaned girl named Laura when she rescues Nancy and her friend Helen after their motorboat sinks during a violent storm.  Upon meeting Laura's new gaurdian, Nancy immediately dislikes him.  After Laura runs away from him, Nancy's suspicions of him are aroused even more.  Nancy goes to confront the man only to discover that Laura's gaurdian is not who he seems to be.  It's unfortunate that this book has the title that it does because I imagine that very few people were enticed to read the book based on its title.  Those that passed over this book missed a very interesting and original story for either this series or the Hardy Boys.  The book is very well-written (the original version, anyway) and from chapter 10 onwards is hard to put down.  Something that I particularly liked about this book was that Nancy actively had a hand in capturing the criminal (criminals in the revised edition). Don't passover reading this book because of its blah title.  I believe that most people who read this book will enjoy it.	2003-01-30

A couple of elderly ladies ask for Nancy's help in discovering the truth behind the mysterious things occuring at their house.  In my opinion, this is the best book of the series and the only one that I would rate 5 stars.  The book was rather well-written and the final few chapters were very interesting and really made me want to read more.  My only problem with this book is it's title.

Elderly Mr. March approachs Nancy seeking her help to find his deceased son's unpublished sheet music.  Mr. March desperately needs the money to care for his granddaughter, Susan.  Unfortunately, a thief has been secretly entering the March house and stealing whatever songs that he can find and publishing them himself.  I really enjoyed this book. In my opinion, it is the second or third best of the series (I can't decide between it and The Bungalow Mystery; The Hidden Staircase is my #1).  I found it to be well-written, highly descriptive, and had quite a bit of action.  The climax of the book, when Nancy finally finds the music and is confronted by the thief, is perhaps the best scene of the series for its originality, excitement and suspense.  The only thing that I did not like about this book, was how the thief was caught because Nancy had pretty much nothing to do with actually capturing him.	2003-01-30

The action was almost impossible to find and the story dragged on throughout most of the book.  The only good thing that I could say about this book was that the Hardys stayed in Bayport for a change and all of their friends were included in the book.  In my opinion, this is probably the 4th or 5th worst book of the hardcover editions.  Only buy this one if you want to complete your set.	2003-01-16

Mr. Hardy tracks down a terrorist group.  I think the author forgot to include something in this book, like a plot.  The book doesn't really seem to be about all that much.  What story there is, is incredibly boring and terribly unoriginal.  The book is lacking in both action and excitement.  Only about 2 or 3 of the chapter endings made me want to read more and I found that I wanted to get through the book only to be finished with it.  The title of the book is not very appropriate.  The terrorist group is called the Scorpio gang, but they could have been called the Barbie doll gang with little rewriting of the story.  The whole book is uninteresting, don't waste your time reading it.	2003-01-09

This book was not one of the better books of the series.  The mystery is average, but lacks any original thought.  The first 100 pages of the book are somewhat boring and rarely entice the reader to continue.  After that, the book gets better and is fairly interesting until the end.

Through the course of the book they travel to Zurich, Switzerland and the jungles of Mexico.  This book was absolutely awful.  The mystery is boring.  Frank and Joe are no closer to solving the case at page 150 than they were when the book began.  The reader is \\"treated\\" to a bunch of events that have absolutely nothing to do with the mystery (such as Frank and Joe skiing in Switzerland) and a bunch of boring cliffhangers.  When Frank and Joe finally do solve the mystery, it's not because of brilliant or hard detective work, it's because they follow someone.  If they had only done that back on page 25 the reader would be spared a lot of pointless events.  The book is poorly titled because the jungle pyramid has nothing to do with the case on which they are working. The book is terrible, don't waste your money on it.	2002-12-26

A group of treasure hunters take an immediate interest in the mask.  Frank and Joe believe that it is because of the mysterious Arabic words concealed in the mask which they believe may lead to a treasure.  This book wasn't bad; it is probably one of the better books of the 50s; although that doesn't neccesarily mean anything.  The book has a moderate amount of action and they run into the criminals quite often.  The mystery is fairly interesting and the book moves at a good pace.  During the course of the book, Frank, Joe and their friends are in Jamaica and Morocco; however, unlike many of the higher volumes, the book didn't come off as a geography lesson instead of a mystery story.  The book isn't one of the best of the series, but it won't bore the reader either.	2002-12-26

This book has a very intriguing mystery; it's exciting and it grabs your attention right away.  The book features witches, curses, a strange disappearance and an old castle.  Frank and Joe travel to London, Stonehenge, Ireland and the Isle of Man, but the book never sounds like a tour guide, as in many of the other high volumes when Frank and Joe travel.

Personally, I didn't care much for this book.  It certainly isn't one of the worst of the series, but it could have been much better.  I didn't find that the book was written particularly well and it could have used more action.  I found the book disappointing for a number of reasons.  For one, the most important clue to locating the helmet was given to the Hardys; instead of being something that they figure out for themselves.  As well, while Frank, Joe and Evan are harassed by a couple of the crooks throughout much of the book, they hardly ever actually come into contact with them until the end of the book.   The only one of the Hardy's friend to appear in the book is Chet and he is only in the beginning and the end.

Along the way they come across an Austrian mountain climber, a crazy man who believes he is related to King Arthur and a number of gangs that try to scare them off of the case.  Most of this book is quite good; the story was fairly well written and it was fairly action-packed.  I liked that there were three gangs after the Hardys and their friends.  I found that it made it interesting trying to figure out who belonged to which gang and how they were all connected.  The title is somewhat misleading, though, because the book has nothing to do with vampires and vampire bats play only a small role in the story.  While most of the book deserves a four star rating, I gave the book three stars because the last chapter was really bad.  It lacked excitement, was more silly than anything and was a big letdown to an otherwise good book.	2002-10-30

He asks them to call a shipping company in New York; however, a mistake with the area code causes them to reach the Pentagon, instead, just at the precise moment that a robbery occurs.  These events lead Frank and Joe to Baltimore, where they attempt to track down the gang.  The premise for this book is rather ridiculous considering that the area code for New York is 212 and that for Washington D.C. is 202.  The 0 and the 1 are nowhere near each other on either a touch tone phone nor a rotary dial phone, so I don't see how a mistake like that could happen if you know the number you are calling.  If your willing to accept this and just read the book, it's not that bad.  The mystery is fairly well paced and there is quite a bit of action.  The ending is somewhat silly, but mostly the book isn't that disappointing.	2002-10-16

While there, they become involved in the search for a missing U.S. astronaut.  This is an excellent book for anyone planning a trip to Iceland because the author has included many bits of information about the island.  Unfortunately, he forgot that this is a Hardy Boys MYSTERY story, because there is very little mystery to this book.  The plot is incredibly boring.  What little action or cliffhangers are in the book are usually something that has no connection to the mystery, such as a plane crash or somebody disappearing, and they are resolved by the first or second pages of the next chapter.  The book is anti-climatic because the most important criminals are captured during chapter 18 and the remaining criminals are so unimportant that they aren't even given names.  This is an awful book; so, unless you're a glutton for punishment, DON'T READ IT!!!	2002-08-18

This mystery is filled with action and it has a rather interesting and well-thought-out plot.  The Hardys are constantly coming into contact with the criminals during the course of the book and you are not always sure who is good and who is a member of the gang.  One thing that I particularly like about this book is that, unlike many of the higher volumes, it remembers that Frank and Joe have friends and they are well-used in the book.  It's not the greatest book, but I consider it to be one of the better of the higher volumes.	2002-08-17

Later, Frank and Joe learn that Mr. Hardy was kidnapped by agents of UGLI, an international spy ring, and they team up with agents from SKOOL, a counterespionage ring, to find their father and bring down UGLI. This book is rather interesting; it has a good plot, plenty of action and Frank and Joe are constantly coming into contact with the criminals. I do have a few problems with this book, however. First, I find it very hard to believe that agents from top-secret counterespionage group would work with a couple of high school kids to bring down a group like UGLI; I don't care who their father is or how good Frank and Joe's own success record is, it just wouldn't happen. Second, those names are just too corny; no group, good or bad, is going to call themselves UGLI. Finally, during the book, Frank and Joe find a code message from their father and later figure out that it is the latitude and longitude coordinates of where Mr. Hardy was being taken by his captors. Since I doubt that the criminals would have readily supplied Mr. Hardy with this information, this part of the book is a little hard to believe. If you're willing to accept these things you'll probably enjoy the book very much; if you're not, don't even bother to pick it up.	2002-07-30

Unsure of who they can trust on the crew, the Hardy's and their friends face numerous dangerous situations before they bring the criminals to justice.  This was probably the last of the hardcover volumes that I really enjoyed and none of the higher volumes come that close to being as good as this one.  The book was surprisingly well-written and was interesting right from page 1; although, the final 100 pages, once the Hardy's get to Kentucky, are particularly good.  I really liked the fact that the Hardy's friends were included in the book and were used very well.  I think that most Hardy Boys fans would enjoy this book.	2002-07-06

The paintings, of nearby Fort Senandaga, were painted by an ancestor of Davenport's and one of the paintings in the series is supposed to contain a clue to the hiding place of a valuable chain of gold.  The book was average, it had an okay plot and a moderate amount of action.  I expected better from the interesting sounding title, but it wasn't bad.  I recommend reading it, but I don't think that too many fans will get very excited over it.	2002-05-14

However, when they arrive, he is nowhere to be found and they are told an almost unbelievable story of a two hundred year-old witch that emerges from the hollow at night to steal dogs and terrorize the people of the village with her screaming.  Frank, Joe and Chet try to solve the mystery of the witch, the disappearance of their friend and what connection, if any, a deaf, mute boy has to the strange happenings in the hollow.  This book is excellent, it is one of the best books of the entire series and is easily the best book of the hardcovers from 39-58.  The action starts in the first chapter and it never lets up.  This book is probably the best written and most descriptive of the later volumes.  This is a great book and should not be missed by any Hardy Boys fan.	2002-03-26

Did he leave by his own choice or was he kidnapped?  Also, Mr. Hardy investigates a group of criminals who are counterfeiting government checks.  I thought that this book had a very good plot, it was fairly well-written, the events moved along quite well and there was quite a bit of interaction between the Hardys and the criminals during the course of the book.  However, I found that the book could have used a bit more action and that, while I did enjoy the book, it never completely grabbed my interest to the point where I didn't want to put it down.  I would recommend reading this book, but while most fans would probably like it, few probably would say that they absolutely loved it.	2002-03-09

However, shortly after they buy the junk, two rival chinese groups begin pressuring the boys to sell the boat.  Also, Frank and Joe discover that a dangerous criminal who calls himself \\"The Chameleon\\" may be in Bayport.  Frank, Joe and their friends must find out why the two groups of chinese are interested in their boat and discover the true identity of the Chameleon.  The book has a moderate amount of action, but the mystery isn't that interesting.  In the end, it isn't even Frank or Joe who discovered the secret of the junk or were responsible for capturing the criminals, it was their friends.  While it was nice to see their friends do this for a change, this is the \\"Hardy Boys\\" series for a reason.  One thing that I really did like about this book; though, was that it did remember that Frank and Joe have friends other than Chet and they were used quite often, unlike in many of the later books.  The book is worth reading, but it is not one of the best of the series.	2002-03-02

The Hardys receive a telegram from their friend, Tony, who took a summer job in Alaska, as a stream guard for the Fish And Wildlife Service, and now believes that he has stumbled upon a mystery.  Frank and Joe, along with Chet, head to the Alaskan wilderness to investigate why a gang is determined to get Tony away from his post and to search for an employee of the Fish And Wildlife Service who has disappeared.  While this is not one of the best books of the series, it wasn't one of the worst.  It's not as well written as most of the early volumes, but it is better written than many of the later volumes and has a good amount of action.  While I, personally, do not like the constant globetrotting that the Hardys seem to do in many of the later volumes, the setting of Alaska was used very effectively by the author.  This book might be only slightly better than average, but it still should not be skipped.	2002-02-07

This review concerns the original 1955 edition and the revised 1972 edition which is a shorter version of the original. Frank and Joe's friend Tony inherits a collection of curios and immediately a gang of thieves is interested in a couple of medallions that were apart of the inheritance. The mystery of the medallions takes Frank, Joe, Chet and Tony on a treasure hunt to Guatemala. Personally, I didn't find this book very good. I thought that it lacked much action and many of the chapter endings didn't entice me to read more right away. The plot of the book was rather weak and not very creative and it took the Hardys and their friends no time at all to find the treasure after arriving in Guatemala; although, that didn't happen until page 160. While some fans may like this book, it definately wasn't one of my favorites.	2002-02-02

A friend of Mr. Hardy gives Frank and Joe a falcon so that they can help their father with his case concerning the smuggling of Indians into the U.S., also Frank and Joe search for a kidnapped Indian prince. This book was alright, the first half of it has some slow moments; however, the last 7 chapters were rather good. The book has a moderate amount of action and while the plot isn't totally original, it isn't bad and alot of kids would probably find the parts concerning the falcon interesting. One thing that I did like about the book was that many of the other characters of the series (Mr. Hardy, Chet, Tony, Sam Radley) were used often. It's not one of the best books, but it is worth reading.	2002-02-02

The original and revised editions are essentially identical, the plot and the events are the same and the only differences are in the phrasing of a few sentences.  Frank and Joe become involved in Mr. Hardy's top secret case when he sends them a note to look for \\"Hugo Purple Turban\\" which turns out to be a ventriloquist's dummy that has diamonds hidden in it's eyes.  Eventually, Mr. Hardy asks Frank, Joe, Chet and Tony to go to Puerto Rico to assist him, but when they arrive, Mr. Hardy is missing.  Personally, I think that the author tried too hard to make this book action packed and exciting, but alot of it is too coincidental and doesn't make sense.  First of all, when Frank and Joe are first trying to find \\"Hugo Purple Turban\\", they go to see a fortuneteller named Hugo that Aunt Gertrude told them about and this man just happens to be a part of the gang they are after.  Second, of all the shops in the U.S. that would carry ventriloquist's dummies \\"Hugo Purple Turban\\" just happens to get sent to a shop in Bayport.  My biggest problem with this book is its title.  The ghost and even Skeleton Rock play a very small part in this book and could easily have been eliminated without altering the story.  The ghost isn't even mentioned until chapter 18.  Some fans may love this book, but I didn't and any fan who reads this book expecting a story about a ghost is going to be sadly disappointed.	2002-02-02

Frank and Joe are asked to locate a cannon lost during a battle in the vicinity of Bayport in the 1700s. While this book is not one of the worst of the series, it is definately not one of the best either. The mystery is mediocre and the book lacks much suspence. One thing that I did like about the book was that there were three different people interested in finding the cannon, and you are not sure whether any of them are friends or foes. This is an alright book worth reading, but you probably won't find it to be one of the best.	2002-01-27

Greg Woodson, the grandson of the recently deceased owner of Woodson Academy, Mr. Hardy's old school, asks Frank and Joe to locate his grandfather's missing will which would prove that Greg is the rightful heir to the academy. However, a crook, who uses a yellow feather as his symbol is trying to stop them. Frank and Joe must find out who or what the Yellow Feather really is. This mystery reminded me of a Nancy Drew mystery, although, for those that aren't a fan of that series, don't let that discourage you from reading this book because it was actually rather good, despite having only one criminal. The book was well written and had a fair bit of action. I think most Hardy Boys fans would enjoy this one.	2002-01-27

Frank, Joe and Chet travel to the southern U.S. to help a retired general find a fortune lost during the civil war.  This was a really good book; it was well written and had a lot of action.  Two things that I liked about this book were that unlike some books where Frank and Joe have little contact with the criminals until the last chapters, in this book they were constantly running into the crooks, also, there was actually a mystery to solve in this book (the location of the treasure), instead of some other volumes where Frank and Joe are merely trying to capture a certain gang.

Frank and Joe are plunged into another mystery when they are out in the Sleuth during a storm and they find a wallet full of money and when they track down some rifles and camping equipment stolen from Chet to the North Woods.  This book has one of the best opening chapters of any in the series and it gets you into the mystery very quickly.  The pages from about 60-130 when the Hardys and their friends go camping in the North Woods are the best, but the whole book is really good.  One thing I liked about this book was that it actually remembered that Frank and Joe have other friends besides Chet and they were given more than just a passing mention.  It's a great book any Hardy Boys fan would want to read.	2002-01-03

When a phony leather goods salesman steals the key to Mr. Hardy's filing cabinet, Frank, Joe and Chet track a clue to an indian village and end up helping the indians find the lost deed to their land to prove their ownership. This book isn't bad, but it's not one of the really good ones either. The first half of the book is a little dull, but the last half is pretty good and it isn't until this point that the indian mystery comes into the story. If you don't mind the first part of the book you should enjoy the last part.	2002-01-03

This review concerns the original 1952 edition and the revised 1969 edition, which is an editted, shorter version of the original. Frank and Joe must find out why the group of train robbers their father is after are determined to keep Frank, Joe and their science teacher from going to Wildcat Swamp to search for fossils. This book is excellent; it is one of the top three books of the series. The book is well-written and is loaded with action from the first chapter to the last. There is an interesting collection of memorable criminals and the Hardys frequently come into contact with them. Both editions are excellent, but I recommend reading the original, only because it prolongs your enjoyment.  This is a great book that all Hardy Boys fans should read.	2002-01-03

The revised edition follows the plot of the original and only had some events cut to eliminate some pages.  Bayport is facing a water shortage when the newly constructed reservoir on Skull Mountain will not fill with water. The funny thing is that the water level in the reservoir rises during the day, but then it falls again at night. Frank, Joe and Chet camp out on Skull Mountain with two engineers to try to solve the mystery. Both editions are really great books; the original is well-written (the revised edition lost much of the rich language of the original, for that reason I'd rate it 4 stars), both have lots of interesting characters, a lot of action and an intriguing mystery. This book is what the series needed to get back on track following the extremely disappointing \\"The Phantom Freighter\\".  Both books are really good; although, if possible, I'd recommend reading the original.  I can't think that any Hardy Boys fan would find either of these books boring.	2001-12-13

The revised edition has the same plot as the original and is only shorter.  An old grouch needs to take a vacation, but since he isn't pleased with anything, he hires Frank and Joe to plan the trip. Also, a smuggling ring operates using a freighter. For those of you that did not fall asleep after reading that summary, that truely is what the book is about. This is absolutely the worst book in the series (at least from 82 down), the only book that even comes close to being this bad is #76 Game Plan For Disaster. This book has a weak plot, no action, no mystery, no suspense. The phantom freighter plays only a small part in the story. It's unfortunate that Amazon.com doesn't allow us to give a zero star rating because that is what this book deserves. This was the last Hardy Boys book that Leslie MacFarlane wrote and it is obvious that he just didn't care anymore. The only Hardy Boys fans I'd recommend this book to are those suffering from insomnia.	2001-12-11

The Hardys investigate a group of criminals who are boldly robbing pedestrians in Bayport and other towns. Also, Frank, Joe and Chet go to New Mexico to help Mr. Hardy's cousin Ruth when cowboys start mysteriously disappearing from her ranch. Are the two mysterys connected, well of course they are, but you have to read the book to find out how. The book was pretty good; it was well-written and the setting of New Mexico was used effectively without the book sounding like it was a tour guide. There were a number of interesting characters and a good amount of action. There probably would not be too many Hardy Boys fans that would be disappointed after reading this book.	2001-12-11

Frank and Joe help their father capture a group of thieves that steal valuable radio equipment and communicate in code using short-wave radio.  Also, an old friend of Mr. Hardys asks for the detective's help in locating some missing friends.  This was the first book in which Chet had a hobby (in this case, taxidermy) that played a part in the mystery.  Not much to say about this book, actually, it's neither good nor bad, just average.  The mystery is not spectacular and it's not boring either.  Most Hardy Boys fans would probably not be very excited by this book, but it probably won't put them to sleep either.	2001-12-02

A stranger nearly crashes into Frank and Joe's car due to poor repair work.  He introduces himself as John Mead and later asks Frank and Joe to go to his house to turn off a light he left on; however, Frank and Joe learn that the man they talked to has been dead for five years and the doors of his mansion have no visible doorknobs or keyholes. Also, a woman seeks Mr. Hardy's help in locating her son, Lenny, who got mixed up with a group of criminals, was shot during a robbery and is now being hidden behind a secret panel. The original and revised editions are nearly identical.  One of the few differences that I noticed was that, in the revised edition, John Mead drops his key and Joe finds it after Mead has left. This was an action packed mystery with many different angles that all tied together in the end (don't they always). Although, it didn't take much thought to figure out where Lenny was hidden, the book is well written and interesting. It may not be the best Hardy Boys book, but I'd be surprised if any Hardy Boys fan thought this one was bad.	2001-12-02

The mystery was interesting and there was a moderate amount of action.

An elderly scientist comes to the Hardy home to seek Mr. Hardy's help in finding out who is stealing valuable silkworms from his lab.  Mr. Hardy is busy on a case of government supplies being stolen from road construction sites, so Frank and Joe tackle the case for the scientist.  Of course, the Experimental Farm where Frank and Joe had summer jobs is near the scientists home, and, oddly enough, a road construction site is also nearby.  The book was a little slow going to start and I imagine many readers, after reading the first couple of chapters, would feel like giving up on the book, but it ended well.  There is a moderate amount of action and the writing is good.  One thing I didn't like about this book was that, aside from Aunt Gertrude and Mr. Hardy, none of the other main characters of the series played a prominent role in this book.  This isn't the most thrilling book, but most readers would probably not feel like they wasted their time reading it.	2001-11-11

This book is well written, fast paced, has plenty of action and has a good beginning that quickly grabs the reader.  My big problem with the book was that, while Mr. Hardy played a prominent role in this book, he was the only one of the other main characters of the series to do so, since most of the book was set outside of Bayport.  Still, it was a really good book that most Hardy Boys fans should enjoy.	2001-11-11

Frank and Joe help their father track down a gang of vicious bank robbers and stumble upon a crazy man's mysterious, old mansion filled with his strange inventions.  This is easily the most imaginative of all of the Hardy Boys books, with all of the interesting gadgets that the author included in the book; however, it is not a very well written book.  There are a number of cases of people meeting in the most unlikely of areas, plot points that are totally irrelevant to the book and never explained (Frank and Joe find an envelope with a $100 bill in it at the beginning of the book, it is never mentioned again until the end of the book and it is never explained to whom the money belongs) and, at one point, Frank, Joe and Chet are at the mansion, Chet becomes frightened, runs off and is not mentioned again until Frank and Joe return to Bayport.  The whole side of the book that concerns the mansion is not that important to the story, even though it is the most interesting part.  It seems as though the author had a great idea for this weird house and then had to write in the bank robbers to provide bad guys for the story, because the first 80, or so, pages, until Frank and Joe first arrive at the mansion, drag on a bit.  From that point on the book is pretty good.  If nothing else, though, the book is interesting enough because of the strange gadgets and most Hardy Boy's fans would not think the book a waste of their time.	2001-10-23

I'd more accurately give the book 3 1/2 stars instead of a 4 star rating.  The plot of the book was pretty good and there was a fair bit of action.  I only found three things really wrong with the book : 1.other regular characters, like Chet, Mr. Hardy, etc., weren't included in most of the book, 2.the end of the book was a bit disappointing, as the spies were rounded-up with little incident, and 3.the author doesn't appear to have been that familiar with the characters in the series because he called Mrs. Hardy Mildred, instead of Laura and he replaced Chief Collig with a Chief Finch.  Otherwise, the book was quite enjoyable and I think that most Hardy Boys fans would like reading it.	2001-10-23

There is no mystery, the plot is boring and the action is almost non-existent.

Frank, Joe and Chet join a deep-sea diving operaton that is trying to recover a fortune in gold and jewels from a sunken oceanliner.  While this book is not as awful as the really bad volumes of the series, it isn't good and is probably more deserving of 1.5 stars than the  2 star rating that I gave it.  There is no mystery in this book; it is more of an adventure story.  Frank and Joe meet a deep-sea diver who mistakenly leaves their home with some of Mr. Hardy's papers, so Frank and Joe must track him down to retrieve the papers.  Upon completion of this they are asked to remain with the diving operation which is raising a ship.  Once this is over, they remain with the crew which then moves on to the recovery of the treasure from the oceanliner.  Because the book moves from one phase to another I found it very choppy and the first 150, or so, pages were rather boring and unimportant.  The criminals in the book seem more like two-bit hoodlums than anything else and their motive for hating the Hardys is rather weak.  As far as the writing is concerned, the book is lacking in the rich language and well-described scenes that characterize the low volumes of the original editions.  For fans who are also interested in deep-sea diving, you may want to read this book because there is plenty of that, but otherwise don't bother with this one because you'll only find yourself hoping that the end comes soon so that you can get finished this book.	2001-10-09

Also a friend asks them to help his grandfather whose jazz club has been targeted by a voodoo cult.  This book wasn't bad, the mystery was average and the action level was average, too.  The title I feel is a little misleading though, as voodoo doesn't have all that much to do with the book.  Most Hardy Boys fans would probably feel that reading this book wasn't a waste of time.	2001-09-30

Also, Mr. Hardy asks the boys help in stopping a gang of rebels on a small Mediterranean island nation.  This book was action packed and fans of the volumes currently produced would probably love this book; however, fans who liked the volumes of the original series, when Frank and Joe primarily stayed in and around Bayport, will find this book too modern for their liking and probably won't enjoy it as much.	2001-09-30

Frank, Joe and Chet become involved in an old-time Southern feud when they come to the aid of an elderly man and he later accuses them of robbing him.  This book actually reminds me more of something that I would read in the Nancy Drew series, but for people who aren't fans of Nancy Drew, don't let that keep you from reading this book, because I really enjoyed it.  The book is very well-written and is very interesting. I'd recommend this one to any Hardy Boys fan.	2001-09-30

Frank and Joe aid their father in rounding up an unscrupulous, phony surgeon, who dupes his victims by promising miracle cures for their eyesight problems.  The book is well-written and the action level isn't bad, but there is no real mystery to solve.  Frank and Joe aren't trying to find out who did what, or where something is hidden or what this gang is up to; they are just trying to get evidence that this surgeon is a crook.  For this reason, I found that the book never really made me curious to find out what was coming next.  The book is really good from pages 192-204, but unfortunately that isn't enough to make this a great book.  I'd only recoomend this one to true Hardy Boys fans.	2001-09-30

Suspicious events at a home in Bayport and the disappearance of a valuable race horse combine to make one of the most interesting and exciting Hardy Boys books.  This book was great; well-written, well-paced, and the mystery was highly intriguing.  This book has one of the best endings of all of the Hardy Boys books that I have read and is especially good from page 172 on.  It's an excellent book that I would recommend to all Hardy Boys fans.	2001-09-30

The search for a missing witness leads Frank, Joe and Mr. Hardy to Mexico.  I'd more accurately give the book 3.5 stars.  The book; although not quite as well written as earlier volumes, was loaded with action and adventure.  Chapters 15-23 were very good; however the final two chapters were a major letdown, as the mystery was resolved much too soon.  One thing that I did not like about the book was that after the first few of chapters, none of the Hardy's friends were included in the mystery.  But still, it was a good book; definately worth reading.	2001-09-21

A mysterious stranger apparently steals some of Mr. Hardy's papers from the Hardy home, suspicious events are occuring at the local Chinese laundry and one of Mr. Hardy's clients demands that his name be cleared of rumors that he is involved in smuggling Chinese immigrants.  All these things combine to make...absolutely nothing.  The first fifty pages of the book are alright, but after that the book goes nowhere.  The writing, unlike the other low volumes of the original set, is awful.  Some examples, there is a criminal in the book that owns a large dog.  During the course of the book the Hardy boys capture this man and take him, by boat, to a cabin up the Willow River.  Minutes after arriving at the cabin, there is a sound at the door.  When the door is opened, in barges the criminal's dog.  How this dog managed to find his master in this cabin is totally beyond me and it is never explained in the book.  Another example of poor writing : early in the book, a character is stabbed; however, he appears to be fully healed within a matter of days.  The Hardy's friends are sorely missing from most of the mystery and action and excitement are virtually absent from this book (it doesn't get exciting until page 206).  This book isn't worth reading so don't waste your time on it.	2001-09-18

The revised edition closely follows the plot of the original and the two books are only different in that the revised edition is shorter than the original and some events have been added, eliminated or altered from one book to the other.  A man from a neighboring town is receiving death threats, left in the secret room of a mansion that he recently purchased, and upon learning that Fenton Hardy is out of town, reluctantly allows Frank and Joe to investigate. As with all of the low volumes of the original set, this book gets high marks for the writing, in terms of the language used and the level of description applied to the scenes. The mystery is highly intriguing; however, the book is a little light (just a little) on action and this keeps it from ranking as truly one of the best Hardy Boys books.	2001-09-18

At the stroke of midnight, Joe is kidnapped from a party at the Morton farm and Frank and his chums set out, not only to find Joe, but to discover why he was kidnapped.  I'd more accurately give the book a rating of 3.5 stars.  The writing, like with all previous volumes, is excellent and the mystery is alright, but the book doesn't quite live up to the intriguing title.  Mr. Hardy does not make an appearance in the book as he is said to be on a case out West and, in my opinion, his omission only hurts the story.  Most readers would probably not rate this book as one of their favorites in the set, but they probably wouldn't rate it as one of their least favorites either.	2001-09-04

Frank and Joe are arrested following the theft of valuable mail bags from the airport and must track down the real thieves in order to clear their names.  While there is nothing spectacular about this book to make it stand out from the rest, it is by no means a bad book.  The mystery is interesting and there is a decent amount of action.  One thing that I did like about this book was that the criminals were featured prominently thoughout the book, unlike in some other volumes where Frank and Joe don't come across the criminals until the last few pages.  Many readers will find it odd that the Hardys and their friends graduate from high school in this book (especially since in #10, they are back in high school), apparently, with the beginning of the Great Depression, the author must have been unsure as to whether or not the series would continue.  This is an above average book any Hardy Boys fan would enjoy reading.	2001-09-02

While spending the Christmas holiday on Cabin Island with their chums, Chet and Biff, Frank and Joe Hardy stumble upon a mystery surrounding the disappearance of a valuable stamp collection.  The mystery related in this book, though interesting, is average.  It is the writing that makes this book a joy to read.  The scenes are so well described that one could almost picture oneself there at that time and the language used hasn't been dumbed down like in many of the recent volumes.  The action is well-paced and it didn't feel as though the mystery was solved too quickly.  This was a great book, definately worth reading.	2001-09-02

An elderly lady seeks Fenton Hardy's assistence in locating her twin brother who disappeared shortly after an accident. Meanwhile, Frank, Joe, Chet and Biff travel up the coast to camp at some caves where mysterious things are occuring. This book is easily the worst of books 1-10. The writing (language used, descriptive scenes, etc.) is excellent, like in all of the early originals; however the writing is the only saving grace of this book and the only real reason to read it. The plot is weak and their is no real mystery. There is only one criminal in the book. He is captured on page 139 and the manner in which he is captured was the second most pathetic way that I have seen in all of the Hardy Boys books that I have read; the worst being the criminal in #76 &quot;Game plan For Disaster&quot; that the Hardy's find already tied up on a motel room floor. Unfortunately for Frank and joe they had to tie the guy up this time, but; otherwise, it was somewhat similar. The book contains too many ridiculous coincidences. The Hardys are supposed to be miles from Bayport, yet when they look for a passing motorist to take the criminal to the police station in Bayport, not only is the very first car they stop going to Bayport, the driver is someone the Hardy's know. If that wasn't enough, a similar situation happens later in the book. The reader is left to figure out the explanation of the strange happenings at the caves because it is never explained. This book is worth reading for the writing, but that's about it.	2001-08-28

When Fenton Hardy is injured during a case, he asks Frank and Joe to join him in Montana to find some stolen gold.  I'd more accurately give the book 4.5 stars.  The mystery was great, with plenty of action and the book was well-written; however, the book is half over before Frank and Joe finally reach Montana and I found that this was too long.  Also, while it was good to see Frank And Joe singlehandedly catch the criminals for a change, unlike the first four books, it seemed a little too simple.  But, still, it was an enjoyable book; well worth reading.	2001-08-22

A string of auto thefts along the Shore Road has baffled the Bayport police force.  When a school friend of the Hardy's and his father are accused, Frank and Joe decide to track down the thieves.  A well-written book, like all of the low-numbered original editions; this book has an interesting plot, plenty of excitement and a little bit of humor.  As well, unlike in the three previous volumes of the series, the criminals did not simply give up upon being cornered which kept the ending from being anticlimatic.  All in all, a great book.	2001-08-22

The book is slow to start and it isn't until chapter 11 that it really starts to get interesting; however, from that point on, this book probably has one of the best endings of any in the series with lots of suspence and excitement.  Unfortunately, as with the previous volume, at the end of the book, the criminals are caught without much of an incident which detracts from an otherwise terrific ending	2001-08-22

Counterfeit money is being circulated in Bayport and Frank and Joe attempt to track down the criminals. A great book and, like all of the low editions of the original set, very well written. These books are interesting enough just for the little glimpse of life back in the 1920s that they provide. This book has a good, realistic mystery and plenty of action. The only problem with this book was the ending, which was surprisingly boring. Despite this, I'd still recommend this book.	2001-08-10

Frank and Joe Hardy are determined to prove to their father that they are ready to become detectives just like he is, so when Tower Mansion is robbed, Frank and Joe try to track down not only the thief, but also the loot.  This mystery is not nearly as complex or as dangerous as the mysteries in other volumes, but that is understandable given that this was to be Frank and Joe's first case to solve.  I found that any loss of excitement from not having a dangerous mystery was made up for with the writing.  The richly described scenes and humor, which are sorely lacking in most of the later volumes, along with the glimpses of life at that time, make this a book well worth reading.	2001-08-01

A sheep farmer seeks Nancy's help in deciphering some pictures painted on a parchment after receiving an anonymous phone call that it would right a great wrong.  This is without a doubt the worst book that I have ever read.  No mystery, no action, no suspence.  The phone book is classic literature compared to this book.  The book is just boring, boring, boring.  For God sake, the bad guy is arrested while sitting on his living room couch and he never actually does anything to hinder Nancy's investigation other than be unpleasant to her.  I bet that ending must have taken days of thought and careful planning to achieve.  The only person I'd recommend this book to is a child that is constantly complaining that she/he is bored.

Fans of the lower volumes would probably not enjoy this book very much.  The writing style is very different; it seemed as though every dangerous situation Frank and Joe got into was life threatening, instead of just possibly resulting in injury and they seemed designed more for shock value.  The author of this particular book must have completely forgotten about Aunt Gertrude because she was missing from a part in which she should have been included. The plot was so-so, while the clues that Frank and Joe followed were well thought out, the idea for the mystery itself was rather weak.  Fans of the current volumes might enjoy this book, but I wouldn't recommend it for fans of the early volumes of the series.	2001-07-06

For fans of the series, like myself, that are mostly familiar with the lower volumes, this book is different; the book is shorter than the low volumes and the writing style has changed.  The plot reminded me of something I would have seen on an old episode of Scooby-Doo, just written better and more seriously.  The book has plenty of action and it's centered around the mystery (instead of something like &quot;At the top of the staircase Frank tripped and went flying down the stairs&quot;).  I'd recommend this book to fans of the higher volumes and for fans of the lower volumes who are looking to try some of the higher volumes; this would be a good one with which to start.	2001-07-06

For fans of the series who don't like when the Hardys travel everywhere to solve the mystery; this book takes place solely in Bayport.  Many of the characters from the lower volumes appear in this book, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hardy, Aunt Gertrude, Chet, Biff, Tony, Phil, Sam Radley, Jack Wayne, Callie and Iola, and they play more prominent roles, too, instead of being mentioned once and thats it, like in many of the higher volumes.

The book has a good mystery, but, unforfunately, VERY little of the details about it are revealed until late in the book, which made the book rather boring and hard to enjoy.  There was little action in the story; chapter endings were often something that could happen(Frank and Joe wondering what was happening to Chet or hoping that Chet and a friend were there to help them in case of trouble) or the endings were just plain boring and nothing that made you want to read the next chapter right away.	2001-06-14

Perhaps I expect too much from those books with titles like &quot;Track Of The Zombie&quot;, &quot;Night Of The Werewolf&quot; or &quot;The Witchmaster's Key&quot;, but rarely have the books ever lived up to such appealing titles (that is not to say that the books were bad, though).  This book was mistitled because the zombie parts could have easily been eliminated without changing the plot much.  The story isn't bad, it is fairly fast-paced, and has a fair amount of action, but for anyone anticipating a story about a zombie, you'll be disappointed with this one.	2001-06-14

Frank and Joe are hired to go to Chile to find a stolen Easter Island stone idol and also go to Antarctica to help their father catch a gang of thieves.  This book is bad.  It lacks mystery, action or suspence.  The plot is thin and the whole Antarctica part only serves to fill pages.  A boring read from beginning to end.	2001-06-12

The book starts well and ends well, but it gets a little off track in the middle.  It could have been better, but was still worth reading.	2001-06-12

A magician's convention is being held in Bayport and Frank and Joe are asked to help ensure that everything runs smoothly.  Also, the old opera house, which is under renovation, is plagued by a series of accidents which are apparently caused by a ghost.   I thought that the book was better written than most of the paperbacks that I have read (the lower ones) and the plot more interesting and not as predictable as others I have read.  It's not the best book ever, but certainly worth reading.	2001-06-09

(The Hardy Boys)	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A Book Definately Worth Reading	While in a former mining town near Lake Tahoe to investgate the disappearance of a movie actor, Frank and Joe become involved in a decades old feud between the town's youth.  Before I read the book, I didn't expect it to be very good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it well written and with an intriguing plot.	2001-06-09

While I enjoyed the book, I expected it to be better than it was.  I felt that the voodoo side of the book was not utilized like it could have been and I found the book rather anticlimactic.	2001-06-09
