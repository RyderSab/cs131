Obi-Wan and his Master, Qui-Gon, tackle a mysterious mission that revolves around the followers of the Sith -- and a search for the Holocron, a mystical object that enables its user to have great powers. The Holocron has been hidden under a planet's dangerous ocean for many years, and all who have gone after it failed. When Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are sent to retrieve it so that it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, the mission is still left unsolved. Ten years later, when Qui-Gon has been killed and Obi-Wan has Anakin for his apprentice, once again the threat of the Dark Side arises. The followers of the Sith are apparently still waiting for the chance when they will have their hands on the Holocron. Obi-Wan and Anakin have to stop the Dark Side from winning. The future of all darkness in the galaxy rests in their mission now. Jedi Apprentice: Special Edition #2: The Followers is Jude Watson's final chapter in the Jedi Apprentice series, but thankfully the story continues into the new Jedi Quest books. It's a stunning and thrilling conclusion, and most memorable of all is the haunting last paragraph on the final page of this, the end of the Jedi Apprentice series.	2002-04-26

The strange connection that Mother has to Billy is keeping the Remnants alive, but Billy can't bargain with the powerful machine forever. A decision has to be made -- should she be trusted, or should she be left alone, which will possibly create more dangers for the group? As Billy tries to understand the torment raging inside Mother's mind -- if it has one -- it seems as if there are Remnants who want to destroy not only Billy, but all the other Remnants as well. These mysterious people, living in secrecy but obviously stronger than Jobs and the others, have a dangerous motive and will do anything to stop the other Remnants. But the most hideous intention of all lies in a mind that the Remnants would have never before imagined. Remnants #6: Breakdown is a highly imaginative addition to the series, like the fifth book, and will leave the reader in shock for the seventh book, Isolation. It's fast-paced and exciting, once again restoring the Remnants series to the suspense it had from the first book.	2002-04-19

Mattie Stepanek, the young poet and peacemaker who wants to spread peace throughout the world through his poems, returns in Hope Through Heartsongs, a powerful book that speaks through the voice of a young child and reveals the powerful message of hope in many touching ways. It is a book that can be enjoyed by about everyone, not simply because it is a special book, but because it is written by a young and very special person. From age three and beyond, Mattie's poems reflect positive and sometimes sad meanings, in which he wants people to understand the simplicities of life with a newer, more hopeful meaning. The poems are all written with power and feeling, and they are very  touching in their own ways. It is obvious that he is very gifted person who views his suffering as a message more than as pain. My favorite poems in this book were &quot;Beyond the Pain&quot;,Possession&quot;<BR>and &quot;Only One&quot;, just a select few of some of the powerful poems that can be found in this book. Mattie's poems also speak about the subjects of terrorism, and more so on the recent national tragedies in some of his poems. Hope Through Heartongs must be read especially if you have read his previous two books, Heartsongs and Journey Through Heartsongs. But even if you haven't read any of Mattie Stepanek's previous Heartsongs books, Hope Through Heartsongs will still manage to capture your heart and amaze you with the brilliance and wisdom of a person who, someday, may accomplish the dream of worldwide peace through the messages he has presented in his three wonderful books.	2002-04-02

Jess is starting school with the hope that she'll finally have a better image -- such as not not fighting all the time and being a little more toned down. But, of course, Jess can never hope to ever have a good life, because as soon as she arrives in school, everyone is blaming her for the murder of a cheerleader that took place just a day before school. Jess discovers that she's being blamed because everyone knows that she's \\"Lightning Girl\\" and should have done something with her powers to stop the murder, and that it was her fault that the student was murdered. Jess still wants to keep her identity secret, naturally, and she'd rather have it that her psychic powers aren't know to anyone. But when it starts to become obvious that the killer will strike again, Jess realizes that she must use her psychic abilities to stop the murders once and for all, if she isn't killed in the process. Jess is determined to keep her secret but also stop the murders from happening again, and yet, little does Jess realize that she's being stalked as well. Safe House, the thrilling third book of Jenny Carroll's 1-800-Where-R-You series, is a refreshing blast of a book, and while it's a serious plot, it still has some hilarious moments in the witty writing that Jenny Carroll is famous for -- if you've read The Mediator series, then the three books of the 1-800-Where-R-You series are no doubt just as fun and enjoyable to read.	2002-04-02

Evan won't reveal what's going on in their place, but Cam and Alex know that it's something deadly. As they try to unlock the mysteries, they're also suspicious that Thantos has followed them, after encountering a gruesome experience that must be linked to Thantos. But another mystery remains unclear in Montana, and that is the mystery of their pasts. Are Cam and Alex ever going to discover the truths that have always been so mysterious to them, especially now -- if they even survive Montana? T*Witches #4: Dead Wrong is the mysterious fourth book in the series, and has an intense plot until the end. Although it's the shortest book yet in the series, its thrills and revelations have made it my favorite book in the T*Witches series. I can't wait for the fifth book, which will no doubt be even more shocking.	2002-03-25

Katya and her mother, however, live in luxury -- their home is with the Tsar and the Empress, and their four daughters -- Olga, Tatiana, Marie, and Anastasia -- and the ailing Alexei.

As the years pass by, the luxurious Russia is thrust into the inevitable war that would mark itself in history. Katya knows she is no longer safe, even behind palace walls with her best friend, Anastasia --and finds that she must do something to try to stop the war. Angel On The Square is powerful historical fiction that deals with the wins and losses of revolution, what it means to care, and what maturity is all about.I felt strongly for Katya and for Russia as I read this book, and reading about the Grand Duchesses and their family, mostly Anastasia, through young Katya's eyes, is touching and the descriptive is beautiful. Until its last astounding page, this book was excellent.	2002-03-15

Lena lives with the fear that she will constantly be killed by those who will do anything to stop her, but she also lives with a fiery determination that is like Tahl's.

It's up to Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to protect her even more than they had imagined.

Obi-Wan disguises himself as part of Vorzyd 4 to see if what they're up to is all for a good cause. It could be more dangerous than they know they're getting into, and he works alone to uncover the truths. Does this small group of fighters know what they are trying to succeed in -- or are they only making it worse for their world? Jedi Apprentice #18: The Threat Within, the last serially numbered book in this series, is sadly disappointing and doesn't measure up to either its anticipation or to its previous books. It offers little interest and is short, but is  very good when it comes to drama and the story of what will eventually become of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. I can't wait for the series conclusion, Special Edition #2: The Followers, and it will hopefully be better than this.	2002-02-21

She has Anthony and has found the freedom of being alive after so many deadly encounters. Now, as she prepares to move on in high school and make more friends, the betrayal of Yana will forever live in her mind -- a betrayal that was deeper than anything Rae could have ever imagined. But those thoughts don't even compare to when Aiden returns and tells Rae and Anthony that Yana has escaped prison. Rae knows just how deadly Yana can be -- she knows the hatred and rage burning inside the mind of the girl who used be her best friend. She knows that Yana is the most dangerous person in the world to her. And she also knows that her powers -- the ability to read thoughts through a person's fingerprints -- may not be able to help her this time. Can Rae get yet Yana to discover the truth before it's too late -- even if that will be the hardest thing to do? Rae has seen and faced unbelievable battles in her life ever since her powers to read fingerprints started. But the battle she now faces may be the most ultimate battle of all. Fingerprints #7: Payback is the long-awaited and excellent conclusion of Melinda Metz's powerfully absorbing Fingerprints series. I am going to sorely miss this series, from the first spellbinding book to its worthy conclusion, as a series that has a special place in the hearts of readers everywhere. Fingerprints is among the most extraordinary series out there, and in only seven books, it has turned into a masterpiece.	2002-02-08

And is this virtual world only a game - or does it hide a deeper motive? Replica #21: Virtual Amy is a very good and intriguing addition to Marilyn Kaye's unique Replica series. It is a more mature and important book, and I can't wait to read the upcoming Plague Trilogy. Readers who though the series has grown 'babyish' may  find that this book deals with more mature matters and deepens the mystery of the entire series.	2002-02-03

But there's Michael Meducci, whom Suze is having a hard time getting around. Michael Meducci is a prodigal geek, but he's very different than what he appears. He tends to have a split personality -- and a split look. Suze is very interested in Michael's behavior, and she also has to deal with the four high school students, who were called the &quot;RLS Angels&quot; where they came from. Suze thinks she's gotten everything under control, but she is in for a lot of danger -- and so are those she loves and cares about. The Mediator #3: Reunion was undoubtedly the most page turning and funniest book in Jenny Carroll's witty and scary series, but not the best. This series is so thrilling and so much fun to read, I don't want it to ever end.	2001-08-19

Milla, who is now a leader of her Icecarl people, must find a way into the Castle, with the alliance of the Rebel Underfolk who will stop at nothing to destory the Chosen's Castle. Tal must find the Empress and inform her of the hideous plan that the evil and mysterious Sushin may unleash -- but what he finds will change everything. The two children are no longer in the safety of their homes, and they are no longer under the shadow of those protecting them. As the battle heats up into extraordinary danger for the both of them, they will have to fight by themselves -- until the bitter end. The Seventh Tower #5: Into Battle is an exciting addition to Garth Nix's wonderful series, but I still liked Aenir and Above The Veil slightly more than this, Into Battle. The wait for the sixth and final book in the series, The Violet Keystone, will not be easy; Garth Nix managed to please yet again with the fifth book in the exciting Seventh Tower series.	2001-08-19

Luke, JJ, Ian, Will, Charla, and Lyssa have survived against all odds after being shipwrecked by a dangerous storm. But they're not alone -- deadly enemies lurk in the shadows, and the kids have even run into a terrifying revelation hidden on the island.  And Will is dying. There's a slight chance of saving him, but it will be likely to kill him as well. There's only one plan to escape the island -- and it's the biggest risk the kids have to face. They don't know if they can go along with the dangerous plan, or if Will can be saved. And they've never been more terrified before. Island #3: Escape is the exciting conclusion to Gordon Korman's adventurous trilogy, and the best of the three in my opinion. The writing and plot were better than the first two books by far; this trilogy is great for adventure and humor for all Gordon Korman's readers alike.	2001-08-19

And he knew that Bruck had never been a friend to him - in fact, he was a dangerous enemy who had turned to the Dark Side with Qui-Gonn's former rival, Xanatos. Now, twelve long years later, his Master is dead, and his own Padawan, Anakin, is at his side. Bruck's death is long forgotten, but the memory of his remorse still haunts Obi-Wan.  But little does he know that those who still remembered Bruck's &quot;murderer&quot; are still vengeful and bent on anger - anger that may cost Obi-Wan and Anakin their lives. This Special Edition of the Jedi Apprentice series, Deceptions, was a powerful and gripping addition to the series, and very long. It wasn't the best, but definitely one of them - and the writing was fabulous, as well as the unforgettable characters Jude Watson always knows how to carefully formulate and position in this wonderful story. Those that have read the past thirteen books in the Jedi Apprentice series should not miss this special story.	2001-07-19

Barron's deepest and most harrowing novel of The Lost Years Of Merlin shines with wisdom and adventure, and it is impossible to put down. The Mirror Of Merlin continues the epic story that began with The Lost Years Of Merlin, The Seven Songs Of Merlin, and The Fires Of Merlin - and it is one not to be missed. When there is a strange disturbance in Fincayra, something too deep and dark to know,  Merlin, joined by the deer woman  he loves, Hallia, journeys to the Mirror deep in the Haunted Marsh, where the shadowy and unhelpful Marsh Ghouls reside. The Mirror, a mirror of deep magic and deep fears, is able to pull its looker through into a world of the future, an alternate reality both haunting and dangerous  that just may doom its captor. And when Merlin finally does look through the Mirror, he finds someone he never expected to find, as well a grim prophecy that is locked in mystery - and the future he finds just may be the one he only saw in dreams...or nightmares. The Mirror Of Merlin is the gripping fourth novel in the five-book saga. Written extraordinarily and breathtakingly, just like the first three, it is poetic, deep, and wondrous.	2001-07-16

With the Treasures of Fincayra safely kept hidden in the land, he sets out with the wondrous Flowering Harp to restore beauty and color to the grey, barren land. But a new journey awaits him, one that he hopes can somehow help him find the cure to him dying  mother. Joined by Rhia, Merlin must survive a harrowing adventure, and hopefully gain wisdom through the Seven Songs Of Wizardry that will enable him to enter the Otherworld.

Barron's deep and epic sequel to the first novel in this saga, The Lost Years Of Merlin, the inner journey of Merlin isastounding and the writing is fabulous. Full of beauty, wisdom, and wondrous power, The Seven Songs Of Merlin is a sequel that will win the hearts of readers everywhere. The quest of Merlin lives on, and furthurs more into what I can't wait to read: the third book in the quintet, The Fires Of Merlin.	2001-07-16

Winter's Longest Night spells ultimate and eternal doom for all of Fincayra -- and no one, not even powerful Merlin, can stop fate. As Rhita Gawr leads a mighty army to come forcibly through the Otherworld into the Mist beyond the land of Fincayra, Merlin faces a decision that will mean the fate of Fincayra's people. Though his greatest and most powerful enemy approaches and bursts through the magical land, Merlin must reunite all of the Fincayrans to fight a great battle against Rhita Gawr's forces. But a murderous man known only as Sword Arms hunts down only children of the land, and Merlin must save all the children of the land, too -- a task that is more difficult than it can ever seem, because the land is slowly fading away into nothingness, and the evil forces push through to annihiliate Merlin's dreams, hopes, and all he has protected and fought for to live. While battle rages and the friends and enemies become what they are not to Merlin, startling truths are revealed, as well as the destiny of what will become of Merlin and his people -- if they can draw the courage to live through the horrible battle that will soon arise. The Wings Of Merlin is the fifth and final spellbinding novel in the extraordinary Lost Years Of Merlin saga by T.A. Barron. Every question, from the first book through the last, is at last answered -- and it is the most heart pounding, shattering, and utterly rewarding novel in the saga. It's a rarity among the hundreds of young adult fantasy novels out there ; the five-book epic, especially this startling and powerful conclusion, should be read by anyone.	2001-07-16

Though I enjoyed this wonderful third novel of The Lost Years Of Merlin saga, The Fires Of Merlin, very much, I enjoyed its two predeccors, The Lost Years Of Merlin and The Seven Songs Of Merlin, more than this novel. It is another five-star masterpiece from T.A. Barron continuing the fantastic and magical epic, and is perhaps the most frightening of them all. When the ancient dragon Valdearg awakens after centuries and threatens to use his wrath against the land, Merlin realizes he is the only one who can try to stop the powerful beast. Reluctantly journeying to destroy Valdaerg, he faces the frightening prophecy that whoever will kill the dragon will die as well. He has gained not only strength but wisdom through mastering the Seven Songs Of Wizardry, and with this wisdom, he hopes to guide himself to surviving the power of this dragon as well as overcoming it. And yet through all the powers and magic and fires that lurk everywhere in Merlin's destiny, there still remains a power that no one can fathom : for it is a Power still higher, one that no one can dream of. T.A. Barron's third and epic continuation to this wonderful saga emanates with magic and power, and through each book, the young wizard Merlin grows deeper in strength, power, wisdom, and most importantly -- in his heart. It is absolutely gripping and page-turning, and a wonder to read.	2001-07-16

But as Gaia decides to move on with her life, Ed and Heather's relationship becomes more serious, and Sam is depressed with his life. Nothing will prepare Sam for the blow that is about to come to him. Fearless #11: Trust was an exciting addition to the Fearless series, but not one of the best. This is the book where the characters begin to fall apart, and where enemies and friends merge and separate. However, Gaia acted a little naive, which was unusual of her.

Meanwhile, Loki deviates a hideous plan to try to escape from prison -- a plan that he hopes can enable him to get his hands on Gaia. Will Gaia ever be normal again... no matter how hard she hopes? Fearless #15: Tears was both happy and sad, a heart-stopping addition to the Fearless series that I couldn't put down.

She had great friends last year, like Rachel -- but that was until the fateful end of the summer when she called the police at a party to arrest a boy in her school, Andy. Though no one knows the truth of why she made the phone call, she is hated and looked down to by every student in her school. Melinda can't speak up for herself -- her heart wants to, but her thoughts stir her not to speak. Even though her year is going rough and her ex-friends are horrible to her, she endures it even as they continue to break her heart. Soon it begins to shatter all that she does in school -- her relationships, her grades, her attitude, her abilities. Will Melinda simply break apart at the year's end... or can she, at last, pull out the courage to speak for defense? The decision will be one that may shatter it all, a choice too much for her to fathom. Speak, a novel by Laurie Halse Anderson, was a powerful, emotional, and tense novel, breaking out with feelings and expressing so much. It was humurous sometimes, in areas that I couldn't stop laughing. Readers will laugh and cry along with Melinda, a character the author has created to be drawn to your heart and admire for what she feels and expresses. Though I liked Fever 1793, the author's other novel, a historical adventure, better than this, I was deeply absorbed in this utterly powerful novel, Speak. I highly recommend it, especially to those who have read Fever 1793.	2001-07-05

Their only way of surviving is by depending on the other, and by doing the work themselves - though it is becoming an almost impossible task. There's still the haunting thought  that the other two kids, Lyssa and JJ,  never survived - or even worse, what if they are still alive,  trapped in the ocean? The four kids may never know the answer, and that may be even more disturbing. And when the island they find themselves on appears more than it seemed at first, there may be even more danger in store for them ; because are they truly, to their knowledge, alone?

They'll have to save each others' lives no matter what, because if they lose even one kid's life, there may never be hope in store for them in the terrifying sea. Island #1:Shipwreck is the heart stopping and funny adventurous first book in this amazing new trilogy by the wonderful Gordon Korman. Though it is more of a serious adventure story, Gordon Korman, who I'm not surprised at, added some hilarious humor here and there in the story.

Dangerous, rich,  brilliant, and intelligent, Artemis likes the way he can handle things - and while his mother is out sick, oblivious of Artemis' s dastardly plots, Artemis has got the life and loving it of being a brilliant criminal. With his burly caretaker so rightfully named `Butler', he's determined to capture Fairy Gold - but that plan, brilliant as it is, becomes an adventure. He'll do anything it takes to get the loot, even if it means capturing an armed and dangerous fairy, Holly Short, of the LEPracon Unit. And Artemis Fowl just may have more of an adventure in store for him - because what he's taken on is something he just may not have a brilliant plan for. Artemis Fowl is an enchanting, dark, and funny story about a child prodigy whose brilliance makes the reader laugh out loud. The way he handles things and talks to armed people is funny, because he's so determined and emotionless. Though it's written very unusual, and with many funny and heart stopping scenes, this novel is not at all like Harry Potter ; while waiting for the fifth Harry Potter, be sure not to miss this one, however. Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl are unique in each of their own magical ways. They shouldn't be compared. Eoin Colfer did a great job on this first riveting magical novel, and so did J.K.

With the departure of Animorphs in May 2001,  The Mayflower Project is the beginning of a dark new series that begins with a promise that is sure to replace the hearts of Animorphs fans everywhere.

The final installment in Kate Thompson's fantastic fantasy Switchers trilogy, Wild Blood, was a little disappointing, and a bit boring. The story was just weak and not very suspenseful, and the plot kept repeating itself through the chapters. But I congratulate the author on writing this novel very well, and she constructs her paragraphs very beautifully. But, I had higher expectations in the conclusion of this wonderful trilogy. I recommend the Switchers trilogy to all fans of the Animorphs series, but though you may find the plot similiar, this trilogy is actually very different, and unique in its own way.	2001-06-01

Garth Nix, author of the wonderful fantasy series The Seventh Tower, is a literal master of fantasy in his first and epic novel Sabriel. He creates a world different than ours with elaboration and stunning characters against a vivid backdrop of a classic, epic story. Using the masterful fantasy like Philip Pullman creates and an epic story that follows my favorite author as well, Garth Nix has written a fabulous novel destined to be a classic. Eighteen year old Sabriel is a prefect, but she knows that someday she must follow in the path of her destiny. Her father, the Abhorsen, disappeared when she was younger, as if she had been abandoned. But when she learns her father is trapped amidst the World of the Dead, she journeys to save him and, with the help of some friends, she faces foes and creatures that only a necromancer like she must learn to drive away. With a world of life and a world of dead that surround her as if one was above her and the other below, she must battle a great and powerful foe: the darkest soul, a Dead, Kerrigor: A foe so dark and unfathomable, Sabriel just may not survive... Garth Nix writes a beautiful and enchanting young adult fantasy novel that I recommend towards ages thirteen and up. Readers of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy and T.A.

But misfortune won't soon fail to find them, and with the absence of their friends, they will soon endure possibly their most miserable time ever as they stay in the luxururious, grand mansion of Esme and Jerome Squalor, one of the wealthiest couples around (Esme being the City's<br />Sixth Most Important Financial Advisor, thank you very much.) Sent to live with the rich couple at 667 Dark Avenue, they may soon find themselves in their darkest experience yet. Esme seems overly concerned about styles and auctions, and what's &quot;in and out&quot;. More mysteries continue to surround them, and people everywhere are both trusting and suspicious. As they try to find Count Olaf and his more than dastardly scheme, and as they try to even make their own elevator through the mansion, nothing will prepare them for the misery that awaits -- and will V.F.D. ever be answered? Can the Quagmires be found? And can they avoid a dark conspiracy? The Ersatz Elevator, the sixth hilarious and miserable tale in Lemony Snicket's Series Of Unfortunate Events, was not as good as the fifth, The Austere Academy, but I did like it very much, and the villains are more than sneaky in the events of the Baudelaire orphans' unfortunate lives.	2001-05-27

David, Christopher, April, and Jalil -- four teenagers with absolutely no idea that their lives would forever be turned upside down, defying all the knowlege they had always believed. It was all because of Senna, the mysterious girl David took a liking in, a mistake he wishes he could never have done. But everyone wishes they could never do a mistake. But this mistake will forever change the four teenagers' lives, thrusting them into a fantastic, mythical world that only existed in dreams -- and nightmares. Senna was swallowd up into the Earth in front of David's eyes, and in a split second, she was gone. David tried to save her -- but not without somehow getting his other three friends into the mess, and now the world they had grown up in for sixteen years is a distant memory. As they desperately search for Senna, they will meet creatures and beings they could have never fathomed of seeing, like Fenrir and Loki and Vikings. Nothing will prepare them for Everworld, a world<br />that will always be more of a horror then a fascination in the kids' minds. K.A. Applegate, author of the enormously popular Animorphs series, and the soon to be futuristicly dark new series Remnants, takes the reader into a whole new breathtaking fantasy world that begins with the heart stopping first book: Everworld #1: Search For Senna. The suspense and action never waver, and the mystery is so intense Everworld won't ever leave the mind of the reader.	2001-05-27

Tess is a Switcher -- someone who can take on the shape of other animals as freely as they choose, until the age of fifteen, when all Switchers must decide what animal they choose to remain as for the rest of their life. Ever since the terrifying but thrilling adventure with Kevin, another Switcher, in the Arctic, Tess has been pretty lonely since she last saw him. But her world changes once again when Kevin, in the form of a phoenix, is captured. Tess has no way to save her best friend, and she fears the worst will happen. And when she meets a deathly pale, mysterious boy her age named Martin, who is a Switcher, too, she becomes introduced to a terrifying power and a heart of darkness that will rule both her and Martin forever if she can't control her desire on time. The frightening world of the vampires is soon introduced to her through Martin, and there's even more to Martin then she could have ever dreamed. As her fifteenth birthday draws closer, she must decide her future. But will that future be an eternity of something good or evil? In this gripping and powerful sequel to Kate Thompson's thrilling novel Switchers, the author writes with a brilliant emotional writing and measures up to this novel's predecessor. However, I enjoyed Switchers more then this, Midnight's Choice, but this novel was still a wonderful read and the author could not have made a better sequel.	2001-05-25

When the world was hit by a meteor many years before, the world itself forever changed. Society reformed, but into a different position and with different forms of new breeds of people created by the devastating blow of the meteor. Thus began a new people, different in looks but still maintaining human characteristics and features. Leora is one of those called 'Mutants' -- people that were formed by the meteor, often referred to as defectives. She has one webbed hand, a marvelous hand that can perform fantastic gifts for her, the gift to draw things like no one else. Though she is mocked by her people for her defective hand, she defies their mockery and soon sets off on an unforgettable adventure : beyond the Wall, where all people of her home, Village Fifteen, are forbidden to go. What lurks behind those mysterious walls? What will become of it when she finally has the courage to go beyond the Wall, defying the laws? She soon becomes involved in a battle to save all she knows, and sees wondrous things that no one could have the gift of seeing but her. Leora wants to answer all the mysteries that surround her, but first she must keep herself alive and make the right friends to help conquer what lay ahead of her on her dangerous journey. The Hermit Thrush Sings was an excellent and marvelously plotted and written novel by Susan Butler. Readers of Lois Lowry's poetic novel GATHERING BLUE will no doubt love this wonderful young adult novel. But even if you aren't the type to read such a novel, The Hermit Thrush Sings because it truly is an exception from many, many young adult fiction novels to choose from.	2001-05-20

It's his habit, and it often gets the better of him. He wants to be a millionaire when he grows up, and he can't wait to be one. But in school he likes to compete, too. He can't take the fact that a girl in his class can be so much better then him. So when his teacher asks him to write a diary, he's going to prove that he really can be the best in the class. But when he finds a strange, old diary in his basement, everything changes. This diary can predict the future -- and soon, Alex is winning every bet in the school. His peers think he can predict the future. And he really can -- and it's all because of his mysterious secret diary. Alex wants to get more and more money, but sometimes it's better not to know the future. Because the future can contain very unwanted surprises. I liked The Nightmare Room #5: Dear Diary, I'm Dead by R.L. Stine, but it wasn't the best because of the ending. That was just too expecting of R.L. Stine, reflecting his poor Goosebumps writing. But it was still very enjoyable, and a lot of fun to read.	2001-05-20

Child abuse is seen here in this horrific true story like never before in this heartbreaking, encouraging, and painful novel by surviving author David Peltzer. He was just a cute little boy growing up in the golden city of San Francisco, with a loving mother and father and family. Life was sweet, and the family spent their times thrillingly. But when his mother started becoming different, and attitudes around the family began to change, soon everything began to slowly fall apart. Horribly abused, unimaginably mistreated, the child David faces an enraged, brutal mother who abuses him for her own sick pleasure. She changed, and became an entirely different person, and brutalized her child like never before. Facing a horrible life, with absolutely nothing to give him hope, the child began to reach into his heart, pulling out courage, pulling out faith he never knew was there, pulling out a somewhat comforting hope to help him hold on and hopefully survive. A Child Called 'It' was a gripping painful story of a boy's courage to survive, and how he faced a mad, brutal mother who slashed pain not just at his body but at his heart to weaken him more then he could imagine. It was heartwrenching and gruelingly horrible to read, and I can't believe how a little boy like David could ever find hope. An absolutely nightmarish, gripping autobiography seen through the eyes of an unimaginably abused child, I DO NOT recommend this to children, as it is a horribly violent and scary novel that is likely to instill a nightmare. But for older readers, it is so encouraging and faithful, it gives you the hope that one so small and vulnerable can somehow survive, with the daring dream that someday he will at last be free of the horror.	2001-05-20

Rachel and the other Animorphs had fought a silent battle with the parasitic Yeerks for years, while the human race remained unaware. But now all that avoiding has changed. The human race is just as desperate as the Animorphs to defeat the Yeerks who will rule Earth forever if they're not stopped soon, and it's come to the final battle against the Yeerks to decide once and for all who will victor in the brutal war -- the Animorphs or the Yeerks. The world is terrified of this revelation that their planet may fall victim to the Yeerks. No matter what happens, Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, and Ax know that if they want to save all they have tried to protect, they have to win this one. No matter what they have to face or give up. Because if they lose, it will be a battle lost that no one can correct. But will this war end in victory or tragedy for the Animorphs? No one knows who will win or lose. And no one knows who will live...or die. K.A. Applegate concludes the fabulous Animorphs series with an absolutely extraordinary and beautifully written finale. I would recommend it to fans and readers of the series everywhere, but I know that you don't have to be told twice to read this last and promising book in the series, Animorphs #54: The Beginning. It's fabulous in more ways then one, being the ultimate last -- and best.	2001-05-16

This is the most tragic book I have read in Lemony Snicket's hilarious A Series Of Unfortunate Events books. The third book, The Wide Window, is probably the most miserable tale of all for the three Baudelaire orphans, and misfortunate just can't stay away from them. When Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are sent to stay with kind old Aunt Josephine in a most unusual house overlooking a hill towering over the watery depths of Lake Lachrymose, home of the venomous Lachrymose Leeches. They don't want to ever encounter their greedy uncle Count Olaf ever again, who has tried to steal their fortune and will never stop until he has it. Just when things look more then unpleasant, their Aunt Josephine mysteriously vanishes into the lake, and the Baudelaires know their poor aunt is a victime of suicide. But the conspiracy that lurks this time for them will be more then sneaky, and now the Baudelaires will have to dodge the greedy hands of a sinister villain once again. This is perhaps the most miserable story in the hilarious series that keeps getting more and more miserable. The author knows perfectly how to make a hysterical but dreadful tale, with a chain of events that will be sure to entertain.	2001-05-13

When her parents send her to stay with her cousins for the summer on a rural farm out state, she realizes that she'll have to make her decision while she's there. But something is disturbing her, and it's something that has to do with the mysterious woods near the farm. As she tries to solve a dark mystery and avoid the rage of her tyrant Uncle Maurice, she becomes involved in ancient web of mystery and intrigue, and soon she is in utter danger. She has to keep herself from danger, but at the same time she has to make the biggest decision of her life. Her powers as a Switcher are almost up, and time is dwindling away. What animal will she choose to stay in forever? And will she ever get to see her fiteenth birthday? The final installment in Kate Thompson's fantastic fantasy Switchers trilogy, Wild Blood, was a little disappointing, and a bit boring. The story was just weak and not very suspenseful, and the plot kept repeating itself through the chapters. But I congratulate the author on writing this novel very well, and she constructs her paragraphs very beautifully. But, I had higher expectations in the conclusion of this wonderful trilogy. I recommend the Switchers trilogy to all fans of the Animorphs series, but the though you may find the plot similiar, this trilogy is actually very different, and unique in its own way.	2001-05-13

They're just about to go on a class trip when the Grand Pant, the smartest genius in all of Stan's home world, Pan, informs them of the trouble that's lurking on Earth. And Stan's own amazing nasal processing powers are weakenning, which is quite a mystery. They know that an alien called the Humongan is stealing the power of the city for some unknown reason, and it's somehow linked to Stan's disfunctioning.  Luckily their class trip is headed right toward New York City itself -- where the Humongan is somewhere hiding. Devin and Stan have to stop the Humongan before Earth is turned literally inside out -- but where can a two hundred foot alien possibly be hiding? It's hilarious laughs and classic funny Gordon Korman in the conclusion of his silly but hysterically enjoyable Nose Pickers From Outer Space series. The story that began with Nose Pickers From Outer Space, Planet Of The Nose Pickers, and Your Mummy Is A Nose Picker concludes with the hilarious fourth adventure of Devin and his unique geek exchange buddy Stan. Gordon Korman has wrote another hilariously charming book, but I recommend it toward younger, fourth-grade audiences. Ultimately,though, this is the silliest book he has ever wrote.	2001-05-07

Stine's best book yet in his newest creepy Goosebumps type series, with a unique twist and excellent story that distinguishes this book from past books. Probably one of his scariest books he's written, and with a story that is sure to keep eyes glued, I loved this story more then any of the others in THE NIGHTMARE ROOM series. Spencer Turner was devastated at the shocking death of his cousin Ian last winter when they were skating on the ice with some friends. Even as Ian fell through the ice, Spencer had tried his best to save him -- but he almost got killed himself trying to do so. Spencer survived, but his cousion Ian did not. Ever since, Spencer wants to contact Ian's ghost and tell him how much he had tried to save him, and how sorry he is of Ian's tragic death. He becomes so desperate that he eventually purchases an item called the Howler from a ghost supplies shop. The Howler is able to make Spencer hear the howls of ghosts -- and even though Spencer is terrified, he'll do all it takes to reach Ian...somehow. But maybe he gets more then he bargained for. The terror that ensues will make Spencer wish he'd never even dream of buying the terrifying Howler. This was a spine-tingling, scary, and page turning book in R.L.

But just as they begin to settle down, they begin to realize just how much trouble they're in. The rules are outrageous. The teachers are outright boring and ridiculous.

MIXED MAGICS is a delightful new short story collection continuing the Chrestomanci saga that Dianna Wynne Jones had woven years ago. Now readers will see the return of the famed Chrestomanci and the magic that emanates from some old characters in CHARMED LIFE and THE MAGICIANS OF CAPRONA. These are four Chrestomanci tales, and though I did not like the first and last story, one story is an extremely suspenseful, magical story that I could not put down. This brand new collection, MIXED MAGICS, includes the stories WARLOCK AT THE WHEEL, STEALER OF THE SOULS, CAROL O'NEIR'S HUNDREDTH DREAM, and SAGE AT THEARE. I particulary enjoyed STEALER OF THE SOULS, for it featured the return of Cat Chant and Tonino from previous novels. Master Spiderman, a shroudy, dark man, wants to be the most powerful nine-lived enchanter in the world -- and that's because he's going to have ten lives. And he's going to kidnap Cat and Tonino to do so ! Can the two join forces to stop the Master? The magic of this story is wonderful, and the book is extremely well written. All Chrestomanci fans, or fans old and new of Dianna Wynne Jones's heartwarming magical books should read MIXED MAGICS, the brand new, magical, and spine tingling short story collection, which will delight many a reader, flashing with spells, laughs, and magic galore, though it has lost the spark of the original four Chrestomanci novels.	2001-04-13

The Yeerks are through with the subtle invasion that they had always kept with from the very beginning. But now that the fight for Earth has completely changed, the invasion is open war. The Yeerks are planning to turn Earth into an enormous Yeerk Pool to serve as the ultimate feeding source, bigger then any pool complex ever made. Before long, the Animorphs and Ax are forced to trust the vile, emotionless creatures they had always thought incapable of any feeling: Taxxons. But it seems that not all Taxxons want to serve the Yeerks. Some don't want to live with the knowledge of an inconquerable hunger. Some just want freedon, if that's ever possible. They too, want the invasion to end.... Animorphs #53: The Answer is the extraordinary second to last adventure of the Animorphs series, with only one more book left. The battle is almost over... one more book is left... and everything Jake and the others have ever tried to save is at stake.

The Fingerprints series begins with a blast, and is excellently written by Melinda Metz, author of the Roswell High series. It explores the dark, insecure world of a frighteneed teenage girl, Rae Voigt, whose fear always locks her away from her friends. Rae always thought she was crazy. Her own mother was, and all her father ever does is tell Rae how special her mother had been before her death. Rae doesn't believe it all. She tries to fit in with her friends, and all she ever wanted was to feel normal. But words, strange, other words, always fill her head. She doesn't know what to think of it. It's a fascinating, extraordinary power she has, to touch things and to know people's thoughts by the fingerprints they leave. She only thinks she's crazier.  But the real terror begins when she touches a fingerprint that reveals that someone is trying to kill her. It will take all her courage to try avoiding an unseen, dangerous enemy -- if she can find it. Fingerprints #1: Gifted Touch is an excellent first book of this great new series , and always leaves you on the edge of suspense, moving the reader and feeling Rae Voigt's uncertain view of the normal but terrifying world that  surrounds her.	2001-04-12

The climax was terribly underdeveloped and boring, reflecting much of the boredom the book had in its entirety. The Dangerous rescue concludes the three part story arc of the series that began with The Deadly Hunter, continued onto The Evil Experiment, and concludes with The Dangerous Rescue. Jenna Zan Arbor will stop at nothing to learn all the secrets and power of the Force, so that she can become more powerful with its secrets. When Qui-Gon Jinn is finally rescued from the dangerous grasp of Jenna Zan Arbor, Jedi Master Adi Galliah, and her Padawan Siri, whom Obi-Wan had sided with previously, have returned to help Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in the dangerous mission. But in order to win over Jenna Zan Arbor, the Jedi Team -- just after freeing another Jedi from the scientist's lab, Noor R'Aya -- must take down the fiercely dangerous<br />Ona Nobis, the deadly opponent they had just barely escaped before. It will take this skillful team of Jedi to face everything -- and everything depends on them. Unfortunately, the book was very lacking in suspense or action, and the beginning was extremely thrilling and then the book's downfall began. The Dangerous Rescue should still be read, for it plays a  pivotal role in the series. I felt the three part story arc was not so exciting, so it is not entirely the book's fault, just the main idea of binding three books with the same continuous story. It was good, but I am starting to get bored with the Jedi Apprentice series, and am disappointed at Jude Watson. There have been better books in the series.	2001-04-10

Stine's popular Goosebumps series -- probably older now -- will like his brand new NIGHTMARE ROOM series, still sticking with the familiar scares (and laughs) type of style. Though I think his 'scares' are quite funny, this book reflects the writing of the Goosebumps series on perhaps just a notch above the old level. My Name Is Evil is the third installment in this series.  Maggie was just an ordinary girl trying to have fun on her thirteenth birthday with her friends. She never really thought she had any evil or darkness in her heart. But that was until she met Miss Elizabeth, the Fortune Teller at the local carnival. From then on, her evil began to get worse, though she can't stop it. The friends she always had are turning against her because of her strange evil powers. Maggie doesn't know what's happening to her, or why she suddenly has evil powers on her thirteenth birthday. Nothing will prepare her for the big surprise in store for her. Before anything else happens, Maggie must do something to stop her evil -- before her world falls apart in front of her eyes.	2001-04-10

Teacher Ben Ross's class just doesn't understand why the Nazis had helped Hitler come to power and why they had been influenced to something so obviously inhumane. He decides to open up a new project, called The Wave -- in which Discipline, Community, and Action is their leading motto. In the beginning it made students feel a part of something , and feel equal to everyone else. But what began with a simple class experiment leads to a terrible outcome -- and soon, The Wave is beginning to take control everyone. But not in the way Ben Ross had directed it upon his students. Based on a true story, The Wave deals with how a person must trust his beliefs but in a way that will not harm others, and how a good cause can lead to a disaster. This was a fairly enjoyable and chilling story by Todd Strasser, and a thoroughly heart rending YA novel.	2001-04-05

THE MAGICIANS OF CAPRONA , though having little to do with the enchanter Chrestomanci, is a thoroughly intriguing novel with the most suspenseful story yet. Tonino and a band of magicians -- the Magicians Of Caprona -- are the only ones who can save Caprona. The magic is wonderful, the characters -- particularly Tonino -- are aptly described and vivid. In this third very enchanting and deep novel of the Chrestomanci Quartet by Dianna Wynne Jones, readers will very much consider this a personal favorite, as I did -- for the story is even more suspenseful then THE LIVES OF CHRISTOPHER CHANT which I thoroughly enjoyed. Though it has littler to do with Chrestomanci, it is in no way an 'add on' to the quartet. This is a must read for all of Jones's fans, as well as fans of Harry Potter, Which Witch, and Half Magic.	2001-04-01

His Uncle Ralph, excited of his nephew's extraordinary powers, begins to send Christopher on missions in his dreams.

In the fourth -- and concluding -- novel of the quartet, humor and fright are in one very involving work. When a mysterious note arrives in a school that 'someone in 6B is a witch' , the class of 6B is frightened.

DETECTIVE STORIES is a wonderful compilation of a few of the best detective stories that have ever been written. Some stories, others elaborate, some puzzling, and some rather comical, this wonderful novel includes mysteries written by legendary detective authors such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Raymond Smullyan, Issac Asimov, Italo Calvino, And Tony Fletcher. The first story, THE SPECKLED BAND, is by Arthur Conan Doyle and features everyone's favorite detective: Sherlock Holmes. It's a little bit of a scary story involving a terrified woman who hears the strange, low whistle is the night air that once killed her sister while she was sleeping. The mystery is deep and dangerous, and chilling. Another personal favorite of mine was THE CROSS OF LORRAINE by Isaac Asimov, which elaborately tells the story of a keen magician who met a woman who disappeared as soon as he took a liking in her. Even he can't find her, and when he tells the story of the vanished lady to guests at a dinner, the plot of the mysterious vanishing thickens. Yet another wonderful mystery is that of FINGERPRINTING A GHOST, by Tony Fletcher. It is a frightening tale that involves the obvious supernatural: taking the fingerprints of a mysterious ghost that appears and reappears in an old house in order to solve a mystery. These are just some of the mysteries available in this great novel selected by my favorite author, Philip Pullman, who also wrote the wonderful HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy and the thrilling Sally Lockhart mystery trilogy. It even has one very silly and comical story just for fun in case the reader has had too many serious reads. Any detective story fan shouldn't miss out on this thrilling read, perfect just before bed when it is at the peak of its fright.	2001-04-01

Obi Wan and his Master, Qui Gon Jinn, embark on a challenge to restore peace between the planets Rutan and Senali. The two planets are thinking of war, and betrayal is in the air. When Qui Gon and Obi Wan try to balance the anger of the two kings of Rutan and Senali, the Prince Leed has been mysteriously taken. The mysteries eventually reveal a much more dangerous threat. Together, Qui Gon and Obi Wan must restore the shattered peace and reunite a lost bond. Less enjoyable in the series, one of the negatives of this book was that Obi Wan merely watched everything unfold, while Qui Gon was the true hero. This series gets better and there have been better books, so even if The Shattered Peace was not as enjoyable it should still be read, as it plays a major role in the series. An unexpected twist towards the end is nice and the book altogether is not too bad.	2001-03-08

In the second thrilling novel of Philip Pullman's Sally Lockhart mystery trilogy, both suspense and terrifying intrigue are thrust into a spectacular but heartbreaking adventure that makes The Shadow In The North so intense. Sally Lockhart, now twenty two and still bold and daring, has a settled life of her own, and as an honest business she becomes widely known for her trust in other people's investments. Now there's word about a company called North Star Castings , who is said to be stealing people's investments and developing secrets that are bound to be destroying people's lives. Sally needs to get to the bottom of this mystery, along with the help of her old friends, Fred and Jim. But the danger she puts herself into is terrifying. Sally begins to unravel a mystery so twisted and evil, she alone may not be able to save her future, and everyone else's. For the lurking danger is so great and conspired, it will cost more then Sally Lockhart could have ever dreamed. Written with the absolute clarity and beauty Philip Pullman has elaborated, The Shadow In The North is darker and more powerful then what I enjoyed thoroughly, The Ruby In The Smoke. The mystery is absorbing and deep, and the heroine Sally Lockhart is unforgettable. I can't wait to read the conclusion of this thrilling trilogy, The Tiger In The Well.	2001-03-06

With The Ruby In The Smoke, the reader falls in love with Sally Lockhart's daring personality and will want to read the next two books. I can't wait to read Book Two, The Shadow In The  North. And like a ruby in the smoke, the story shrouds itself in powerful mystery with an ending so beautiful and satisfying. Philip Pullman's first novel is one that will impress many; his true talent is seen in The Ruby In The Smoke (I am certain the other two books in the trilogy are even more gripping) and The His Dark Materials trilogy, and he is unsurpassable at that.	2001-01-28

Avi is a unique and special author whose books are promising and delivering, but Perloo The Bold isn't one of his boldest books -- I found it boring and not really interesting of who would succeed in the war between Perloo and his enemies. While the book reflects a beautiful grammar, Avi seems to lose his touch in his interesting plots -- even the wonderful grammar could not save this book, and I really was surprised at such a prestigious author who has won many awards and whose books speedily get checked out in the library. Perloo The Bold will no doubt interest readers or disappoint them horribly ; in spite of this book's low quality, I recommend it -- for certain parts will satisfy, though many will not.	2001-01-25

HOLES, written by the legendary author Louis Sachar, tells the story of a young misjudged  boy , Stanley Yelnats, who is sent away to a juvenile detainment camp where bad kids are forced to dig holes every day -- where discipline rules with an iron fist, and water is precious and given rarely . The kids Stanley meets there are in every way different from the next, and as Stanley becomes more accustomed to the camp's strange, unknown reason as to why they must  dig holes -- he begins to understand the kids -- and see that each one is in the camp for reasons he could never be. But he won't stop at one  thing -- the mysterious reason of digging the holes. The clues lead to more answers, and as Stanley digs deeper to the truth, he makes a friend -- and a discovery -- that dreams could only level with. In this powerful novel that is rich in written expression and in storyline, the characters touch the heart and the reader will not want to put the book down. HOLES is one of my favorite novels of all time ; it is deserving, and it is a mesmerizing feat in literature that will never disappoint.	2001-01-25

I Was A Rat is a strange story, indeed, but Philip Pullman brings the story to life as soon as the story begins, already riveting and satisfying. A mischievous young boy is found claiming he's a rat, and tries his best to do so by eating anything placed before him. At first , no one believes this crazy story -- but as it deepens, people are beginning to believe the boy is not human but a foul, monstrous beast. Only three people out of thousands can realize the truth -- and show that a monstrous personality can never change a human. Philip Pullman shows who is human and who isn't -- for a human heart is there and not venom. Touching and exciting both at once, I Was A Rat will deliver laughs and tears at the same time -- remember , this is Phillip Pullman , and with his books, that will always be possible.	2001-01-21

The characters are weak, which is unusual in Philip Pullman's writing -- unlike the His Dark Materials trilogy, the characters are too rushed tn personality and the story jumps right at the start. The plot, although very well thought out, is disappointingly short and makes me wonder if Philip Pullman ever wrote the story. Lila's journey to learn the secret of firework making is far too rushed and roughly a follow-up of Lyra's amazing adventure in THE GOLDEN COMPASS. I expected more in this book , and although it is a very satisfying read for younger readers, most of Philip Pullman's readers may end up being disappointed. Philip Pullman had done far better and has crafted ingenious stories such as HIS DARK MATERIALS trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass), of which The Fireworker Maker's Daughter is virtually INCOMPARABLE to. I know that Pullman has done far better, and continues to do so -- his other books are marvelous, full of plots that are masterfully crafted and beautifully written. Every author has his or her one disappointent ; in The Firework Maker's Daugher, this was the case.	2001-01-21

It's amazing, though, how such a short series could be one of the best series out there. 2099 is one that won't be forgotten ; the entire saga, is one that anyone must own. From<br />the amazing first book DOOMSDAY to the suspense- driven TRAITOR to the astonishing and surprising end of FIRESTORM, the series has its twists and turns that are unforgettable. I hope Mr.Peel continues this series somewhere later on, at least to write Books 7 and 8 which anyone can be sure they'll be amazing. What happened with 2099 is special ; only a man like Mr.Peel, and his imagination, can do that to a series.	2001-01-14

Morphing cheetahs was very well described ; this was the falsgship of the book. But it still could have been worse. And while we see that Rachel is pure anger and recklessness, we see that from time to time one of the Animorph characters breaks through. It is not one of the best of the series, and it is not well written either. But at certain points of the<br />book you feel the beauty of what it's like to be a cheetah, roaming through savannah and running beside the enemy to catch him. However this part is in the beginning, making the main plot go to waste in the second and third chapter. But while it's there it's still vivid in your mind. I was looking forward to this book and was a little disappointed in Animorphs #37 ; but it could have been worse, and it is still worth buying. The cover itself is a masterpiece. So if you want action, I recommend this book, but if you want suspense, read the next few books. Books like #38 The Arrival and #39 The Hidden really had you  going to find out what happens ; a book like #37 The Weakness isn't like that, but the book itself is meaningful in one lesson : the value of trust. In order to be a team you need to be able to trust your teammates, and while Rachel made several mistakes taking Jake's place as leader, she learned what trust was and that being the leader isn't just guts and glory. It's about making decisions that mean the difference between life...and death.	2000-11-19

He doesn't know what to make of it anymore. The pressure. The losses. The sacrifices... and then the Drode comes to Jake. And it is then that Jake accepts a seemingly harmless but dangerous deal with the Drode, servant of Crayak. Now the Animorphs don't exist. Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie, Marco, and Ax are just six ordinary kids growing up in a normal situation of life. They don't even know that the Yeerks are out there. They don't even know of the power to become any animal they touch. They don't know anything about the fate of the human race. Because the Yeerks are still out there, and nothing stops them from destroying everything. The world is about to be taken over for good.But yet it &quot;seems&quot; that someone out there has supposedly &quot;stacked a deck&quot;....	2000-10-20

The intrigue, the  emotion, and the complex storyline together with the heart-stopping battles, are what contributed into making Ellimist Chronicles so good. A shocking epilogue will end off The Ellimist's story , or Toomin's story - with a paragraph so unbelievable that your eyes will be raised. It's a fabulous book and I give it six stars if I could.	2000-10-20

Cassie is stranded in the Australian Outback together with the evil Visser Three. She doesn't know how to get back to her place, but she knows that if she doesn't act fast she will meet her end.

But anyway, I absolutely loved The Familiar. The way KA Applegate can create a futuristic Animorphs is amazing. I thought that The Familiar is one of the best books in the series, because it has so much glory in it. The auther fashioned this book to be not JUST #41. She fashined it to be a great , never to be forgotten book. True, the ending is a completely unexpected one -- but doesn't that make it all the <br />more exciting? The Familiar is one of the best books in a long time since August. Now that's worth it.	2000-10-17

KA Applegate has dared to journey into the dark side of the most evil forces ever. Visser One, who controls the body of Marco's mother, is under trial for treason. She must prevail, or else the irrational Visser Three will take her place and kill everything. This is a great book because you know that Visser One is an evil character,and then the author makes you feel sorry for her that she is so close to death.The fact that Miss Applegate can take an evil and make the reader sympathize with the evil is amazing. KA Applegate is a very talented and stressed out author who obviously worked hard on Visser and all of her other non-ghostwritten books. This book will leave the reader in awe and amazement. But when you do finish it, make sure to read #45: The Revelation - for a surprise of what happens to Visser One in her final trial, the trial of all trials.	2000-10-13

I never expected all the things that happened in this book, and the Ellimist Chronicles is so cool.

Ten books ago an Animorphs book had the title of &quot;The Weakness&quot;, for it truly was the weakness of the Animorphs series.Ten books later,&quot;The Resistance&quot;- is the exact opposite. Jake's under tremendous pressure once again- but it's not like in The Conspiracy or The Mutation where he was just irrational. Toby and her Hork Bajir people want to stay and fight the Yeerks. Why ? The Yeerks have discovered their secret valley. There's more plot in this book,though.Jake receives an old and distant diary belonging to his grandfather.It contains lessons and morals he'd learned in the Civil War.Ultimately,though I  won't say why,it will connect with all that is going on...<br />This is probably the best regular Animorphs book in the series so far because I loved the emotion and drama of the book. It's by far my favorite.Get ready for The Resistance...the future of the human race is about to unfold	2000-10-06

For a story arc book which promised lots of cool stuff, well, so far, changes have happened in the awesome #45 The Revelation, The Ellimist Chronicles, and #47 The Resistance (which is the latest book;it's really good.)The Deception was horrible,and had no point.I think the reader below this one is 100% right.Nothing happened...nothing! Action,yeah, like #37 The Weakness, but  it was worthless. KA shouldn't have wrote it if she knew that it would turn out this bad.It sounded like a great book, but it's a real disappointment.	2000-10-05

Although his other books are not fiction and are written and by children and rewritten by the author, this is his very first and only fiction book.I loved That's Me,Tzviki Green ! so much I nearly cried over it.It is a warm,emotional,action-packed and phenomenal book which I love to read over and over again.His wonderful bestsellers include all eight of his books: KIDS SPEAK , MORE KIDS SPEAK , KIDS SPEAK 3, KIDS SPEAK 4 (brand<br />new) , OUR HEROES, LISTEN TO THE SOUL!, SUBJECT TO CHANGE... and, of course,this novel.I recommend it to anyone of all ages, because I know you'll love it.It's a book made to love.Chaim Walder,you're a genius!	2000-10-02

The whole book is full of action,and Ax isn't himself AT ALL in this book.In fact,he does something very not nice which I won't reveal.But besides that,Visser Two is absolutely an imcompetent fool.Really.How could he be Visser Two,the second highest rank, if he's so ruthless?I also didn't think much happened in #46. The entire book takes place on a plane.The plot sonded exciting because it's like they make peace between China and the US,but it has almost nothing to do with China,only a small part of it. The author took an immense plot and crammmed it stressfully into the shortest book in the series,a character we always liked because he was funny but now readers just might hate him;and, it ends too fast as you'll see.It just looked so good,and I'd been looking forward to it a lot.I'm sorry if I ranted too much; it's what I think.If you don't agree,well,okay.But if you agree with me,well...don't you see my point?It just wasn't a good book at all.	2000-09-28

This short 135 page book made up for it by being really,really good--I think this this is the second best ANIMORPHS book since September, next to the legendary VISSER.This book,narrated by Tobias,involves joining sides  with Tobias's old and hateful enemy,Taylor.And they also morph Taxxons,whic  sounds yucky but is very,very cool!
