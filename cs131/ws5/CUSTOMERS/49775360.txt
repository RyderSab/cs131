These are essentially just breakouts based on bar patterns with the occasional indicator for confirmation.  In addition, there are backtested results for each of them that are eye boggling if true (75-90% win, 3 to 1 minimum).  I figured there's considerable curve fitting and many hours of computer scanning to find profitable patterns.  This isn't necessarily bad, and given as these patterns are all fairly long term..   few people would actually care to stomach the stops necessary to trade it.  Interesting, nonetheless .. and again if these backtests are even 75% accurate, you are looking at some amazing setups.	2003-08-22

Target audience is on par of those reading Elder's Trading for a Living.  Teaches a little bit of everything, but nothing very well.  An advanced trader should literally be able to flip through the book, look at the charts and infer all that is necessary from this book.

Presented sort of like a flip book, where the next page is the chart with one more day's bar.  There would be commentary about the wave structure and the author would advise on where he would have entered or exited.  Unfortuantely, it was somewhat confusing ..  the wave counts were often ambiguous and needlessly complicated.  Weis seems to be the excessive EW analyst and may turn off many traders.

The author presents 3 methods, which are probably fairly well known, but to have it clarified and presented with examples certainly would help a trader add another tool to their box.

I did notice he used Dynamic Trader for his charting examples, yet failed to mention a thing about Elliott Wave in his methods.  The book is simple to read, very much like a Larry Connors style of book.  Presents 8 methods, many of them overlapping each other in theory and setups.  Basically, trades off confluences of a particular fib retracement (essentially a Wave 4 retracement) and then gives simple fib targets.  A trader would gain the most from this book by having an EW background and then interpreting the setups to incorporate with wave counts.  Otherwise, I think a new trader might look too hard for a \\"higher high\\" and so forth, just to match the setup.	2003-08-11

Anyone familiar with chart patterns - h&s, wedges, flags, triangles, trendlines will likely find nothing new in this book.  Also, the explanations are a bit wordy ..  though I suspect this was necessary when no one was familiar with it.  I give it 3 stars for content and another for the fact that it was written in 1932.

Elliott's Market Letters: 1938-1946	Books	2	14	16	N	N	Hmm	I'm an avid trader using Elliott Wave as my primary basis of market forecasting possibilities and trade off a specific Wave setup.  This book is compilation of Elliott's old subscription based newsletters that teach and predict the market in his time.  Commentary is by Prechter who adds some comments and clarifications at the end of each news letter.  While Elliott is nearly a godlike status in my mind , I found this book is pointless for trading and learning purposes.  Among the many letters and Prechter's annoying hindsight commentaries , you will find bits and pieces of the Wave based principles.  I have found most of the useful information to be very basic Elliott wave, which can be found in Chapter 1 of most any modern Elliott Wave book.  I also did not follow on many of the wave counts, which break many of the well known modern rules.  This is understandable as EW was still in its infancy at the time of writing.  Overall, this book has little or no value to a trader.	2003-07-08

Cycles are almost common knowledge now, with the new wave of time based traders off Fibonacci.  Also, MA envelopes and other variations of bands are incredibly popular now.  I think his real edge is the length of time of the cycles.  Most people will not have the patience to wait months for a setup and then hold on to the trade for several more months.  That allows the longer cycles to go the course, while letting the shorter traders fight over the smaller wiggles.  The claims of 90% winning trades is also questionable, but when you do catch the relative cycle high or low..  it sure does look brilliant.	2003-07-07

I have no idea what this guy's background is, but I have a hard time believing he is a successful trader or even a trader at all.  The author introduces several theories with examples and backtested results in varying commodities.  This sounds ok, except for the part where every single commodity has different variables and he titles his backtests \\"Optimized Results\\".  In addition, he presents his theories in a very vague form that barely even mentions a thing about money management.  Maybe I missed something, but none of the backtested results tells you where he got in or out and I'm presuming they are only profitable just from severe curve fitting.  There are some interesting points in the book, however.  One of the chapters about cycles presents a Cycle Regularity Ratio, which can be simply calculated and provides a quantifiable number to cycle accuracy.  There are also some chart patterns which are introduced, some are just slight variations of classic patterns.  The MicroWorld pattern is very interesting, if only for amusement..   as it would be very difficult to realize in hindsight.	2003-07-06

I realize that Elliott Wave is considered subjective .. but on half of these wave counts, I couldn't see where he was coming up with his numbers.   In addition, he had numerous 7 wave (?) counts and some of his logic is just plain odd.  I consider myself fairly experienced in Elliott Wave, but couldn't figure this guy out for most of the book.  Walker tries to time failures of the C wave and tries to find ends to corrections , but is an aggressive entry method if correct.  The problem is, it is extremely difficult to see .. as corrections can materialize into many forms and stop you out over and over until it presents a discernable pattern.  One thing I did find unique in this book was his use of finding wave counts within simple patterns of OHLC bars.  Seems a bit like overkill, but it is unique nevertheless.	2003-07-01

The idea is that a winning trade is not likely to move very far against you.  A losing trade is likely not to move very far in your favor.  Therefore, one can uses these ideas to construct proper risk management and tweak their methods.  I did find the book to be a bit wordy, often taking several chapters to explain a few points that could be summarized in two lines.  There is also an interesting chapter about using options to hedge your position, rather than relying on stops.   I give this book a strong 3 or a weak 4.  There are certainly some good ideas, but isn't anything to write home about.	2003-06-29

Weintraub magically calculates the pivot, R1, R2, S1, S2 numbers without ever mentioning that they were floor pivots and seemingly takes credit for their value.  He then uses a moving average based on average price on 20 min bars for \\"Day 1\\" , and then a continued moving average for \\"Day 1 + Day 2\\".  When Day 1 approaches or crosses Day 2's MA ..  then you look to trade.  This is where it becomes vague, as you are somehow supposed to determine market direction from these lines and their relation to the floor pivot levels.  Sure, somebody might find this useful and figure out some patterns..  but this is going to be useless trading information for most.	2003-06-26

Kase develops a number of oscillators, stop variation and so forth that are custom to her and requires you to buy it from her webpage .

It's a very quick read, and has some limited trading appeal.  The logic is very similar to market profile and daytraders' pivot numbers.  Price seeks to reach a middle ground \\"pivot\\" - shaped like a bell curve, with the most activity in the middle and least on the extreme ends.  This book throws a whole bunch of stats of percentages of what happened when in particular ranges.  This is similar to market profile, with a vague theory of generalities, and requires you to work with wide stops within zones.  Market profile and floor pivot number traders may find this book useful in linking together a method , but overall .. this book isn't worth buying.	2003-06-23

This is my first exposure to a Jake Bernstein book and I've read many mixed things about him.  Well, after reading most of this book .. I'm glad i now have my own opinions.<br />This book appears to be written for a total beginner futures trader lemming, just waiting to blow out their account.  There is absolutely no substance in this book, nothing to be learned and filled with verbose junk about indicators, patterns and psychology -- typical in most books.  Jake provides numerous so called \\"backtests\\" of various indicator settings with variable moving averages.  Every single system has different settings - which is such an obvious sign of curve fitting.  The only thing I saw of some value was the 3 period high and low moving averages to serve as channels of support and resistance ..  which a trader may be able to modify into something usable, since Jake's version is taught improperly.  <br />I checked this book out from the library and I still feel I got ripped off ..   and it was free.	2003-05-27

There is an above average trader psychology section, but the trading methods are very very basic TA and there is no shortage of self promotion of his webpage and software.  Written and intended for an entry level stock trader, anyone more experienced should pass on this.	2003-05-26

However, if you have not been exposed to some of her so called \\"breakthroughs\\", this may jump start you into further research on your own.  This book is explained with a \\"nagging woman\\" tone - excessively verbose wording of dozens of pages to sum up something that could have easily been explained with two lines and a chart example.  To summarize some methods to see if it may be useful to you:  Fib price projections, trendlines on oscillators, Elliot Wave on oscillators to confirm price, hidden or reverse divergences, filtering out spikes when doing Fib projections or retracements, Gann Wheel theory, volatility bands and curve fitting workable moving averages and oscillators through variable time frames.  Certainly there are a lot of ideas in this book, though terribly explained in most instances.  Whether or not they are even going to make a noticeable difference on your trading is up to you.	2003-05-26

I did find one chapter useful: the economic indicators and expected reactions of missing or exceesing estimates.  Otherwise, the rest of the book covers only the most basic chart patterns, candles and indicators and will be fairly useless to most people.	2003-05-26

Begins with some solid psychological points, that leads into subpar chapters of rules and cliches, and then ends with even worse trading techniques and methods.  These are very basic, very well known and essentially useless trading methods that any respectable trader should already have seen.  Ideally targeted for beginners and filled with hype for various .com webpages and their own Pristine trading service.  The only real good thing I could say is that it is quick and easy to read, despite being an very large book.	2003-05-24

I liked his straight forward, no BS choice of words and his methods of fibonacci confluence does have some merit, but it isn't for everyone.  This is best intended for a swing trader, as daytrading is likely to be too quick paced in order to figure out confluence areas.  <br />There were some vague rules regarding his entry and exit methods with the Fibonacci numbers and when you actually start to apply his methods to your own trading, you will likely be left with more questions than answers.   Not necessarily a bad thing, as all you can really ask from a book is a few new things to try out and see if it applies to your trading.	2003-05-24

Written by John Hill of Futures Truth fame, you would expect a lot of backtesting and system development info - which there is.  As an experienced trader, I did pick up numerous new ideas that might be applicable to my own trading methods and that's really all you can really hope for in any trading book. <br />Some minor gripes are the somewhat lack of clarification and examples at times, relying only on a single chart for an example before moving on to the next idea.  This can be quite difficult to follow for a new trader.  Also, the Drummond Geometry chapter is just a verbatim article that can be found on the Tedtick webpage.<br />Otherwise, this is an excellent keeper book.	2003-05-21

There is one section with 21 traits of successful vs. unsuccessful traders that is worth taking notes on and seeing how you apply to them.  Otherwise, there is very little about trading methods.

Supposedly teaches by showing many examples and situations where you could have done so and so ..       I didn't find any real rules to follow and very few tactics that can be inferred from the examples.  I'm an above average Hearts player and certainly have to say that I did not pick up anything to improve my game in this book.   The best hearts book?  Probably so, but only because there isn't another out there.<br />Dry and painfully boring.	2003-05-08

Maybe I'm not that informed, but the only one of the people were interviewed was Toby Crabel.  Koppel asks the exact same question to every single person with a whole array of varying answers.  To sum it up, nearly everyone had early success, blown out their account, and then recovered.  The revolving theme seems to be that traders need to be competitive, disciplined and have almost an obsessive drive to find a way to make it.  <br />I did find the reading to be a little more interesting near the end with some more insightful interviews.  Overall, there is too much chatting and very much talk about trading.  Therefore, a reader would not expect to find anything all that useful to apply to his own methods.<br />Great sleeping aid.	2003-05-04

Larry has a boring kind of writing style using way too many cliches with a very unique method of trading patterns and fib based relationships.  Those familiar or somewhat familiar with his gartley and butterfly patterns would benefit the most from this book.  Overall, I found some value in this book though it was hardly remarkable.  The price was reasonable and anyone who trades with his methods certainly should have a look at this.  It takes time to see his setups and they don't work at all many times, but it's as close as you'll get a picking tops and bottoms.	2003-04-25

I've never read the first one, so I can't compare and have no opinion on it.  However, I did find this book is be very good.  Gets straight to the point, has a dozen step by step strategies and methods that I'm positive will work with proper money management.  I don't agree with all the theories, nor will I necessarily use these in my own trading.  But, for someone new or looking for short swing type of trading methods .. this one is worth a look.  <br />Pricey, but consider it an investment.	2003-04-24

Lots of chart examples, and explains some variations to his single base setup.<br />One can expect 3 or 4 setups per stock in a year.  Is this the holy grail?  Hardly.  At best, it's an average to above average setup that relies on very solid money management and moves to BE.<br />Assuming a trader can do that, I'm sure it is moderately profitable.	2003-04-17

The publisher is Traders Press, who are known for their over priced books, huge pages, fonts and often minimal content.  This is no exception.  There are 200+ pages in this book, but half of the pages are just charts that may take 3 seconds to look over before moving on.  I finished reading this book in about an hour with little effort.<br />I do like Rudd's style, he gets straight to the point with his pattern setups with very simple (sometimes vague) explanations.  He uses typical TA that we already know - support, resistance, price targets, open, close, high, gap resistances.  Nothing particularly special for an informed trader.  I can't say this is a bad book, the price is reasonable compared to a Joe Ross book and a trader may pick up a thing or two that he isn't aware of.	2003-04-16

They hear what they want to hear, then blank out everything else because it is threatening information.   Shrug.<br />I am well aware of all the solid reviews on this book, so I keep thinking I've missed something in my reading.  I gave the book 2 stars for content, 3 because it was [cost effective].  It is definitely well written by someone who has quite a track record in trading.  The one chapter on Dow Theory, 2B, trendlines and trend reversals was the only one worth mentioning.  The rest of the book is lengthy filler material.  Some good, some bad, mostly \\"average\\".	2003-04-15

This is not for the faint of heart or the trading beginner.  There is a ton of info very well explained and you will need to re-read this several times to truly understand it.  I recommend hand charting your own profiles everyday in a spreadsheet and then analyze what happens when the market opens in the value zone, out of the value zone but in yesterday's range, or completely outside of yesterday's range.   Eventually you will be able to figure out what the current day will \\"look\\" after the day opens with remarkable accuracy.

My advice if you're unfamiliar with these patterns is to go to longorshort. c o m  and read about it for free. Larry has some examples on his own page. There are numerous typos that will make you scratch your head about the editors.

I found that this book had a dozen of typos/grammatical errors as well as some incorrect references to its corresponding charts.  In addition, Nison does not seem to be the most eloquent of writers and at thus making this a potentially \\"boring\\" book to read.

The prize of this book is the Seleznov breakout method, which anyone can use to trade profitably for life.  That alone is worth thousands of times the price of this book.
