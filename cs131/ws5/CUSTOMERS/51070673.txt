I have read several books on Vietnam, but normally prefer to read WWII books.<br /><br />This one really touched me and helped me to see the dedication men have in battle.  When you are reading about men that are shot and have their gun blown out of there hands, so they shoot left handed rather than right, are shot in the throat and can not speak, and still they fight. I was just overcome and moved deeply by the sacrifices these men have continually made.<br /><br />This book has given me such a deep appreciation for our vets, and makes me realize the importance of honoring there sacrifices.  These men were amazing and heroic, and I am glad this book shows a true picture of war for all of those who will never have 1st hand experience, but plenty of opinions.<br /><br />Thank you for your sacrifices!!! And P.S., should any of you go to the Vietnam Wall Memorial in D.C., if you see litter, please stop and pick it up.  Thanks.	2004-11-16
US	51070673	R1JY4OHPEYO3WM	0553586149	481696301	Leave It to Cleavage	Books	4	4	5	N	N	1/2 stars	I have to admit, the first time I tried to read this book, I put it down and forgot about it.  Tonight, I was desperate, you know how it is, there are no good new books out there that you have not read so you go back to a reject pile.  This one was on top, and to force myself to be happy w/it.  I climbed in the tub and brought no other books.<br /><br />Well I have to say, it took me until somewhere around page 20 that I started to get into it, and once I was able to identify with Miranda, I thought it was a great book.  It was fun, (not laught out loud like Katie McCallister,) but very entertaining, more like Susan Anderson.<br /><br />It had a good secondary story going with the Andie, the chief of police's daughter growing up.  The mystery of Tom the cross dressing creep of an ex was handled well.  There was a legitimate build up between Miranda and Blake, and they had a good relationship.<br /><br />I think what I liked best about the  book was the knowledge of running a business, and what they really need to look at.  Ms. Wax did her research, which made it much more beleivable and therefore entertaining.  You could actually beleive that this woman saved her company.<br /><br />Give it a try, I will be reading her new books and trying out her 1st one.  This book seems along the lines of Carly Phillips, so if you like her, get this one.	2004-11-16
US	51070673	R3QEPXRWPTJ41G	0399152059	902551352	Northern Lights	Books	4	13	14	N	N	Liked it Alot, But Didn't Fall In Love With It	Don't get me wrong, as usual, Nora did a great job, but I did not fall in love w/the characters the way I have in some.  My favorite characters of hers have been her J.D. Robb series, w/Eve and Roarke and Finn and Deanna in Private Scandals.  (Not that you can tell those 4 apart, just set in different time periods.)  Nate was great, he just was not \\"it\\" for me.  In some ways I felt we got alot more interaction with other characters and did not have as much one on one time w/Nate and Meg.<br /><br />I have seen in prior reviews that alot of people had trouble w/Meg. I didn't, but then I was willing to take into account that she was raised up hard, in a difficult way of life, and this was her result, she was almost tougher than Nate.<br /><br />While I did not fall in love w/Nate and Meg, I did fall in love with the town of Lunacy, Alaska.  Hobb, the feisty mayor, Bing the cantankerous tow truck driver.  Peach and Otto, (who I personally think need to hook up.)  Peter the young deputy, and pretty shy Rose w/her darling son Jesse.  These characters were well developed and thought out, and I thought the romance was more the love of the town and the way of life.<br /><br />There were some amazing descriptions, and for anyone who thinks they want to go to alaska, I think this will whet your appetite.  This is a mystery book where 2 people get together.  They are normal people w/flaws, there are no super billionaires, or virgins, if thats what you want, hit the historical shelf.  This book has tough characters, and if you skim it you will miss alot.<br /><br />If you are a straight romance fan, wait for the paperback or library.  If you are a fan of mysteries, this one will keep you guessing, and unlike the other reviewers, I found it to be very clear why the murder took place.  It was all about the money, I had a harder time trying to figure out the Star Wars aspect, and still never fully got it, but I am living w/it.<br /><br />I definatley recommend it, if you read the above qualifier and can live with it.  Good reading!you read the above qualifier and can live with it.  Good reading!	2004-10-18
US	51070673	RRZZPKGYA7KIK	0060542128	78002290	When the Storm Breaks	Books	5	3	4	N	N	GREAT DEBUT NOVEL	It seems like because Heather Lowell is the daughter of Elisabeth Lowell, the critics think she should be judged by a different standard than other new writers.<br />I loved this book!  Claire is a strong independent woman, who does not need a guy to rescue her, and can go toe to toe with Sean Richter (OOOH)  who is the dectective in the case.<br />After witnessing a murder, she gets amnesia, and that is where the predictible plot ends.  This woman has good friends, with a strong female relationship and history.  She does not need Sean, but they do complement each other.  When they take a pro active way to find the killer, and she starts dating these guys from the Camelot dating service to see if one of them could be the killer, there are some great moments.<br />Because the killer is never introduced, you can not guess who he is.  HL does a good job w/the suspense.  You want to finish the book, and Claire has a lot of fight scenes herself.  You really root for her.  To me the romance was good, but it was a side story.  It is integral, but I liked the characters so much that the story did not hinge on that.<br />I would purchase this book immediatly if you are a fan or romantic suspense.  This is up there w/Iris Johanson (w/out the conspiracy theories)  If you like Helen Myers, and Kay Hooper you will like this, it does not focus on the people themselves so much like a Nora.  Very good, can not wait for her next novel.  Hope it is Sean's partner Aidan's story.  Really liked him, he seems like he could have some real depth and seriousness beneath his easy going exterior.	2003-08-09

It seems every time she puts out a new book, she exceeds the last one.<br />If you have not read these books yet, you can start with this one, they will stand alone.<br />Talon is great, and I loved that Sunshine was as easy going as she was.  No whining and simpering for her!!  Really HOT love scenes, and lots of them.<br />As usual, set in New Orleans (my favorite spot, wish I would have run into some Peltiers!!) and have to outsmart the Gods.  Love triumphs in the end, so typical in alot of respects, but it isn't.<br />SK, weaves such great strong characters that you see them in your mind while you are reading the books. You can visualize all of this happening, and wish you were there.  I love these stories and can not wait for December for the next one.  This is on my keeper shelf!!!	2003-07-21

By the end of the second chapter, Chloe and Rocco were in bed together (I did not see any chemistry between them, and the sex scenes were really boring and stale.  If I am going to read about it, I want it to be stimulating and well written, these were basic slam bam scenes where they describe her parts with the \\"C\\" word.  Not a big fan of that word.<br />I kept reading, because I have really enjoyed Susan Johnson in the past and I knew that somewhere that I would like the characters.  Never found that, and wish I hadn't wasted my money.  They make no bones about the fact that Chloe likes sex, and she apparently can not go more than 2 days without it.<br />She has sex w/another guy named Colin, (also no chemisty, just a drunk bar p/u of a cute guy)<br />I didn't think the characters were good, I did not think this was well written.  I read erotica, and this was not that!!  If that is what you are looking for, get the Black Lace series.<br />If you are looking for a romance, you will hate this.  They guy ends up with the girl, but I didn't think much of him, and I thought she would be as faithful to him as an alley cat.  If you read the book you will see why.  If you don't read it, consider it time well spent!!	2003-07-21

I think many people think these books will be similar to Harry because they come up under the \\"If you like Harry Potter, may we suggest...\\"  This is where the similarities stop.  This is it's very own work that should be recognized for a great and original series.<br />1st off, you do not have to be a kid to enjoy these books.  I am 32 and love them.  Last night I bought book 1 & 2 in Artemis Fowl and devoured them in 4 hours.  Tonight I am going in to purchase the new one, book 3.  These are wonderful and well written.  I enjoyed them as much as I did Harry, but this world was different.<br />It is the earth world with an almost billionaire 12 year old super genious Artemis.  His father lost enough money to make them lose their billionaire status, and he wants it back.  Along with his faithful bodyguard, Butler, they are an unstopable team.<br />Artemis decides that he is going to make the fairies (leprecauns) part with their gold.  He comes up with an ingenious plan.  Enter, Holly Short with the LEPrecaun recon team.  She is the first and only female officer, and is out to prove herself.  In doing so, she does not recharge her majic, and after a near miss battling a troll, goes under direct order to recharge.  This is where Artemis catches and abducts her.<br />After this it is a great battle of wits between Cmndr. Root, Holly's boss, and Artemis.  Luckily Cmndr. Root has the help of an irritating Cenotaur aptly named Foaly (my favorite character).<br />You will smile and laugh out loud at the dastardly goings on, and the scenes that the Dwarf Diggums is in, well, he steal the scene every time and will make you laugh out loud.<br />This is a strong cast of character, and they quickly grow on you.  You find yourselves unable to root for either the fairies or Artemis, because you like them both.<br />If you enjoy a little bit of a skewed reality, you will enjoy these books.  I was not disapointed.  Happy reading!! P.S. you can always tell the really good books, because they never show up in the used book store, and if they do, they are gone as soon as they hit the shelves.  I would definately pay full purchase price for this series.  Don't buy just one, then you will have to anxiously await the next time you can nip over to the book store., because they never show up in the used book store, and if they do, they are gone as soon as they hit the shelves.

In a few I was crying I was laughing so hard!  It was hard to finish, I did not want it to end.  I relly felt the book shold be at least 300 pages longer, (must be too used my Harry Potters).<br />Tons of Morelli and Ranger like in the old books, none of this one or the other thing.  They take turns guarding her because as usual she has some freak chasing her.<br />I got lots of laughs from Lulu, and Connie goes on a trip to Vegas with Lulu & Steph.  Ranger and Joe take turns being her bodyguard, and now instead of blowing up Rangers cars, she is injuring the bodyguards he puts on her.  Typical Steph!!<br />This book is worth the hard back price.  This book also seems to stand on it's own, I do not think you need the background to read this.  It is funny no matter what!  Buy it now!!	2003-07-16

Claire was real and beleivable, as was the tension between her and Ian.  That got me through David's, (Claire's Husband)funeral.  You knew she found true love already.<br />I loved it when Claire broke into Ian's room and followed him to New York, I did think that they had chemistry and I liked the story immensley.  BJ, winds two stories together, the story of Claire and Ian in the here and now and there search for WW11 serial killer, and while everytime you think you know who it is, you are proven wrong, because whomever the killer is, is part of Claire's life now.  I had thought of this person and dismissed them, due to the fact I did not feel there was enough to point to them. BJ definately wends her way through to show you how this person was the killer, and she does it through the whole book.  They do have 2 sections dedicated to the historical WW11 aspect, where they show Ian's ancestors, Rachel and Eddy \\"Hawk\\" Marshall.  I loved Eddy!!!!  Rachel was great to, I would have loved to have more to their story, but it was short because they were both murdered.  BJ does a nice job winding this in, and laying out her facts.<br />The reason I only gave this 3-3/4 stars is because of the very last part.  I agree w/one of the previous readers, it was a little hard to beleive that Ian would take Claire on, but I just figured that if she was following him anyway, he thought he could manage her better by being with him.  Also in the last segment, when Claire is having to deal w/the fact that the serial killer known as Elgin is possibly her father, I thought she was TOO angry and distrustful of Ian.  I did not see what Ian had done to make her so distrustful, and thought she was being an immature idiot.  She lost my sympathy in the last 2 chapters or so.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed it, I thought BJ did a great job of giving us a complete history and would definately read more of these.  They are a little more on the Iris Johanson side than the romance side.  The story is about the murderer and the catching of, the romances are the side story to keep everything from being too dry.<br />I would not hesitate to buy this book, but if you are just a straight romance fan, you might not care for it.  This book is much darker than that.n side than the romance side.

It was o.k, but not really memorable.<br />I had a hard time identifying with the characters, and did not find them to be particularly endearing.  There were parts that were better than others, but overall I would skip this book.<br />If you need something, anything to read and it is just lying there, I would read it, but it is not a book I would make a special trip to the store to get.

I can see that happening, and I understand that it would be hard to get a job with a baby to support and no H.S. degree, but what I am trying to figure out, is how all of these people found out that Lacey had never been married.  I personally don't know anyone these days that thinks (if they do, they keep it to theirselves) much about a child born with out a father.  It is almost common, and I had a hard time beleiving that Robin (Lacey's daughter)never had friends because she was a &quot;love&quot; child.<br />Other than that, I really liked it, and would definately try another book of this authors.	2003-07-01

I only took 2 hours off to sleep.  After I write this, I will go back an re-read it, all 870 pages of it.<br />I went into this book with such trepidation, (by now everyone knows that someone important dies, I won't ruin the surprise.)  This book was a lot darker than the previous ones, in part because we know going into it that something bad will happen and we are waiting for it; unlike in 4, where Cedric dying was a sprung on us at the end, w/no build up to it. There were several potential death scenes preceding the actual one, and you wanted to race through it to find out what actually happens. This is why I am going back to re-read the book.<br />As always, it was very well written.  Harry has a lot of anger issues in this book, as he should, and Hermione manages to be the most emotionally mature one in the book, and really does a good job of smoothing over some of the rough spots.  Ron finally has good things happen to him.<br />This book was great, but it did not leave me feeling happy and excited to read the next one, instead I find myself feeling bad for Harry and what is coming in the future.  He has some great losses to overcome, and he finds out things about his family that he will have to deal with too.  Snape may actually have more of a reason to hate Harry than any of us have ever guessed, (although it is wrong for an adult to take out frustrations on a boy, you get insight into why it is so hard for him.)<br />Fred & George are superb, they come up w/great hi jinks as usual.  The Quidditch scenes are not very good, (I really miss Wood)<br />JK does a great job with a new character from the ministry dept., Umbridge is hilarious in her sheer pompous stupidity!!<br />It is great seeing her get what she really wants by becoming the \\"High Inquisitor\\" of Hogwarts.  Dumbledore is gone, and chaos reins.  McG, does a great job of putting her down!<br />Longbottom finally comes into his own, and finds the courage that we have continually seen glimpses of!!  He really impressed me in the way he came through for Harry and himself, I can not wait to see more of him in the future.<br />Overall, this book was fantastic; however, I would never start the series with this book.  As stated previously, it is the darkest of the series, I would start out w/one and work your way up, or you will miss some of the magic that makes Harry so special.<br />I eagerly await book 6, and hope with all my heart that things will get better for Harry, but fear they will get worse first.  Also, I think that that as we are introduced to the possiblity of Harry being an Auror, that we should continue these books into his schooling from the Ministry and his later adventures!<br />DON'T WAIT FOR PAPERBACK!!!

This is good and entertaining, but it is total mind candy.  It goes fast, and you forget it equally quickly.  I read this last night, and I already had to review it a bit to remember the plot line.<br />Charity is bored w/her life, and decides to move to the Yukon to prospect for Gold for 6 mos.  She thinks this will give her what she feels she has been missing before she finds the guy to settle down with and have a family.  She wants a grand adventure 1st.  There is some talk of her 2 sisters looking for the same thing, so we may see their stories in the future.<br />When she goes to the Yukon, she conveniently bought a plot of land right next to a brooding tall gorgeous guy w/attitude (sound familiar?).  Anyway this guy doesn't want her there, but wants her, and also convient, happens to be a retired billionaire.  (I really could have handled a millionaire)  Of course you can not tell it by the way he lives, he is obviously comfortable, but not to that extent.  He is also way moody, (what billionaire isn't)  and goes back and forth with the way he feels about Charity.<br />She is not a wimp, and after finding out that he had sex w/someone before he had her, she makes him sweat it out for 2 weeks, before he get back in her \\"good graces\\".  Can we say who cares if he got a hummer from someone before they were?<br />Anyway, it is o.k. KM tries to liven the plot w/a neat little twist of this guy who is trying to kill them, so there are a lot of accidents.  Hoky, but a good read.  I have not read this much of a romance in awhile, and it was a nice change of pace, but I could not read too many in a row.  Overall, this book is a good time filler, and well written.	2003-06-17

The story follows the story of Nan (read Nanny) and her quest to find a PART time position. (Did I stress Part time)  By happenstance she finds Mrs. X, and her delightful son Grayer, soon to be nicknamed Grover.<br />This story follows her through a year in the life of this incredibly dysfunctional family.  You will laugh and want to cry at the way the Grayer is used as an accessory by his family, but well loved by Nan.  She really goes above and beyond trying to make up for the love he is missing from his family.<br />My favorite part in the book is when she has to dress up as a tele tubby, can you imagine how hot that would be?  Then throw back a couple of drinks to get through a childs Halloween party, it was great.<br />It is hard to imagine that people live like this, but very insightful.  After being in customer relations, I can really relate to what Nan had to go through with the selfish Mrs. X!<br />Her relationship with her family and friends is wonderful, as well as the on the fringes romance w/Harvard. Her mother really does try and help her find a backbone with her employers, and you can really picture it.  This book is well written and very beleivable, it made it to my &quot;keeper&quot; shelf.<br />I recommend this book for anyone looking for something to pass the time enjoyably.  If you employee a Nanny, maybe you should read this to see it from another perspective.	2003-06-12

I really liked it overall.<br />The dynamic between the 2 protaganists is good.  I found the scenes where John is dealing with his families death to be very real.  I had a hard time beleiving that in New Orleans they would be buried below ground and not entombed, but other than that it was beleivable, and that is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  There are very few places in the state where you can have a below ground grave, and I had just done several cemetary tours.<br />I also really liked the way they dealt w/the fact that Holly had been a prostitute. KS did not make it seem like it did not matter at all, and the way it was handled was great.<br />The murderer was obvious after they 1st interaction w/him.  It was practically spelled out and delivered to you in the 1st 15 pages.  This had some steamy love scenes, and I would consider it to be a romance and not a \\"mystery\\" or \\"romantic suspense\\".<br />I felt that it could have been longer and gone into more depth w/Patrick the nephew of John. He was set up by KS as a possible suspect and given a ton of mental and emotional problems that I did not feel were dealt with.<br />I would say overall it was a good book, and would read other books of hers, but it was not great. If you like this type of book, I would read Erica Spindler (alot more depth) and Helen Myers (also has things conveniently happen, but good reads)	2003-06-07

I did not find it to be super scary, but you could definately see how it would apply to real life.<br />I had a hard time understanding all of the people into \\"cyber\\" sex.  I was surprised by the amount of it.  I guess I am not that computer literate, I don't even know how to find these sites.  It was a pretty different reality.  I also had the impression that this book was written several years ago.<br />Had 2 different story lines going on, and what you thought was happening wasn't. It was not quite that predictable.<br />Good way to pass the time.  I would recommend buying it used unless you are in love w/the author.  If you like this book, you would also like books by Kay Hooper, Helen Myers and Erica Spindler.  Also Lisa Jackson and Iris Johanson.<br />Good luck!	2003-05-19

This one is on my keeper shelf.<br />I love the fact that she makes him grovel, and that when he does something wrong that she calls him on it.<br />The killer was pretty obvious, it had an o.k. storyline.  I loved the chemistry between the main 2.  Definately a romance, if you like this book, I highly recommend Obsessed and Shadow Dance.  They were great.  Also, you would probably like Helen Myers and Lisa Jackson books.  Also Erica Spindler is really good.  And always, Nora Roberts and Mariah Stewart!<br />If you want more mystery and less romance, I would try Robin Burcell, and Iris Johanson.	2003-05-19

If you are new to Nora, you might as well jump in with this one.<br />Callie Dunbrook reminds me of Eve Dallas after she has evolved, and I love her.  I normally can not stand stories where the protaganists are divorced, and I hate archeology stories.  They are usually so technical, that I am not interested.  Not so with this one.  Nora as always made the book fast paced and entertaining.  There was not the awkardness you would expect with the divorce.  She handled that beautifully and from the beginning you knew, that they were not ready before, and were know, and that it would work.<br />Jake was wonderful, and Nora did a beautiful job balancing the \\"stolen baby\\" issue, so that you felt compassion for both sets of parents.<br />There is also a side story with her new found brother, and her attorney.  It is great too!<br />I won't go into lots of plot detail, many other reveiwers already have as well as the book description.  I just highly recommend this book.<br />If you like this, you will love anything by Nora, and I just found another author that writes in a style like Nora.  Try Mariah Stewart.  She does great stories about families and emotions with the romance/suspense storylines.	2003-05-07

She lost me for sure on Soft Focus, but redeemed herself with the Elipse Bay series.  It just seems like lately her hardbacks are not quite worth the price of admission.<br />Fear not, this one is.  Zoe and Ethan are very well written characters.  Zoe has some limited unusual psychic gifts.  Namely, she can feel if a violent act was commited in a room when she walks in it.<br />After entering a room of clients, (she does feng shui design)  she knows without a doubt that her client killed his previous wife.  She goes out and hires Ethan, a PI that just moved to town, and while she does not care for him, she can afford him.  So the romance begins.<br />Ethan manages to bail her out of all of her lifes scrapes and does so with interesting side characters.<br />As usual Zoe is a pasta loving, tofu eating type that JAK prefers.  Not my 1st choice, but I usually like their personalities.  Ethan is sexy and decisive.<br />If you are not a huge JAK fan, wait for paperback or used store.  But overall, I found that this one was a vast improvement over some of her other efforts.  It did not feel so run of the mill.	2003-05-07

I had eagerly anticiptated this book, and had that 1/2 feeling of dread that it would not live up to the other books in the series.  Thank goodness my fears were unfounded, if anything, I think this book surpasses the previous 2.  I managed to read this in 2 hours, now I want to go back and read it again!<br />We are only in Bon Temps for a short time, Sam has a brief spot and so does her brother.  Most of it is set in Jackson, Mississippi.  They introduce a new were-wolf.  I really liked him at 1st, but he did some pretty uncool things.  Perfect, because I want Sookie and Eric to hook up.  (Actually I don't want them to hook up so much, as I want the great tension to keep going between them.)<br />Lots of Eric!!  Bill only comes in for about 4-5 chapters.  I hope Sookie keeps to her guns and dumps him.  As ususual it had some hilarious laugh out loud moments.  It is starting to remind me of earlier Anita Blakes.  (Sookie gets her 1st vampire kill!)<br />I don't want to ruin it for you, but don't wait buy it now!!!!	2003-05-06

I thought it was just like the last one, only Anita was willing to sleep with more guys.  I know many fans that have followed this series feel that there is a little too much gratuitous sex.  I was one of them.<br />I started by re-reading all of the books starting with Guilty Pleasures and working my way up chronologically.  I did this in 4 days, and let me tell you the character progression is there when you do it this way.  Once Anita started sleeping with JC, this was a natural, it just gets lost when you have not currently read them all sequentially.<br />The biggest problem I have is the lost characters that I loved.  Edgar, Manny, the cast of animators.  This book at least brought Dolph back in, but it has really been awhile since we had this much Zerboski and Dolph.<br />What I have come to realize is that LKH has given such wonderful secondary characters that we have come to love an rely on, that is it hard to accept new characters because they take up plot development time, and it seems to take away from the characters we are used to.  The books are becoming very \\"character heavy\\", but it is an ongoing series.<br />I would recomend this book, but not as a starter, I would only read this series in order, or you will lose alot of it, and think that Anita is pretty trampy.<br />If you like erotica, you will like this book by itself as well as Narcissus in Chains.  Keep in mind that it is otherworldly erotica.<br />I am very glad for the development that will keep Asher in the series as a primary character.  Richard needs to grow up or go, I am sick of his histrionics.  Go Jason!!! Loved what he said to Anita.<br />I am giving this 4 stars instead of the 2-3 I originally planned because I did find the reason behind Anita's sleeping around, and it did seem to make sense.  Again I highly recommend reading all of the books from start to finish if you were disapointed with this one.  Good luck.<br />If you are looking for a great vampire series, i would suggest Charlain Harris \\"Dead\\" series.  They are wonderful.  Kind of Stephanie Plum meets Anita.re series, i would suggest Charlain Harris \\"Dead\\" series.  They are wonderful.  Kind of Stephanie Plum meets Anita.	2003-05-05

I had been recommended this book several times and ignored it because I read a funky review at one time.  It was wrong!<br />This book is great!  It lays a good solid foundation and starts a new vampire series.  If you liked Tanya Huff's 'Blood\\" series and early Anita Blakes' you will really like this one.<br />Sookie is a waitress in a bar with the ability to see what people are thinking.  She has always had this ability and has learned how to block it.  Due to this she has never had a relationship, I wont tell you why, but it is pretty humorous.  Then one night Bill, a vampire walks into the bar she works at.  She discovers that she can not read a single thought.  A  big attraction in itself.<br />They end up in a relationship and he assists her with his skills as they try to find out who is killing waitresses.  This is very well done.  She is a beleivable heroine who stands up for herself and also still manage to be feminine with out being helpless.<br />I really enjoyed it.  I would recommend buying Living Dead in Dallas with it as well, because you will not be able to wait for the second one.  Also book 3 comes out in May '03.  Get to it before you fall behind!	2003-03-11

I had picked this up at the used book store a couple months ago, and it went to the bottom of the pile.  Well, when I ran out of stuff to read I grabbed this.<br />The back with the divorce and everything kind of put me off.  This book is really fun and worthwhile.  I think that it should appeal to almost everyone.<br />A selfish socialite gets into a car accident and an elderly man from a nearby nursing home saves her from iminent death, and after meeting the guy, you knew it had to be from up above.  While trapped in the car, she begs God to do better in her life and to do good things.<br />The car changes her from a selfish social butterfly to someone who looks more practically at the world, and how she can help.  It was a very feel good story, and had some humorous moments.  It walked her realistically through a divorce whose time had come to dealing with and finding a balance with her 19 year old teenager.  It also found her discovering who she was as a person.<br />I think most women can relate to this book.  Definately get it!!	2003-03-11

I am glad that I got this book from the library.<br />I found it to be too convoluted, and could not find a character that I enjoyed enough to try and get through the rest of this book.  I am still not clear on the cross dresser double personality thing.<br />I love Jennifer Cruise, and have read all of her books, but I really like her earlier ones.  It seems like the last couple I have read just don't quite measure up to those.  She seems to be trying to top herself, and to my mind, getting so far out there that her books are no longer quite so enjoyable.  I generally consider this genre to be &quot;lighter&quot; reading.  Something to enjoy while I relax after work.<br />In this book I could not even keep track of the characters.  I just could not get into it.  If you are a fan of Welcom to Temptation, Tell Me Lies, and Crazy for You, I do not think that you will enjoy this book.	2003-03-11

After reading the reviews I bought this and the 1st in the series.  Great fun Reading, and I think I am in love with Eric!<br />Sookie is a 25 year old blonde bombshell waitress, with the ability to read peoples minds.  Her boyfriend Bill (whom she hooks up with in the 1st novel, this is 2) is a vampire, and he works for Eric a head vampire.<br />Eric decides to lend Sookie's abilities out to a Vampire in Dallas.  Sookie typically gets in trouble while the vamps are asleep and we get to meet some new characters.  More shape shifters in this book.  Sookie comes through, and then heads home to help solve a co-workers death.<br />I can not do this series justice.  If it does not seem interesting enough, buy it anyway, they are great. If you like early Laurell K. Hamilton, and Tanya Huff's Blood Price books, you will love this.  Very fresh and different.  The 3rd book will be out in May of '03.

It starts out where the heroines father was accused of a crime of stealing money from their small town bank.  Because of this you find out that she was ostracized and her mother could not handle the stress, and kills herself.  She end up moving out of state w/her mothers best friend, and being bitter her whole life.<br />Surprise, Surprise, years later they discover her fathers body, he may not have been guilty, and she returns w/a mega chip on her shoulder and a real bad attitude.  Enter Tony &quot;Silk&quot;, who used to mow her lawn.  He was from wrong side of tracks and is now very, very rich and successful.  He feel bad about not standing up for her when he was a teenager and the town was being cruel, etc. etc.  Now he wants to help her.<br />She is resentful and treats him badly, very cold towards him.  He perseveres, and continues to try to win her.  I did not feel they had any chemistry, but maybe I am wrong.  Then they have the subplot of discovering who was really behind the bank robbery all those years ago.  I did not find the person responsible to be a very plausible killer.  Also I never got the opinion that the killer was physically fit enough to manage some of these feats, but I was definately skimming to get through it.<br />I would try this book, but if you are looking for something great to read, I would try Susan Anderson's, Shadow Dance or On Thin Ice.  Also anything by Erica Spindler, or Helen Myers.  They are a little more on the unknown side, and they have good mystery/romance.  Hope this helps!	2003-03-03

In this one Byron does much of the adapting.  I don't know if it is because Byron is an artist instead of a hunter, but he is much more easy going.  He does not come across as quite as possessive as any of the others. (I personally really like Lucien and Gregor the best.)<br />Toni is a very strong woman and she does not take any guff from anyone, and it seems that Byron does not give her as much.  He gives choices and does not demand her doing as he bid or gives quite so many \\"mental pushes\\".<br />Great interaction w/his sisters adopted son that we read briefly about in the first one.  I found this to be fascinating as a background and how things are tied together.  It also brings in a new bloodline of carpathians.  We also visit w/Jacqes and Shea.  I found this to be very enjoyable.  It is not my favorite, but it is very good!!!	2003-03-03

This is a follow up to Cooper Blackstones' story, but you do not have to read that first.  This will stand alone.<br />I find this writer to be very enjoyable, and always buy her books as soon as they come out.  I prefer her darker books, such as On Thin Ice, and Shadow Dance, to her \\"cute\\" romances.<br />This one had a bit of suspense.  Lily is renting a room w/her friend Glynnis who is poor at money management.  Glynnis has run off with a guy Lily approves of to meet his family because they are engaged.  Meanwhile marine master seargeant big brother of Glynnis comes home to discover Lily their.  He immediatley beleives that she is taking advantage of his sister.<br />Lily finds a note telling her to tell Zach (the brother) where Glynnis has gone, she does, but does not trust him to not try and ruin the engagement.  She blackmails him into taking her with him up to Washington.<br />Sexual tension sizzles between them, and it is great to see Zach get all of his preconceived ideas about Lily thrown in his face.  They are witty and good together.<br />When they arrive in Washington they find out that Glynnis and her fiancee have been kidnapped.  Also an enemy of Zach's is following with revenge on his mind from a military mission gone wrong.<br />Very entertaining and flows well.  It was not so riveting that I had to finish in one night, but was very good.  I would pay the new price for this book.	2003-03-03

The dynamics between the characters has evolved and I really found alot of the pleasure I received from this to be the development more so than the storyline, althoug that was great too!!!<br />Roarke and Sumerset's parental relationship really show in this one, and we find out a deep dark secret about Summerset that I never expected, and to beat all, it is one he shares with Eve!!<br />Eve finally reciprocates, albeit a little reluctantly for everything Roarke has done in the past for her.  She becomes the one to take care of him and help him w/his family.<br />Almost no Whitney. No Tibble, a surprise sad meeting with Crack.  Mainly an Eve, Roarke & Summerset.<br />Great new character is added, he's a cranky ugly male version of Eve.  Have to read it!!! If have not started this series, and don't want to miss the nuances of the  characters, start from the beginning, or you will not appreciate them as much!!!  Definately a keeper!!

Very cute and fairly different setting, in the music world.<br />The side characters just got to be too much for me.  I did not feel as if they focused enough on Kylie and David, Ms. Brandt was trying to get side stories going, and that part just did not work for me.  She kept introducing different characters, and a couple you could never see the purpose of brining in to the story line, but overall very enjoyable.<br />Kylie is an adorable doofus, and David is a tight, I can't love anyone, because of my awful childhood type.  Kylie loosens him up.  Fun read, especially if you skim the extra parts, (you will see what I mean).  Maybe get this one at the used store though.	2003-02-17

This story follows &quot;1st Comes Love&quot;, and it is really cute.<br />We 1st met Bram as the tortured guy who visited his wifes grave daily (still does).  Honor, who followed Dylan to Hot Springs in the last book, her father blackmails Bram into marrying her.<br />Bram is a technical genius, who has a very modern household, all which is run from his palm pilot.  Honor does not get along with electronics, and proceeds to put everything on the fritz.<br />It starts off pretty typical, but is well written and enjoyable.  Bram softens towards Honor, but still has a hard time opening his heart because he is afraid of losing her the way he did his 1st wife.<br />There is a side story with Mia, (Bram's housekeeper) and Josh McCool, (Honor's Fathers assistant, who originally shows up to romance Honor but falls for Mia).  I could have cared less about that part and kind of skipped it.<br />It was great seeing Bram grow into a caring person and start opening up, and how they help each other heal, her from her previous kidnapping.  If you liked the 1st one definately buy it.  This story will stand alone if you don't want to get the 1st one.  Fun story that I read in one sitting, but not one of my keepers.	2003-02-17

The first one has Hester and Mitch, (boy was she having a Jayne Ann Krentz moment when she named her or what?).  With the exception of the name this was a really fun read.  Mitch is a comic writer, and she is bank loan officer with a 10 year old son.  He meets them when she moves into his apartment building.  He soon realizes that she is the one and spends the rest of the morning overcoming her fears of abandonment and commitment issues.  (She had a bad 1st marriage.)<br />In the second book with Ariel and Booth, he is the one that had a bad 1st marriage.  Kind of a theme, but both are fun and entertaining light reading.  I though that the 2nd one spent a little too much time on the acting scenes(Ariel is an actress)<br />She starts off as a soap star that wants to a part Booth wrote that was autobiographal of his life with his ex-wife.  I thought that they spent too much time on the soap story and they got busy with a child custody hearing, and there was a frankly bad spot where the ex-wife tries to \\"get\\" Ariel for playing a part she felt should have been hers, it got a little too busy, but all in all it was still worth it.  Nora Roberts getting distracted is still better than most writers at their best.<br />This is on my keeper shelf!!!!	2003-01-08

It started out really well, and I thought quite credibly.  Out of this world things were happening, and Josie was in the proper denial.<br />I mean when you are surfing and hit your head, and then see a funny little man in a kilt, you have to wonder if you need to go to a hospital, and she actualy thought this way instead of immediatly buying into the story.<br />I found it to  be enjoyable, but once she got to Scotland, I had a little trouble with all of the ghost parts.

I would have loved the stories 8 years ago, but have been spoiled by the much more enlightened men that we have been getting in our romantic suspense.<br />The males in these 3 stories are the type that are dark, brooding, and you have to prove your worthiness before they will trust you, and even then they will screw up and be majorly unforgiveable jerks, which us poor women should just get over.<br />The women characters at least are not trajic virgins, they are self supporting stand on their own.  I thought that this was great to read to see how much better Nora is now, but independently I think they are mediocre.  I think my expectations for her are huge, I read everything she writes as soon as it is put out and have all of her books autographed.<br />I took this book into my used book store if that tells you anything.<br />If you are new to Nora and like short romances I would start with perhaps the Mckade series, or Stanislaskis.  If you like strong kick butt women with gorgeous take charge men, go for her In Death series, or my personal favorite - Private Scandals.  Great works.!!	2003-01-07

This one does not.<br />The characters were just as rich and well defined as always.  Seth comes back home all grown up, and while the story definately focuses on him and his dealings with the very icky Gloria and the way she has used his feelings for the rest of the Quinn's against him, it also gives a good romance, and my favorite part, we get very updated with the rest of the Quinns.  Mostly Cam and Anna, (which was my favorte couple).<br />As you get to know their children, I can see more stories in the future with a new generation of Quinns.<br />Nora did a great job of filling in what has happened since we left off with them when Seth was 13 or so.  We touch base with everyone, and see what a great guy he has turned into.<br />Also, while the ghost of Ray used to visit the boys as they fell in love, this time we get to meet their mom \\"Stella\\".  She is wonderful.<br />Can't say enough good things. If you liked the Sea Swept series, buy this right away.  If you love the continuing series you should check out J.D.

Typical Lori Foster, has big sex scenes and is definatley erotica rather than romance, but this book seems to have mutual character respect, which I felt the previous one lacked.<br />If you were hangin in the towel w/the first one, I would try this one.	2002-10-22

I fell in love w/ him in the previous book.<br />He is so wonderful, while fighting for his humanity he still has honor, and Chloe is perfect for him.  I loved how curious she was about everything, and how she took things in stride.<br />I am not usually crazy about virgin stories, but KMM makes the beleivable and enjoyable.  If you like this story check out Sherilyn Kenyons Dark Hunter series.  I was very supprised @ some of the parallels the two had.<br />Both stories mentioned Buffy series, and had similar ways of explaining darkness, and both women liked to read the same romance novels.<br />Enjoy it, it is a keeper!	2002-10-22

I was very pleased w/the character development in this book.  The dialogue was snappy, and memorable.  You can see lots of future books based on the characters in this one.<br />If you like Karen Marie Moning, you will love these books.  I much prefered this one over the 1st in the series.  The female protaganist is wonderful.  She does not take any of the male macho stuff, and has great lines.<br />I really liked the relationship that the guys (other dark hunters) had, and can not wait to read the future stories.	2002-10-22

She has depression issues and real problems from a beleivable cause.  Many writers don't have something truly bad happen to a character, because it makes people uncomfortable. I for one was glad to see a real person.<br />I think this was very well written, and a good read for those of you who like mysteries.  This is not a romance, and if you like a healthy dose of romance in your series, I would try, Helen Myers, Nora Roberts or Erica Spindler.  Very good book!	2002-10-22

Eve is gaining a sense of family that is great to see.  Her character is really growing!<br />No real fights w/Roarke in this one.  Mainly it is interpersonal developments with Peabody & McNab, Feeney & Eve, Eve & Mavis.<br />Also we got Jamie Lindstrom.  I think that we have everyone in this book.  Alot more character development in this one with Trueheart, and (gasp) Mrs. Whitney and Eve get along again.<br />If stuff like this keeps happening, I think that Eve and Roarke will be having children soon!!!<br />Definately a keeper!

I did not like the characters, they sounded great on the back of the book, but, I sure thought they fizzled in real life.<br />It sounds kind of racy, but they really don't have sex 'til later in the book, and I just can not get excited about to what my way of thinking of is a gigalo or male prostitute.  In the future they have the sex super bowl where teams of guys bring women to orgasm, pretty much whoever does the most the fastest wins.  Just did not appeal to me.<br />I did not find it amusing, but it did pass the time, not pleasurably, but I did not have anything else to read.  I would pass on this book altogether, unless you are really curious, but don't buy new.	2002-06-24

I did not mind putting it down.  It is o.k, and that is about all I can say.<br />4 days later the characters are already fading from my mind.  I think this book is a time filler.  I liked My Bodyguard by Michelle Jerot better than this one, if you like the protective guy stories, I would try that or Linda Howards McKenzie series,& Diamond Bay.<br />The underwear model is upset by nude pictures posted on the internet by her ex.  She has overcome her bulimia and is kindnapped/comandeereed by a government agent that is \\"not a spy\\".  Has a couple funny things happen, but like I said, I can not get past o.k. on it.

I found it to be a fun and entertaining read.<br />This book did not make it to my keeper collection, but I will read other books from this author.  I hate it when authors guess about something because it sounds good.  For instance, when the heroine asks to see her bodyguards gun.  He hands it to her and checks the safety and then warns her after taking the clip out that there is still a round in the chamber.  2 Major problems, no one trained in guns ever hands over a weapon w/ammunition in it, espcecially a round chambered, and 2 Glocks do not have safetys.  The only safety is that the trigger has to be pulled.<br />After reading that it was harder for me to by his professionalism, and this is where it lost me a bit.<br />Very original and refreshing storyline.  Good way to pass the time.  I would recommend reading it.	2002-05-07

Then we move forward, C.J. is 26 and a police officer who daily tests herself to prove that she is no longer afraid of what happened when she was 10.<br />There are some great surprise twists.  C.J. is a likeable heroine, very resourceful.  She manages to battle her past, and a serial killer w/panache.<br />The serial killer also has some different and imaginative traps and plots as well.

This book is o.k. if you would like to pass the time between authors you love, but do not buy this and expect to love it.<br />I liked the interaction with his daughter the best.<br />I read in another review that they thought this book had chemistry, I personally did not see it.  The characters and author TOLD me there was chemistry between them, but somehow I missed it.  I guess it is a good thing the author kept reminding me that they had it. Another thing, I did not find Eli particularly charming, he did not seem to care much about Liza or anything that affected her.  It was vaguely reminscent of early romances where the woman was just so grateful for the guys attention that she put up with alot of crud.<br />I found several technical mistakes, right off the bat Eli thinks to himself that he is upset that his friend misrepresented Liza as dowdy.  His friend was to find a dance instructor for his daughter who just lost the mother, her custodial parent in a car wreck.  The friend has researched Liza.  In the next chapter, or maybe paragraph he is mentioning how he felt attracted to her from the moment he saw her dance 3 weeks ago.  Which is it?  This was in the 2nd chapter, so it started to lose me right away.<br />The book was very repetitive.  It was not a bad book, but I was glad I picked this up in the used book store on 10% off day.  If you would like a fun romance to read, try &quot;Catch of the Day&quot; by Janet Evanick.  That was cute, or one of Nina Bangs, hers are usually pretty amusing.	2002-04-29

I have been reading LH for years and have eagerly awaited all of her books.  My favorites and recommended readings are: All the Queens Men, Against the Rules, Midnight Rainbow,Heartbreaker, Duncans Bride, Loving Evangeline & The Mackenzies' series except, Chances story and Mackenzies pleasure.  All of these to me were 6 stars, and I have kept and re-read thse often.<br />Now on to why I gave this 3 stars.  First of all, there were one or two phrases that popped up several times in the book.  I would literally have to re-read the section because I could not believe that she used the same turn of phrase that closely together.<br />Then there was the hot and cold between the couple.  He was embittered and \\"hated\\" women, she was the woman who could overcome it,(sound trite and well used to you?).  1st off, the detective/mystery portion of the story were not well thought out.  He said she had receipts w/dated times as the alibi to the 1st murder, but he never followed up and went to those places and asked if anyone had seen her? HELLO!!!<br />Then after the 2nd murder, they did not even test her for powder burns, and I am sorry, but to have the man that supposedly wants to marry me believe that I could commit this murder, again, what is wrong w/this picture.  Seem to me every time she needed support he was gone.<br />Then there was the sicko, it was like when you got to the part where he captured her LH was told she was running late for her deadline and to hurry it up.  You will see what I mean.<br />If you are not familiar w/Linda Howard, you will love this book, or if you do not look to hard at technical details, if you are a previous fan that likes her unique style, you wont find it in this one.  This would be a wonderful 1st effort for a new author, but I feel it falls a little short of the mark for LH.	2002-04-22

It was perfect, we did not have to wait for the trilogies, we got all of them at once.<br />If you are used to Nora Roberts, you know that their are often a trio of friends/siblings that you follow, in this wonderful story you get them all at once. It is nice to have the brothers/sister all involved so closely on the same time line.<br />The backstory is the Lusitania is sunk while a thief is stealing one of the \\"Three Fates\\" small silver statues depicting the greek fates.  His life is changed when the ship sinks and he lives.  He reforms himself, this is the story of his great grand children.<br />2 Brothers and 1 Sister go after the fates and in doing so find the love of their lives.  It is nice having such varying characters in such depth.  I loved the dynamics between the 3 women, their strenghts/weaknesses really complement each other and you watch them become stronger because of the bond that they made.  I have 2 girlfriends that give me this type of strenght and it was nice to see it written about and captured so well in this book.<br />Not just a great romance, but a wonderful testament to friendships found in unlikely places, which tend to be the most enduring!!!(not to mention hot men and great chemistry)  Don't wait, this book is worth full hardcover price!!!!	2002-04-11

This book was very enjoyable and a maybe on the keeper list.<br />Once I started I had to finish and I will keep this because I am going to be purchasing others in the series; however, I do not know if they will always stay on my shelf.<br />I really enjoyed getting to know more about the greek gods and see how this author pictured them.  I think she definately captured the arogance of them.<br />If you like your romances w/a little improbability and otherworldliness, get this one, it is very good.<br />I thought that the way she got Julian was a little trite and well used, but it picked up after that and became it's own story.  See other reviews for info on the book.  Highly enjoyable!!	2002-04-11

I do not know if her writing has changed or I am outgrowing her characters, but I do not feel that this lived up to LKH.  This is the last hardback I purchase of hers.  I loved the 1st in the series, but this one was a real let down.  I really feel she gets Anita(see Anita Blake series) confused w/Merry.<br />She seems to be rushing thru these books and not giving them the previous depth that the others had.  I did not feel that her characters were as well developed as previous novel and it lost my interest about 1/2 way thru.  Forced myself to finish, and like I said, will no longer eagerly await her books, or purchase hard backs.<br />From now on I am a paperback used book store girl for LKH until she goes back to better development.  I would recomend 1st book in series and Anita Blake series 1-6, lost me on those after that.	2002-04-11

Who would ever buy a hardcover after reading this?!!!<br />There was no proof reading.  I don't know how many discrepencies I caught in the story, I lost count after the first 3 chapters, but I am thoroughly sick and tired of &quot;how observant&quot;, &quot;his eyes did not miss a thing&quot; coming up 3 times in a paragraph.  O.k already, Mark is the most incredibly observant person to have ever been born, and he does not miss a thing.  That said describe something else.  And to my knowledge silver has always been classified as a gray color, so telling me he has silver gray eyes is redunant.  Another thing, if Josette never wears make-up, how can she go up to the hotel room to refresh it?<br />I am 1/2 way through the book, and this is all I can tell you about it, besides for all the commenting on Marks incredible observations, he apparantly has no clue who the murder is.  (you know for sure as soon as you meet her.)<br />Don't waste your time.  For all the remorse Mark feels about accusing Josie of being a liar, he never really quits being much of a jerk, but we are supposed to feel sorry for him, because he has never gotten over her.  Who loves a guy who thinks she is lying about being raped?!  Sorry, but this one is hard not to rant about.	2001-08-10

It was well written, and I personally just did not care for the story line.<br />I think that I fell so in love with the Knight of a Trillion Stars, Rejar and Mine to Take, that this just did not work for me.  I personally could never live in a world like this, so I had trouble enjoying the story.<br />The men in this book are treated pretty much the way many women are treated in Regency Romances (which I don't care for either.)  In this case however, I just had trouble seeing the man as a strong partner, and I can not stand a week man.<br />This might not be everyone, like I said, it is well written, and this is personal preference, but should you find yourself agreeing with any of this, you should wait for paperback.	2001-08-09

It was one that sounded good, but I had other better ones to read.  Then I read Lost, by Helen Myers!  --One word KEEPER! After I read that I tore my house apart looking for the bag that had this book. I love her character development, they are very natural.  If you like Erica Spindler, Kay Hooper, and wish Iris Johanson had more romance here you go.  Helen Myers.  I am now in search of many more of her books. The one thing I have found that always works w/the story but does not happen in real life is the convenient death factor.  The people that definately die are always the ones you think to yourself, &quot;The protaganists life would be so much better if ______ would just die&quot;  but I guess that is why it is fiction.  Too bad life is not that neat! Don't wait, buy this one!!	2001-08-08

I just wish it were longer, but it will have to do until Seduction in Death next month. Eve and Roarke were great, snappy dialogue.  Brief appearances by the others, but for once it is Roarke who dreams of the past instead of just Eve.  Excellent!!!! The Laurell K. Hamilton was not it's own story, which is why I did not give this 5 stars. I was disapointed that it was the beginning of 'Narcissus in Chains'.  It sure starts w/a bang, but you might be lost if you have not read any of the Anita Blake series.  It is one of her more hard core works, (you will understand after you read.)  I was really disapointed, and felt tricked because they gave this story a different name than the book.  I guess we just have to wait until October to find out what happens. Susal Krinards was great as always, not only did she give us a very different type of story from her normal works(this deals w/people w/esp) they also gave us a preview at the end for her 'Wolf' series in October.

I was so excited when I found this book, I had just been telling somenone that I wish I knew when Dalden's story was going to come out.  Now I wish that it still had not. Brittany is great on earth, but is a major wimp in Daldens world.  She refuses to believe that she is not on some major sound stage.  Get real!  There is no sizzling passion between Dalen and Brittany, I am not sure why he wanted her. If you want great stories read the 1st 2.  I loved Tedra and Shallens stories, they were literally out of this world. This one has more dynamic between Tedra's computer Martha and Brittany than Dalden and Brittany.

Everyone should read this book, and not lose sight of what happened in the concentration camps.  This is a great story of hope.  Not only did Mr. Spanjard get away, but he has selflessly shared his story no matter how painful to thousands if not millions of Jr. High Schoolers to share a painful subject in a story they will find interesting. Mr. Spanjard, if you read this, I will always have a place in my heart for you, and want to tell you how deeply I appreciated your coming to my school.  I have not, and will never forget.

I just finished Book 3 and am eagerly awaitining 4.  I am 30 years old, and this is one of my new favorite series.  I  decided to try this to see what the hubub was about.  Now I know!<br />I can  see why people young and old alike love these fabulous stories.  They are a  fun journey into the world of wizards, witches and mystical creatures that  teach a lesson on wrong vs. right similar to a fable.  Harry Potter is  someone everyone can identify with, and secretly long to be.  I beleive  that this will appeal to everyone.  I love all of the characters, and love  having clearly defined bad guys to loathe!  I beleive my favorite in this  book was Professor Lupin, I sincerely hope we have not seen the last of  him.<br />Quidditch is my new favorite sport!  It is an excellent game, and  you will find yourself rooting along with Lee the not so impartial  announcer.  Who wouldn't love a sport played on flying brooms?<br />The books  are so good that I ordered all of them in Hardback for my set of keepers.  Trust me when #5 comes out I will be on of the people standing in line @  midnight to get it.  You do not have to read these books in order, but I  would recomend doing it.  So far I have found that each book surpasses my  expectations.  I do not beleive that these stories will disapoint you.	2000-09-18

I feel that this is the best one since  Naked and Glory in Death. This book has brought back some tension between  Eve and Roarke that makes you eager to turn the page, and when you are  finished with it, you want to go back and savor it again.  I already have  about 20 scenes that I love to re-read.  This one gave me goosebumps and  tingles!  The mother/daughter dynamic between Mira and Eve is developing  well.  Eve has really evolved.  I really enjoy Chief Tibble and he is in  here as well.  This one has everyone but Truehart who I am sure is still  recovering from his injury in the last book.  Charles is referred to.  We  got more Mavis, an awesome run in with Sumerset, and more of Webster from  IAB. In this story the focus is very firmly on Eve and Roarke. When reading  the preview I was not too excited, but because this is the best series out  there bought it anyway.  Boy was I glad I did.  I can not say enough great  things about this book. Great Villain!  It is a nice change of pace to know  who to hate from beginning to end, there is no guessing who the jerk is,  just how Eve is going to build a case against him. If you are new to the  series, I would start @ the beginning with Naked and Glory.  Don't get just  one or you will hate having to wait for the 2nd one, and buy them new, you  either won't find them in the used book store, or you will wear them out  from re-readings.  Nora Roberts does a great job tying everything in so you  understand it, but it is better when you feel you know the characters so  you understand all the subtelties. Enjoy it!  I know I did!	2000-09-13

This was a great read that will keep you guessing as to who the murder is,  almost a first for me.  Normally in the romantic suspense you can guess the  murderer in the first chapter.  In this one, I had a suspicion, but was  thrown off and doubted my real guess.  I had to finish it to appease my  curiosity.  I love a book you can not put down. I was really excited to  learn that FBI Agent Noah Bishop, who is very enigmatic and sexy will be  appearing in 2 more books in the coming months.  It will be great to find  out more about him without having to wait. This is definately more a  mystery than a romance.  For those of you who love Kay Hooper, you will not  find the personal chemistry between the characters of some of her other  books, but you will get a great suspense book.	2000-09-06

Normally I would be re-reading a Dara Joy book for about the 10th  time.  ...I will confess that High Energy is about the  least likely book that I would want a sequel to.  I am having a hard time  reading this book, it is a little too out there for me, and I don't find  the relationship that humorous.  What I do like is the referals to Rejar  and Yaniff and wondering how they are going to eventually tie in to this.  If you liked High Energy, this will probably do it for you.  High Energy  was the book she wrote that I thought was O.K., but was not my favorite.  The other thing I dislike about this book is the way she refers to Tyber as  Doc, or The Captain, or her Husband.  Pick one or 2 and stick to them, but  I practically have to reread the paragraph to figure out who they are  talking about. Dara Joy seems to be very intimate with this couple and I  feel like there is some inside conversation going on that I know nothing  about, but would find hilarious if I did. Well I will continue to persevere and hope that this  gets better, or I understand it more.	2000-08-18
US	51070673	RONAUR0Q5RT5	0671034065	142020743	Mr. Perfect	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Wait for Paperback	As a die hard Linda Howard fan, I could not wait for this book.  It did  not quite live up to expectations.  If this was another author I would have  loved it, but it did not quite make it worth buying the hardback.  I have  already traded it in to the used book store.  I did not feel that we  really ever got to know the characters.  It all happened way too fast and  was entirely to predictable.  You have the murderer picked out in the first  chapter.  You can even guess the order that they are going to die in. It is  a good read, but I would wait for a library copy.  It is not one of her  keepers.  There were some funny scenes, but I think after reading other  reviews that I expected them to be more.	2000-08-10

I think she more than proved herself, and do  not understand why she was not treated more as a partner, and less like a  pawn.  He has nothing on his brothers.  This was a fairly big disapointment  for as long as I have been waiting for his story.  The best parts of the  story were when Chance was visiting Zane.  I would love to have more of the  kids stories, we have to have Nicks!	2000-08-10
US	51070673	R229MCDMCOLL3Y	0886777844	787755626	Summon the Keeper (Keeper's Chronicles)	Books	3	0	5	N	Y	Somewhat Slow	This book was a good time filler when there was nothing else to do.  I thought after reading the reviews that I would love this book, but found that I had a hard time getting into it.  I did not find the cat all that  witty, the ghost was irritating and Claire, the main character in charge of  closing the pit to hell in the basement was not very likeable.  I did not  feel that the characters had much depth.<br />The sister Diana was the most  interesting and lovable character in the book, unfortunately, it was not  Diana's story.<br />The attempt to weave romance in was not very good.  I was  surprised to find out the characters finally had a night together since I  felt that their was no chemistry.<br />It is good it you want to read  something with a different storyline, but don't look for endearing  characters or great chemistry.<br />It is a good book when their is nothing  else to do, but I would not stop what I was doing to read it.	2000-05-27

I have been reading Diana Palmer for the past 18 years, and I have to say that this is the worst book that I have ever read by her.  Maybe I am just getting too old for her typical storyline of slightly emotionally scarred virgin.  What girl in this day and age gets that put off by a grope in a  truck by the man she has been chasing for 2 years. How many virgins can  there be and why do all the great rough and tough men live in Jacobsville?  Puhleeze! I was partially disapointed because I expected J.D. and Gaby to  be in this and that was one of my favorites.  If you are looking for them,  don't, they are vaguely referenced in one line.  Goodluck getting through  this, I persevered hoping that it would get better.  Do yourself a favor,  if you have to read this because you love the author, wait for the used  book store, I am sure they will be over run with copies from other  disapointed reader.	2000-05-24
