Some of the literature is also advanced enough for children of middle school age.  The only drawback is that there is not enough of a selection of authors or literature.  The copyright date is 1991, and I feel this is a book that should be done every couple of years.	2000-10-16

The author made a point of explaining to the reader that if you show someone kindness and caring (even though they may not be kind or caring), it may turn that person's feelings around.  This is a wonderful story that has several themes, and should be shared with children.	2000-09-22

The author has shared her humor, creativity and I  suspect her experiences.   This picture book is also considered a  predictable book, because there is one verse that is repeated.

The author has also used word choice and  vocabulary in a way that should inspire children to extend their creativity  to include their knowledge and experiences with the facts they are learning  in their educational level.

The author also demonstrates the connection  with a reading strategy known as text to world.  Using this strategy she  shows that there are similarities from other cultures of the world to our  own.  I recommend that this book be used as an excellent example to  demonstrate how children throughout the world help their parents and find  that growing up is part of a continuing learning experience.  The book  explains to children that as they grow up and learn, they will find not  only joy and gratification in helping their parents and siblings, but they  will also become aware that they do not need to give up their childhood  pleasures and experiences.  The book gives the reader the feeling that each  person will find the time to enjoy things from the past, present, and  future. It is a book that might be shared between parent and child, or in a  classroom setting.  It is a wonderful example of multicultural reading.  I  would also highly recommend this book to be used to model as well as be a  starting point for discussion of the reading strategy: text to world.  It  is often difficult to find books that help teachers teach both  multicultural experiences and strategies, this book is an example of both.	2000-08-21
