This edition collects the mini-series of the same name. Jenny Sparks who guided the Authority has her life and the lives of the Authority examined in detail. A lot of blanks are filled with some left open. <br /> <br />Jenny is the spirit of the twentieth century and we see her life in various stages. She suffers from the \\"Forrest Gump Syndrome\\" she is one of those figures who interacts and acts upon the famous and infamous and shaped the twentieth century. <br /> <br />Out of all the stories I found the story of the Doctor and the Engineer the most interesting (which is not to say the others are bad just amongst a field of gems I am choosing the best). <br /> <br />Well worth the read while we wait for DC to reboot the Authority again.	2005-08-14
US	51920266	R3TC93D4YPNT2X	0441011616	812276406	Camouflage	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Action Movie Time	Joe Haldeman is one of those authors that always entertains, but the question is: Does he satisfy? In this case I say yes. <br /> <br />Camouflage is about two shape shifting aliens. One preferring to be male the other female that have been on earth for thousands of years. One is evil the other is good. They are united in the common goal of an artifact found in the water that might unlock the secret of one, or both. Also we must deal with the people caught in the crossfire of two very powerful beings. <br /> <br />It has all the Haldeman touches, exotic locals, a near future and some gritty scenes. <br /> <br />Using aliens to comment on the human condition is one of the oldest plots out there (but lets face it there are no new ones) the trick is the spin and presentation each writer gives and Haldeman gives a good one. <br /> <br />The ending was touching and funny. Oddly enough I could see this as a James Cameron movie. <br /> <br />The book is well worth the read.	2005-08-14

The first deals with Reed and Namor fighting over Sue and ends with a tragedy that brings humanity to the entire cast. <br /> <br />The second story is about a dying Psycho Man and the terror he brings to New York. The story is tense with a dark Twilight Zone feel to it and a clever solution that nobody will see coming. <br /> <br />Its not just the big plots that make this collection work it is all the little touches (Reeds powers are used in ways nobody else thought to during the F.F.s 40 year run). <br /> <br />Needless to say the art is top notch with one of the sexiest renditions of Sue ever seen on a comic page. <br /> <br />I say buy it, read it and then pick up the other volumes in this reprint series and pity those who had to wait to read these one month at a time.	2005-07-24

Again	The Fantastic Four used to proclaim themselves \\"The World's Greatest Comic Mag(azine)\\" Well under Byrne's helm it could rightfully be said so. <br /> <br />The trick of revitatalizing a franchise is to know what to take, what to emulate, what to improve upon and what to leave behind. Byrne is going full steam ahead. <br /> <br />Byrne builds on the characters without forgetting their roots. He touches on the great FF epics while telling new stories. It looks like a combo of Stan and Jack with a litle Larry Niven style science fiction thrown in. <br /> <br />The book starts out with a trip into the Negative Zone. Along the way they encounter many a science fiction twist while all the time trouble is brewing in the Baxter Building that brings in no less than the Avengers (another series Byrne worked on). <br /> <br />This book includes the famous \\"widescreen\\" version that had to be read sideways (but alas the free tattoo inserts are not reprinted). <br /> <br />With Annihilus and Galactus as villians and a case that leads right back to the second fantastic four adventure way back in F.F. #2 how could you go wrong??	2005-03-06

And with all this he took on the Black Panther. <br /> <br />But what to do with a character that only had one short run on his own before. Kirby could have used it as a soap box for various issues of the time but instead he decided to run with it and have all out fun, whether it was fighting a group of treasure seekers or  fighting aliens this is Jack at his best. I even liked it better than this run on Captain America of the time (which I liked a lot) but this was better. Out of touch with the rest of the Marvel Universe the Panther could run loose and wild. <br /> <br />Fantastic stuff. <br /> <br />The reprints are from Black Panther #1 to 7, so this leaves room for a volume two which see some of his relatives get into the Black Panther act (almost a Black Panther Corps. going on). <br /> <br />My only wonder is if they will continue onto the last issue or so of the series that did not have Kirby art, but rest assured this volume is the Jack Kirby show.	2005-03-01

With their patriotic duty done and the television on its way the comic heros faced a decline. But before All Star Comics dumped its heros for western fare their came one shining light, the last glint of the golden age reprinted in All Star Archives #7 (worth it just for the Solomon Grundy dust up alone). <br /> <br />Volume 8 is not lacking in excitement. Here we have a scaled down Justice Society without the benefit of mystic counsel (no Spectre, Dr. Fate) or even the Sandman for that matter.  <br /> <br />In number #34 they square off against the Wizard (a mystic foe who even today while under used still haunts the DC Universe). <br /> <br />In #35 the JSA fights one of their most stubborn foes Per Dagaton (who is currently feature in today's current JSA storyline) as he tries to undo progress by tampering with time itself. I'd just like to know what parents would name their kid Per Degaton?? <br /> <br />#36 is a case so big that two of DC's biggest guns Superman and Batman have to lend a hand. This storyline spilled over to the 80's early in the run of Infintity Inc. which told the stories of the sons and daughters of the JSA before the dreaded Crisis and recon took over. <br /> <br />#37 has the villians team up to form an Injustice Society of their own (Holy Legion of Doom Batman). This story was reprinted in one of those 100 page DC Comics that I picked up as a kid and still love today. Der Degaton, the Wizard, the Thinker, Vandal Savage. How could this not miss. <br /> <br />#38 has the JSA facing off against some of histories greatest villians, but the real importance of this story is the start of the redemption of the Black Canary who at that time was considered a villian (though one with a heart of gold). This would set her up to join the JSA later on in the series, just in time to see its decline and eventual resurection in the 1960's, <br /> <br />Let's face it for all their crudeness there was a certain charm and vitality to these stories that you just don't see today and just can't read today 'cause the price of the originals would wreck your mortgage (and marriage). <br /> <br />A worthy collection for anyone's collection.	2005-02-21

This second collection of stories (the first being Bizarro Comics) again turns DCs icons over to some of today's best alternate cartoonists and is a very enjoyable romp through the DC Universe. Take underground comics, your favoite DC comics, old Mad Magazines and your favorite strips from your local alternate newspaper, blend and this is what you get. <br /> <br />The framing sequence with Bizarro was more enjoyable to me than in the first one and seemed to blend in better with the rest of the volume. <br /> <br />The book seemed a little heavy on Batman stories, but don't worry there are a broad range of characters that get the \\"Bizarro treatment\\". The tales ranged from homage, to parody, to satire to dope dreams to slice of life pieces that would almost (heavy on that word) be welcome in a regular DC comic or annual. <br /> <br />Particular standouts were: <br /> <br />Tony Millionaire taking on Batman again in a story that  evokes a 1930's Batman feel. <br /> <br />A Legion of Super-Heroes tale where a corporation driven Brainiac Five drives the Legion to rebellion. The story and art makes you think Kurt Swan and Shooter could have drawn and written this on some crazy rainy night. <br /> <br />Evan Dorkins and John Krewson turn Kamandi into a slacker who'd rather veg out than help talking tigers, and lions and apes (oh my!). <br /> <br />This volume was fun. The hits far outweighed the misses. If you did not like one story don't worry the next one will be along soon.  <br /> <br />Well worth it.	2005-02-12

This is the sixth volume in the DC Archives series of Plastic Man reprints from Police Comics and Plastic Man. Covering Plastic Man #5 & 6 and the Plastic Man stories from Police Comics #s 59 to 65. The madness continues but there is a question of credit where it is due. <br /> <br />At this time in his career Jack Cole was busy. By all accounts he was an artist who liked to do it all from drawing to inking to lettering but at this point in his career he had to turn his creation over to other hands (just like Will Eisner turned his beloved creation the Spirit into Cole's hands while Eisner went into the army during World War II). <br /> <br />The trouble is that in the golden age of comics many times records were not kept of who did what (not until Marvel where the creators were promoted were their credit boxes in every story and even then people still debate who inked Fantastic Four #1 in 1961).  When you view the content pages very few of the stories have credits for the reason I sited. <br /> <br />None the less the army of creators Cole employed to do the job were more than up to the task. From battling babies to femme fatales. From evil magicians to Woozy's (Plastic Man's W.C.Fields like sidekick) the pace moves fast, furious and whacky with the occasion bit of pathos thrown in. Some of the stories almost seem like motion picture cartoons magically captured on paper.  <br /> <br />The best thing about the reprints in this volume is other than some of the fashions they stand the test of time and do not seem dated today which is one of the tests of great fiction or art. <br /> <br />Well worth it.	2005-02-12

This is part of the same series that brought us the reprint heavy Origins of Marvel Comics, Son of Origins of Marvel Comics and Bring on the Bad Guys. <br /> <br />The book is heavy with reprints. Stan Lee provides buffer pieces between reprints. He did this in the other books in the series but here they have shrunk to one page or so. I really don't think people  read the things and looking back now I wonder if they are as objective as they could have been in regard to who created what. <br /> <br /> <br />Now I enjoyed the reprints, though these are the stories only without the covers. But some of the choices of stories had me scratching my head, until I realized that unlike other volumes in the series the \\"O\\" word (Origins) was not in the title.  <br /> <br />The format allowed stories to be presented that were not origins (though there are some in there) such as the first time Sue (Invisible Girl) Storm uses her force field. <br /> <br />Over all, this is the Marvel equivalant of the DC 100 page Super Spectacular Comics a big book of fun reprints (and judging by the used prices its cheaper than some of them). <br /> <br />So if you like your women super powered this is the book for you. If you are trying to do some serious research regarding the behind the scenes stuff that went into the creation of these characters you might have to look elsewhere.	2005-01-25

Dillin would draw the League through the end of the sixties and into the seventies. <br /> <br />But before Mike Sekowsky left he did leave some gems in this volume. Of particular intrest is issue #61's story, \\"Operation Jail the Justice League.\\" In which heroes and villians swap identities. Something that would be touched upon three decades later in Identity Crisis (the comic limited series). <br /> <br />In issue #69 Wonder Woman shows up depowered and leaves the League (due to events in her own title drawn and edited by former League artist Mike Sekowsky) but its okay because the woman who will replace her Black Canary (plus future JLA member Red Tornado) make appearances in the Justice League/Society crossover in issue #64. <br /> <br />Also of note is the Creeper's guest appearance (ala Metamorpho's early appearance) in Justice League #70. <br /> <br />We begin to see the shift from cosmic classic hero epics to social issues something that becomes more and more the League's stock in trade as they try to become relevant in the 70's. <br /> <br />This is a good volume filled with many milestones as silver age begins to draw to a close. <br /> <br />As for the quality of the book itself, this is part of the DC Archive series so everything from paper to binding is top draw.	2005-01-24

This is the first volume which dwells more on the New Gods saga.     The second volume  in this series (Jack Kirby's Fourth World Featuring Mister Miracle) takes the series in a different direction as Kirby's Fourth World books (Forever People and New Gods) were cancelled. Mister Miracle found himself in more conventional superhero stories that had less and less to do with the Fourth World.    For the cheaper price you pay you get the art in black and white with grey tones added. The results resembles those old Warren Magazines of the 70's and Kirby's own flirtation into magazines (DC's Days of The Mob).    The story  follows young Scott Free as he escapes Granny's  orphanage on bleak Apokolips and goes to earth. He assumes the identity of Mister Miracle, escape artist and finds a cast of supporting characters. Similarities between this story and David Copperfield by Charles Dickens abound and are even eluded to by Kirby in the most important story in this book \\"Himon.\\"    \\"Himon\\" deals with a man who goes around the planet Apokolips helping people think for themselves and overcome the brainwashing of the dictator Darkseid. This includes young Scott Free and his future wife Barda, Simon gathers a group of young charges aound him and eventually becomes a martyr for his cause (several times!!!).    The other story of note is the reprint of issue #6 which introduces \\"Funky Flashman\\" a very thinly veiled Stan Lee. At the time the story was produced Kirby had just parted ways with Marvel and with Stan Lee (his collaborator) and had felt slighted  by him both financially and in creative credit. This was his way of getting it out of his system and it is one of the most biting parodies in comics. Even Roy Thomas catches a bit of the flack in this one.    Vince Colletta inks the earlier stories and is slick in his own way but I personally favor Mike Royer who pencils and letters the stories after Vince left as hisstrong solid lines really compliment Kirby's pencils and over all general dynamic style.    This is Kirby (as the phrase goes) unleashed and in in his prime.    Well worth it for the price.	2005-01-22

Mister Miracle is Jack Kirby's super-escape artist character. <br /> <br />The first volume was tied more tightly with his \\"Fourth World Series\\" (New Gods, Mister Miracle, Forever People and to a much lesser degree his run on Jimmy Olsen). <br /> <br />By the time most of the stories for this second volume came out the  other Fourth World titles were cancelled or on the verge of being so. The Demon and Kamandi were in the works. <br /> <br />Mister Miracle was being aimed at more conventional super hero fare (or at least as conventional as Kirby could make it). This is not to say the stories are bad, just different from the earlier part of the run.  <br /> <br />Of note is the introduction of Shiloh Norman who would become Mister Miracle's apprentice and latter in the comics assume the role of Mister Miracle (as he may do again this year, 2005, in a Grant Morrison Maxi Series). <br /> <br />Mike Royer provides the inking for the stories in this volume and his stong line compliments Kirby's pencils rather well. <br /> <br />Why only four stars, its the black and white. These books were meant for color, but then again the price can't be beat. <br /> <br />But don't worry too much, the last story in the volume is the wedding of Scott (Mister Miracle) Free and Barda and the entire cast of the New Gods shows up to make it a wedding slug fest in the grand tradition of Kirby's Fantastic Four Wedding. The very last panels are like something out of Shakesphere and are well worth reading and rereading.	2005-01-22

They all survive and dedicate themselves to challenging the unkown, in the belief that they are now living on barrowed time.<br /><br />EC and Marvel legend Wally Wood and oddly enough Kirby's wife Roz Kirby ink the tales in this volume to great effect. Wood refines and adds polish to Kirby's dynamic pencils.<br /><br />The stories are on par with what was being done in DC's Mystery and Science Fiction titles of the time with more of an adventure twist.<br /><br />Of note is the story \\"Menace of the Invincible Challenger\\" from Challengers of the Unkown #3. In the story one of the Challengers, Rocky, gains super powers from a space flight ala the Fantastic Four, but three years earlier.<br /><br />Kirby eventually had to leave DC due to a problem over a comic strip he was producing, going over to Atlas, which would shortly become Marvel (and the rest is history).<br /><br />Bear in mind that the Challengers of the Unkown primed both the pump for DC's and Marvel's silver age.<br /><br />A good volume of seldom or never reprinted silver age stories.	2005-01-22

They collaberated together and did feud over who did what. But they shared a bond whether they were together or apart.<br /><br />The comic book business eats his young and Kirby is potrayed as a tough but nice guy who cared more about others than they did for him and paid the price for it in the long run. Stan Lee on the other hand knew how to play the system and stay on top being the public face of Marvel while Jack toiled away.<br /><br />We see Kirby's early days, his DC days, his Marvel days, return to DC, return to Marvel and scattered last years as he fought to get his art back, all the while Stan was the golden boy who could do no wrong.<br /><br />The world of comic books is hardly the Office of the President. Most of the history is oral, the recollections of men and women from decades ago. Is this the truth? Will we every know the whole story? Probally not, but this book is a good and entertaining start.	2005-01-21

It is well worth hunting down. <br /> <br />Copywrited in 1977 the author, Robert Mayer, deconstructs the super hero mythos that in many ways paved the path for such books as Watchmen and Miracleman. Sometimes the book can be serious and at other times comes close to Kurtzman's Mad Magazine. <br /> <br />Superman, Batman and the Mavel Family are dead (the last killed by a lighting strike. A man named Brinkley (last survivor of the planet Cronk, parents Archie and Edith, told you there was some Madesque satire) was once the world's most powerful hero, now he wanders around, middle-aged, his dreams unfufilled, ala Moore's Miracleman.  <br /> <br />Civil unrest in the streets and a super-powered menace show up, gradually he gains back his god like powers, only to be forced to make a choice that may destroy him and his family. <br /> <br />Don't let the sometimes silly tone distract you from one of the great superhero novels.

Give him a cosmic epic, a crook story, a science fiction or a fantasy based world and he could do it without missing a beat. There was a sense of whimsy in his work that you do not see today. <br /> <br />The second story, \\"Metamporpho Says No!\\" has the freak of a thousand elements turning down the League. Man, when I read that story as a child I wondered who the heck he was to turn down the JLA, but now I could see why. <br /> <br />The Key, The Shaggy Man, The Royal Flush Gang all appear. It is a tribute to the series creators that these characters are still around today in one form or another. Of course there is the treat of another crossover with the JSA and the Spectre makes his appearance fighting things on a cosmic scale with the help of the Atom. <br /> <br /> It is worth the price alone to go to page 165 and watch the JSA belt Solomon Grundy with pies. You heard me right, pies! <br /> <br />Another gem in this line of archives. Sometimes the stories were silly, sometimes they didn't make as much sense as they should, but they were fun.	2005-01-17

This is the top of the run of Mike Sekowsky's art, here is the Justice League in all its glory. Starting in Volume 8 we see a changing of art and writing styles as the line up changes.

For my money few people could carry on the adventures of earth greatest heroes better than Mr. Dillin. He can do the quiet scenes, he can do the action scenes and he can keep all the costumes straight. For my money he draws one of the most beautiful renditions of Black Canary, bar none.<br /><br />This is a period of change for the Justice League of America. The innocence of the 1960's was giving way to the activism of the late 60's and early 70's. The writers of DC were trying to grapple with becoming socially relevant and were feeling Marvel Comics nipping at their heels.<br /><br /> Issues such as pollution and tolerance are starting to be shown. Wonder Woman had been de-powered and turned into a Mrs. Peal (of the Avengers) clone (ironically by former JLA artist Sekowsky). Who would will the estrogen gap? None other than the Black Canary making her way from earth 2 to earth 1 after suffering a major tragedy.<br /><br />Times were changing even further. The League shed its human mascot Carl Snapper as he was tricked into betraying them in issue #77 by the world's most average man.<br /><br />The biggest zinger to me oddly enough was this is the time that the price rose from 12 to 15 cents signaling the beginning of the end for the silver age of comics.<br /><br />While none of these stories are up there with the \\"big\\" epics of the past it still is an enjoyable stroll in which you will discover many under appreciated stories<br /><br />Read and enjoy.	2005-01-16

You will challenge yourself to find titles that are not listed. There is a broad range of titles, from golden age to the modern age. Undergrounds, mainstreams, eighties independent movement and implosion are all covered with equal loving care. <br /> <br />Are the reviewers opionated. Darn straight they are but that is what makes this book so much fun. It seems that they really read through all the stuff that they reviewed. Pity the one who had the long run on let's say Action Comics. Yow! My mind might be putty. <br /> <br />Great for helping you catch up on a title you used to follow.  <br /> <br />Obscure enough that you can buy it as a gift for the comic fan in your life and they most likely won't have it up on their bookshelf. <br /> <br />My verdict: There is nothing wrong with the 2nd Edition of this guide but if you can score the first cheap why the heck not?	2005-01-07

If you were like me the main features were great, but it was the back up stories that would really get me. From Phantom lady to Robot Man, you would get a glimpse into a time and a world of heros that were new and fresh to you. <br /> <br />The same is true for the book. Oh yes you get the \\"big guns\\" like Superman and Batman, and some of the mainstays, like Sandman (in his gas mask no less), but what of the really lesser know lights like the comedic \\"Red Tornado\\" and Mutt and Jeff (which really blew me away at some of the arts resemblence to what Robert Crumb would do later. <br /> <br /> <br />The book's huge size guarantees hours of reading, discovery and rereading. As for the art, some people said say the art of the golden age was crude. I like to think of it as raw and bursting with energy. And some of it will surprise you by it's grace and uniqueness. <br /> <br />As for the quality of the book, hey its a DC Archive so you know it is done up right. <br /> <br />As for the price, the sticker price is a bit steep, but Amazon with its free shipping and discount puts it into everyone's reach. <br /> <br />Liked DC's hit Starman, well look at the stuff that built the foundation of the DC Universe. <br /> <br />Coming soon will be the Seven Soldiers of Victory Golden Archives (January) and Comic Calvacade Archives (Bringing you never reprinted Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Flash stories with load of guest stars.  <br /> <br />I thank DC for preserving the golden age today.	2005-01-05

I have to give kudos to the Archie series of reprints.  <br /> <br />Little Archie is unlike the \\"little\\" versions of adult characters of today as the stories are fun and stand on their own. There is a kind of fairy tale logic that adults and children will find appealing. Archie encounters everything inculding aliens. The oddity of it all was that every now and then the art would elevate to a level of realism even more than was seen in the current Archie comics as a way of highlighting the flights of fancy that little Archie went on. <br /> <br />The thing I like most is that the tales don't talk down to children or dumb it down for the reader. <br /> <br />For the price (the cost of two magazines on a newstand) it is well worth adding to your collection. The sort of thing that your kids can pass to their kids one day.	2005-01-02

Just shut them up in their moldy room and leave them alone. <br /> <br />This book is lively exploring the history of World War II in small painless (if not fun) chugs. <br /> <br />The book is broken down into themes and explores the war from the battle front to the homefront. What did celebrities do during the big one? How were women and child affected. How was it like to go to boot camp? These questions are answered along with many more in a quirky and fun style. <br /> <br />Verdict: A great book to get someone into history without scaring them off.

And this is a shame as it is one of the keys to Larry Niven's wonderland known as Known Space. <br /> <br />The Pak race has a three stage life cycle. Childhood (self explanitory); breeder (adulthood) and with the Tree Of Life Root becomes the sexless (both in deed and form) ultra smart Protector. <br /> <br />Phssthpok is a childless (meaning he will die soon) Protector who has traveled from the galaxy's core to save a lost colony of Pak Breeder whose Protectors have died out. What is this lost colony? Well it is the third planet from a medium yellow star. Phssthpok sets into motion a set of events that will change all of Known Space. <br /> <br />You can read other novels of Known Space without ever reading Protector but reading it makes the expierence all the more richer. <br /> <br />Would you trade away some of your humanity to become faster, stronger, smarter and nearly immortal? This is one of the things you will ponder as you read this novel. <br /> <br />A very enjoyable read.	2004-12-11

But there just wasn't enough material to be satisfying. Even at the lower Amazon price I    <br />don't find it worth it except for the real bat-fantatics out there. <br /> <br />Another point with the DC DK guides that fustrates me to no end is that if they quote a story line in an entry somewhere in the book they should identify what issue it came from in case someone wants to read that story. <br /> <br />My verdict: A good buy from a remaineder bin otherwise turn off the Batsignal.	2004-12-04

The author, Mike Wright covers things in a breazy and fun way. Actually this book lead me to want to explore certain subjects in greater detail to which I owe it thanks. <br /> <br />My verdict: A good subway read for adults, great to give to younger people as a primer to the period covered in the book, the 1960's.

Perfect reading on the train or in the throne room (bathroom to the common folk). <br /> <br />My verdict: Buy this and some of the other Men's Health Life Improvement guides and give them out as stocking stuffers or as part of the holiday grab bags.

Many of the stories reprinted in this book I have not seen reprinted since. <br /> <br />There is also a nice secition on Underground Comics written during the time they were in full florish with no end in sight. <br /> <br />It is reflective of the the time it was written (the later 60's) and has a vitality you don't see in many of todays books on comics. <br /> <br />My verdict: Buy it and take home a living piece of history written at a time before, slabbing comics (heck they didn't even bag them much in those days),	2004-11-30

Not every single title is covered- i.e. the Archie Line of books (you would need a seperate book for this line alone but the key Archie titles are)- however other than that exception you will be hard pressed to find titles that are not mentioned. <br /> <br />I found myself leafing through the book from section to section as my nuerons fired and I wanted to check up on this and that. It was a great help for catching up with series that I had lost touch with.  <br /> <br />Modern Age - Golden Age and Silver (including the independent implosion of the late late 1980's) are covered. <br /> <br />Great reading and addicting.	2004-11-27

Thick, pretty to look at, even the spine is designed to make you think of the old big little books.However it reminds me more of a day by day calender project that got turned into a hard covered book at the last minute.    Inside the book there is a page of text for each day of the year. On the opposite of the text page is a blown up comic panel. Pretty to look at, and this is where the book fails. The reading is a bit too light and the focus is on the blown up comic panel rather than on some interesting trend of the time when the comic that surrounded the panel was published.    An attempt is made to be \\"arty\\" making the focus often these very oddball and (in my opinion) unexciting comic panels. I think most readers would have liked to see a book of golden age comic covers rather than this.    When I saw Les Daniels was attached I had high hopes for this book as I had bought his other books on comics. More text might have made this book more interesting.     My verdict. At the regular street price this book is not worth it. At the Amazon price it might be worth it. A nice stocking stuffer for somebody who is into comics but I found it to be more of a snack rather than a main meal.	2004-11-24

Let's face it....some Heinlein, even bad Heinlein is better than no Heinlein, but in this case it barely squeaks under the bar. <br /> <br />This story is set in a society of genetic supermen where honor is settle via duels. Brace yourself for long preachy chapters on genetics (which in fairness are pretty advanced when you consider this book was written in the forties). <br /> <br />One of the odd things you will find is the characters don't seem to relate to each other at all as if they are merely there to \\"pitch\\" for the boss (the writer). <br /> <br />Then there is the fact that the two main characters brultalize the women they wind up with in the end. One of them tries to laser zap her and latter when they get together he says \\"I tried to burn you.\\" to which she replies something to the effect of \\"I know you did not mean it.\\" Grrrrrrr! Slap them around and they will come back to you? Even in 1948 this might have been a bit much to ask anyone to accept. <br /> <br />There are some interesting nuggets here and there but they seem to have been thrown together with no master plan and in the end it is a most uneven ride that draws to the a conclusion that makes you scratch your head and go \\"Huh?\\".

It would tend to make adults not want to read it and that really is their loss as most of the juvenile books are every bit as good as his \\"adult\\" novels. <br /> <br />Tunnel in the Sky has variations of the themes covered in \\"Lord of the Flies\\". A group of youths are cut off from the world and must establish their own civilization. <br /> <br />\\"Rod\\" the survival trainee is one of Heinlein's most human protagonists in that he is not a superman but a regular guy that most readers can relate to. <br /> <br />The story  deals with both the growth of a new society and the growth of a boy to a man, and what it means to be one. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though there are some great science fiction concepts going on here.

It's a shame this stuff came out in Black and White when it deserved color. Do you hear me DC????? Color!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This collection is worth it anyway. When Kirby wrote and drew this series his teen years were decades past and yet he managed to convey what youth wanted at that time wanted which was to make sense of things and to be counted for something. The usual Kirby Kosmic Space Opera unfolds and seldom is topped today.<br />A Galactic Trip worth taking!!!!	2003-11-03

I pray when they get around to doing a book on the life of Kirby they do as well.<br />This was a fast and enjoyable read on the life of Stan &quot;The Man&quot; Lee. He comes off almost like Forrest Gump in the sense that he is in the middle of all the events that shaped the four color world of comics. Some of the connects were quite interesting.<br />Very fun to read and not a pander-piece.	2003-11-03

As King Kirby Would Say	Everything is in this one but the kitchen sink. Opps there it is and by Kirby too!!!<br />Seriously Kirby just cut loose in the early 1970's in this series. He took Jimmy Olsen and ran him straight into the fourth world (Darkseid? The DCU main man of menace? Debuted in these pages. How is that for an exclusive Clark and Lois!!!  Run and tell Perry about that!!!).<br />The bones of these stories have been feasted on for over 30 years by nearly everyone who has lifted a pen towards the New Gods. There is humor and wonder in these tales. When you read about the cloning and other inovations you will really believe these stories came from today's headlines.<br />A thought provoking trip!!!!	2003-11-03

It makes me miss the days when Mad would advertise  100s of paperbacks by the letter pages.<br />The stuff looks best in black and white. The humor still rings true today even though the subject parodied may not be.<br />Part of the fun is that you can look for days at the art and still find new things hidden within.	2003-11-02

The best part of the Supergirl archives is that it is strongly set in the Superman universe where the most outlandish things can happen with nary a bat of an eye. This is the tall tales and folklore of the 20th Century.<br />A fun read and a vacation from the all too self conscious comics of today.	2003-11-02

It is well worth hunting down.    Copywrited in 1977 the author, Robert Mayer, deconstructs the super hero mythos that in many ways paved the path for such books as Watchmen and Miracleman. Sometimes the book can be serious and at other times comes close to Kurtzman's Mad Magazine.    Superman, Batman and the Mavel Family are dead (the last killed by a lighting strike. A man named Brinkley (last survivor of the planet Cronk, parents Archie and Edith, told you there was some Madesque satire) was once the world's most powerful hero, now he wanders around, middle-aged, his dreams unfufilled, ala Moore's Miracleman.     Civil unrest in the streets and a super-powered menace show up, gradually he gains back his god like powers, only to be forced to make a choice that may destroy him and his family.    Don't let the sometimes silly tone distract you from one of the great superhero novels. As with all great stories you will find this to be equal parts tragedy and comedy.	2003-11-02

This is Jack Kirby at his best. Just before he made his switch to Marvel from DC he set loose on the world another Fantastic Four-the Challengers of the Unknown. Their adventures did not lack from their lack of super powers, if anything they were enhanced by it. Some of the stoires echoed Kirby's big monster stories for Marvel where ordinary men battled beings from beyond the norm. A great read with that DC silver age feel and yet that feeling of Marvel power. The next volume will have Wally Wood mixing in with Kirby and I can't wait for it!!!!	2003-11-02

The Doom Patrol was one of those odd books DC played with in the early 1960s. I know that everybody knows that Doom Patrol and X-Men hit the stands at nearly the same time but in retrospect the 1960s Doom Patrol was more fun to read than the X-Men (especially after Kirby left).<br />When you read the Doom Patrol you feel they took a slight fork in the road from the rest of the DC Universe of that time. Other DC heroes seldom crossed paths with the Doom Patrol and the oddball menaces they fought could only have been fought by them.<br />The art by Bruno Premiani (a really unsung hero of the Silver Age) gives the stories an air of realism that makes the fantastic elements in the stories all the more fantastic.<br />I wait impatiently for a second volume.	2003-11-02

The Spectre reminds me of Little Nemo in Slumberland. Anything can happen and often does in the Spectre.

History is the problem. Then it was watching the DCU change into a new form. Now nearly two decades later it is more of a relic than anything else.<br />However the George Perez art is still breath taking. While I don't love the story as a whole there are some wonderful bits to be read by Marv Wolfman that do entertain even today.	2003-11-02

I liked this book in the sense that it was a Mad sampler. I got to see art by old friends (I have been into Mad since the early 1970s) but I don't know if a novice researcher would find this book as good. There are short biographical sketches of all involved.<br />The best history of Mad was The Mad World Of Bill Gaines which is sadly out of print for decades now.<br />Also while I know that the title is Mad Art this book lacks for not talking of the writers of Mad.	2003-11-02

This included fake history pieces about this long lost Marvel character who should have been up there with the big guns like the F.F. and Avengers but then disappeared. <br /> <br />He wanders around similar to the way Mike Moran walked about in Miracleman-a god in human form, suffering like all us mortals but worse as he had a dim memory of the god-like power he had given up. <br /> <br />As the book progresses a storm starts to brew and we discover why the world was made to forget the Sentry ever was. <br /> <br />I found the story dragged at bit when I bought it on the newsstand but you know what??? When I read it in the collected edition it held together a lot better.  <br /> <br />This book is for everyone who had to give up a dream to do the right thing (raise a family, serve their nation, take care of a disabled love one) and will really strike a cord with them. For everyone else maybe it will show you how we feel.	2003-11-02

You have to hold this book sideways to read it so there you already look a bit Mad to begin with.<br />In the 1950s America was a very conservative place so when Mad hit the newsstands of anytown USA it was like the cultural equivelant of an A-bomb going off. Mad parodied anything that moved and was freshest and most vital in the beginning of its run.<br />The parodies remain a fresh today as they did then with hundreds of small sight gags that  will take more than one rereading to find.	2003-11-02

And you know what??? It disturbs me now even as it entertains me now which is a good thing.<br />It is a wake up call for the four color world.<br />The black and white printing only enhance the effect.

Agents - Archives, Volume 2 (Dc Archive Editions)	Books	5	18	19	N	N	Wally Wood Challenges Marvel	TOWER Comics is all but forgotten but for one brief shining moment they produced some great stories<br /><br />THUNDER Agents were part of the spy craze of the 1960's with a super heroe twist.<br /><br />Tired of the main stream and not quite into the underground Wally Wood with several of the biggest names in comics (Steve Ditko,Dan Adkins, Reed Crandall, Gil Kane and Mike Sekowsky) wrote and drew these stories. The Marvel Influence could be felt in these stories in the sense that the characters had their ups and downs, such as THUNDER Agent Lightning dying a bit every time he put on the suit that gave him super speed.<br /><br />Yet there was time for fun, DC, style stories like the last one in the volume where THUNDER Agent Weed is helped by Dynamo ala Superman into believing he has super powers.<br /><br />Another great story is \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\" where the android NOMAN struggles with his lack of humanity. He is a human itellegence trapped in an artificial body that can never feel love the way a human can.<br /><br />Well worth it for reading some silver age stories that are less well known (but equal in quality) as compared with the Marvel line of comics of that era.	2003-11-02

When I discovered THUNDER Agents I felt like I had fallen into some alternate reality where Marvel and DC combined to create this series. This series has the anything can happen feel of DC's Silver Age along with the pathos of the early Marvels.<br />The art is top notch and the stoires feel like they are moving in a unified direction. A fun step away from the all too familiar Marvel Universe of the 1960s.	2003-11-02

Lately there has been a trend to put all big stories in softcovers when they used to be in Annuals or Specials. I feel this one could have gone that route, but this is an economic comment, not a comment on the story or art.    The Hiketeia (according to the book as I am not a cultural expert on such is thing) is a pledge of fealty. A young girl who committed a crime in Gotham has come to Wonder Woman and taken the pledge. Trouble is, Batman wants to bring her to justice thus setting off a chain of events that can only lead to tragedy.    J.G. Jone's art is realistic and sets a good tone for the somber story.     Greg Rucka (the writer) keeps the spoken dialogue sparse which helps to move the story along.    Much of this story's chemistry has to do with the current Wonder Woman and Batman romantic attraction. Oddly the cover to this paperback edition has Wonder Woman's foot planted on Batman's head and the look on his face could be interpeted as either a grimace or a smile (this is also in the book on page 82 and 83). This harkens back to the early days of the Wonder Woman comic (1940s) when nearly every issue had her in some sort of bondage.    What made me wince a bit was the scene (minor spoiler) on page 84 where Batman tries to take the same oath that the young girl did and kisses the outside of Diana's thigh as he speaks the ritual. I don't know the scene was so not right.    All and all despite the bumps along the way I found this to be an enjoyable story though the ending is clear from the first page.	2003-11-02

Sometimes we must give up our fictional friends. Jake and his friends seem tired and need to rest. They have entertained us but now I feel like a guest at a party that has overstayed his welcome. Everbody is going through the motions but I just don't feel it.<br />One of the things I really didn't like is Jake and his crew's attitude of: &quot;We are so clever Nod-Nod Wink-Wink.&quot; Everybody has some sort of power incuding his kid. It seems they are running into the  same wall that Superman in the comics did. You make a character or a group of them so powerful you really have to strain to come up with a problem worthy of them.<br />In short this book seemed a bit to much by the numbers.<br />As much as I love the characters I hope this is the last I see of them. I will remember them fondly from prior books.	2000-10-30
