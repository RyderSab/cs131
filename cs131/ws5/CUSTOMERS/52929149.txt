(Even so, it's the only presentation to suggest that the `h' in `mihi' be pronounced like the `ch' in `loch', which is likely to have been true in many times and places.  Elsewhere in this book the more usual `miki' pronunciation is advocated.)  The phonetic pronunciation for the Mass is a little cumbersome, but accurate enough to serve until a more reliable pronunciation guide is found. <br /> <br />I lack the expertise to comment on the accuracy of any other chapter of the book, but it certainly presents a wealth of information, and the typesetting makes for an unusually beautiful book.  There's an excellent glossary and a fairly long list of recommendations for further reading.  So if the subject is of interest, I would unhesitatingly recommend this book to anyone. <br />	2005-01-31

Better would have been \\"Winsome Lists for Word Game Lovers\\".  It is not necessary to attain expert proficiency in order to enjoy word games more.  Sometimes just a little proficiency makes the difference between not enjoying and enjoying a word game.  The bulk of the book at the end is for reference.  The lists that will make a real difference to you are found towards the beginning:  Complete lists of short words with difficult-to-use letters such as Q and J; words with their hooks (single-letter additions that form words); words with many vowels; and much, much more.  These lists can help with crosswords, Boggle, or any word game, but the emphasis is on Scrabble.  There's even a cleverly constructed game in which a hypothetical player comes back from a deficit of more than 700 points. <br /> <br />There's not quite as much focus on the meanings of words as one might have hoped, but there is an interesting list of words such as CUTE which take unexpected plurals (CUTES is really the plural of CUTIS). <br /> <br />Some of the most interesting material is autobiographical in nature, and highlights how word games like Scrabble are not at all just for freaks.  The author's \\"unsolicited advice\\" is about the sagest I have ever seen, and can be modified to suit a wide variety of life situations.  Having known him off and on for over twenty years, I am sure he will not object if I leave it to you to buy his book to find out what this advice is.  <br />	2005-01-04

Less than a decade ago, a mystery writer relayed that her publisher had two taboos about the genre:  no kids get killed and no animals.  This one violates one of these.  I think you are apt to identify the culprit well before the authorities do, and there's a rather unsatisfying, over-the-top coda to the book before the arrest occurs.  But with the setting and many of the recurring characters so satisfyingly introduced, you will probably enjoy it.  I've read the next two entries in the series as well, and they are very much of the same character:  a little over-the-top, and especially in the third adventure, not quite enough sleuthing by the central character, a monk in an ecumenical Cape Cod abbey.  These books are somewhat better as novels than as mysteries.	2004-08-04

The result is that everything you need to know about England to understand what is going on is gently set out for you. Among other things, you pick up the British equivalent of &quot;library card&quot;. There's plenty of mystery, plenty of suspects, plenty of sleuthing, and at least the lead character is one you'll look forward to meeting again in a subsequent novel.	2004-08-04

The author (usually) omits it and gives no reason for her preference; unlike most who avoid the serial comma, she mentions a couple points in its favor. Ironically, she fails even to note that her later example &quot;Don't guess, use a timer or watch&quot; lacks the ambiguity she ascribes to it if written by an author who consistently uses serial commas. If you require solider reasons for insisting on its use, try an Internet search on &quot;parents God comma&quot;. <br />  <br /> This is rather a funny book, and we in the U.S. certainly needn't expect British humour to be exactly the same as ours. Still, it seems a bit odd to allude to abortions in a humorous context even in our so-called civilization. <br />  <br /> Indeed there is much to praise in this book. Most of the advice given is sound, particularly that on the use of what we Americans call quotation marks. It was a nice surprise to see double quotes used in a British context (and kudos to the American publisher for not dumbing down the opus by Americanizing it). The modern British preference for leaving punctuation outside quotation marks, when warranted, is catching on over here too, especially in technical use; this book provides a welcome introduction to it for non-technical Americans. <br />  <br /> The advice on forming possessives turned out to be sound but unnecessarily prolix, and the author omitted the key information on how a possessive such as Thomas' is pronounced by the organization that insists on that spelling. (And did you know there's no apostrophe in Harrods?) <br />  <br /> The author provides a lot of information new to me; still, I've run across a lot in other places that could have given some valuable weight to this slender volume, which you can enjoy in a single afternoon or evening. So, unless you're a student in a course for which it's recommended or required, my advice is to save money bywaiting for a future paperback or remaindered edition. This book is timeless; you needn't rush...	2004-07-30

Most enthusiastically recommended.<br />The author is an MIT graduate, a Jesuit brother, and an astronomer at the Vatican Observatory.  Only such a polymath could have written this intriguing book.<br />For one thing, it contains the clearest popularization of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle that I have ever seen.  At last I understand why those who say they understand it probably don't.<br />The science is presented, so far as possible, in terms that should be accessible to any likely reader.  For example, there's a particularly charming description of Brownian motion in terms of brownies in a playground.<br />The religion is presented quite concisely.  After all, the book is about how physics illuminates creation, and the bulk of the book has to present physics.  The author is entirely successful in showing that there is no conflict between true science and true religion.<br />There are a great many amusing anecdotes as well.  Since I have read more than a few popular science books, inevitably some were old friends, but many were completely new to me, such as the one about Planck's Constance.  Perhaps more important are the brief allusions to Father Grimaldi (who named the phenomenon of diffraction) and Bishop Oresme.<br />There are a few minor flaws, such as the brief discussion of the mathematician Goedel being, at best, woefully incomplete, which is too bad.  A full understanding of Goedel would be helpful to the author's theses.<br />In short, this book has my highest recommendation.	2004-02-28

Along with Adler's \\"How to Read a Book\\" (which is briefly summarized in Kreeft's book), it is the book I most wish I had been able to read when young enough to profit most fully from it.  But no one is too old for this book.<br />One of the most enjoyable features of this book is the way it skewers modern logic, sometimes allowing it to skewer itself.  Worth its price even for that alone.  The author does concede value to modern logic in its place.<br />This book shows both the practical and philosophic sides of logic (if there's a difference).<br />According to an old proverb, repetition is the mother of learning.  This book repeats all the key points so often that the reader could hardly avoid learning them.  An answer key provides the answers to the even-numbered exercises of most sets, facilitating self-study.  The exercises themselves range over a wide variety of ideas.<br />A minor matter:  Kreeft's version of Barbara Celarent is not couched in dactylic hexameter like the version presented in Sister Miriam Joseph's book \\"The Trivium\\".  The latter book covers not only logic but grammar and rhetoric as well, in a shorter space, hence is neither as clear nor as comprehensive a treatment of logic as Kreeft's book, but just as entertaining.  If you like a stereoscopic view of things consider her book alongside Kreeft's.<br />The publishers on the whole have succeeded in producing a handsome volume, but there are many annoying glitches, some of which could have been found with a spell checker.  Confusion may arise from the misspelling of \\"gaol\\" and of the Latin words \\"nomina\\" and \\"affirmo\\".  It appears to me (a former mathematician) that the author uses the term \\"zero-sum\\" in a non-idiomatic manner.  And surely, when the author recommends reading all of Plato's works up to the Republic, it wouldn't have taken much space to list them.<br />The most serious drawback is the absence of an adequate index.  Whether you use this book as a textbook or just for your own enjoyment, I recommend you make your own index as you go along.<br />The section \\"Logic and Theology\\" begins: \\"In principle, what could possibly be a more important application of logic than its application to the ulitmate question, the question about ultimate reality?\\"   Five sections later:  \\"Ethics is the most important part of philosophy.\\"  I leave it up to you to decide whether there's any contradiction here, or whether I'm just quoting out of context, equivocating, or committing one of the other fallacies in this book's long list.  But I predict you'll be profiting from this book long after you've forgotten the details of most of your college texts.	2003-12-31

There are also a few comments by those who don't like the print size or other technical aspects of this edition (and Ignatius Press would do well to consider those).<br />Most of you who read this are in fact looking for a suitable translation.  The RSV retains as much of the widely acknowledged majesty of the King James Version as recent manuscript discoveries and evaluations permit, also taking into account changes in the English language that make KJV in places incomprehensible or even inaccurate for today's readers.  This version does not succumb to the trendiness of the NRSV, which all too often obscures the meaning of the text.  The few changes that differentiate this version (RSV-CE) from RSV will be of particular interest to Catholics, and it is especially fine to see the Old Testament presented in the Septuagint order used by the first Greek-speaking Christians (i.e., the so-called deuterocanonical books, sometimes miscalled apocryphal, appear in their traditional places).	2003-11-29

Of the many things I could add, I will simply say that the book offers seven guidelines for the pronunciation of Church Latin:  two are wrong, one is at best misleading, one is too vague to evaluate, and one manages to combine all three of these problems; of course, that leaves two that are correct.  But you will probably want to spend your money on something with a higher batting average.  Wheelock's is better in essentially every way; if your particular interest is Church Latin, Collins's &quot;A Primer of Ecclesiastiacal Latin&quot; is an excellent choice.	2003-10-07

It is simply amazing how much knowledge the teacher could assume from her students and build on.  Fortunately, the current edition has been copiously footnoted for us.  These and other updatings occasionally give an anachronistic flavor to the material, but more often highlight its timelessness.<br />After introductory chapters on the liberal arts and on language, two chapters on grammar (which are not dull summaries of long-familiar rules - in the 1930s these could be taken as given) lead smoothly into several chapters on logic, ending with a fine chapter summarizing fallacies.  This material will be challenging, but a lot of fun, and for the most part presented with great clarity.  (I have to admit, however, that after repeated readings I still do not understand why John is a rabbit.)  Along the way you get to meet Barbara Celarent.  The book concludes with a sadly brief chapter on composition and reading (i.e., rhetoric) which I wish I had read many years ago.  An appendix gives a brief biography of the author, a nun who taught for many years at Saint Mary's College (South Bend).  A lecture by Mortimer Adler crystallized her interest in the trivium.<br />Highly recommended - a 6-star book if ever there was one.	2003-09-10

But it was positively sprightly compared to this book.<br />The authors take an historical approach.  If by \\"Simple\\" you expect \\"Introductory\\" then historical is not the right approach in any subject.  (You wouldn't, for example, plow through all of Euclid's Geometry before learning decimal digits.)  The result, for example, is that the second chapter deals with Politics.  While important, political questions are hardly the most gripping that philosophy has to offer.<br />Even as an introductory course in the history of philosophy, I can envisage a much better book than this one.  It does have fine bibliographies at the end of each chapter, and would form a decent review book.  There are a few amusing anecdotes, such as the one concerning a philosopher who testified about an auto accident.<br />The last couple of chapters are better than the earlier ones would lead you to expect.  The penultimate chapter deals mainly with deductive logic, and actually has exercises with answers.  (If you enjoy this material, you will probably enjoy the more leisurely and thorough coverage given in \\"The Trivium\\" by Sister Miriam Joseph.)  It also reviews fallacious reasoning.  If you're going to read this book, read this chapter first (the authors seldom let the dullness from one chapter darken any other discussion, so you can read the chapters in almost any order), and perhaps you will be sufficiently armed to spot the fallacies that led, for example, Hume to conclusions he himself regarded as absurd.  The final chapter deals with modern trends, which possibly interest the authors more than classical philosophy.<br />Philosophy can change your life.  This dry tome is unlikely to.  Never trust philosophers whose grasp of Latin permits them the misspelling \\"ad nauseum\\"!	2003-08-12

Entries now appear in a sans-serif font, basically an improvement, though the abbreviation for Illinois looks absurd.<br />The cover claims 10,000 new words and meanings, including long ball, peloton, rabbit-eared bandicoot (who would seek that under r rather than b?), dance card, megapixel, qi, ki.  So what is missing from the previous edition, MW10?  An informal survey of a half dozen pages shows that practically nothing of value is gone (lonelily, pein, Daoist are deleted).  Changes include a few new senses, illustrative quotes, revised definitions, and antedatings.  The entry for -er now shows beautifuller with double l, in concord with the entry for -ful.  There are about 70 more pages; MW10 had only about 5 more than MW9.<br />The total number of entries should be greeted with skepticism.  There are about a thousand undefined entries in a list of \\"non-\\" words, more than a thousand in the un- list, and several thousand more in sixteen additional lists.  If it occurs to you to seek coscenarist in the co- list, these lists might be of use.  There are also a great many highly technical terms, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate(s); writings that might contain these are apt to contain quite a few terms not found in this or any similar dictionary.  Nonetheless, MW11 looks pretty good after a comparison of a few random pages of this dictionary with the corresponding parts of four similarly-priced dictionaries.  At least two competitors have such entries as blank endorsement, blankety-blank, terra alba, or blague, but most or all omit such MW11 entries as:  term of art, blanket chest, or the adjective terminate.  Recently I found the word Atropos in a 1950 New-Zealand/British novel; it's not in MW11 (except in atropine's etymology), but was found in the competitors; on the other hand, only MW11 offers an explanation of what people who quirk this or that in a (usually) British novel are doing.<br />Definitions are sometimes a little unclear.  The 85-word definition for gyroscope is apt to set your head spinning, and you may need to reread it to determine a gyroscope's purpose (I'm not sure it says).  There's a sensible usage note for \\"hopefully\\", but MW11's appeal to \\"disjuncts\\" is less likely to persuade than the competitors' references to \\"sentence adverbs\\" or something similar.  Many more illustrative examples would help.<br />One appendix contains foreign words and phrases; it's unclear why \\"a la mode\\" or Weltschmerz are in the main listing with \\"a la page\\" or Weltbild in the appendix.  Other appendices list biographic and geographic entries, so, confronted with an unfamiliar proper noun, you may be unsure where to look.  Gretna Green, is that biographical or geographical?  (Neither, but MW11 has it nonetheless.)  These appendices suit the publisher, since during MW11's life there will be new censuses that affect the geographic entries and deaths, elections, awards, etc., that affect the biographic entries, and Merriam can reset the relatively few pages of the appendices more easily than many pages of the main listing.  Nonetheless, it is inconvenient for the user.<br />The final page contains the addresses for the Language Research Service.  The introduction to MW10 informed us that there is no evidence for the form \\"merer\\", so years ago I sent the LRS their first citation; it happens that OED provided another, and an Internet search for \\"even merer\\" provides four more, but MW11's introduction still claims that there is no evidence for it.  LRS is better at providing information; it gave me a Robert Frost citation to accompany my grandaunt's expression \\"the cat wanted the guest to make of her\\".<br />A nice feature is the date of earliest known appearance for each word.  MW11 extends this to words like \\"jehu\\" that come from a proper name (less clear is why Jehu is in the main listing rather than the biographical appendix), though possiblythe date applies to Jehu rather than jehu.  Similarly, the date for clueless applies to its literal use, not to the modern idiomatic use whose date might interest you.  Definitions are given in date order, so you can usually see how meanings develop over time.  Most unfamiliar words have only a single definition, or the unfamiliar meaning you seek may be the oldest, so this is a win-win feature for the user.<br />The dictionary comes with a wonderful CD (optional at higher price), with which many objections disappear.  It is much harder to find coscenarist, bo, ked, or Gretna Green with the print edition than with the CD, which incidentally expands abbreviations.  You can locate all entries having a usage note containing the word Scottish.  Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an easy way to search for all occurrences of Scottish in definitions, etymologies, and usage notes simultaneously, though there is a cumbersome way to do this with an advanced search.  It seems pronunciations aren't searchable beyond rhymes and homophones, so for example you cannot find all words with the rare sound that ends \\"smooth\\", or all pronunciations marked with the obelus (division sign) that indicates controversy.  (Merriam is invited to add the obelus to the first pronunciation of bruschetta, which deviates from the Italian.)  With the CD you can also find the other 27-letter single-word entry, the longest word(s) with no repeated letter, the anagrams of abcdeflos or Minnesota, or all words whose earliest known appearance falls in a particular year (the most recent appears to be 2000, for tanga, the Tajiki \\"cent\\"); if solving crosswords, you can find words of the form ?p??m?.<br />Certainly I would not recommend buying a college dictionary without a CD version.  Beyond that it is hard to choose, if you can afford just one.  My inclination is that if you are involved in scientific or technical pursuits, this is probably the right one.  Otherwise, you may be better off with one ofthe competitors.  I don't recommend owning precisely two dictionaries however; you will need a third as a tiebreak.	2003-08-04

It was a compendium of all words found in any of five college dictionaries of that era, which predates computer-assisted lexicography.  One of them went out of print soon after.  Some, but not all, more recent editions of the remaining four have provided new entries for subsequent editions of the OSPD.  As the current OSPD is about a decade old, quite possibly it lacks the new words from any college dictionary's latest edition.  Furthermore, at least two new college-style dictionaries have entered the marketplace, and one of the old ones is reliably reported to have fired all its lexicographers.<br />This is no longer the official source used in clubs and tournaments.  Their official wordlist includes about 200 forms ranging from what is mildly offensive mainly in lexicographic circles (e.g.: libber, peeing) to extremely offensive (the f-word, the n-word, etc.).  The latest printing of the paperback OSPD, 3rd edition, has silently deleted about a dozen forms (da, skiwears, etc.) to make it less unofficial, though at the cost of making it slightly incompatible with earlier printings that your neighbors might use.<br />It's not a dictionary.  Definitions are often so incomplete that you cannot even use this book to check spellings.  Pronunciations are non-existent.  It is sometimes not straightforward to find what is listed, so that REGLOW is present, though it appears several pages before REGMA.  The overwhelming majority of people who enjoy Scrabble want to know more about words than this opuscule provides.<br />Whether it's Scrabble is a thornier question.  Most people tend to regard Scottish words as foreign words not acceptable under the rules.  With this dictionary you don't even have the opportunity to reject Scotticisms, since they're not marked.  And there are a lot of them, the majority from that 30-year-old out-of-print dictionary, which hadn't been thoroughly revised in at least60 years.  On the other hand, fewer than half the Scottish words you might find in a Scottish-English literary work are present, and still fewer of the Scottish words found in a typical Scottish-language website.  (I refer to Scottish, not Gaelic.)<br />Most people think that Scrabble words should be spelled correctly, yet many OSPD entries reflect spellings no longer found in dictionaries, some of which appeared only briefly in only one of the five college dictionaries which were consulted in one or more printings to form this book.  Nearly all English words had a variety of spellings before civilization settled on a correct one.  In particular, some sixty years ago scientists agreed internationally on the spellings of certain technical terms, thereby rejecting spellings (such as chlorin and chlorid) that still abound in the OSPD, even though they disappeared from the better dictionaries long ago and have for the most part disappeared even from the dictionaries from which they were taken thirty years ago.<br />Some OSPD words are immediately suspect, such as et as in \\"I et my supper\\".  You can find this in precisely one currently available college dictionary.  You won't be able to check most suspect words in whatever dictionary you happen to own, since they're found in only one of the various editions consulted, often not the most recent printing.  In other words the very lexicographers who originally included the suspect word often rejected it for a future printing.  Skilless, outcavil, miseat, toadless, afars, ..., the list seems endless.<br />I certainly wouldn't recommend this book for schools, or any place where children might be present!  I recognize that spelling and grammar are not as highly regarded as they used to be, but if a child's first exposure is to the spelling janty (unused for a couple of centuries and found only in the out-of-print 1973 dictionary) then the standard jaunty will always seem strange.  And similarly for hundreds or thousands of other examples.<br />In fact, based on a partial survey, I would estimate that 5% of the OSPD words cannot be found in any current dictionary.  This includes a number of short words that will appear on virtually every gameboard if you choose OSPD.  Even two-letter words such as al, es, de (as in Charles de Gaulle), and a couple others are in the 5%.<br />On the other hand, once you use OSPD for a while you will be accustomed to seeing informal words, so the absence of perp will astonish you.  The eminently useful word qi may well be familiar to you from real life and is probably in whatever current college dictionary you may own (and even for Scrabble you must have such a dictionary to check on words longer than 8 letters), but it's not in OSPD.  This work was last revised about a decade ago and you might as well wait for an up-to-date version, though since it is unofficial, a new edition may be further away than the long-awaited 4th Unabridged.<br />The best that can be said for this book is that your regular college dictionary is unlikely to provide any basis for accepting vainest and plainer while rejecting mainer and mainest, or for drawing a line somewhere in a list such as stupider, rapider, vapider, hispider.  The OSPD line may not always be sensible:  e.g., exactly one of positiver and negativer is acceptable, and loudlier is one of five comparative -ly adverbs.  So if this sort of issue is one you cannot resolve in any other way, you may want this book, especially if you agree to use only a standard dictionary for browsing.<br />I would nonetheless recommend using a standard college dictionary for Scrabble.  The American Heritage High School Dictionary apparently contains everything in the College edition except for words that provoke offense, so it would be suitable for school use.  If your friends and neighbors use some other dictionary for Scrabble, that should only increase the variety the game affords so long as you treat the matter sensibly.	2003-08-04

While the math is not always trivial, it is presented in a fashion that at least gives the reader a chance to see what is going on, and it is always summarized in a fashion to give the reader the big picture even if the details must remain a bit hazy.<br />More than that, it is a work of biography, and history, and culture, by a writer who has a way with words.  Better in every respect than the other Riemann Hypothesis book I reviewed a couple months ago.<br />If only the author would write a similar book on particle physics and string theory!	2003-07-19

On the whole neither the police nor the amateur sleuth/tour-guide achieve much with their detection until the sudden denouement explains all.  Still, a pretty enjoyable read throughout, and there are enough clues that you might solve the case ahead of them.	2003-06-15
US	52929149	R9FLDOG0G0S6H	0066210704	631741128	The Music of the Primes: Searching to Solve the Greatest Mystery in Mathematics	Books	3	45	59	N	Y	Could have been better	This book \\"tells a story of eccentric and brilliant men\\" who have investigated the Riemann hypothesis and related matters, and tells it fairly well.  If it were solely about the mathematicians, I might well have given four stars; I know very little independent information about them with which to check the author's story.<br />But it tries to tell the story of the mathematics as well, though perhaps half-heartedly, and does not succeed at all well.  Such recurring metaphors as \\"Nature has picked the primes\\" seem rather strange to me, but there are quotations from other mathematicians that appear to state an opposing view.<br />It is not especially well written.  It is written in British rather than American English, which is perfectly all right in itself, and possibly accounts for \\"protest at\\" where \\"protest\\" would suffice.  Such analogies as \\"ley lines\\" might fly better overseas.  But \\"explanations for natural phenomenon\\" doesn't work anywhere.  In one sentence he writes of \\"irrational numbers\\" and \\"numbers with a non-repeating decimal expansion\\" as if they were different entities.  Earlier he hazily defines irrational numbers without using the word \\"ratio\\", allowing the questionable assertion \\"the name reflected mathematicians' sense of unease\\".  At one point he writes \\"N and N+1 cannot both be prime ... because at least one of these numbers is divisible by 2\\"; of course, exactly one is divisible by 2.  Although the seventh graders I have worked with are familiar with such terms as \\"integer\\" and \\"modulus\\", he muddies many a description by refusing to use them and many similar widely understood terms.  Although the term \\"factorise\\" (British for the verb \\"factor\\") is used, he can still write such cumbersome lines as \\"the fast way to crack numbers into the primes from which they are built\\" when he means simply \\"the fast way to factorise\\".<br />He describes the Ishango bone:  \\"Marked on it are three columns of four notches.  In one of the columns we find 11, 13, 17 and 19 notches....\\"  How did four notches change?  An appendix at least gives a website where the bone can be viewed.  The same appendix gives the author's own website, which appears to be inoperative.<br />While it may be hopeless to explain all the math in the book, the author could have done more.  He states Hilbert's seventh problem, and later states that it was solved, but does not say when, by whom, or even whether the answer was yes or no.  On page 200 he gives a fascinating formula in 26 variables which generates all primes but no other positive number, but fails to state what values the variables can take (presumably non-negative integers).  He adds, \\"some choices ... give a negative answer, and we just have to ignore them\\"; from what I can see, the googol non-negative choices for these variables with lowest sum will generate painfully few primes, so his comment is startlingly understated.  Nonetheless, it was nice to see such a formula in print; it hadn't even been discovered when I got a degree in math many years ago.  Possibly non-mathematicians will find this book's shortcomings less annoying than I have, and as a retired mathematician I certainly enjoyed such lines as \\"a trance is in fact very close to the state of mind that most mathematicians try to achieve\\".	2003-05-19

(Expect a few anachronisms, such as \\"kilometres\\", in these.)  McInerny himself contributes a Father Dowling story, set in the present, as well as a novella under his pseudonym Monica Quill.  While any anthology is inevitably a mixed bag, most readers will enjoy most of the stories in this volume, and will want to find more stories by some of the authors.  The term \\"Catholic\\" in the title, incidentally, includes \\"Anglican\\" and \\"Episcopal\\".  If you are attracted by the title, you are apt to enjoy the book.	2003-05-19

The selected words include some of my personal favorites, and a great many words completely new to me, some of which are new favorites.  The illustrations are ho-hum and may lead many readers to wish the space had been used for more words.  Luckily, the compiler plans a collection of weirder and wonderfuller words, which will be given some prosaic title by the publisher.<br />One caveat:  there are some racy entries, not enough to spur sales, but enough to give the book an X rating in some households and a PG-13 in many.  Too bad, as the book would otherwise be an excellent inspiration for many a young wordsmith.  Perhaps the compiler can be persuaded to gather a similar collection of words, like \\"googol\\", of interest to children and adults alike.  If only this collection had been just a shade more verecund!<br />I'll let you buy the book if you want to know the precise meanings of logodaedaly and verecund.	2003-03-06
US	52929149	R1SZ8CLZCW25IL	0142002267	437745521	Word Freak: Heartbreak, Triumph, Genius, and Obsession in the World of Competitive Scrabble Players	Books	4	4	12	N	Y	Some astute apercus	Early on, the author begins a sentence:  \\"Without knowing, I imagine...\\", and there seems to be a fair bit of that in this book.  On page 146, he attributes my refusal to grant him an interview to my being \\"too frustrated to rehash\\" my dictionary \\"battles\\".  (The main reason:  I had just completed an extensive email interview with a prospective author to whom I felt a sense of loyalty inasmuch as I had sold him my collection of Scrabble News.  The questions in that interview covered a lot of ground missing from this book, so I hope the book appears someday.)  Alas, lightning destroyed my surge protector and the computer on which my emailed refusal resided; without knowing, I imagine that it contained the phrase \\"word freaks\\", and I'd be real surprised if it contained any of the words \\"frustrated, rehash, battles\\".     Nonetheless, a leitmotiv of Mr. Fatsis' opus is his ability to lay out lucidly and fairly positions with which he may disagree, and he does so with respect to my thoughts on the official dictionary in the chapter titled \\"Words\\", and alludes to them on at least two other occasions.  Some of this chapter's astuter apercus appear to stem, without explicit credit, from an article I wrote for a language review, though the article appears in the sources on page 370 (of the paperback edition, which contains a 3-paragraph update to the original edition), and there are two direct, credited quotations.      There's a lot of information on the invention and marketing of the game.  But most of the book is about people, tournament enthusiasts.  Unfortunately, much of the focus is on the three players described by the author himself as \\"most extreme\\" in a classic understatement.  There's a tsunami of information on the author's own rise to expert ranks.  In this rather long book, there's still plenty of room for descriptions of a wide variety of other enthusiasts, most of whom I knew when I played, and the descriptions ring true even if one must be suspicious of details.  There's a lot of info on the clothes worn by interviewees, enough to make one wonder what the author himself wears.  The author would have done well to interview in addition a half dozen or so \\"blue-hairs\\", who collectively have enriched my life in countless ways; it's no wonder membership is meager when a significant portion thereof is mocked at the highest levels.     So why the four-star rating for so flawy a book?  Simply because it's so easy to ignore the rough parts to get to the good stuff.  There's enough profanity, drugs, etc., to disconcert many and warrant a PG-13 rating (and you might want to keep this or any Scrabble book away from your kids till after they take their SATs, since a lot of the acceptable words are misspellings in any other contemporary context).  But when the author puts his mind to it, he often finds le mot juste or a clever figure of speech.  (One of my favorites:  \\"stiffer than Al Gore\\".)            In my experience, perhaps 15% of people who find word games attractive want to play solely with the vocabulary they already know.  Such people are probably not reading this review, and in any case probably won't enjoy this book; the author tosses out words like \\"eidetic, hiragana, weltanschauung,\\" and dozens more with every expectation that you can look them up if necessary.             Of the other 85%, fewer than 1% find that they can long enjoy an environment where they are hustled into accepting forms like DE (as in \\"Charles de Gaulle\\"; I wish I were kidding).  For that 1%, this book could be the start or continuation of a great adventure.  And for the other 84%, including people like me now retired from clubs and tournaments, the book is a great read and will help confirm that the right decision has been made.	2002-12-11
US	52929149	R39OKHIFLTELZC	0399144153	321181480	Oxford American College Dictionary	Books	3	41	43	N	Y	Evidence of haste	This 2002 book is an abridgement of the excellent New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD, published 2001), with a price in line with other college dictionaries.  Unfortunately, there seem to be a few problem areas.<br />The first thing that will strike many college students and graduates is the almost complete absence of etymologies.  A few of the more interesting ones are highlighted with the heading WORD HISTORY; for example, this is one of very few sources that make clear why the Dutch for &quot;the cage&quot; appears in English as DECOY.  A few other etymologies appear with the heading ORIGIN.  For the most part, you won't find any.  It would seem that such information would add a lot to many entries, such as UBUNTU, TRIFFID, GROK, TOHUBOHU, and thousands more.  One consequence is that the usage note for ESKIMO refers to a deleted etymology.  Granted, the etymologies in most competitors have a lot of fluff; they'll show two of numerous older spellings of &quot;dog&quot; before implying that the trail grows cold in Old English; a simple &quot;&lt;OE&quot; or &quot;OE&lt;?&quot;should be enough.  The datings that appear in a few competitors and some other Oxford dictionaries would be a fine addition.<br />In a brief survey of one-word lowercase entries from LI to LIEDER in this and three comparable (college) dictionaries, it appears that coverage in this dictionary is nearly as good.  It is, however, the only one to omit LIAISE, LIBELANT, LIBELEE, LICENSURE, and an adjectival form for LIBATION (but the competitors disagree, two showing LIBATIONARY, one LIBATIONAL).  This dictionary relegates LIBERALISM to a run-on, a word for which the competition had relatively long entries; the difference is partly offset by a longer entry for LIBERAL.  But it was the only one not to relegate LIBERTARIANISM to a run-on.  It has only run-ons for LIBERATION, LICHENOLOGY, and LIBRETTIST (the precise relation between a librettist and a libretto is not one of the senses given elsewherefor the suffix -IST).  Two competitors explain the missing LIDLESS, a poetic form that may well still be met in colleges.  It is the only one to list LICENSED, a form unlikely to be sought.  Elsewhere, it is not hard to find entries that all the competitors omit; WAQF and CINQ will intrigue Scrabblers.<br />More than a dozen pages are blank.  This is certainly a surprise, since most publishers allot their lexicographers however many pages can be printed affordably for the intended sales price, and they scramble to squash the available material into what seems to be too small a space.  Larger Oxford dictionaries would provide plenty of material for filling these pages up.<br />No doubt Roger Staubach is pleased to have an entry, and would be even more so if his name were spelled correctly.  It's unclear whether users would expect to find anything about him in a dictionary, but this one tries to include a lot of currently famous sports and entertainment personalities, and users might enjoy this feature.  Cal Ripken makes an appearance too, but since the entry hasn't been updated, his 2001 retirement is unnoted.  The space devoted to Perry, a tennis star from the thirties, might have been better devoted to Commodore Perry in a college dictionary, and there are many similar examples.<br />Unnecessarily in my opinion, an illustration for skyscraper has been edited to remove the World Trade Center.  There are quite a number of illustrations, many adding little besides a break in what some readers might consider monotonous text.  Whoever drew the picture for hyperbola has little appreciation for asymptotes.  Every country comes with a large map, showing very few cities other than capitals, and mostly useless.  The result is that the Northern Mariana Islands are shown with greater detail than in the National Geographic Atlas, while most of the largest U.S. cities appear on no map whatever.  It's unclear that dictionary users expect maps, and those that do will probably look elsewhere.<br />Inevitably a new work has slipups here and there,  of them possibly attributable to the abridgement.  The entry for the noun SHANKS' MARE reads &quot;used to walking&quot;; you need the complete entry from NOAD to make any sense of the definition, which in itself is more of an explanation than something that can take the place of a noun.  The symbol for SECOND didn't survive intact.  The entries for GOODNESS and SAKE disagree on the punctuation of  &quot;for goodness' sake&quot;.  Only the illustrative citation for Spartan hints that its metaphoric usage is now usually uncapitalized.  And the spelling Stonehendge appears.  At times one feels that one is the first human to be reading certain entries in their current form.  Information for REIS, BO, SH, ADELGID, etc., is present, but not anywhere you are likely to look.  On the other hand, &quot;Sly&quot; is cross-referenced to Stallone.<br />Kudos to Oxford for its sensible treatment of the spelling or usage of such entries as miniscule, flout/flaunt, plaintext, back seat, hopefully, disinterested, under way, supercede, they, and dozens more.  Hopefully a future edition will have something to say against the spelling KI for the word pronounced CHI and now usually spelled QI.  And hopefully we won't have to wait long for the Second Edition of this dictionary, a more patient and careful abridgement of NOAD.  Except for price and portability, nearly all the pluses of this work are found in NOAD, while most of the minuses mentioned above are not in NOAD.  For now, if you can afford only a college dictionary, I would have to recommend one of the others.	2002-12-05

(Begin with &quot;Staggerford&quot; itself.)  It unites and reunites many of the principal characters from its predecessors, most notably Agatha McGee, first seen in &quot;Staggerford&quot;, and Father Healy from &quot;North of Hope&quot;.  Relatively little new ground is broken in this short work, but I think readers will enjoy this recapitulation and summary of perhaps the most endearing set of novels in current fiction.	2002-10-05

Rather he highlights the principal similarities and differences.  Along the way, relying no doubt on his experiences with hundreds of inquiring Boston College students, he seeks to ease the most common misconceptions and stumbling blocks about Christian teaching.  Even if he does not address your specific questions, the method of approaching truth may help you.  Of particular interest to me was the resolution of the paradox suggested by the observations:  &quot;Do you say that a deed is good because God wills it? ... The alternative is that God wills the deed because it is good in itself. ... Does God bow down to a law higher than himself?&quot;; apparently Kreeft's answer &quot;is a well-known solution to your dilemma&quot;.  Shortly thereafter, &quot;I had not explicitly connected the doctrine of omniscience with the doctrine of creation before&quot;, suggesting possibly a brand-new contribution by Kreeft.  Obviously there is a great deal more to ponder in this book, which is well worth rereading, and perhaps when I do, I will understand why a character named Sophia Sikh makes so brief an appearance.  All in all, the author clearly seeks to speak the truth in love, and this book is well worth the attention of any who seek the truth in love.	2002-07-06

Suffice it to say that the plot thickens agreeably, one of the motives is singularly original, and there are plenty of the brief philosophical observations we have come to associate with McInerny's writings.

The beginning, middle, and end all seem quite unlike one another to me, with the end worth whatever effort it takes to get through the middle.  The book could be quite a vocabulary enhancer, as this excerpt may exemplify:  &quot;For centuries I dreamed -- or was it chiliads? or only one long night? -- But why ask? for time had nothing to do with me; I was in the land of thought -- farther in, higher up than the seven dimensions, the ten senses: ... I dreamed cycles, I say, but, for aught I knew or can tell, they were the solemn, aeonian march of a second, pregnant with eternity.&quot; (The book provided my first encounters with &quot;glode&quot; and with &quot;crown&quot; -- rhymes with &quot;grown&quot;.)  Indeed the book can be interpreted as a series of dreams, at times perhaps confusing.  Perhaps the best that can be said of any book is that it is rereadable, and I certainly plan to reread this one some day.<br />This edition contains a worthwhile introduction by C.S. Lewis.  The punctuation in this edition is nearly invisible.	2002-01-30

Focusing on a fairly narrow area (&quot;irregular&quot; verbs and also nouns in English and also other languages), the author presents theories to account for this aspect of language, and the experiments which tend to support or refute those theories.  Not surprisingly perhaps, his own theories fare pretty well.  Since the focus is somewhat narrow, I would recommend that you first read another of Pinker's language books.  (The author would probably enjoy MacDonald's &quot;Lilith&quot; if only to add examples of glide/glode crow/crown to his collection of English irregular verbs!)	2002-01-30

She finds a page from her lost senior-year journal squirreled away in her students' assignments.  This is just the beginning of a long mystery, beautifully told.  The parts occurring in the present (1995-1996) are told in present tense (first part of the novel); the parts that occurred twenty years ago in the past tense (second part); the two times are interleaved throughout the even tenser third part.  The setting and characters are made alive for the reader.  The first 300 pages are really quite good, and when the sleuthing begins in earnest for the denouement it makes the typical Kinsey Millhone perils-of-Pauline ending pale in comparison.  The quality of the writing (not to mention the pluralization of corniculum as corniculi and one or two other lapsus linguae) suggests that the author (a former Latin teacher) has found her true calling at last, and I can hardly wait for her next novel.	2002-01-25
US	52929149	R3BC4WEDMQI3JR	0684842564	93185568	The Franchise Affair	Books	5	9	10	N	N	Highly Original Mystery	This is not your typical murder mystery; in fact, the crime is not murder, but possibly a worse one:  false accusation of a kidnapping and beating.  The resolution may be a little disappointing in that a portion of it comes about not as a result of sleuthing, but pretty much out of the blue.  Nonetheless, the characterizations are finely drawn, and the suspense maintained to the end.  At the end one might suspect that this has not really been a mystery at all, but another kind of fiction in the form of a mystery.  My own rereading tends to confirm this idea at least for myself.  It also confirms that the mystery elements have been dealt with fairly by the author, including the suitcases, which are explained within a few paragraphs of their introduction.  Along the way, the author takes more than a few potshots at \\"woolly thinking\\", entertaining in their own right.  It's a pity we have only about eight novels from her, since half are outstanding in their own sui-generis way.	2002-01-22

The author has no inclination to conceal his rather acerbic personality, so you may find yourself rooting for the trucks early on.  But keep reading, there's many a worthwhile nugget awaiting, and it's easy enough to discard the refuse.  By page 291, when the author or his editors or the Lonely Planet reprinters get the spelling of &quot;fuchsia&quot; right on the fourth attempt, you will feel that anything is possible.  So when the author cuts short his description of the final leg, decides not to undertake a planned trip to Northern Ireland, and leaves the book in its present rather untrim state, you're apt to feel a considerable sadness.<br />The maps provided by Lonely Planet add value to this edition.	2002-01-05

This book is about the author's parents, how they met in Nazi Germany as musicians in the Jewish Culture Association, married, and eventually escaped to the United States.  Sometimes the focus is not specifically on his parents, but on broader aspects of this apparently little-known Association, or of life under the Nazis as a whole.  It's a beautiful book about a very ugly time.  Since the musicians were prohibited from playing the music of Beethoven and the other most familiar German composers (eventually Austrian composers such as Mozart fell under the ban), their music often included less familiar works, such as the title piece (the nickname of Nielsen's fourth symphony), so the reader will almost surely get a broader insight to the classical repertory as well.	2002-01-05

The characters are well drawn, and their motivations made clear notwithstanding the considerable cultural differences between their time/place and ours.  Not a book you will soon forget -- highly recommended.	2002-01-05

You may even find yourself doing some rereading just to see how it was done.  I may have said too much already -- some other reviewers may have said too much -- so I simply encourage you to read and enjoy.	2002-01-05
US	52929149	RG5AKHEXKV4FV	0670882356	985444832	When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan	Books	5	10	13	N	Y	The Biography you'll be apt to remember	Truly this is a wonderful book.  Even the familiar anecdotes are presented in a historical framework made possible by the passage of years.  Much of the book is based on recent interviews and will be new.  Patti Davis appears to have finally grown up.  In one context, the author herself writes &quot;I was wrong&quot;.  There's a lot more to Reagan than winning the Cold War or bringing about the biggest economic boom in history, as anyone young or old should be capable of perceiving, especially with this book.  The book contains a few diversions, even a reference to the current President's September 20 speech, which are of interest.<br />We can look forward to more books from this author, even if just a compilation of her best Wall Street Journal commentaries, and we can hope that she will have a more competent editor.  This book has spellings such as &quot;fourty&quot;, &quot;challange&quot;, and &quot;envelopes&quot; for &quot;envelops&quot;.  &quot;... one day after the shooting&quot; Reagan is at his ranch.  Eight weeks elapse between March 30 and May 13.  Perhaps worst of all, Reagan's famous identification of the Soviet Union as the &quot;focus of evil&quot; becomes the &quot;locus of evil&quot;, not once but twice.<br />Particularly moving are the chapter on the day of the assassination attempt and the account of the author's 1998 encounter with the ailing President.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-19

But the denouement, right after the mystery is solved, seems highly unsatisfactory to me, for reasons that can hardly be discussed without spoiling the otherwise clever plot.	2001-12-12

In much the same manner as stained glass appears differently on a sunny day depending on whether one is outside or inside a church, so with Catholic thought.  A sampling:  &quot;God in search of us is not just an example of religion.  It is not another episode in spirituality.  It is, the Catholic Church proposes, nothing less than the truth of the world.&quot;  A great Christmas present for yourself or anyone you know, now or any time during the year.	2001-12-12

This book is for you.  Though technical at times, it appears to be self-contained.  The author respectfully discusses views that differ from his own.  The classical pronunciation taught in classrooms differs in small but perhaps significant ways from the pronunciation reconstructed in this book.  At least it will no longer be a mystery why Vergil and other poets &quot;elide&quot; the final syllables of words ending in &quot;m&quot; when the following word begins with a vowel.	2001-12-12

All the standard elements of the genre are present, leavened with Norwegian humor (What does Sweden have that Norway doesn't?  Good neighbors.), recipes (lutefisk is fish steeped in lye, so I'll aim for the ginger cookies), and such original similes as &quot;Her voice was as bitter as an unripe lingonberry&quot;.  Highly recommended.	2001-12-12
US	52929149	R3CLG0NHUVK9OR	188335725X	702458717	Let's Read Latin: Introduction to the Language of the Church (English and Latin Edition)	Books	3	28	29	N	N	An &quot;A+&quot; for enthusiasm, but	This would be a tough book to learn Latin from.  It contains a great many errors.  Perhaps the first is on page 5:  &quot;In debitoribus nostris, we have another case of both debitum and noster.  First of all, they are plural, our debts, our trespasses; and they are in the ABLATIVE case.  Forgive us with respect to, or as to, our trespasses.&quot;  Of course, &quot;debitoribus&quot; means &quot;debtors&quot;, not &quot;debts&quot;, here in the dative.  The book's typefaces make everything a little clearer, but it's still wrong.  Or on the last page of the main text, &quot;tria&quot; is held to be feminine, whereas it is neuter (tres declines like any 3rd declension adjective).  Or in the middle, where &quot;prodest&quot; is held to be from &quot;prodeo&quot; rather than &quot;prosum&quot;.  What is omitted may be just as serious, though harder to prove; for example, I did not see the explanation of the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;omnia&quot; anywhere.  The tape explains the pronunciation of c before &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, but not the similar variation in the pronunciation of g nor the more complex variation in the pronunciation of t before i under certain circumstances.  The tape accents spiritui on the first syllable, whereas it should be on the second.  The tape contains a few false starts that could have been corrected.  If you want to learn Latin, I would recommend enthusiastically Collins's &quot;A Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin&quot;; if you want more practice thereafter, by all means the annotated texts in McInerny's book can be helpful, and you will know you are mastering the language when you can spot errors similar to those mentioned above.  As an admirer of McInerny's mystery novels and (though I am not really a qualified reviewer) his philosophical texts, as well as &quot;Crisis&quot; magazine which he edits, this book was a disappointment to me.  But I will certainly give him an A+ for enthusiasm, which is apparent on virtually every page.	2001-12-04
US	52929149	R35YY7J6NZ4HTO	019511227X	874873819	The New Oxford American Dictionary	Books	5	139	146	N	Y	The Best One-Volume Dictionary Ever?	--- This, probably, is the one to buy. But decide for yourself...<BR>--- The New Oxford American Dictionary (NOAD) may be regarded as the American translation of the New Oxford English Dictionary (NODE), published in England in 1998. A great many definitions are word-for-word identical between the two works. However, NOAD introduces significant improvements.<BR>--- For example, NODE omits pronunciations for &quot;ordinary, everyday&quot; words, and as a result you get no hint as to whether &quot;corgi&quot; rhymes with &quot;orgy&quot; or &quot;Porgie&quot;. NOAD provides pronunciations for all words, using a more sensible respelling. Furthermore, entries contain raised dots to separate syllables. Unfortunately, the dots are more prominent than the hyphens, which are mere flyspecks in both dictionaries even though that is precisely the sort of information a user might need.<BR>--- NODE has no illustrations, which are abundant in NOAD. The crude maps are close to useless, and many pictures are mere eye candy, but some are worthwhile, for example the illustration for &quot;pasta&quot;, where you may encounter &quot;orzi&quot; for the first time.<BR>--- A great many NODE entries have been deleted, especially those for Indian, Australian, African, and some British English entries such as &quot;gain-up&quot;, precisely the items that might send an American user scurrying for the dictionary. Proper names of British import are frequent casualties. On the other hand, many American entries have been added, including the New England beverage &quot;frappe&quot;, but not &quot;tonic&quot;. Wherever NODE indicates that a word is &quot;American&quot;, that designation is omitted, whereas NOAD supplies &quot;British&quot; for other entries. Of course, the fact that a particular word is &quot;American&quot; will often be of interest and perhaps importance to an American user.<BR>--- Spellings have been Americanized, and some entries, such as those for &quot;corgi&quot; and &quot;Welsh corgi&quot;, have in effect swapped places.<BR>--- Political correctness is sometimes apparent. Someone decided there should be a new entry &quot;altar girl&quot;, which (mutatis mutandis) is a clone of NODE's entry for &quot;altar boy&quot;. Someone else decided that the definition of &quot;altar boy&quot; could be recast in terms of &quot;altar server&quot;, but the latter term received no entry of its own. The result is a curious lack of parallelism that might lead readers to suspect that altar boys and girls have dissimilar functions. Something of the same sort befell the entries for &quot;chairman&quot; and &quot;chairwoman&quot;.<BR>--- NODE's etymologies for &quot;cola&quot; and &quot;Coke-bottle&quot; may be regarded as adequate, but since NOAD deleted the entries for the trademarks &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; and &quot;Coke&quot;, the etymologies no longer suffice. NODE has an entry for the archaic exclamation &quot;gad&quot;, which NOAD retains, while adding an entry for the interjection &quot;Gad&quot; with virtually the same meaning. NOAD's deletion of the ballet term &quot;chaine&quot; is hardly complimentary. In the entry for &quot;gigabyte&quot;, NOAD places a digit and its exponent on separate lines, albeit hyphenated. The introductory matter retains &quot;homonym&quot; in a chiefly British sense. <BR>--- The cover claims that NOAD offers a &quot;descriptive picture of American English&quot;, which often seems to mean they have not put themselves in the user's place. You will have to go elsewhere if you seek clarification of &quot;chinks&quot; as used in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; or &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;. If you read that Buddha was sitting under a bo tree and desire further information on this botanical specimen, you are unlikely to be enlightened even though NOAD has the information. If your mother says you have &quot;hazel eyes&quot;, you will think her color-blind if you rely on the NOAD definition. For a generation, most Christians have celebrated &quot;Passion Sunday&quot; a week later than NOAD indicates.<BR>--- NOAD is probably the first one-volume American dictionary to include such avifauna from our 50th state as &quot;ou, o'o, iiwi&quot;; it's the first to include the Madagascar birds &quot;asity&quot; and &quot;fody&quot;, but &quot;jery&quot; remains to be discovered.<BR>--- For sheer browseability, NOAD is outstanding. It's a great book to have at your side if you are the phone-a-friend for a Millionaire contestant.<BR>--- All the above quibbles can be multiplied a thousandfold for this or any work based on millions of decisions by dozens of people. As the owner of more than fifty English lexicons, I would recommend this one-volume dictionary over all competitors. Consider purchasing it with CD-ROM (not available when I bought mine). If the price or size of this dictionary is beyond your grasp, a reasonable alternative is &quot;Webster's New World College Dictionary&quot;, which incidentally gets &quot;chinks&quot;, &quot;hazel&quot;, and &quot;Passion Sunday&quot; correctly, while concealing the information for &quot;bo&quot; in the same way as NOAD.	2001-11-25
