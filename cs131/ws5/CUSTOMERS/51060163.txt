US	51060163	R2WH9M0T8167IM	1591023092	468919780	Star Of Gypsies	Books	5	3	4	N	N	An exquisite masterpiece	I've been delighted by this unusual book of the great Robert Silverberg. A persecuted minority, the Gypsies, is used in this fictional tale, to show rhe folly and cruelty of those who despise human diversity. Here is a fantastic apologue on human potential, inventiveness and potential, both for greatness and utter stupidity, the latter represented in the three pretenders on the Imperial crown. These grave matters are narrated in a very witty, brillant style, where Silverberg's humorous persona is at its best. Yakoub is a magnificent trickster, ironic, rckless, self-centered and caring  for friends and his people at the same time: you'll love him, and his friends, Julien, Polarca, Damiano. <br />Other than that, you have a grand panorama of a Universe, planets  unspeakably horrid as Trinigalee Chase and Alta Hannalanna, and beautiful planets like Xinamu and sthange Mulianu. an influence of Douglas Adam's Hitch-hiker's Guide cannot be excluded.  A magnificent work, Silverberg at his best!	2005-08-31

Cardinal Malvezzi, an undescript italian prelate, has no hopes nor fears for himself.His vague inquietudes, as a new day comes on Rome for yet anoter inconclusive scrutiny, open this mastepiece of a novel. This Conclave will be long and difficult, it will not be easy to find a worthy successor for a Pope so great as the one recently gone to the embrace of Jesus. The Holy Ghost seems to have gone on vacation, whilst a series of grotesque incidents, invasions of rats, scorpions,bats, fought over by cats, chickens and owls movimentate the startled assembly, that only finds peace in a turkish bath built on the Vatican premises made on suggestion of the Estonian delegate, to make the prelates enjoy \\"the delights of clausure\\". Two American delegates aren't so keen of these pleasures and try to escape, whilst hallucinations and the daze of tribal dancing convinces the delegates that the Devil has come, obscuring all the saints on the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. A stern defensor of ortodoxy meets a quite embarrassing  end shortly after have received, literrally, the egg in his face; a mysterious disappearance of an African Exorcist cardinal, and his startling return will be the events that sall bring the exausted cardinals to their final choice. <br />At times hysterically funny (one has in mind the humour of Mark Twain mixed to the sense of the absurd of Sterne)and posing serious questions on the nature of Faith and Religion, this novel is quite satisfactory. I recommend it to the readers of all persuasions in the matter of religion. It'll make them laugh and think. A not so common combination.	2005-04-09

The tough Dee and gentle Ryo are simply adorable, and the fact that they are both supposed to be detectives at NYPD Police requires only a moderate amount of suspension of disbelief. Bikky and Carol,two  wayward kids entrusted to Ryo's (and Dee)  care are absolutely endearing. Notably there is a zany humour pervading the series that, though for \\"late teens\\" and not recommended for the homophobic, is narrated in a gentle and poetic way, no concession made to vulgarity or crude scenes.

It's not a normal, straightforward narrative.It has the flavor of the post-apocalyptic novel, though it's not clear what kind of apocalypse occurred.There are recollections of civil right issues, of the hippie culture of sixties-seventies, of the search of one's own identity, of status differences, of street gangs (the scorpions). One notices that the protagonists himself seems to be writing the book, or one similar. I think that as metaphysical novels go, this book is very similar, in concept, to Calenture of Storm Constantine and The island of the day before of Umberto Eco.  What is being described are states of mind and metaphysical concepts in the form of characters of a novels. And yet some characters in the novel spring vividly, like  gentle Tak, the overbearing Nightmare, the self-delusional Ms  Richards, Layla and Denny, Kidd's friends. As for Kidd's identity...at the end all becomes clear (in a sense). <br />To conclude, Dhalgren is the \\"Total novel\\" of the Seventies, like Infinite Jest of David Foster wllace was of the Eighties and Cryptonomicon of Nel Stephenson wasofthe Nineties If you like  the genre, and aren't homophobic, it's one of the best!	2004-10-03

A group of these nomads, called \\"Star's Eye\\" stops near Ari Famber's house. Ari is the daughter of dead scientist Ewan Famber, who performed genetics experiments on her. The leader of the Star's Eye, Leila Saatchi, erstwhile colleague of Ewan Famber, convinces Ari, troubled by  sexual problems, to join the group, headed toward the metropolis called Arkady. Here lives another colleague of Ewan Famber, the robopsychologist Quinx Roirbak, who, Leila hopes, will be able to deal with Ari's problems. With Quinx lives the obscure scientist Tammuz Malamute, a neuropsychologist in search of a job. Tammuz finds himself psychologically counseling the once street boy Zambia Crevecoeur, who unwittingly sold himself to the female pimp Jahsaxa Penumbra, who had him surgically modified as an intersex. <br />A great part of the novel is dedicated to Ari's voyage to Arkady with the group,a group of  bizarre gypsy-like, vaguely hippie men and women, who'll help Ari to star coping with her identity.  <br />The sexual energy she has been made capable of manifesting would change the life of all characters, celebrating the healing power of love and empathy. <br />This is a very interesting futuristic novel, blending elements of science-fiction and the fantastic in a style reminding us of Master of Space and Time of Rudy Rucker, and raising, in an intriguing way, the ever problematic issues of genetic manipulation and  envirinment preservation. The world, as in Nemesis by Isaac Asimov,that also features a problematic adolescent,  shall be saved by a child. <br />A celebration of love, sexuality and human potential that's pure Storm Constantine <br />	2004-09-06

The comic, the insightful and the dramatic mix in an unique, original way. One of my favourite examples of this is &quot;The Boffer&quot;, when Dennis Savage is debating whit Bud wether to attend a college reunion with his straight classmates, and the emotional and social factors entailed, while Little Kiwi displays, as a comical counterpoint, his very meagre skills as a trick magician.  The characters are very finely detailed and lovely, the dialogue is worthy of the better Noel Coward.

Their general Ashmael finds this abandoned facility, were slaves hostlings were conditioned to breed sons to the military, sons who would join the Varrish troops. Varrs were hermaphrodite, like all Wraeththu, but the Varrs imposed and coerced a strict separation of sex roles. Lisia, left alone to care for 182 wraeththu children, is fearful and resentful  of the intervention of the Gelaming \\"Liberators\\", that he's ben taught to consider \\"the enemy\\". Lisia has the support of the new Governor of Megalithica, Lord Swift Parasiel, and of his hostling Cobweb (from Bewitchments of Love and Hate). There shall be a political confrontation between the Parsics (Varrs adopted new name)and the Gelaming over the future of Lisia and the children that will be resolved at Immanion, the Gelaming capital.<BR>This book is notable for the character of Lisia,whose diary we read: her/his narration is tender and touching, yet chilling as he/she describes the exploitations, indoctrinations and lies of which he/she, her/his companions and the children (called harlings) are subjected from doctors and administrators of the breeding farm. At first naive and trusting, Lisia is led to discover the lies and the painfulness of his/her condition, her forced unfulfilled maternity. Some passages recalls the novel \\"Brave new World\\" of Aldous Huxhley for the chilling contrast between the blind trust of the indoctrinated and the unfeeling cruelty of the indoctrinators. Very good is also the depiction of Swift and Cobweb: their relathionship is examined in some very poignant scenes, where we feel both the undercurrent of tension between hostling and son and their reciprocal affection, when they should cope, in resolving Lisia's predicament,with unpleasant discoveries about their consort and father Terzian. <BR>This is, in conclusion, a novel which stand comparison whit Storm Constantine's own novels, notably Bewitchments of Love and Hate and Wraiths of Will and Pleasure; Breeding Discontent shares whit those novels the uncanny similarities of the events depicted (set in an alternate reality), with events and issues of the very recent history of the world we live in. When I've been moved by Lisia's story, I was intrigued by those echoes between fantasy and reality	2003-11-03

Luscious style,  magnificent attention to details, great historical reconstruction. The first two parts and the characters of Sugar and William Rackam are just great. Then the author neglects the story of the major protagonists to delve in the pityful details of  some of the three most boring characters found in literature: the wife of William Rackam, who is languishing from an unspecified illness, sees angels and has fits of crude sincerity, after which loses consciousness; the brother of the protagonist, who would be a pastor, but doesn't feel worthy of it, because of his carnal desires, and pays prostitutes to listen his sermons; finally a member of the Salvation Army (or something similar), a lady very gentle, awfully boring, who  suffers from tubercolosis. Reading in details of the lives of those three makes a depressing and boring read indeed.<BR>Moreover, the daughter of Henry Rackam enters the scene only in the final chapter, we almost never see her before, yet we are  au courant of every development in Rackham House: seeing her grow would have been much more interesting than the inner torments of the undecided parson ( a character almost laughable).<BR>As for the end, the book halts abruptly in the middle of a rather dramatic development, loose ends  floating in mid-air everywhere.And the author, in the final note, is not deigning to explain if there will be a sequel, nor why he decided to end his book there. <BR>Read a real victorian novel, this is my advice	2003-10-26

I just love galaxy-spanning novels, space -archaeology and cosmic mysteries.<BR>Here you find all this, beautifully written in a gothic post-cyberpunk style.

The two main personae are obsessed egotistic zealots that would breezily commit genocide to achieve their ends. And the others aren't much better. Also, the novel is overlong, as usual whit most of today's Science-Fiction and Fantasy production. Still, it's an interesting read whit good ideas, and an intriguing alien equivalent of a biblical myth that would interest the writer Storm Constantine, whose gothic style is similar to Reynold's. <BR>My vote would be thus 3 and a half.

As if this stereotype of the humanist  scholar totally oblivious of science matters was not annoying enough, there's an extravagant overemphatization of the rift between Science and Religion.Here seems to be an unbridgeable chasm, a situation that is rather different fron reality ( see the latest pronouncement of the Pope in the matter).   <BR>This said, it's a good thriller, whit  carboard characters  (how many post-feminism  women-of-action way smartest that the male protagonist have you seen?) who don't do much in terms of human interaction,but,hey, they've got to save the world!	2003-08-29

He is Eliot's Prufrock made novel. Not for him the daring and indeed the taking of the slightest responsibility or risk; and one feels that he also is consoling himself thinking he could have been something hideous.<BR>He's not hideous: he's petty, selfish, and  he puts himself uwittingly in awkward situations because he lacks the courage to assert himself. But he could say that whit a self like his, there's little to assert. Here's a story of a man you can feel superior of, narrated in a manner profoundly influenced by Freudian theories. But he uses the great intuitions of Freud only to justify his own mediocrity and egocentrism. In a way it's funny, in another slightly annoying. It's a good psychoanalytical novel,though.	2003-04-10

The description of this imaginary world, similar but very different from our own is masterfully detailed, the dialogues witty and brilliant,the characthers very intriguing.  I recommend this book to any reader who likes fantastic (or alternate) history and romance.

The portait of an Emperor troubled by the growing quarrels of Christian factions over issues that to him looked like absurd and abstruse niceties of theological doctrine, of a soul tormented  between future and past, quixotically striving to restore a world now gone, as he himself must see whit  his eyes ... all this is  magnificently and convincingly described. But Gore Vidal managed also, as I said, to portray the transition between two worlds, being somewhat biased to paganism,as the  athmosphere of the book is that of a melancholic epicedion of the virtues of waning paganism, and so it is not, I think, as completely objective as an historian is supposed to be.

In this book, the charachters are here, there and everywhere, frantically zapping back and forth in time and space,and yet the book appears to proceed in a much more sluggish(must we say squornshellous?)way. Still the book has its good moments, the Agrajag diversion, the \\"Bistromatic\\" departure, the Krikkit night, and the all too true-to-life story of \\"The Reason\\" (or the way to deceive people whit apparently sound but really senseless phrases).But trying to squeeze \\"Life, the Universe and Everything\\" in a single novel has not resulted in a very coherent  story. The effect is uneven, like in the Squornshellous episode, when the evocative description gives way to a seemingly Infinitely Prolonged linguistic tour-de force that at the end gets tiresome.

And Thorn's image is sculpted on the Pequod's prow). The better moments are the return of Lucius, Phoney and Smiley under the rain to Barrelhaven, and Ted the Bug who ironizes at Fonebone's poetry, and when moments later the Dragon to whom unwittingly Fonebone offers flowers says \\"don't you think daisies would be better for my eyes\\"? At this you'll laugh, then you'll be chilled at the Dragon's knowledge of Fone's dreams. Thus the \\"don't call me Ishmael\\"!

He is at his best when he breaks sci-fi cliches to smithereens, making you snigger or laugh wildly, yet demonstrating a deep feeling of what is the real sense of wonder of space.

The Planet Building Factory is a very original invention, and Slartibartfast is something of a Doctor Who mingled whit Obi Wan Kenobi...but lacking the self assurance of both. But the best moment of the novel is in the Story of Deep Thought and the Ultimate answer. This is pure Teather of the Absurd, and reminds us of Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan.

Sophisticately bohemien,yet down-to-earth and charming.I've loved the subtle charachterization,the athmosphere,the way Armistead Maupin contrives to treat even the most sombre passages whit a lightness and a wry humour who never fails to enchant and to move.	2002-10-03

I was disappointed by the almost cryptic shortness of the story.<BR>But,on the whole,it's an original collection, not your average erotica x meet y, they discover in two minutes they like each other, they make love there and then.

Burroughs of Cities of the Red Night. Hallucinogenic bugs, implacable militia agents, unspeakable experiments on the human form...and a city where everything is possible and nothing is permitted. Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar is cheerful in comparison to this wretched town in a wretched planet where unnamable horrors made by a \\"Justice\\" reminiscent of Dr. Mengele acts out ghastly retributions on the very body structure of the condemned personae.<BR>On the other hand China Mieville's fascinating writing intrigues us whit a description of a world uncannily unlike (and far worse) than our own. A most original masterpiece.<BR>However...well,one can't but notice some aspects that makes one wonder. How can a monster like \\"Motley\\" manage to live? His description remembers me of some Lovecraftian creature, like Yog-Sothoth or Shub-Niggurath. Yet this monster behaves like the Joker in the Batman movie..and, excuse me, China Mieville, but the idea of an insect body on a human one is entirely unplausible. More to the point, any sensible person would have destroyed a grub who feeds on drugs and doubles its size overnight! I can't believe a moth who feeds on ethereal substance,yet needs a solid milk to grow.I resent the way poor Lin is treated,by the way. I can but  think China Mieville is nothing but a mysogynist and a sexophobe of the worst kind, and a sadist to boot.	2002-09-22

Many scenes are immersed in an onirical atmosphere, and the realism whit wich the decaying bohemien neighborhood is descripted makes them even so bizarre. The story, per se, is very linear: Jeremy's obsession for the mysterious Milena, fascinating Dark Lady,and their rather discontinuous relationship. But that's only the canvas for a narrative witty, intelligent,full of intriguing satirical notations,while the story unravels the mystery of Milena's identity. Very nice the invention of the eccentric &quot;uncle&quot; Gerald and his whimsical bibliomancy. This is a book to enjoy,subtly disquieting and funny at the same time.

This book was written in a time when one could still be deemed responsible of his or her errors: see the crucial passage when the protagonist thinks he's got away whit adultery...and he discovers he did not.

The satire and the mystery intertwine in a delicious manner,so that the clues to the reader (there are some) are almost undetectable. The charachters are plausible, the interplay sometimes wildly funny. I've loved it, especially the trick of adding a further touch of uncertainty, by letting you guess who the victim shall be. The end is pure Nero Wolfe and Hercule Poirot: the suspects re-united,and the detective who having summarised the case, absolves the innocents and culminate pointing the index finger to the culprit. All in the modern showbiz multimedial setting. That's also a social satire from a conservative point of view, and some point Ben Elton makes are worth consideration. What can I say more? Dead Famous has to be read to be believed.	2002-07-04

Following it, a more plausible, politically conscious version of &quot;the Beach&quot; (if you care to compare two very different novels). Then, you have a series  of &quot;revelations&quot; and &quot;twists of the tale&quot; that leaves the reader baffled, incredulous, doubting of being put-on. Really,there's a limit to the suspension of incredulity... and credulity. You feel admired by the writer's ability to startle. Then the book wawers on, the  plot and the gist lost in dubious speculations and improbable settings. Conclusion: a good enough first novel, but there's plenty of room for improvement.	2002-06-19

But Storm's not your ordinary anticlericalist, religion is people's drug and all that. There's something in religion that attains at the very center of human nature,and this book, apparently cutting religion to pieces,recognizes it. The strange metamorphosis of Resenance Jeopardy is very intriguing. The vibrancers are an eerie fantasy indeed, but think of the castrati in Eighteenth Century  popish courts and you can find the possible source of the idea. What is most notable is the ability of Storm Constantine to devise unacanny yet convincing universes.This one is pervaded by a subtle perversion, by a purple feeling of Borgian decadence, blended whit a strange spiritual mix-up...or mishap.

Hobbits are innocent,bold,yet vulnerable to temptation.They can be noble like Frodo,faithful and loving like Sam,amiable amd cheerful like Merry or Pippin..or pettily greedy like Lobelia,or miserably loathsome like Gollum.In fact,hobbits are the average man. Wizards like Gandalf and Saruman are the men of power,who must also fight the tempation of evil.Gandalf has fought  and conquered it, Saruman has been overwhwlmed  by power lust, falseness and deception. Then you have Elves: disillusioned idealists who've chosen to fly,to evade.And so we have the psychopaths Orcs,spiteful of all that's human (they remind me of some...), the Ents,representing the Earth (Wizard are Fire, Eagles are Air, Elves are Water)as well as the industrious Dwarves. And the Evil itself,Sauron,is not personified,because it is an abstract principle,and the battle between good and evil takes place (as I've said)in the human heart. So much for the symbolic.

Jim Grimsley results in <BR>doing so are uneven. Great athmosphere, some beautiful evocative scenes (like Jessex in the abandoned city), but on too many places the reader feels like he's swimming in molasses.The general background isn't very clear,and one has to go to the appendix to see which is which.And the premise itself of the story isn't much plausible,on my opinion,even for a fantasy world. But what really annoyed me were the absurdly unsightly uneuphonious names the author chose for places and things: Shenesoeniis, Chalianthrothe, Gnemorra, Curaeth Curaesyn, to name some. Their quoyness (see Douglas Adams' Meaning of Liff) is another, if marginal, flaw of the book. O Elbereth Gilthoniel!	2001-10-16

This is the question at the end of Foundation and Earth. A novel that is definitely not Asimov's best.A recyclyng of his favourite ideas,and a preposterous ending,very little like Robots of  Dawn,Foundation's Edge and The Naked Sun.Still a wonderful read,but too  long,a lukewarm Asimov.I think that when Trevize says that he would retire  and forget the Foundations,he is externating Asimov's tiredness on the  series.Maybe Peter F.Hamilton's Edenists would make a good compromise ?  (read the novel to know what I mean)	1999-11-05

Hamilton not only dares treat the  Afterlife theme,but does it in an original and profound way.The richness of  this trilogy,the imagery,all is absolutely superb.Who could ever forget  Joshua,Louise,Ione,Syrinx and the dreadful Quinn Dexter,to name only a few  of the marvelous persona in this trilogy?	1999-10-26

US	51060163	R1J5DD8YNHSTXD	0670883565	555286470	The Spell	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A  Good  Spell	A minor carachter in the book says that for the subject of the spell it's not easy to know if it's a good or a bad spell. But whit this book I had no doubt.You're brought in close intimacy whit four intriguing,almost  Pinteresque carachters,and their interlacing desires,motives and often  frustrated longings.I loved Alex:the victim of a sex-system that makes  intelligence and thoughtfoulness for others a disadvantage versus  selfishness and ability to play whit the partner's feelings.A warm feeling  of shared understanding of human failings and human longing for love :this  is what i've felt reading this wonderful book.	1999-09-22
