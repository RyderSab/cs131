At first it was just a tad difficult for me to follow the adventures of each of the four girls in this cool book, hence the four stars instead of five. The point of view shifts a little too quickly in the beginning, but you'll more than likely get used to it. If you are looking for one of those novels that digs deep into the heart and soul of its main character(s), then \\"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\\" isn't for you.<br />But if you are looking for a fun read that celebrates friendship and the things females go through as teenage girls, then you've picked up the right book!<br />It was quite exciting to follow the girls on their separate adventures. It was like having four distinct stories all rolled into this one quick read. It makes me look forward to reading Part Two already. :)	2003-04-19

Well sure it's classified as a Young Adult novel, but that shouldn't stop older readers always on the lookout for a great read from enjoying this tasty little morsel.<br />And speaking of food, this particular volume in the series could be a great read for adolescent girls looking into starving themselves. I could go on and on and say it's not worth it to shun food to get thin, and there are other (HEALTHIER) ways to drop a few pounds, and that's even only when your weight potentially endangers your health. But that would flat-out be preachy. Fiction, if used in a constructive way, is a better way to get the message across. It's an entertaining means of getting through to the subconscious after all.<br />And that is just what this little volume can do for young girls.	2003-04-12
US	37819295	RO2YNI8GO65FQ	0446530190	572765436	Cancer Schmancer	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Enjoyable Autobiography	Fran Drescher's fans will surely love this book about her battle with cancer. Those of us used to seeing her as the funny and almost always upbeat Nanny, Fran Fine, on her hit TV show see real-life Fran in a different light. Just like all of us she's very human, with ups as well as downs, but she doesn't try to take our sympathy for herself. She's a very real person (albeit a pretty one who's always looked young for her age), and this second outing of hers as an author is also rather educational about cancer.<br />Fran doesn't go into all the technical details of what battling the disease is like, but she does warn and give advice to women experiencing similar symptoms. They just might save your life. Take it from Fran--she'd been misdiagnosed (or undiagnosed, as the case may be) several times before she could finally be treated.<br />Other events during this time of Fran's life are also shared with readers. Especially touching (particularly for animal or pet lovers) is the section about Chester, Fran's dog who starred in The Nanny. Although this book is good overall, women will probably generally appreciate it more than men, as it is about a form of cancer that attacks parts of female anatomy.	2003-04-11

All most readers have to do to appreciate it is to keep an open mind, as the well-loved monarch is portrayed in a less-than-flattering light here. New twists on the story are also liberally sprinkled in along the way, to the possible dismay of those who want to read about the heroic David of the Bible. Significant events as we know them from the traditional tale remain the same. What gives this novel such a spin are the goings-on behind the scenes, where King Saul's daughter Michal appears to have the upper hand.<br />Readers who hold more conservative views might prefer to skip this one, unless they remember it is but a fictionalized account, but more radical thinkers open to anything have nothing to lose by giving QUEENMAKER a try.	2003-04-11

In PRINCESS IN THE SPOTLIGHT Mia's adventures continue, but we have more of the same snideness and wittiness typical of America's Royal (as Mia is known). She's really funny, and not your typical princess that it's quite a bit of fun to stay tuned to the unfolding story of her life.<br />I didn't quite like the turn of events at the end, but hey, that's what Book Number Three is for.	2003-04-01

Especially now that there are four angry freshly-dead teens whose ghosts want revenge over their untimely deaths. But how'd those ghosts get to be dead in the first place?<br />If you enjoyed the first two mediator books, you'll probably love this one too. It kinda reads like a teen mystery. It's not all that difficult for older readers to figure everything out, but this is still a nice, fun read.	2003-03-21

I love Jenny Carroll (aka Meg Cabot), and this second book in her Mediator series was just as entertaining for me as the first one. Our tough but beloved lead character Suze Simon continues her paranormal adventures, but winds up kicking human, rather than ghost, butt in this installment. Oh, there are still ghosts in NINTH KEY all right (they're what this series is all about after all), but some twists end up pitting Suze against a particularly mean real LIVE human this time around.<br />There was just something I noticed in this little volume that made me wonder about inconsistencies in series such as this. If we take a close look at the name of one of the characters in SHADOWLAND, we see that it's spelled Bryce M-A-R-T-I-N-S-O-N. In NINTH KEY that same character's name is spelled M-A-R-T-I-N-S-E-N, almost as if someone else wrote it. It's just a minor detail, and we shouldn't let it detract our attention from the enjoyable tale in this book's pages. I just couldn't help but wonder about it, especially since there are other inconsistencies in books three and four.<br />Still, this second Mediator book is definitely a fun read. Check it out if you enjoyed the first one.	2003-03-21

SHADOWLAND, for me, is definitely one of those books. Protagonist Sussanah Simon is young, at sixteen, but smart and tough so it's fun seeing things from her point of view.<br />Especially since her experiences are different from those of a regular, average teen. The ghosts and paranormal events are a cool touch for readers who are either going through the same things in their own lives or just looking for a fun read.<br />I recommend this book to the fun-loving, young (and young at heart) folks who enjoy reading about psychic phenomena and things usually considered out of this world.	2003-03-17

Not everybody is fated to lead a colorful life like the one mother and daughter Vivi and Sidda share. But their story perfectly illustrates how time can heal all wounds if we let it, and how love truly prevails over even the most painful of obstacles.<br />Although author Rebecca Wells' book LITTLE ALTARS EVERYWHERE (with the same cast of characters) can stand alone, it somehow seems incomplete or unfinished once you read this one. DIVINE SECRETS... completes the picture. I recommend that if you read one, read the other as well.	2003-03-14

There's a lot of talk about witches and beastly dragons, although the actual action is nothing so medieval-sounding.<br />At times I found myself feeling a little sheepish about the events in the novel, like, &quot;I can't believe I'm falling for this!&quot; because at times the story felt unbelievable. It was as if everything fell into place a little too conveniently without much of an explanation. The concepts explored are pretty interesting though, like the power some people have to call the dead back.<br />I still think Orson Scott Card a good writer.	2003-03-12

Also, if you've been reading metaphysical books for a while, you might find that you already know about a great deal of the stuff in here.

It's something of an eye-opener for those who aren't child care professionals. For me it wasn't exactly the most gripping or powerful book I've ever read--hence the three instead of five stars--but it's still good.

I've always been fascinated by the spirit world and am myself trying to come to grips with how the soul abilities I have can be used to help others, like Edward does. Enter books like this, which I turn to in hopes of better understanding myself.<br />Just for the message and intent behind WHAT IF GOD WERE THE SUN? I give it three stars. Those alone make this little volume a pretty inspiring one. I think, though, that it could have been better written so it could be a more gripping and, thus, affecting read, especially for those whose interest in such matters could use a little perking up.<br />Technically of course there's nothing wrong with how the book was written. It's really more the &quot;showing&quot; instead of &quot;telling&quot; thing (that understandably plagues a lot of writers) that it could benefit from. <br />But kudos to you John Edward for your work in the field.

I admire John Edward for telling his story despite the detractors all psychics have, and I look forward to reading more of his adventures in the metaphysical field.<br />I have only one problem regarding this book that made me give it 3 stars instead of 5. The time frame jumps around quite a bit, that it's difficult to follow what's going on sometimes. It's, like, &quot;Where are we now?&quot; or &quot;Weren't we just talking about something else a moment ago?&quot; The transitions aren't so seamless.<br />But as to the content of CROSSING OVER, it's not at all difficult to believe in a guy who talks to the dead.

Those same circumstances kept me reading until the revelations popped up one by one. And it was worth it to stick with the novel 'til the very end!<br />As for the 4 stars instead of five in my rating of this story, I only gave it that much because it's quite unlike THE MISTS OF AVALON (which I REALLY, REALLY loved!) by the same author.

That very well may be the reason I liked this novel more than any in The Guenevere Trilogy. After all, many brilliant versions of Guenevere's story have been written (and author Miles' wasn't by far the one I enjoyed the most), but I felt with Isolde that I was seeing her world for the first time. Looking forward to what would happen next kept me a little more on my toes with the first of the Tristan and Isolde novels.<br />If I weren't such a sucker for a beautiful tale, I would have put this tome down without finishing it (same goes for the Guenevere books by the same author), as it reads more like a romance--which I am not exactly fond of--than a serious literary novel with a love story worked in. But hey, overall, this is still enjoyable fare, and I'd like to give credit where it is due.<br />This book has pretty much the same feel to it as any of all three Guenevere novels, but I enjoyed it more for the anticipation of what happens next. Even though I know the ending of the traditional tale, this story was fresh enough for me to devour ISOLDE Queen of the Western Isle in only two days. Read it if you love Arthurian romances.	2003-02-14

I found ONLY LOVE IS REAL's story of Elizabeth and Pedro to be fascinating. It did not excite me as much as I hoped it would though. It's all in the presentation. I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat and could very well have put the book down if it weren't such a quick read.<br />Nevertheless, pick up a copy if you are into reincarnation. While you're at it, you might also want to check out Dr. Bruce Goldberg's PAST LIVES, FUTURE LIVES. In this more enthralling book is a case very, very similar to (yet MARKEDLY different from) Weiss's Pedro and Elizabeth.	2003-02-12

Not that I didn't like it. It just didn't hold me in its grip like Marion Zimmer Bradley's THE MISTS OF AVALON, I guess, which is another retelling of King Arthur's story. <br />By the time I was finished with Knight of the Sacred Lake (Book Two), I had grown too attached to Rosalind Miles's characters for me to just forget about them. That in itself shows that the characters have been pretty much well developed. What I didn't like so much, I think, is the unsympathetic way so many characters are portrayed. Sure, they're interesting, but maybe I was looking for more than just Guenevere and Lancelot to think kindly of as I read the entire series.<br />If you love anything about King Arthur's court though, there's no reason you shouldn't read this. I give author Rosalind Miles credit for nevertheless producing a story with an interesting turn of events.	2003-02-11

As I've come to expect when reading anthologies, not every story in this volume of adult fairy tales is to my liking.<br />However, all in all the book has a sharp feel to it, with so many stories that have great potential and quite a few that I loved just as they are. I especially liked:<br />THE PRINCESS IN THE TOWER: amusing and light; and<BR>A SOUND, LIKE ANGELS SINGING: read it to see what it's all about--if I were to tell you, I'd spoil the story<br />Even if this collection of fairy tales retold isn't the best on the market, it's still great fun! Read it if you are a fan of dark fairy tales.	2003-02-11

It's well-written, meticulously looked into by Marion Zimmer Bradley to give it an authentic feel, and an easy read.<br />But if, like me, you're looking for lots of magic, then Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon will probably be a bit better suited to your taste. (It also portrayed more three-dimensional characters, in my opinion.) <br />The Firebrand has more of a historical feel in the way it's told as compared to the Otherworldliness of Mists. But it's certainly good, too.	2003-02-10

But oh, it could have been so much better!<br />I really, REALLY, wanted to like this book, and I do, but there is still so much potential waiting to be further developed in its pages. I feel like I could have gotten to know Winnie Rudge better; I find her quite fascinating and want to penetrate even deeper into the story of her life, that's why I was left hanging by the time I got to the novel's end. I really want to know what happens between her and John after everything. And what was the impact of the entire haunting on her?<br />I don't know. Maybe author Gregory Maguire wants to give us readers the impression that Winnie doesn't care much to deliberate over such things that's why not a whole lot happens after all that haunting business. <br />I wish a more absorbing sequel (for all its merits this one drags) were written.<br />Read it if only for its promising plot and characters.	2003-02-03
US	37819295	R1RUO23B249BI9	0609808028	21227651	The Knight of the Sacred Lake (The Guenevere Novels Number 2)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Gives the characters time to grow on you	I rate the first book in the Guenevere series 3 1/2 stars. This second one leans towards 3 3/4 stars. It's not quite a 4, but it's a bit better than GUENEVERE Queen of the Summer Country, because it's more suspenseful somehow. It was rather good. The only thing that I felt bogged this book down was the repetition. In the early chapters especially, we read about a lot of things that we already know from Book One. <br />In fairness though, I really liked the way author Rosalind Miles handled the story so that I anticipated what was going to happen next, even though King Arthur's tale is already widely known. As the reader, you find yourself excited at the unfolding of little events, like how Guenevere gets out of her trial, etc. It's not the &quot;if&quot; really, because those familiar with this same story as told in other books already know the answer to that. Reading Miles' take on the legend makes us want to know the details of her version of the story.<br />If you were enthralled by the first book in this series, read this second one. I myself am almost halfway through the third!	2003-01-18

It's a cinch to follow the events of the book, especially if you have prior knowledge of the life and times of King Arthur. It was just all right; I actually give it 3 1/2 stars.<br />I just choose not to give it a five-star review despite its redeeming qualities because, although Rosalind Miles gives the old legend a different spin, there still wasn't much to make me feel that this was more than a recycled story. It also felt like the characters are a safe distance away from the reader, like we can't get inside their heads and really sympathize with them. And how could we, when very few of them (and these are the characters who don't play a huge role in the novel) are portrayed as likable?<br />In my opinion, if you want a really fresh--and CLEARER--take on this tale, THE MISTS OF AVALON by Marion Zimmer Bradley is the book for you.<br />But if you've a keen interest in anything Arthurian, then this first installment in the Guenevere trilogy is an okay read.	2003-01-14

And I don't want to change anyone's opinion about it (you may like it, you may not), but in this review I'd just like to share my personal experience with this book with readers who are looking into buying a copy or borrowing one from the library.<br />Technically, THE CELESTINE PROPHECY may not be the best-written book ever. There have been many comments from disgruntled readers regarding the way author James Redfield wrote this book. In my case being a picky reader has not affected my reading experience when it came to this book. The novel (sometimes dubbed a \\"spiritual parable\\") is written using language that's quite simple and easy to follow. Maybe other readers wanted something a little more \\"grown-up\\" or \\"mature\\" in terms of the writing style, but the simplistic way that this was written worked very well for me. There are a lot of spiritual principles in THE CELESTINE PROPHECY that might be difficult to understand if they weren't explained as simply as they were.<br />And those spiritual principles--outdated though they might be for the advanced student of metaphysics--could be very inspiring for someone new to exploring their spirituality, or someone terribly down in the dumps. In my experience, reading this book in my college years (around 5 years ago) certainly helped me see beyond our physical world so that I could better understand the purpose of my life and not get stuck thinking negatively.<br />I'd like to share, too, that while I was reading the book, whatever spiritual principle was being discussed, I was experiencing acutely in my life. I got to see CLEARLY the energy around plants, and it was also at this time that I began to see the auric field surrounding humans.<br />For those only beginning to explore the spiritual world, you might want to give this book a try. I recommend it to you with love. :)	2003-01-14

Sure, it's not exactly an in-depth one on the oft-repeated tale of \\"the once and future king,\\" and it doesn't even really tell us much about his life and times, but it's a nice one to pique the curiosity of young readers.<br />A good, fun start for kids interested in King Arthur.	2003-01-11

She experienced so many things that most people don't usually go through at her young age. But it sure was an amazing, and well-written, journey. It is not at all difficult to get pulled into the narrative of this teenage heroine.<br />Overall, White Oleander is a very entertaining read and I would've given it five stars. The only thing that felt a little out of balance to me was the ending. Although it is a nice one that helps readers breathe easy after all the events in the book, I felt like all the excitement at the beginning of the book vanished just like that 3/4 of the way, leaving me a little high and dry. But maybe that was the point, to have Astrid settle into a life so unlike what she had at first, that the dissipation of excitement is really just a device to get that point across.<br />I recommend this book for a mix of intellectual and emotional reading.	2003-01-10

For me it's better than 3, and almost a 4, but just a hair short.<br />Granted the goings-on in society today, this tale of a missing, murdered girl is a very relevant one. It can help us explore the possibilities behind such events, seeing the situation from several angles, including what goes on in the killer's world, and how friends and family cope behind closed doors.<br />I found it quite a nice concept to write the story this way. It is not in any way a whodunit, and even has a spiritual, New Age-ish feel. I just don't know why I had certain expectations of the novel that led me to give it less than 5 stars. It's really a rather interesting book, but maybe because I knew it involved crime, I thought it was going to be a very &quot;grounded&quot; read. Sure, Susie's already in heaven when the story begins, and that alone is a very ethereal thing for those of us still on Earth, but I really continued to think that that would be the only distinctly spiritual thing about it. But then, the novel reaches its climax and that's where it turns New Age-ish, like I descibed earlier.<br />Being into psychic and metaphysical matters myself, I love stories with such themes. But in this case, just because Susie's in heaven yet manages to tell us her story doesn't mean I was prepared for the very surreal ending of this book! It was fun to read, but I'll admit... I was thrown a little off track by what happens in the end, like the story was heading in a certain direction, but then we find ourselves somewhere else entirely. Read it to see for yourself.<br />Entertaining and eye-opening.	2003-01-10

There were just so many sweet things Landon did for Jamie, it was enough to make me cry. You could say I developed an attachment to everything about A Walk To Remember.<br />Now about the book, it was pretty different from the movie, but it basically has the same gist. Still enough to make me cry. :)	2003-01-09

Okay, I'll admit, when I first began reading this book, I was starting to feel a little negative and I wanted to stop. I'd just grown so tired of reading about extremely dysfunctional people all the time that I wanted to feel inspired for a change. But then, what do you know... The novel and its characters just drew me in.<br />It's true that the themes of this book are a little on the serious side, but you can't help but feel like you know the characters that you just want to keep on reading to see their story unfold. It's that kind of book.<br />And because you just get so involved, it's likely you'll turn back to the first few pages the moment you're through just to check up on things you might've missed the first time around.<br />That's how attached you'll be to the characters by the time you reach the last page. You almost hate for it to end.	2003-01-09

Because this collection of stories has gotten great reviews here, I was really excited to begin reading.<br />     Well, it did appeal to the dreamer in me; I appreciated the way Block plays with words to weave some sort of gauzy web around us readers.<br />     However, I also felt like the book painted too vague a picture. It was a bit too dreamy to read, and then understand exactly what was going on in each story. We are left sometimes with just a wisp of an idea of what the stories are trying to get at.<br />     It wasn't all that bad, though. The concept of re-telling much-loved fairy tales is interesting, and younger readers (older teens, that is) would probably appreciate this volume more than the \\"grown-up\\" crowd.	2003-01-09

Based on other reviews written about this young adult novel, one might think of it as surprisingly graphic for readers as young as 13 years old. Upon reading it for oneself though, it is noticeable that, at least until the central character (Barbie Marks) turns 16, descriptions are very mild so as only to give us an idea of what is really going on. Yet, it seems that this slender volume, sitting on young adult shelves, gets caught in an identity crisis, its main themes being sex, drugs, molestation, and family issues, matters not taken lightly by the more conservative in our society as well as not generally thought suitable for children. What is here meant by identity crisis is that Francesca Lia Block gives us a tale that could be societally relevant if it were not wanting more description, more elaboration, and more exploration. The novel is caught between being classified as young adult fiction and something else. That something we cannot say until it is written in more, uninhibited, detail. Then it wouldn't be a children's book anymore, but it could perhaps be a more powerful story with greater impact, more than just a quick glimpse into the shadow side of life.	2002-02-02

We get more than just the usual peek at the characters, especially the women, than is usual in Arthurian novels; Marion Zimmer Bradley, through writing that gives the impression of being well researched, bares the psyches of her characters to us, giving compassion and kindness to even those considered villainous (Mordred and Morgause), and a hardness typical of being very human to some usually admired (Guinevere/Gwenhwyfar).<BR>     The only thing here that could possibly dismay close followers of Arthurian stories is the lack of the Merlin's immense participation all throughout. For although we are told that he is present at the important events in society, not much is gleaned about what he is really like on the inside, as he is uncharacteristically written about more casually than some other protagonists of the story. However, maybe this is the tale that diminishes the Merlin's role so that readers could more substantially know about the others. After all, there have been other books written about the Merlin, as well as of the escapades of the Knights of the Round Table. The Mists of Avalon takes but a different approach to the oft-repeated yarn, albeit one that is a uniquely sensitive and very three-dimensional retelling. It is a beautiful book.	2002-02-02

It's a love story, with the typical formula (despite being based, so is said, on the true-to-life story of Sparks' wife's grandparents) of boy meets girl; they fall in love, then must overcome whatever obstacles stand in their way. Not to say it isn't a good read-it's just a light, relaxing one for the times we're too tired for the mental gymnastics that more often than not accompany the experience of reading meatier tomes.	2002-02-02
