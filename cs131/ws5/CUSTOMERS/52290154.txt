A Stay Against Confusion was particularly meaningful to me.  Then he writes one of the funniest novels I've read in a long time.  Truly you will laugh out loud as others have said.<br />The people in this novel are true stock characters and yet they seem real; the reader will want everyone to be happy at the end of all the comedy.<br />I really don't want a movie made of this: the descriptions suffice.  What a talent is Professor Hansen!	2003-08-10

I'll probably go back and read the first book but I didn't feel I'd missed anything. <BR>Anton is dying of pancreatic cancer and his life flashes before  him and before his wives and children. <BR>The various voices in the novel were sometimes confusing at first but they  lent themselves to a real picture of Anton and his life and death.<BR>I found the religious thoughts of Anton fascinating and I also found him disgusting much of the time. Family relationships are always difficult and McPhee writes of each member well.<BR>There were many lies in this story and we don't always know who is telling the truth.  We do get a good picture of a man's life and how control can be lost or won.	2003-03-06

Edgar Drake is carefully drawn to show the introverted English piano tuner who changes as he is compelled to travel in the East.  His journey changes him and forces him to leave his old life (and wife) behind.  The lotus eaters of India entice him but we understand them as we read.<BR>I didn't mind the ending because it had been foreshadowed after one of Edgar's letters.<BR>I hope Daniel Mason writes more books.	2003-02-24

I use it every morning and have for years.  It's one of the best I've found to use year after year.

I work with young teenagers who are pregnant and everything here rings so true.  Elvia has the language and the thoughts of many real-life girls.  Serafina also seems very real with the immigration policies and farmworker issues of our times. I liked the way Susan Straight wove the stories of mother and daughter and their search for each other together.  A highwire moon balanced on the utility line and this novel was so balanced for me.	2002-12-31

How it won the award is beyond me.  I didn't even finish it because the third story with the young girl( I don't even remember her name) wasn't compelling.  I didn't find the writing as good as many other reviewers did.  And much that happened seemed improbable.  With so many great novels being written I hope we can award the very best.	2002-12-31

I cried when I first heard it and I cry reading it.  The whole world needs to know of the openness of many churches.<BR>It is not an easy job to pastor especially in the small, rural church.  Michael Lindvall expresses some of the doubts and triumphs that a minister feels.	2002-12-24

She just must have struck a chord with the varied voices of the generations of women (and even the men).<BR>  Other reviewers have criticized the use of poor grammar but many people DO talk that way. I thought that kind of talk made the characters all the more real. And women through the generations use the same kind of speech unless they leave the environment.<BR>I really liked the faith shared by Marvella; her dying was poignant.Life continued on to the next Moon woman.<BR>I look forward to the next Duncan novel.	2002-10-15

I didn't feel as if eastern Washington was well described and I've been there many times.  Florence I don't know about but I didn't get a sense of the city or the people there.<BR>I did read to the end which had me give the book a 3.

I never would have gone beyond the first chapter otherwise.  The descriptions of the land are nicely done but I really didn't feel anything for the characters.

Rose I found interesting, and not unlike a friend who has lost a son.  Her breaking out of grief  happened too quickly to be believed.<BR>Opal (how is that a better name than Raylee?) was not very likeable but very similar to the teenage mothers who I work with.  We may be shocked at their language and immaturity but they are fierce, loving mothers.  Anne LeClare has written an important book that is a page-turner.	2002-02-18

The other novel that I'd done this with was On the Road with the Archangel by Frederick Buechner.  I'd suggest that to readers also.  Miss Julia's Angel was well written but not nearly as well done as Possession which several reviewers have compared it to. I found some of the parts about Tobe and Sarah to be confusing and not much in line with the Aprocrophal book. And their wedding really didn't make sense to me. I read the novel in one day so I really did enjoy it.	2002-02-18

This book had some wonderful language but it was uneven.  Maybe it could have been published as some short stories and not added onto to make a novel.  The stories of bodies coming home from the Korean War and the playing of Taps was sorrowful, although I can't imagine that that many young men from one area would have died.  <BR>I could not figure out Georgia's character at all.  I was in high school during the 1950s and we didn't have anyone who acted like her.  Of course we only see her though Swayze's eyes.  I also didn't understand the final violent scene but it didn't disturb me so I guess the character of Luke had not been well drawn either.<BR>There is some beautiful language in TAPS.  I wish it all would have been beautiful.	2002-01-02

He writes words that I could only think in my heart.  This volume from the United Methodist Upper Room is filled with pictures of their Nativity creche collection.

We need affordable housing and a liveable wage for all. Ehrenreich makes the case for this by recounting her stories. I hope people who never see the working poor can read this book and take some actions to assist.<BR>I didn't give 5 stars because I disagreed with the personal biases against religion and for smoking that the author espouses.<BR>I was dismayed that BE went to a a tent meeting and then used that experience to show what religion does. My church works on justice issues; right now we subsidise a family of a mother and 4 children by providing housing. Jesus can be called a socialist and many people I know feel called to work to help the poor.<BR>I teach teenagers and I'm glad that there is drug testing. Many young people are addicted and that limits their choices and starts them on a downward spiral. I learn much from the young people about the culture of poverty and I've worked in it when I was younger but I still don't know how to change our system except as I relate one on one with each student. Read the book for an interesting view of life in the US but be aware that the problems of poverty are not simple.	2001-09-03

I'm not a professional musician but I think I know enough about music to say many of the emotions described ring true.<BR>The story of getting Smokey the cat was just perfect. Anyone who loves cats will relate to the description and see how pupil and teacher and pupil again come full circle.<BR>As for the many reviewers who feel Buddhism was misrepresented, I think that Salzman was describing much more than a religion. He was writing about how people view and misconstrue life events.<BR>Another Salzman novel, Lying Awake, also deals with emotion, illness and religion (this time Catholicism). His writing talent is considerable.	2001-08-30

Mr. Anastas has pictured  the small liberal church as it is.  He also brings a spirituality to the reader as the church year is followed.   Bethany( a favorite town of Jesus) was a little hard to understand but she is probably typical of the mother and wife who married too early and is looking for love.  She never comes to terms with the pastor's disappearance, but her life does change as she relates to her husband and children in new ways.	2001-06-18

Reynolds Price wrote and read about the two lines that give the title of this collection.  He cites the Latin poet, Horace and says that the English poet, A.E. Houseman translated the poem.

My book club really enjoyed BIRD OF PARADISE.  And Dennis's book about snake-handling churches was fascinating so I read this story of a marriage hoping to find kindred people.  I admire honesty but I was very disturbed by this couple and their obessions.  I'm not a prude and I've always been a Christian( even though some youthful love affairs) but I don't understand raising two daughters and continuing in the way the Covingtons have.  I also don't understand having an abortion because you can't tell who the father of the fetus is.  Again I believe that abortion is very necessary but not for the reason Vicki gave.  &quot;What kind of marriage do you have?&quot; was the question the wife of Vicki's lover asked and it's a valid question.  We all have our definitions of marriage and we all lead lives that call for forgiveness but we're also called to repentance.  I didn't see much of that in CLEAVING.  Sometimes the honesty is too much.	2001-03-10

Please, a teacher who bets at the racetrack and won't marry the woman that he gets pregnant!  I had no empathy or sympathy for him.  He was totally uninterested in his daughter also, and I just found him so unbelievable I didn't want to waste my time when I had so many other books to read.  I'm surprised at all the glowing reviews. I just have to like (at least a little bit) the major characters in a novel.  Maybe it was more easily understood by a male reader but this busy grandmother and teacher just did not get it.	2001-01-10

I've read all of Kingsolver's books and think she is wonderful.  I didn't think some of this book rung as true as her other novels.  I liked Garnett and could really relate to him, maybe because my father was a farmer, but Deanna just didn't seem real.  And how did she get pregnant with all the condoms Eddie brought with him? I hope that readers learned more of the interrelatedness of life by reading the novel.  I still like The Bean Trees or Animal Dreams much better.	2000-12-17

However, I didn't see the man who wrote &quot;The Cost of Discipleship&quot; and other theological works in her descriptions.  No one in the book is really a saint (with the possible exception of George Bell) and actually no one is a villain either.  The Nazis are evil but there wasn't much said of what we know of their villainy. I did admire the writing and research of Ms Giardina but I wish I really knew what Bonhoeffer was like.  I think he had to have more strength than was pictured here.	2000-11-23

Sayers mystery  novel, THRONES, DOMINATIONS and thought she wrote very well.  This novel is  also well-written; the characters are believable.  The situation of never  finding out who your father was is a little less believable, but as another  review states, the artist character who keeps the secret, very well, could  be the type to keep a secret to her grave. I liked the use of a real story  from the coast of England as a part of this novel.  The people of the  village were intriguing as well as the major characters.  Marion, the  protagonist, finally finds her father but more she finds herself.  She  realizes that life is what is made of it, and we are responsible for making  a happy life.  And we are more like our parents than we ever want to be.	2000-08-05

I was disturbed initially when information came out about all King's misdeeds with women.  The idea that  preachers {of all races} trade on the power they have to &quot;get&quot;  women is one I've experienced for years.  I'm so glad that Dyson points the  finger at a man who was great but had many flaws especially where women  were concerned.The book was readable but a little repetitive.	2000-07-25

I had to read Memoirs for my Book club and I say HAD because I'm sure I wouldn't've finished it otherwise.  I just didn't find it beautifully written as others  did; I guess I read too many really well written novels.  The rivalry of  women in Japan was hard to read about as was the control of the men.

It was a pleasure to read Mr. Macfarlane's story of a man's thoughts and  memories of childhood though adulthood.  I liked the way all the thoughts  blended together across the years as thoughts do in our minds as we  reminisce.  The forced Sunday School experiences recalled my childhood  times for me.  I've stayed a little closer to religious practice than Bay  in the novel but I felt Bay was still a man of faith.   Many descriptions   in the novel are extremely hope-filled.  The characters are all well-drawn  and believable.  It is just wonderful to read a novel of this caliber, so  much writing today is not even worth reading. Summergone, mentioned only  once in a list of other flowers, is a wildflower found in Canada. The  author doesn't try to imply any heavy-handed symbolism but leaves any  connections to be made by the reader.  I really liked the economy of  Macfarlane's prose in a book that any sensitive reader should love.	2000-07-09

She's a better writer than this.  Every person and situation seemed so contrived.  Much of the dialog was excellent and sounded like real people talking, but the  situations didn't ring true.  Why would a doctor even meet and marry  Miriam?  Even the ending was awfully improbable.  I've directed a summer  camp and there would be no way a stranger could walk around the way Ronnee  did.

These thoughts do resonate with me to a certain extent, but I found many of these thoughts to be self-absorbed.  I just can't imagine a daughter driving all over at the news of her mother's  death.

My love of reading  is my life, and many of my favorite books are  ones by Larry McMurtry.  He can describe people better than most other  authors.

I'm surprised that this short novel got such glowing reviews from other customers.  I found the story very hard to believe (the girl fathered by Jeru's dad just happening to be in his class in school? ).  The voice was  good in the novel but I just read as quickly as possible to get through the  book.	1999-12-06

Alice Mattison weaves tales of wonderful women in various periods of American life.  I loved the way the  reader could remember a fact that the character had forgotten.   Toby Ruben  got herself out of the grief of  losing Deborah by talking to her.  The  final scene with the book being placed in Jeremiah's screen door is just  right. I plan to read more by Mattison.	1999-11-08

I found much of the story improbable but I was still fascinated with the evolution of Jane which was her realization that Martha  had not seen events in their early life in the same way.  The combination  of Darwin's theories and life was interesting to me also but probably many  readers just want a story line.  I may suggest this book to my book club; I  think it will be a good one to discuss.	1999-08-30

I found myself saying yes and even remembering pictures of my family  that are so similar.  This was a wonderful memoir that I could really  connect to.  Nancy Drew and Little Women (although the movie sadly  disappointed me) and popular music before rock and roll were all a part of  my life. Life in the country seems to be the same all over our United  States. I've loved Mason's novels and I can see why now with her life so  displayed for us.	1999-06-28

I thought Weight of Water, although it had a terrible ending was intriguing with the two    stories  told.  Eden Close, an earlier novel, was a memorable   story of a  girl and young man.  I   didn't connect to any of the characters in Pilot's  Wife and I was disappointed that Oprah chose this novel when Shreve's  others have been so mcuh better.	1999-05-06

She's had so many setbacks and she's realized that the Holy Parent is there for her.  Sam, her son sounds like a great little boy and how could he help but be with  how he's been raised. St. Andrew Presbyterian is a model for all the rest  of us who struggle with our denomination and see glimpses of what we can  be. I will read more of Ms. Lamott's work.	1999-04-06

Alice was the only voice I really could read.  When we got to Lewis I just skipped over much of his complaining and read the rest rapidly to get the gist of the plot.  The  Starbridge series was compelling and the theology interesting, so Howatch's  secular novel disappointed me.	1999-03-15

She lets a reader see the inner lives of her characters.   I loved the way Mrs. Mays longed to be someone different (an old, outrageous woman in a  black dress) but realized she had to stay as what she was.  Her boarder(not  border as in another review) actually did little to change the direction of  Dorothea's life.   I could feel how Dorothea was affected by another  presence in the home she had lived in with only the memory of her late  husband.  <br />Not one of the well-drawn characters was really able to turn  around their lives. &quot;All that was left was for them to find some  middle way, between acceptance and defeat.&quot;  Exactly.	1999-02-19

I used this book (that I purchased for our Presbyterian church library) in our adult class this morning and got wonderful response from everyone.  They loved the description of Norris's faith that was &quot;dormant for so  long&quot;.  This book will be read by many of us as we seek to live the  words of faith. The previous reviewer who cites page 15 needs to re-read  the context, I think. She didn't say that those listed were evil but that  people say that. This book is one for the faithful and those of us working  on our faith.  And with grace we grow closer to God with the wonderful  words of Kathleen Norris.	1999-02-01

Writing about reading has been done by a few, and it's always revealing.  I liked reading Fadiman's essays.  I remember  Anne's father from essays years ago; the description of her family and their word games and quotation  reciting was good to read.  At first I thought Anne was far above me in  literary content but then I read about finding typos and cleaning the dryer  lint and I really identified.  If you love to read you'll love Ex Libris.	1999-02-01
US	52290154	RK2XU7FISR25S	0060611251	892400651	On the Road with the Archangel	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Wonderful, as usual	Just because I'm an active Presbyterian I started reading Frederick Buechner, and he is a wonderful writer.  Both his novels and his non-fiction are compelling.   Reading ARCHANGEL made me go to the Apocrypha  to read the Book of Tobit, and I found Buechner's story was very close to  the book.  It's a charming tale of a boy and his dog, a father made blind  by bird droppings, and a beautiful woman who is like a princes in a fairy  tale.  I'm so glad that Rev. Buechner used his writing talents to point out  an ancient story of Hebrew tradition. This is not a book for those who have  made angels trivial. but reveals the God behind the angel.	1999-01-24

I was looking forward to another excellent book, but I was very disappointed.  I didn't connect with any of the characters and I especially didn't care for the  wartime descriptions; they didn't seem realistic.  The twins were not  characterized well; I didn't feel I knew them.   Too much time passed, too  quickly for any real feelings to develop.  I have to admit I just skimmed  the last half of the book to see what the big mystery re: the twins was.   And that was anticlimatic.  I liked the first novel so much better.  It  hardly seems to be the same author.	1999-01-18

I'm not sure where I read that it would be a good one to read, but it didn't live up to any expectations I had.  I would have quit reading after a few chapters but I did want to  re-read some of the poems.  The characters were not believable and the plot  a little silly.	1998-12-08

They are funny and meant to be.  I love the characters of Gertie and Reenie and laugh out loud at their speech.  Set in  Heraldsgate(which is a little like Seattle)some of the humor is more  obvious to those of us fortunate enough to live in the Pacific Northwest.   This book is fun to read at the holiday season.	1998-12-05

The book starts in an unrealistic mode, but gets better as Jamie, the main character, travels to the country of Erinsay, and finally  to the previous century.  This is a story of love, sacrifice, and  redemption, not unusual themes for Rev. Brown.  The beautiful song the  title is taken from is printed on the endcovers of the lovely little book.   I recommend it to all who like romance.	1998-11-17

Last summer when my daughter and I visited Victoria, British Columbia I found the book  in a bookstore for one dollar and bought it.  I read it on the ferry  traveling home and it was wonderful to read of the Maine woods and look and  see the woods of the San Juans.  A lovely set of stories, with lovely  people.  I'm so glad I got the book.	1998-11-13

I loved all her other novels but Sharp Teeth of Love contained so many memorable characters.  I  particularly liked Erica and cried when I realized she had taken Sam and  will try to raise him with love that may redeem him from the abusive past.   This book showed males at their worst and at their best.  One of the best  scenes was in the restaurant when the three men got together to arrange her  life.  Love is difficult and &quot;sharp&quot; but also selfless.	1998-11-10

Alice McDermott captures life marvelously as she uses dialog and description to depict the life of a very troubled man.  But he was nevertheless a man of faith and conviction.  The many characters simply  showed life in an extended Irish family.The ending with &quot;lives of the  saints&quot; is perfect.	1998-11-06
