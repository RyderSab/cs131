In this case, Dragonstar expands upward and outward taking your fantasy game into a high tech world of starships and blaster... in a Universe ruled by Dragons...<br />The Basic outline:<br />Chapter 1: Welcome to Dragonstar<br />This chapter is completely in color. It looks nice and features the back-story of the Empire, explaining more than enough to make a player feel right at home in the Dragonstar Universe. It explains the foundations of the Empire and how things evolved from there.<br />Chapter 2: Races<br />This covers the core races of the D&amp;D system and any changes made in light of the setting. Each one is well done and very detailed for the setting. It also adds four new PC races: Drow, Half-Dragons, Orcs, and Soulmechs.<br />Chapter 3: Classes<br />All the basic D&amp;D classes are presented and are modified to fit the Dragonstar setting. Two new classes are added, the Pilot and the Mechanist. The prestige classes from the DMG are all listed with changes and the new prestige classes of Gundancer, Negotiator, and Technomancer are presented (we can assume more are to come).<br />Chapter 4: Skills<br />A listing of changes to the Basic D&amp;D skills are given as well as new skills. Nine new skills appear.<br />Chapter 5: Feats<br />Changes to existing feats are given as well as a library of new ones. The new feats are very well done and are free of overlap. The Technical Profieciency appears in this chapter. The Technical Feat is key to seperating Primitive (read standard) D&amp;D characters from High-Tech (read Dragonstar) characters. Each class gains some benefit from this feat and the feat is free to characters who begin play with exposure to High-Tech.<br />Chapter 6: Equipment<br />This chapter covers everything you need from weapons to armor to tools to gear to robots. This section is to be expanded in the forthcoming Imperial Supply Book.<br />Chapter 7: Combat<br />Excellent chapter, the rules have not altered melee or made it obsolete, but at range, energy weapons are presented as the preferred means of combat.<br />Chapter 8: Magic<br />This chapter presents changes to magic (including such nice tidbits as spellbook software), changes to the basic D&amp;D spells and a selection of new spells, including the arcane spells for damaging/healing robots and (my favorite) Refuel.<br />Chapter 9: Vehicles<br />A sizable addition to the d20 system, Dragonstar presents a very well thought out system. The scale and speed systems are very nicely done. The new sizes (Colossal II through IV) are easy understand and follow the 3rd Edition model. As a result, starship combat is  easy to run. A short listing of vehicles and the explanation and picture of the Starcaster (the teleporting device) is also added.<br />This book has the best editing of any d20 product I've seen so far and the layout is excellent. The forthcoming Galaxy Guide should present Magic Items and (the promised) Spellware.<br />All in all... the perfect addition.to armor to tools to gear to robots.

This rule book contains all the rules you need in one place (hence the size and cost increase)... no need for a player's handbook, monster manual or Dungeon Master's Guide.<br />Presented are the myriad human cultures of the WoT presented in great and loving detail and the Ogier are also presented as a player race. Core classes for the players capture the feel of the setting and whet your appitite for the prestige classes to follow (I mean, REALLY, you didn't think you were going to START play as an Asha'man, Aes Sedai, Warder or Wolfbrother did you?).<br />Fear not, from Asha'man to Gleeman to Thief-Taker, all of the concept of the WoT series are handled with reverance for the author's design and the d20 multi-classing methodology helps to frame the character concepts well...<br />New feats (including lost arts like dream-walking) are presented along-side those from the PHB.<br />Channelling and the One source are well defined and structured and some \\"Weaves\\" are labelled \\"LOST\\" for the players (like the Heroes of the Novels) to discover (Balefire anyone?).<br />Topping off this excellent product are sections on running the game and faithful interpretations of the exotic monsters of the settings...<br />Those who want to see their favorite character's stats will NOT be disappointed as the heroes of the tale (and some of the villians) are given the star treatment...<br />Finally, and I can not express this enough, the artwork on this piece is GORGEOUS... it is a delight to the eye and fits beautifully within the framework of the book's layout (which  is also quite beautiful).<br />Fan of the WoT or not, this product is a big win for d20 system.ully within the framework of the book's layout (which  is also quite beautiful).<br />Fan of the WoT or not, this product is a big win for d20 system.	2001-11-11

Victorian Horror has always been a favorite genre of mine. When I heard that Sword and Sorcery Press would be reviving the setting for D&amp;D3E under the open gaming liscence I was very excited and S&amp;S came through...<br />Firstly, here's what's inside:<br />*Chapter One: The World of Ravenloft<br />  - How to use this Book<br />  - The Gothic mystique (outlining the history of Gothic literature)<br />  - The Realm of Dread (giving an overview of the setting)<br />  - History<br />  - Timeline of Events<br />  - Geography of Mists (contains Cultural Levels for the domains of dread)<br />  - Lexicon (terms used in the game)<br />*Chapter Two: Player Characters featuring:<br />  - Races<br />  :Humans<br />  :Calibans (twisted humans exposed to foul curses)<br />  :Dwarves<br />  :Elves<br />  :Gnomes<br />  :Half-elves<br />  :Halfings<br />  :Half-vistani (a new race)<br />  - Classes<br />  :All of the Core classes are present, with additional rules for each class<br />*Chapter Three: The Ways of the World<br />  - Fear, Horror, and Madness rules<br />*Chapter Four: The Dread Realms<br />  - Covering each Domain, giving information on Cultural level, Landscape, Major Settlements, The Folk, The Law, Trade and Diplomacy, Characters.<br />*Chapter Five: Horrors of the Night<br />  - Covering the monsters of Ravenloft.<br />  - Vampires, Ghosts, Liches, Lycanthropes, Constructs (including a new template: the Dread Golem), The Ancient Dead, Fiends, Hags, and the Vistani<br />  - Each entry is detailed much as the old Van Richten's Guides did.<br />*Chapter Six: The Ravenloft Campaign<br />  - Tips and hints on maintaining a gothic horror atmosphere.<br />  - The book ends with a list of reading and viewing materials in the genre.<br />All in all the book delivers more than enough source material to run a campaign of Gothic Horror in your D&amp;D game and plenty of material to allow for a flawless conversion of your 2nd edition Ravenloft campaign to D&amp;D3E.<br />My only REAL disappointment is the lack of statistics for the Darklords themselves. Hopfully this information will be forthcoming in another Ravenloft supplement, perhaps one that will address the variety of monsters not given.

US	50209142	R27A7DAU9ISEN	0970826532	365044254	Mystic Warriors (d20 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)	Books	3	3	6	N	N	Heretics	I wanted to LOVE Mystic Warriors, I really did. I eagerly anticipated the arrival of the product and 'oohed' and 'aahed' over the cover... but somewhere between the pages it lost some of its... well, mysticism.<br />Firstly, let us discuss what the book IS before we discuss what the book is not. Inside this 126 page soft back are:<br />* 22 Prestige Classes<br />* 1 New Race<br />* 20+ New Feats<br />* 50+ \\"Special Techniques\\"<br />* \\"Special Items\\" (think MAGIC Items)<br />* Sample Schools<br />* A Guide (albeit a small one) to help you run/incorporate Mystic Warriors (and the concepts presented) into a campaign<br />* Design rules for expanding the concepts presented.<br />Mystic Warriors begins with the premise of introducing a new, point based, magic system, for the d20 game system, called \\"Vitus\\". Vitus is, essentially, the life force that we all possess. Every character has a Vitus point total (whether a Mystic Warrior class or no). Using the Vitus system requires the use of the Harness Vitus skill. Expending these Vitus Points power the characters \\"Special Techniques\\" (essentially spell-like abilities). Expending too much Vitus has a detrimental effect on the character (as the character is, essentially, depleting their life force).<br />Despite the way it sounds, this introduction does exactly what the Open Gaming License intended; it expands and grows the d20 system. Does it do it well? That is up to you to decide.<br />The drawbacks to this book start small and (unfortunately) grow. The artwork ranges from Excellent to very poor, and that is very disappointing as it is obvious that Mystic Eye Games&#8482; has some talented artists on staff. Why they were not used in exclusion of the less polished artists is a mystery.<br />The Artwork does have a nostalgic feel, reminiscent of 1st edition dungeons and dragons and older Hero Games&#8482; products... but the nostalgia wasn't enough to make me enjoy the artistic presentation.<br />The layout of the book also lacks. The pages were full of \\"Gutters\\" where the information presented could have been condensed, making the book smaller or saving space for more designer notes.<br />The classes themselves are well designed save for the fact that the system seems to require that each class takes a series of Restrictions (examples include a weekly sacrifice of the character's most valuable material possession and never using or owning magic items.), many of these restrictions (though in many cases well conceived) ham-string the character to the point that the class would never be playable. It feels like the folks at Mystic Eye were afraid that the Classes were too powerful without these emasculating \\"Strictures\\".<br />Fortunately, there is good news. Towards the end of the book, there is a page dedicated to using the \\"Special Techniques\\" without Vitus and even rules for eliminating the \\"Special Techniques\\" altogether (though I think this is a disservice to the designers).<br />I believe that if the Strictures were eliminated (or at least toned down or balanced from class to class) and the Vitus system were set aside (except for those of you that want to expand to yet another Magic System) that the product is very playable.<br /> (...) With a few modifications it can also contribute a great deal to an existing campaign.<br />If you are looking for a flawless product then pass this one by, but if you are looking for prestige classes with an inspired background that needs a bit of mechanical overhaul, I recommend that you give Mystic Warriors a try...ges were full of \\"Gutters\\" where the information presented could have been condensed, making the book smaller or saving space for more designer notes.<br />The classes themselves are well designed save for the fact that the system seems to require that each class takes a series of Restrictions (examples include a weekly sacrifice of the character's most valuable material possession and never using or owning magic items.), many of these restrictions (though in many cases well conceived) ham-string the character to the point that the class would never be playable.

It was page after page of lists of stats for characters of each class... Boring.<br />However, in the back of the book was 10 or so pages of fully fleshed NPC's (mainly from Gary Gygax's campaign)... and that was the GEM hidden in the trash.<br />Enemies and Allies is the modern version of those last 10 pages... And it is a bit of a Gem itself.<br />Only 64 pages in length, this booklet packs quite a punch.<BR>Each section is divided by evironment (Crime, Religion, Mages, The Law and Adventurers).<br />Each chapter provides a cross-section of fully detailed characters for the Niche they have been assigned. There are unique spells and some new Feats that appear (as one might expect), additionally some of the NPCs run beyond interesting into the realm of inspired (such as the Illithid Assassin Yarrick Zan).<br />The real meat of the book is in the Two-Page \\"One-Minute NPC\\" section.<br />Finally, the \\"Iconic\\" characters from the Players Handbook are provided (Redgar, Tordek, etc.) Which is just fun.<br />Surely this is not a necessary addition to a Game Masters arsenal, but it is a happy addition for those of us that like to see how someone else thinks.	2001-10-18

There was a moment of confusion when I first began to look at the presentation... Until I realized that (because of the manner in which it was presented) this is actually two sourcebooks rolled into one.<br />First I'd like to address the few complaints I have heard. <BR>1) The Book is unecessarily Large: FALSE. The Book attempts (sucessfully) to combine a basic rules set, dungeon master information, monster manual and campaign setting in one book. It does this at a reasonable pricefor 252 pages of information... and not a page is wasted.<BR>2) The Five Rings campaign setting dominates and dilutes the value of the product: FALSE. The design of the book saved space by including campaign specific rules for races and classes directly in the rules section itself (rather than isolating them to a campaign section alone)<BR>3) The Ninja should have been a Core Class: MOOT POINT. The Ninja Spy (and apparently two other Ninja presitge classes will be appearing in the dragon) was an excellent method of expanding the basic rogue or fighter (or even monk) into the fanatsy/movie version of the Ninja myth... (If you want a TRUE historical Ninja... play a rogue/monk)<br />Now... what is inside this book?<br />*5 New Races, inclusing the Spirit Folk, Hengeyokai and Korobokuru from the original OA<BR>*5 Core Classes, including the Samurai, Shukenja and Sohei (also from the original)<BR>*Over 25 Presitige classes including a more balanced Kensai...<BR>*100 spells that fit perfectly in the setting<BR>*75 New Monsters, inclusing a wealth of asian dragons.<BR>*The Legends of the Five Rings Campaign setting which is completely modular and allows for a ready made stoyline for those DM's that just want to dive in.<br />This product allows for a variety of campaign, from a more historical Sword and Sake game all the way to a Hugely High-Fantasy &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot; style game. <br />Many of the huge number of new feats allow the for the Chambara (Hong Kong action movie) style of martial arts...<br />My only complaint is that once again, the Asian world is presented as a mismatched WHOLE, elements of Chinese and Japanese culture are thrown together in a (sometimes) unatural mixture. This complaint is not enough to lower my rating however, a good DM will do his or her research and design a campaign that includes the elements they value...<br />I would like to see an expansion of this product including concepts from malasia and korea (also seats of historic martial arts forms) and an expansion of the (very well done) exotic weapons to enclude even MORE weapons of the far east...<br />all in all... an excellent product for those interested in an Aisan campaign or for games that have monks hungering to play their Hong Kong Action Fantasies...	2001-10-13

With White Wolf Games as Publisher/Printer of their materials they stand a good chance.<br />Of all of the campaign settings to date, The Scarred Lands is easily the most imaginative, without journeying so far afield that they lose site of the core d20 rules. <br />The Scarred Lands takes the classical concept of a war in heaven and turns it on its ear. This blasted landscape of a continent and the surrounding waters is a direct result of a war between the Gods and the Titans. Gorges carved by a Titan's sword, a sea of Blood born of a wounded Titan at the bottom of the Ocean's depths... it goes on from there.<br />This setting is exactly the opposite of campaigns like the Forgotten Realms or even the venerable Greyhawk campaign. The Scarred Lands is a dangerous and dealy place, full of strange and wonderous people and things... a city of Necromancer (each and every one of them striving to be a lich), a city whose very walls are the arms of a giant mithral golem... this is NOT low fantasy... <br />So, give The Scarred Lands a try, if you are familiar with the D&amp;D Third Edition Gazetteer or the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, the formatting will be easy for you to follow. <br />Finally, SSS has stated their manifesto to be &quot;3rd Edition D&amp;D with a 1st Edition feel&quot;... with that goal in mind... I'd say they are succeeding.	2001-09-04

The strongest point for this product is the rich detail given regarding each of these institutions. <br />After reading the book twice, it is my opinion that the Churches and classes asscoiated are best suited either to NPC's as support and framework for the campaign OR for all members of the party be somehow related to the group in question.<br />Either way, Touched by the Gods is very rich and rewarding reading in a nice hardback package.	2001-07-16

WOTC has finally (it appears) to have settled on a format for these guidebooks and the layout is excellent. <br />The prestige classes range from the creative 'Acolyte of the Skin' (who willingly trades their humanity for a diabolic nature) to the Cthulhu inspired Alienist (who bargains with dark forces) to the Marvelous True Necromancer (who brings the Necromancer into their own).  The Spell oriented feats are equally well designed and provide for a variety of opportunities and variations as well as allowing casters to tailor their spells to their favored element (Fire, Ice, Sound, etc.).<br />All in all, an excellent book that is (still) unfortunately priced a bit too high.	2001-07-16

For those that are NOT familiar with the idea, WOTC has offered an 'Open Game License' to any publisher that would like to contribute to the further growth of the d20 system that has been implemented with D&amp;D3Ed.<br />Sword and Sorcery Studios is one of the leaders in the race to see who will dominate the d20 market (outside of WOTC). With White Wolf Games as Publisher/Printer of their materials they stand a good chance.<br />The Creature Collection II is the much anticipated sequel to the sometimes maligned Creature Collection. Though I really enjoyed the creativity that went into the Original CC, CC2:Dark Menagerie is by FAR a better product. The illustrations are of a much higher calibre (though still black and white) and it is obvious that the creators had a great time putting this work together. Much like the Original CC, the whole collection manages to work well and add some very nice elements to what appears to be an exciting campaign setting.<br />Unlike the Original, CC2 seems to be more geared towards the minions of the Dark Titans that once ruled the Scarred Lands. These creatures run the gamut from the Frighteningly deadly to the just plain DISGUSTING... but it all manages to work, giving the GM (whether he is using the SL campaign setting or not) a veritible army of bizzare minions to delight and confound players in his/her d20 game. By far, this is one of the most pleasing products recently released for the ever expanding d20 game system.<br />Finally, SSS has stated their manifesto to be &quot;3rd Edition D&amp;D with a 1st Edition feel&quot;... with that goal in mind... I'd say they are succeeding.	2001-07-16

I find the campaign derivative, unimaginative and self-agrandizing... but WOW...<br />This is a beautiful package (though the price is a tad high) and contains everything necessary for a beginning group that needs a canned campaign setting. The illustrations are gorgeous and the book is jam packed with excellent examples of how to construct and layout a campaign. There are numerous (easily transportable) prestige classes and dozens of excellent feats that help to convert the concept of 'Feat' into one better described as a 'merit' (to use White Wolf vernacular) or 'Edge' (to do likewise with Deadlands). <br />The only flaws are the surprising number of grammatical and spelling typos and what feels like a rushed examination of religion (which is presented as key to the campaign). I expect the latter to be addressed in the upcoming Magic of Faerun book.<br />Finally, the price is STEEP, but, surprisingly, the product is worth it for the versatility it will add to your home brewed campaign or the indespensible value it will prove to your FR campaign.	2001-07-16

This book is completely incomprehendable. The style is neither clever, nor insightful... it's just BAD. This may very well be the single worst book I have ever had the displeasure to read. <br />The saddest part of this is that, in general, I had begun to enjoy this series. Parts 4 and 8 by Kathleen Ryan rose to such heights of excellence that I had hoped (vainly) that there was finally some plot to this plodding embarrassment of a series...  Alas... it seems I was wrong.	2001-05-08

With such a poor beginning as was offered in books one and two of this (by and large) pedestrian series, I was shocked to find this jewel among the trash pile. Kathleen Ryan (whom, until now had only written lead-in pieces for White-wolf's Mage game) has tepped forward and claimed the lead-horse position in this race.<br />Setite is full of facsinating and believable characters, fantastic dialogue and cunningly described scenes. The characters are VERY human and very likable... even in their villainy.<br />A suggestion to the folks at white wolf... should you launch another new series, place Kathleen Ryan at the helm.	2001-05-08

Though not as compelling as Kathleen Ryan's prior book (Setite), the author continues to remain the powerhouse writer in this, otherwise disappointing, series. <br />Once again, Ryan's characters are believable, likable (even the villains) and cunningly REAL. She makes the World of Darkness TRULY come alive despite the poor backdrop she was given by the other books in the series which rarely rise to the heights of mediocrity.<br />Kudos to Kathleen Ryan for another example of White Wolf authors that actually know what a 'Story-teller' does.	2001-05-08

There were many directions the book could have gone, and it seemed that Justin Achilli SAW those opportunities, but never took them.<br />A clan with such a rich and unsual history as the Giovanni offer an amazing opportunity for any Author, even beyond the obvious puerile topics of Necrophillia and Incest (which seems to be the primary focus of Giovanni authors, aimed to shock and titilate.)<br />Unfortunately Achilli never uses any of the opportunities afforded him.	2001-05-08

The sad part is that Tzimisce had such potential. The Tzimisce are a facinating clan constructed of dicotomy, yet the plastic characters in this novel never stretch beyond boring. <br />When reading this book I was hoping to be at LEAST horrified, if not engaged ir interested, but Eric Griffen committed the greatest crime and author can commit, he neither made me hate him nor love him... he merely bored me.	2001-05-08

The Point based Psi-system is exactly what was needed (and not that different than the Spell-point system long proposed to replace per day spells). The text is concise and easy to read. The art beautiful to behold and the Two classes presented (Psion and Psychic Warrior) are a great launching point for the plethora of prestige classes presented.

Back in the middle 70's we found these three little white books... Melee, Blackmoor and Chainmail... who knew it would get so big?!?!<br />The latest installment of Dungeons and Dragons... wow... I had no idea. I frankly (as an old fogey and grumpy-old-codger©) I had no intention to give my money to the people that brought the world Magic: The Addiction... Boy was I wrong.<br />The 3rd edition rules keep all of the traditions and conventions of the original system and streamline them into an amazing and completely playable game. The graphics are exciting and gorgeous to look at and the prose is... not too bad really.<br />If you WERE a fan... become one again... if you are a gamer that has never experienced the Grandfather of gaming... have a look, cause th old man has been working out.	2001-04-26

For those that are NOT familiar with the idea, WOTC has offered an 'Open Game License' to any publisher that would like to contribute to the further growth of the d20 system that has been implemented with D&amp;D3Ed.<br />Sword and Sorcery Studios is one of the leaders in the race to see who will dominate the d20 market (outside of WOTC). With White Wolf Games as Publisher/Printer of their materials they stand a good chance.<br />The Creature Collection is a reasonably priced (if not as well illustrated) addition to the Monster Manual. The CC provides some incites into the Scarred Lands Campaign setting, forthcoming form SSS. The resulting creatures range from the Excellent, with the facinating Ratmen and the ridiculously HUGE Mithril Golem, to the absurd, with the idiotic Karnival Krewe.<br />This being said... the whole collection manages to work well and add some very nice elements to what appears to be an exciting campaign setting.<br />Finally, SSS has stated their manifesto to be &quot;3rd Edition D&amp;D with a 1st Edition feel&quot;... with that goal in mind... I'd say they are succeeding.	2001-04-26

Typically one would assume that the first book in a series would be used as  a hook to draw the reader into the world being presented.<br />Clan Novel  Toreador fails miserably in this respect. There is little, if any,  character development and the idea of plot seems lost on the author. The  Book never even graduated to painfully bad... at best it was boring.<br />I  will endeavor to struggle with this series in hopes that the other  'Storytellers' in this series can manage to live up to the term, though I  dread the upcoming Clan Novel Malkavian as it seems to be regurgitated by  the same 'author'.	2000-08-15
