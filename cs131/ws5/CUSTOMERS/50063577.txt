Mark Hare's \\"Watching My Friend Die: The Honest Death of Bob Schwartz\\", is a remarkable little book. Ostensibly, this is a story book of a mere 142 pages, well-told, about the lingering death from pancreatic cancer of a well-loved Rochester, NY teacher and songwriter at the tender age of 49. But it is also a story about the author's candid personal reactions to the circumstances of his friend's death and his introspective musings about death, faith, and life choices. The thoughts and questionings expressed are rightly thought by the author as more than just his own but likely to be experienced by others in similar circumstances, hence worthy of being expressed in a book. Hare's introspection results in some positive realizations for him, like the value of hope, community, and his Catholic faith. Hare is liberal enough to believe that these things may or may not be similarly valued by others, but he makes the case that one can learn a great deal about life choices from the experience of death. The book is part of a series published by ACTA Publications of reflections of lay Catholics on what it means to live out the Catholic faith in the midst of life's joys and challenges.<br /><br /> What initially fascinated the author about the death of Bob Schwartz was how Bob refused to die what some would call \\"the good death\\"; that is, an accepting, contemplative, deliberate windup of one's life and relationships with others. It implies a quiet expiration where the dying one tries to make the least demands on his care givers.<br /><br /> There was none of this for Bob Schwartz, an ebullient man who cherished life, lived life fully, and did not want to see it end. He refused to accept the inevitability and immanence of his death and acted to the end as if he would never accept it. This attitude placed increased and extraordinary demands on Bob's family, friends, and care givers. It seemed selfish in a way. It was not a \\"good death\\" by conventional understanding.<br /><br /> The author's primary theme focuses on a comparison between the so-called \\"good death\\" and Bob's type of death. Bob was true to himself, his history, and his nature. For him to do it any other way would have been personally dishonest. For a man who lived a good, community-oriented, selfless life, to give up on that attitude would be difficult and wrong. Hence, the admiration of Bob's way by those who observed his difficult demise, despite the hardships. Bob's death, like his life, was honest, and despite the difficulties of his death process, his way of dying was probably the best choice for him. In his case, an honest death trumped the virtues of the \\"good death\\".<br /><br /> For anyone who has experienced closely the lingering death of a relative or friend, it is no surprise to learn of the availability of a huge number of personal memories and journalistic pieces about the experience. It certainly is one of the most impactful, poignant, challenging, and provocative experiences one can have. Hare's description of the honest death of Bob Schwartz involving the tragic alteration of Bob's expectations and wants, the effects on his family and his large community of friends and associates, the gritty details of his physical decline, and the emotional moments of the entire 22-month process would be, all by itself, a worthwhile read.<br /><br /> Hare is a natural storyteller, being a community columnist for the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle newspaper. He writes several columns per week framing stories based on local news, events, and topics relevant to the paper's readership. Like a knowledgeable and experienced photographer who understands he \\"makes\\" pictures rather than merely \\"takes\\" pictures, a good story writer like Hare \\"makes\\" a story, not just by topic selection, but by the shaping of the story, entwining factual elements with more general themes of community history, morals, and values, and relating a message (or messages) for the readership to consider. He has the ability to express himself in very accessible language written for the \\"average Joe\\", and has a very economical writing style, using the fewest words and phrases to express ideas and events. Each word and phrase appears to be carefully weighed and chosen to perform its literary function. There is an \\"Everyman-like\\" quality of expression to a community of \\"Everymen\\" readers.<br /><br /> But beyond the story of Bob's life and death, there is the parallel story of Hare's participation in the process of Bob's dying and how it affected him. The author is unusually frank about his feelings and thoughts during his participation in Bob's lingering death, a man of his same age. He feels compelled to question his own life and expectations about the \\"good death\\". He relates his innermost feelings  on a variety of the experiences Bob was undergoing and asking himself over and over again, would he, if he was in Bob's position, make the same choices. If not, what choices and whose choices are better? Hare is intellectually honest enough to know that no one can answer those questions for anyone else, but that each individual has to decide for himself.<br /><br /> He comes to a realization that maintenance of honesty and sincerity is more important than the conventional virtues of a \\"good death\\". More importantly, Bob's way of dying helps to illuminate a person's understanding of life. Bob's life and his inability or unwillingness to accept death provides lessons for the living. What matters most is how one chooses to live one's life. And, choice is a paramount concept for all of us. You can say that, in effect, Bob chose his own way of dying - an admirable, honest way of dying. Bob also made good choices in his life, proven by the existence of his supportive family, huge number of friends, and acquaintances who believed he was a great person. Obviously, the author was impressed enough to tell Bob's story in this book.<br /><br />  \\"Watching My Friend Die\\" is more than the simply- stated stories of Bob's choice of dying and Hare's reactions to it. Barely noticeable among the story lines are slight threads of humanism and existential themes. Hare describes the very human beliefs, emotions, psychology, and physicality of the dying protaganist and those others involved in the experience. People have complex and conflicting responses to their life experiences and the personal responsibility they have in life outcomes including the death experience. There is,  maybe, like in Bob's case at his very end, uncertainty and doubts about even the most important things including the existence and nature of God. One tends to develop enhanced recognition of the personal choices in both life and death available to each of us.<br /><br />  Throughout there are questions. There are also answers, at least for Hare. His answer is faith, primarily expressed in Catholic concepts, but in actuality touching upon spirituality in general. He emphasizes the value of his own personal faith in God and in the \\"Community of Saints\\" - that group of people both living and dead who provide support for those faced with tragedy and death.<br /><br /> For such a slender book, this work layers the interesting story of Bob's noble death, a story of the author's learning about himself through his experience of Bob's death, and some universal philosophical themes about life and death. The author states that he writes to make some difference - to try to help others in the community to improve their own lives. This well-written, accessible book seems to be an ideal choice for reading lists for educators teaching about such important topics as death, religion, and existential and humanist philosophies.ider.

It is part of a new \\"Spring Into\\" series of books from Prentice Hall which intend to provide concise, fast-paced tutorials for new and developing technologies primarily for non-professionals and those professionals who need  or want a quick and easy way to transition to new technology.<br /><br /> The author, Steven Holzner, is a prolific writer on technology, having penned 88 programming books as well as being a contributor to PC Magazine. His intent here is to make a technological topic like PHP scripting accessible, especially for novices who have little familiarity with web-related language other than HTML. He states an intent to produce \\"as good a book on PHP as can be\\". This is a good book but lacks depth and completeness and does not cover many practical uses of PHP. There is minimal discussion of security issues. There are other publications which would complement this book. The examples of PHP scripts are very simple and sometimes not practical.<br /><br /> The structure of the book is represented in nine chapters covering the basics of PHP for web designers. Each chapter is separately divided into \\"chunks\\" - bite-sized pieces of material -  supported by examples and illustrated code snips. Each chunk is only about 1-2 pages long and is meant to be a self-contained \\"module\\", while building upon others in the book. Downloadable code examples are available at (...).<br /><br /> Holzner starts by briefly describing the why and how of PHP and quickly moves to installation issues. The following chapters cover the essentials of using PHP on a modest-sized website. The concepts of PHP are explained first - the terms, operations, syntax, components, and more.<br /><br /> Chapter 3 discusses strings and arrays. Chapter 4 covers functions. Chapter 5 and 6 show how to use PHP to control web pages, web forms and user interactivity. The usefulness of PHP for connecting to and using databases is noted.<br /><br /> Later chapters cover object-oriented programming, file handling, and working with databases. The final chapter skims a handful of useful aspects of PHP programming - using cookies and sessions, the ftp and mail features, and more.<br /><br /> Perhaps the most useful parts of the book are the two appendices. Appendix A is a listing of PHP's language elements. Appendix B is a comprehensive reference of PHP functions.<br /><br /> This is a rather light introduction to PHP, primarily for novices. There are useful tables of string and array functions and illustrations or examples on nearly every page. The illustrations and examples are produced in grayscale instead of full-color, but there is no need for full-color glossy production elements in a book of this type. The cost savings are reflected in the book's price - only $29.95 - less than others covering the same or similar material.noted.

The author is described as one the \\"top 25 most influential women on the Internet\\", having 30 books to her credit as well as being an influential thinker.<br /><br /> What is called \\"HTML\\" here really means \\"XHTML\\" and this book is one of a number currently promoting standards-compliant web design using XHTML and CSS. Like the others in this series, this book is written for quick reading of short 1-2 page \\"chunks\\" detailing one of a large handful of topics related to contemporary webpage design promoting adherence to the World Wide Web Consortium standards and will have its most value for less-technically experienced web designers..<br /><br /> Ms. Holzschlag starts right from the top - describing the logical construction of a web page using the now-required \\"Document Data-Type\\" header and proceeding through the usual Head section to other page objects. These objects include text paragraphs, links,  images, media, and tables which are styled with CSS. Basic CSS concepts are explained and examples of styling include styling text and tables, forms, layouts, positioning and more.<br /><br /> Nearly every page contains sidebars of related items, illustrations, or code examples. Strangely, some of the examples involve color settings for backgrounds, lines and text but the illustrations are all gray-scale color.  No matter, as the examples are simple and clear enough. There is appropriate note of browser-compatibility issues and how to work around them.<br /><br /> The 13 chapters are supplemented by long, comprehensive annotated references of XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1, containing over 70 pages all together. Downloadable code examples are available at (...).<br /><br /> This is a light introduction to the subject matter with fast-paced writing and is well-populated with examples.	2005-05-26

Consider the current and recent cultural rages - the iPod, MP3s, podcasting, satellite radio - which all are digitally-based.<br /><br /> Bruce Fries and Marty Fries, in a new book from O'Reilly Media, Inc., \\"Digital Audio Essentials\\", describe what is happening now with digital sound, how and why digital formats and transmissions are replacing analog versions, and how consumers and music fans can use and experiment with digital sound and music. In addition, they explain how best not to be subject to a Summons from the recording industry for improper activities with digital music. Downloaders and file-sharers take note!<br /><br /> The authors are technology consultants, with specializations in digital sound. They very broadly cover nearly all aspects of the transformation from analog to digital sound. In five parts and seventeen chapters, this book provides a historical perspective on the technological developments propelling the digital sound revolution, comprehensive coverage about the acquiring, listening to, creating, editing, playing, streaming, organizing, and sharing digital compositions, and mixes in a heavy scoop of material of the evolving rights, duties, and responsibilities arising from the legal system regarding usages of the new technology. I presume the heavy publicity about the recording industry's crackdown on music file-sharing has created a sense of seriousness about this business.<br /><br /> There is a large amount of information being provided in this book about nearly all aspects of digital sound. The topics are covered generally and broadly, without great depth and are written to be easily understood by primarily digital sound novices. Consider the book a primer for listeners, creators, and users of digital sound. For nearly all aspects of the digital transformation, the authors provide some background and history of the changes, some light scientific material about digital technology and the physics of sound, handfuls of helpful tutorials on the use of some of the most popular software applications, and provide some hardware and software purchase/recommendations, while steadily throughout noting the legalities of each aspect.<br /><br /> The software discussions encompass both Mac and PC applications and a number of sections detail enough about programs like iTunes, Music Match, and Media Jukebox, to allow one to create playlists, burn them to CDs or DVDs, and make MP3 files. The discussions about hardware include speaker selections, soundcards, cabling and connector types, as well as how to select a suitable portable music player and accessories.<br /><br /> The most practical material covers how to choose an online music retailer or subscription service, and what features to most consider in purchasing a portable music player and, in Chapter 14, details how to digitalize your record and tape collections. There is guidance on how to even improve sound quality using sound editors to control hiss and noise, and crackle and pops.<br /><br /> I was intrigued by the chapter on setting up your own internet radio station, which appears to be surprisingly easy. The authors note the existence of commercial hosting services  and software packages which make things as easy as they can get for a novice internet DJ.<br /><br /> The final chapter is entirely about copyright law and includes, among other things, nine examples of how one can go afoul of the laws of copyright.

US	50063577	R3NIKCLHKT0NY	1590594282	232793985	Extreme Photoshop CS	Books	5	10	12	N	N	Wonderful and inspirational!	Photoshop has been known for years as one of the most capable and powerful software packages available. Each iteration to the present Photoshop CS version has gotten more and more powerful and feature-rich. For many people, Photoshop is frighteningly hard to learn and use beyond mere photo editing - tonal and color adjustment, cropping, retouching, and the like. However, for those who know how to take advantage of its power, it is an amazing tool for creating original images.<br /><br /> Matt Kloskowski, the author of \\"Extreme Photoshop CS\\", is one such knowledgeable person. In the small handful of creative exercises contained in the book, he demonstrates how creative and efficient one can be with Photoshop in producing original realistic and photo-realistic images. There are nearly a dozen extended-length exercises in this handsomely-produced, well-illustrated, full-color book of 401 pages (including index). Each exercise is a step-by-step demonstration of the use of some of Photoshop's many tools and features by a master creative artist to make realistic and cartoon and comic book-style images. The book's text and illustrations about Photoshop CS will make sense for both PC and Mac users.<br /><br /> Make no mistake about it, even thorough and expert knowledge of Photoshop itself is insufficient to create such images. Software tools, even great ones, cannot substitute for the \\"artist's eye\\" and artistic talent. In one exercise early in the book, the author shows step-by-step how to create a photo-realistic image of a fishbowl illuminated by natural light from a blank canvas using Photoshop tools requiring a bare minimum of what we conventionally think of as artist's skills - drawing, brushing, and texturing. There are 49 steps in creating the finished fish bowl, and even for novice Photoshop users like myself, each and every one seems fairly simple to duplicate. No special manual or advanced graphic software talent seems required. However, taking a step back and comparing the blank canvas starting point to the finished product produces a sense of wonderment. There is no way a novice user like myself could create such a finished product without the actual step-by-step guidance of an accomplished artist. The untrained or unskilled artist-wannabe could hardly perceive, artistically, the structural perspectives, lighting patterns, reflections,  refractions, and more - much less produce realistic results even with Photoshop's wonderful tools.<br /><br /> Kloskowski is an established illustrator and graphic designer and an Adobe-certified expert. He has written several design-related books, as well as written columns for the National Association of Photoshop Professionals, Mac Design, and other publications. In this book, he shows how Photoshop can aid those already blessed with an innate or trained \\"artist's eye\\" to produce high quality images quickly and efficiently. This book is not meant to be a traditional user's manual on Photoshop. Although a fair number of tools and features are described and explained, there is no thorough exploration of all that Photoshop has to offer. This is also not a book on how to draw or paint or even \\"see\\" like an artist. It is more of a blending of these themes to demonstrate how Photoshop is useful for people who have not experienced the power of digital tools.<br /><br /> This book is not intended to make anyone an expert on Photoshop itself. The author merely states what tools, settings, and work flow sequences he uses to make his images. There is more of a demonstrative or inspirational intent here than teaching detailed knowledge of the software.<br /><br /> Instead, the author describes how to use the software to quickly and relatively easily create (for experienced Photoshop users) a variety of image types. For each type, but especially for the realistic and photo-realistic styles, Kloskowski elucidates the traditional artistic elements necessary to make 2D productions which imply 3D scenes. For nature images, for example, he describes the need for perspective (linear and atmospheric), shadows, reflection, depth of field, and color rendition. These are the artistic building blocks of an effective image. From that basis, he demonstrates which tools and features of Photoshop are most relevant for implementing those effects.<br /><br /> A secondary theme is an emphasis on being efficient in building an image. Perhaps it is the author's business and client-related experience which has focused him on the quick and efficient production of images. This is accomplished by planning the construction of images with future editing in mind and the reusability of components of an image, including constructed shapes, patterns, adjustment layers, and more.<br /><br /> \\"Extreme Photoshop CS\\" has four parts which detail how to create original art from scratch emphasizing a number of different styles - realistic, photo-realistic, realistic 3D, cartoon and comic book looks, icons and emoticons, silhouette, wireframe illustrations and stylized photo images. The most used tools include the pen  to create vector shapes, the brush  to add textures, and the blending modes for tonal and color adjustments. When used by an expert, surprisingly few of Photoshop's many tools are needed to create realistic original images.<br /><br /> Part One focuses on tools and techniques to create realism. Complementing the information on the relevant tools and settings is discussion of how to create lifelike scenes on a two-dimensional surface. The key is in the artist's understanding of how to create the illusions of depth, motion, and texture utilizing traditional artistic concepts of perspective, light and shadow, relative spacing, color relationships and the like.<br /><br /> Part Two moves into a different type of realism - cartoon and comic book styles. Here, the intent is not to create \\"trompe l'oeil\\" realistic or photo-realistic but to make stylized natural imagery for different looks and effects. Here the most relevant tools are the pencil and various selection tools. The blending of aesthetics and computer is again shown in the extended presentation of what Kloskowski calls the \\"mathematics of pixel art\\". Here he shows how to use defined shapes, grids, angles, and layers to precisely structure parts of images and to create custom text.<br /><br /> Chapter Six contains two shorter exercises on how to create anthropomorphic icons and emoticons. In less than two dozen steps each, he creates remarkable images using a small handful of PhotoShop tools. It is the combination of software and artistic skill which is inspiring. Chapter Seven contains descriptions and examples of a variety of cartoon  and comic book styles and an extended exercise in creating a manga-style cartoon character.<br /><br /> Part 3 demonstrates advanced illustration techniques using Photoshop. The aesthetic subjects are silhouettes, wire frame, and stylized photographs. Part Four shows how to create retro and vintage art images including art deco, Bauhaus/Constructivist, and pop art -Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol style. The final chapter describes how to build a reusable library of retro design components, such as shapes as building blocks, fonts, patterns, and color palettes.hich imply 3D scenes.

US	50063577	R2XRPUJC0BQYLA	0596004532	727747632	Photoshop Elements 3: The Missing Manual	Books	5	143	145	N	N	A fine primer to a powerful program	Although Photoshop Elements 3 is but the mere little brother of Photoshop CS, it is nevertheless a very powerful and feature-rich application. It is intended to appeal to the  nonprofessional graphics person and especially the digital camera and photo hobbyists who want to edit their digital snapshots. While easier to learn and use than its big brother, Elements 3 still is a program which is not easily used well by \\"hunt and click\\" investigation.<br /><br /> Hence, there is a definite need for \\"Photoshop Elements 3: The Missing Manual\\", the latest such entry in the series of \\"Missing Manuals\\" published by O'Reilly Media,Inc./Pogue Press. This series, in my opinion, is the benchmark for applications manuals, better than virtually any OEM-provided manual (rare these days, except for online hypertext versions) and more than mere manuals. This book continues the series themes of not only describing and explaining the subject application's features but in providing technical background guidance on its particular subject areas. Here it is how and why to edit photos, the concepts behind taking and making better photos, user-level insights on what works best, all wrapped in a casual writing style with some humor.<br /><br /> David Pogue, the editor of the series (and who has written the bulk of the volumes in the series) does it best - he writes with style and humor which elevates the manual beyond a mere manual, but an enjoyable light technical read. The other authors of  the series' volumes, including Elements 3's author, Barbara Brundage, are also very adept technical writers who clearly and comprehensively cover their subject material.<br /><br /> I would describe Ms. Brundage, a member of the Adobe Elements preproduction group and graphics teacher, as having done a fine, workmanlike  job. The book reads more \\"manual-like\\" than some of the others, but the subject material is daunting. In seven parts and 17 chapters she introduces Elements 3, proceeds through the bulk of the application's tools and features, explains how to share and distribute creations, and shows how to do some advanced work with the program. Appendixes describe the program's components menu by menu. Particular attention is drawn to the differences between the PC and the Mac version of Elements throughout each specific section.<br /><br /> While the book emphasizes the how of digital photo editing, it makes sure to cover the tools which facilitate creation of original artwork, especially the brush, shaping, and similar tools. Every stage of the creative process is covered, beginning with how to import photos into the program and manage them with the Organizer (PC) and File Browser. Basic editing techniques like rotating, resizing, and cropping are covered in the beginning chapters, while more involved techniques like use of the many selection tools and options, use of layers, applying the sharpening tools, and mastering the tonal adjustment tools - like levels, hue and saturation, and burn and dodge tools -  are explained later.<br /><br /> The most interesting chapters deal with the more advanced topics. Chapter 9 is called \\"Retouching 102\\" and describes how to fix blemishes, apply patterns, change colors, create black and white images, and how to apply special effects. Chapter 12 informs about Elements' multiple filters, effects, layer styles, and gradients. Chapter 13 deals with effects with type.<br /><br /> There is complete coverage of all of the contents of Elements. Elements can, for example, prepare photos for web and email usages, and create photo galleries, slideshows, and panoramas. There is a brief chapter on extending Elements by use of graphics tablets, plug-ins, and configuring Elements to work more like Photoshop CS.<br /><br /> This is a handsomely-produced book with great, full-color illustrations. Virtually every page has a photo or graphic screenshot, comparison images, chart, or other informative illustration.<br /><br /> I'm a big fan of the \\"Missing Manual\\" series and this book is a fine addition.br /> I'm a big fan of the \\"Missing Manual\\" series and this book is a fine addition. <br /> <br />	2005-05-05

I have read and reviewed a half dozen this year alone. People are obviously trying to tell us something - plain HTML has to go!! \\"Web Designers' Reference: An Integrated Approach to Web Design with XHTML and CSS\\" by Craig Grannell is the latest of these pronouncements.<br /><br /> The reasons are clear and compelling. The World Wide Web Consortium which promulgates web design standards has decreed HTML as obsolete. Newer, more compliant browsers, will in time not support the older tags and code; the new standards facilitate much better use by the disabled of screen readers and non-graphic browsers. Not least, the newer code makes writing and revising code easier and more efficient, as well as more capable.<br /><br /> These are certainly good reasons for web designers to move to the new code. Nevertheless, surveys show that most web pages are not compliant and that thousands of designers continue to use deprecated code. I confess that I am one of them. After a number of years learning and getting used to HTML, the need to learn new and more code is onerous. The inertia of habit is a factor I'm sure.<br /><br /> For those web designers like me, Mr. Grannell's book is a welcome addition to the literature because it systematically deals with the topics under discussion. In its coverage of XHTML, CSS, Javascript, and complementary coding like php, it provides a nice framework guiding \\"old dogs\\" like me into standards-compliant code. Not only does it provide some historical perspectives on these codes, it compares the old with the new in regard to all of the important elements of web design.<br /><br /> The author is an experienced web designer and operates a design and writing agency. He also writes articles for a number of computer magazines.<br /><br /> Grannell's goals are to teach cutting-edge, efficient coding, and how to master standards-compliant XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1. There are a dozen chapters. He breaks down the elements of web design into modular components so that one can focus on each element separately, like page structure, content structure, layout, navigation, text control, user feedback, and multimedia. Relevant technologies are explained in context of producing a typical website.<br /><br /> If one finally decides to move forward, as many suggest, this is a very good volume by which to get your start. It will facilitate a fresh start for the \\"old dogs\\". For new designers, this is a nice primer to learn what is expected, in an overall sense, of good, advanced web design.<br /><br /> This is a well-produced book with clear writing, comprehensive approach, dozens of practical examples, and downloadable files with the code examples used in the book. The author writes in a logical sequence much like an engineer would. It is a heavy text-book-like read, only lightly sprinkled with style and personality. It should appeal primarily to novice designers, but has enough advanced information to satisfy an experienced designer who is looking for that fresh start.<br /><br /> The structure of the book facilitates the \\"fresh-start\\" idea. It starts with a web design overview giving an experienced user's tips on what software to use to write code, what browsers to design for, how to build pages from the very top to the bottom. (XHTML, unlike HTML, requires a preliminary document-type definition (DTD) to validate. Only after the introductory section does the first HTML tag appear.)<br /><br /> Like others writing in this area, he firmly advocates design for standards compliance, usability, accessibility, and last and least, visual design. Marketing Department people may want to choke on that priority list but there is no inherent conflict between function and aesthetics. Grannell does not spend a lot of time on the aesthetics aspect.<br /><br /> The middle chapters concentrate on modular construction of pages - the XHTML introduction, the structural elements like text blocks and images, the logical structure of the links and navigation flow, and finally, the stylizing with CSS. Comparisons of pages styled with HTML vs. CSS compellingly demonstrate the benefits and advantages of CSS. There will be no going back once you've decided to upgrade your technical approach.<br /><br /> Basic CSS concepts are explained and illustrated with code samples and screenshots. Grannell describes how to use CSS for text control, navigation, and layouts. There is a broad section on frames and another on forms and interactive components.<br /><br /> The last chapter covers testing and tweaking including how to create a 7 item browser test suite. Much time is used throughout the book in discussing overcoming browser quirks. There is detailed technical information, especially in regard to the XHTML introductory section of the page, which I have not seen elsewhere.<br /><br /> There are three welcome reference appendices at the end covering XHTML tags and attributes, web color coding, and a very comprehensive entities chart noting currencies, European characters, math symbols and more.<br /><br /> Much of this material is covered elsewhere in the growing set of publications about standards-compliant code. This book has the virtue of having a useful overall perspective on web design and acts as a framework for new designers and converting designers to renew and upgrade their technical approaches.modular construction of pages - the XHTML introduction, the structural elements like text blocks and images, the logical structure of the links and navigation flow, and finally, the stylizing with CSS.

US	50063577	R1KK8UILCC06AQ	0131481991	646819983	Web Design Garage	Books	5	51	52	N	N	Nice bookshelf reference	\\"Web Design Garage\\" is a remarkably clear-headed, concisely-written and feature-rich book about contemporary web design topics. It is part of a \\"Garage\\" series of hip-looking, style-laden books published by Prentice Hall (Prentice Hall Professional Technical Reference -PH PTR) and is targeted at the \\"garage\\" level designer - small business professionals, hobbyists, and technophiles. It assumes some modest familiarity of HTML and working with Javascripts.<br /><br />This is not a primer, tutorial, or concept-bound book. It is meant to provide practical guidance and solutions to the most common web design issues dealt with by web designers. Author, Marc Campbell, offers a set of 86 topics about web design problems and solutions. The format for nearly all of the 86 topics is to highlight a design issue and offer solutions using pictures, examples, and code snippets. Although a good and quick read from beginning to end, the book can be read piecemeal for information and guidance on a specific issue. One can pick and chose topics depending on interest or need.<br /><br />There are no traditional chapters, but only a set of design topics of relatively short length organized into 8 general categories. Those categories include design and usability topics, layout, images, text, links, forms, and two others, - one of miscellaneous items  and the last being an explanation of basic web design material. There is also an index and a short glossary of HTML, CSS, web, and graphics-related terms.<br /><br />The fundamental theme of the book is that design and usability are, or should be, the same thing. Usability is paramount, of course, but the author's approach to web design emphasizes creating a \\"sense of place\\" so that good design unites pages so that they look like they belong together.<br /><br />This is not an earth-shattering idea, but like most of all of the design treatments, the goal is to design pages which make it easy for visitors to use the site. Many good design virtues are virtually invisible to the casual user. There is a blend of design and usability. It's only when a design element doesn't work well that it comes to the attention of the user, and that occurrence is meant to be avoided. The author shows by example how design and usability are intertwined.<br /><br />There are a handful of themes which guide the book. Admirably, the author emphasizes for every design element, a concern for accessibility. Many of the design guides refer to accessibility by screen-readers and non-graphic browsers. A second major concern is for compliance with contemporary web design standards as promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium. Consequently, there is much emphasis on the separation of page structure from content where HTML is used for structure and CSS is used for content. A contrast of HTML and CSS formatting is highlighted in many of the chapters.<br /><br />There is a large handful of sections which express HTML and CSS formatting differences on page layout, text and image positioning, and other web design elements. There is clear discussion on how to work with Javascripts and stylesheets. The emphasis is on \\"forward-looking\\" coding, i.e., clean, standards compliant, and accessibility conscious. Campbell offers an experienced designer's insights on choices to be made in design components. There is much value for both inexperienced and seasoned designers.<br /><br />Each topic is richly expressed with clear and straightforward text, illustrations, screenshots, and sidebars on a variety of related matters. Throughout there are sidebars titled \\"FAQS\\" and \\"Geekspeak\\" explaining concepts or terminology for the less-knowledgable reader. Then there are those called \\"Tips\\" which usually offer an insight to practical problems, especially dealing with browser compatibility issues. There are many useful tables and charts indexing specific tag attributes, with examples. In addition and most useful are the \\"Toolkits\\" which are sample code snippets. It would have been nice to have the code snippets available for downloading from the publisher's web site ([...]<br /><br />This is a dense volume containing all sorts of information useful for the \\"garage\\" web designer. For some reason, the depth and weight of the content is reflected in the book itself, which is remarkably heavy, weighing in at a well-produced 29 ounces.<br /><br />There are many books available on basic web design, but this one is unusually clear and well-expressed. This is the type of book one keeps handy in the bookshelf next to the computer to access for quick solutions to everyday web design problems.which are sample code snippets.

Evolutionary scientists are fond of emphasizing that the world as we know it is fundamentally an outcome of a random series of sequences involving biomasses, chemicals, bacteria, and other goodies heated at high temperature and simmered, like soup, over centuries, until it resulted in \\"us\\". In the late seventies and early eighties, there were the Apple Computer Company, the author and his inspired colleagues, Silicon Valley technology developments, a business economy open to new ideas, the vision and energy of Steve Jobs, and more. Occasionally, good things happen historically out of the random interaction of essentially unrelated components. This is how the Macintosh computer came to be.<br /><br />The story is told in \\"Revolution in the Valley - The Insanely Great Story of How the Mac Was Made\\". This is a wonderfully-produced book written by one of the major principals in the development of the Mac, Andy Hertzfeld, a software engineer. The story unfolds in about 80 short recollections and anecdotes, mostly contributed by Hertzfeld, memoir-like. A small handful were contributed by other principals in the Mac's early development - Steve Capps, Donn Denman, Bruce Horn, and Susan Kare, the legendary graphic designer responsible for most of the enduring interface symbols.<br /><br />The focus is primarily on the people who made the Mac. They were primarily young, enthusiastic, motivated nerds who possessed creativity and genius. There was no shortage of creative geniuses in the nascent computer industry at that time, but the group which created the Mac was special because the Mac was special. It was different. It was the first computer designed to be (relatively) easy to use. It was meant to be for everyone, not just the techno-nerds and corporate spreadsheet wonks, but for those others creative and cognitively nimble enough,  to encompass the computer as a desktop metaphor with powerful and handy tools and features. It was meant to change the world. And it did.<br /><br />Like the primordal, evolutionary ooze, the synergistic interaction of these people with the developments around them in computer technology, the idealism and vision of people in the Silicon Valley environment, and the shear dynamic force of the computer itself, created an outcome which clearly is significant to many people, and special to Mac fans.<br /><br />The history of the early Mac is inherently of interest, but the presentation here makes it feel special. The production values of this book are topnotch. This is a hefty hardcover very well designed to not only convey the story, but to evoke the culture and ethos surrounding Mac history in both words and images. There are scans of contemporaneous personal notes and sketches by some of the engineers and designers. There are plenty of individual and group photos of the relevant personalities. There are photos of the work environment, the hardware, and the look of the software as it evolved. There are loads of illustrations of original graphics designs, icons and fonts, and screen images. The overall look of the book evokes the aesthetics of the time period with interesting use of colored text, page layouts, and fonts, together with graphics of early topical magazine covers, advertisements, and media presentations, and more. Except for the lack of music, everything is here and ready for a Ken Burns video production. Seriously.<br /><br />Of course, the stories are most important and there are plenty of interesting and humorous memories of people and events. Steve Jobs is the chief character, of course, but Bill Gates and Mick Jagger play roles as well. The story of how a pirate flag was flown over one of Apple's design buildings reflects the attitude, in part, which inspired the Mac development team. For the nerdiest fans, the story of how the \\"marching ants\\" representation of a screen selection in graphics programs came to be, is a treasure.<br /><br />This is an exceptional production.did. <br /> <br />Like the primordal, evolutionary ooze, the synergistic interaction of these people with the developments around them in computer technology, the idealism and vision of people in the Silicon Valley environment, and the shear dynamic force of the computer itself, created an outcome which clearly is significant to many people, and special to Mac fans. <br /> <br />The history of the early Mac is inherently of interest, but the presentation here makes it feel special.

Not in designing the operating system, of course, but in explaining how to use it. Pogue has written \\"Windows XP Home Edition: The Missing Manual, 2nd Ed.\\", which is an update of the original 2002 Edition. Although he is long associated with writing about the Apple Macintosh operating system and applications, here he demonstrates his knowledge of the Windows XP system as well. The book covers the latest version of XP Home, including the Service Pack 2 update.<br /><br />Pogue is currently a computer columnist for the NY Times and the author of 35 books, most notably many in the \\"Missing Manual\\" series published by Pogue Press/O'Reilly Media, Inc. With that  series, Pogue has created a \\"template \\" for explaining operating systems and applications  for non-technical users of all levels which almost cannot be improved upon. He describes and explains technical material in a straight-forward manner in clear, concise language. Nearly every page of the Manuals include either an illustration, chart, or sidebar helping to facilitate both reading and learning. More significantly, he mixes humor, practical experience insights and guidance, and some mild critique of the software to create manuals which don't really read as mere manuals. No one likes to read manuals after all, but Pogue makes such reading as pleasant as it can be, as well as being functional, of course.<br /><br />This book starts by introducing some developmental history of the Windows operating system and provides some basics of the system. It describes the newest features of XP, and realistically notes the \\"Dark Side\\" of the current Microsoft offering - its security weaknesses, its privacy issues, its continual use of proprietary data and other formats, and its less than subtle marketing features. Pogue is not writing a critical work here, but fairly comments on matters which confront the user of XP, both to help explain a feature and why it works in a certain way, and to let the reader know that what seems like an oddity in design or function is not due to  the user's failures.<br /><br />There are five parts comprised of 18 chapters of substantive material covering pretty much everything a non-technical user needs to know about using and maintaining the XP operating system, as well as how to use the many applications which come with it. The book provides material on backing up files, maintaining the operating system, and troublesho  oting. There are whole sections just on configuring the various Control Panels to customize one's machine, and a menu-by-menu description of XP Home.<br /><br />There is even material for higher level users and for those who want to know more about the higher-level technical stuff. There are \\"power user\\" tips sprinkled throughout the book and Appendix C, for example, discusses the Windows Registry where novices are discouraged. Pogue describes the Registry, how to edit it, and even provides some (safe) examples.<br /><br />There is plenty of material here for virtually everyone, including those who just want or need to know about specific matters, like how to handle digital photos and sound files, how to configure and use the chat and video conferencing applications, or in adding hardware, like printers, scanners, and external drives.<br /><br />Perhaps the best aspect of it all is that all this good writing and printing production costs only $24.95.

I'm one of them. The problem is that the modern trend is away from HTML table and layout formatting and towards newer standards-compliant means.  The protocols and standards of the World Wide Web are evolving towards \\"cleaner\\" code, more standardized code, and more capable code, generally guided by principles and standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium, known as W3C.<br /><br />In the book, \\"The CSS Anthology: 101 Essential Tips, Tricks, and Hacks\\", author Rachel Andrew provides an easy way for hold-outs to ease into CSS design. This is not a treatise or concept-minded book, but a practical introduction and guide to putting CSS to immediate use in real-world contexts that every web designer is already familiar with. The author shows how to use CSS to style text, format headings and images, create navigation, style forms and user interfaces, and work with browser-compatibility issues.<br /><br />Andrew is a working web designer and applications designer and presents the material in a very straightforward practical manner - almost as if the reader was following along at a workshop. The writing is clear, all examples are illustrated with relevant code samples, and she offers the insights of an experienced professional regarding everyday problems and solutions.<br /><br />The book is composed of a preface, nine chapters, and an index. Chapter 1 is an introduction to CSS showing why it is replacing HTML table and layout formatting, and the basic concepts of CSS. The other chapters are set up in a \\"problem/solution\\" format where various design issues - text styling, image layout, etc. - are presented and solved by adept usage of CSS.<br /><br />Even readers who have never paid much attention to CSS will quickly get a useful, working sense of how it is used and how to use it immediately themselves. Although CSS is yet another language to learn, Andrew presents it in such a way that it seems like it is an easy learn. And it demonstrably is, as here, easy to use.<br /><br />The best parts of the book are the designer tips from an experienced code-writer on how to work with code across different browsers and platforms, and how to understand that browsers have two modes of parsing - a compliant mode and a \\"quirks\\" mode.  Some browsers, she shows, just have \\"quirks\\", especially Microsoft's Internet Explorer. (Surprise!).

It is comprised of studio examples from eight French graphic professionals who provide explanations of the steps in the evolution of an original photo,  illustration, or mere concept to a final stage usable by commercial professionals.<br /><br />The eight examples are presented by professionals described as leading French artists and as translated from a 2003 French edition. They cover digitally restoring old images, improving holiday images, how to improve color renditions with a colorimeter, retouching facial and skin imagery, blending multiple images, and enhancing already existing images.<br /><br />Among the examples, the reader will learn how these professionals review and imagine an initial project, how they collaborate with artistic directors and other parties involved in a commercial project, how they choose formats, and present an impression. Of course, the emphasis is on using Photoshop in creating commercial masterpieces from preliminary source material. I found it interesting that all but one of the experts used Apple Macintosh computers, but clearly the instruction, tips, and Photoshop-settings screenshots are not platform specific.<br /><br />The level of presentation is clearly for imaging professionals and serious Photoshop users. Much of the workshops assume advanced graphic as well as Photoshop experience. None of the presentations is a real step-by-step instruction, but more \\"stage-by-stage\\". These stages are well-illustrated and screenshots of Photoshop settings windows are used extensively.<br /><br />Some of the retouching examples are amazing. Chapter 2, entitled, \\"Digital Surgery\\", demonstrates how a professional figure model's bodily features and posture are altered for purposes of the commercial expression. The steps used to arch her back using Photoshop illustrate not only how powerful Photoshop is, but how clever highly-competent professionals can be.<br /><br />Other workshops show how to enhance skin textures and color tonality, how to slice and dice unrelated photos to create a new one purporting to be realistic but is not, how to use colorization in creating multiple images in one illustration, how to create 4 x 13' panoramics, how to create photo images supplemented by special effects utilized in the film industry to create movie settings, and how flawless, spectacular product shots are made.<br /><br />This is a nice little volume offering tips and inspiration about digital retouching for the graphic professional.he steps used to arch her back using Photoshop illustrate not only how powerful Photoshop is, but how clever highly-competent professionals can be. <br /> <br />Other workshops show how to enhance skin textures and color tonality, how to slice and dice unrelated photos to create a new one purporting to be realistic but is not, how to use colorization in creating multiple images in one illustration, how to create 4 x 13' panoramics, how to create photo images supplemented by special effects utilized in the film industry to create movie settings, and how flawless, spectacular product shots are made. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a nice little volume offering tips and inspiration about digital retouching for the graphic professional.	2005-01-19

If you can get someone else to buy your son or daughter, your sister or Grandma, an iBook from Apple, then you can buy the perfect stocking-stuffer for that lucky person - the\\" iBook Fan Book\\" by Derrick Story. This is a little 6 by 6 inch square, thin white volume which mimics the look of the iBook itself and is designed to provide a gentle introduction to the iBook.<br /><br /> The basic approach of this book is to provide just the amount of information and guidance needed to get a new iBook owner up to speed in using it and getting comfortable with it. It does not cover all you can know about the iBook or the Mac OSX operating system and applications. There are other books available for that, including many published by the same publisher of this book, O'Reilly Media, Inc. Each of them is noted in this book as additional resources for those who want more in-depth information and guidance.<br /><br /> This book is designed to point out (to primarily non-techie types), for example, what the ports on the sides of the iBook are for, how to select a carrying case for the unit, how to clean it and care for it, and more importantly, how to configure it to do the things most people want to do. Those things include personalizing the System Preferences to make the iBook work space reflect the personality and work habits of the owner.<br /><br /> IBook owners, like most Mac owners, are likely to have special relationships with their machines. They like to personalize it and organize it to allow them to do what they really bought the computer for - to listen to music, view photos, make movies, surf the web, and send email. It becomes less of a tool and more like a friend.<br /><br /> Derrick Story has a casual easy-going writing style which provides an almost-soothing voice to the presentation of information and guidance on setting up the iBook.

Check out the book,  \\"Mind Hacks: Tips and Tools for Using Your Brain\\".<br /><br /> This book sets out in layman's terms the enormous developments in the brain sciences in the last two decades, which have lead to an apparent debunking of the metaphor of the brain as a logical, linear, information processor and has elevated the role of biological, emotional, and psychological elements in the understanding of perception. The book asks the reader to explore the architecture of his own brain by sampling the exercises in perception in the book. The intent is to foster a new appreciation of the way the brain (now differently conceived) shapes the reality one perceives.<br /><br /> The impetus for this examination and reevaluation comes from the world of technology, especially because of those tools which test, measure, and scan the brain during experimental acts of perception and behavior. Tools such as electroencephalograms, positron emission tomography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging now allow scientists to see the biological bases of perception via real-time brain scans.  Examples of such studies are contained in the various \\"hacks\\" in this book, as distinct illustrations of the brain's hidden (biologically-based) logic. The authors emphasize that perception is far from straightforward and the brain in some ways has a life of its own.<br /><br /> Author Tom Stafford is a cognitive neuroscientist. The other primary co-author, Matt Webb, is an engineer and designer. Many of the \\"hacks\\" have been contributed by a large handful of others, mostly from the world of natural science research. Each hack is  a probe, so to speak, into the works of the brain in its many aspects of perception - seeing, hearing, touch, attention, reasoning, memory, and more. Most of these hacks are structured into a template - introductory material on the latest science in that topic area, real-life illustrations of the topic, and suggestions for the reader to experiment with his own brain facilities. For example, have you ever thought why you can't normally tickle yourself? Hack #65 explains why and provides a work around. Many of the hacks are illustrated with graphics and others indicate links to websites where one can find text, graphics, video, and sound illustrations. Although these links are quite helpful and illuminating, it can be annoying to have to drop the book, log-on to a computer, and pull up a website before going back to the book to complete that segment.<br /><br /> This book is popular science about significant research and technology advances in the brain sciences. It will appeal to the many readers who like to keep up on important science matters without having to study for a college graduate program. The best chapters are those on Reasoning (Chapter 7) and Togetherness (Chapter 8) which include evidence puncturing the supposed rationality of human activities. Hack #70, for example, shows how the mere arrangement of a list can influence people's selection choices and why marking down a unit price from $20.00 to $19.99 is so significant. Hack #73 discusses the placebo effect and #75 delves lightly into Gestalt phenomenology.<br /><br /> The subject material seems a bit far afield for the publisher, O'Reilly Media, Inc., which has carved out a niche as a purveyor of computer-related books, many of which cover esoteric subjects. This volume of popular science seems to have been shoehorned into the structure of the popular O'Reilly \\"Hacks\\" series, but doesn't quite fit the template of compiling relatively separate clever solutions to discrete computer software problems. Rather than discrete and relatively independent segments, many of the individual hacks here really are just captions or headings separating subject matter.c area, real-life illustrations of the topic, and suggestions for the reader to experiment with his own brain facilities.

PHP (along with program friends - MySQL and Apache) has become very popular among developers and web designers, and for good reason. As a programming language, it is particularly suited to web development projects, while being relatively easy to write, use and learn. More importantly, it's open-source and free, cross-platform, and widely supported.<br /><br /> The book, \\"Learning PHP5\\", by David Sklar, is one of the latest volumes dealing with PHP. It describes itself as \\"a Pain-Free Introduction to Building Interactive Web Sites\\" and provides a gentle introduction to the latest version of PHP, which is version 5 and only recently available.<br /><br /> This book is not particularly useful for those experienced already with PHP, nor for those wanting to upgrade their knowledge of PHP from versions 4 and earlier to the newest version. It probably is not particularly useful for those power programmers who need and want a deep and comprehensive coverage of the topic. But it is a very well-written and designed introduction to PHP 5 for beginning programmers or those experienced PERL, ASP, or Cold Fusion programmers who want to learn a different language. There are many illustrations and code samples sprinkled throughout the book. Sklar, however,  occasionally skims over some topics in furtherance of the completion of some practical examples.<br /><br /> The publisher is O'Reilly Media, Inc. which seems to have an editor's policy of covering complex computer-related topics in a comprehensive manner by publishing a range of volumes covering different aspects of a topic or from different angles or for different audiences. O'Reilly also publishes volumes on moving to PHP 5 (\\"Upgrading to PHP 5\\"), detailed and technical PHP (\\"Programming PHP\\"), and a collection of solutions to common PHP programming problems (\\"The PHP Cookbook\\").<br /><br /> The author, Mr. Sklar, is an experienced consultant in computer software development and technical training. He is the author of \\"Essential PHP Tools\\" and coauthor of the afore-mentioned \\"The PHP Cookbook\\". He takes a deliberate and comprehensive approach to explaining PHP 5, not in great depth, but with an intent of providing enough information, concepts, detail, and scope to create a pleasant and useful read of a technical subject. The basic promise of PHP is in the relatively easy creation of more dynamic and<br /><br />interesting web sites which would include, for example, product catalogs, blogs, photo galleries, event calendars, forms, and more.<br /><br /> There are 13 chapters and 3 appendices. The early chapters provide an orientation to PHP including its place in contemporary web development, its basic rules, and its syntax. They explain the basic background of PHP and how it interacts with the browser and web server. Later chapters introduce primary concepts like loops, arrays, and functions. The idea here is to facilitate learning the fundamentals of the grammar and vocabulary. Chapters 2 through 12 have short exercises at the end of each to allow the reader to practice writing PHP code and to test learning. (The answers are contained in Appendix C.) Experienced programmers and geeks may recoil at the inclusion of these exercises, but they are useful for beginners.<br /><br /> Chapter 6 provides a practical exercise - how to make and use a web form. The author shows how to access form variables, how to validate user-inputted data for security and efficiency reasons, and how to process forms using functions. Chapter 7 shows how PHP interacts with database programs, like SQL and Oracle, but focuses primarily on MySQL, and demonstrates how to organize data, connect to a server-based database, create tables, and input and retrieve data.<br /><br /> The rest of the middle chapters cover the use and implementation of cookies and sessions, handling dates and time, and working with files. The practical exercise using dates and times is creating and displaying a monthly calendar. The final chapters provide brief but practical coverage of XML, debugging, and in Chapter 13, other PHP aspects. PHP is amazingly useful, flexible, and practical. One can deal with graphics, pdf-formatted documents, and other media like Flash and Shockwave. It also has mailing and file uploading  functions, encryption capabilities, and for more experienced coders, the ability to run shell commands. The upgraded PHP 5 has new capabilities which now include object-oriented programming.<br /><br /> Appendix A covers installing and configuring PHP for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux; Appendix B is a short primer on regular expressions and how to use them with PHP.<br /><br /> I found the book to be the most accessible introduction to PHP I have read. It provides the basic fundamentals, engages the reader in practical examples, reinforces learning with exercises, and provides an overall perspective on the scope of PHP programming.<br /><br />  Code examples used in the book can be downloaded at the O'Reilly site.

The Panther OS update continues to provide opportunity for basic users and power users to customize, tweek, and hack their machines. Unlike all previous Apple operating systems, the OSX iterations incorporating Unix underpinnings, legacy OS9 and Classic components, and a continuing evolving Mac GUI, provide unusually rich and complex textures allowing for all kinds of customizations.<br /><br /> The book is a compilation of 100 ideas, hacks, tips, and tweeks contributed by a large handful of developers and power users covering mostly productivity-enhancing items, but also security and maintenance items, and some fun and geeky items. It is designed for the adventurous spirits who may need some guidance in customizing their machine and applications.<br /><br /> There are nine chapters of such hacks. Chapter 1 covers the user interface including how to customize the Apple-provided animations like the \\"genie-effect\\". Available third-party applications for customizing the user interface, like Konfabulator, are noted and evaluated (Hacks #2).Others include launchers, desktop applications, keyboard shortcuts and the like. (Hacks 3-9).<br /><br /> Other sections include an introduction to Applescript, Safari tips and tricks, multi-media tricks, file and device synchronization, and Unix tips and tricks, including how to use the Terminal application. Hack #27 is a guide to the hidden debug menu, which provides access to otherwise unknown Safari and browser features. Hack #30 informs how to use RSS with the Mac. You can learn to build your own MPS server from Hack #41 and build an emergency boot volume with iPod in Hack #52.<br /><br /> Many of the hacks are quick and easy. Some require geek-level knowledge. The most interesting and perhaps most valuable sections deal with Panther maintenance and security. Hack #93 is a 19-page security  primer useful for both basic and power users.deal with Panther maintenance and security.

Its \\"Missing Manual\\" series on Panther is a user's reference on how to use the operating system and its applications for productivity and fun. Its \\"Hacks\\" series provides dozens of tips, guides, and project ideas. In the \\"Nutshell\\" series iteration, \\"MacOSX Panther in a Nutshell\\" designs to provide in-depth, comprehensive information about the inner workings of the OS. It is for power users and developers who want to master the OS and have the fullest description and explanation of OSX.<br /><br /> This book starts out detailing the multi-layered architecture of OSX and illuminates its power and elegance. In great depth and detail, it explains the Unix components, Aqua elements, OS9 and Classic, the Finder, and the multitude of Unix services, daemons, and applications.<br /><br /> This is terse, descriptive prose. The authors focus a sharp telephoto lens on the skeleton, sinews, and pores of OSX, starting with basic elements and probing deep into the details of the file system, networking components, directory services, printing configurations and more. This in-depth description and large handfuls of guides and tips totals over 1,000 pages.<br /><br /> A separate part of the book is devoted to Applescript, X-code tools, and Java. The X-code tools are for developers. Part IV is all about Unix, including three chapters on \\"shells\\" alone, plus sections on text editors, the X-Window system, and a full 262 pages of Unix command references, touted as the most complete such source in print publication.<br /><br /> No mere user manual would have ten pages devoted solely to understanding and managing preference files, or five pages on using the Colorsync feature with Quartz filter scripts.<br /><br /> Surprisingly, only ten pages are dedicated to security issues. Although the Mac is known to be extremely secure, recent news shows even the Mac is vulnerable to sophisticated exploits.<br /><br /> For those with a need to know, this is the definitive source for deep knowledge of OSX.news shows even the Mac is vulnerable to sophisticated exploits. <br /> <br /> For those with a need to know, this is the definitive source for deep knowledge of OSX.	2004-08-31

Who would think a mere \\"search engine\\" would need a manual, especially one 289 pages long (including index)? Well, the Google website is indeed a web-based application that is sophisticated and complex enough to justify a full-fledged volume such as \\"Google: The Missing Manual\\".<br /><br /> This book is yet another of the well-received \\"Missing Manual\\" series by Pogue Press/O'Reilly Media Inc. It covers some of the same ground as O'Reilly's 2003 book, \\"Google Hacks: 100 Industrial Strength Tips and Tools\\". That book emphasized the mechanics of searching, especially power-searching, often using script-driven and programming techniques and tools to improve and fine-tune search results. This volume covers a much broader range of elements involving the Google web site.<br /><br /> The introduction briefly describes the newest Google element, GMail, which is Google's entry to web-based email services, but which more  importantly incorporates its keyword-based search algorythms with email text to link sponsored ads to individual email transmissions. This promises to be a major new business model. That dovetails well with Google's recent IPO - a new investment opportunity projected to be worth multi-billions of dollars.<br /><br /> The book has five parts including sections on search techniques, Google's image, news, and directory databases, search tools, a special section for webmasters, and an appendix. The search sections describe basic and advanced searching and how to interpret results. A later section covers Google Groups which are databases of newsgroup entries, modeled after the defunct DejaNews site, which Google acquired. A little known component of Google is the Answers Site where Google-administered experts answer user-submitted questions, for a fee.<br /><br /> Customizing Google via preferences, installation of the Google toolbar, bookmarklets, and other settings are covered in full.<br /><br /> For webmasters, the  authors describe briefly site optimization for the Google crawlers, how to hide a site from the crawlers, and how to add Google searching to your site. The most interesting sections for webmasters likely are those on the advertising elements, Adsense and Adword. The book describes how the programs work and how webmasters can profit from their use.<br /><br /> There are  times when Google is NOT the right search tool. The authors describe the limitations of Google and where else one can turn to for information.<br /><br /> Like the rest of the volumes in the \\"Missing Manual\\" series, this book provides comprehensive and coherently-written material for helping users obtain the fullest benefit from their applications.timization for the Google crawlers, how to hide a site from the crawlers, and how to add Google searching to your site.

It allows virtually anyone to create an at least decent-sounding musical composition. However, it is not simple and its many features allow for quite sophisticated and complex compositions suitable for professional level use. Yet, Apple provides only minimal on-screen help material.<br /><br /> Hence, the need for a book like Garage Band: The Missing Manual. This is another of the O'Reilly Media Inc. Missing Manual series, and like all the many others I've read, this is a well-written, content-filled volume. O'Reilly should write manuals for creators of all full-featured applications as they have the formula down for doing it right.<br /><br /> This volume is written by David Pogue with his usual combination of substance and style. The presentation is systematic, yet friendly, and with handfuls of wit. The book has two main parts and an appendix containing a mini-music crash course, a menu-by-menu description of Garage Band, and a list of keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br /> Part 1 covers the basics of using and understanding Garage Band - how to install and set up, and how to understand the concepts of tracks, loops, editing, and recording. Emphasis is made of the two types of data input used by the program, so-called digital recordings and MIDI. Each is handled differently by the program and care is made throughout the book to explain how to deal with each. Like the rest of the Missing Manuals he's authored, Pogue uses a hands-on approach to describe and explain how to produce quality output from the program, He weaves music theory concepts with program feature descriptions and gives helpful suggestions to the typical user how best to use the program's features to make music your family will be proud hearing.<br /><br /> In Part 2, Pogue explains how to publish your output and use the results with iMovie, iPhoto, and iDVD, He covers more advanced topics as well, like troubleshooting and extending the program with available plugins and compatible software. References to the more professional level features of Garage Band are noted but not covered in any detail, as most users will never touch these features.<br /><br /> O'Reilly's website ([...]) has tutorial samples and shareware programs to download and use while going through the chapters.

I described the earlier book in a prior review as \\"having everything you wanted to know\\" about the iPod, its software, and its accessories. It was everything a manual should be and more.<br /> Since then, the iPod has changed - it's now bigger and more capable, has newer and better software, and has been joined by the iPod mini. This new edition of \\"iPod and iTunes\\" is bigger, updated, and improved as well. It still is everything a manual should be and more. It has everything you could possibly want to know about the iPod universe, circa May 2004.<br /> For example, Apple bundles a set of earphones with the iPod which are described as noticeably better than most. The book reveals that the Apple speakers use neodymium transducer magnets, described by Apple as five times as powerful as conventional aluminum or cobalt used in cheaper units. That material is a rare earth metal, atomic #60. Not every resource would have that depth of description or explanation!<br /> In its sixteen chapters and 349 pages (including index), the book updates the original by describing the latest iPod hardware and available accessories. It details the features of the latest iPod, iTunes, and iSync software, both Mac and Windows versions. Regarding nearly all its topics, the book makes every attempt to cover both the Mac and PC variants, including the PC-specific Music Match Jukebox software included as an alternative to the PC version of iTunes.<br /> Even if you don't have an iPod yet, you still will have a great manual for the iTunes software which has more features than previously and includes the iTunes Store  features.<br /> From learning how to maximize and/or benefit from the iPod and iTunes software, to knowing all the available accessories for the iPods, this book is as thorough and useful as you can get.	2004-07-15

Besides covering the latest and newest features of iPhoto 4 like its Control Bar, speed enhancements, Star Ratings, Smart Albums, and more, this latest edition of the book continues providing practical guidance on selecting and using the latest consumer-level digital cameras and equipment. The emphasis is on providing information and guidance to move beyond mere snapshooting. It does take something more to become able to make quality images, both in acquiring the image in the camera and processing it afterwards. And, of course, having quality images is not of much use unless one knows how to store, display, and distribute them to friends and family.<br /> In five parts covering digital cameras and photography subject items, iPhoto basics, creating and producing photo projects, advanced iPhoto tips, and troubleshooting, the authors provide all the guidance an amateur or advanced amateur needs for shooting, editing, and sharing digital photo resources.<br /> New sections of the book include how to upgrade from iPhoto2 to 4, how to maintain and upgrade photo libraries and a special section on camera-phone photography.<br /> This is an excellent volume and value for beginner to advanced amateur digital photographers.	2004-07-15

These scripting applications can provide customized information pages, shopping carts and content-management systems, and user-influenced web experiences. While \\"old-fashioned\\" static sites and pages still have their place, dynamic content sites are becoming more and more prevalent, primarily due to their obvious advantages, but also to their modest costs. The reason for these low costs is because the software applications are generally free, thanks to the open-source movement.<br /> Apache is an open-source web server application widely used. The most prevalent and preferred scripting application is PHP; MySQL is the predominant database management program. These three  drive the great increase in dynamic content web development. While essentially free, their installation, configuration, and use requires some technical and programming skills and knowledge, but small and medium-size database-driven web sites can be managed by those not expert in programming or database management.<br /> While there is a lot of material available on the Internet about this software and database-driven sites, and a number of books available on these topics, none is as thorough and complete as \\"Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL\\", by Hugh E. Williams and David Lane. This volume is in its 2nd edition and is a 2004 publication of O'Reilly Media Inc. The book presents an overview of dynamic web sites using open-source software and relates the principles behind generating dynamic content with database applications. The focus is on PHP, the scripting language, and MySQL, the database management software.<br /> As befits a couple of university-associated authors, the book reads much like a college textbook. The twenty chapters include an introduction to PHP, SQL (Structured Query Language), and my SQL, covering PHP v.5, the very latest version and MySQL 4.1. The PHP chapters describe the components of the language and its syntax, variables, conditions, loops, arrays, functions, types, and more. The SQL and mySQL chapters cover database basics, tables, queries, and functions. All this material is presented systemically and thoroughly.<br /> The thrust of the earlier chapters is to prepare for the comprehensive web example of \\"Hugh and Dave's Online Wines\\" site. That site is constructed from the component materials covered individually in the prior chapters - how to manage customers, creating a shopping cart, dealing with orders and shipping, searching the inventory, and authentication of buyers. There is a lot to developing a medium-sized site like this, but everything one needs to know is described and explained as the book progresses.<br /> Extra materials are included as well, including information on PEAR, which is the repository of PHP extensions - script additions which are additional functionings to PHP, or are pre-made containers of code to be used modularly with your existing code; an introduction to object-oriented programming in PHP 5; a chapter on error handling and reporting , including customized reporting; a chapter on the mixed usage of Javascript and PHP; and an important chapter on security of scripts and databases.<br /> All this includes access to the code snips at a website maintained at O'Reilly for downloading.<br /> For intermediate level developers, this is a worthwhile resource.s describe the components of the language and its syntax, variables, conditions, loops, arrays, functions, types, and more.

While \\"Pocket Guide\\" is a basic introduction to digital photography, \\"Hacks\\" is a collection of real-world tips and solutions to everyday problems encountered by digital photographers. It is another addition to the growing set of \\"Hacks\\" books published by O'Reilly Media.<br /> The 100 tips and tools are organized into 8 chapters covering camera attachments, daytime and nighttime photo secrets, flash photography, photo projects, computer-based photo processing and organizing, and a special section on camera-phone photography. A number of hacks cover traditional photographic techniques not new to digital photography but useful to any photographer who wants to improve one or two steps above mere snapshooting. The bulk of them, however, relate specifically to the new digital photography world. The most interesting are those pertaining to camera-phones which have outsold regular digital cameras in 2002. The author demonstrates how to get the best use out of camera-phones despite their limitations in resolution, power, and features. Hack #75 explains that the prime value of camera-phones is in their immediacy allowing unique opportunities to obtain images. This hack reinterprets the traditional photography maxim that the \\"best camera\\" is the one you have in your hand when a special event is occurring.<br /> Hack #79 cleverly shows how one can communicate in a foreign country by displaying pre-loaded images in your camera to the natives in lieu of learning and speaking a foreign language. Everyone will understand the meaning of the photos. Load up your disk with images of toilets, taxi cabs, and cheeseburgers! #83 discusses how to set up and run a photo mo-blog - which is the mobile version of a traditional blog site. Portrait-taking amateurs will learn how to improve their people shots with pro-style lighting effects (#41-43) and Photoshop manipulations like whitening teeth and eliminating red eye and skin blemishes (#16, 69-70).<br /> Learn how to add music to movies and slideshows (#61) and analyze meta-data (EXIF format) contained in most digital photo formats (#28).<br /> This book doesn't have the natural writing flow of Mr. Story's \\"Pocket Guide\\", as the Hacks were contributed by a large handful of experts, but it is a nice resource for those many digital photographers who need guidance or inspiration in using their cameras.s like whitening teeth and eliminating red eye and skin blemishes (#16, 69-70).<br /> Learn how to add music to movies and slideshows (#61) and analyze meta-data (EXIF format) contained in most digital photo formats (#28).<br /> This book doesn't have the natural writing flow of Mr. Story's \\"Pocket Guide\\", as the Hacks were contributed by a large handful of experts, but it is a nice resource for those many digital photographers who need guidance or inspiration in using their cameras.	2004-07-06

It is a worthy successor to Danny Goodman's classic of 1993 (updated in 1998), and is a current update, one which encompasses Mac OS 10.3 and Applescript 1.9.2.<br /> The author is Matt Neuberg, an expert in Applescript and programming. He believes that Applescript is entering into a \\"Golden Age\\" after a period of gradual decline. The Script Editor is now a Cocoa application, there is a system-wide script menu in OS 10.3, more Mac applications than ever are scriptable, there is an integration with Unix, and the free Applescript Studio application is capable of creating custom applications with a full Aqua interface.<br /> Applescript is designed for \\"low-end\\" programming but regardless, is not an easy language to learn and use. It may be relatively easy compared to other scripting languages but there is a need for a volume like this to explain how it works and how it allows one to program applications to communicate with each other.<br /> Neuberg writes with a high degree of technical depth and completeness. He covers the Applescript syntax, variables, handlers, objects, properties, and the like in a thorough manner. Neuberg maintains a focus on Applescript itself and not on how to use it. There are examples of use, of course, and guides to its use, but the book is designed to teach and document the language itself. The most informative material is combined in the chapter on \\"Dictionaries\\". There are indexed catalogs contained in all scriptable applications which provide syntax guides, vocabulary, and other important data for use by Applescript. Dictionaries can help guide one through programming that application.<br /> Sometimes the presentation is much like a script itself, dense, logically rigid, and inelegant. Of course, the subject matter is not meant for beach reading. Programmers and hard-core Mac users will benefit from the content of the book and likely use it as a regular reference.he content of the book and likely use it as a regular reference.	2004-04-08

Others, however, like motorheads who compulsively tune, torque, and tinker with their souped-up cars, love to open up their Mac, so to speak, to get at the innards. This book is for them.<br /> \\"Running MacOSX Panther\\" is a systematic guide to the core of OSX written, not just for power users, but for those with a compulsive need to know how the Mac works inside-out. It is for those who want master-level knowledge of how the Mac operates inside.<br /> After a short history of the developmentof the Mac operating system, the book describes all the essentials: what happens during the startup and login process; how  files organized and permissions set up; how preferences are maintained and edited; how users and groups are set up and administered, and more. The emphasis is on the Unix underpinnings and use of the command line to view, customize, and control the Mac. There is discussion on how to see and edit hidden files and directories, how to use the Unix \\"shell\\" and text editors, and how to edit Open Firmware - the Mac version of the PC's \\"BIOS\\". You can learn to create a user account for non-human users (not including your kitty!)<br /> The advanced sections discuss the Open Directory, a type of database which stores information about the system and its components, and advanced networking information and options. Journaling is explained and an argument is made why disk defragmentation is not necessary on OSX. It convinced me.<br /> An appendix providing guidance on installing Panther has sections for ordinary users as well as for Mac \\"motorheads\\". The motorheads will enjoy reviewing the list of Boot Command key combinations.	2004-03-03

It updates the contents to cover the new features and elements of OS 10.3, known as \\"Panther\\" which is touted as having 150 new features. I've already described the previous editions as representing the best of software manual writing and this edition continues that excellence.<br /> The format, structure, and graphical features are the same as the earlier editions, although this volume is a bit larger, at 763 pages, including index. All the important and most popular features of Panther are covered comprehensively, including the new Sidebar navigation feature, the Expos&eacute; application \\"launcher\\", FileVault encryption, the return of the Labels feature, and fast-user switching. The new applications are covered here also, like the built-in fax program, iChat AV, and the Font Book font manager.<br /> Pogue is best when he provides power-user tips and discloses hidden or little-known features of Panther. The nearly-obscure ColorSync control panel now illustrates gamut spaces in color profiles, for example, and he describes \\"Pixlet\\", a new video codec which is a lossless highly efficient video compression tool (supposedly designed for use by Pixar employees and associates only).<br /> Other little-known tidbits include descriptions and insights to some of the Developer tools on the XCode Tools CD . There is an OSX version of Simple Text which includes a sound-record feature, not available anywhere else in Panther or in OSX applications, with the exception of iMovie. A special feature is the addition of mini-manuals on Safari and the iLife applications - iMovie, iPhoto, iChat, and iTunes.	2004-02-03

Book Review:  \\"Digital Video Pocket Guide\\"<br />  by John Suda<br /> \\"Digital Video Pocket Guide\\", by Derrick Story, is another in the series of \\"Pocket Guides\\" from O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc. Like the others, it is a well-written, comprehensive introduction to a technical/aesthetic area.<br /> This is a small, pocket-size book of 113 pages, including index, published on bright, glossy paper which provides brightness and contrast for its included photographs and makes it easier on the eyes for reading.<br /> I have been contemplating  investigating digital video myself for some time and found this little volume to be a near perfect introduction for a couple of reasons. First, the substantive material contains about everything one needs to get a start in digital video, from buying a camera, to learning and understanding its controls and features, to using the equipment, and tips on how to get some quality production from the camera. The second reason is the unusual (for a computer book) author's \\"voice\\". Story's style is casual, friendly, clear, simple, encouraging, and even soothing, Imagine attending a 2 or 3 hour presentation by an informed camera salesperson who knows how to produce videos, who has the personality and presentation of Mr. Rogers.<br /> It's the substantive material which is most important however. Story walks the reader through the entire movie-making process, from start to finish. Even technical concepts like \\"black the tape\\", \\"bumping\\", and \\"zebra patterns\\" are made simple and easy to follow.<br /> The book has three parts encompassing explanation of the equipment, how to use it, and how to produce some quality product. There is an appendix of a handful of quick reference tables pertaining to color temperature charts, types of microphones, and other incidental matters.<br /> The best sections deal with learning how to shoot scenes including how to light a scene, and how to prevent wind from ruining your audio. There is a nice 10-step movie production checklist which details all one needs to start and complete a beginner's video project.<br /> For a small volume on a technical topic, this is an unusual good read.re is a nice 10-step movie production checklist which details all one needs to start and complete a beginner's video project.<br /> For a small volume on a technical topic, this is an unusual good read.	2003-09-22

Beyond Apple's traditionally elegant and harmonious hardware-software integration, the iLife programs are brilliantly designed to allow users to easily enjoy important non-computer things in their lives - photos, music, home and family and recreational video, etc. - while benefitting from the enormous background power of computer applications.<br /> With iPhoto2, for example, images (scanned or from a digital camera) can be easily imported  into the computer, viewed, printed, burned to CD or DVD, emailed, posted to websites, or composed in professional quality albums with only a handful of clicks. Other than acquiring the images themselves, iPhoto2 and the Mac can facilitate an enormous depth and breadth of enjoyment of photo images without great effort or computer knowledge. The iLife idea is to have the computer aspects work seamlessly and near sub-consciously in the background allowing the user to enjoy his or her photos.<br /> In essence, Apple has designed and created a hardware-software combination which, in itself, does virtually everything a non-professional needs to fully enjoy photo imaging. All of the iLife applications are designed with the \\"hub\\" concept - put all the tools needed into one easily learned and implemented application; - in other words, think of what people need and give that to them in an integrated and elegantly-designed package.<br /> As easy as the iLife applications are to use, like all computer aspects, ease of use is relative - there is no real \\"easy\\" computer or application -  it's an issue of something only more or less easy to use than another thing. Consequently, there is still a need for focused documentation and instruction to allow users to better and more fully utilize the features and power of the applications. This is where \\"iPhoto2: The Missing Manual\\" becomes useful. \\"iPhoto2\\" is part of the acclaimed \\"Missing Manual\\" series published by Pogue Press/O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. Like all of the other \\"Missing Manuals\\" it is a comprehensive, systematic, well-written paper manual where Apple provides none.<br /> Whether intentionally designed, or not, \\"iPhoto2\\" mimics the \\"hub\\" concept - bringing together into one elegant unit all the information and  tools needed  to productively enjoy digital imagery. \\"iPhoto2\\" contains five parts -  an opening section on how to select and buy a digital camera, and sections on<br />how to use a digital camera, iPhoto2 basics, how to create and produce photo projects like slideshows, prints, web galleries, photo CDs, etc., and a section on how to take advantage of specialized iPhoto2 features like making screensavers and desktop images and using Applescript. Also included  is a separate set of appendices about trouble shooting, a menu-by-menu description of iPhoto2 features and commands, and a small section describing where to find additional digital photo resources.<br /> The trio of authors are David Pogue, noted writer, NY Times computer columnist, and wit; Joseph Schorr, established Macworld writer and author of \\"Macworld MacSecrets\\"; and  Derrick Story, author of \\"The Digital Photos Pocket Guide\\" (which was reviewed here favorably a number of months ago).<br /> This book is structured into two overarching themes - as an iPhoto2 manual and as basic instruction in near-professional quality photography. Overlapping some material from \\"The Digital Pocket Guide\\", part one of this book covers basic digital camera concepts: resolution, memory cards, batteries, controls, etc. It then continues with guides on image composition and tips and tricks on how to obtain good quality photos in a large set of situations: portraits, travel, sports, night scenes, and the like. It does no good to have the ability to easily view, print, and e-mail bad photos. Learn how to take a good shot. These sections of the book will help a lot.<br /> The iPhoto2 parts describe how to get your \\"good\\" images into the application, how iPhoto2 is structured on the hard drive with its designated Library, for example, and its organizing concepts - \\"Albums\\" and \\"Rolls.\\" Other application features like editing, copying, and archiving images are well- explained and detailed.<br /> The most interesting chapters are 7-12 detailing how to get quality and efficient production from the program.Features like the \\"One-click Slideshow\\" and how to make Quicktime movies from a folder of images are highlighted.<br /> All in all, this is another well-done publication from Pogue/O'Reilly.take a good shot.

The Mac's Desktop, interface elements, and operations customarily have been very amenable to personalization, tweaks, and other manipulations. Mac  OSX, however, while still very customizable, is not obviously tolerant of such things. There is, therefore, a need and a place for \\"Mac OSX Hacks,\\" a book designed to show mostly traditional Mac users how to twist and contort their machines to fit their user and operations styles.<br /> The major element in all of this, of course, is the Unix base of OSX which includes the command line, an unfamiliar file system,  permissions issues, and the packing of unfamiliar Unix programs and services into the OS, often in obscure or hidden places. The traditional Mac  user can easily become intimidated by all of this and reluctant to alter much, without guidance.<br /> \\"Mac OSX Hacks,\\" one of a new series of \\"Hacks\\" books published by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc., provides just the guidance Mac users need. A full 100 \\"hacks\\" are detailed in this book, some of which are written by the primary contributors to this book, Rael Dornfest and Kevin Hemenway, each an established writer or publisher of computer-related topics. They are assisted here by a large handful of contributors.<br /> While the hacks are directed mostly at \\"power users,\\" both for substantive matters and  for \\"geeky\\" fun, most of these hacks are remarkably accessible to even non-geeks. Each of the nine topic areas - Files, Start-up, Multi-Media, User Interface, Unix & The Terminal, Networking, Email, Web, and Database, starts out with a non-technical overview of the subject matter containing useful information which helps make the hacks (and the need for the hacks) intelligible and understandable.<br /> Hack #1, for example,  provides a clear description of the user account structure of OSX - why it exists and how it is set up. Relatively simple instructions demonstrate how and why to set up multiple accounts and how to configure them, rename them and delete them, as desired. Other hacks explain what goes on in the background during the start-up process (#12), how to understand the differences in linebreaks among windows/DOS, Unix, and the Macintosh systems (#15);  hack #48  is a very good explanation of the Terminal and what it is used for, including explanation of the most useful Unix commands. Hack #2 describes the various backup options for OSX, including reference to available freeware and shareware programs, as well as the built-in Unix applications.<br /> All of the hacks are written with a no-nonsense, hands-on approach. Each is short and can be read in a few minutes. Even some of the  Unix hacks are easy to do.  One can learn how to open the contents of an OSX application?s \\"package\\" where one can hack revisions to application graphics, icons, and other resources, similar to what power users did with ResEdit to pre-OSX resources (#11). Hack #53 explains how to use the built-in Unix maintenence applications, like cron to perform tests and repairs using the command line.<br /> A number of these hacks, even the ones requiring use of the command line,  are amazingly accessible. For example, there is a 10-page hack (#23) on how to make your own documentary using iPhoto; #26 describes how to set up and run your own web radio station (14 pages); #78 describes how to setup a domain name service and create e-mail aliases; #85 tells how to set up a web server with the built-in Apache web application. #94 shows how to install a MYSQL database setup.<br /> These hacks are written so clearly and concisely that I expect I will try some of them myself, and I am neither a Unix or a Mac geek.why to set up multiple accounts and how to configure them, rename them and delete them, as desired.
