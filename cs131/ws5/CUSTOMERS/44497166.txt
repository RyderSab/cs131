Clearly, whether we want to admit it or not, the United States is an empire.  And that's not such a bad thing, Kaplan argues. <br /> <br />For this book (evidently the first in a series on the American military), Kaplan has traveled the world in order to \\"understand the mechanics of America's security commitment,\\" visiting the major installations of the American empire (Iraq and Afghanistan) as well as some of the lesser known outposts (Yemen, Colombia, Mongolia, the Philippines, and the Horn of Africa).  In each locale, Kaplan -- with a traveler's appreciation for detail -- describes the landscape and geography and gives a brief history of the country, its conflicts, and its problems.  By and large, the landscapes are wild and untamed, either barren deserts or overgrown jungles.  These are places, Kaplan says, that \\"were never meant to be countries.\\"   <br /> <br />Conjuring memories of the old frontier army, the troops refer to their stations as \\"Injun Country.\\"  They are blunt, tough-talking men, most of whom have acquired deep knowledge of the countries in which they serve and the people whom they help and fight; it's a knowledge, practical rather than theoretical, that rivals that of PhDs (for whom Kaplan reserves a fair amount of disdain, some of it unwarranted).  Kaplan, the true embedded journalist, goes where they go, eats what they eat, sleeps where they sleep.  He goes on patrol and visits native leaders with them.  The result -- probably the book's best feature -- is a vivid portrait of the lives of the American grunt around the globe. <br /> <br />Except inIraq and Afghanistan, the soldiers in these far-flung locales are involved mostly in humanitarian-type work or related military operations other than war:  building roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals; offering free medical and dental treatment; training native militaries; providing security; and establishing relationships with local leaders and officials.  All the while, they make sure local governments and native militaries get the credit for everything; a constant refrain of the Americans is \\"by, through and with indigs.\\"  Closest to the situation on the ground -- indeed, in the thick of things -- these soldiers are the real policymakers, Kaplan argues, and the American government and military brass would be well advised to give them more freedom of action. <br /> <br />Despite such suggestions and critiques, the book, ultimately, is more descriptive than prescriptive.  Kaplan is more interested in capturing what life is like for the American soldier and marine and how they do their jobs in countries around the world, and less so in offering a defense of American foreign policy.  Kaplan clearly supports imperial-type policies and believes there's no shame in calling it an empire, and he also criticizes aspects of the implementation and administration of that empire.  Nevertheless, the focus here is on the men and their mission, and in that effort, Kaplan succeeds impressively.	2005-10-06

Clearly, too, Maraniss and Weisskopf came away with a strong affinity for Ohio congressman John Kasich, and the story often favors him.  Except for these points, the authors do make an effort to be fair, and the result is an entertaining, though somewhat flawed, look inside the famous revolution  <br /> <br />The subtitle suggests that the book will explain how the revolution got the wind knocked out of its sails.  Before reading, I thought this would focus on the Contract with America -- how it was created, how it fared in Congress, how Clinton reacted, etc.  But in the book's central flaw, the authors focus on issues that are important but mostly tangential to the Republicans' central legislative package.  Yes, de-regulation was an important component of the philosophy at the core of the revolution, but did that revolution's success or failure hinge on reforming OSHA or the school lunch program?  I'm not convinced.  After all, much of the Contract passed Congress, some of it became law under Clinton's signature, and Clinton declared the end of the era of big government.  Obviously, the revolution was not entirely \\"gagged\\" as the subtitle also says. <br /> <br />The best part of the book by far is its discussion of the budget battle and the 1995 government shutdown.  The telling is dramatic and detailed, a veritable feast for a political junky.  Further, if you want to explain why the revolution sputtered out, it was this -- not OSHA regulations, not the battle over school lunches, not the GOP split over the B-2 bomber.  Not only did Clinton outplay Gingrich and the Republicans, but the Republicans played right into the president's hand, making critical, often hubristic errors, the worst of which was Gingrich's belief that he was a second president.  Gingrich would linger as speaker for another three years, and the Republicans still retain control of the House, but the party, at least in Congress, didn't have the same energy and enthusiasm after that.	2005-09-29

Read this book if you want to know-- <br /> <br />* what it was like growing up in the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies, <br />* what it was like to work at a major news network (CBS) as it made the awkward, transition from radio to TV, <br />* how the White House speechwriting process worked, <br />* what went on inside the Reagan administration, <br />* what it was like to be a woman in a field dominated by men, <br />* what it was like to be a working-class, Fairleigh Dickinson-educated Jersey girl in a town populated by the old boys network and the Ivy League, <br />* what Reagan was like in person, <br />* how elements of the conservative movement fought and cooperated in the White House, and <br />* much, much more. <br /> <br />Having come to Reagan administration from CBS (where she worked for Dan Rather), Noonan spent only a few years at the White House in the mid-1980s -- long enough, though, to write some of Reagan's most memorable and moving speeches, including the Challenger and D-Day speeches -- but she saw, and participated in, so much.  She describes her experiences with wit and humor and candor -- and, of course, the wonderful writing for which we've come to know her. <br /> <br />Despite her own conservative politics and love for Reagan, this is not hagiography.  Even as she stands clearly in awe of the president, he remains a mystery to her, a distant enigma.  She is uncertain whether Reagan's aides are actually manipulating him, or whether it's Reagan who's really doing the manipulating of his aides who seem always to be at odds.  And even as she stands clearly in awe of working in the White House, Noonan is quickly frustrated by the in-fighting among staff members, the bureaucratic fights among departments and agencies.  This is particularly the case with the \\"staffing\\" of speeches, in which each department -- State, for example, and the National Security Council -- reviews a speech and basically tears it apart.  Nor are Noonan's impressions of Nancy Reagan and Maureen Reagan particularly positive. <br /> <br />In short, I think it's fair to say that the book is a classic of the genre.	2005-09-29

Easily, as Steve Neal makes clear in this, his last book, on the 1932 Democratic National Convention.  <br /> <br />Neal paints a rich, colorful portrait of the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing that secured, on the fourth ballot, the nomination for FDR. Had Huey Long's Lousiana delegation not been seated, had a deal with Speaker of the House John Nance Garner not been reach -- had any number of pieces not fallen into place, the convention might have swung in a different direction, perhaps to perpetual candidate Al Smith or a dark horse.  <br /> <br />Neal captures all the drama and suspense as these events unfolded in stifling Chicago. His is a character-based account, which is reflected in the book's organization and which tends to give short shrift to the major issues of the day, like Prohibition (whether to repeal) or foreign policy (whether to pursue Wilsonian internationalism). While the reader probably won't walk away with a full appreciation of the issues, he will certainly have a vivid picture of what these men were like and how they acted. The book is worth reading for that reason alone.	2005-09-06

For all his power -- or perhaps because of it -- Pablo makes foolish mistakes that turn him into the most wanted man not just in Colombia but in the world.  <br /> <br />At this point, the United States (having in 1986 declared drug trafficking a threat to national security) becomes more heavily involved, sending CIA and Delta Force teams to the country to assist Colombian police forces. The US contingent assists heavily in intelligence gathering, particularly in monitoring Pablo's communications, but beyond that, the US's role remains uncertain. Did US agents play a role in killing off Pablo's thugs? Did a Delta Force sniper even kill Pablo himself? No one knows (or is willing to admit) for sure, although Bowden leaves the door open.  <br /> <br />From remote South American villages to the halls of power in Bogota and Washington, this is a gripping account. It is Tom Clancy's Clear and Present Danger in real life, and Mark Bowden excitingly tells the tale.	2005-09-06

Tuchman has an eye for detail and drama, both of which pervade the book at every turn.  Her descriptions of notable people are memorable, ensuring that the reader will always think of them when they think of that person.  To wit: <br /> <br />Of Leopold II:  \\"Tall and imposing with his black spade beard and his aura of wickedness composed of mistresses, money, Congo cruelties, and other scandals . . .\\" <br /> <br />Of Joffre:  He \\"looked like Santa Claus and gave an impression of benevolence and naivete.\\" <br /> <br />Of Kitchener:  \\"He looked like a Victorian image of Richard the Lionhearted, except for something inscrutable behind the solemn blazing eyes.\\" <br /> <br />Of Crown Prince William:  \\"At thirty-two, the imperial scion was a narrow-chested, willowy creature with the face of a fox . . .\\" <br /> <br />The list could go on and on. <br /> <br />After the first chapter sets the stage with the 1910 funeral of Edward VII, Tuchman divides her narrative into three parts:  Plans, Outbreak, and Battle.  In Plans and Outbreak, she shifts from capital to capital -- London, Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg, and Brussels -- and describes how the powers prepared (or didn't) for war, focusing on their plans for mobilization and, in the case of France and Germany, on their famous war plans, the Schlieffen Plan and Plan 17.  Indeed, the rest of the book is essentially a study of how those two plans were executed and how, ultimately, both failed and produced the four-year-long stalemate of trenches, attrition, and death that followed August 1914. <br /> <br />Compared with the masterful whole, nearly any flaws seem miniscule, and I almost hate to complain, especially since none changes my overall opinion of the book.  But . . . I was mildly disappointed by the Outbreak part;true to her focus on the month of August, Tuchman basically ignores the month between the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the outbreak of war.  Those details are not essential to her story, but they would have given the reader a fuller understanding of exactly why it came to pass that a Balkan conflict led to Germany fighting Russia and France.  And the work could have benefited from better maps, which are helpful only in gaining a general sense of events. <br /> <br />Still, the book is a classic -- perhaps not as a historical source in the academic sense, but definitely as a well-crafted, dramatically told story . . . and also as a lesson in the follies of mankind.	2005-08-25

Certainly, his cast is a diverse and interesting one, and each person makes for a great story.  But it is hardly representative:  not everyone is a three-sport athlete with a handicapped brother, or a Prom Committee chair with a heart problem, or an outgoing young politico, or an Eagle Scout with cerebral palsy and a strong Christian faith, or a teenage parent, or a stunningly attractive girl with a Corvette.  Where are the middlers who constitute the majority of most high schools, or even the Math Club and AP types?  It just didn't seem as though we were getting the complete picture. <br /> <br />The book also suffers somewhat because it ends without getting the kids' opinions on the prom:  how it went, what they thought of it, whether it was what they expected, etc.  The whole narrative leads up to, and climaxes with, the prom; then it concludes with highlights of post-prom activities on the Jersey Shore and where-are-they-now updates.  Nowhere do we really get their impressions of it all. <br /> <br />(Bamberger also commits the common error of calling The Who's \\"Baba O'Riley\\" \\"Teenage Wasteland.\\") <br /> <br />But despite that, I liked the book quite a bit -- loved it, in fact.  Bamberger writes with style, creating all the drama and emotion of high school.  The pages on the death of Mike Kosmin are among the most achingly poignant I've ever read, and the chapter on the prom itself conjured not-too-distant memories of my own (not at Pennsbury), without giving in to sappy nostalgia and sentimentality.  I finished feeling as though I had just spent a year at Pennsbury, walked the halls with these students, and went to the prom with them.  It's a fine book.  Bamberger and Pennsbury should be proud.	2005-06-02
US	44497166	RIISWZ56DW3S7	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	5	4	5	N	N	unforgettable	David McCullough strikes again and achieves yet another triumph of great storytelling.  In his latest book, he recounts the pivotal year 1776, which we usually remember (if at all, sadly) as the year of the Declaration of Independence, a year of auspicious beginnings.  Contrary to popular memory, those months were bleak and dark; at times, the new country was inches and minutes from defeat.  After a victory of sorts in Boston, where the Americans seized Dorchester Heights and forced the British out of the city, George Washington and his army moved south to New York.  Today, few know of this important phase of the Revolutionary War (hopefully, this book will restore the battles at New York to their rightful place among Bunker Hill and Brandywine), which witnessed the nadir of the American effort.  After a series of defeats (hastened or worsened, in some cases, by poor decisionmaking by Washington), a battered and broken Continental Army retreated into New Jersey.  There, around Christmas, they scored victories at Trenton and Princeton, reversing the decline and, if not quite turning the tide, then ensuring that the Americans would fight on. <br /> <br />This isn't a groundbreaking book; McCullough turns over few new stones and offers few new explanations.  But that's not what he does, even though he always does impressive research.  What he does do, and does very well, is take history and craft it into a riveting, engaging narrative.  Aside from some stray \\"how about that\\"s, I didn't find out much that I didn't already know (that's probably unfair:  I majored in history), but I did come away with the story of 1776 etched into my brain in a way it never was before.  McCullough's telling of this familiar story is utterly unforgettable.	2005-06-02
US	44497166	ROPSXFQDFQHC9	0312422156	298109609	Middlesex: A Novel	Books	5	4	5	N	N	a modern classic	Without risking overstatement, I think they'll be reading this book in college literature classes for decades to come as an American classic.  For certain, it's well-written and carefully constructed, but a classic has something more, something deeper, something almost ineffable.  When you finish a classic, you simply know that what you've just read isn't just good but great, isn't just great but classic.  I had that feeling when I finished Middlesex. <br /> <br />The book is amazingly rich in every way, and there's so much one could discuss.  The narration, for example:  whether Cal/Calliope can be trusted as a narrator, or how much he has made up or embellished.  Or the numerous mythical allusions that add to the book's epic nature.  In its look at modern American life and the American \\"experience,\\" the book is sweeping and grand -- from immigrants to teenagers, Greeks to African Americans, Islam to Orthodox, working class to upper-middle class, birth to death, family to friends.  It spans the Great Depression, World War II, the race riots and counterculture of the 60s, and Watergate -- and even extends, with less detail, into the present.  <br /> <br />At its core, the book is largely about identity:  where do we come from, who are we, and why.  Do we have to be the way we are?  To some extent, yes.  Because of genetics, Cal can't be anything but a hermaphrodite.  Because of family, history, and tradition, he is -- and can't avoid being -- Greek.  But neither DNA nor upbringing need be constrictive.  Born with male proclivities but raised as a girl, Cal chooses to be a man.  Raised in a fairly traditional, conservative family, he blazes his own unique path, entirely his own but never entirely shorn of his past either.  The implications are universal, even if we don't share Cal's genetic abnormalities. <br /> <br />I have no complaints about the book.  I have a very, very minor quibble with Cal's brother's name, Chapter Eleven.  The running joke is never explained, though I assume it has something to do with his running the hot dog stand company into the ground.  It was the only thing in the book that struck me as strange -- and that's saying a great deal for a book in which there is so much one could consider weird.  Parts were (necessarily?) racy, but on the whole, it was tastefully done, with nothing over the top.  Somewhere around page 400, the book felt as though it was dragging just a bit, and I started to think that maybe some of the reviewers were right and the book was too long.  But the end snuck up on me, and when I finally finished, I wished there had been another 500 pages.	2005-03-28

That's simply not what he does.  But what he does do -- and does extremely well -- is approach battles from a thematic perspective and link them in intriguing, insightful ways, usually in light of Western culture broadly conceived.  His Soul of Battle and Carnage and Culture followed this approach.  In this book, Hanson uses three battles (Okinawa, Shiloh, and Delium) to argue that war has broad, far-reaching consequences on culture and society, often decades and centuries after the event itself. <br /> <br />By far, his discussion of Okinawa is the book's most interesting chapter.  The Japanese suicide attacks during that battle resonate loudly in our own time, and Hanson connects such attacks, as well as the responses to them, to the modern-day variety.  Debates about using the atomic bombs are always fascinating; Hanson makes a fine contribution.  Moreover, Hanson's introduction about his namesake uncle who died on Okinawa makes for great reading and drives home how battles affect us in sometimes strange and surprising ways. <br /> <br />But the rest of the book has much to offer as well, especially in the realm of what ifs (e.g. what if Socrates had died at Delium?  what if Albert Sidney Johnston had not died at Shiloh?).  I highly recommend it.	2005-03-28

Mary Roach must have missed that memo.  (Not that she's necessarily impolite; she's just willing to go where few others dare.)  This is a good thing, for she's put together a fascinating book. <br /> <br />We all have preconceptions about what happens when we \\"go,\\" but Roach has vividly captured the decay in descriptive detail, giving macabre shape to our imaginations.  And not only does she describe how the body breaks down after death, she also reports on how bodies are \\"used\\":  in medical school anatomy labs; in automobile crash tests; and in forensic studies of rates and stages of decay (at the \\"Body Farm\\"), to name but a few.  Roach also explores embalming and cremation, as well as some newer, more experimental methods of disposal and burial, such as breaking bodies down using high-pressure chemical baths and using bodies as fertilizer (which may be taking hold in Scandinavia). <br /> <br />Roach writes with seriousness but also with wit and humor appropriate to the topic.  The book loses a considerable amount of steam as it progresses and moves away from the cadavers themselves into the realm of applications and debates.  The first chapters are by far the most vivid, the most riveting, and the best.  But nevertheless:  highly recommended.	2005-03-28

Nevertheless, the novel is still worth reading. <br /> <br />On a stylistic level, it's difficult to figure out what the book is.  To be sure, it's a novel, an embellished, woven-together story based on historical events.  Liberties were taken.  Words were put in people's mouths.  In that sense, the book is fiction.  But it reads much like a history book (complete with a chart of US-German rank equivalents) and, indeed, seems to have been researched like one.  Ultimately, then, it's an amalgam, and I think that's the point:  that the story of Oskar Schindler as we know it today is part history and part fiction, a strange brew of fact and myth. <br /> <br />At the core of the book is an exploration of good and evil and that gray area in between.  Oskar Schindler was a morally flawed man who cheated on and ignored his wife and for whom the bottom line often outweighed morality, as in joining the Nazi Party to advance his business interests.  But at the same time, it was his success as a businessman and his ties to Nazis that enabled him to stay in business, to save himself from prosecution for certain \\"crimes,\\" and to save the Jews that he did -- and saving them was a highly moral act. <br /> <br />Keneally writes extremely well and creates near-perfect metaphors.  Just to cite one example, his descriptions of Auschwitz are especially stunning and apt:  \\"It was a phenomenon.  The moral universe had not so much decayed here.  It had been inverted, like some black hole, under the pressure of all the earth's malice.\\"  Quite so. <br /> <br />It's a worthwhile and memorable read, even if you've seen the movie.	2005-03-28

I'll say simply that Sammon's book complements Woodward's very nicely -- and that Sammon is a far better writer than Woodward.  Sammon has an eye and ear from the dramatic and tells a much better story.  Indeed, it is riveting. <br /> <br />Sammon covers the Bush presidency from summer 2002 until spring 2004.  His primary focus is the war in Iraq, from Bush's decision making and presenting the case for war to the early conduct of the invasion.  He covers all the major details of the Iraq War, including the day and moment Bush made the decision to invade Iraq (afterwards, he went outside on the White House lawn to reflect).  The auxiliary details are here also.  For example:  the story of the president's Thanksgiving 2003 visit to Baghdad (which is downright gripping) and the May 2003 trip to the USS Lincoln, where the \\"Mission Accomplished\\" banner was hung (by the way, Sammon doesn't let this pass uncritically).  <br /> <br />Politics is a backdrop, particularly the 2002 midterm elections and, to a lesser extent (despite the mention of John Kerry in the subtitle), the early months of the 2004 presidential race.  Sammon's discussion of the 2002 elections is especially interesting.  He provides a great description of the notorious Wellstone memorial service/rally that turned the tide in favor of Republicans in Minnesota and perhaps nationwide.  Another Democratic misstep that year was Tom Daschle's mismanagement of the debate and vote on the Iraq resolution; according to Sammon, Karl Rove couldn't believe that Daschle fumbled so badly and handed the GOP such a gift. <br /> <br />Another backdrop to the Iraq story is the media:  how it got so much about Iraq wrong and how it was frequently biased against Bush and his administration.  The second charge -- it's difficult to refute Sammon's quotations on this -- is an old one and not as interesting as the first.  The press was wrong about a string of things in Iraq; for example, many in the media declared that US troops were \\"bogged down\\" a week or ten days into the war, when in reality they had advanced so quickly that they had to stop and let the supply lines catch up.  <br /> <br />All in all, it's a thoroughly engaging read about a critical period of recent history.	2005-03-15

He perfectly captures the spirit, mentality, and consciousness of Ken Kesey--who seems more contrarian than psychedelic--and his Merry Pranksters, from their wild clothing to their psychedelic trips on acid.  And it's funny, too, full of great episodes.  Like when Kesey speaks at an anti-Vietnam War rally and shows up in militaristic regalia--and the whole rally just dissipates.  Or the party with the Hell's Angels.  Or when the Pranksters visit the estate where Timothy Leary is experimenting, meditating, and holding forth--Leary's group takes everything so seriously, they seem drab, gray, and mundane next to the neon-like Pranksters.  If the mainstream was, as Wolfe writes, \\"poor old Formica polyethylene 1960s America,\\" then Kesey and the Pranksters represented \\"the neon of 1960s electro-pastel America.\\"   <br /> <br />It's also a hoot to try to picture straight-laced Wolfe mingling with these hippies and acid-freaks.  Of course, he was younger then, but somehow, I think he fit in about as well as he must have when visiting colleges for his latest book.  More power to him.  For in interacting with and observing individuals and their groups, he writes masterpieces, of which this must be one of his best.  It's a rollicking good read.	2005-02-17

For starters, if you're looking for an intense, gritty, in-your-face account of combat, this isn't the book.  Almost half the book passes before Exum gets to Afghanistan.  Until that point, it's his life story, his training, the first months of his service with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, NY.  And it's a story in which he constantly and annoyingly drops the names of books and authors he likes.  In the book's first forty pages, we hear of Walker Percy (twice...and twice later in the book), Don DeLillo (also twice), Nabokov, Tolstoy, Plato, Aristotle, Derrida, Foucault, Marx, Somerset Maugham, and Immanuel Kant.  He's entitled to read and mention whatever he wishes, of course, but it put me off somewhat.  Thankfully, he abandons the habit after that, except for a handful of references throughout the rest of the book. <br /> <br />Perhaps a man who leads other men in combat has a right to puff his chest out a bit more than the rest of us, but Exum toots his horn a bit too loudly at times.  Like the literary references.  Or the academic achievements.  A particularly galling example comes when he writes, \\"My leadership style has been validated time and time again, both in training and in combat.\\" <br /> <br />Exum also, at times, exhibits a surprising naivete, or at least an apparent naivete.  In the wake of 9/11, he admits to being disturbed by Ann Coulter's notorious (and rightly criticized) remarks about invading Muslim countries and converting them to Christianity.  \\"In that environment,\\" he writes, \\"I felt genuinely sorry for the Indian people who operated the Dunkin' Donuts on my way to work.  I think they were Hindu, not Muslim, but I knew such subtle differences wouldn't matter to an angry populace.\\"  In all fairness, Exum can't be called a lefty, especially not when he calls the 60s generation the \\"draft-dodging generation.\\"  But why single out Coulter's remarks for scorn?  Isn't the rhetoric of the terrorists infinitely more frightening?  And what of the words of liberal pundits who blamed America and boasted of their unwillingness to fly the American flag?  Later, near the end of the book, Exum writes, \\"Our nation was forced into war on September 11, 2001.  When we decide to stop fighting, though, is another matter.\\"  When we DECIDE to stop?  Well, maybe he has a point:  we'll decide to stop fighting when terrorists and the regimes that aid and abet them are--through whatever means--neutralized. <br /> <br />But whatever my, or your, opinion of the book, Exum deserves our respect, and he's eminently entitled to his opinions.  For he was there, on the front lines in Afghanistan, leading his platoon, fighting for his men, fighting for us.	2005-02-17
US	44497166	R265A9ADT46AKL	0394747909	190968724	Huey Long	Books	3	27	35	N	N	detailed but fairly uncritical	This lengthy tome is a fascinating read.  Williams captures the Kingfish in all his colorful glory, from his early days as a salesman to his law career (championing, of course, underdogs), from his years on the Louisiana Railroad Commission through his governorship to his time in the U.S. Senate.  Long was clearly a talented politician, and one gets the sense that he would have been a powerful figure in Louisiana even had the Depression not come.  But Long was able to use the economic woes to increase his standing in the state, to flesh out a very progressive agenda, and to gain national prominence.  There is at least mild reason to suspect that had he not been assassinated in September 1935, Long could have given FDR a run for his money in 1936.  Williams overstates this case and understates the pure political savvy of Roosevelt, who played a nice game of \\"triangulation\\" by adopting some (though never all) of Long's positions and sapping some of his support.  (Alan Brinkley demonstrates this brilliantly in his VOICES OF PROTEST.) <br /> <br />This points up one of the book's biggest (almost devasting) flaws:  it is overly sympathetic to Long.  Williams tells an amazing story, dropping just the right anecdote at just the right time, and he manages to explain the strange, arcane world of Louisiana politics.  But too often, he refuses to cast a critical eye on the Kingfish.  Sometimes, this takes the shape of the old ends justifying the means excuse:  Huey might have resorted to undemocratic means, but it was mostly forgivable since he pursued noble causes that benefited the poor and downtrodden.  Other times, Williams blames Long's opposition (which he paints as a bumbling bunch of conservative--though, of course, Democratic--fools) for Long's excesses:  since his opponents usually put up weak resistance, if any at all, Long was justified in steamrolling over them.  Until almost the very end, until the evidence becomes overwhelming, Williams refuses to criticize Longfor his undemocratic methods.  He makes the case that power corrupts, but Long became corrupt long before Williams admits he did. <br /> <br />Even so, this is the \\"classic\\" biography of Huey Long and very much worth a read for anyone interested in Long, Louisiana, or the Depression era.	2005-02-09

These three essays are not strictly biographical; Morgan does not sketch out the nitty-gritty of these Founders' lives.  Rather, he takes a thematic, character-based approach to the individuals, using events to exemplify their traits, and uses them to flesh out the different takes on independence. <br /> <br />Of the three, Morgan views Adams most negatively, sometimes portraying him as a man of mediocre talents.  Readers of McCullough's biography might disagree, but Morgan does acknowledge that Adams was a \\"great American\\" (in that he placed his country above all other considerations), who bucked party and popular opinion and refused to go to war with France.  For the aloof Washington, independence was shaped by honor and interest (usually the economic variety); he aimed to give the young country self-sufficience and status on the world stage.  Both Adams and Washington, Morgan credibly suggests, might have lived obscure lives had crisis not forced them to rise above the mundane.  Not so with Jefferson, clearly Morgan's favorite.  Here, Morgan focuses on Jefferson's idea of a continuing revolution:  that is, each generation most free itself from its predecessors.  Jefferson's independence meant freedom from the past. <br /> <br />The book is an interesting, sometimes insightful look at independence and these three men.  It's not groundbreaking work, but it's good work--and surely worth a couple of hours.	2005-02-09

Jack Aubrey's world at first seems foreign and strange:  all the nautical terms, the sails, the masts.  As well it probably should to a twenty-first-century landlubber like me.  But by the end of the book, the world seems familiar, even if the sails and masts don't exactly fall into place in the mind yet (I've still got plenty of novels in which to pick that up).  Aubrey and Maturin are amazingly crafted characters, whom O'Brian sketches brilliantly--even while leaving some areas mysterious for later revelations.  O'Brian's writing sparkles.  To wit:  \\"the grey stench of a crapulous dawn\\" or \\"the indefinable frontier between personal animosity and anonymous warfare.\\"  The stern shipboard discipline, the confinement of the ship, the camraderie among the crew, the uncertainty of combat, the exploits of shoreleave--it's all here.  My heart leapt during the first engagement, when the crew spied cannon flashes across the open sea, followed by the boom of the firing.  This is simply a thrill to read.  I look forward to more drama and excitement in the rest of the series.	2005-02-09

Indianapolis and the Extraordinary Story of Its Survivors	Books	4	1	3	N	N	page-turning history	I first heard about the USS Indianapolis in the movie Jaws and later came across references to it in history books, usually those about the atomic bombs.  It's a gripping tale in itself, and Stanton does it--and the young men who survived the sinking--great justice.  He tries to give it historical weight with some footnotes and light discussion of the sources, but the book is almost pure narrative, which Stanton pens excitingly with a clear eye to the individuals who endured the ordeal of their ship going down and spent days afloat.  It was harrowing:  sharks, no food, no water, few lifeboats, dehydration-induced hallucinations.  And Stanton captures the drama, the fear, the horror--and the joy of being rescued.  Stripped of the (important) controversy about who was responsible for the ship's whereabouts being unknown, this is a story of human courage, plain and simple.  I couldn't put it down.	2005-02-09

He follows Chambers from his Long Island beginnings in a troubled family to his unfinished undergraduate career at Columbia, his years as a Communist writer, his time in the Communist underground, his work for Time, the Hiss cases and trials, and his role in the nascent conservative movement.  At first, the book has a mildly plodding feel, but once Tanenhaus hits Chambers's defection in the late 1930s, the narrative takes off and simply soars.  The immediate aftermath of the defection stands among the most dramatic nonfiction I've read, and the Hiss episodes are deftly retold. <br /> <br />More than a biography of Chambers, this is also the story of mid-twentieth-century America and its internal political fighting about Communists.  What emerges here is a more complicated and complex picture of anti-Communism than popular and academic myth have it.  Chambers, for example, took a neutral stand on Joseph McCarthy, refusing to condemn the senator outright but also not coming out in his corner; Chambers clearly had his doubts about McCarthy--so strong that he was reluctant to join the newly founded (and strongly pro-McCarthy) National Review magazine.  Tanenhaus also illuminates some of the conflicts within the Right.  Unlike others, Chambers seemed to accept the continued existence of the New Deal state, and his scathing review of _Atlas Shrugged_ sparked a backlash among National Review readers and produced a decades-long enmity between Ayn Rand and Bill Buckley.  Neither anti-Communism nor the Right in general were monolithic in these years--far from it. <br /> <br />Beyond all the politics and court cases, this is a profound human drama about telling the truth whatever the costs.  Chambers threw away a lucrative career at Time magazine and personal well-being to testify against Communists in government; his concern about personally damaging people like Alger Hiss only multiplied hisproblems.  Later evidence proved Chambers right, but the damage was done.  To the end, Chambers remained a pessimist, but in that pessimism, he found a kind of hope, and his life today seems not a tragedy but a triumph.	2005-02-08

Bush	Books	2	2	5	N	N	uninformative	This is a collection of ten essays, plus an introduction and conclusion by the editor, about various aspects of the Bush presidency, from an academic perspective.  Such an endeavor is limited from the start:  with Bush still in office and set to continue for another four years, many outcomes and consequences remain to be seen, and there's a dearth of sources--not to mention the fact that the book already seems outdated, despite being published under a year ago.  The result is essays that are mostly objective but also very superficial and \\"light.\\"  Most of the pieces resort to stale, worn-out (though basically true) analyses, such as Bush as hedgehog (versus Clinton the fox) or Bush as essentially having two presidencies, one before 9/11 and another after (this idea appears frequently).  Others state what any mildly informed person knows.  Did you know, for example, that 9/11 changed poll numbers?  The exception is the book's first and strongest essay, which takes a historical perspective and explores the nature of mandates and legitimacy, comparing Bush with other presidents who were initially elected with an electoral but not a popular majority.  Despite that essay's insight, I can't imagine that this collection would appeal even to political junkies.	2005-02-02

Bush).  That Gould starts with McKinley is notable, for historians have tended to place the origins of the modern presidency with his successor, Theodore Roosevelt.  In tracing the development of the presidency as an institution, Gould follows a handful of key themes:  (1) the rise of mass media and its effects on the presidency; (2) the rise of continual campaigning; (3) problem-ridden second terms; and (4) the decline of parties and its consequences.  Only the fourth receives unsatisfactory treatment:  Gould mentions it as a theme and never really follows up on it, and while parties as nominating and institutional forces may have declined with the spread of primaries, they surely play a larger role in today's polarized political atmosphere. <br /> <br />Each president is assessed, and except for the somewhat unique argument for McKinley, the analyses are not surprising.  Gould, for the most part, agrees with other historians' assessments.  Not enough time has lapsed since Clinton, and the chapter he gets is weak; Gould opted to focus on the scandals and controversies.  Most interesting of all, perhaps, is Gould's conclusion that the modern presidency is ill-equipped to deal with the problems of this century. <br /> <br />Overall, a solid overview of the presidency.	2004-08-16

He provides background to the battle, including overviews of Artemisium and Thermopylae, and carefully outlines the competing Greek and Persian strategies that produced the huge naval clash at Salamis.  He then chronicles the aftermath, including the Persians' eventual retreat.  The story is driven by characters, which Strauss wonderfully describes at the opening of each chapter and follows through the work.  Herodotus, since he is the basic source for the Persian Wars, receives nice treatment in the Prologue.  After that, people such as Xerxes, Artemisia, and, of course, Themistocles are vividly described.  Themistocles looms large, as well he should, given his role in precipitating the battle; without that cunning Greek and his ruse, bordering on treason, it's safe to say the battle never would have happened and perhaps a different fate might have befallen the Western world.  And this points to the work's single weakness.  While Strauss makes a convincing case for Themistocles' critical role in forcing the battle, he doesn't really make good on the part of the title that says it saved civilization.  But I'll attribute that to marketing-savvy editors and praise Strauss's work without reservation, for all in all, considering the dearth of sources, he has given us a truly excellent, not to mention vivid, account of the battle of Salamis.	2004-08-16

So I was excited to see this book released but found it disappointing.<br />Montville tries to be too artsy with his style:  one-word sentences, one-word paragraphs, lots of repetition.  For the most part, the prose is readable, but it clashes with the book's subject, who was many things, maybe even a bit of a rebel, but not artsy.  <br />Worse, for a book that approaches 500 pages of text, it is surprisingly superficial.  Williams's World War II service gets a chapter, as does his more eventful Korean War experience; both chapters are thin and barely scratch the surface.  Even the 1941 season (.406!!) gets lean treatment.  I like the parallel he tries to draw with Joe DiMaggio (The Streak!!)--Montville writes, \\"Edge:  DiMaggio\\" or \\"Edge:  Williams\\"--but I wish he would have explored it more.<br />Before the book is halfway through, Williams retires from playing (the chapter on his last game is probably the book's best; Montville nicely captures the atmosphere of The Kid's famous last at bat--and no tip of the hat), and the book then focuses on his marriages, his fishing, his work for Sears, as well as a fair amount of gossip-type stories.  The main character of the second part is Ted's son John-Henry.  At times, Ted drops out entirely as Montville recounts the life and despicable behavior of the son, who used his father as a money-making machine.<br />I finished knowing more about John-Henry than Ted.  Too often, Montville lets his sources speak for themselves rather than crafting a narrative from his interviews.  The end result is a very distant portrait of Williams; we see him mostly and explicitly through other people's eyes.  I'll stick with My Turn at Bat.	2004-06-05
US	44497166	R1LKCOIONFY2L4	0670032999	510215142	Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet	Books	4	16	17	N	N	well done group biography	This is a fascinating book, with a stylistic nod to The Best and the Brightest and The Wise Men, the two best known \\"group biographies,\\" and also to the lesser known and more recent First Great Triumph by Warren Zimmermann.  Also connecting the three is their focus on periods of vigorous foreign policy.  Mann's work fits the mold and easily holds its own against these others.<br />Mann's subjects are the Vulcans, Bush's team of foreign policy advisors who coalesced around his campaign for president in 1998-2000, who have shaped the administration's policies, notably regarding Iraq, but who also have vast experience--often together in groups of two--dating back to the Nixon and Ford administrations.  The six are Donald Rumsfeld; Dick Cheney; Paul Wolfowitz; Colin Powell; Richard Armitage; and Condoleezza Rice.  Their interactions and professional pairings over the years are fascinating.<br />Most of the book is bureaucratic history (so those looking for something else, beware), following these six through decades of government service as they make policy to suit the times, be it the aftermath of Vietnam, the Carter malaise, the fall of the Soviet Union, the post-Cold War world of the 1990s, or the war on terrorism.  Dominating their thinking in each period, Mann argues, is a focus on, probably an obsession with, America's military power--how to increase it, how to keep it, how to use it.<br />Mann tells the story ably and mostly objectively.  Given current events, this is a charged topic, and Mann navigates the waters well, without descending into polemic.  He even manages to avoid the whole \\"neoconservative\\" trap, using the label only for Wolfowitz who alone of the six deserves it and reminding us that most of the \\"neocons\\" supported McCain in 2000.  However, Mann uses \\"conservative\\" too loosely and doesn't bother to define it.  He applies it to both Cheney and Wolfowitz (who at various times is both \\"con\\" and \\"neocon\\"), two very different political animals.  As evidence of Armitage's moderate-to-liberal credentials, Mann cites the deputy secretary of state's adoption of Vietnamese children, as though conservatives don't adopt poor foreigners.  Once or twice, he seems to buy into the idea that Cheney was, at least for a time, running the current administration.  But these are small tics in an otherwise impressively fair book.<BR> <BR>The last part of the book, on current events, loses the tight focus and intricate biographical weaving of earlier sections.  Rather than highlighting the connections among ideas, people, and their effects on action and policy, Mann's discussion of the Iraq War is a mere rehash of events most readers of this book will know well.  But if Mann falls short in this regard (and maybe there's simply not enough information yet for a full treatment), he gives us a solid account of the Vulcans' backgrounds and beliefs, and we can surmise for ourselves their imprint on present and future policy.	2004-06-05
US	44497166	RE1JWQLLBI50H	1594200203	809431414	The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America	Books	3	47	51	N	N	good overview but lacks substance	An avid reader and student of American politics, particularly the conservative movement, I was excited to see this book and hesitate to give it a negative review, since it is so very fair to its subject.  But I found it limited and superficial.<br />First, some good points.  The book treats conservatism and conservatives very objectively--without any kind of arrogance or condescension or venom.  They approach conservatism seriously and treat it as a legitimate political philosophy held by intelligent people.  Neither are they uncritical.  Flaws and errors are outlined, and the authors are particularly harsh on John Ashcroft.  The book's main arguments are especially interesting:  that conservatism is what makes American unique; that the process works the other way and American exceptionalism gives American conservatism its distinctive character (and sharply distinguishes it from European conservatism); that conservatism triumphed mainly through demography (specifically the shift west and south), intellectuals/think tanks, and foot soldiers/grassroots; and that the US is and will remain an essentially conservative nation, no matter who is elected in 2004.<br />Ultimately, though, the book is superficial.  The best part of the book is its first section that chronicles the roots of the conservative movement in the 1950s.  Not only highly readable, it gives a very nice summary of that period, touching on the key names (like Kirk, Hayek, Rand, and Buckley) and providing some colorful anecdotes (like Albert Jay Nock's penchant for capes).  Still, those versed in the movement's history--particularly those who have read Nash's superb Conservative Intellectual Movement in America--will find nothing new here and will most likely be frustrated by how much the authors gloss over, such as the fusion of traditionalism and libertarianism (which they attribute to William F. Buckley without mentioning Frank Meyer) or how conservatives shunned the Birchers.<br />After the history lesson, the book discusses the conservative present and future, loses much of its focus, and starts to digress and repeat points that were previously reviewed (including an almost verbatim repetition of a six-point summary of Burke's philosophy).  It is at this point that the authors move from ideas to politics, which is logical since the book is about \\"conservative power\\" and conservatives gain power through politics.  But too frequently, the authors seem implicitly to conflate conservatism with the Republican Party.  Certainly, the GOP is home to most conservatives, and we surely have some form of *Republican* power today, holding all three branches of government and evidenced by the red-blue map, but it is debatable whether Republican governance, and the Bush administration specifically, represents *conservative* power.  This should have been discussed.<br />The book was clearly written for those unfamiliar with the conservative movement and American politics, if the basic descriptions of American government are any indication (did you know each state has two senators and that this gives small, rural states as much or more power than larger states?).  As an introduction, then, to American conservatism and political beliefs, this book is excellent.  And because it is so fair, it is a much-need corrective for those inclined toward simplistic and stereotypical views of conservatism.  But those well-versed in the history and ways of the American Right might want to look elsewhere.	2004-06-05

In the end, the goal of WWII was noble, but the war was as base and destructive as any other; no war can be civilized, however justified it may be.  I understand and believe that.  We absolutely need these warts-and-all histories, but Fussell isn't the first to make the point, and he won't be the last.  I respect and admire Fussell; his book on World War I (The Great War and Modern Memory) is a true classic, one that will surely endure for years and years to come.  But this book is not all that original and is marred by intellectual arrogance.  From the get-go, Fussell explains that he will not--that he refuses to--use what he calls \\"cuteisms\\":  nicknames such as \\"The Big Red One\\" or  \\"deuce-and-a-half.\\"  He believes such phrases \\"adolescent.\\"  But isn't that the point:  that this war was fought by boys, by adolescents?  Did not the boys--except, apparently, Lieutenant Fussell--use such euphemisms, was that not their reality?  I like Fussell's discussions of the war as a crusade, especially how discovering the slave labor and concentration camps was a turning point in making it a moral crusade.  But such sparks of insight do little to redeem the book as a whole.	2004-06-05

Perhaps better than any other living historian (at least that I've read), Bailyn is particularly good at fleshing out themes.  If there's a single historical theme to this work, it's the contrast, and sometimes competition, between idealism and realism, between the lofty ideas that animated the Revolution and putting them into practice in a way that works.  The theme of the book, however, Bailyn's reason for writing it is to encourage a continued examination of the nation's founding.<br />Bailyn opens with an essay on provincialism.  America, he argues, was a provincial backwater, distant from more cosmopolitan Europe but still somewhat connected to continental culture.  Hence, America was more receptive to experimental and new political ideas.  Bailyn uses, to wonderful effect, the homes of the period as well as portraits to highlight these contrasts between Americans and Europeans.  From there, Bailyn offers two essays:  one on Jefferson and the other on Franklin.  In both, the idealism-realism dichotomy is present.  For Jefferson, it is in the sphere of domestic politics and institutions (and, indeed, within his very character).  Bailyn uses Franklin to show how it played out in foreign policy; he also includes European portrayals of Franklin in art to show how he was received there.<br />The fourth essay is on The Federalist, about the context of its writing by Hamilton, Madison, and Jay and particularly about how the papers have been used over the centuries by the Supreme Court--ever increasingly, as it turns out.  (The essay on the same topic in Bailyn's Faces of Revolution is much better.)  The final essay completes the trajectory of the book; where things began with American provincialism, they end with American constitutionalism and related ideas fanning out into Europe (and Latin America).  While this last essay gives the book a nice sense of closure, it is the weakest of the lot and does little beyond drop the names of Europeans who were writing about American political ideas and adopting--or trying to--them in their native countries.<br />Overall, this is a solid collection of essays that contributed to my understanding of the period.  It is a worthwhile read.	2004-04-25

Bloom regrets that and so offers this essay as a follow-up.  His analysis meanders and sometimes suffers from trying to cover so much in so little place.  Some topics that receive treatment:  Hamlet as a play about acting and playing; Hamlet the character as a sort of ambassador of death, as New Adam; the play as \\"secular scripture.\\"  Bloom regards Hamlet as a genius, smarter than any of us who watch the play, smarter even than Shakespeare himself.  Indeed, Bloom never tires of saying so.  (In more than one passage, I had the vague notion that when Bloom wrote about Hamlet, he was writing about himself.) <br />Because it's so short, the book is more interesting than it is profound.  I doubt scholars will cite this book in future criticisms of Hamlet, but it's good reading nonetheless.	2004-04-25

Swofford manages to tell the story of his experiences in Desert Shield and Desert Storm while at the same time using those months in the Gulf to tell his life story, pre- and post-war.  He combines it all in a narrative that is at once poignant and riveting.  In the portraits of his youth, we sense that joining the Corps is almost his destiny--he's the son of a Vietnam vet and the grandson of a WWII vet; he wants to prove he's part of that line, prove that he's a man.  After the war, we feel the aimlessness, the lack of direction, the inescapability of the Marines--it's always with him.  The war itself, though it has moments of fear and danger, is for him and his friends mostly anti-climactic.  Swofford conveys these events and emotions well.<br />Often, though, I got the feeling that Swofford was trying far too hard to write a \\"literary\\" memoir in the vein of a Graves or Manchester or Caputo or O'Brien, to write something more than a simple retelling of war.  The result is writing that's very self-conscious (and maybe that's the point, I don't know); it feels as though he is constantly looking over his shoulder.  <br />The style does have one benefit:  he makes clear that we only see what he saw, that his is only one sliver of the whole story.  And he was a unique soldier, to be sure.  What other enlisted Marine--what other soldier, enlisted or officer, for that matter--read Camus and Homer while in the desert?  I see the point--one captures the existential despair that pervades the book and the other is the classic poet of war--but these references are sometimes annoying, almost as though he's broadcasting his intelligence and uniqueness.  One particularly odd reference was an allusion to Kobe Abe (Kobe who?  yeah, me, too, until I looked him up), when describing the desert sand.  <br />In sum, even if Swofford's style somewhat puts one off (it did me, at least) and tries to be something it isn't or can't, it is a gripping portrayal not simply of men at war, but of what comes before and after.  It deserves a place on the military reader's shelf. (3 stars; worth reading, if a bit esoteric)	2004-04-25
US	44497166	RY3QPLNW4X2V7	0767914007	223826705	Raid on the Sun: Inside Israel's Secret Campaign that Denied Saddam the Bomb	Books	4	10	12	N	N	amazing story	After a somewhat slow start, this book on Israel's 1981 raid on Iraq's nuclear reactor near Baghdad rapidly picks up speed, and the last hundred pages fly, as it were.  Claire begins by setting the stage for the bombing of the Osirak reactor, and he is mostly successful.  This is the only part of the book that drags, particularly a chapter on Saddam Hussein's biography, which I thought was unnecessary.  In place of that section, I would have liked to have seen a chapter on the cabinet debate on whether to approve the raid; most officials supported it, but several key figures did not, and it would have been interesting to see their opposition fleshed out more.<br />Once Saddam's background is covered, we get a glimpse of Mossad's shadowy activities to delay Osirak's going online--such as blowing up core elements in France and assassinating Iraqi scientists, also in France.  From there, the pace accelerates, and we see the Israeli pilots training in F-16s in the US.  We feel the tension build as the raid is scheduled then cancelled, scheduled again and postponed, and finally and firmly set to take place on June 7, 1981.  The mission to al-Tuwaitha, just south of Baghdad, is one of the most gripping narratives I've read in a while.<br />One complaint, though:  the last two chapters were clumsily edited and proofread.  Some mistakes are small, such as saying July when June is meant.  Others are more glaring, like calling the National Security Council the National Security Administration (two very distinct entities) or mentioning that Sen. Lindsey Graham attended a party for David Ivry in summer 2001 when Graham was not a senator until January 2003.<br />Nevertheless, this is an amazing story.  Eight pilots in, eight out, and the reactor was destroyed.  The bombing has been mentioned often this past year, with the tragic death of Ilan Ramon (the eighth pilot in the raid) in the Columbia disaster and the pre-emptive war against Iraq.  The book is both timely and riveting.	2004-04-25
US	44497166	R12ZT1CHIVARSR	0195174070	896801598	The Right Moment: Ronald Reagan's First Victory and the Decisive Turning Point in American Politics	Books	4	1	1	N	N	the right man at the right moment	I have one minor quibble with this book:  its slightly misleading title.  On the one hand, it concisely captures the book's thesis (that Ronald Reagan came at just the right time, capitalizing on political trends over which he had no control) while also cleverly playing on conservative-right.  But on the other, I can't help thinking that it was so titled and subtitled in order to advertise its Reagan content and sell more books.  For although this book is about Ronald Reagan and the rise of conservatism, it is equally about Pat Brown and the decline of liberalism.<br />Nevertheless, this is a solid book.  It isn't extraordinarily or imaginatively written, but it flows and reads very, very well, especially for an academic-type work.  Dallek treats all sides, left and right, fairly and objectively, criticizing and praising both as necessary.  The book takes us into the rapidly changing world of the mid-1960s, where things were tamer than 1968 but hints of what was to come were evident.  Vietnam was only beginning to rise as a divisive issue, and in 1966, it divided the Democratic party and hurt Brown.  The Free Speech Movement at Berkeley didn't reach the levels of chaos that would reign in later years, but it was enough to make Brown look like he didn't have control over the state university system.  Race still seethed, with fair housing a major issue after 1963-64, and again, the left split over Brown's handling of it; but worse, the governor pushed a progressive civil rights agenda on a state that wasn't quite ready for it, and the backlash was intense.  Race riots broke out in Los Angeles in the summer of 1965, adding to the issues of race and crime.  All trends seemed to go against Brown.  Events suggested that Brown was an ineffective leader.  The left fragmented.  And the public at large rejected Brown's liberalism.<br />Enter Ronald Reagan, whose skills Dallek does not dismiss, to take advantage of these trends.  He ran a strong campaign that pushed law-and-order issues (united under the banners of morality and the \\"Creative Society\\"), made fewer mistakes than his opponent, and proved to have far more substance and intelligence than detractors had hoped.  Still, argues Dallek, it was largely the collapse of liberalism and the rush of events that propelled Reagan.  Victory was his, and the groundwork laid for what was to come fourteen years later.<br />A wonderfully informative book, this functions extremely well when read in tandem with Rick Perlstein's Before the Storm.<br />(I did find one error.  On page 108, William Scranton is parenthetically referred to as \\"Senator,\\" whereas he was actually governor of Pennsylvania.  A small mistake, no doubt overlooked in proofreading.)	2004-04-09
US	44497166	R218DNSMDLCXWE	0195067142	78132355	With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa	Books	5	11	12	N	N	�kaleidoscope of the unreal�	This is a gripping account of combat on Peleliu and Okinawa during World War II, without embellishment, without literary flourish.  The narrative is simple, unadorned, raw.  Sledge--a \\"fugitive from the law of averages\\" who survived some of the Pacific War's bloodiest battles--doesn't allude to Hemingway or Remarque, doesn't reference past wars (except fleetingly in discussing the martial tradition of the Corps); he's not interested in connecting his experiences to the ancient line of wars and warriors.  Instead, he describes combat as it was, as he saw it and participated in it.  Sledge takes readers onto those bloody islands--the relentless fighting on Peleliu, the stinking hell of Okinawa.<br />Sledge stresses over and over again that war is a waste, \\"a terrible waste.\\"  Young bodies are ripped and torn apart; young men are struck down in their prime and stripped of decades of potential life.  Mentally, it is a waste, too.  Exposed to brutal combat, civilized men quickly become savage themselves and, for example, pry gold teeth from dead--and, on at least one occasion that Sledge mentions, from wounded and still living--Japanese.  There are many other moments throughout the book where the reader winces.  And yet, while war is not glorious, there are qualities that men can show under fire, that shine brightly in comparison to the brutality:  love, loyalty, bravery, esprit de corps, compassion.  Sledge stresses those, too.<br />This is not an antiwar book, though.  Sledge entered the abyss of war, endured hardships, confronted death, saw men torn down.  He knows war is not pretty, not fun, not romantic.  And yet he also knows that it is sometimes necessary and that, as citizens, we must sometimes sacrifice for our country.  He concludes:  \\"With privilege goes responsibility.\\"  So it does.	2004-04-09

He hits all the islands, from New Guinea and Guadalcanal, north to Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, onto Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  In the process, he not only describes his travels but also chronicles his own wartime experiences and gives a bit of the history of the theater (with generous attention given to MacArthur); Manchester's range is as intriguing as it is impressive:  strategy, tactics, philosophy, history, and literature pepper the narrative.<br />If there's one word to describe the book, it's \\"ironic.\\"   From his early, thwarted, incomplete sexual encounters (readers beware:  these scenes, while brief, are definitely NC-17), to his leaving a hospital to rejoin his unit during Okinawa almost certainly to become a casualty (and indeed, he will be wounded badly enough to be sent home), to how the islands have changed or have not, irony pours from virtually every page.<br />Aside from some vague and indecipherable allusions and a penchant for using the Gethsemane comparison (sometimes confusingly), this ranks among the very best war memoirs I've read.  It's of a very different sort than E. B. Sledge's excellent and straightforward With the Old Breed, but it's no less insightful, no less interesting, no less gripping.  I highly recommend it.	2004-04-09
US	44497166	R2L7DPI5PFHU9M	0140288503	189891237	Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War	Books	5	3	4	N	N	an utterly moving classic of men at war	This is a stunning, moving, fast-paced read, and I regret that I waited so long to read it.  But now that I finally have, I can say it is one of the finest works on modern combat I've read.  With admirable humility, Bowden dismisses his own capacity for military and strategic analysis, and this book isn't so much a book about why as it is who and where and what and when and how.  It's an amazing narrative.<br />Bowden takes us into the world of Mogadishu (the \\"Mog\\"), where warlords struggled for control of the city and where mobs roved.  His comparison to the Mad Max films is particularly evocative.  Into that world were inserted teams of elite American soldiers:  the shadowy Delta Force (D-Boys) and Rangers.  At first things go moderately well, and they come within minutes of success.  But once events take a turn for the worse, they do so rapidly, and the fog of war quickly engulfs the fight.  Soon, two helicopters are down, and the soldiers are trapped in the city, left to fight off angry and armed mobs.  They spend a night in the city before being rescued, but not before they took on harsh casualties.<br />I don't think I've ever read a book on military history that so often left me near tears.  The devotion of these men, their courage and heroism (but they're still just men--or, most of them, just boys of nineteen, twenty, twenty-one), their sacrifice, the near rescues and close calls, the deaths, and finally the rescue--it's all highly emotional stuff.  You root for them, know the cause was a noble one, and yet you're unbearably enraged by how these troops were used and abused by their nation.  This is not an anti-war book, nor is it a patriotic celebration of the American soldier.  It is a realistic, brutal look at modern warfare.  It is already a classic.	2004-04-09
US	44497166	ROFYL570FNK57	0809028581	806086708	Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus	Books	3	14	18	N	N	great story but lean on analysis	Rick Perlstein is an excellent writer, and here he tells a great story.  He attempts to capture the general mood of the time and especially the political climate.  This was in the aftermath of President Kennedy's assassination; words like \\"hate\\" and \\"extremism\\" were everywhere.  And even though the Cold War had thawed slightly after the Bay of Pigs in '62, that war was still very much on people's minds, still very much a source of fear.  And that was another watchword for 1964--\\"fear.\\"  DR. STRANGELOVE played on those fears to humorous effect and highlighted the dangers and absurdity of nuclear war.  (As another reviewer has pointed out, Perlstein does, however, spend a bit too much time on an overview of that film, important though it was, and afterwards constantly refers to it.)<br />This is primarily a story about campaign politics, and Perlstein is at his best when describing the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing that made Barry Goldwater the Republican nominee.  However, readers should know that Perlstein focuses on political action and organization rather than on the animating ideas behind the movement.  In general, this doesn't affect the book, but a full appreciation of what people were doing and why requires treatment of the core ideas.  For example, Perlstein devotes much space--and many colorful anecdotes--to the activities of the John Birch Society, the Young Americans for Freedom, and the libertarian Republicans in places like Orange County, California, but we don't really get to see why they were cooperative or antagonistic with each other; and the significance of William F. Buckley's uniting project is lost.  (For a treatment of the ideas, I'd recommend George Nash's THE CONSERVATIVE INTELLECTUAL MOVEMENT IN AMERICA.)<br />I was also disappointed by the absence of any real or substantive analysis.  Besides some general introductory remarks, there is nothing that passes for analysis.  There isn't even a conclusion; the book disappointingly and abruptly ends in midstream immediately after LBJ's landslide.  Thus, the title and subtitle are misleading.  What is the \\"storm\\"--the consequent rise of conservatism and the triumph of Reagan in 1980?  We're never told.  And how did Barry Goldwater unmake the American consensus?  We get some idea of how he disrupted the reigning Republican consensus of the eastern establishment (but we get no sense of the consequences and how this contributed to the \\"Reagan Revolution\\"), and from our twenty-first-century vantage point, we know that many of his ideas are accepted as political orthodoxy today (on the right and left).  But just how this happened is left to the reader and his apparently assumed store of political knowledge.<br />BEFORE THE STORM is more journalism than history, and that's fine.  As journalism, the book is interesting, insightful, thought-provoking, thorough, and objective.  Perlstein takes us into the trenches and shows us what happened in all possible (but not superfluous) detail.  He fleshes out personalities and captures emotions.  In short, he tells a riveting story without bias.  As journalism, as narrative, the book succeeds.	2004-04-09
US	44497166	R318D2TM99G3J6	0940450372	270984535	Flannery O'Connor : Collected Works : Wise Blood / A Good Man Is Hard to Find / The Violent Bear It Away / Everything that Rises Must Converge / Essays & Letters (Library of America)	Books	3	144	174	N	N	brilliant stories in a flawed edition	The stories themselves easily get a five.  O'Connor was a genius, combining her Catholicism, her Southern-ness, and the grotesque in stories that explore the nature of revelation, grace (or the lack thereof), and redemption.  The stories have characters who are often \\"freaks\\"-physically (legless, armless, fat, pock-marked) and psychologically.  Frequently, the stories are violent, shockingly so; and if not violent, then they still surprise or shock us in some way.  My jaw has hit the floor reading each story.  But they are meant to startle us into our own revelation.  It requires patience and careful reading and re-reading to get to the heart of O'Connor's writing, but it's well worth the effort.<br />The collection itself gets, at best, a two.  It is very poorly organized, as others have mentioned.  Rather than a table of contents listing every story, the main table of contents lists only \\"major\\" works-that is, the novels (Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away) and the collections (A Good Man Is Hard To Find and Everything That Rises Must Converge).  To find a particular story, one must either know what collection it appears in or must check separate tables of contents within the book.  I'm probably nitpicking, but it can be frustrating, especially for someone new to O'Connor.  The included essays are O'Connors most well-known and provide important and interesting insights into her writing and themes.  Many of the letters are intriguing, but many others consist of a few lines and are not extremely useful (there's a two-line letter to Walker Percy, congratulating him on an award, which tells us virtually nothing at all; include it in a book of O'Connor's letters but not in a sampling of her best and most important).  Beyond that, the letters are very poorly indexed.  Sometimes, an index entry refers the reader to a page with no reference to the topic; other times, an entry lists, say, two references, whereas there are actually three or four among the letters.<br />It's wonderful to have all this under one cover, but I wish they'd have taken just a bit more time to produce a better volume.	2004-04-09

Actually, it's a political history of the entire year, taking us through the primaries and conventions and campaigns and highlighting the important events and issues that shaped that year's (and beyond) politics.  Gould argues, with moderate success, that the election was shaped the most by racial issues, not Vietnam.  I think that case can be made, especially when the candidates were talking about \\"law-and-order\\" issues (i.e. race riots, urban crime); the presence and performance of George Wallace only underscores the role race played, and after all, this was the pivotal election in turning the South Republican.  Gould, though, slightly overstates the case.  The enduring significance of the election might well be race (and I think so), but at the time, Vietnam was key--for example, in LBJ's decision not to run (to which Gould gives in depth attention but which he seems to attribute largely to Johnson's health concerns).  He also makes a provocative and appealing case that Robert Kennedy's potential for victory, in the nomination and the general, has been overstated by historians and Kennedy supporters ever since his tragic death after the California primary.<br />The book is brief and not deep; it is American Political History 100, maybe 200--not 400.  One gets an overview of the year but not an in depth picture or analysis.  Somewhat detached (which might be a laudable achievement, considering the high emotions that surround the Sixties), it doesn't quite capture the mood of 1968.  It's still a solid starting point and a decent read.	2004-03-04
US	44497166	R2YVO00SR6YJB	1400034183	575332371	Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order	Books	4	5	7	N	N	solid argument, lots of facts, a bit padded	The essay on which this book was based appeared in the journal POLICY REVIEW in the summer of 2002.  Almost instantaneously, it ascended to nearly mythic proportions, getting e-mailed around the country and the world and printed for policy meetings at home and abroad.  Among those who care about such things, it ignited a fire, either positive or negative, but no one could deny it was an important, influential article, having appeared at just the right time and capturing the mood almost perfectly.  Last spring, it was required reading in a course I was taking on international politics; the professor (who was, in lectures, critical of Kagan's arguments) ranked it among other seminal articles, such as Fukuyama's \\"The End of History?\\" and Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations.\\"<br />The argument, basically, is this:  foreign policy differences between the United States and Europe boil down to a matter of who is strong and who is, comparatively, weak.  The United States pursues the policy of the strong--a belief in the necessity of using force, a disregard for international institutions, and a willingness to act unilaterally.  Europe's is the policy of the weak--reliance on international and supranational organizations, calls for respecting international law, hesitation about the use of force.  When the U.S. was weaker, say in the late 1800s, it pursued a policy not unlike what Europe follows today.  Kagan, though, is quick to point out the nuances of Europe's policy, which are rooted in twentieth-century history, especially the last fifty years.  Having been engulfed in two devastating, catastrophic wars, Europeans have seen firsthand the effects of war, and they seek to avoid it at almost all costs; having been tremendously successful in solving the seemingly impossible \\"German question\\" through the EU, they have an almost messianic belief in the efficacy of \\"their\\" way:  integration, sacrificing national sovereignty, etc.<br />Many are quick to dismiss Kagan's ideas, probably without even reading the book, as \\"neoconservative\\" (whatever that means), as part of some shadowy network emanating from the invidiously portrayed PNAC.  But there are substantive points here, backed up by history and current events--arguments that cannot simply be dismissed by assigning a debate-stopping label.  And Kagan even reproaches the Bush Administration for its hard-nosed approach to many issues and concludes his book with a heartfelt call for Americans to attempt to understand Europe and its problems and people better.<br />One more thing:  being the outgrowth of an essay, the book has the feel of being padded--with superfluous facts and repetition.  I think it functions much better as an essay.	2004-03-04

I was thoroughly disappointed.<br />The first part of the book--something like one-third of it--is devoted to the background of World War II in the Pacific.  In a lesson in multicultural political correctness and moral equivalance and relativism, Bradley retells the story of American \\"Manifest Destiny\\" and virtually absolves the Japanese of blame for their war of aggression, attributing their actions to decades of American racism, even going so far as to suggest that the Japanese used American injustices (and there were, indeed and unfortunately, more than a few) to justify their own gross atrocities.<br />Mount Rushmore, he writes, \\"memorializ[es] the chief ethnic cleansers of the West\\" (that is, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt) and \\"honor[s] white supremacy.\\"  Never mind that, following the Revolution, George Washington wrote about the Indian population, \\"The Country is large enough to contain us all.\\"  Ignoring the fact that torture was a two-way street in the conflict, Bradley condemns U.S. involvement in the Philippines after the Spanish-American War by equating it to the wars of Tojo and Hitler.<br />By the time he got to the meat of the story--why I picked up the book in the first place, since I was interested not in the background to the war but in this particular episode of bravery, heroism, and atrocity--I was all tapped out.  It's a good story, and Bradley does it some justice.  But in denigrating the cause and nation these men served, the story is diminished.  By a long shot, the U.S. isn't beyond criticism, but whatever happened to giving a straightforward narrative of events, unencumbered by the baggage of political correctness?	2004-03-04
US	44497166	REBFISQLBJ851	0671869205	680068737	Truman	Books	5	4	4	N	N	finest biography I've read	After a slow start (on the history of Missouri and Truman's lineage there), the book just flows from one episode to the next.  You don't even realize you're reading almost a thousand pages.  It's over before you know it, and you desperately want more.<br />The popular image of Truman is of the simple, humble, colorful man from Independence, Missouri, who took a forceful stand against Communism in a presidency bookended by two wars (World War II and Korea).  As McCullough, in his characteristically beautiful prose, shows, Truman was far more complicated a personage than the simple, homespun, down-on-the-farm character of myth.  <br />Rising to the presidency under perhaps the worst possible circumstances (during the final months of a global war, succeeding a phenomenally popular president who led the nation not only through war but also through economic depression), Truman struggled to emerge from FDR's shadow and chart his own course, which he eventually did but not without occasionally challenging the old New Dealers, with whom he clashed personally even if he did agree with them on policy.  Truman's domestic policies, moreover, sometimes get overshadowed by the events of the early Cold War, causing us to forget that he was a liberal and progressive Democrat who advocated national healthcare and civil rights, among other causes.  We sometimes forget, too, that he (like FDR, although in a different, more subtle style) was a politician, capable not only of strokes of brilliance--such as the innovative Whistle-stop campaign of 1948--but also of nasty rhetoric; he once said that a vote for Dewey was a vote for fascism.  Reading this in 2004, another election year, I was struck by a handful of parallels with the '48 race:  nasty, personal rhetoric; railing against \\"special interests\\" (as ambiguously defined then as now, even if Truman was a true believer in the slogans); labeling Republicans as the party of Wall Street and the rich; and a national array of pundits who were completely wrong.  Some things never change, probably.<br />A truly complex figure, he was sometimes humble, willing to let others take the credit for policies that were his idea, and often not (such as his belief that he could influence Democratic politics after his departure from office).  A great leader, Harry Truman occasionally stooped to low levels of anger and vitriol, penning seething letters he usually never mailed--the notable exception is the rant he sent to a music critic who panned his daughter's singing.<br />McCullough conveys all this in straightforward terms, without frills, without fanfare, which is as it should be, considering Truman.  This is a man and a book for the ages.	2004-03-04

While not written in the jargon of the field, Maraniss clearly approaches the subject of Vince Lombardi from a post-modern point of view.  He opens with a contrived and somewhat galling introduction, in which he explains that he has borrowed the title from another author and uses it (of course!) &quot;ironically.&quot;  At various points throughout the book, Maraniss attempts to &quot;de-construct&quot; Lombardi, which is to some extent the mark of any good biography, but the author takes it too far at times, especially in his frequent references to the &quot;fallacy of the innocent past.&quot;  Moreover, this is not a political book, but because Lombardi was mildly politically active, politics enters the picture.  And a subtle bias pervades Maraniss's discussion of politics.  When lifelong Democrat (but always pretty conservative) Lombardi begins drifting toward Nixon and Republicans in the turbulent sixties, Maraniss attributes Lombardi's conservatism not to a heartfelt belief in those principles but to an inability to cope with rapidly changing times.  The 60s is a favorite topic for Maraniss, as his latest book indicates, but his digressions into the protests, while tangentially important to Lombardi's story (particularly his philosophy of freedom), are overdone.<BR> <BR>Nevertheless, despite those faults, I still give this book a five.  Immediately after that disappointing introduction, Maraniss redeems himself with probably the most stunning first line I have read in any book of nonfiction (and perhaps in fiction, too):  &quot;Everything begins with the body of the father.&quot;  It is a starting point for a discussion of Lombardi's immigrant father, but it brings together elements that appear throughout the book:  family (especially Lombardi's relationship with his son); Catholicism; the physical violence of football.  From his youthful desire to be a priest and his high school and college football career, Maraniss follows Lombardito Fordham and beyond to his first coaching job at a small Catholic high school in New Jersey and to an assistant's job at West Point, under Red Blaik.  It was then to the Giants, where he was an assistant with Tom Landry, and finally across the country to Green Bay, where the legend was born.<BR> <BR>The book is not just a biography of Vince Lombardi; it is a look at American life and culture and at the history of professional football.  It is amazingly written, and the descriptions of football games are wonderful--particularly the Ice Bowl, which another reviewer has mentioned.  Flaws and all, this is a fantastic read.	2004-02-15

I simply could not put it down.  George Crile tells the gripping story of how one congressman, Texan Charlie Wilson, took up the cause of Afghan freedom fighters and escalated American support for them many, many times over.  Because of his efforts, billions of dollars were given to the mujahideen, including high-tech weaponry.  Crile takes us behind closed doors in Congress, where Charlie Wilson wheels, deals, and strong-arms to get funding for Afghanistan; he takes us into the secret world of the CIA, where danger surrounds overseas stations and bureaucratic politics plagues operations.<br />At the heart is a cast of colorful characters, including Wilson and CIA man Gust Avrokotos.  Wilson--a socially liberal, staunchly anti-Communist Democrat from a conservative and religious district of Texas--womanizes, drinks, (maybe) does drugs, is involved in scandal after scandal (including a hit-and-run car accident), and yet is re-elected over and over and singlehandedly secures funding for the freedom fighters.  Avrokotos is the foul-mouthed (he has a sexual analogy for just about every situation), tough-talking son of Greek immigrants from a steel town near Pittsburgh, who joins the Agency in the 1960s and eventually heads up the Near East division, where he adeptly manages the Afghanistan operation.<br />I loved the book, plain and simple, but I did have a problem or two with it.  Crile seems to accept as fact nearly everything Wilson and Avrokotos said in their interviews.  Their accounts form the backbone of the book, and Crile seldom questions their veracity.  More than that, he usually adopts their opinions as his own:  if Avrokotos dislikes this or that CIA colleague, then so does Crile.  Furthermore, while he maintains that supporting the Afghans against the Soviets was a noble cause (I think so, too), Crile glosses over or dismisses the fact that what Wilson was doing was questionable ethically and was quite possibly illegal.  Wilson bullied congressional colleagues, usurped powers traditionally reserved for the executive branch (while at the same time exalting the separation of powers, especially those reserved for Congress), and avoided any sort of oversight.  And yet Crile is harsh--unduly so, I think--on Iran-Contra and paints Oliver North and other participants as fanatics, right-wing zealots, and buffoons.  Certainly, Iran-Contra is more clearly problematic (and probably downright illegal), but to praise efforts in Afghanistan and to find no merit at all with loosely similar attempts to aid anti-Communists in Central America is a glaring contradiction.<br />While this might detract a bit from the book's use as a historical source, it is still a great and rivetting read, full of excitement, danger, intrigue, and suspense.  I highly recommend it.	2004-02-15

For a treatment of the strategy of which the Normandy landings were a part or for what came after (or, for that matter, before) June 6, 1944, you'll need to look elsewhere, for Ryan focuses on the sixth itself and discusses strategic elements virtually not at all (except for some tangential remarks on Germany's strategy for defending occupied France).  But at the level of the soldier on the ground, in the thick of battle, this is great reading.<br />Ryan breaks his book down into three parts:  \\"The Wait,\\" \\"The Night,\\" and \\"The Day.\\"  The first part details the day or two before the invasion, during which the tense Allies finally decided that the sixth and not the fifth would be D-Day and during which things worsened for an already unprepared German army (such as Rommel's departure from the front for a visit home).  After something of an anti-climax on June 5, when the landings were pushed back a day, events accelerate rapidly.  After midnight on June 6 (\\"The Night\\"), paratroopers land behind the beaches.  The Germans were surprised, but the Allied effort was confused and scattered since many paratroopers missed their drop zones by as much as miles.<br />Dawn brings even greater surprise to the German leadership in France, most of whom believed the invasion would come at Calais, when they spy the massive invasion force with its thousands of vessels off the coast at Normandy.  Americans land in the west at Utah and Omaha, while British and Canadian forces land at Sword, Juno, and Gold in the east.  Classic episodes ensue at Utah, where resistance is light and troops under Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., move inland to meet up with airborne soldiers.  Much bloodier combat took place on Omaha, where many Americans fell.  Omar Bradley was on the verge of pulling back from Omaha and re-directing troops to Utah when men of the 1st and 29th Divisions finally gained a foothold and began to break down the Germans' fortified positions and pillboxes.  Meanwhile, to the east, British troops are led into battle by bagpipes and achieve successes.<br />Portrayed mostly through the eyes of the troops, Ryan's account is gripping, engaging, exciting.  For the most part, he follows the American-British-Canadian offensive, but he also gives attention to the German defenders (including a particularly interesting account of a company inside a pillbox).  Ryan captures the confusion on both sides and conveys that things soon fell into place for the Allies while the Germans seemed to fall into greater and greater disarray.  It would be a long fight--another eleven months--until Germany fell, but that struggle began on the Normandy coast on June 6, 1944:  the longest day.	2003-11-28

Yes, Decter's treatment of Rumsfeld is glowing and not always deep; this is not, nor is it intended to be, a work of objective biographical/historical analysis.  It is, as the title says, a \\"personal portrait.\\"  It is \\"personal\\" in that it deals with a person but also in that it is Decter's own portrait--a work by a person who admires Donald Rumsfeld.  And portraits only and quite literally scratch the surface of a person; they can capture only certain details and, if lucky, convey a hint of the subject's essence (not to mention that portraits contain more than a little of the creator).  As a personal portrait, then, this book works quite well, and Decter does capture at least part of Rumsfeld's essence.<BR> <BR>Decter is not so much interested in necessarily explaining why Rumsfeld does this or that as she is in why he became so popular during the Afghanistan War.  To explain this, she chronicles his life--from his childhood outside Chicago to the present, including stops at Princeton, the Navy, Congress, the White House (as head of OEO and Chief of Staff), the Pentagon, and the private sector.  Rumsfeld's unique management style draws from his entire career, but his popular appeal, Decter suggests, results from elements that were present from the beginning and that appear throughout his life:  his midwestern, Middle American values (especially those specific to Chicago) and his old-fashioned manliness.  He is a straight talker, who tells it like it is, in speech peppered with wit and colloquialisms (\\"Gosh!\\").  He exudes the values of the heartland--a family man devoted to protecting family and country.  He seems to be full of vim and vigor.<BR> <BR>I think Decter more than adequately explains why Rumsfeld has garnered celebrity status.  Certainly, 9-11 contributed to it, by bringing war and by making people desire such a leader as Rumsfeld (among others).  But the terrorist attacks and the war on terrorism can't explain everything.  After all, others rose to prominence in the aftermath of 9-11 but didn't gain quite the dimension Rumsfeld did.  So it seems to make sense that something else was at play--his values and manliness, as Decter argues--in generating his \\"sex appeal\\" and popularity.  More in-depth biographies will no doubt follow in the future, ones that will explain why Rumsfeld did what he did and does, but Decter has done good work here, giving us a better picture of Rumsfeld and, indeed, a better picture of ourselves.	2003-11-10

Morris includes some background information, such as his earlier history with the Clintons and his relationship with Trent Lott, but the primary focus is how Clinton won the presidency after the 1994 midterm elections, to many observers, turned him into an apparent lame duck.<BR> <BR>Morris takes great pains to point out that he is (or at least was) an equal opportunity consultant, advising both Republicans and Democrats.  Indeed, when he got his first call from Clinton in 1994, he was working on a handful of Republican campaigns, including Tom Ridge's race for governor in Pennsylvania.  Previously, he had worked for Trent Lott, whom Morris deeply respects, and, surprisingly enough, for Jesse Helms, a job which, not too surprisingly, ended with Morris's being fired.  There's something a shade Machiavellian about this, about caring for victory above all else.  But Morris also goes to great lengths to explain his \\"craft.\\"  It is not simply spin or slander or attack or government-by-polls; rather, it is about issues and substance.  Morris insists that he merely examines a candidates repertoire of positions and, based on polls, picks the ones to emphasize.<BR> <BR>It is an interesting book by an obviously brilliant man.  Clinton's reversal of fortunes between 1994 and 1996 is nothing short of stunning, and much of it was Dick Morris's doing.  That is, until he encountered his own scandal during the 1996 convention.  (Of course, Dick Morris's strategies would continue to reap benefits after he left.)  If there is a negative of this book, it is Morris's constant apologies for his trysts with the prostitute.  It's a refreshing stand--to admit his wrongdoing, apologize for it, and recognize that he hurt others more than he hurt himself.  But it was such a constant refrain in the book as to detract from its overall impact.  Still, the book is insightful not only into the 1996 campaign but also into campaign strategy in general.  It is a fascinating read.	2003-11-10

It is mostly a personal, autobiographical account of his own experiences, rather than an analytical treatment of the business--although he does draw some general conclusions about the field.  The book deals more with personalities than with issues.<BR> <BR>Carlson begins with his largely accidental beginnings in TV--from his first brief appearance during the O.J. Simpson trial (a gig he landed somewhat randomly, by returning early from lunch to the Weekly Standard office) to the phone call during the 2000 election asking him, on the fly, to host a new show on CNN, The Spin Room.  Throughout its life, that show always retained a thrown-together quality to it, with Carlson and Press often relying on gifts to furnish the set.  They never did get custom coffee mugs, and Carlson's final attempt intersected with the end of the show--the promotional department knew of the show's end before Carlson and would not give him the mugs.  From there, Carlson migrated to Crossfire, CNN's one-time premier political show, and watched as it, too, fell, unable to compete with Fox's primetime lineup.<BR> <BR>Carlson despises partisans, whom he differentiates from ideologues.  The distinction is rooted in partisans' blind adherence to the party line, but I'm not convinced that the distinction is an apt one.  He likes people who speak their minds and go out on limbs, who aren't afraid to be outrageous.  Jesse Jackson is a phony, whose phoniness is enhanced by TV.  Al Sharpton, Carlson suggests, can think for himself, even if he is wrong.  Jim Traficant added color when he showed up for an interview drunk and accosted the show's female floor director.  John McCain--whose 2000 presidential campaign Carlson reported and covers extensively in the book--is praised for his never-mind-the-consequences approach to politics, but even the admiring Carlson admits that McCain played to the media.  Bill Press, former co-host of The Spin Zone, comes off as a decent, funny, hardworking guy who loves to eat on the set.<BR> <BR>In general, Carlson seems to believe that TV shapes its &quot;participants&quot; more than the other way around.  Shows certainly are influenced by their hosts, but TV has a way of changing people.  It enlarges not only physical traits but also personalities and idiosyncrasies as well:  everything seems larger on television.  It can give one an inflated opinion of himself.  If a host isn't careful, his larger-than-life, seemingly all-knowing, accentuated personality can seep into his private persona (e.g. Bill O'Reilly, as Carlson posits).  As a career, TV offers an unstable, fragile one that can disappear in the blink of an eye.  Of media bias, Carlson doesn't seem to acknowledge its existence; instead, producers, he says, aren't driven by politics but by polls--the &quot;ideology of the poll.&quot;<BR> <BR>Carlson says nothing earth shattering, nothing surprising, nothing controversial.  He provides little depth on the TV media business or on virtually anything that goes on behind-the-scenes.  Nevertheless, written lightheartedly and humorously, the book will surely entertain media and political junkies alike.	2003-11-03

Having some familiarity with Bloom's ideas and passions, I know this not to be the case; there's always something more to his books.  Still, How to Read and Why possesses that written-on-the-fly quality, and while Bloom's assembly of diverse and interesting pieces of literature is excellent as always, I ultimately found the book to be unsatisfying.<BR> <BR>Aside from some introductory hows and whys, the book never really explains, satisfactorily, how we should read and, more importantly, why.  He speaks of reading to re-capturing irony, of reading to accustom ourselves to change (and especially to the final and universal change), of reading because we cannot hope to meet all people.  This is all true, of course, and the book might have been more successful had he pursued those threads and others throughout the text.  After the introduction, however, Bloom begins his analysis of literature, broken down into sections on short stories, poetry, plays, and novels.  The analyses are often interesting, sometimes wrong (just my opinion...for example, his opinions of Flannery O'Connor and Dostoevsky are severely limited here, as they were in Bloom's more recent Genius; in How to Read and Why, both writers receive similar treatment from Bloom, in the form of D.H. Lawrence's admonition, &quot;Trust the tale but not the teller&quot;), but they are his; they show only one &quot;how&quot; of reading; they are not readily generalized.<BR> <BR>Yes, literature is enriching and enlightening; it enhances the experience of being alive.  The insights it offers are diverse and often debatable.  That's all part of reading's allure.  But too often Bloom allows his analyses of works to speak for themselves, to show by their simple existence how and why to read.  Perhaps this is mildly justifiable, since most folks who pick up a Bloom book are likely bibliophiles themselves.  Nevertheless, and even to a bibliophile like myself, the book proved interesting but not entirely enriching.	2003-10-29

Indeed, it is a distinction that is lost on many, to whom liberty means democracy and vice versa.  This is not always the case, and one can exist in the absence of the other.  Zakaria's focus is where democracy, in whatever form, exists but where it is limited, where there liberty is checked--hence, illiberal.<BR> <BR>After an introduction, the book opens with a chapter tracing the history of liberty, which Zakaria argues arose from tensions between church and state (tensions which began in 324 when Constantine moved his capital from Rome to Byzantium).  Much of the development of liberty is rooted in conflict and competition, whether between church and state, or between the number of states that had sprung up in Europe, or, later, between lords and monarchs (from which the Magna Carta was generated).  The book also discusses the problems of the 20th century, particularly Nazism, which was basically a &quot;democratic&quot; phenomenon.  From this history, Zakaria attempts to glean lessons or prerequisites for democracy.  His big two are &quot;genuine&quot; economic development and the existence of effective political institutions.<BR> <BR>Zakaria then turns to modern times and applies the lessons of the past.  His argument is rife in economic determinism--too much so.  He frequently and sometimes approvingly quotes Marx to illustrate his points.  Perhaps this is somewhat unavoidable since Marx has penetrated our modes of thought so thoroughly, if subtly, but even so, Zakaria takes the deterministic argument quite far, even going so far as to suggest a threshold per capita income ($6,000) for stable democracy to take root.  Certainly, a productive economy is important, but I think Zakaria overstates its impact.<BR> <BR>I do, however, like his discussion of natural resources and how a vast supply can inhibit the development of genuinely democratic institutions.  Plentiful natural resources--or &quot;unearned riches&quot; (oil, for example)--provide governments with huge inflows of revenue, so much so that the government need not even (or virtually so) tax its people.  But taxes, Zakaria argues, are what generate government responsiveness to the people.  We Americans know the lesson well:  &quot;No taxation without representation.&quot;  But a government that doesn't tax its people doesn't rely on them for revenue, doesn't provide them much, and doesn't need to listen them much either; institutional development is hindered.  This isn't to suggest that we need more taxes.  But Zakaria makes a fascinating point here.<BR> <BR>Overall, Zakaria solidly and logically argues his ideas, even if he does sometimes overstate his points.  If nothing else (and it is probably much more), the book should provide food for thought and debate--and maybe even policy.  And especially as we try to install democracy in Iraq, the book couldn't have come at a better time.	2003-10-21

During the Iraq War, many talking heads told us that Donald Rumsfeld, the civilian Defense chief, had erred in &quot;watering down&quot; the invasion force, contrary to the advice of the generals. The result, we were told, would be disaster; the mid-war pause was cited as evidence of Rumsfeld's mistakes. From the beginning, criticism has plagued Rumsfeld, who was painted as an icy and arrogant Secretary whom the Pentagon brass despised. The war on terrorism has only slightly diminished that portrait. <br />Eliot Cohen analyzes Rumsfeld's leadership in the new afterword to the paperback edition of Supreme Command, which is an excellent (despite at least three glaring errors, probably typos, with dates) addition to an excellent book. Of course, the final verdict on Iraqi Freedom remains to be written--and will not be until the passage of time lends greater objectivity and documents are released. Nevertheless, despite lingering difficulties in securing the peace, the war was stunningly successful, the result of a war plan devised largely by Gen. Tommy Franks but also overseen by Rumsfeld, who guided the process and asked difficult questions (which might seem brazen to some). According to Cohen, while the crisis is not as great as those of the past, Rumsfeld's leadership bears comparison to that of Lincoln, Clemenceau, Churchill, and Ben-Gurion, the four subjects of his book. <br />Using those four wartime leaders as case studies, Cohen explores the nature of civil-military relationships, including what has been called the &quot;normal&quot; variety (in which the civil and military exist in mostly separate spheres), and explains how the great statesmen violated the &quot;normal&quot; theory. Indeed, it was such violations that contributed to their successes. They understood, in Clemenceau's now cliched statement, &quot;War is too important to be left to the generals,&quot; and actively participated in the conduct of military operations and the formation of strategy. They weren't always right and didn't try to do the jobs of their generals. But they asked difficult, pointed questions, creating a give-and-take between civilian and military leaders, and they demanded results. <br />Lincoln read telegraphs voraciously and effectively used letters to his generals; he was not afraid to relieve generals of command if they did not pursue his goal of destroying the Southern armies. Clemenceau visited the front every week and sought balance between the conflicting opinions of Petain and Foch. Churchill asked numerous and detailed questions and demanded written, point-by-point explanations of how his orders were carried out. Ben-Gurion mastered the most minute details of war and sought to create an army that was above the politics of the elements that came together to form it. Yet, despite the determination of all of them and a willingness to resort to seemingly extreme measures, the four are linked by a sort of moderation--a moderation, as Cohen explains it, that is not so much a third way pursued on its own as it is the result of leaning in a direction entirely opposite what was currently on the table. <br />Supreme Command is fascinating reading and fine analytic history. It will surely frame, or at least contribute to, any debate on the proper nature of civil-military relations and, indeed, on current events for some years to come.	2003-10-02

For readers seeking an introduction to the Peloponnesian War, I can imagine no better place to start--except, perhaps, Thucydides, but even then it might be wise to begin with this introduction.  Reading only this, the neophyte to ancient Greece would have a solid foundation and, desiring more, could easily turn to Kagan's original four-volume history of the war (although, to profit from that, it is a must to have read Thucydides).  Even those familiar with the war and with Kagan's works will find this a wonderful refresher.<BR> <BR>Kagan avoids modern parallels (except for the briefest of references to Neville Chamberlain and World War I) and the historiographical depth of his four-volume history and instead focuses on creating a solid, flowing narrative and analyzing events where necessary.  Kagan's framework for analysis centers on Pericles and his moderating influence on Athenian policy.  While Pericles was alive, Athens consistently took the middle path, avoiding the extremes of pacifism and aggression.  After he died in 429, Athens moved toward more aggressive policies, exemplified by the massacre at Melos.  <BR> <BR>Readers will no doubt form their own opinions and draw their own parallels to modern events--whether to the Cold War or the Great War--and that's Kagan's intention, to let the narrative speak for itself.  This &quot;tragic event&quot; is eminently worth studying, and Kagan is one of its most eminent modern students.  The book does not disappoint.	2003-09-27

Foote's narrative flows, sometimes soars, and other times is just downright eloquent.  The generals and leaders come to life and jump off the page--all in their own words and deeds, of course, with no embellishment, but with such vigor and color that other works simply do not or cannot convey.  Foote takes us into the world of battle, of strategy and tactics:  we hear the bullets, encounter the fog of war, watch the generals maneuver and engage.  His account of the Virginia-Maryland theater in 1862 is superb as he moves from McClellan's landing on the Peninsula and fighting the Seven Days to Second Bull Run and finally Antietam; the strategies of both sides come across in full force, with a degree of suspense.  The Eastern Theater really does seem a chessboard in Foote's narrative.  Frequently--maybe too often for some readers--the story is told through the eyes of Confederate commanders, and Foote is certainly sympathetic to the South.  Yet I'm prepared to believe him when he says, in his bibliographical note, that any tilt toward the South is attributable to his own heritage and his support for the underdog in a fight.  Besides, his concluding section on Lincoln is almost glowing.  Foote's The Civil War is a true achievement.	2003-09-22

He uses the historiographical methods of Carl Becker as a starting point, particularly the notion of an \\"ephemeral event\\" versus an \\"affirmed event.\\"  The ephemeral event is the actual historical occurrence--here, the battle--as it unfolds; the affirmed event is the event as it is described, explained, and constructed by participants and historians in the years following.  The ephemeral event evanesces, is never completely knowable, while the affirmed event assumes layer upon layer of interpretation, exaggeration, and distortion.  Harman seeks to strip away the chaff and get to what he believes is the true story of the ephemeral battle of Gettysburg.<BR> <BR>Harman's thesis is straightforward:  Lee's real plan at Gettysburg was to gain control of Cemetery Hill.  His argument is cogently and logically presented; one point flows into, and provides a foundation for, the next.  Beginning with the opening of the battle, Harman explains the importance of Cemetery Hill and why Lee focused on it.  From there, he spends a great deal of time--indeed, the bulk of the book--on the battle's second day, July 2, and places the rebel assault, particularly Longstreet's, within the Cemetery Hill scheme, rather than in the affirmed version that depicts the day's action as an assault on both Union flanks.  Lee's day-two objective was the Peach Orchard, from which artillery could fire on Cemetery Hill, and thus Sickles's moving his III Corps is seen as somewhat less foolish.  Moreover, as Harman posits, Lee did not aim for Little Round Top; rather, the fight for it occurred quite by accident when the intended Confederate attack up the Emmitsburg Road diverted to the right and toward the Round Tops after Hood was wounded.  Finally, day three and Pickett's Charge receive treatment.  The objective of the attack was Cemetery Hill, which commanders such as Longstreet and Hancock understood, and Harman explains at length how the \\"copse of trees\\" came to be seen as Lee's focus.<BR> <BR>Harman supports his points with the words of the participants, with his intimate familiarity with the lay of the land (from his experience as a Park Ranger), and with his rigorous analysis and close-reading of sources.  So much of this book's fun is seeing Harman build up his argument piece by piece and assemble Lee's tactical strategy into a coherent whole.  It is a joy to read.  Except for a minor quibble here or there, I find Harman's thesis convincing.  More than that, his insightful and refreshing ephemeral-versus-affirmed approach has fundamentally changed the way I look at history; I will now view the past through that lens.  As others have said, this is not a book for the neophyte, but anyone interested in Gettysburg, willing to think, and willing to re-consider traditional understandings should enjoy this book.	2003-09-19

The fight against Communism was waged both domestically and internationally, for better or worse, and would be for another forty years, even if it was done less at home and more abroad.  In the years since, the Fifties have been mythologized and vilified in almost every regard, from the supposed social stagnation and \\"oppression\\" of the family to the villainy of that \\"drunkard\\" McCarthy.  Without question, McCarthy made errors in his anti-Communism, and there was in him some frightening qualities of a demagogue.  But behind fifty years of academic cant and myth lies a kernel of truth:  the unquestionably flawed (like any man) McCarthy was fighting the good fight and, in some cases, was right; Tailgunner Joe was neither devil nor angel.  Much of the historical record, when unobscured by ideologically motivated researchers, bears this out.<BR> <BR>Ideology, however, cuts both ways, and its obstructions are just as dangerous from the right as they are from the left.  The academy and elite opinion have for years painted an ugly picture of the anti-Communist movement, which purportedly sacrificed free speech and civil liberties to eradicating Communism and which was prone to ranting and raving and flights of the imagination.  Such a perspective prevents us from gaining a full understanding of McCarthy--or even from understanding him at all--all while glossing over the dangers within, and the reasons to oppose, Communism.  But to approach things from the other side and paint anti-Communists as saints and opponents as traitors does not ameliorate the record.  This, too, precludes a complete understanding of McCarthy or the era.  It also reduces the thoughts and actions of many people of the left to mere treason, and their depth, complexity, and motivations are lost.  Neither picture is interesting; neither interpretation is history.  And the end result of the two sides is not a full interpretation:  two wrongs do not make a right.<BR> <BR>Ann Coulter fits right in with the people she is so quick to condemn and contributes to the degradation of politics, history, and even language.  She has turned history into the plaything of politics rather than restoring it to the source of wisdom that it should be.  She has debased language--if critics of the Bush administration are \\"traitors,\\" then what do we call people who really are attempting to bring down the government?  She has contributed to the polarization of politics and its reduction to name-calling and finger-pointing.  (She is, as some have said, the Michael Moore of the right.)  And she has given an ugly face to conservatism--so much so that the average person no longer associates it with the wit, logic, and urbanity of a William F. Buckley.  For a domestic history of the Cold War or for insights into the conservative mind, look elsewhere.	2003-09-18

In contemplating our Christian faith, Neuhaus urges us not to skip Good Friday and go right to Easter and the joy of the Resurrection (though it IS joyful).  Rather, we must reflect on the Crucifixion, on His death, without which there could have been no Resurrection and without which there would be no redemption.  Some outsiders and even many Christians find the Crucifixion morbid and shy away from pondering it, but it is meant to shock and disturb.  (This was not lost on Dostoevsky, who has some excellent passages and descriptions of the crucified Christ in The Idiot.)  It was a death and murder, one in which we all are complicit.  We must understand this before we can hope to understand the meaning of His death.<BR> <BR>Neuhaus uses the seven last &quot;words&quot; (utterances, really) of Christ to explore the nature of His life and death, as well as the nature of our own lives and deaths.  Tangentially, he comments on our culture and society, on permissivity and the like--ideas that will be familiar to readers of First Things.  But this is primarily a book on religion, not politics.  Nor is it an exposition of theology.  Neuhaus avoids the often complicated and difficult-to-understand theological matters (and debates) that surround Christ's life, death, and resurrection, as well as the implications for us.  Certainly, Neuhaus adheres to his--which is to say, the Catholic Church's--interpretation, but here he seeks to get to the foundations of Christianity.  The result is something all Christians--and, indeed, anyone desiring to understand the faith--can enjoy and appreciate.	2003-09-12

On this score, I must say that Woodward's multipart series for The Post back in January 2002, &quot;Ten Days in September,&quot; is a much more enjoyable and worthwhile read; it does in a few pages what this book takes hundreds to do--not to mention the fact that, written just after 9-11, it has a greater sense of immediacy.  The book doesn't have the emotion, the urgency, the poignancy of that series; all that was lost in the passage of months or spread thinly throughout this book.  I should not, probably, be too harsh on journalists as book writers, despite my unfavorable impressions of Woodward's book and Frank Bruni's.  After all, David Maraniss wrote a superb and highly readable biography of Vince Lombardi.  But back to Bush at War...<BR> <BR>What comes through here is the same old story we heard for months:  Rumsfeld is the hawk, Powell is the dove with claws (to use Johnny Cash's Vietnam-era phrase), Rice brokers between the two, and Bush makes the final decisions.  Woodward's account is one-sided.  Evidently and not too surprisingly, Powell was more open about granting interviews (perhaps it was one of his tactics in the power game), and Rumsfeld was not.  This is a glaring flaw throughout the entire book, especially when Woodward starts paraphrasing what Rumsfeld might have said or is reported to have said (signalled by abandoning the quotation marks).  For whatever it's worth, given these imbalance, Powell comes across as the hero, the torn moderate who eventually prevails in the end (that is, in getting Bush to give the UN a chance in fall 2002).  Rumsfeld is painted variously as demanding boss, evil taskmaster, and uncooperative interviewer, despite Woodward's concluding efforts to give some credit to the Defense Secretary.<BR> <BR>Some reviewers have written that this book is evidence of Bush'sinability to be self-critical or to think for himself.  Quite the opposite seems to be true, if this book is any guide.  That Bush surrounds himself with talented people and lets them debate the tough questions is not a sign of weakness.  Constantly, Bush asks the difficult questions, sets the deadlines, demands results.  Yes, he sits back sometimes and allows his principals to wade through thorny issues, but the final decision is his--firmly.  And he does have a vision, one that Woodward had difficulty seeing until the end.  At the root of that vision, informed by Bush's faith, is to advance the cause of human rights and freedom, to eliminate, so far as possible, needless human suffering.  With Bush still in office, the final verdict on his leadership is some years away.  But I could not help thinking that he would make for interesting study in Eliot Cohen's Supreme Command framework.  Time will tell.<BR> <BR>If you read Woodward's 2002 Post series, or even if you just watch TV or read the morning news, this book will probably offer nothing new.  Perspectives on the several issues above could easily be obtained from other sources over the past two years.  Like most other journalists, Woodward's writing does not easily translate into book-length studies.  This is not to deprecate him; it's simply to acknowledge the fact that he's a journalist (a highly respected and talented one at that).  Perhaps in ten years, when more documents are available, someone will write the history of 9-11 and the war on terror in the way it deserves to be written and analyzed.  I wait for that day.	2003-08-28
US	44497166	R33CJ2LYBI06O8	0446527173	4003610	Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds	Books	3	26	30	N	N	not Bloom's best	Harold Bloom loves--LOVES--reading, books, the written word.  That comes through in all of his recent books and adds an extra something to them.  And this work has that something, which is enough to recommend reading it, despite its flaws and pretensions.  <br />Bloom assembles his 100 geniuses according to Kabbalah, the old Jewish form of speculation, which is difficult to penetrate.  Still, while I was initially put off by this method, it did occasionally bear fruit in the juxtaposition of not often compared geniuses:  John Donne and Lady Murasaki, for example.  Bloom's obsessions come through, as well, for better or worse (depending on one's own):  the Gnosticism surely familiar to Bloom fans; his Bardolatry; his loathing for T.S. Eliot (although he does include him, justifiably, as a genius).  This is a very personal book, in which Bloom offers his own reflections on these writers and on the world.  We find out, for example, that Bloom does not accept the legitimacy of George W. Bush and (twice) that he laments the fact that an atheist can't be \\"elected dogcatcher\\" in the US (both times with the same phrase).  He puts forth interesting thoughts on each writer, but his readings (misreadings?) of Flannery O'Connor and Dostoevsky are particularly grating:  he understates the Christian faith of both, and even goes so far as to suggest that Dostoevsky was at his worst when writing about spiritual matters.<br />All that aside, the book still has its merits.  These geniuses are lovingly and passionately collected, and their words are frequently excerpted.  Many--probably most--of these quotations are absolutely fascinating, riveting; more than a few of which are worth copying down for future reference.  A published review somewhere, I now forget where, suggested that this is not a book to read straight through, and it is not, indeed.  Rather, it yields the most pleasure when jumping from person to person, from one's favorite writers to those one doesn't know so well--and back again.  Despite its flaws and Bloom's obsessions, it is still a book to be savored.	2003-08-28
US	44497166	R1KVFZQR6V4DBP	0195135210	436402699	Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam (Pivotal Moments in American History)	Books	5	1	2	N	N	classic McPherson	For a complete narrative of the battle itself, readers will want to consult another work--perhaps Sears' Landscape Turned Red.  But for a brief treatment of Antietam that places it in its larger context and argues for its significance as the war's turning point, this is the work.  And at that, McPherson succeeds, bringing his characteristically broad brush and keen storytelling skills to bear.  Antietam, says McPherson, played a pivotal role for the morale of the armies (the Union had just come off a particularly bad run of defeats, for example), for the elections of 1862 (in which Republicans lost some ground, as well as gained some, but could have done far worse had Antietam not turned out as it did), for the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation, and for diplomacy, particularly international recognition of Southern independence.  On this last point, McPherson's argument is especially convincing.  Even in the two weeks following the battle and preceding the arrival of the news in London, the British government was probably as close as it would ever come to recognizing the Confederacy--a possibility Antietam permanently removed.  Had any number of things gone differently (for instance, the Special Orders No. 191 affair), Antietam could well have been the South's Saratoga (which eighty-five years earlier had secured the French alliance for the revolutionaries of Seventy-Six).  Instead, the Army of Northern Virginia was turned back, even if McClellan did not pursue it for the rout.  And that made all the difference.	2003-08-28

It is all the more worthy of close attention as we try to re-make Iraq.  Policymakers would do well to study our efforts in Germany.  John Dower's Embracing Defeat on post-war Japan, I understand, was required reading in the White House last spring, and for the information it presents, Beschloss's book also merits high-level attention.<br />But for sheer pleasure of reading, the book doesn't quite make the grade.  Beschloss, apparently, began and nearly completed the book some ten years ago and then set it aside to await the release of confidential documents, finally completing it in 2002.  Whether it is a function of the ten-year gap or of Beschloss's style (this is the first of his works I have read), I'm not certain, but the book is extremely choppy.  He breaks the story into episodes, some as long as pages, others only a paragraph.  The narrative thus has no flow to it, and while the technique may illuminate certain characteristics of the leading figures (such as Roosevelt or Morgenthau or Truman), it detracts from the book's overall effect.<br />Given the parallels to current events, The Conquerors is worth reading--but only if you can endure a jarring, halting read.	2003-07-26

And each time it offers new meanings and insights.  Part of its charm derives from the fact that it can be appreciated on so many different levels, however hackneyed it may be to suggest so.  It can be read through and enjoyed as an adventure story, full of drama and suspense.  But, of course, it is much, much more, and this is why it is such a wonderful piece of literature.<br />Lord of the Flies is best known, probably, for its symbolism, and as one critic has opined, it is a symbolism that works.  Each element, each symbol, operates individually, independently, but also interlocks with everything else in the book--not simply the other symbols but also the characters, the setting, the theme--from which it draws its deepest meaning.  The conch, the platform, Piggys specs, the pigs head, the island itself--they all fit beautifully and memorably together, along with Goldings stunning descriptions of places, characters, and events, to create the picture of a society corrupted by flaws in its constitutive human beings.  It richly deserves its reputation as a classic.	2003-07-21

It is difficult to know any historical figure, especially as his contemporaries knew him, and Franklin's being a multifaceted, sometimes enigmatic person makes knowing him particularly challenging--and also extremely interesting.  But Edmund S. Morgan, relying on the thirty-six currently published volumes (with more on the way) of Franklin's writings, does an admirable job of introducing us to this famous Founder.<br />It is not Morgan's intention to offer an exhaustive treatment of Franklin's life.  Rather, he paints a portrait of the man's character, personality, and opinions and shows how these traits came through in what Franklin did.  The picture of Franklin that emerges here is one of a curious, industrious, energetic man, one who enjoys the company of others (particularly women--and younger women at that), one who is devoted to public service, one who dislikes controversy and scandal.  He uses his considerable talents to benefit his fellow man (and himself) and to improve the world around him, as he did for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and eventually for the nascent United States.  Morgan traces three major ideas running through many of Franklin's actions--(1) his belief in voluntary associations for mutual assistance, such as the fire company and library in Philadelphia; (2) the goal, ultimately abandoned, of uniting the American colonies with England in an Anglo-American empire, a single political community destined for greatness; and (3) his belief that what is right is that which is beneficial.  It is also interesting, and more than a little surprising, to note, as well, that from 1757 to his death in 1790, Franklin spent only eight years in his native land.<br />Readers of this volume will inevitably want to turn to more in-depth biographies of Franklin, or perhaps even to his own writings.  But for a brief and insightful picture of the man, either as introduction or re-acquaintance, I can imagine no better work than this one.	2003-07-21
US	44497166	RZ6PL291P0X2C	0671867423	534494015	Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America	Books	3	19	24	N	N	solid cultural history, weak political argument	This is a well-written book, with moments of eloquence.  In the end, though, it is uneven and unsatisfying--and mistitled.  The centerpiece is, indeed, the Gettysburg Address, but Wills spends most of his time exploring the cultural background to the speech (e.g. the Greek revival, nineteenth-century cemeteries, Transcendentalism) and discussing Lincoln's other speeches.  All this is fine, and often interesting, but the book might more appropriately have been titled, \\"Lincoln:  The Man Whose Words Remade America.\\"<br />When he treats the cultural aspects of the period and the speech, Wills it at his best.  His discussion of Greek rhetoric is truly fascinating.  During the early 1800s, the United States experienced a Greek revival, in which intellectual thought moved from the Roman-republic fixation of the Founders to the ancient Greek democratic tradition.  Edward Everett, a gigantic figure of the time and the main speaker at Gettysburg, led this transformation, part of which injected elements of Greek rhetoric into the culture.  This showed up most prominently in the form of Greek funeral orations (such as the famous one of Pericles), a style that Lincoln adopted in his address.  Also interesting is Wills' chapter on the culture of death:  how cemeteries became detached from churches and moved into rural areas, how they were viewed as places of reflection and education, how even children were encouraged to participate in this culture.<br />However, when Wills moves beyond this generally straightforward telling of history into argument, the book grows considerably weaker.  Arguing against James McPherson is a dangerous thing to do, and Wills does it twice, declaring that McPherson is wrong to suggest that Lincoln came to view the South, in some manner, as a foreign power and that his position evolved to embrace unconditional surrender and total war.  Not that McPherson is infallible (indeed, I'm not entirely convinced on the former point), but Wills' arguments are entirely unconvincing.  Moreover, Wills apparently has some ideological axes to grind against the conservative movement he left some years ago.  Twice does Wills mention the twentieth century.  Both times he attacks \\"states' rights\\" or \\"original intent\\" conservatives.  Criticism is heaped upon Robert Bork, Ronald Reagan, and Edwin Meese, and special animus is reserved for Willmoore Kendall.  None of these individuals is beyond criticism, but doing so in this book seems out of place and disrupts the narrative flow.<br />Wills' thesis that Lincoln effected a revolution in American political thought is a sound though not at all original one.  To my mind, this book's merit lies in the first half of the book, where Wills delves into the culture of the early 1800s and places the Gettysburg Address within that milieu.  The rest of the book, however, proves valuable only as a starting point for controversy, which is not entirely bad.	2003-07-11
US	44497166	RZD6XWVD1K481	0345359429	345581260	Battle Cry of Freedom:  The Civil War Era	Books	5	7	9	N	N	outstanding	This book is truly and undoubtedly a classic of Civil War history, and although it consists of only one volume (860 pages of text can hardly be called \\"slim,\\" however), Battle Cry of Freedom surely ranks up there with the legendary works of Foote, Catton, and Freeman.  As a book for the beginning Civil War buff or for anyone desiring a broad look at the entire era, I can imagine no better starting point.<br />And McPherson's brush is, indeed, very broad.  He covers the political and legal, the economic and social, the military and diplomatic aspects of the period (roughly 1846-1865)--swiftly because of the nature of the book but still insightfully and thoughtfully.  The war is similarly treated in all its dimensions:  technological developments; hospitals and nurses; prisons; tactics and strategy; generals and privates; logistics; terrain and weather.  In one area, though, the book is lacking.  With all the attention McPherson gives to the twenty years preceding the war, I was mildly disappointed by his cutting off with Lincoln's assassination.  Even if he did not want to cover Reconstruction in too much detail (perhaps leaving it for the next volume in the series), there is still a ton of fascinating details he could have inserted, such as Stanton's assuming de facto leadership of the country before Johnson's swearing-in.  But this diminishes the book, so wonderful in every other regard, only slightly.<br />To all this, McPherson brings a talent for telling a story and adds the occasional witticism.  (I loved some of the Lee-as-fox comparisons:  \\"Like a rabbit mesmerized by the gray fox, Hooker was frozen into immobility...\\"  McPherson did seem a bit too fond of discretion-is-the-better-part-of-valor explanations--at least three of them by my count.)  His transitions between chapters, paragraphs, and topics are simply excellent, even between seemingly disparate subjects; one topic flows effortlessly and seamlessly into the next.  The narrative of Gettysburg is extremely well done.<br />McPherson has his preferences and opinions.  Lincoln favors well.  He is not, though, beyond McPherson's criticism.  The president's questionable or illegal infringements on civil rights receive ample treatment, but so, too, do similar actions in the South (suspension of habeas corpus, imposition of martial law).  Grant also is treated positively, as are Sherman and Sheridan--all of whom figure into McPherson's argument that the Western theater was pivotal, both in the military gains there and in the fine generals it helped produce.  McClellan comes off quite poorly, not entirely without reason, as something of a megalomaniac with a messiah complex.  The historian must inevitably weigh in on these issues and others, and just as inevitably clash with others who believe otherwise.  But for the most part, this book is about the story of this nation-saving and nation-defining conflict, interestingly and insightfully told.  McPherson's book is clearly one for the ages.	2003-06-29

While my knowledge of the field and the battle itself likely do not rival McPherson's, I know exactly what he means when he says the place is like a second home.  I love Gettysburg.  So, too, does McPherson, and his passion permeates this slim little book.  Easily read in a couple of hours, Hallowed Ground is part travel journal, part guidebook, part history, deftly woven together by this gifted historian and storyteller.<br />For those familiar with Gettysburg the battle and the place, reading Hallowed Ground is like visiting with an old friend.  For those who have never been, it is an invitation.  All the sites are there:  the Round Tops, Seminary and Cemetery Ridges, Culp's and Cemetery Hills, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, the Peach Orchard, the McPherson Farm (no relation to the author).  But McPherson goes deeper, to the monuments and their stories, even to the observation towers that old hands will recognize.  The emotions are here, too.  The strange elation you feel driving beneath the trees on Seminary Ridge or climbing the boulders at Devil's Den (at least in your younger days), knowing that men, great and small, walked these same paths, stood on the same ground, fought here for cause and comrade.  And yet, knowing that many of these men died here--maybe in the Wheatfield--you feel the solemnity of the place, the horror of tens of thousands of casualties.  You sense your own smallness and are awed by the actions that took place here; you are both proud and grateful.<br />None other than Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who acted heroically at Gettysburg, captured these sentiments and emotions.  \\"In great deeds, something abides.  On great fields something stays.  Forms change and pass; bodies disappear, but spirits linger, to consecrate the ground for the vision-place of souls.  And reverent men and women from afar, and generations that know us not and that we know not of, heart-drawn to see where and by whom great things were suffered and done for them...\\"  The spirit of Chamberlain's words pervades McPherson's book, a work that should appeal to buffs as well as neophytes.<br />Before reading, though, beware.  If you can put this book down without wanting to visit Gettysburg (again or for the first time), you have greater will power than I.	2003-06-29
US	44497166	R1G69XFKC9ZYNF	0345461924	846543535	Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East	Books	4	5	7	N	N	even-handed and readable account of controversial event	After 9-11 and during Enduring Freedom, the reading public fixated on a slew of books on terrorism, Islam, and the Middle East, producing some bestsellers that otherwise would not have received that status or, worse, did not deserve it in the first place.  But Oren's excellent book richly deserved its bestseller status and, one hopes, would have been widely read had there not been high interest in 2002 (the war's thirty-fifth anniversary).<br />Oren opens with the background to the conflict, particularly the 1948 and 1956 wars, whose conclusions left tensions at heightened levels, not to mention issues that were unresolved.  Admittedly, this general treatment isn't overly exciting, but it is absolutely necessary to know the context, since so much of Middle East conflict is rooted in history (or perceptions of it), as much today as in 1967.  It is also important to know the mindsets prevailing at the time:  Israel's dual and paradoxical sense of invincibility and vulnerability and Egypt's desire to effect Arab greatness and unity.  Moreover, Oren also explores the Cold War aspects of the conflict.  The Arab world is frequently discussed as a Cold War battlefield, in which the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power and in which nations, especially Egypt, tried to play both sides to its own advantage.  The Suez Crisis of 1956 is usually adduced as an example of the Cold War in the Middle East, but too seldom is attention given to the Six Day War as part of the greater superpower conflict.  Not a proxy war in the sense that Vietnam or Afghanistan were, the 1967 war nevertheless witnessed intense diplomatic activity and tension between the US and USSR, including the danger of war over Israel's accidental bombing of the USS Liberty.  The Cold War provides part of the background for the war, as well as for the course it took, and Oren's perspectives are appreciated.<br />The meat of the book is devoted to a day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour, account of thewar, from the events precipitating it through its conclusion in the Golan Heights in Syria.  If the book's opening contextual section was slow (though interesting), the actual account of the war itself was, as one review had it, \\"seamless.\\"  Oren's narrative is exciting, gripping, riveting--indeed, hard to put down.  We read of the war's opening on June 5, with the launching of the aerial attack on Egypt's air force (Israeli intelligence had pinpointed the exact location of many Egyptian aircraft and even knew the names of the pilots) and the accompanying uncertainty among Israel's leaders.  We find Ariel Sharon leading the assault on Umm Qatef in Sinai.  Oren takes us to the streets of Jerusalem, to the northern settlements under Syrian bombardment, to the halls of power in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria.  <br />Oren's close focus on these halls--on individuals and their interactions--is a major strength of his work.  Enigmatic Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan grabs for power in the Cabinet over indecisive (or moderating) Prime Minister Eshkol; Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin bears the weight of the planning, collapses, and emerges a hero.  Gamal Nasser imagines himself the leader of the Arab world and seeks the honor of crushing the \\"Zionist entity,\\" all while his Field Marshal `Amer creates incoherent and untenable military strategy and policy and feeds fabricated reports of Egyptian victories to Nasser and the public (to damaging effect, a mistake Syria would repeat).  Jordan's King Hussein charts a potentially dangerous middle path, cooperating with Egypt in order to appease his people but trying to avoid a split with his supplier, the US.  Oren's analysis of these men and their relationships are truly fascinating.<br />My one complaint about the book is the lack of attention it gives domestic politics.  Oren does touch on the matter, particularly as it related to King Hussein and, to a lesser extent, Nasser.  But Israel's domestic situation--except for a few mentions of its economy and of the lobbying for action by residents of settlements under Syrian bombardment--receives little substantive treatment.  It would have been insightful, for example, to read what the Israeli people were saying about their leadership at the time and what, if any, constraints they were placing on their leaders.  But this is a minor quibble with a book that is, ostensibly, military history.  Oren's goal was to rise above his own prejudices and above the ideological warfare of other historians and produce a balanced account of the Six Day War.  He has succeeded in crafting an even-handed and eminently readable chronicle of this important event.	2003-06-20
US	44497166	RTFO0QPDE3NN7	0374179395	35301100	First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power	Books	5	10	11	N	N	a triumph of a book	Zimmermann has written an excellent book about the roots and beginnings of the \\"American Century.\\"  Influenced by Walter Isaacson's The Wise Men (a \\"group biography\\" of the Cold War), he devotes the first (and strongest) part to five leading figures, who formed a sort of network:  John Hay, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Elihu Root, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt.  <br />Hay, who began his career as Lincoln's secretary, was a diplomat, a businessman, and a sometime writer and poet who eventually rose to become ambassador to Great Britain and Secretary of State to McKinley and Roosevelt.  His Open Door notes paved the way for an Asian strategy that would play out, at least indirectly, with Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the century that followed, and he helped establish the special relationship with Great Britain that did much to shape world politics (many overlook the fact that throughout the 1800s, US-GB relations were icy, and many Americans viewed the British either as an enemy or rival).<br />Alfred Thayer Mahan was and is well known as the author of The Influence of Sea Power upon History.  He drew heavily from the lessons of the Napoleonic wars-Bonaparte lost because of his losses at sea, and Mahan also applied Napoleonic land warfare to the sea (he even named his dog \\"Jomini,\\" after the French military strategist).  Interestingly, he began as an anti-imperialist, but as he studied naval history and strategy, he realized, for example, that coaling stations and bases were necessary, thus necessitating an imperial policy.  Mahan, Zimmermann argues, set the framework for the debate of the 1890s, as the US built up its navy and developed its foreign policies.  Traces of Mahan can be found in the modern concepts of deterrence, détente, sufficiency, and globalism.<br />Elihu Root was a New York lawyer and son and brother of mathematicians/engineers (who, within the family, were called \\"Cube Root\\" and \\"Square Root\\").  Root was a man of apparent contradictions.  He was a Republican reformer, and yet he served on the defense team for Boss Tweed.  He served under McKinley and Roosevelt as Secretary of War, and then Secretary of State under Roosevelt.  Root was involved in the famous Platt Amendment regarding Cuba and also in several agreements with Japan, including the Root-Takahira Agreement.  He is also supposed to have played a key role in the formation of the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.<br />Henry Cabot Lodge was born into the Boston aristocracy and at first pursued a career as a historian.  In the 1884 election, he and Roosevelt, both reformers, opposed the nomination of Blaine as the Republican candidate, but in the end, they refused to split with the party (and join the Mugwumps) and endorsed Blaine, who eventually lost to Cleveland.  Following that, Lodge and TR became close, with Lodge serving as Roosevelt's advocate with national leaders and helping to secure him jobs on the Civil Service Commission and in the Navy Department.  Lodge also supported policies of imperialism and would gain notoriety in his opposition to Wilson in 1919-1920 over the Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations, for which he is sometimes mistaken as an isolationist.<br />Theodore Roosevelt, of course, needs no introduction.  An asthmatic child, born into wealth, he pursued \\"the strenuous life\\" of intense activity.  Zimmermann describes him particularly aptly:  TR \\"crackled with kinetic energy.\\"  Roosevelt's glorification and pursuit of war are well known, as are his activist foreign policy and support for imperialism (which he usually called \\"Americanism\\").  Zimmermann offers a particularly intriguing argument about why TR wanted to go to war and participate in it himself.  During the Civil War, perhaps because his in-laws fought for the South, TR's New Yorker father hired a substitute to serve for him, and Zimmermann suggests TR did not want to have to explain to his children why he himself did not serve (as his father had todo).  It is an interesting argument and quite convincing.<br />In the second part of the book, Zimmermann traces the interactions of these individuals in shaping American policy and world events in, roughly, the 1890 to 1910 period.  The topics are familiar-the Spanish-American War, the Philippine Insurrection, the Panama Canal, the Great White Fleet.  Much of this is already well-covered ground, but through the lens of the five men, Zimmermann offers interesting new perspectives.  The impact of these years on the twentieth century, and even through today, is huge, and many of the same issues, debates, and problems continue to exist.  Though Zimmermann does not note the parallels (perhaps the book was published too soon), I could not help drawing comparisons between the State-War divide then and the State-Defense divide now.  (The Spanish-American War was primarily a War Department-driven conflict, not least because the State Department was led by a senile John Sherman.)  Nor could I help finding echoes, for better or worse, of today's Richard Perle and the Defense Policy Board in Alfred Thayer Mahan and his Naval War Board in 1898.  The legacies of these five men no doubt have lingered and will continue to endure as the US seeks to define its role in an ever-changing world.	2003-05-01
US	44497166	R1862KND0WM03Y	0670889040	108158930	Woodrow Wilson (Penguin Lives)	Books	2	3	3	N	N	lacks substance and depth	Cecil Spring-Rice, the British ambassador to Washington, described Woodrow Wilson as \\"a mysterious, a rather Olympian personage and shrouded in darkness from which issue occasional thunderbolts.\\"  At least to his contemporaries, the twenty-eighth president may well have been something of an enigma.  After all, he did somehow move from a fairly conservative philosophy toward a more activist government, including a reversal on child labor laws.  Unfortunately, Auchincloss contributes little to shedding some light on these riddles of Wilson's character and mind-except for the all-important (to Auchincloss, at least) reason for the estrangement between Wilson and his advisor/friend/confidante Colonel Edward M. House, which is attributed to Edith Wilson.<br />Auchincloss paints a very superficial picture of Wilson, and maybe that's because of the nature of the Penguin Lives series, but there was much that was mentioned in passing and not really mentioned again.  For example, Wilson's southern birth and upbringing are given early and justified attention, but the consequences of this southern heritage on Wilson's life and politics are not pursued, even though the question is particularly interesting, relevant, and important for the president's views on race.  Wilson's deep Presbyterian faith is given similarly superficial treatment.  It did much to create the man's stubbornness and sense of moral rectitude, but how it shaped the specific elements of Wilson's idealism, Auchincloss does not explore.  All that emerges is the all-too typical portrait of a man with a \\"divided\\" nature.<br />I did find his discussion of the 1916 election interesting, particularly the contingency plan in the case of a Wilson defeat.  In this period of international crisis, had Wilson lost to Charles Evans Hughes, Vice President Marshall and Secretary of State Lansing would have resigned, Hughes would have been named Secretary of State, and Wilson would also have resigned.  I had never heard this before and hope to explore the issue further.<br />Besides an apparent affinity for describing certain remarks as \\"intemperate,\\" Auchincloss seemed to be fixated on the grandson of Henry Cabot Lodge and on Bill Clinton, both of whom he mentions twice.  Lodge's grandson receives considerable scorn for trying to justify his grandfather's behavior (his \\"hatred\\" of Wilson and his reading of the Versailles Treaty in the Senate).  The Clinton impeachment is mentioned as an example of the people's representatives taking action against the will of a majority, and Clinton's definition of \\"is\\" is compared to Lodge's grandson's definition of \\"hatred.\\"  Maybe these are legitimate comparisons (though probably not), but they seemed wholly out of place in this biography.<br />These Penguin biographies aren't necessarily intended to be the deepest or most insightful of books, but they should at least contain some substance.  This one, unfortunately, contains very little that can't be had by reading an American history textbook.	2003-04-28
US	44497166	R22VJ44A55M17	0670030783	10638082	Napoleon (Penguin Lives)	Books	4	7	13	N	N	a quick, fun, and insightful biography	I must admit two things upfront:  (1) I am a great fan of Paul Johnson and read his books voraciously, and (2) although I am a student of history in general, I am somewhat unfamiliar (perhaps embarrassingly so) with the Napoleonic era.  So maybe I am more inclined than the next person to view this book favorably, but judging from the other reviews, I don't think I'm too far off in praising this biography.<br />Despite the general chronological flow, Johnson does not construct the book entirely in linear terms, and the repetitions and overlaps can be somewhat frustrating at first.  However, organizing Napoleon's life into illustrative episodes or around general themes does have its merits.  These themes are that Napoleon-or, rather, Bonaparte, the name he preferred-was not an ideologue but an opportunist; that he lived his life and governed as he led military campaigns-by crushing opposition, inspiring fear, moving quickly, by using propaganda (all of these might be embodied in Bonaparte's crushing the Paris mobs in October 1795, when he gave them \\"a whiff of grapeshot\\"); that in him can be found the font of the totalitarian state, which Johnson calls \\"the ultimate progeny of the Napoleonic reality and myth.\\"  Johnson assembles the narrative around these arguments.<br />Johnson also seems to be interested in contingency, in the what-ifs of history-what if France had not bought Corsica from Genoa the year before Bonaparte's birth; what if France would have paid him the promised amount during his \\"exile\\" on Elba; what if he had realized the possibilities of Louisiana and cultivated it, instead of waging war on the continent.  I have always found this a useful way of viewing history, and Johnson uses it to good effect.  He also points to some of the basic historiographic debates within Napoleon scholarship, such as the circumstances of his death on St. Helena.<br />These Penguin Lives books are not intended to be exhaustive analyses of their subjects, but simply generaloverviews and introductions for a wide audience-with the good ones offering new or interesting takes on these individuals and whetting the reader's appetite to delve deeper into their lives.  Johnson succeeds on both accounts, while crystallizing two centuries of writing on Napoleon into 190 pages.  His writing is fluid and lucid, the narrative deftly, sometimes wittily told.  His arguments are intriguing and maybe even controversial (to some).  But that's what makes history so fun-and part of what makes this book so fun, too.	2003-04-26
US	44497166	R202XFM6XFPCH0	0312133103	108825033	The Era of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933-1945: A Brief History with Documents (The Bedford Series in History and Culture)	Books	4	21	23	N	N	imbalanced but strong	According to its title, the book compiles documents from 1933-1945, the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the contents are strongly tilted toward the 1933-1941 period.  Maybe that's justified, given Polenberg's clear focus on domestic social and political issues and given, of course, that the New Deal period consituted more years than World War II.  But I felt more than a little disappointed by the brief treatment the war effort received.  And the documents pertaining to the war focused largely on Japanese internment and the issue of bombing the concentration camps.  These are both important topics and worthy of attention, particularly the latter which I fear is sometimes overlooked (and which is in many ways a telling issue).  FDR's Four Freedoms speech is not included, nor the Atlantic Charter, nor the Pearl Harbor speech.  The book would definitely have profited from inclusion of these documents and perhaps also of documents pertaining to strategy or military policy.<br />Nevertheless, the book has three strong points that make it worthwhile.  One, Polenberg includes a wide variety of primary sources:  speeches, photographs, Supreme Court decisions, letters, posters, poems, songs, press conferences, etc.  The sources also come from a range of people, left and right, &quot;large and small.&quot;  This makes the book particularly useful as a teaching tool for showing students how to tackle primary documents of all types.<br />Two, in the book's imbalance lies its strongest element--it covers the Depression and the New Deal thoroughly, offering new perspectives and carving new dimensions.  We hear from the Roosevelts, both Franklin and Eleanor.  We read the views of writers John Steinbeck and Upton Sinclair, and of Roosevelt opponents Charles Coughlin and Huey Long.  Administration officials provide their opinions on New Deal legislation (including the frequently ignored Federal Theatre Project).  Dorothea Lange's photographs depict the misery and poverty of the Depression.  Mexican-American, African-American, and Native American viewpoints also receive attention.  Polenberg successfully draws documents to paint a multi-dimensional, in-depth portrait of the 1930s.<br />And three, Polenberg concludes with a fine bibliography for further reading on the various topics of spanned by the documents.<br />All in all, despite the weak coverage of World War II, the book is eminently useful for readers interested in the period and especially for teachers and students.  Had Polenberg covered the war years in the same detail as the Depression/New Deal, this would be a thoroughly excellent sourcebook.  Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile book and could function quite well in an AP history course, or as a complement to reading, say, David Kennedy's Freedom from Fear.	2003-04-26

And the greatest defender of those things is education, which provides citizens the tools to recreate civilization if necessary.<br />Hart argues, quite convincingly, that the motive force of Western civilization is the tension between Athens and Jerusalem, between secularism and faith.  He devotes the first part of his book to the background of this idea and exploring it in early literary works.  He compares Homer's epics, particularly The Iliad, to the early books of the Bible, which could properly be called The Mosead; Homer depicts the pursuit of warrior heroism and arete (excellence), while Moses represents the triumph of monotheism.  In Socrates and Jesus (the latter of whom is given a literary reading), Hart locates shifts within the respective spheres.  Socrates takes the Homeric pursuit of excellence and turns it into the pursuit of philosophy and truth.  On the Jerusalem side, Jesus marks a movement from the outwardly oriented Mosaic Law toward a more internal sense of holiness.  This first section--the explication of the Great Narrative--concludes with Paul, who represents a sort of synthesis between Athens and Jerusalem, bringing together Greek philosphy and Judeo-Christian religion.<br />In the second section (&quot;Explorations&quot;), Hart traces these tensions throughout various works of literature, beginning with Augustine's Confessions, a work of interior exploration.  Hart also treats Dante and Shakespeare, as well as the Enlightenment authors Moliere and Voltaire, who attempted to bring about a Jerusalem-to-Athens shift.  Voltaire fairs exceedingly well in the analysis of this conservative writer.  Hart admires in the Frenchman his wit and his energy and, indeed, acknowledges that the Englightment, whatever its flaws and ill consequences, is &quot;indispensable.&quot;  He concludes with a juxtaposed analysis of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby.  He offers a not entirely original argument of Raskolnikov as Hamlet (&quot;Hamlet in St. Petersburg&quot;), but his reading of Gatsby (&quot;Faust in Great Neck&quot;) is both interesting and fascinating--Gatsby is a sort of magician and the work as a whole embodies magical transformation as the essence of modernity.<br />In the Afterword, Hart presents a delightful and delicious skewering of multiculturalism and finishes on a note of optimism:  that we are slowly returning to cognition rather than ideology in our institutions of learning.  For that reason, and for Hart's book, we can smile through the cultural catastrophe.writer.

Conservatism is not an easily definable philosophy, since so many different groups of people call themselves conservative (just look at Pat Buchanan versus, say, the good folks at National Review), but D'Souza does an admirable job offering a general definition, rooting it in the recognition of moral standards and of the \\"warped timber of humanity.\\"  Conservatism, he says, is a framework through which we can view the world.  There's much, much more to conservatism, but that is a solid foundation.<br />If you follow D'Souza at all, or any conservative speaker for that matter, you're probably quite familiar with what he has to say, and to that extent, you might find the book a bit repetetive.  But D'Souza argues cogently, clearly, and with common sense.  By far the most enjoyable part for me was D'Souza's stories from his Dartmouth years.  The tales of the Dartmouth Review were humorous and, some of them, inspiring.  But his recollections about Prof. Jeffrey Hart were quite hilarious, indeed.  Admittedly, I am something of a fan of Hart's, but the stories about him were priceless--how he wore raccoon coats and buttons saying \\"Soak the Poor,\\" how he had a contraption he claimed was for pinching certain individuals.<br />I do have one quibble with D'Souza--namely, his advice that a conservative on campus should be philosophically conservative but temperamentally radical.  Ignoring the fact that he later advises Republicans to be philosophically conservative but temperamentally genial (can one be radical and genial?), I can't bring myself to accept that a conservative--any time or any place--should be radical in temperament, even in the face of liberal onslaught.<br />And he concludes with an excellent reading list--just a starting point, but still quite good--for conservatives, even though it leaves off William F. Buckley, Robert Nisbet, and T.S. Eliot.  All things considered, this is a wonderful little book that should provide ample ammunition for any conservative, especially those engaged in debates with campus liberals.	2003-04-18
US	44497166	RL07AKKBS0FOO	0385501684	699519594	Hail, Holy Queen	Books	5	14	15	N	N	a beautiful book	When I first started to gravitate toward the Catholic Church (from a Protestant denomination), Mary was one of the biggest stumbling blocks on that journey.  While I'm not entirely there yet, it is only waiting to begin RCIA in the fall that holds me back (not that the journey ever ends in any case)--and not an objection to Marian devotion.  For that, I can thank Scott Hahan and his marvelous little book.  In addition to prayer and reflection, of course, but Hahn gave me much on which to pray and reflect.<br />Hahn writes in a lucid, conversational style; it's almost as though, in reading the book, you were having a one-on-one talk with him.  He places Mary in the context of the entire Bible, in &quot;types&quot; from Eve onward, and shows that regarding her as Mother is not unusual (though it IS extraordinary--in a good way, that is).  On this latter point, Hahn makes a particularly insightful argument about family and the Holy Family--surely God did not intend for us to be without a mother.<br />For those not so well versed in the Bible, I would suggest having one at your side.  Hahn makes frequent biblical references, and after reading one of his points, you just want to read the original text.  And that's one of the beauties and joys of this book--that it fills the reader with a desire to return to the Word and meditate on its richness and meaning.<br />The book is not long and can be read quickly if you want.  But go slowly and spend some time with it.  The experience is truly rewarding.	2003-04-17

Often, Huey Long and Father Coughlin are glossed over in US history textbooks and are given the \\"extremist\\" or \\"radical\\" label.  These might not be entirely incorrect descriptions, but using them misses the depth of the national movements that rose up around these two figures and ignores the many followers they had.<br />It is interesting to see who was supporting Long and Coughlin.  Their movements were not, as one might expect, composed of the dispossed or the bottom-of-the-barrel poor.  Rather, they usually attracted people on the lower fringes of the middle class--people who had something and knew what it was like not to have it, people who feared losing their new status.  Long and Coughlin expressed a sense of loss, too.  They bemoaned the death of community-based business and local trade and their replacement with a growing number of chain stores and big businesses.  Cold, distant, impersoal relationships now replaced the personal ties that bound communities together.  They focused on economic issues--such as old-age pensions and Long's Share Our Wealth program.  They placed blame on and demonized the \\"usual suspects.\\"  They proposed radical change and yet distanced themselves from socialists and Communists--especially Coughlin.  Ultimately, they failed to create an enduring ideological movement, but one still cannot help wondering what course the 1936 election would have taken had Long not been assassinated in 1935.<br />The picture of Franklin Roosevelt that emerges here is that of a cunning and shrewd political operator.  He deftly maneuvered the political waters and co-opted both Long and Coughlin.  He adopted pieces of their programs--never the entire thing, but just enough to siphon support from his potential rivals.  He maintained an ambiguous relationship with Coughlin and played on the priest's desire for power and attention--frequently ignoring him but slyly using him, for example, to garner the Catholic vote.  He similarly cozied up to Long in the 1932 election, since the Louisiana politician had growing appeal, especially in regions of the south.<br />Overall, this is a fascinating book, based on excellent scholarship and many insightful analyses.	2003-04-15

White wrote that they &quot;were like the time you put in in a doctor's waiting room, years of fumbling with old magazines and unconfirmed suspicions, the ante years, the time of the moist palm and the irresolution.&quot;  The picture Ketchum paints of the 1938-1941 period conveys just that sense of uncertainty and doubt and suspicion.  The country was on the upswing from the Depression (though only the war would shake it off finally).  The 1930s were a time of tremendous social and political change, at home and abroad, and Americans in 1938 were not as confident or optimistic, for good reason, as they had been in 1929 or as they would be in 1945.  And then came the war.  First abroad and then spreading to engulf the United States.<br />Ketchum focuses largely on that story--how the United States dealt with its role in the world, or what exactly that role should be.  These were years of intense debate, especially between isolationists and those who supported more active support for the Allies.  Over time, the American people grew more supportive of intervention, but it took the shock of Pearl Harbor to draw the US into military involvement.<br />Ketchum covers the gamut of American life in these years--culture, politics, society.  The book is part history, but it is also part memoir.  We get a sense of what it was like to be a young person in this period, to be among those who would be called upon to serve.  Ketchum was a member of the Yale class of 1943, and his descriptions of life on campus and of the debates going on there were excellent and shed a new and interesting light on events.<br />Highly recommended.	2003-04-15
US	44497166	RQ3I7WEPAKN0P	0679640509	459507287	Communism: A History (Modern Library Chronicles)	Books	5	15	19	N	N	simply excellent	This is the first book in the Modern Library Chronicles series I have read, and I finished it quite impressed.  If others are half as well done, then I'm in for a real treat when I grab the next one.  Of course, Richard Pipes' reputation precedes him, and he certainly adds much to this slim and excellent volume.  His prose is crystal clear.  His argument is both well presented and extremely well documented.  This book, though short, is full of facts, all pointing to Pipes' predominant argument--that Communism, both a pseudoscience and pseudoreligion, is a flawed and contradictory system.<br />Pipes treats Communism as three \\"types\\":  ideal, program, and regime.  The ideal, that of full social equality, stretches back to Plato and was carried on, to varying degrees, by figures such as Thomas More, John Locke, and Helvetius.  In the 1800s, Marx and Engels proposed their program--abolishing private property.  And with Lenin and the Soviet Union, Communism as a regime comes into being.  It is this third type that occupies most of the book.<br />Pipes explains the rise of Communism in Russia--why, for example, it took place there despite its not being industrialized.  He then traces its institutionalization under Lenin and then Stalin, the terror it perpetuated, the lives it took.  (And he makes the sometimes forgotten point that the Communist Party had MUCH to do with the rise to power of the Nazis in Germany.)  His attentions then turn to attempts at Communism elsewhere--China and the Third World.  Pipes' approach is somewhat centered on the Soviet Union, but this is fair, given that the USSR looms the largest in the story of Communism and given its role in attempting to promote revolution abroad.  The system, Pipes argues, is bound to fail because the equality it seeks to create requires an enforcement apparatus that destroys equality, and because, in times of conflict (which Communism requires), ethnic and territorial loyalties dominate those of class.  It is, moreover, too rigid, unable to correct itself, inflexible.<br />I would have liked to have read a bit more about the philosophical development of Marxism and Communism, particularly in connection with liberation theologies in the Third World.  But this hardly detracts from the book, which is meant only as a summary and introduction, to whet the appetite for further reading.  And at this, it is quite excellent.	2003-04-05

Even so, and as full of analysis and information as this book is, it is eminently readable and is likely the defining book on the social effects of World War I in the United States.  It is, in short, an extraordinarily fine work of academic history.<br />In the years preceding American entry into WWI, Progressivism dominated the political and social landscape.  Advocating any number of platforms--from prohibition of alcohol and women's suffrage, to the causes of labor and agriculture, Progressives were extremely active.  At the root of their activism, in a sense, was what the role of the federal government was and what it would be.  In many ways, as Kennedy points out, World War I weighed in on this question in favor of greater government involvement.  During the war, the US government entered a number of spheres of American life and exerted a controlling influence.<br />And yet, for this involvement and for the promise it held for the pursuit of Progressive ideals, the war effort left much undecided, and following the war, much of the gains were lost.  The cause of organized labor had been gutted by wartime efforts to guarantee continued production and remained in shambles at the war's end.  Prohibition gained ground, but on the whole, Kennedy argues that the cause of Progressivism and social reform suffered a serious blow as a result of the war.  And the question about the government's role was far from settled; the 1920s witnessed a return to virtual non-involvement.  This, along with other issues, would only find resolution during the Depression and the New Deal.  In this way, then, Over Here is, indeed, prologue to his Freedom from Fear, which covers the eventual answering of many of these lingering questions--including the legitimacy of a more active federal government.<br />Over Here is essential reading for anyone interested in modern American political and social history.	2003-04-05

These words briefly summarize the main argument and theme of Schweizer's admirable effort:  that Reagan's anti-Communism was well-thought-out and well-argued, based on facts and experience, that it was not blind or unthinking.  From his early exposure to radical Communists in Hollywood, Reagan recognized the danger that the ideology and its adherents posed to freedom and humanity.  He felt it personally--for example, when he received death threats and kept watch over his family at night, with a gun nearby.  From these initial experiences, too, Reagan showed a degree of courage, such as his willingness to cross directly through a picket line to go to work, rather than use the hidden entrance recommended by security.  Certainly, it's quite a step from opposing Communist activists at movie studios to staring down the Soviet Union.  But the two are linked.<br />For the thirty to thirty-five years preceding his presidency, Reagan thought about his position and, indeed, gave it much thought.  He interacted with intellectuals and government officials, including Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon (despite Reagan's opposition to detente).  During his tenure as governor, he was active in enforcing law and order in California against Vietnam protesters.  And in the 1970s, between the end of his governorship and the beginning of his presidency, Reagan penned a series of radio addresses (compiled in the book \\"In His Own Hand\\") on a number of topics, including Communism.  These writings show how deeply Reagan had pondered this issue (and others), and how intelligent and talented he truly was.  I was also struck by the influence Arthur Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon\\" had on him, how it demonstrated that the Soviets' tactic was fear; others such as Edward Teller have mentioned that book as having a decisive influence on their thinking.<br />My only complaint is that it there is too much Cold War and too little Reagan.  Of course, the Cold War is considerably important to the story.  After all, it was the backdrop to Reagan's intellectual development and the reality faced by his administration.  Still, at times, I felt that the material dealing solely with events of the Cold War--going pages at a time without mentioning the book's subject--might have been trimmed down a bit.<br />All in all, though, this is a readable book with many interesting facts and insights into Reagan's mind, and it puts to rest any of the notions that Reagan lacked depth of mind.  Read together with Peggy Noonan's \\"When Character Was King\\" to round out Reagan's full character, this book paints a convincing picture of a man who looms large in American history and in the history of the Cold War.	2003-04-04

This was probably not the best book to read this early in the journey to Rome, since it presumes something of a knowledge of the Church and its &quot;crisis&quot; in modern times, particularly after Vatican II--unlike, say, an introduction to Catholic theology or liturgy.  In that respect, then, not being a Catholic, I was probably limited in what I could take from the book.<br />Nevertheless, I found it extremely fascinating and worthwhile.  For starters, Ratzinger's understanding of the Church speaks directly to why I was drawn to it in the first place.  He conveys a sense of the Church's community of believers, the communion of saints, emphasizing the very important communal aspects of the Catholic faith and suggesting that theology is not just a matter for individuals and academicians and &quot;theologians&quot;--it is pursued as a community.  He describes this community, this unity quite wonderfully, I think:  &quot;harmonic wholeness.&quot;<br />His description as the Church going up against the powerful cultural forces of our time was also quite convincing and appealing.  Indeed, the Church stands virtually alone against the tide of permissivity.  Ratzinger discusses the difficulties the Church was facing in the mid-1980s, from feminism and liberation theology to the dangers of extreme individualism.  His proposed solutions are probably not surprising to those familiar--among others:  not an abandonment of Vatican II but a discovery of its true spirit; a re-affirmation of traditional doctrines (such as the Virgin Mary); a recognition that the Church is not democratic but sacramental and hierarchical instead; and a restoration of the virtues of motherhood and virginity.<br />All in all, a great survey of the Catholic Church's position in the modern world, which deals with problems as well as possible answers.  Moreover, Ratzinger speaks, either directly or indirectly, tothe problems facing the world in general, and his solutions could just as easily be applied in that broader context.  This book, then, in many ways, transcends its intended Catholic audience--a true achievement.	2003-02-06

Chesterton's Masterpiece, the Man Who Was Thursday	Books	5	24	26	N	N	an overlooked classic	The obvious (and probably most common) comparison is to Joseph Conrad's \\"The Secret Agent.\\"  Both explore anarchy and revolution and have at their centers double agents.  In many ways, though, the two works don't compare.  Conrad's work is much darker; his London is infinitely bleaker and grosser than Chesterton's.  Indeed, Conrad spends much more time describing his settings and creating the dark mood.  Moreover, Conrad is more concerned than Chesterton with the psychological motivations underlying anarchy.  These are not at all shortcomings in Chesterton's brilliant work; the two writers, each excellent in their own ways, simply focused on different things and had different goals and lessons to teach.<br />On its surface, \\"The Man Who Was Thursday\\" is the tale of a detective who infiltrates the inner circle of a group of anarchists and assumes a position on its board, whose seven members all bear names of days of the week.  Syme, the detective, is Thursday; the mysterious, enigmatic leader is Sunday.  Much of the fun of this book is in the twists and turns, so I won't give anything away.  Some of the surprises (or revelation) are predictable, but many are not, and one typically builds on all the rest--keeping even the most predictable of them fresh and intriguing.  At a deeper level, Chesterton explores the nature of good and evil, of fate and free will, of order and chaos, and also of faith.  Indeed, Chesterton's vision of Christianity penetrates his work, sometimes explicitly (particularly the concluding chapters) and often implicitly and more symbolically.  It underlies much of the book.<br />\\"Thursday\\" is a difficult book to understand, and the allegory is not easy to see or decipher.  This is certainly a book that deserves many re-readings.  On this note, Martin Gardner's introduction and notes provide a great framework for beginning to penetrate the book's deeper meanings.  Moreover, his descriptions of the relevant geography and landmarks of London prove both helpful and fascinating.<br />This is a true masterpiece, unfortunately overlooked by far too many who have never heard of Chesterton or who don't know he wrote excellent fiction in addition to his fine Christian apologetics.  Anyone stands to profit from reading \\"The Man Who Was Thursday.\\"  And this edition only enhances the experience.	2003-01-20

But the \\"spine\\" is there, and Johnson traces the development of the Church from the time of Christ (with some brief background information on Jewish sects before Christ) through, approximately, Vatican II and Humanae Vitae.<br />The Catholic Church is more the topic of the book than is Christianity in general.  Perhaps this results from the age of Catholicism versus the age Protestant denominations.  After all, for three quarters of the period covered, the Catholic Church was virtually alone on the scene, at least as far as Western Europe (Johnson's focus) was concerned.  But even in the post-Reformation era, Protestantism receives attention that pales in comparison to that given Catholicism.  And the Eastern Orthodox churches are mentioned virtually not at all after the 1054 split, except to compare the Church's adherence to Latin while the Orthodox churches accepted the native tongues of its members.  All of this is fine, of course, but the title is somewhat misleading in this regard.  A better title might have been \\"A History of Catholicism\\" or \\"A History of Christianity in the West.\\"<br />That said, this is still an excellent book, and the material it includes is examined excellently.  Theological doctrine and debates necessarily enter the story (such as the Trinity and the Pope's infallibility), but this is not a history of doctrine and its development.  Rather, Johnson focuses on the evolution of Christianity (or, if you like, the Church) as a political, social, legal, and economic institution, one centered in Western Europe but also attempting to radiate outward--through the Crusades, missionary work, and, later, attempting to establish a foothold in North America.  A key element of the story is the church-versus-state relationship, which changed over time.  At times, the Church was the dominant player, and at other times, it yielded much authority to European monarchs.  Much of the history witnesses series of give-and-take between church and state and, of course, concludes with the triumph of the state and also with the virtual separation of the world into two (sometimes competing) spheres.<br />This is an excellent treatment of Christian history, summarizing in 500 pages what could legitimately fill (and has filled) many thousands of pages.  It is more than mere narrative as well, for Johnson includes many insightful analyses and draws thought-provoking conclusions.  The book does not assume too much pre-existing knowledge of the subject (although having read the Bible, or at least Acts, would probably be helpful for the first part of the book), and it serves as a very fine starting point for studying the history of Christianity.	2003-01-20

But beyond chronicling scientific and technological developments, the book explores the world of American politics and government and how it was influencing the physics side of things.  More importantly to the work's argument, however, Herken also delves into the scientists personal lives--their friendships, their hobbies, their activities.  To that end, he focuses on three:<br />--Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the driven, imperious, South Dakotan who directed the Rad(iation) Lab at Berkeley and created--ruled, some would say--a \\"cyclotron republic\\" there<br />--Edward Teller, the temperamental Hungarian emigre who fled to the United States from Communists in his native land and from Nazis in Germany, and who, to the exclusion of almost everything else, pursued the H-bomb at Los Alamos and then at Livermore (an interesting anecdote describes how, at the Trinity test, he stunned his companions by putting on suntan lotion, gloves, and welder's glasses)<br />--J. Robert \\"Oppie\\" Oppenheimer (according to Herken, the \\"J\\" stands for nothing; other sources have it as \\"Julius\\"), the introspective director of the Manhattan Project with an affinity for Eastern religions and leftist, even Communist, causes<br />These three figure prominently in the tale which begins at Berkeley in the 1930s, where the great physicists of the day began to coalesce.  World War II took most of them to Los Alamos in some way or another, although Lawrence's work was mostly at the Rad Lab developing ways of enriching uranium.  By the end of the war, splits were beginning to appear as the scientists became more aware of the political and moral implications of their work.  While Oppenheimer became something of a celebrity in the nation at large and served as an advisor to a handful of government commissions and committees, Lawrence fervently lobbiedfor government funding for bigger and faster cyclotrons, and Teller ever more energetically pursued his Super.<br />Oppenheimer, who had been loosely affiliated with the Communist Party in the late 1930s, had been under FBI scrutiny--including wiretaps of his phone--ever since he became director at Los Alamos and gained a security clearance then only at Leslie Groves' insistence.  In the mid-1950s, as the penetration of the bomb project came to light, and in the wake of the McCarthy hearings, and after Oppenheimer had voiced his opposition to the Super, the physicist's political leanings began to concern government officials.  Hearings were held, which included somewhat ambiguous though negative testimony from Teller, and Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked.<br />Of course, this is just the briefest of summaries.  Other books, notably and admirably Rhodes', have detailed both bomb programs, but Herken's adds depth to the stories by focusing on the personal relationships between the scientists and demonstrating how they impacted events.  Loyalty was important.  But loyalty to what?  Friends?  Family?  Science?  The government?  Politics?  Ideology?  Humanity?  More often that not, it was a combination--\\"tangled loyalties,\\" as Herken calls it.  And the end result was often ill will or resentment; disagreements over the ends of science often boiled over into broken friendships, or into political conflict.  <br />These men loom large in modern history.  They were giants of nuclear physics as well as of their time.  But they were human, too--flawed giants.  \\"Physicists have known sin,\\" said Robert Oppenheimer.  In response, some years later, Edward Teller wrote, \\"Physicists have known power.\\"  No two statements better capture the status of physics (and physicists) in the world--and the differences separating these two men.	2002-12-20

He was active on the German right before and after World War I, although he distanced himself from the Nazis, intellectually and otherwise, writing the allegorical On the Marble Cliffs (1939), which can be read as a criticism of totalitarianism.  Well into his 40s, he served in the German army during World War II.  In his later life, he was increasingly difficult to pin down politically and was widely known for his interest in butterflies.<br />The Storm of Steel is his memoir of the Great War, first published in 1920, when Juenger was 25.  It is an amazing insight into life on the Western Front, in the trenches, from a firsthand, unfictionalized perspective.  I agree with the previous reader who suggested reading this in conjunction with Remarque's famous novel, All Quiet on the Western Front.  As opposed to that vivid, though fictionalized, account, The Storm of Steel is a very patriotic, nationalistic work (its final words:  \\"Germany lives and Germany shall never go under!\\").  Juenger describes the war in sometimes exuberant, exhilerated terms.  A gas attack during the Somme left everything \\"covered with a beautiful green patina.\\"  An artillery barrage \\"turned the western horizon into a sea of flowers.\\"  The final chapter, and particularly the final several pages, is a stunning literary achievement in its description of the experiences common to his generation and their search to find meaning in the world.	2002-12-18

He's even part of our popular culture (if with slightly insidious connotations) thanks to the film Wall Street.  At any rate, his fame is richly deserved.  Although he discussed his philosophy in terms of war (with mentions of horses and the trappings of battle, for example), much of his work is written in broader language.  His central lesson:  Know your enemy and know yourself.  Everything else emanates from this.  Of course, Sun Tzu's conception of knowledge goes deeper, in a Taost sort of way, to knowing the fonts of being, the nature of existence.  But from it also come the keys to success in war.  Also important is deception (which is, of course, simply manipulation and exploitation of knowledge), as well speed and surprise.  For Sun Tzu, the ideal battle is fought and won without bloodshed; it is essentially waged between two opposing commanders, who attempt to outwit the other.<br />Draw what conclusions you will for the modern world of business and politics, but the bottom line is, this is an enduring classic, with relevance even today.  And Samuel Griffith translates the work admirably, despite the difficulty of translating aphoristic Chinese.	2002-12-17

Bush.  By now, his nicknames and mangling of syllables are legendary.  We all know how much he values loyalty, how his campaign--and now administration--remained tightly focused on its message, how his deep faith influences him.  But anyone who has watched the evening news, even off and on, for the past several years knows all this.  There are no really penetrating insights, no revelations or new understandings of Bush as man or Bush as president.<br />Still, it is nice to have these stories in one place, told and strung together by good reporting.  Bruni does cover a broad (though not necessarily deep) range of Bush, and his attempt to show some sort of continuity or progression from candidacy to presidency is mostly successful--but, again, not too groundbreaking.  Bush easily steals the show, and the laughs in the book come from him rather than from Bruni's sometimes strained efforts to be humorous.  The book also provides fascinating insights into the lives of reporters on the road, as they follow candidates and presidents all across the country and the world, trying to meet deadlines, trying to tread a middle ground between honest, fair reporting and remaining on good terms with the subject.<br />Overall, Ambling Into History is too much retelling, too little analysis.	2002-12-14

It includes six essays.<br />Stephen Vincent Benet, the book's editor, offers the first piece, in which he introduces the theme and the other authors.<br />Erika Mann, daughter of German writer Thomas Mann and refugee in America, provides a series of vignettes, urging America to take a stand against Hitler.<br />McGeorge Bundy, a 1940 graduate of Yale (his essay, in fact, was written as a senior thesis there) and later a Kennedy advisor, surveys opinion in the colleges and charts a middle road between isolationism and extreme interventionism.  War--American involvement, at least--is not inevitable, he says, but should circumstances force entry, it is worth fighting.<br />William L. White, a state legislator from Kansas and journalist, reports on his experiences in Europe and declares that only Americans had the strength of belief in their system and values to match the Nazis.<br />Garrett Underhill recommends more military preparation--a country needs not just the will to fight, but also adequate military preparation (training and equipment).<br />Walter Millis, who had written several highly influential books on the Spanish-American War and World War I, re-assesses some of his opinions and suggests that this may be a necessary war.  Whatever the US does, though, it must unite in that purpose.<br />Overall, a very interesting, informative look at some American opinions before it entered World War II.  This is not a work of history, nor is it unbiased.  These authors are not isolationists.  But therein lies its value.  It is a primary document, a snapshot of one strain of American thought at the time.  It is extremely useful--and fascinating, too.	2002-12-13

However, Federici has written an excellent book that functions wonderfully as an introduction to Voegelin's thought and that would be an excellent companion to have by your side when reading Voegelin himself.  (The glossary of Voegelinian terms is especially helpful in this regard.)<br />Even so, because Voegelin's work is so difficult, so loaded with new terms and complicated ideas, Federici's book also acquires an element of this density--probably unavoidable, but clarity does suffer somewhat at various points.  Nevertheless, what emerges--even in the less clear parts--is a coherent picture of the corpus of Voegelin's work and thought.  He sought to articulate a way out of a crisis that had been precipitated, by and large, by movements, particularly ideologies, that had distorted reality--for example, by immanentizing the transcendent.  His solution, to put it extremely simply, was to revive Western tradition, largely through a greater openness of the soul to transcendent reality, to the past experiences of civilization.<br />Voegelin was not without his critics, but his influence is far-reaching.  Anyone interested in the disease that afflicts the West would do well to turn to Voegelin.  And thanks to Federici, we now have a great starting point to do just that.	2002-12-09

That said, however, Creveld's book provides a very decent, very solid introduction to and overview of military thought, and I do think that this was the purpose of the volume--to make the material accessible and enjoyable to a very broad audience.<br />The opening timeline, I thought, was extremely helpful, and the illustrations throughout were, contrary to what some others have said, quite useful and also very vivid.  The maps, diagrams, paintings, and photos definitely enhanced the text.  All the greats are here, and their ideas are seen in practice and also placed, if briefly, in their broader political and social perspectives.<br />For those already well versed in military history and strategy, you will probably want to look elsewhere (unless you're a Creveld devotee or like lots of illustrations peppered throughout your history).  But if you're looking for a dependable, not-too dense overview of the history of warfare, I would certainly recommend this as a safe starting point.	2002-12-09

The decade he paints is one mired in postmodernism and relativism, one that denies that man is imperfect and not perfectible.  90s culture was basically a wasteland, driven mostly by marketability and greed, in which previous conceptions of the family, or of art, or of excellence, were eroded and replaced.  &quot;Nothingness&quot; (a la Seinfeld) was celebrated.  It was a media-driven era.<br />London dedicates the majority of his book to education--kindergarten through college.  Curricula were turned into mulicultural and postmodern nightmares.  Other cultures were to be studied either to the exclusion or outright denigration of the US.  Feminist ideas turned physical education classes into &quot;genderless&quot; activity times, instead of rigorous classes in physical exercise and well-being.  They also ate away at high school athletics, as girls sought to join football teams.  All notions of excellence were fading away, as educators feared offending people or elevating one above another, or insisted that regardless of performance, all were equal somehow.<br />I personally would have enjoyed a section devoted to government and politics in the 1990s and how they fit in with everything else.  Still, from what London has presented here, it's not too difficult, I suppose, to figure out that the transformation of politics (and the Clinton business) are part and parcel of these other trends.<br />All in all, the book is a solid (and slim) overview of this decade that witnessed unprecedented economic growth and prosperity, even as culture and society sank deeper and deeper into the ashbin.  The two developments are not entirely unrelated, and in many ways, the trends of the 1990s only continue into 2002.	2002-12-09

It is extremely well-written and well-argued and draws upon a lifetime of scholarship.  <br />His biographical vignettes flesh out the personal characteristics and ideas of key figures (great description of John Adams:  &quot;driven and uneasy&quot;).  Particularly interesting among these were the two lesser known figures:  Thomas Hutchinson and the unknown Harbottle Dorr.  The conservative (especially in temperament) Hutchinson found himself unable to respond to--effectively, if at all--or understand revolutionary ideas or motivations.  Harbottle Dorr, who I suspect will never appear in a textbook, kept a fascinating collection of Boston newspapers, which he indexed and annotated throughout the period; his story is a deep insight into what was driving &quot;regular&quot; revolutionaries and how they were engaging the ideas of the time.<br />The thematic essays are also particularly good.  &quot;1776 in Britain and America:  A Year of Challenge--A World Transformed&quot; was especially enlightening.  It places American events and ideas in the broader context of what was occurring in Britain; this annus mirabilis witnessed the publication not only of Paine's &quot;Common Sense,&quot; but also Gibbon's &quot;Decline and Fall,&quot; Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations,&quot; and Bentham's &quot;Fragment on Government,&quot; among several other lesser known works.  This was a world in flux, with ubiquitous economic growth and a population explosion--as well as vast movements of people.  Existing government structures were insufficient in dealing with these dramatic changes, and so new ideas and ideologies--building on previous authors, such as Locke--circulated to address the new problems.  The other thematic essays, in some way or another, also attempt to place the ideas and themes in a broader perspective--either of the physical world or the world of ideas.<br />All in all, a great compilation of essays.	2002-12-09

This book reads almost like a novel, and yet it is a work of history--with solid research and scholarship, at that.  <br />Gross argues that the Revolution provided Concord an opportunity to re-assert control over the community and its destiny.  In the years preceding 1775-1776, great changes were sweeping across the colonies, particularly in traditional New England towns like Concord.  For example, there was the problem of decreasing supplies of land, and fathers, with sometimes large numbers of sons, had difficulty providing for all his heirs (without dividing the land and, hence, making it less sustainable).  Other issues were occurring specifically in Concord--such as the desire of its residents farther from the town to hire their own minister.  So threatened, Concord was experiencing not just stasis but actual decline in these pre-Revolution years.<br />Therefore, with all these fluctuations and challenges, participation in the Revolution offered Concord a chance to seize initiative and regain control over its political and communal life, to restore its autonomy.  Gross writes, \\"The men of 1775 had not gone to war to promote change but to stop it.\\"	2002-12-09

He speaks for the values that still mean something to most of this country--faith, family, and freedom.  He sees clearly through the relativistic mish-mash of modern times and pulls no punches.  No, his ideas aren't extraordinarily complex; Hannity is no philosopher.  But that's the point.  Conservatism, as understood by regular people, is a simple thing, recognizing the simple truths of reality and existence--only to seem them obscured and distorted and even destroyed by the Left and, sometimes, too, by Republicans.<br />The book reads easily and is part chronicle of his encounters with liberals, part exposition of his beliefs.  It covers the gamut of today's issues:  immigration, education, the environment, national defense, taxes, the media.  He paints an accurate picture of the American left as mostly hypocritical, morally blind \\"Kool-Aid drinkers,\\" whose ideas are dangerous and threatening to all that the country has held dear for over two hundred years.  He tenaciously defends what he believes and does not fear admitting his faith in God and the role that his Christian beliefs play in his life.  \\"Let Freedom Ring\\" is an admirable defense of conservative values and moral clarity.  It will no doubt make some people uncomfortable and offend many others--but that's because it rings with such truth.	2002-12-08

And yet its deeper meaning to Kreeft's argument soon becomes clear.  Jihad--an inner pursuit of truth and the outward performance of holy deeds--is pursued by people of all faiths, if not by that name.  Surely some common ground must exist.<br />Kreeft does not advocate surrendering principles; most believers simply are not going to do so.  Catholics are not going to abandon the real presence in the Eucharist; Protestants will continue to reject the infallibility of the Pope.  Muslims won't abandon Mohammed.  Jews are not likely to accept Christ as Messiah.  But yet there remain good reasons for these faiths to unite--in an alliance, while retaining their beliefs--against the common enemy that destroys our culture, that consumes decency and morality and faith, that kills the unborn.<br />No, this is not a book for the weak of heart or mind (or most liberals).  Kreeft pulls no punches, and isn't afraid to call a spade a spade, to say things that will no doubt garner him the \\"fundamentalist\\" or \\"fanatic\\" or \\"extremist\\" label.  But this, at root, is a work of hope, of a cautious optimism, of facing adversity with a smile.  With the smile of assurance only faith can offer.	2002-12-06

Overall, it is a decent summary of the period (if 700 pages can be termed a summary) and could easily and confidently be used as a textbook for almost any modern history course, either as the central text or as a complement (I read it in class focusing on the Cold War).  It touches on events in all parts of the world and also on social, economic, political, cultural, and technological trends.  Reynolds does a particularly good job of chronicling the years of revolution 1989-1991, when so much was happening in so many different places.<br />However, for all its utility and detail, Reynolds' political opinions appear far too often--enough that it detracts from the book.  Certain words and phrases (such as family values) receive the scornful, mocking quotation marks that academics often use.  The tobacco industry is attacked.  The American gun lobby is also criticized, and their positions result from a \\"selective reading of the Second Amendment.\\"  The Reagan administration, among other things, is termed \\"fanatically antigreen.\\"  \\"Many\\" senior Republicans who sought to impeach Clinton were also adulterers.  Samuel Huntington is reduced to an opponent of multiculturalism.  Margaret Thatcher responded to the Falklands crisis not only with resolution but also \\"relish.\\"  Vietnam protesters were \\"dignified.\\"<br />I am also not quite convinced that his linking of various fundamentalisms (the American Christian Right with Islamic fundamentalists, for example) is appropriate or accurate.  And his paean to series editor Paul Kennedy was a bit overdone.  Beyond the political bias and some minor flaws of analysis, the book functions fairly well at least as a timeline and also as a generally cohesive picture of the past 50 years.	2002-12-05

Ross's excellent compilation of original documents traces the development of U.S. strategy in World War II, dividing the plans into three spheres:  Pre-War Plans, War in North Africa and Europe, and War in the Pacific.  Although Ross provides brief contextual commentary, the documents speak for themselves.  Several versions of the Rainbow war plans are included, and familiar code-named plans such as Shingle, Neptune, Anvil, Cartwheel, and Iceberg are included, among others.  Most fascinating to me was Operation Downfall, the invasion of the Japanese home islands that (fortunately) never was.  To read of the massive numbers of troops, ships, and planes assigned for such an invasion (in its two phases of Olympic and Coronet) is sobering, if not harrowing.  I trust this volume, which is the first time all these plans have been published in one place, will be of great value to those interested in war planning as well as in military history and strategy.

It is the tale of the three Karamazov brothers--Alyosha, the pious spiritualist; Ivan, the tormented, calculating atheist and author of that famed passage, The Grand Inquisitor; and Mitya, the sensualist involved in a twisted sort of love triangle in which the participants maliciously chicane one another--and their illegitimate half-brother Smerdyakov, sickly and conniving.  The central plot focuses on the murder of the brothers' father, Fyodor, and the trial of the suspected murderer (whom I will not name, lest I spoil the book for any would-be readers).  Of course, the novel transcends mere murder mystery and courtroom drama; indeed, these elements serve merely as a background for what truly concerns Dostoevsky, the battle for the soul, in which the forces of modern ideologies (e.g. socialism) struggle against the forces of religion, specifically orthodox Christianity.  This war for the spirit wreaks havoc on the individual, disorients and incapacitates him; in fact, the most interesting character in the book is not Dostoevsky's declared hero, Alyosha, but rather his brother Ivan, the atheist, whose contemplation of the lack of moral restraint effected by God's absence places him in the most fragile of mental states, which collapses when he must make a moral judgment.  It was Dostoevsky's genius to recognize that socialism is more than a form of labor organization, that it is \\"above all an atheistic phenomenon, the modern manifestation of atheism, one more tower of Babel built without God, not in order to reach out toward heaven from earth, but to bring heaven down to earth.\\"  And there lies his enduring relevance to modern times, over one hundred years after his death.  Communism and socialism, indeed, have been virtually routed as viable political and economic systems.  But the fight of the West versus Communism was not simply a political-economic one; it was, as Dostoevsky would have recognized--and, indeed, as his modern heirs such as Whitaker Chambers and Alexander Solzhenytsin understood--merely a continuation of that great war for the human soul.  And that struggle was not, and has not been, won.  For those who wish to understand that fight and to take it up with the foe, Dostoevsky is the essential starting point.	2002-11-16

In this slim volume, Professor McClay develops a framework through which we might begin to view the unique entity that is American history (and America itself).  McClay laments, with some justification, the fact that students at the high school and college levels are usually taught U.S. history as a string of facts or periods; as a corrective, McClay selects a (non-exhaustive) set of themes, \\"windows\\" as he calls them, which undergird the discipline:  equality, religion, liberty, nature, urbanism, the frontier, and federalism, to name but a few.  It is a work neither of the philosophy of history nor of historiography; nor is it jargon-ridden or overly abstract.  Rather, its simplistic treatment of the basic building blocks of American history easily serves as a solid starting point for more detailed studies of our past, not to mention the many fine books to which it refers the reader for further perusal.  Indeed, this is its purpose as well as its strongest element.	2002-11-16
US	44497166	R1RF09H6PWCNWT	0375705244	406271874	Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation	Books	5	1	2	N	N	popular history with substance	While devoid of neither analysis nor footnotes, Ellis's work is predominantly in the vein of \\"popular\\" history, clearly written for a wider readership--one, indeed, which has recently been excited about precisely this era.  With this general audience in mind, Ellis has crafted a riveting narrative account of the early Republic, during which the future and endurance of the young nation was anything but certain, focusing on the personal relationships--collaborations, friendships, hostilities--among the Founders.  We begin with the Hamilton-Burr duel, which serves, Ellis writes without much elaboration, to frame the other \\"vignettes,\\" and conclude with the Adams-Jefferson correspondence, in between witnessing the resolution of the tensions surrounding the location of the national capital (which was, at this point, still located in New York) and Hamilton's state debt assumption plan at a dinner, organized by Jefferson, with Hamilton and Madison; the \\"silence\\" on the slavery issue; Washington's all-important Farewell Address; and the years of somewhat turbulent party politics as Jefferson and Madison \\"double-teamed\\" President Adams.  Ellis tends too much to let these narratives speak for themselves, which they partially do, but a more detailed conclusion, tying them all together and fleshing them out in a more thorough, nuanced analysis, would have been appreciated.  Aside from the absence of such a conclusion, I can only complain about Ellis's reading of John Adams's thought and proclaiming him to be some sort of early de-constructionist, a proposition that is difficult for me to swallow.  Nevertheless, Ellis's portrayal of these critical years of American history is generally fair and balanced, and his argument that two competing versions of the founding and the Revolution--Adams versus Jefferson--existed then and now is a sound one.	2002-11-16

Indeed, the &quot;common people&quot; (including women, slaves, and Indians) are too often overlooked in histories of the period, and their roles were critical.  For example, the HUGE influence slaves had on how the war was fought in the South is sadly ignored, despite the fact that no understanding of that aspect is complete without it.  That said, the book is not the whole story and is best read in combination with a work focusing on the &quot;great men&quot; and events &quot;at the top&quot;--perhaps Gordon Wood or Bernard Bailyn.  Such a combination, I think, would provide a fuller portrayal.  My major complaint with the book is its inclusion of page upon page of source material.  I understand that for some this is a strong point of the work and that Raphael is trying to let these common folk speak for themselves.  But the extraordinarily long quotations (sometimes pages in length) prevent Raphael's own voice and analysis from coming through.  And in my opinion, the lengthy quotations from secondary sources could have been eliminated and summarized.  He would have been well advised to limit the direct quotations and focus on a more in-depth analysis.  After all, if one wanted to read straight primary sources, there are collections of documents available.  But these flaws notwithstanding, the book deserves a read, if only to fill in the gaps left by high school history courses.	2002-11-14

Sandoz first gives the historical and religious background of Dostoevsky and the Russia he knew, placing Dostoevsky's thought in the particular (and peculiar?) character of Russian Orthodox Christianity, with its roots in old Slavic cults.  He then launches into an explication of the Legend, understanding it in distinctly biblical terms.  His discussion of the &quot;threeness&quot; of the tale (he finds dozens of triplets throughout) is quite interesting.  But more than an analysis of Dostoevsky, it is an insight into the nihilism of modern times.  The solution to the crisis lies in returning political science to a search (zetema) for truth.  &quot;Political Apocalypse&quot; is a step in that direction.	2002-11-14

He attempts to \\"to speak for life and growth, amid all the mess of destruction and disintegration.\\"  Modern times have witnessed the triumph of nihilism and the advent of a new sort of barbarism and secularism.  Excellence no longer means anything, and mediocrity is promoted.  Vulgarity, profanity, obscenity, and promiscuity are worshipped (as evidenced by Woodstock II, to which Panichas devotes an essay).  Current literary and social criticism does not help the situation, denying standards and enshrining the dethronement of the spirit.  Panichas suggests that restoration, if it is at all possible, will result from a return to criticism in the vein of T.S. Eliot or Russell Kirk--true men of letters who fought the good fight, who battled for the \\"permanent things.\\"  He also adduces a string of writers who understood this need for moral and spiritual value--Joseph Conrad, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Czeslaw Milosz, and Simone Weil, among others.  Panichas himself must surely rank among those fighting the good fight, and his book, without a doubt, should be the starting point for anyone interested in repairing our culture.	2002-11-14

It may seem like a small point, but I really love the typeset used.  And the prefatory material, especially that of Robert Kaplan, is particularly good.  The selection of Lord Jim and Nostromo was also well done, for it juxtaposes two of Conrad's best and, perhaps, most representative works.  On the one hand, there's Lord Jim, largely psychological and personal, in which the title character struggles with, and constantly returns to, a trying moment in which he acted questionably.  On the other, while no less psychological, there's Nostromo, which enters the realm of politics, revolution, and ideology--a more mature Conrad and certainly much more complex, stylistically and thematically.  The works themselves, of course, deserve five stars, but so, too, does this stunning Modern Library edition.	2002-11-14

American military thought was dominated by this Swiss strategist, and The Art of War was required reading at West Point--nearly all the Civil War generals were read in Jomini, and Grant was rumored to have carried a copy in his pocket during the Virginia campaign.  Jomini's work is not exactly the easiest of reads, especially since it assumes more than a working knowledge of the wars of Europe, particularly of Napoleon, and is loaded with historical examples.  Too, its discussion of geometric forms and lines and points and the like can sometimes be confusing.  Nevertheless, some of the history can be skimmed (skipped if you're desperate), and reading will still be profitable.  For much of the strategy is delineated in concrete form separate from the historical case studies.  In essence, Jomini's strategy comes down to concentration against the enemy's decisive points, preferably placing one's entire force against fractions of the enemy's.  It is essential not only to understanding modern military thought generally (Jomini influenced other strategists--Mahan, for example) but also to understanding the American Civil War.  While maneuvers such as Pickett's Charge seem no less pointless, the reasons for them become much more lucid.	2002-11-14

Perhaps things would have turned out a little differently (or maybe not).  At any rate, although the prospects of Communist insurgency in the modern world are probably quite slim, anyone interested in military strategy and/or history would profit from reading this short treatise (only 75 pages).  The central element of Mao's guerrilla warfare is to destroy the enemy while preserving one's own forces.  To accomplish this, speed, deception, and other methods are necessary, and here, Mao draws largely from Sun Tzu.  However, Mao makes clear the importance of politics.  Nearly everyone is familiar with Clausewitz's dictum on war and policy (too often quoted out of context), but Mao brings it to a new level, recognizing that guerrilla warfare is both military AND political.  Hence, guerrilla units must have political and military leadership, and special pains must be taken in order to secure the support of the people, who are the basis of any successful struggle.  While its direct applicability may diminish, Mao's book will retain value in its discussion of the political nature of conflict and of the role of ideology--and, thus, how ideology may be attacked and countered.  This latter point remains especially pertinent in our fight against Islamism.	2002-11-14

Weaver, writing here in the late 1940s, perceived a culture that was declining, and one can only wonder what he would have thought about modern society, in which traditional values and order have so eroded that they bear no resemblance even to the &quot;diseased&quot; culture of the 1940s.  A restoration of piety, tradition, values, honor, and chivalry would surely serve us well today, if only modern man would heed Weaver's warnings, which resonate as loudly now as they did in 1948.	2002-02-28

In short, this is NOT a good book for an introduction to presidential politics and leadership.  For a more readable and still highly regarded account, Neustadt's seminal work is a good choice.  However, none of this is to say that Skowronek's book is not brilliant--it is, and reading it carefully is a very profitable experience and will enhance anyone's understanding of the presidency, agree with Professor Skowronek or not.  Through all the technical references, Skowronek proposes a paradigm for assessing presidential leadership:  Reconstruction, Disjunction, Articulation, and Pre-emption, all of which are based on the nature of the government and its commitments (vulnerable or resilient) and on the president's relationship to that regime (opposed or affiliated).  Reconstruction results when presidents are opposed to a vulnerable regime--here are the &quot;great&quot; presidents:  Lincoln, FDR, and Reagan, for example.  Affiliation with a vulnerable regime produces Disjunction.  Articulation results from affiliation with a resilient regime.  And Pre-emption is the product of opposition to a resilient regime.  Of course, this merely scratches the surface of Skowronek's argument, for which he argues quite well and which he approaches from a fairly historical perspective.  I highly recommend this for anyone wishing to gain a deeper, fuller understanding of presidential leadership, especially in considering how much a president's skills affect what type of leader he is and how much circumstances shape his presidency.	2002-02-22

Winik's narrative is gripping and moves quickly, covering the gamut of social, political, and military history.  Moreover, he places the events of that month in broader historical contexts.  Connections are made to the past (e.g. his tie-in to Monticello and Jefferson was masterful) to the Founding Fathers and to the origins of the Civil War; moreover, links are made to what would follow the war, what the country and its people would become.  Most interesting to me was Winik's discussion of the twelve or so hours after Lincoln was incapacitated and before Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president; during those hours, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton governed essentially by military decree, and it was anything but certain that Johnson would, in fact, become president and remain so.  (There were only shaky precedents regarding succession.)  Through Winik's multi-faceted, multi-dimensional approach shines what really matters:  the transcendence of American values, which both caused the war and, eventually, brought North and South together and set America on the path to greatness.  A truly enjoyable, fascinating book.	2002-02-13
US	44497166	RP1WOG4FBBA55	0140150951	248392330	The Portable Conservative Reader	Books	5	16	19	N	N	THE conservative compilation	This served as my introduction to intellectual conservatism.  Until I started college, my conservatism (though certainly of a traditionalist, Kirkean sort) was not well-defined, and I was completely unfamiliar with the writings of Kirk or, shockingly enough, of Burke.  However, once in college, I began to associate with other conservatives, many of whom naturally gravitated to Kirk, and so I, too, gave Kirk a try.  Before trying The Conservative Mind I got the reader (more because of the fact that I couldn't find the former than anything else).  Nonetheless, I devoured this book, skipping from piece to piece as the whim caught me.  The Burke readings, I think, are essential, and so is the Kirk piece that concludes the volume, in addition to Kirk's introduction in which he defines conservatism (to the extent that it can be defined at all).  The writings in between are of varying quality, character, and density.  Any conservative can surely find something that suits his fancy, though.  Muggeridge's \\"The Great Liberal Death Wish\\" is a classic--I recommend it to any conservative (especially those who would consider themselves Republicans, as opposed to, say, Buchananites) who sometimes feels outnumbered by his philosophical brethren who support the free market and unregulated capitalism at all costs.  There are dangers in \\"technology,\\" and conservatives are rightly skeptical of industrialism and \\"progress.\\"  The Revolution-era pieces are intriguing and were the first to spark me into considering the true conservatism of the Founders.  The selection from Michael Oakeshott, \\"On Being Conservative,\\" is another interesting one, as well.  In short, this is a fantastic sampling of the corpus of conservative thought and literature.  More than likely, the writings in this book will send you to other books, which will send you to yet more.  But that's the idea, isn't it?	2002-02-13

Books	5	2	9	N	N	an eye-opening read	Although I was born and baptized a Christian, I left my faith and only recently returned within the past year and a half.  I have not intensely studied Bible prophecy, but I welcomed the chance to do so when I received this book as a gift.  The book, though it assumes at least a basic familiarity with Scripture, is written at such a level that one need not be extraordinarily well versed in it and that somewhat complicated topics can be fully understand.  LaHaye and Jenkins clearly wanted to make this accessible to the largest audience possible--and who could blame them?  This is information every person, let alone every Christian, should know.  I am not fully convinced that we ourselves are living in the end times (I don't think the authors are either; for they are the first to admit that it is not possible for humans to know the precise time), but LaHaye and Jenkins do make some very good points, which are cause, at the very least, to suspect that we may perhaps be on the cusp of such an era.  A truly inspiring book.  How can any Christian read this book and not feel charged about their faith and filled with the desire to spread the Good News?	2002-02-12
US	44497166	RI3RFKIB8952E	0226044378	37712178	Making Patriots	Books	5	8	15	N	N	very timely	This slim little book answers some of the questions that have been raised since September 11 (although the book was published some 4 or so months prior to the attacks):  for example, what is patriotism?  how do we inculcate it in our youth?  Berns's answer is one tempered with reason and logic, and he seems to posit--not without good cause--that patriotism must be taught in our schools.  As the previous reviewer said, patriotism--rightly defined, as Berns approaches it--is not jingoism.  In fact, he is quite critical (a little too much, in my opinion) of that famed patriot Stephen Decatur's aphorism \\"my country right or wrong.\\"  Moreover, to those who would question America's role in the world, to those who think we are a force for evil, Berns urges them to think of victory in World War II and an end to communism (at least as far as the USSR goes)--how could those battles have been won without the US.  His brief discussion of the notion of being un-American is particularly insightful; for example, that has a meaning all its own--one never says something is \\"un-French\\" or \\"un-British.\\"  It is, indeed, right, honorable, justified, and expected that we love our country.  Some folks in the media and academia would profit from reading this great little work.	2002-02-12

But as a history major, I can say that it would have served equally well in a course on, say, Colonial New England or Social Life in Colonial America.  It provides fascinating insights into Puritan life--especially into its religious beliefs and practices and the huge role they played in the life of a Puritan.  Moreover, it chronicles the contact of two societies at odds:  Puritans and Native Americans.  Rowlandson's descriptions of her captors are exceedingly interesting and give depth to any consideration of life in early America.  Salisbury's notes and introduction are also quite helpful.  Read as a piece of literature, moreover, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God proves to be a fruitful topic for study, as well as a great complement to its function as an historical document.  Considering my English course included some rather unsavory texts, this one was much appreciated and quite refreshing, too.	2002-02-11

It is carefully researched and documented and is extraordinarily well-written.  While it is very much a work of historical scholarship, it is also written with an eye toward an almost dramatic narrative style (without the embellishments which some of today's \\"popular historians\\" resort to).  To be quite truthful, I got so absorbed by the book, I couldn't put it down.  Of course, you know what happens in the end, but Turner's writing is so vivid and his analyses so keen that it is an absolutely riveting account.  And Turner's general thesis--that Hitler's rise to power was anything but inevitable--is one that he proves (at least as far as I'm concerned) beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Chance played a tremendous role, as did human error and personal folly and misjudgment.  On the topic of personal folly, Turner's assessment of General Schleicher is justifiably harsh.  It is almost unfathomable to ponder, for example, that Hitler's rise might not have happened had Franz von Papen not nursed an inner animosity toward Schleicher, which led him to collaboration with the Nazi leader.  So many if's.  But such is history.  And as far as histories of the Third Reich go, those who want to understand how Hitler became Chancellor of Germany will turn to this phenomenal work.	2002-02-11

I actually read it for American Literature to 1865 (it was assigned in tandem with Uncle Tom's Cabin), and it is currently on the reading list for the modern course.  And I really can't understand why.  The previous reviewer wrote that Mr. Reed was \\"doubly overlooked because he's a truly literate African-American writer AND more so because he's a postmodernist.\\"  I would disagree.  He's overlooked (I hadn't heard of him before my English class) because, quite simply, he cannot write.  Was this supposed to be humorous?  I don't think I cracked a smile.  Moreover--and here the other reviewer was close--his postmodernism just doesn't fly, because contrary to their opinions, there IS objective truth, as recent events have clearly demonstrated.  Mr. Reed is fond of blurring the lines, quite explicitly, between fact and fiction.  If all that's the case, who's to say the neo-Marxism of which Mr. Reed seems to be so fond is not merely fiction?  Not an enjoyable read at all, especially not VERY poorly written scenes dealing with sexuality.  This is certainly not a book I would have read unless assigned (and writing the paper for it was most assuredly like pulling teeth), and I don't feel it has a place on university reading lists, for it is representative of neither American literature nor of good writing.  We need to go back to the basics when authors questioned the order of things without denying Truth itself.	2002-02-11

His book, We Now Know, is an outstanding piece of historical scholarship on the origins of the Cold War and how it played out in the years before the Cuban Missile Crisis.  It is carefully argued and well-documented.  He approaches all sides of the Cold War, including the sometimes overlooked role China played in the early Cold War, not to mention the attention he gives to nuclear weapons and the third world, for example.  Gaddis's writing is very accessible, and he draws many insightful parallels and analogies which aid in understanding even the most complicated of events and theories.  While I think those with at least a basic background in Cold War history would appreciate the book and its interpretations more, it could certainly serve as an introductory text.  Gaddis is the don of modern Cold War historians, and this is nothing short of a masterpiece.  I heartily recommend it.	2001-12-12
