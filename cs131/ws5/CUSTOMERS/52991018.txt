US	52991018	R1GGGKTQKQKERM	0316600806	308164149	White: A Novel	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	Adequate sequel	This book is basically a follow up to Whitcomb's \\"Black\\". In \\"White\\" we are treated to the further adventures of the characters introduced in \\"Black\\". This is a good story but there are layers and layers of conspiracy that are sometimes so obscure they are distracting. This is pretty much a stand alone novel, but it does help if you have read the previous book. I enjoy a good suspense novel that keeps you guessing but this one went a little too far. Even at the end, I wasn't sure who the good guys and the bad guys were. There were also a couple of significant plot events that were not fully explained. I suspect there will be a third novel in this series that will provide more answers than questions. A good read, but wait for the paperback. Also, if at all possible, read \\"Black\\" first.	2005-09-13

Wells novel brought into the 21st century. Evidently the US Mars probes have upset the Martian population and they to earth for a little revenge. The story pretty much follows the original except for a slight twist of the ending which I won't reveal. It is a pretty good story but could have been longer with more fleshing out of the characters who are pretty flat and predictable. It is a fairly quick read with lots of action.	2005-08-24

This time they are after another serial killer wreaking havoc in the south Alabama town. Harry and Carson are a good pair of cops, each with a different attitude toward police work.<br /><br />This is a good follow up novel to the first by Mr. Kerley. The action moves along and the characters are interesting and well developed. There is good bit of wise cracking humor to relieve the tension. I like this series and hope to see more of these two characters.	2005-08-10

The concept of terrorists detonating a nuclear device in the USA should make for scary,thought provoking reading. However the book turned more to a science fiction theme with contrived situations and enormous plot holes. There was not much suspense since the reader knows all the players or can easily figure out who the bad guys are. Not at all up to par with Brown's earlier works. Wait for the paperback.	2005-07-28

This is a stand alone novel which deals with a crime city, apparently somewhere in the midwest, in the late 1950s. The characters are interesting and the story moves along quite well. There are hints of incest, a good ole boy crime syndicate, the mafia, the IRA, early black supremists, the FBI, crooked cops and a neo-Nazi oranization. There should be something here for everyone. That seems to be part of the problem. There are just too many bad guys and no clearly defined good guys, much like the Burke novels. I liked the story but the ending seemed a little abrupt and left some plot lines hanging.	2005-07-15

The novel moves along quite well with the reader constantly wondering if the police can outdo the bad guy. Delorme and Cardinal are a great pair of characters and the author really plays them off each other very convincingly. Cardinal seems to be more fleshed out in this story. We learn more about his distrubed wife and other demons he has to deal with. I would like to see more about the Delorme character in the next novel which can't come too soon. This is a really good series.	2005-06-28

This novel is no disappointment as we meet a \\"retired\\" spy, Martin Odum, who is no longer sure who he really is after playing a number of \\"legends\\" in the service of the CIA. Littell keeps the plot moving and the characters interesting. If you like spy novels with a hint of realism, don't miss this one or any of Littell's novels.	2005-06-28

This story deals with a plot to smuggle a WMD into the USA from Canada. Phil Broker is back trying to deal with his family problems and at the same time help his Delta force wife stop a terrorist threat to the US. The story zips along with little wasted dialogue. The book is nearly impossible to put down. The bad guys are really bad and the good guys are pulling out the stops to get them. Logan can create a truly suspenseful mood that keeps the reader guessing to the very end. Highly recommended.	2005-06-02

I have not read \\"The DaVinci Code\\" so I cannot make a comparison, but I found a lot  of the rather arcane historical and religious expositions rather boring. Some of it was necessary to the plot line, but a lot of time too much detail was provided and really slowed the story. The action scenes were great, if a bit unbelievable. Mr. Rollins has written many great action/adventure stories, but this is not one of the best.	2005-06-02

Once again U.S. Marshal Tim Rackley is back with his deputy sheriff wife to help a couple retrieve their daughter from an insidious cult called the Program. There is plenty of action and suspense as Rackley tries to save Leah from the leader, an arrogant and evil man called \\"Teacher\\" and his zombie like associates. The pace is fast and will keep you reading well into the night. The book is quite horrifying in that it brings back memories of the more notorious cults of the 70s and 80s.

Several of the \\"Icefire\\" characters return to unravel a deadly conspiracy involving NASA and the USAF. The plot will thrill the space race non-believers. The space station action is exceptionally thrilling and the suspense builds as the characters try to uncover a sinister plot to maintain the status quo of the space race between Russia and the United States. The action moves along quite nicely and there are no lags in the plot at all.<br /><br />Like \\"Icefire\\", the book can get a little technical and uses quite a few acronyms but it does not detract from the story. It is really quite fascinating to learn more about space travel and how dangerous it can be. Well worth the read.	2005-04-16

Now we all know that never happens. That aside, this is a pretty good story that starts out great but bogs down about midway through the book. The plot is not inconceivable, but some of the situations the two main characters get into are somewhat implausible. The last half reads more like a action movie screenplay. Still, it is a good read.	2005-04-07

One can feel the fear and uncertainty experienced by the survivors. The author also points out some sobering faults with the way authorities dealt with the situation.

US	52991018	R1QELDIUPAX2F7	0066214130	57180289	State of Fear	Books	3	2	4	N	N	A fair read	I started this book with great anticipation and was justly rewarded for the first few chapters. I then began to think that the author had given the plot and character development a back seat to expressing his own views about the global warming controversy. The book jumps back and forth between what could have been an exciting to plot to a didactic on the fallacies of the global warming scare. I never really understood who the bad guys were and what they were trying to accomplish. Even the \\"good\\" guys agenda was never fully explained. There are many plot ambiguities.<br /><br />I have no problem with an author expressing their views in a novel, but at least be consistent. Either write a fiction novel with the opinions worked into the plot or write a non-fiction novel and lay out the facts with footnotes and references. Mixing the two does not make for a great book.	2005-02-23

Whiteout has all the ingredients for a thrilling suspense story, but never really gets off the ground. A rather contrived romantic interest slows the book down and really contributes nothing to the plot. The last third of the book gets going fairly well, but then seems to end abruptly. It almost seemed as if the author got tired then decided to end the book when there was much more excitement that could have been explored. The elements of a good suspense thriller were there; deadly viruses, horrendous snow storm, terrorists, crooks on the run but these plot lines were not well developed. Still, it is a fair read, just not up to Follett's earlier books.  Wait for the paperback.	2005-01-09

A little research on the internet revealed that his facts were in order and to the point.<br /><br />The story moves along rapidly with detective John Corey and his wife Kate involved in uncovering what really happened to flight 800. Corey was first introduced in \\"Plum Island\\", then reappeared in \\"The Lions Game\\". Like most of DeMille's characters, he is sarcastic, flippant and always stirring up trouble. The action moves along well and you have to pull for Corey and his wife in their dealings with some rather shady government types. It will probably drive the conspiracy nuts wild.<br /><br />This is a good book but leaves the reader hoping for a sequel to see how Corey and Kate deal with the disastrous event and the scary information they uncovered.	2004-12-18

Apparently so.<br /><br />The story moves along at a quick pace with some interesting characters. What is amazing is that the numerous federal law enforcement agencies finally work together to stop a horrendous plot to overthrow the US government.<br /><br />I thought the book was a very enjoyable read, but the editing is awful. I have never read a book from a major publisher with so many grammatical errors, omissions and incorrect punctuation.<br /><br />Some of the sentences had so many errors they made no sense.

Although the excitement and adventure of a world war and a devastating clash of technology keeps the story moving along, the author also delves deeply into the cultural shock between the \\"'temps\\" (contemporaries) and the time travelers. The personal and cultural reactions between the two groups are surprising and revealing. Old salts from the WWII navy have a hard time dealing with female naval officers, diverse ethnic groups in responsibility and authority and the \\"modern\\" social outlook of the misplaced servicemen and women. The culture shock also extends into the civilian population who can't believe the future produces such a mish mash of people. I truly enjoyed this book and look forward to the sequels.	2004-11-20

Once again Pendergast and D'Agosta are teamed up to solve what looks like crimes of the devil himself. It is a very fast moving book, with Pendergast looking like a super James Bond while D'Agosta provides the muscle and shoe leather. Some other interesting characters are introduced, one being a possible love interest for D'Agosta. I like the book and it has some very exciting and spooky moments. I was a little put off by the many references to the rather esoteric artists, music and Italian history. A little of that adds to a story, but an overabundance is boring. Otherwise, this is a great book meeting the expectations we have of the Preston/Childs writing team.	2004-10-19

This is a long book but very quickly read. There is action on the sea, air and land. It is truly one of those books that you can't stop reading. The story moves along quickly and there is plent of action, violence, adventure and some really nasty bad guys. The ending is something of a surprise, even though you expect the unexpected in this type of story. The main characters are quite interesting, and I would like to see a sequel involving Rick and Zeffi. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is that some of the attempts at humor in the book fell flat and seemed incongruous. Otherwise, a fantastic read. I put Mr. Stroud in the top three of thriller writers today.	2004-10-04

We are treated to the machinations of high level Washington politics, down and dirty intelligence activities and some hard core direct military action. This is one of the best action/thriller series around today, much better than some of the more famous established writers of the genre. Mitch Rapp is almost a 21st century James Bond, but without the cartoonish escapades of 007. Flynn touches on many issues germaine to the real world of terrorism and world politics.

I liked the fact that it takes place in a place other than LA or New York. The two main characters remind me of many of the &quot;buddy&quot; police movies that have come out over the past years. Kerley adds a touch of humor and sarcasm into the story, but also keeps the plot very frightning and the action moves along very well.

The premise is of course far-fetched, the characters one diminsional but the action is a roller coaster ride of thrills, hair raising adventure and unbelievable escapes from danger. It is first rate escapist fiction and taken as such, there is none better. It is a good way to escape from reality for a few hours and enjoy the fruit of the author's unbounded imagination.

Although this book is scary and compelling to read, I wasn't sure if it was a pure sci-fi/horror story or a spiritual message from the author. I think the book was way to short to really develop either story line and a lot of events were never fully explored or explained.<br />The author seemed to have a number of favorite words such as &quot;susurrant&quot; that he used quite often. He also seems to favor a lot of alliteration, sometimes a bit too much.<br />It is a good story though, and scary enough that the reader may want to limit the reading of it to the daylight hours. I found it to be one of those books that is subtly frightning without resorting to excessive or graphic violence and gore.	2004-06-21

You don't want to stop until the killer's identity is uncovered and hopefully he is caught. Intriguing characters, fast moving plot; I highly recommend it.	2004-05-31
US	52991018	RUKTE9K64YPQS	1552370518	890307130	The Big One	Books	4	1	1	N	N	great disaster story	This story deals, quite realistically, with the devastation following several major earthquakes in southern California. There is a handful of principle characters and we follow their plight throughout the book as each of them deals with their personal quest to survive. The book seems to be well researched and provides quite a bit of technical details about earthquakes, specfically in the southern California area.<br />It is scary to imagine a disaster such as this, and the inability of the emergency services to deal with the damage and provide aid to the survivors.<br />My only complaint is that the book should have had more careful editing. There were more than a few grammatical errors and some of the sentence structure was questionable. Otherwise, I highly recommend this story.	2004-05-24

It is a quick paced novel full of action and excitement. It deals with a topic of great importance to all Americans and the scenario is certianly scary and quite plausible.

His style is to integrate into the story a lot of background on the places, people and events in the book. In earlier books this exposition has been balanced and did not distract from the plot. However &quot;Burnt Bones&quot; was more exposition than plot. The story could have been very frightning but the jumps from storyline to historical facts was not well planned and diminished the enjoyment of the story. I like Slade's style and most of the factual material is quite interesting, but when it completely overshadows the story it is annoying. I still am a fan and have his two latest books to read this summer. I hope more emphasis is placed on telling the scary stories he is famous for in these two.	2004-05-06

After reading it, you can see that all of the events could be in tomorrow's headlines. It is a great story that moves along quickly and is easy to read. The characters are not really well developed but this is a plot oriented story. It is quite scary and Mr. Collins seems to have a lot of factual knowledge to support this storyline. My only complaint is the romantic byline in the second half of the book. Although not much time was devoted to it, it is the one unbelievable event in the book. Otherwise I highly recommend it. It is a story that will scare you and keep you reading late into the night.	2004-04-23

Missing are Charlie Parker and his cronies, although the Parker character appears briefly a couple of times in the story. Also, as in the previous novels, the plot is fast, violent and intriguing. The bad guys are really bad and a lot of people end up dead. There is a bit of a supernatural undercurrent to the story that is a bit ambiguous at times, but it adds to the mysteriousness of the plot. There really is no central &quot;good guy&quot; character here, just a group of people caught up in violent circumstances. I highly recommend this novel.	2004-04-09

At times there is a good deal of exposition providing background or explanations of what is happening in the novel. In other books the author has provided somewhat more than is needed and has indeed bogged down the story with very great detail of procedures used in the plot. &quot;Dogs of War&quot; comes to mind because there was enough details about illegal gun running to be boring and distract from the plot. However the &quot;Avenger&quot; was well balanced, with some very interesting facts(?) provided about the CIA, FBI, counterterroism, Vietnam and the Bosnian war.<br />It is a fast moving story and a quick read. The protaganist is nearly believable, but not as outlandish as some action heros. It is worth reading just for some of the author's insights. I recommend this book to any fan of Frederick Forsyth or who likes an exciting action/adventure story.	2004-02-02

The plot is rather bland. One rescue attempt gone bad results in a group of scientists trying to survive an unforgiving trek across an antartic glacier during the long winter while being pursued by a slightly crazy egomaniac. The hardships encountered while trying to survive with less than minimal supplies are described in detail. I had a chill just reading about the dangers of the antartic cold. Overall it is an average story, but provides a scary insight into a continent most people know little about.	2004-01-23

The first three in this series were great, with plot lines that grab you from the first page and keep you reading well into the night. This one just doesn't have the same level of excitement, although it is a good read for Parker fans. It seemed a bit confusing at times and delved into the metaphysical a bit too much. Parker's two comrades in arms, Angel and Louis, were not as much a part of the action as in the previous novels. The author seemed to be sending a message instead of the mile a minute action we are accustomed to in the Parker series. I hope the next story gets back to the same style as the first three.	2004-01-02

It is refreshing to read a story set in the midwest where things are a little more laid back than in the big cities.  Mr. Harstad has created several interesting characters and continues to develop them in each story.  I especially like the fact that the male and female officers can work together in these stories without having a romantic attraction. It is just about cops doing their job and in Nation county they do it well.	2003-11-29

I would have like to have seen more about the police procedurals and the detective work done to catch these guys.

Author Blunt has created a believalbe, worldly set of characters who are able to keep the action going while dealing with their own personal problems.  Although this is one of those stories that grab you at the beginning and keep you reading through the night, it is not a mindless escapade in non-stop thrills, but just a very good story about detectives searching for the truth and their lives outside of the station house. I especially like the setting. The small, rural town locale in Canada seems to add to the suspense.  It is a welcome diversion to read about someplace other than the huge metropolitan US cities where most novels seem to take place.  Cardinal and Delorme are interesting, entertaining characters who complement each other perfectly. I can't wait for the third novel in this series.	2003-07-26

He presents the facts, as horrible as they may be, in a readable format without any superflous narrative (in most cases). It was scary to learn about the dangers of smallpox, and how deadly this disease really is. He also brings to light the sometimes crazy workings of our governmental agencies who are supposed to protect us from this type of horror.  It seems though that they can never agree on the best course of action.  I have read all of Mr. Preston's books, and he always delivers.  My only objection to this particular book is the often overly descriptive narrative of the physical characteristics of the people involved in the story.  I don't think it is absolutely necessary to know a person's height, hair and eye color or the way they dress. I found this a bit distracting.  Otherwise, this is a book that every American should read.	2003-06-08

It is the type of story that keeps you reading, just to discover if the characters escape from their latest life threatning situation.  This is a somewhat technical book, with theories that seem plausible but a bit far out. The characters seemed a bit wooden and two dimensional but the action is non stop. And beware, you have to put your imagination into overdrive to believe that the characters could survive any of the circumstances they are thrown into.  For those who like the more outlandish techo-thrillers, this will fill the bill.	2003-06-08

A very taut, well written story, Shutter Island gets your attention from the first page and doesn't let up.  I was really surprised by the ending which was quite an unexpected turn of events. Enough said; knowing the ending will spoil this great story. I particularly like Mr. Lehane's style. It is very direct, void of superflous narrative and descriptive details. He tells just what needs to be told and no more.  Character development is excellent and the plot moves right along with no impediments.  I plan to enjoy more of this author's books.	2003-05-21

The author ties together several subplots to weave a very taut, exciting story.  There is plenty of action, good character development and a sense of intrigue that keeps you reading just to find out what happens next. This is one of the best police novels I have read in quite awhile.  Although somewhat violent, it all feeds the plot line quite well without being gratuitous.  I highly recommend this book.	2003-05-21

Parker and his cohorts confront another evil foe and manage to come out on top once again.  This is a great series and each book grabs you from page one and keeps you hooked until the finish.  Connolly continues to produce some of the most evil characters you will find anywhere. I just hope his imagination doesn't run dry.  Parker is something of a cross between Lew Archer, Philip Marlowe and Travis McGee. Unique in his own way he manages to get the job done with the help of his two rather odd friends, Louis and Angel.  These books have lots of action, great characters and a fast paced story line.  If you are a fan of this genre, you won't find anything better.	2003-05-10

This compilation continues the crazy antics of Roger, Bucky and Satchel. If you are an animal lover, you can't afford to miss these characters.  If you aren't, you will still be entertained and amused at the interactions among cat, dog and human. Being a cat owner for many years, I tend to favor the Bucky character since he typifies the antics of my cat (Scully). Although my cat doesn't talk or use my credit card (yet) there are many similarities between Bucky and regular felines. The attitude, the physical demeanorare very real.  Poor Satchel seems to be not so bright, but is a lovable character who seems provide stability to the household and keeps Bucky in check.  Roger seems to have infinite patience and keeps his cool amid the chaos the two non-humans create, stoically playing whipping boy for Satchel and Bucky.<br />I highly recommend this comic strip and especially the compilations that have been released (I believe this is the fourth).  Bucky and company will bring you many hours of smiles and chuckles that are gauranteed to relieve depression.	2003-04-08

I liked this novel until the last section which seemed to be contrived and out of character.  I won't reveal much since it could give away the ending, but I think this plot line spoiled an otherwise great story.  The book does grab the reader, typical of Hunter's writing and you have to keep reading to find out what happens next.  Early Swagger is a bigger than life hero, but an honorable and noble character.  This is a good story, well worth reading, but be warned that it does have considerable graphic violence.	2003-03-29

True, they are not of exceptionable literary merit, but the stories are intriguing and the characters add a lot to the story.  I think they offer insight to life in the midwest, and a lot of detail about police work in that area.  &quot;Code 61&quot; is a quick read with a rather unusual bad guy who could have really been expanded more in the story. He is discussed a lot peripherally, but not enough is said about his motive or background. Without revealing anything about the plot, I am a little confused about the title since it doesn't really tie in with the story all that well. I would also like to see the Hester Gorse character expanded. She is the tough, no nonsense state agent who assists Deputy Houseman in most of his cases.  In any event, it is a good story and worth a read.  I would caution readers that if you are not into &quot;police procedural&quot; novels, then this may not be for you.	2003-03-06

Mr. Littell is one of the best writers of the genre and I have never been dissappointed by any of his books.  This is a lengthy story, but one that is hard to put down. The characters are very real and present a side of the spy business that we never see in movies or television.  I particularly like the depiction of James Angleton. I read a biography of this man many years ago, and found his character in &quot;The Company&quot; to be true to life. The plot covers a lot of ground, from Berlin in the aftermath of WWII, to the Russian conflict in Afghanistan, with a detailed treatment of the bay of pigs disaster.  The story grabs you, however, and moves along well. Once you finish it, you will wish that it had lasted even longer.<br />If you are a fan of spy stories or want to know more about the workings of the CIA, then this is a book you need to read.	2003-02-20

It had the makings of a great techo/scientific thriller about a legendary society. It was able to deliver on some of my expectations, but there was far too much material about ancient languages, cultures and civilization.  This may be interesting to people who specialize in those fields, but most of it was too arcane for me to begin to understand, and there was far more detail on the subjects than needed for a fiction novel.  Some exposition is necessary in any novel to help set the plot and characterzations, but this was way too much.  This is a fair story that could have been much better.	2003-01-14

The two book collections of the strip released so far have provided immense enjoyment for me.  Being a cat owner, I can relate to the situations and \\"attitude\\" of Bucky, the feline member of this little family group. Most of the predicaments are typical of cat behavior I have seen from two cats. If mine could talk, they would certainly express many of Bucky's views I'm sure.	2002-06-25

I have been a big fan since &quot;Sharkey's Machine&quot; was published.  &quot;Eureka&quot; does not dissapoint.  It is an intriguing story with well developed characters and a feel of nostalgia for more simple times.  With the story taking place in the first half of the twentieth century, the author does not have to bog down the story with a plethora of technical details. It is one of the few books I have read in quite awhile that was truly impossible to put down.  It seemed easy to get caught up in the plot and the characters' lives.  This novel is not as violent as some of his earlier works, but still has enough action to keep the reader interested.  To me it was a good story and an enjoyable read.  I hope to see more books more often from this author.	2002-06-11

This is pure escapism action with a fairly plausible plot line.  Briggs Tanner is a great protaginist although he seems almost super human sometimes and is able to escape from impossible situations.  This story is similar to those of Clancy and others, but with less technical detail and more focus on plot and characters.  The only fault I can find is with the editing. There were quite a few typographical errors that should have been caught.  I have seen similar errors in other books from this publisher.<br />I hope Mr. Blackwood brings back this cast of characters in future novels.	2002-06-03

There is little thought to plot credibility or much emphasis on characterzation.  With that mindset, one has to give the author credit for producing a wild technothriller.  Agreed that most of the events are completely unbelievable and the characters are mostly caricatures of the &quot;rambo type&quot; action hero, it is still a good, quickly read, entertaining book for those who like this type of story. If you are seeking intellectual gratification, this is not the book for you. If you like mindless adventure, constant action and indestructible good guys, then you will enjoy this book.	2002-05-14

This title introduces the jaded cop, Jack Paris.  His pursuit of a pair of vicious serial killers makes for exciting reading.  This is not a book for the faint hearted, since there are graphic descriptions of the murders and the sexual tone of the story is quite explicit. The characters are well developed and believable, with Jack Paris portrayed as a middle-age cop with a lot of baggage. There is also a plot line that is left unresolved that stretches the credibly of the story.  Otherwise, if you like a tense, exciting, hard-to-put down murder/cop novel, this one is for you.	2002-05-14

In this story, we meet another evil psycho who not only likes to kill his victims, but mutilate them as well.  Pursuing this monster is the jaded cop, Jack Paris.  This is an engrossing tale, with a down to earth hero who has his own share of problems in addition to tracking down an elusive, vicious murderer. The story is frightening and graphically violent, so if you are the least bit squeamish, think twice about reading the book. Interesting characters, fast moving plot and a monstrous villian make for a quick, tension filled read.<br />This is the first book I've read by Mr. Montanari. I plan to read the others to find out what I have been missing.	2002-04-22

This is one of Mr. Rollins' best books so far, reminiscent of the non-stop action in his first book, \\"Subterranean\\". It is far better than \\"Deep Fathom\\" with more hair raising situations and unbelievable escapes.  Characterzation takes a back seat to plot development and action sequences, but taken just as a thrilling adventure it is suberb. Mr. Rollins' style reminds me a lot of the writing of Alister McLean, another author who could spin a great, albeit sometimes unbelievable yarn.<br />Not being an expert on the Amazon rain forest, I cannot attest to the validity of the flora and fauna theories described in the book, but whether factual or not they contribute greatly to the mood of the story.  My only complaints are that the ending seems a bit contrived and some of the characters were unnecessarly killed off. It is violent, but not as graphic as lot of novels with similar story lines. And there is of course the requisite romantic interests, although it does not play a significant role in the story line. All in all a great read. I look forward to Mr. Rollins' next book.	2002-04-08

Good dialogue, believable characters and a plot that grabs the reader make for a great read. The locale of the story appealed to me. It was a welcome change of pace to see a small, fictional town in Canada used for the setting instead of the typical big american city.  The intimacy of a small town added to the horror of a serial killer on the loose.  I hope to see more stories with detective Cardinal and his partner Lise.	2002-03-26

If you haven't read the first book, this one will not make much sense.  I find the plot of this &quot;series&quot; interesting and exciting, and most of the characters well developed.  However I was hoping that &quot;Outer Perimeter would advance the plot more than it did. About half of the book was a retelling of events in the first installment. Mr. Goddard is an excellent writer and has provided many great thriller stories.  This plot line has great potential. I hope the next installment, if there is one, will advance the plot and provide closure to some of the plot lines.	2002-03-04

The villian in this book is an especially bad guy and the reader is never quite sure how things will turn out for the &quot;good&quot; guys. The hero is not all that admirable, but he does get the job done, even showing some remorse for the tactics he is forced to use.<br />This is a good book that any Perry fan will enjoy.	2002-01-29

However the remainder of the book seemed bog down with narrative dealing with the central character's emotional problems.  I also found too much emphasis on the &quot;machismo&quot; of the HRT members. The story concept was sound, but it was about 100 pages too long.  The ending was too predictable and abrupt.  I think the conspiracy aspect of the plot could have been better developed.	2002-01-08

It did fulfill that promise to some degree but the ending was so vague that I was sorry I wasted the time reading the book.  The author never really defines the &quot;evil force&quot; destroying the country.  It is a mediocre book that could have been much better.	2001-12-04

It contains information on every aspect of buying, adopting, raising and caring for our feline friends.  It has very thorough descriptions of the the different purebred cats and a history of the beginnings of each breed.

I found that the plot moved slowly in places, there was too much technical detail and the action really doesn't get started until the last third of the book.  It is difficult to believe that a team of SEALS would go on a mission so ill prepared.  The story also had threads of the &quot;Aliens&quot; plot woven into it; tough female character left to face an almost indestructable mutant monster after all of her companions are killed or incapacitated.<br />Overall I enjoyed the story, but it could have been much better.	2001-10-25
US	52991018	R2554VB2WTNULR	0743203321	229095796	Dark Hollow	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A frightening story	This second outing by John Connolly is a compelling story, and an appropriate follow up to his first book, &quot;Every Dead Thing&quot;. It is a continuation of the same principle characters, off on another trail of revenge. Bird reminds me of the Andrew Vachss' character, Burke, who wavers from one side of the law to the other. Certainly neither is perfect, nor are they the ideal &quot;hero&quot;. Angel and Louis are certainly a unique pair; not very nice, but likeable for their loyalty.<br />I found this story to be one of the scariest I have read in a while. It is violent, so if shooting and killing bother you, I would not recommend this book. Plots and subplots abound, keeping the reader intrigued and guessing to very end. I especially enjoyed the rural Maine setting. It added to the suspense and overall mood of the book. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy a scary, action packed tale. I hope we see more from Mr. Connolly in the future.	2001-09-24

The best story I have read is &quot;Field of Blood&quot; by Gerald Seymour.  However &quot;Prya for Us Sinners&quot; is a realistic protrayal of the devious ways all parties to the conflict operate.

The first was &quot;Subterranean&quot; which I thought was much better.  &quot;Deep Fathom&quot; was interesting, but seemed to drag in places.  It had an &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; feel to it since the characters could get out of any situation unharmed. Mr. Rollins seems to knowledgeable about his subject matter and the descriptions of the scientific phenomenon that appear in the story are interesting. It is difficult to pin down, but for some reason this story just did not move along as well as did &quot;Subterranean&quot;. I have not yet read &quot;Excavation&quot; but plan to soon.	2001-08-15

Needless to say, I anxiously awaited the sequel to see what mischief the characters left alive got themselves into. It was almost a given that Pete and Ward would be involved somehow in some serious action.  I was not disappointed with the path the characters took in &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot;. Once I became accustomed to the writing style, I was fascinated by the blending of fact and fiction in what is a very plausible explanation of the major traumatic events of the sixties. I really hated to see the book end. Even though the principle characters are not people you invite to your Christmas party, they are nevertheless memorable, and to some degree in their lifestyle, honorable.  Although ruthless and deadly, I found Pete, Ward and Wayne somewhat likeable, especially compared to the supposed &quot;honorable&quot; characters. Ellroy is a great writer, and the &quot;Tabloid&quot; and &quot;Six Thousand&quot; duo is a superb portrayal of the darker side of life in the USA in the 50s and 60s.  I wish I could look forward to yet another sequel, but I think the ending in &quot;Six Thousand&quot; wraps things up nicely.  I can only hope that Mr. Ellroy has more great stories he will share with us.	2001-07-03

However I thought there were too many Indiana Jones type moments in the book.  No matter what situation the characters found themselves in,  you always knew they would escape virtually unharmed. Some of the  situations seemed contrived just to fill out the book. The ending seemed  somewhat abrupt, with no explanation for what happened to a certain  character.  Overall, a good book but not up to the usual Crichton  thriller.	2000-01-03

I enjoy  Mr. Harstad's writing immensely.  His prose is to the point and moves along  quite well.

This book started with the promise of being a top notch sci-fi thriller but fizzled about half-way through.  The  majority of the story takes place at a single location, the remote cabin.  Once the &quot;secret&quot; is revealed to the reader, the author leaps to  concluding the book.  It would have been much better if the plot had more  substance.  Too much time was spent explaining the details of forensic  evidence collection at the expense of developing the main story, namely the  strange visitors we learn about near the end of the book.<br />I could see a  lot of potential for a great story, but the author seemed to chose to end  the book rather abruptly, leaving lots of unanswered questions.	1999-07-09

However it just did not maintain that kind of intensity.  There was too much detail paid to  Lector's likes/dislikes. The continuity of the story was difficult to  follow at times.  No one reading a thriller could be that interested in  Italian history.<br />On the plus side, it was horrifying in places,  reminiscient of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Red  Dragon&quot;. But it does not compare to Mr. Harris's two previous works.  Perhaps another &quot;sequel&quot; is in the works to atone for the ending  of &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

This is a novel that brought back memories of a near military disaster that a lot of americans have probably forgotten about.  The details in the book made the battle all too real, and the reactions of the soldiers  involved showed how individuals can be mortally afraid and still perform  their duties with courage and valor.

The majority of the story was a description of the trials and tribulations of a high flying sports agent and his insufferable clients and employees.  It seemed that all at once the  author decided that there was a murder to solve and only one chapter left  to do it.  It read more like an expose than a fiction novel.	1999-01-14

I  was glad to see the loose ends in &quot;Headhunter&quot; brought to  conclusion.  This is an interesting series of stories that is exciting and  engrossing.

It is very realistic and presents a variety of characters, some of which you might encounter in any big city.  I look forward to Mr. Anderson's next book.	1998-01-29
