I loved the Nest article on the cells. I bought Nest for our guests in Chateau-Bois-Briand because of its sophistication and originality. Most of our guests are &quot;road-warriors&quot; and &quot;trouble-shooters&quot; who enjoy reading this kind of books, sipping a Cognac next to the fire-place in a 600-years old castle.<br />Viewpoints and pictures are so unusual that you never get bored. Nest is a reference. This is why I would advise to buy it, either as a magazine or as a book like this one. You will never throw it away.	2004-07-03

This high place for painting history (Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec) can be seen in a very impressive way thanks to the authors of this book. Same for &quot;Les ar&egrave;nes de Lut&egrave;ce&quot;, the roman circus located in the middle of Latin District. Nobody ever see this most ancien monument of Paris unless you enter the place ... or you buy this book.  Another good reason to buy this book: some pictures are displayed close to similar aerial views taken 70 years ago! This is especially impressive for Les Halles. For those of us who remember this &quot;coeur de Paris&quot; will feel something when they will see Les Halles &quot;before&quot;, &quot;during the demolition process&quot; and &quot;after&quot;.  One cannot say this book is &quot;artistic&quot;. Neither the layout nor the pictures themselves have the quality of Artus-Bertrand.  Despite this limitation to my enthusiasm I recommand buying this book either as a gift or as a souvenir from a Paris you never see.	2000-11-01

It belongs to a tradition in French  publishing business: collection of essays written by famous writers about a  specific place.

One became famous in the 70's when the French discovered they could avoid spoiling Provence landscapes and sea-shore by building marinas instead of leaving anyone build his own  house. This reference to Le Corbusier theory on public space is quite  appropriate at Port-Grimaud, a few miles away from &quot;La Cit&eacute;  Radieuse&quot; from Le Corbusier in Marseilles. When I discovered Port  Libert&eacute; some years ago it was not finished. It already had this flavour of  adventure that made Spoerry previous work attractive. Spoerry is not only  an architect. He also patented electric cars that strangely look quite  similar to Smart vehicles... This book tells you a lot about the genesis of  Spoerry works. You will like it.	2000-06-18

It's a divine pleasure you can experiment  buying a recent bottle from the cooperative shop inside Yquem village.  Price will start around 150 dollars a bottle.

Thanks to this book we believe that we belong to a group of unknown  individuals who fight every day to keep and enhance traditions of good  building and happy living. When will we create a Club? Britanny Ferries, a  French company, dedicated to passengers and trucks transportation between  England, Ireland, Spain and France invented once a Club for English new  owners of houses in France. These guys cross the Channel every month (some  of them do it every week-end) to fix the roof or paint the windows. If you  know one of these lovely people, ask them.

Elton John is an aristocrat, not only because the Queen said so. He demonstrates this in every day life, in the way he admits his weaknesses, in his involvement for beautiful causes. His house on French Riviera is a  jewell. It's almost &quot;too much&quot;. But &quot;too much&quot; is never  enough for Elton. Thanks to the great pictures from this book you will  discover a yellow castle between blue sky, deep blue sea and green grass.  White structure of the house creates a contrast with blue, green and  yellow. These colours could have been chosen by David Hockney. Original  style of this house was respected. Flowers are every where. Furniture is on  line with the overall &quot;villegiature&quot; style. Don't dream &quot;too  much&quot;, this &quot;Saint-Jean Cap-Ferrat&quot; life-style has a price.  But who talked about money, here? Not Elton, for sure. This is, again, a  demonstration of the noble qualities of that man. Never in the whole book,  you will find any decoration detail that could make you think it is here to  impress people or to demonstrate power. What a paradox! this modern  excentric, in the tradition on XVIIIth century english excentricity, never  looks arrogant. None of his crazy demonstrations of &quot;luxe&quot; make  you feel bad. The Atlanta house is more interesting because of the  beautiful furniture and made to order closets for collections of ...  everything.  This book is a tribute to pleasure, good taste (yes!) and  high-life. I learned this word from Johnny Weissmuller in Acapulco (pie de  la cuesta beach), just before he died. I think it is quite appropriate to  describe what these houses are made for.	2000-05-17

Nashville is the town where french decorator Am&eacute;lie de Gaulle decided to settle down with her family. She brought for clients, friends and herself many books from her masters in decoration, including her former boss, Sir  Terence Conran. This is where we discovered the picture of our country  house's gate in Bourbonnais! With this comment: &quot;The French are  maniacs about security. They even build such gates to protect their  intimacy&quot;. When Meaulne village blacksmith built the gate described by  Sir Terence Conran he did not think his work would be famous in Nashville  (and everywhere in the world thanks to Sir Conran ... and Amazon.com). Just  to tell you that even if your country house is not in France you might be  surprised by many pictures from this book. Sir Terence Conran is the master  of good taste in London and in Provence. If you plan a trip to France, buy  this book first. Your projects might never be the same. You might change  your mind and prefer to walk or bike through tiny villages instead of  driving tthrough the standards of Paris by night and other old fashioned  ways of travelling. You might want to adopt a new life-style. You might  want to get inspiration from real France with Conran as a guide.

Did you know that Turner invented many details that make its landscapes so impressive and picturesque? Let's take Nantes cathedral, for instance, when you look at the way Turner painted it you wander if it is the cathedral you  go to every sunday morning. In fact, during the splendid exhibition of this  Loire Valley sketches and paintings in Nantes in 1998, we discovered that a  painter had no obligation to tell the true story about your home town...  This book is full of sketches (Turner made a lot of them on the spot, then  painted some of them when he was back in England). You will appreciate the  exquisite colours palette and, if you plan to visit Loire Valley, you will  bring this book with you.	2000-03-13

They still are (for how much time?)useful for people who cannot spend too much time in Bourgogne or Jura. Michelin Green  Guide is still valuable. Especially when you visit Burgundy and Jura. Both  famous areas for gourmets from all over the world. Because Michelin forged  its reputation on restaurants, it is wise to use both Michelin Red Guide  2000 Edition for France and the local green guide for Burgundy and Jura.  Those who plan a visit to Switzerland should also buy it. Jura is the other  side of the Leman Lake. By the way, some of the most beautiful Alpes and  Mont-Blanc landscapes can be viewed from the Jura slopes above Geneva.  Because they are concise; because they have explicit propositions Michelin  are always to recommend to the one-day or two-days visitor.	2000-03-12

Knopf is Gallimard correspondant in USA. Gallimard published various guides-books in french about Loire Valley. This area is so much filled with castles and magnificient landscapes that one book was  not enough. Knopf US edition for this digest is quite a good choice for  those who want to get more than the plain Michelin Green Guide. Castles  drawings are just extraordinary. They built Gallimard reputation for  guide-books. Don't forget to buy Arthur Frommer's, Lonely Planet or  Michelin Red Guide if you don't know yet where to stay. Knopf guide to the  Loire Valley will not be very useful in that matter.	2000-03-12

Valence, Nîmes, Gap, Monte-Carlo. These are the limits of the game. And what a game! With this very precise map, you can spend years and years exploring what most french people call &quot;the most beautiful part of  France&quot;. Michelin staff was smart enough to put together on the same  handy map both &quot;arri&egrave;re-pays of Provence&quot; and more widely known  Côte-d'Azur. If you like walking from one hotel to the other one you will  find this map detailed enough to provide you with the trails details. If  you are just a business man in a hurry, you will pay attention to detailed  access to the newest expressways. TGV (high speed) train can be tracked  through Provence countryside (maybe a useful thing to do if you plan to buy  a quiet hideaway in silent unknown village)... Whatever character you will  be playing, you will need this Swiss Knife tool: a Michelin 1/200 000 map.	2000-03-12

They did it with hotels, bed &amp;  breakfast, villages. You can find their guides in each european country.  The French B&amp;B guide-book is especially good. Some of our friends,  featured in this book, consider it as the equivalent of Michelin for  restaurants.	2000-03-06

Filled with accurate details, Michelin Red Guide is the equivalent for Rolls-Royce cars. You can hardly hear the noise of the engine. Everything is smooth, yet precise, secure, beautiful. You know you can build a  journey's success on such a partner. Some people under 40 will find this  book old fashioned. Others will thank Michelin to keep traditions alive.

While others (we will not detail names here)came down to 1  star. In Nantes, chateau de Bois-Briand, Loire-Valley, our hosts appreciate  classic food and traditions, as almost everywhere in France. This is why we  will invest, this year again, in Michelin Guide Rouge. Do like us, keep  your old versions of Guide Rouge. They will sell well in Amazon Actions!	2000-03-06

Because France does not change that much, Michelin Green Guides do not change either. They still keep this handy pocket format that all other publishers copied. They still are very shy with pictures. They don't tell  you everything you would expect from a french guide-book. Still, they tell  you what is most important. You cannot make any mistake if you follow their  advice. So bring this guide-book with you ... and buy the Eyewitness guide  to get a more detailed view of our nice region.	2000-03-06
