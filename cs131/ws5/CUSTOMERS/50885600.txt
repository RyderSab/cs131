I recently completed \\"The Path to Power,\\" the first volume of Robert A. Caro's multi-volume biography about Lyndon Baines Johnson, the thirty-sixth President of the United States. Here is a magnificently written, highly detailed, and ultimately scathing portrait of the early life of the man who brought us the \\"Great Society,\\" the \\"War on Poverty,\\" and the Civil Rights Act of 1964... as well as the \\"Credibility Gap\\" and the War in Vietnam.<br /><br />Robert A. Caro's majestic  Johnsonian triptych  \\"The Years of Lyndon Johnson.\\" is currently made up of  \\"The Path to Power,\\" which covers LBJ's life from his birth in 1908 until his first run for the U.S. Senate in 1941; \\"Means of Ascent,\\" a chronicle of Johnson's years from 1941 to his second (and ultimately successful) Senate run in 1948; and \\"Master of the Senate,\\" the critically acclaimed narrative of LBJ's 12-year career in the Senate (1948-1960). These three volumes are among the most critically acclaimed and highly honored biographies of all time.  They've won three National Book Awards (one for each volume); a Francis Parkman Prize for best work of history (Volume 3); and a Pulitzer Prize for biography (also Volume 3.)<br /><br />As I've already stated, \\"The Path to Power\\" covers Johnson's early life, from his birth in 1908 to an impoverished Texas Hill Country politician and his dreamy wife; through his upbringing, college education, early political career, and early years in the U.S. House of Representatives as a \\"complete Roosevelt man;\\" to his unsuccessful first run for the U.S. Senate in 1941.<br /><br />Of the many premises in the first volume of Caro's triptych, two stand out as paramount:  First, according to Caro, is that LBJ secretly harbors a burning ambition to become President of the United States, a craving for political power that apparently manifests itself in his teens, and from which he never wavers until he attains that high office.  Caro's second premise is that  LBJ is the antithesis of his highly principled, idealistic father, Sam Ealy Johnson. The elder Johnson is a superb politician, but also incapable of bringing prosperity to his family. As young Lyndon watches his father fail at nearly everything he does, he concludes that his father's high principles, tenacious dedication to the truth,  and Populist idealism, lead to nothing but failure.  Better to lie, say anything at all, in fact, to get what you want, if that's what it takes to be successful.<br /><br />As a young adult, LBJ is thoroughly inculcated with those personality traits he thinks essential for success: a loud, vulgar, and abrasive manner; a calculating deceitfulness so pronounced he is derisively called \\"Bull\\" Johnson to his face by his peers; and a well developed ability to sycophantically curry favor from anyone he deems useful.<br /><br />After college, it isn't long before opportunity knocks on LBJ's door, in the form of a job as secretary to the newly elected Representative from Johnson's Congressional district.  He turns the novice congressman's office into a model of efficiency, all the while displaying a mammoth capacity for hard work.  After a few years as the congressman's  secretary, LBJ is appointed head of the National Youth Administration (NYA), one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) New Deal bureaucracies.  Johnson is the youngest of 48 state directors, and by all accounts, the most successful.  His zeal, hard work, and efficiency deeply impress FDR.  He soon becomes a favorite at the White House.<br /><br />In 1937, Congressman James Buchanan of Texas' Tenth District, dies.  He is a very senior and influential congressman who has the backing of several Texas contractors, including Herman and George Brown.  At his death, Buchanan leaves a host of political and patronage \\"loose ends,\\" including contracts for a new dam that's coveted by the Brown brothers.  The Browns are convinced that LBJ is the man who can get the Federal government to award them the dam contracts.  They convince him to run for Buchanan;s vacated seat, and they provide most of his financial backing.  After a closely contested special election, in which LBJ once again demonstrates his now legendary capacity for hard work, he is  improbably elected to the House over nine other candidates.  He will remain a Congressman for eleven years.<br /><br />In 1934, Johnson meets Claudia Alta \\"Lady Bird\\" Taylor, and, after a whirlwind courtship, marries her.  From the very beginning, LBJ proves himself a despicable, almost abusive spouse.  He peremptorily orders Lady Bird around in public. He cheats on her with a succession of women. He ignores her at parties.  Yet, this painfully shy, plain, woman remains staunchly loving and loyal to her man.<br /><br />Caro's portrait of LBJ the Congressman is decidedly negative.  LBJ does much work on his constituents' behalf at first - bringing major construction projects to his district (almost all of them going to the Brown brothers and electric power to the Texas hill country.  But he rarely, if ever, writes or sponsors legislation or makes speeches in the House.  Still, he remains very popular among a grateful constituency.<br /><br />In 1941, after four years in the House of Representatives, LBJ takes another step along the path to ultimate power: he decides to run in the special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the recently deceased  Morris Sheppard.  Johnson is barely known outside his own Congressional district. In the end, it comes down to a three-man race.  LBJ loses by just over 1,300 votes in an election that is almost assuredly stolen from him.  It's a lesson that LBJ will remember for the future...<br /><br />Robert Caro, a journalist who is a virtuoso of research, and a master craftsman with the old typewriter he uses when writing, has painted a portrait of young Lyndon Baines Johnson that is rich, textured, filled with intricate detail, and scathing in its judgments.  The pace of the tightly woven narrative never once flags.  The prose is elegant, slightly ironic in tone, and written with an historian's eye for detail and a journalist's flair for the dramatic.  I found the book  so entertaining that it was nearly impossible to put down... the kind of book I found myself thinking about when I wasn't reading it, and anxiously awaiting the time when I could get back to it.<br /><br />Now... on to the next volume of \\"The Years of Lyndon Johnson.\\"cts.

Journey with me now through one of the darkest, most suspenseful, most thrilling fictional murder mysteries I've ever read...<br /><br />\\"The Alienist,\\"  by Caleb Carr, is one of the best murder mysteries to appear on bookstore shelves in a very, very long time.  Between the covers of this 600-page novel is found a fast-paced and completely captivating story that will keep readers firmly positioned on the edge of  their seat.<br /><br />The novel is set in New York City in 1896.  \\"The Alienist\\" is Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychiatrist whose theories on the relationship between mental illness and criminal behavior have generated much controversy.  (Back in the late nineteenth century, persons who suffered from mental illness were considered \\"alienated\\" from society, and  experts who studied mental pathologies were known as \\"alienists.\\")  Kreizler's decades-long studies have led him to advocate modern forensic and psychological profiling techniques as the means of solving crimes in New York.  His ideas have, however, been met with stiff resistance from within the city's corrupt and hide-bound police department.<br /><br />Suddenly, the city is faced with something it's never seen before: a serial killer is on the loose.  The  victims of this particular murderer are young boys - all of them children of parents who are recent immigrants to the United States, and all of them engaged in  prostitution.  Within a matter of weeks, six boys have been mercilessly slaughtered by a bloodthirsty monster on the loose in New York...<br /><br />The police want nothing to do with solving these crimes.  The victims are all poor; they ply their trade on behalf of some of the city's most notorious underworld figures, men who pay the police for protection.  The New York Police Department (NYPD), at that time a hotbed of graft and corruption, is comprised mostly of men who are poorly trained and have absolutely no incentive to do their jobs. Fortunately, this is the time when Theodore Roosevelt (future President of the United States) was serving as President of New York City's Police Commission.  Roosevelt wants this case solved.<br /><br />Enter Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, who offers his services to Roosevelt as a means of solving the murders.  Kreizler wants to employ the forensic and profiling techniques that he's so long advocated.  Roosevelt agrees, but wants Kreizler to work in secret so as not to offend the Police Department or the city's political bosses.<br /><br />Kreizler assembles a team of what can only be described as misfits to assist him in his efforts. The members of his team include an alcoholic,  discredited reporter for the New York Times; a Police Department secretary  who has ambitions to become the very first woman police officer in NYPD's history; and  two brothers who are NYPD police detectives, ostracized for their ethnic background and their advocacy of modern forensic techniques in crime solving.<br /><br />What follows is a completely engrossing, lightning-paced, thrill-a-minute story as Kreizler and his team gather evidence from the crime scenes, analyze that evidence, and begin formulating a picture of the serial killer.  It soon becomes evident that the man (or woman) they're looking for is deeply disturbed; highly intelligent; and, as it turns out, watching them as they go about their work...<br /><br />Read this magnificently crafted novel to find out whether or not Kreizler and his colleagues are successful in hunting down New York City's first serial killer.  How do they overcome the nefarious attempts to stop their investigation?  What trials and tragedies  must our team endure as they seek to solve this case?  \\"The Alienist\\" reveals all!!<br /><br />\\"The Alienist\\" is a taut, gripping, suspense-filled murder mystery/thriller guaranteed to keep you turning pages far into the night in anticipation of what happens next.

I had never heard of Conrad Black, so I immediately questioned his credentials as a Presidential historian.  My Internet search revealed him to be none other than Lord Black of Crossharbour, a Canadian-born multi-billionaire media mogul and proponent of conservative political causes both in Canada and his adopted homeland, Great Britain.  And, oh yes, by the way... degrees in history and law from some of Canada's most prestigious universities. Obviously, eminently qualified to write a scholarly biography of the 32nd President of the United States...<br /><br />The proof, they say, is in the pudding, so I settled back and began reading \\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom\\" -- with, I must admit, a certain amount of skepticism.  It didn't take me long to realize that this is a winner of a book in many ways.  It's extremely well written; shows obvious, painstakingly detailed, and rigorous scholarly research; is eminently fair and balanced toward its subject; it successfully draws the historical era in which FDR lived into the story of his life; and it provides well argued, sharply reasoned historical analyses all along the way.<br /><br />Black narrates the now familiar story of FDR's life with an obvious affection for his subject, all the while providing a tremendous amount of detail.  Black's portrait shows FDR as a supercilious, facile young man who stretches the truth often to the breaking point; a courageous quadriplegic, struck down by poliomyelitis at age 39, just as he was about to step onto the national political scene, but undaunted by his affliction; a reforming governor of New York (1928-1932); and the 32nd President of the United States (1933-1945), by Black's standards one of the three greatest Chief Executives in American history (the others being Lincoln and Washington), and \\"the most important person of the twentieth century.\\"<br /><br />\\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom\\" is a huge volume; despite its heft, however, it remains immensely readable.  It lacks the last ounce of stylistic polish found in the books written by \\"professional\\" FDR biographers James MacGregor Burns, Kenneth S. Davis, and Frank Freidel.  However, that's not to say \\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom\\" isn't well written; it most decidedly is.  Black's research is prodigious and his many sources are impeccable.  His prose is refreshing in its simplicity, and his historical judgments and analyses are both incisive and well argued.<br /><br />Black's book has clear advantages over other, older, more \\"scholarly\\" biographies. Black is younger, and therefore is not a child of the Great Depression.  He is not American, so he never experienced FDR's New Deal.  This allows him to be more objective in his approach than other, older biographers whose works are tinted by their Depression/New Deal experiences.<br /><br />Black, certainly no apologist for liberal political causes, could have interjected his own conservative political agenda into this work, thereby creating a scathing biography of one of the most liberal of all American Presidents.  Instead, he did his research, and arrived at the conclusion that FDR was, along with Lincoln and Washington, one of America's greatest Presidents.  That is a tribute to Black's integrity as an historian and biographer, and gives his work tremendous credibility.<br /><br />Despite its great length, \\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom\\" is an excellent read, and therefore highly recommendedd President of the United States (1933-1945), by Black's standards one of the three greatest Chief Executives in American history (the others being Lincoln and Washington), and \\"the most important person of the twentieth century.\\"<br /><br />\\"Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion Of Freedom\\" is a huge volume; despite its heft, however, it remains immensely readable.

(Updated August 13, 2013)	Another volume can now be added to my personal list of \\"the best of the best\\" of history and biography: \\"An Army at Dawn,\\" Rick Atkinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning account of the North African campaign during World War II.  This is indeed a very special book!  Employing scrupulous and detailed research, and presented in a lively and penetrating narrative style, Atkinson, formerly an Assistant Managing Editor with \\"The Washington Post,\\" has provided a thorough and penetrating examination of the Allied and Axis military campaigns in North Africa during 1942-43.<br /><br />From the outset, Atkinson pulls no punches in establishing the importance of the North African campaign to the overall Allied victory in World War II.  In the book's Prologue he writes:  \\"No twenty-first century reader can understand the ultimate triumph of the Allied powers in World War II in 1945 without a grasp of the large drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943.\\"<br /><br />As Atkinson points out, that \\"large drama\\" was certainly a time of tremendous testing for the Allies.  Operation TORCH, as the campaign to liberate North Africa from Nazi tyranny was called, began on November 8, 1942.  Allied forces (predominantly British and American) made landings at several locations along a several hundred mile length of North African coastline. Even as these landings were being made,  many critical difficulties reared their ugly heads.  French army and navy forces occupying Morocco and Algeria not only refused to cooperate with the Allies; they actually turned their guns on the Americans and British.  Acting under coercion from the Nazi government, which threatened to complete its conquest of France by taking control of Vichy France,  French forces in North Africa fought tenaciously against the Allies for the first three days of Operation TORCH.<br /><br />Other, even more difficult problems beset the Allies.  One of the great recurring themes of \\"An Army at Dawn\\" is the fundamental schism within the Allied ranks throughout the North African campaign.  The British, already at war with Germany and Italy for over two years, resented American General Dwight D. Eisenhower's appointment as commander-in-chief  of Allied forces.  Eisenhower was considered inept;  some of those judgments may have been justified.  He seemed to concentrate his efforts on solving American-British-French political rivalries and crises rather than on winning the war in North Africa... so much so, that at one point U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall cabled Ike to \\"Delegate your international problems to your subordinates and give your complete attention to the battle in Tunisia.\\"<br /><br />British and American forces were forced to struggle with internecine resentments and rivalries.  They struggled to learn how to fight against a determined foe and how to hate the enemy they faced.  By fighting and losing the battles they did in North Africa, British and American forces learned the fighting skills they ultimately used to take the war to its successful conclusion in 1945 the German homeland.  Although many of Atkinson's historical judgments seem harsh in light of the ultimate Allied victory, he certainly backs up his arguments with well researched facts.<br /><br />\\"An Army at Dawn\\" is a superb book in every respect.  It combines first-class research with a polished, invigorating, and authoritative writing style.  Highly deserving of the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for History, it  is truly an essential work for an understanding of how the Allies gained victory in World War II, and one of the finest books on military history to appear in recent years.<br /><br />\\"An Army at Dawn\\" is the first of three volumes of what Atkinson calls \\"The Liberation Trilogy.\\"  The second volume, \\"The Day of Battle,\\" tells the story of the war in Sicily and Italy during 1943 and 1944. It was published in 2007. The final volume of this outstanding trilogy, published in 2013, is \\"The Guns at Last Light,\\"which covers the war in western Europe from D-Day (June 6, 1944) to the final surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945. All three volumes are available in Kindle editions.which covers the war in western Europe from D-Day (June 6, 1944) to the final surrender of Germany on May 8, 1945.

Kennedy 1917-1963\\" because of its author's stature as a scrupulously fair and highly literate historian and biographer. Robert Dallek, a Professor of History at Boston University, is well known for his scholarly works, and especially for his two-volume biography of President Lyndon Johnson (entitled \\"Lone Star Rising\\" and \\"Flawed Giant.\\")  Because of Dallek's sterling reputation for objectivity, I figured that \\"An Unfinished Life\\" would be an excellent biography of JFK.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  Of the four JFK biographies I've read over the years (now including \\"An Unfinished Life\\"), Dallek's book stands head and shoulders above the others in terms of detail, scholarship, and objectivity.<br /><br />\\"An Unfinished Life\\" is an excellent and important new book about President John F. Kennedy.  It may, in fact, be THE essential one-volume biography of JFK for those readers who value objectivity as a key quality in works of history and biography.  It combines in one volume all the most pertinent facts about the life and political career of the 35th President of the United States, presented in a seamless and well-written, (although rather stylistically stuffy) narrative.  True to his reputation for fairness and objectivity, Robert Dallek scrupulously avoids attempting to create new controversies about JFK; at the same time, he doesn't shy away from making negative judgments about Kennedy's decisions and actions when he feels those judgments are warranted.<br /><br />The whole fabric of Dallek's book is based on sound research and upon well-known and documented facts.  There are, however, two vitally important threads that run through \\"An Unfinished Life\\", which are based on new research and previously undocumented facts:  his predilection for philandering, and serious chronic problems with his health.<br /><br />The first thread, according to Dallek, has its roots in Kennedy's overall view of women.  Even as an adolescent, Jack viewed women as objects to be used for his own gratification, much as his father did.  Dallek presents a powerful case that young Jack was certainly aware of his father's many dalliances.  Such behavior was actually encouraged among the wealthy families of the day, so it seemed perfectly normal.  While he was in college and in the Navy, Jack's letters to friends are filled with references to his sexual exploits.  Even after his marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier in 1953, Kennedy's dalliances continued... almost up to the day he died.<br /><br />Kennedy's sexual appetite was also linked to the second important thread in \\"An Unfinished Life\\": his chronic health problems.  From earliest childhood, Jack was chronically ill with a succession of extremely painful and life-threatening maladies that eluded doctors' attempts to diagnose and treat them.  He was constantly in and out of hospitals with chronic stomach, colon, and prostate ailments, and severe lower back pain.  He was treated with steroids that probably only made his back pain much worse.  As he got older, his physical sufferings increased;  in 1947, he was diagnosed with Addison's disease.  Kennedy's illnesses imbued him with a strong fatalistic streak and an attitude that he might as well enjoy life's pleasures now, for tomorrow he may die.<br /><br />As it became more apparent that he was on the road to the White House, Kennedy, his father, brother, and political advisors, all made a concerted effort to \\"cover up\\" JFK's ailments.  They successfully painted him as a robust picture of youthful good health, beset only occasionally by back pain brought on my an old war injury.  It was, in fact, a myth that lasted until well after Kennedy's death.<br /><br />Overall, \\"An Unfinished Life\\" presents a positive picture of JFK.  Dallek's overall judgment is that Kennedy was a successful President - perhaps even a near-\\"great\\" Chief Executive - because he was able to faithfully discharge the duties of his office during an especially difficult period in American history, despite having to contend with chronic health problems that would have defeated a lesser man.  In Dallek's view, President John F. Kennedy was neither a \\"saint\\" nor a \\"sinner,\\" but instead, was the \\"idealist without illusions\\" whose Presidency was marked by successes and failures in equal measure.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!g an especially difficult period in American history, despite having to contend with chronic health problems that would have defeated a lesser man.

It picks right up where \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" ended - with the assassination of TR's predecessor, William McKinley. It ends on March 4, 1909, when Roosevelt reluctantly surrendered the reins of power to his hand-picked successor, William Howard Taft.<br /><br />By today's standards (or at least the standards set by the political pundits in the media), a President's overall \\"greatness\\" seems to be guided by whether or not he was responsible for at least one major positive accomplishment during his term(s) of office, while at the same time avoiding any major blunders. If you apply these standards to Theodore Roosevelt as he is portrayed in \\"Theodore Rex,\\" he arguably ranks as one of the five greatest Presidents in our Nation's history. Not only was he responsible for \\"one\\" major accomplishment - he was responsible for many. As Morris points out, Theodore Roosevelt, more than any President before him, and maybe since, transformed the Presidency from an almost figurehead-like office into what it is today: the most prominent and powerful office in the world.<br /><br />In \\"Theodore Rex,\\" Edmund Morris abandons the highly controversial literary device he used when writing \\"Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan\\" (in which he placed himself as a fictional observer of events), and wisely returns to what he does best: writing Presidential biographies with his stylishly crisp, clear, and highly entertaining prose. Never once does he let the pace of his eloquent narrative in \\"Theodore Rex\\" flag. I found myself immediately \\"hooked\\" while reading this superb book's first few pages. TR's means of handling his assumption of the Presidency after the assassination of William McKinley is a dramatic story in itself, and it's deftly handled by Morris. Nearly all of the major events of TR's presidency are handled with equal skill.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Rex\\" is a highly detailed and polished narrative that places both TR and his presidency in a decidedly positive light. Roosevelt is portrayed as a highly principled man, almost puritanical in his values, and unwilling to compromise on most deeply felt issues. Morris allows TR's youthful vigor, optimism, progressivism, and hunger for approval to shine through on every page.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Rex\\" shouldn't be mistaken as an exercise in hagiography, though. It is, at its heart, a scholarly, judicious, and finely balanced biography. Throughout the book, Morris provides an incisive analysis of Roosevelt and what he accomplished during his seven years as President. Successes and failures, good judgments and misjudgments... all are presented in equal measure.<br /><br />Of all the Presidential biographies I've read in recent years, \\"Theodore Rex\\" is one of the best. This eagerly anticipated sequel to \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,\\" written twenty years after its Pulitzer Prize-winning predecessor, is certainly its equal in quality of writing, scholarship, and insightful historical analysis. Not only that, but it's a great read!it's deftly handled by Morris. Nearly all of the major events of TR's presidency are handled with equal skill.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Rex\\" is a highly detailed and polished narrative that places both TR and his presidency in a decidedly positive light. Roosevelt is portrayed as a highly principled man, almost puritanical in his values, and unwilling to compromise on most deeply felt issues. Morris allows TR's youthful vigor, optimism, progressivism, and hunger for approval to shine through on every page.<br /><br />\\"Theodore Rex\\" shouldn't be mistaken as an exercise in hagiography, though. It is, at its heart, a scholarly, judicious, and finely balanced biography. Throughout the book, Morris provides an incisive analysis of Roosevelt and what he accomplished during his seven years as President. Successes and failures, good judgments and misjudgments... all are presented in equal measure.<br /><br />Of all the Presidential biographies I've read in recent years, \\"Theodore Rex\\" is one of the best.

A few weeks ago, while looking to take a break from all the history and biography that I usually read,  I went online (to Amazon.com, of course!) in search of a novel.  I wanted something relatively new and of high quality... something a little different; perhaps something containing a bit of humor and  an examination of our human condition.<br /><br />It didn't take me long to find exactly what I was looking for: \\"Empire Falls,\\" a novel by Richard Russo.  Published in May 2001 and winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  And, as luck would have it, a novel about Maine by a resident Maine author!!<br /><br />Welcome to Empire Falls, a fictional small town in the fictional county of Dexter, in the real live state of Maine.  Empire Falls is very typical of the small mill towns nestled alongside  Maine's great rivers - the Kennebec, the Androscoggin, and the Penobscot.  At river's edge, there's a shirt factory and a textile mill, both long closed and boarded up.  Most of the small businesses along Empire Falls' main street are likewise abandoned; plywood has replaced plate glass in most of the storefront windows.<br /><br />Meet the people who live in Empire Falls:  Miles Roby,  the book's protagonist... he's a really nice guy... early forties... soon to be divorced from Janine.  He's the proprietor of the Empire Grill, a little \\"greasy spoon\\" that he runs on behalf of Mrs. C.B. Whiting, the owner.  He hopes to inherit the eatery when Mrs. Whiting dies...<br /><br />Janine, Miles' \\"almost ex-\\" is trying hard to dump Miles as fast as she can.  Even before the divorce is final, she's taken up with Walt Comeau, the \\"Silver Fox,\\" an obnoxious sixty-year old local \\"swinger\\" who owns the town's aerobics club.  Since she and Walt have become an \\"item,\\" Janine has dropped fifty or so pounds, rediscovered her libido, (something she thinks Miles has lost permanently), and is addicted to fitness.<br /><br />Tick is Miles' and Janine's teenage daughter.  Probably a borderline anorexic.  Filled with teenage angst, but a source of comfort to many of her likewise  angst-ridden high school friends.  She lives with her mother, who she can't stand, and spends most of her free time working at the Empire Grill with Miles and her uncle David.<br /><br />Max Roby is Miles' \\"sempty\\"-year old father - a real deadbeat, he thinks nothing of stealing money from Father Tom, the senile retired Catholic priest, or from his own son for that matter.  Max, along with Walt Comeau, is one of the great thorns in Miles' side.<br /><br />Overseeing this cast of characters is Mrs. C.B. Whiting, the last in the line of Whitings that settled in Empire Falls and built the textile Mill and shirt factory.  Mrs. Whiting, nearing seventy years old, and as sharp as a tack, tries to rule her fiefdom with a \\"mailed fist inside a velvet glove...\\"<br /><br />These and many other characters form part of the fabric of Empire Falls, a tiny dot on the central Maine landscape. peaceful, bucolic little community comprised of the noble, the venal, the humble, the vain, the rich, the poor, the beggar, and the thief.  A community soon to be tested by a sudden, unexpected, senseless act of violence...<br /><br />All of these people stumble and struggle their way toward the fulfillment of their hopes and dreams in this masterfully told story by novelist Richard Russo.<br /><br />Two attributes of \\"Empire Falls\\" made this book a distinct pleasure to read, from beginning to end:  first, Russo writes with tremendous wit.  Many of the scenes in \\"Empire Falls\\" are very funny indeed, imbued with the same kind of tragi-comic satirical wit  that graced the pages of  Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22.\\"<br /><br />The second endearing quality of this superb novel is Russo's accurate portrayal of small town life in Maine. Russo's descriptions of the town of Empire Falls - with  its red brick mill buildings dominating the skyline; the old, dilapidated houses; the rusty cars meandering down Main Street;the rusty old iron bridge forming the town's lifeline with the outside world - form powerful mental images of many of the towns in which I've actually lived, worked, and played.  Russo's characters bear a striking resemblance to many people with whom I've associated over the years.<br /><br />\\"Empire Falls\\" is definitely not an \\"action\\" novel.  You're not going to be bowled over by a riveting story line, or a well defined plot filled with thrilling escapades involving heroes and villains.  No, this novel is instead a book that introduces the reader to a group of ordinary people with ordinary fears, anxieties, hopes, and aspirations.  You get to follow them as they struggle through their ordinary lives.<br /><br />MY VERDICT:  \\"Empire Falls\\" is a wonderful novel... rich in detail, literate, alternately funny and tragic, and a powerful statement about small town life in America.  I think it's destined to become one of the enduring novels of our generation.

Like most Americans, I sat transfixed before my TV set on September 11, 2001, completely transfixed by the unfolding disaster on our shores.  Time and time again, I watched that relentless tattoo of images cross my TV screen: hijacked  passenger jets flying at full speed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center; the twin towers of that magnificent structure collapsing to the ground, one right after the other, with thousands of people inside them; and a new generation of heroes -- firefighters and police officers -- working round the clock to find survivors of these horrific events.<br /><br />As I watched events unfold on that fateful day, I kept getting this nagging feeling that this story all seemed too familiar.  Where had I heard it before?  Was it a movie I had seen?  A book I had read?<br /><br />Then I remembered.  Tom Clancy's novel, \\"Debt of Honor.\\"  At the time of its publication in 1994, it was the latest in the continuing saga of Jack Ryan, that fictional Central Intelligence Agency operative in several of  Clancy's previous novels.<br /><br />By the time I read \\"Debt of Honor\\" in 1994,  I had found myself growing  tired of Clancy's books.  Each one seemed infinitely longer than its predecessor, filled with more complex twists and turns of plot; laced with more of Clancy's tiresome  personal political philosophy; and filled with  plots and subplots that seemed progressively more far-fetched.<br /><br />When I finished \\"Debt of Honor,\\" I thought Clancy had really out-done himself by creating a plot that was so unrealistic that it bordered on the ludicrous.  In his usual highly charged,  \\"grab 'em by the throat and don't let 'em go 'til the last page\\" fashion,  Clancy took me on quite a journey.  In retrospect, it was a journey I should have paid more attention to!<br /><br />For me, \\"Debt of Honor\\" was vintage Clancy:  lots of interesting \\"techno-war\\" stuff, but not much else.  Despite being unrealistic to the point of absurdity, the plot is indeed well crafted and quite exciting.  It's pretty easy to get caught up in the chain of events that Clancy creates, even though you, the reader, will probably have a pretty fair idea of where the book is headed by the halfway point...<br /><br />...Or will you?<br /><br />One of the major reasons for the tremendous popularity of Tom Clancy's novels over the years has been their almost uncanny ability to foreshadow future events, as well as future trends in military technology and geopolitical thinking.  One of Clancy's greatest strengths as a writer of fiction is the meticulous research he does before ever setting pen to paper (or, in modern parlance, before cranking up the ol' word processor and \\"inputting data.\\")  Even with their frequently fantastic plots and subplots, Clancy's novels always have a realistic \\"feel\\" to them.  I suppose that's why I continue reading them, even though their plots are wearing thin and seem to reach further and further into the realm of impossibility, thereby rendering the impossible distinctly possible.<br /><br /> \\"Rendering the impossible distinctly possible\\" is exactly what happened with \\"Debt of Honor;\\" for this seemingly incredible plot foreshadowed last September's terrorist attacks in a truly chilling fashion.<br /><br />Last September, life really did tragically imitate art. And, in light of those catastrophic events, the plot of \\"Debt of Honor\\" doesn't seem quite so far-fetched after all.<br /><br />Give Tom Clancy his due.  He did his homework, drew some pretty somber conclusions about what just might happen from his research, and concocted a plot that really should have served as a warning to all of us:  \\"America, let's get our act together... the next time we're attacked, it will be in the least expected ways.  It will involve what our government now calls rather euphemistically \\"asymmetrical warfare.\\"  And we, as a nation, are not prepared to defend ourselves for what is surely coming.\\"<br /><br />Because I pooh-poohed \\"Debtof Honor,\\" as so much \\"Clancy fancy,\\"  judging it \\"too outrageous,\\" I dismissed the author's vitally important message. I suspect a lot of people who read this book might've done the same.<br /><br />In hindsight, it's scary just how accurate a prediction Clancy made in \\"Debt of Honor.\\"  What's even scarier is that he continued sounding the same message in the sequel to this book, entitled \\"Executive Orders.\\"  Its premise: biological weapons in the hands of state-sponsored middle eastern terrorists.of Honor,\\" as so much \\"Clancy fancy,\\"  judging it \\"too outrageous,\\" I dismissed the author's vitally important message.

US	50885600	R1ZO6YQ4O7VKAT	1891620916	299684156	President Reagan: The Role Of A Lifetime	Books	3	48	61	N	N	"Morning again in America"	Two years ago, as part of my efforts at continuing self-education, I set myself a goal: to read a biography of every President of the United States.  The latest addition to the list of Presidential biographies I've read is \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,\\" by Lou Cannon.  Here is an interesting and often controversial look at the man who became the 40th President of the United States.<br /><br />\\"President Reagan\\" is not a biography in the traditional sense.  Instead of covering the life and times of Ronald Reagan,  giving an account of his early life, his first career as a movie star, and his political rise to the top, Lou cannon concentrates on the years 1980-1988  - those years when Reagan served as our Nation's Chief Executive.<br /><br />Cannon, a reporter for the \\"Washington Post\\" for over 30 years, covered Ronald Reagan since the 1970's, when Reagan was governor of California.  Cannon was well acquainted with Reagan and his closest advisors, having forged a friendship with all of them.  Cannon had unparalleled access to how Ronald Reagan and his team worked, both in Sacramento and in Washington, DC.  As a result, he was well positioned to write a book like \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime.\\"<br /><br />When I bought this book, I expected a long an detailed account of Reagan's two terms as President.  I hoped the book would be filled with entertaining anecdotes of what the Reagan White House was like, and with an analysis of the impact of the Reagan presidency on history.  I got what I expected, but not in the \\"way\\" I expected.  And therein lies my problem with \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime.\\"<br /><br />Cannon paints an abysmal picture of Ronald Reagan as President.  The entire book is founded upon the premise that Reagan was emotionally and intellectually unprepared to assume the nation's highest office.  By the time he assumed office, the septuagenarian Reagan is totally disinterested in the day-to-day affairs of running the country. He permits Cabinet members with rival agendas to battle it out, and does nothing to resolve internal political conflicts. Briefings from his advisors are largely ignored; Reagan actually falls asleep in many meetings!  When briefing others, reads from a carefully prepared script, written by advisors on index cards.  When asked to deviate from set-piece situation, Reagan flounders.  All of these problems eventually lead to conflict and confusion in government policy, especially in the are of foreign affairs.<br /><br />Cannon gives a number of concrete examples of how government policy was hampered by Reagan's management style.  Because he delegated authority to his inner circle of advisors completely, his top advisors - Cabinet members all - acted almost like independent agents within their purviews of power.  Results were often disastrous.  Budgets spiraled out of control.  Arms flowed into Nicaragua.  U.S. Marines were killed in Lebanon; and American policy toward terrorism in the Middle East, despite being stated unequivocally as \\"We will never negotiate with terrorists,\\" was inconsistent.<br /><br />Reagan constantly shows his lack of a grasp on public affairs in public.  Reporters ask questions; Reagan stumbles, stutters, and frequently gives answers that are factually wrong.<br /><br />When I finished \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,\\" I had decidedly mixed feelings.  It is a very well written book.  Cannon's text is sharp, lively, and interesting.  It's also easy to understand, containing none of the \\"stuffiness\\" that accompanies many political biographies.  It is also very well researched.<br /><br />My problem with the book stems from having my preconceived notions of Ronald Reagan shattered so bluntly.  Now that I've finished reading \\"President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,\\" I am pondering:  given his popularity and the manifold successes achieved by his administration... was Ronald Reagan really \\"that\\" bad a President?<br /><br />AlthoughI was never a huge fan of Reagan, I tend to think he was actually a pretty good Chief Executive.  It's difficult for me to imagine that he lacked even the most rudimentary political and management skills necessary for a successful presidency.<br /><br />Perhaps the answer to why Reagan was the way he was portrayed in this book lies not with his indifference toward policy making, or managing the executive branch of government.  Perhaps the answer lies in the tragic situation in which Ronald Reagan existed in his last years. Perhaps, unknown to him, his wife and children, his advisors, and the public at large, Reagan was already suffering from the degenerative disease that was steadily and inexorably corroding his memory...<br /><br />We probably will never know; what a pity, however, that  Lou Cannon didn't explore this possibility.<br /><br />MY VERDICT: a good, solid, readable book that will please some and dismay others.  On balance, a fair assessment of Ronald Reagan... well worth reading.I was never a huge fan of Reagan, I tend to think he was actually a pretty good Chief Executive.

Harvard graduate, historian, New York state assemblyman; rancher, Civil Service Commissioner, New York City Police Commissioner, Assistant Secretary of the Navy; Commanding officer of the \\"Rough Riders;\\" war hero; Governor of New York; Vice President, and then President of the United States. All of these accomplishments by the time this extraordinary man reached 42 years of age. Theodore Roosevelt's  historical achievements are indeed most impressive!<br /><br />In his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,\\" biographer Edmund Morris masterfully chronicles the life of this mercurial, complex, and paradoxical man who became the 26th President of the United States.<br /><br />Morris's brilliant narrative depicts Theodore Roosevelt as a man who  towered over his world. Yet who would have guessed at future greatness for this, the oldest son of one of New York's wealthiest and most respected families?  A sickly child, afflicted with constant bouts of asthma and chronic diarrhea, he is seen by his parents as a child \\"with the mind, but not the body...\\" for high achievement.  But the young Roosevelt senses his own potential for greatness and resolves to strive mightily to achieve it...<br /><br />Throughout his life, TR is a man of many paradoxes. Largely self-educated,  he eventually attends Harvard University, from which he graduates magna cum laude in 1880 with a Phi Beta Kappa key in one hand and a membership in Porcellain, Harvard's most prestigious social club, in the other.  The son of a wealthy philanthropist, he eschews the traditional, genteel, upper-class lifestyle in favor of the rough-and-tumble of New York politics.  A member of the Republican party,  he champions progressive reform.  By age 26, he has served two terms in the New York state assembly; has earned the begrudging respect of his colleagues; and has authored several significant pieces of reform legislation.<br /><br />After the death of his first wife, Alice Lee Hathaway Roosevelt, and his mother, Mittie (both women die on the same day, in the same house) TR flees New York, heading to the harsh, uncompromising Dakota Badlands to earn his living as a cattle rancher and writer of history books. Here, in this barren  country, a startling transformation takes place.  The thin, sickly youth of sallow skin and frail constitution becomes the muscular, tanned, robustly healthy man known to history.<br /><br />\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" vividly demonstrates how this intensely energetic politician used his forceful personality in the cause of badly needed reform at all levels of American government.  As Morris points out, Roosevelt puts his personal stamp on nearly everything he undertakes.  As Civil Service Commissioner during the Harrison administration, he publicly - some say bumptiously  - investigates claims of graft and corruption within the Civil Service.  He alienates many colleagues, but achieves lasting results.  During his tenure, the Civil Service expands dramatically, despite fierce political opposition.  The same holds true for TR's tenures as president of the New York City Police Commission (1895-97) and Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1897-98.)<br /><br />In 1898  a series of unexpected events propels TR to national prominence.  When war breaks out  between the United States and Spain, TR asks for and receives commission in the New York National Guard.  Soon he has assembled a tough group of cavalrymen called the \\"Rough Riders\\" - friends from his days at Harvard and in the old west.  On July 1, 1898, TR and his grizzled band of soldiers will enter the pantheon of American heroes at a place in Cuba called San Juan Hill...<br /><br />After the Spanish-American War, TR returns to New York and runs for Governor.  After a tough, closely fought campaign that features former \\"Rough Riders\\" endorsing their candidate, TR is elected by a razor-thin margin of 18,000 votes out of nearly 1.1. million votes cast.TR will only spend a year in the governor's mansion, though. By 1900, New York's \\"old pols\\" have had enough of Roosevelt's attempts to force progressive reforms through a recalcitrant, conservative New York legislature. Considering TR \\"too dangerous\\" to keep on as governor, they make an arrangement to get Roosevelt on the national ticket.  McKinley agrees, and an Roosevelt enthusiastically becomes McKinley's running mate.<br /><br />In November 1900, McKinley easily wins re-election and Theodore Roosevelt becomes Vice President of the United States.  Ten months later, on September 6, 1901, at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, President William McKinley is gunned down by a young anarchist...<br /><br />Not since I read William Manchester's two-volume \\"The Last Lion\\" biography of Winston Churchill have I read a book that's as good as \\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt.\\"  Make no mistake:  this book is as good as biography gets!  Here is the powerfully eloquent story of one of the most gifted and controversial men of the twentieth century, and perhaps even of all time.<br /><br />\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" reads almost like a novel. I haven't found a single part of  this book that I would classify as \\"dry\\" or boring.  In fact I found it pretty hard to put down once I started reading it. Part of the reason for that, I suppose, is because TR's life was so darned fascinating to begin with; but give Edmund Morris his due.  He has told the story of Theodore Roosevelt with tremendous style and panache.<br /><br />\\"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" is a fair and balanced biography, although Edmund Morris displays an obvious affection for his subject.  Morris combines an intellectually stimulating and literate historical narrative with brilliantly insightful  historical analysis. Roosevelt's less attractive qualities - his impulsiveness, his emotionalism, and his attempts at self glorification among others - all receive full coverage in this masterful book.<br /><br />Edmund Morris has written an extremely readable, highly entertaining, and factually sound biography.

Very rarely do I find a small book that combines outstanding writing style, historical accuracy, impartiality AND brevity.  One such volume is the Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation\\" by Joseph J. Ellis.  This is an absolutely brilliant work, encapsulating in only 287 pages one of the most important and yet least understood eras in American history: the two decades  immediately following the American Revolution.<br /><br />The years 1783-1804 were the most critical in our nation's history - the  years immediately after the United States had gained its independence from Great Britain as a result of the American Revolution,.  During these two decades bridging the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the United States, under the leadership of the same revolutionary \\"band of brothers\\" that had struggled to guide the fledgling American nation through six years of war against its colonial masters, embarked upon the great experiment of establishing a republican form of government free from the fetters of  colonialism.  During these formative years, the U.S. Constitution was adopted as  the supreme law of the land; a republican form of government was established; and America began to take its place among the nations of the world.<br /><br />\\"Founding Brothers\\" examines this critical juncture in American history and asks:  how did the United States succeed at its great experiment when so many other nations had failed? At the outset, Ellis points out a fundamental fact that we readers in the twenty-first century are likely to forget:  that this was the first time in history that colonies had broken away from their imperial masters and successfully established  a new nation.  In Ellis's view, independence from Britain was probably inevitable, but had the Revolution not occurred when it did, independence would have in all likelihood evolved over the course of the nineteenth century. The Revolution did occur, however,  and the American nation was successfully founded upon the ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  Why?<br /><br />\\"Founding Brothers\\" ascribes the success of the American enterprise primarily to the revolutionary generation of Abigail and John Adams, Aaron Burr, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and  George Washington.  These seven men and one woman collectively formed the catalyst that led to the establishment of the new American nation.  They were successful in part because they were an elite - they had been tried in the crucible of the Revolution and had  been successful; they were intellectually and politically powerful; they knew each other; and they were aware of their contributions to posterity.<br /><br />Each chapter of \\"Founding Brothers\\" recounts an event in the lives of the people who made up the revolutionary generation.  A few of those events are momentous; most are not. All of the events discussed in this book are examined in detail in the context of how the \\"founding brothers\\" reacted to them, and the effects of those events on the history of our nation.  We learn what really led to the infamous duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr, and what happened on that fateful day.  We discover the great compromise that led to the selection of the site nation's capital at its current location, along the banks of the Potomac; how \\"The Silence\\" - the lack of public debate over the issue of slavery, tacitly agreed to by both sides in the debate  - was broken for a short time, and why.<br /><br />We observe George Washington as he prepares his Farewell Address to the nation, and come to a deeper understanding of why he eschewed a third term as President.  We watch as partisanship marks the political landscape for the first time in 1796, when it became known that the Presidency was \\"up for grabs.\\"  We witness two lifelong friends - Thomas Jefferson and John Adams - become estranged from each other over deeppolitical differences.  And we see them reconcile through a decades-long correspondence after both had left the Presidency.<br />It didn't take me long to read \\"Founding Brothers\\" from cover to cover... about 2½ days.  It's an extraordinarily well written book!  Joseph Ellis is a historian with an eloquent narrative gift.  His prose never flags; it is always lively, informative and entertaining, even when he's analyzing events rather than narrating them.<br /><br />Ellis's judgments and analyses are excellent.  He  portrays the seven \\"founding brothers\\" (eight if you count Abigail Adams) in a generally sympathetic light, although he's careful to maintain a judicious balance.  He repeatedly makes one particular point in \\"Founding Brothers\\" that I found especially salient.  The \\"founding brothers\\" took the risk of gaining independence from Britain and establishing a new nation  without any idea of what the future would bring.  They were acutely aware that their actions would leave a legacy of some kind, but there was simply no paradigm to follow... no other revolution had ever been successful, and no other nation had ever been established upon the right of its citizens to self-government.<br /><br />We Americans of the twenty-first century have the luxury of looking back over two centuries of history; we know how successful their experiment was!  Their lasting legacy to us is embodied in the fact that they willingly risked \\"their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor\\" without any idea of  what the future would hold.<br /><br />\\"Founding Brothers\\" is one of the finest books on American history I've read in many years.  Lively and entertaining, judicious in its approach, and completely respectful of its subject matter, this book is sure to appeal to all readers with a desire to learn more about the men and women who founded our great nation.political differences.  And we see them reconcile through a decades-long correspondence after both had left the Presidency.<br />It didn't take me long to read \\"Founding Brothers\\" from cover to cover... about 2½ days.

His prose never flags; it is always lively, informative and entertaining, even when he's analyzing events rather than narrating them.<br /><br />Ellis's judgments and analyses are excellent.  He  portrays the seven \\"founding brothers\\" (eight if you count Abigail Adams) in a generally sympathetic light, although he's careful to maintain a judicious balance.  He repeatedly makes one particular point in \\"Founding Brothers\\" that I found especially salient.  The \\"founding brothers\\" took the risk of gaining independence from Britain and establishing a new nation  without any idea of what the future would bring.  They were acutely aware that their actions would leave a legacy of some kind, but there was simply no paradigm to follow... no other revolution had ever been successful, and no other nation had ever been established upon the right of its citizens to self-government.<br /><br />We Americans of the twenty-first century have the luxury of looking back over two centuries of history; we know how successful their experiment was!  Their lasting legacy to us is embodied in the fact that they willingly risked \\"their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor\\" without any idea of  what the future would hold.<br /><br />\\"Founding Brothers\\" is one of the finest books on American history I've read in many years.  Lively and entertaining, judicious in its approach, and completely respectful of its subject matter, this book is sure to appeal to all readers with a desire to learn more about the men and women who founded our great nation.	2002-03-16

Written by Robert L. Middlekauff, Professor of History... this is the finest account of the Revolutionary War I've found to date... even better than Benson Bobrick's &#34;Angel in the Whirlwind,&#34; which I've already reviewed.<br /><br />&#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; is a comprehensive account of the American Revolution designed to give readers a well rounded overview of not only the causes of the war, but also of how the war was fought. The book succeeds admirably at its task. After finishing &#34;The Glorious Cause,&#34; I felt a much greater appreciation for the men and women whose struggle for freedom brought forth on the North American continent a new and independent nation - the United States of America.<br /><br />&#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; begins by examining the causes of the American Revolution. In one of the book's earliest chapters, entitled &#34;The Children of the Twice Born,&#34; Middlekauff carefully lays out his closely reasoned and well argued thesis: that the seeds of revolution were planted long before the war was actually fought. Those seeds, embodied in the economic, social, political, and religious fabric of American society, made the evolution to democracy on the North American continent almost inevitable.<br /><br />The earliest settlers came to the New World because of their disenchantment with authoritarian English laws and what they viewed as centralized, overly ritualistic, dogmatic Anglican religion. When the settlers arrived with their ideals of political and congregationalist religious democracy, they found land cheap and plentiful. Whereas only about 20 percent of all Englishmen were landowners, and hence were eligible to participate in England's parliamentary democracy, over 50 percent of American colonists owned land and therefore could take part in colonial parliamentary government. The result: provincial representative assemblies tended to do the bidding of their constituents rather than the royal governors. After the Seven Years' War, tension between American political and economic interests and the interests of the British government was exacerbated by Parliament's intent to restore Britsh prerogatives in America.<br /><br />Tension was bound to lead to conflict, and that conflict wasn't long in coming. The American colonies were left pretty much to their own economic and political devices during the Seven Years' War, so long as they provided support for Britain's war against the French. The colonists bore the brunt of the fighting during the war against the French in North America; at war's end, they expected to be permitted to return to some semblance of self-government. It was not to be, however. Under Britain's new King and a Parliament with a new-found awareness of the American colonies' potential to enrich their colonial masters, Parliament began enacting a series of laws (Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Sugar Act, etc.) designed to bring the colonies to heel. The colonists, thoroughly imbued with the ideals of democracy and liberty, rebelled, first through political means, and finally, inevitably, through violence.<br /><br />Once &#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; completes its assessment of the causes of the war, it takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the war itself. The way the American Revolution was fought is frequently shrouded in the mists of legend, with great American heroes standing tall against the overwhelming might of the British and Hessian armies. There are strong elements of historical truth to that legend, but Middlekauff does an excellent job of portraying the war exactly as it was: a very closely contested fight between colonial masters and those who wished to throw off the yokeof colonialism.<br /><br />There's really almost nothing to criticize in &#34;The Glorious Cause.&#34; It is, in nearly every respect, an outstanding work of history. It's comprehensive in its scope; thorough in its approach; obviously very well researched; and imbued with careful, thoughtful, and incisive historical analysis. Middlekauff's descriptions of Revolutionary War battles are first-rate. The author completely captures the flavor of eighteenth century warfare in general, and of the battles of the American Revolution in particular. When I finished reading &#34;The Glorious Cause,&#34;  I felt as if I had actually been there at some of the great battles of the war.<br /><br />One very minor caveat: because &#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; takes a fairly academic approach to studying the American Revolution, the book's somewhat lofty and scholarly sounding language may not appeal to readers with only a passing interest in history in general, and the American Revolution in particular. That's not to say the book has only a narrow appeal to academics and history scholars, however; it is definitely written for the general reader with a love of American history. It will, in my view, prove a most satisfying experience for the vast majority of history lovers who decide to read it.<br /><br />&#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; is a winner of a book in every respect. With a dearth of excellent books about the American Revolution currently in print, this volume fills a crucial need for those who wish to learn about America's struggle for independence. As the inaugural volume of the &#34;Oxford History Of The United States,&#34; &#34;The Glorious Cause&#34; also sets the tone for the whole series... highly readable, thoroughly imbued with first-rate scholarship and a polished, eloquent writing style; and simply a pleasure to read.of colonialism.<br /><br />There's really almost nothing to criticize in &#34;The Glorious Cause.&#34; It is, in nearly every respect, an outstanding work of history.

This is a real crackerjack of a mystery novel, folks... chock-a-block full of interesting characters; a tightly knit, thrilling plot; and enough twists and turns to keep even the most hard-boiled reader of mysteries squirming uncomfortably from start to finish.<br /><br />On a cloudy, blustery, uncommonly cold early July day in rural Kansas, at a lonely highway crossroads, a simple traffic accident has just resulted in the murder of two innocent people.  Three hardened criminals have captured a school bus with eight deaf school girls and their two teachers on board...<br /><br />Amidst wind-buffeted, golden Kansas wheat fields, FBI negotiator Arthur Potter must begin bargaining for the release of the hostages.  For hour after tense hour, Potter calmly, but with a growing feeling of desperation, tries to win release of the hostages  By now, the young girls are being kept in a room with an incendiary \\"booby trap\\" installed.  As Potter continues his negotiations, some of the girls decide to take matters into their own hands, with frightful results...<br />\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" is the first of Jeffrey Deaver's books that I've read, but it certainly won't be the last!  This is wonderful storytelling all the way!  Deaver brings us a completely believable, well researched, and thrilling plot; \\"good guys\\" that, despite their manifold flaws, are easy to root for; and \\"bad guys\\" that quickly earn our enmity.<br /><br />Deaver immediately grabbed my  attention on the first page of the book, and never let go.  In quick succession, I was transported from a school bus making its way along a deserted highway, to a cemetery where Arthur Potter is tending his wife's grave and two FBI agents approach with a new assignment, and then to a Kansas crossroads where a collision between two cars results in cold blooded murder.  Soon Deaver had me completely engrossed with his straightforward but vivid prose.  For many hours I was unable to put \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" down... I just HAD to find out what happened next...<br /><br />Deaver's characters are rich and detailed.  The \\"good guys\\" aren't without their flaws... The \\"bad guys\\" are evil personified.  I wasn't able to find a single redeeming quality in any of them throughout the book's 419 pages.<br /><br />Deaver's treatment of the subject of deafness is worthy of a great deal of praise.  He spends a great deal of time describing the plight of the eight school girls and their teachers, and in all cases, his hearing impaired characters are treated with compassion and accuracy.  In no case is there any evidence of stereotyping in Deaver's character development.  Deaver should be commended for his research, his compassion, and his sensitivity in dealing with the subject of hearing loss.<br /><br />\\"A Maiden's Grave\\" is not your typical crime thriller/mystery novel.

US	50885600	R1LD1LOBJFGLPU	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	13	18	N	Y	"The colossus of American independence"	David McCullough has done it again!  McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of several previous superb works of history and biography (most notably, \\"Mornings on Horseback,\\" \\"The Path Between the Seas,\\" and \\"Truman\\"), has written a wonderfully well rounded picture of a man to whom every American owes a tremendous debt of gratitude.  John Adams' many contributions to establishing this great Nation of ours, and the freedoms we cherish, are incalculable.  He was indeed, in the words of Thomas Jefferson, the \\"colossus of American independence.\\"<br /><br />\\"John Adams\\" is literate, elegant in tone, entertaining, and, above all, highly informative. It's not, however, your typical Presidential biography.  In this masterful book, there's much less emphasis on the political career of its subject, and more weight given to Adams' personal life.  And it was indeed an extraordinary life!<br /><br />In 1735 John Adams is born into a middle class family in Quincy, Massachusetts.  During his childhood and youth, his father decides upon a career in the ministry for his son; but John has other plans.  He wants to become a lawyer.  After attending Harvard, he practices law intermittently until the outbreak of the American Revolution.<br /><br />During the years before the war, he meets and marries the great love of his life, Abigail Smith Adams. Throughout their long lives together, this extraordinary woman remains a  tremendously positive influence on him.<br /><br />Adams is one of the earliest to realize the inevitability of American independence from Britain. His arguments in favor of independence  are always lucid, logical, easy to understand, and have broad popular appeal.  Adams' service to America continues throughout the Revolutionary War years and beyond.  He serves as an American delegate to the Paris Peace conference, and, after the war, as an American minister in Europe.  In 1788, Adams is recalled to the United States, after  faithfully serving his country in the courts of Europe for nearly eight years, three of them separated from his beloved Abigail and their children.<br /><br />Later in 1788, he is elected Vice President of the United States, an office he holds for the next eight years.  Finally, in 1796, he is elected President of the United States.  It is the first contested election in American history.<br /><br />Adams' Presidency is marked by two notable achievements, one of them positive and the other negative.  In what Adams considered his greatest accomplishment, he prevents a war with France over the issue of French privateers attacking American ships.  His most negative achievement is the signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts, a set of laws that gave the President the legal right to expel any foreigner he considered dangerous, and made \\"writing against the government, Congress, or President... crimes punishable by fines and imprisonment.\\"<br /><br />Adams' four years as Chief Executive are also marked by political wrangling unknown in America up to that time.  Throughout his term, he is hounded by his political enemies.  Foremost among them is Thomas Jefferson, a former friend and the leader of the newly created \\"Republican\\" party.  Jefferson accuses the Federalist Adams of having \\"monarchical\\" tendencies; of advocating a pro-British foreign policy; and of attempting to destroy the republic by concentrating power in a strong central government.  Adams is unable to fight back effectively against these charges.  In 1800, he loses his bid for re-election to Jefferson.<br /><br />The last quarter-century of Adams' life is spent in relative obscurity in Quincy.  During this period, he experiences tremendous sadness and joy.  His son Thomas dies prematurely from alcoholism, and daughter Nabby dies from cancer at age 49.  His beloved Abigail follows their children to the grave a few years later, leaving Adams alone after over 50 years of marriage.  Adams is consoled by a renewed friendship with his old nemesis, Thomas Jefferson.  They will carry on a decade-long correspondence that heals old wounds.<br /><br />In 1824, John Adams experiences perhaps the moment of pride in his nearly nine decades-long life: he sees his son, John Quincy Adams, become President of the United States.<br /><br />In one of the great historical ironies of all time, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson - the last surviving signers of the Declaration of Independence - will die on the same day:  July 4, 1826.  It is the 50th anniversary of the adoption of that immortal document that both labored so hard to help create.<br /><br />When I picked up \\"John Adams\\" for the first time, I hadn't really paid much attention to the historical figure who became the second President of the United States.  After all, the career of this short, stocky, seemingly colorless man, whose one term as President was marked by controversy, political wrangling, and an apparent lack of great accomplishment, was nowhere as interesting as the careers of our more famous and charismatic Founding Fathers.<br /><br />\\"John Adams\\" filled in many gaps in my knowledge of this great man.  From this magnificent and highly informative book, I learned not only many  facts about Adams' life that I didn't know before, but I also learned about the kind of man Adams was.  McCullough goes to great lengths to give readers a glimpse of the true character of this extraordinary man.<br /><br />As with all books authored by David McCullough, \\"John Adams\\" is brilliantly written with McCullough's trademark mellifluous, elegant prose.  The book reads more like a well crafted historical novel than a straight biography.  Readers will find it lively and entertaining on every page.<br /><br />\\"John Adams\\" is the finest biography of America's second President available to general readers.

US	50885600	R3CEG3LJK25WNN	0446525804	472682750	Last Man Standing	Books	3	27	31	N	N	Traitor? Coward? Or fall guy?  You decide.	Over the past few months, I've been trying like the dickens to broaden my reading horizons just a bit. My latest foray into the world of fiction was \\"Last Man Standing,\\" the latest novel by David Baldacci.  This is one of those books that I should have loved... but didn't .  It falls into the genre of murder mystery/\\"techno\\"-thriller... much like Tom Clancy's books minus all of Clancy's geopolitical machinations and neo-conservative posturing.  It's an interesting story told by an author with writing skills that can best be described as \\"nothing special.\\"<br /><br />\\"Last Man Standing\\" is the story of name of Web London,  a thirteen-year veteran of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, who sees all six of his teammates shot to pieces during an assault on a drug trafficking ring. Web is the only man to escape death.  For some reason, when the signal to move forward is given, he finds that he cannot walk, run, or even stand up.  It's almost like he's paralyzed.  He desperately wants to join in the fight, but he's physically in no condition to do so.  He lies on the pavement, fully conscious of the slaughter going on around him, and unable to help in any way.<br /><br />What follows is Web's attempts to find out why he was left the \\"last man standing.\\"  He's considered by many to be at best a coward and at worst a traitor. He's left feeling guilty and despondent.  He decides to seek psychiatric help.  The story takes readers on a journey from FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia, through some of the seamiest parts of the nation's capital, and to the gorgeous horse farming country of northern Virginia.  Readers are introduced to a plethora of characters, all part of a sinister plot against the FBI and Web London in particular.  Read the book to find out what happens to our hero!<br /><br />There are about as many good things to say as bad  about \\"Last Man Standing\\"  On the plus side, the story is well conceived, the premise believable, and the plot nicely developed.  Baldacci does a very good job keeping his focus throughout the book's 548 pages.  The story never wanders very far from where the author intends it to go.  Even those seemingly small sub-plots (and there are a lot of them) tie in nicely at the end of the novel.  The book is easy to read and understand.<br /><br />So much for the \\"plus\\" side.  \\"Last Man Standing\\" is plagued with some significant flaws.  First and foremost, I found the characters - all of them - flat and uninspired.  None of them engendered in me any passion one way or the other.  I tend to like books where I, the reader, can like or dislike characters with a passion.  How else would it be possible for me to root for the \\"good guys\\" or heap scorn upon the \\"bad guys?\\"  Without strong feelings for the book's characters, what incentive is there to read on?<br /><br />Another problem: while the central story line of \\"Last Man Standing\\" is well focused, it tends to be very predictable.  So predictable, in fact, that I found myself correctly guessing the final outcome of the book by the time I'd reached page 250; I also was able to predict what type of situation would occur a few pages down the road.  Baldacci certainly didn't make \\"Last Man Standing\\" a particularly suspenseful novel, that's for sure!<br /><br />My final gripe concerning \\"Last Man Standing\\" is Baldacci's writing style.  His prose is crisp, clear, and unambiguous, but  also too simplistic for my tastes.  I like literary prose best when it's edged with a bit sarcasm, humor, pessimism, or a myriad of other stylistic tinges that the most successful authors use.  I think fictional prose should challenge the readers' intellect just a bit.  Yet, Baldacci's writing is almost completely devoid of these characteristics.  It's bland, almost like salt-free popcorn or chips.  It provides no challenge to the intellect, no room to stop and think about characters or situations and draw conclusions, no challenging vocabulary or sentence structure to \\"tickle\\" the intellect, much as Caleb Carr did so successfully in his novel \\"The Alienist...\\"<br /><br />MY VERDICT:  With sincere apologies beforehand if I sound sexist here, but \\"Last Man Standing\\" is a \\"guy\\" book all the way.  Every testosterone-tinged page of this novel is replete with big guns, muscle cars, and guys doing either impossibly heroic deeds or unspeakably villainous ones.  In many ways it's a well written book, but it falls far short of being the kind of \\"rock `em, sock `em, seat-of-the-pants\\" thriller that I like best.  In short, it's a nice, entertaining few days' read, but nothing that says \\"Read me!

In the late summer of 2001, before the terrorist attacks of September 11th turned every American's world upside-down (gosh, that seems like an eternity ago now!!) a ten-week mini-series began on the Home Box Office (HBO) cable network.  That mini-series, entitled \\"Band of Brothers,\\" told with exquisite eloquence the story of one of the most famous U.S. Army units to fight during World War II.<br /><br />The book that forms the basis of this particular HBO mini-series is \\"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest.\\" Written by noted historian and biographer Stephen E. Ambrose, it is, in every way, an extraordinary book!  Imbued with Ambrose's trademark simple eloquence, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is an uncommonly powerful narrative of one of the most storied units in U.S. Army history: Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.<br /><br />That unit had  its beginnings on the hot, swampy training grounds of south Georgia; fought its way with uncommon courage on some of the bloodiest battlegrounds of Europe during World War II; suffered over 150 percent casualties during its illustrious wartime career; and disbanded in the summer of 1945, only a few weeks after the defeat of Germany.  By the end of the war, Easy Company was one of the most decorated units to have fought in any theater of operations.<br /><br />My review here cannot even begin to do justice to Stephen Ambrose's magnificent narrative in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  This book  is a real departure from the kinds of books previously written by Ambrose.  In his other works of history, books like \\"Undaunted Courage,\\" \\"D-Day,\\" and \\"Nothing Like It in the World,\\" Ambrose casts a historian's dispassionate, unbiased eye on his subject and relates his story with complete neutrality.  Not so in \\"Band of Brothers!\\"  This is a personal story... one written to cast a spotlight on the brave men who served their country so bravely and nobly on the battlefields of Europe in World War II.<br /><br />Ambrose introduces us to men like Herb Sobel, the incompetent martinet who was Easy Company's first Commander; Dick Winters, the complete antithesis of Sobel (and Sobel's nemesis as well) who became so beloved by the men of Easy that they followed him anywhere; Lewis Nixon, another brilliant officer who, despite being plagued by alcoholism, proved a tremendously capable and courageous leader; Carwood Lipton, the company first sergeant, another extraordinary leader whose courage and example eventually earned him a battlefield commission; and other noncoms, like Bill Guanere, John Martin, and Shifty Powers, whose courage under fire held the company together during its darkest hours.  In every case, Ambrose helps us get to know, and I mean really KNOW,  the patriotic men who were the heart and soul of Easy Company.<br /><br />Ambrose's descriptions of battle are second to none in this book.  Relying on first-hand accounts of Easy Company veterans (Winters, Lipton, Guanere, and Powers among them), Ambrose has constructed a narrative that brings the reader right into the heart of battle.  I found myself completely captivated by the accounts of Winters leading his patrol against the German 88's; and the heartbreaking losses in Holland and the incredible suffering during the siege at Bastogne.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" is a relatively short book, running to just over 300 pages.  Each and every one of those pages comes alive with Ambrose's brilliantly constructed narrative, written in his simple yet eloquent writing style.  Fair, judicious, and yet warmly sympathetic to its subject, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is as good a book about war and the courageous men who fought it as one is likely to find anywhere.

It's a book that doesn't attempt to break any new ground with \\"revisionist\\" historical theories. Instead, readers will find a good solid narrative of the events that led up to the Revolution, and of the war itself.<br /><br />\\"Angel in the Whirlwind\\" begins by tracing the roots of the American Revolution. According to Bobrick, the American concept of liberty was born in the crucible of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763).  During this period, colonial legislatures took it upon themselves to govern themselves. They regulated their own commerce and levied their own taxes with almost no interference from the British government. After the Seven Years' War ended, the British government once again began exercising its prerogative to regulate colonial commerce and impose new taxes. The result: political protest that eventually evolved into open rebellion.<br /><br />Most of \\"Angel in the Whirlwind\\" concerns itself not with an analysis of the war's causes, but with the fighting of the war itself. Bobrick masterfully traces the major battles of the War for Independence, from the \\"shot heard `round the world\\" at Lexington, Massachusetts, on April 19, 1775, to the final surrender of Lord Cornwallis' forces to General George Washington at Yorktown, Virginia, on October 19, 1781. In between these key events, readers will be swept along by the tremendous courage of colonial troops at Bunker Hill, Long Island, Trenton, Princeton, and Saratoga; the incredible suffering at Valley Forge and Morristown, New Jersey; and the internecine conflict between Loyalist and Patriot throughout the war...<br /><br />Although Bobrick's battle descriptions are fairly brief (the book only runs to 495 pages) they are clear, concise, well organized, and imbued with superb historical accuracy. You won't get that \\"gunpowder, smoke, and chaos of battle\\" feel that you'll gain in such books as Richard Ketchum's \\"Decisive Day\\" and \\"Saratoga;\\"  you will, however, gain an appreciation for the hardships and suffering endured by those who fought, and sometimes died, on the battlefields of the Revolution.<br /><br />In \\"Angel in the Whirlwind,\\"  Benson Bobrick eloquently captures the sweep and scope of the founding of our nation. Although this book is imbued with tremendous scholarship, it's never boring. Bobrick keeps an excellent pace throughout his well crafted narrative. Bobrick's analyses of events are carefully constructed and his arguments lucid and effectively explained. At certain points, he even manages to interject a bit of humor into his narrative. I found myself quite amused by his descriptions of British General \\"Gentleman Johnny\\" Burgoyne's personal entourage, during his 1777 campaign through the thickets of Canada and upstate New York.<br /><br />\\"Angel in the Whirlwind\\" is one of the best contemporary surveys of the American Revolution available today. It's not the most detailed, and it doesn't provide any new historical revelations; but it's scholarly, entertaining and easy to understand, and will provide readers with an excellent background to our nation's War of Independence.

Theodore Roosevelt (TR) became one of our greatest Presidents. Early in life, his sense of \\"noblesse oblige\\" caused him to choose a career in politics rather than a life as a member of the wealthy elite.  He was elected, in turn, state representative; then governor of New York,  as a Republican.  He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy in the McKinley Administration.  Three years later, he was elected Vice President of the United States, and succeeded to the Presidency  when President William McKinley was assassinated on September 14, 1901.  His seven years as Chief Executive were some of the most successful of any Chief Executive up to then.<br /><br />Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was a young man who appeared to have little of his cousin Theodore's intellectual acumen, driving ambition, or ideological bent. Franklin followed his famous cousin into politics, but unlike his cousin, Franklin became a Democrat.  Like Theodore, Franklin's political career advanced steadily. In rapid succession, he was elected State Assemblyman, then State Senator.  By age 31, he had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by President Woodrow Wilson.  In 1921, FDR was stricken with polio, which paralyzed him from the waist down. In 1928, after a seven-year hiatus from politics, FDR was elected Governor of New York. After two highly successful two-tear terms as Governor, he was elected President of the United States in 1932.<br /><br />The third of the \\"three Roosevelts\\" - Eleanor (ER) - was an integral part of her husband's political success.  After her marriage to FDR, Eleanor remained indifferent toward politics, although she steadfastly supported her husband's political ambitions.  As FDR's political career progressed, so did Eleanor's interest in politics. In fact, she was much more of an ideologue than Franklin. Burns and Dunn imply that Eleanor grew to have a tremendous influence on Franklin, possibly pulling him more and more to the left of center during his Presidency.<br /><br />In the years following FDR's death in 1945, Eleanor Roosevelt continued to be a major influence on American politics. Through her nationally syndicated newspaper column \\"My Day,\\" ER continually interjected her ideas and opinions into the national debate. She was appointed as an American delegate to the first organizational meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. Later she would serve on a UN commission that authored the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. She championed the cause of equal rights for all Americans, and was vocal in her support of the new nation of Israel.<br /><br />When \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" appeared in 2001, I eagerly bought a copy. My hope was that Burns and co-author Susan Dunn would provide a penetrating examination of what caused this trio of extraordinary individuals to leave behind the values and traditions of their 19th century \\"patrician\\" class, in favor of a progressive and at times socialistic political agenda.  It is a question left largely unanswered.  \\"The Three Roosevelts\\" remains a book very long on biographical information and very short on historical analysis.<br /><br />The authors show an almost complete lack of objectivity toward their subjects. Burns is well known as a liberal \\"New Deal\\" Democrat, and his political bias shows on practically every page. He is ably abetted by Dunn.  The result:  \\"The Three Roosevelts\\"  is practically a paean of praise to TR, ER, and especially FDR.  Criticisms of the \\"three Roosevelts\\" are few, and even those are largely muted.  Burns and Dunn's unabashed, gushing admiration of the \\"three Roosevelts\\" is annoying, and limits the usefulness of the book as an objective study of these fascinating characters in American history.ean of praise to TR, ER, and especially FDR.

At the outset, he's a dreamy, idealistic teenager in the small town of Walt Whitman, Nebraska. He's the night clerk in the local hotel and eatery. He's possessed with a first class intellect and a fiery ambition to &#34;do something great with his life.&#34; He dreams of getting an appointment to West Point.<br /><br />Sam applies for admission to the U.S, Military Academy, but gets impatient at the bureaucratic delays. He enlists in the Army, serves with General John J. Pershing in the 1916 &#34;punitive expedition&#34; to Mexico, and ends up in the trenches of France a year later, during the last year of World War I. It is there that Sam performs his greatest act of military heroism, an act that earns him a battlefield commission as a Second Lieutenant; the Medal of Honor; and the affectionate sobriquet &#34;The Night Clerk.&#34; Throughout his tour of duty in France, Sam continues to distinguish himself not only with valorous deeds on the battlefield, but also with his no-nonsense leadership style, centered upon his passionate dedication the welfare of his men. He consistently sets a superb example of the highest ideals of personal behavior in his dealings with both his superiors and subordinates. It is here that he begins to understand the ultimate futility of war.<br /><br />It is also here that he has his first encounter with his lifelong &#34;bête noire,&#34; Courtney Massengale. Massengale is the complete antithesis of Sam Damon and everything he stands for. Like Damon, he's keenly intellectual and ambitious, but he seeks recognition and career advancement through being in the right place at the right time; currying favor with his superiors; and his incessant political maneuvering. His disdain for his subordinates is evident during his first encounter with Sam Damon shortly after Damon's unit comes &#34;out of the line&#34; in France.<br /><br />Throughout their parallel careers in the Army, most of which occurs in the years between the two World Wars, Massengale, the unctuous West Point graduate, and Damon, the heroic &#34;mustang&#34; (a term of respect for officers with prior enlisted service) occasionally find themselves stationed together, and almost always on opposite sides of whatever issues confront them at any given moment. Their relationship comes to a head in the heat of battle against the Japanese the Philippines during World War II, and again, two decades later, in the jungles of Southeast Asia.<br /><br />The Damon/Massengale relationship forms one of the central themes of this wonderful novel. For, in this relationship can be found a study in personal ethics as it applies to those not only in military life but also in the business sector as well. Through these two disparate characters, Myrer asks a fundamental question about human nature: why do people who rely on slipshod ethics and oleaginous double-talk so frequently successful at the expense of those whose moral compass is based on a well defines set of noble values and principles? It's a question that's plagued society from its inception, and such an important question that the U.S. Army War College includes a study of &#34;Once An Eagle&#34; as part of its curriculum in advanced leadership training for senior officers.<br /><br />&#34;Once An Eagle,&#34; originally published in 1968, was re-released in a beautifully bound hardcover edition in 2000. It's newly billed as &#34;...a classic novel of soldiers and soldiering.&#34; It is indeed that, but it's also much more. For, at its heart, this beautifully crafted novel is one of the finest ANTI-war novels I've ever read. Anton Myrer, himself a veteran of some of the bloodiest fighting in the Pacific theater during World War II, pulls no punches in his condemnation of war. His battle scenes are consistently tough, gritty, highly descriptive accounts of men fighting against other men. He describes combat on the most human terms... from the perspectives of those who did the fighting and dying. Myrer takes the reader inside the minds of his characters, allowing the reader to understand the character's hopes, fears, anxieties, and physical torments...<br /><br />&#34;Once An Eagle&#34; is a long book - over 1200 pages - but it's well worth reading. Anton Myrer's style is polished and highly literate. Despite its length, it's actually a fairly quick read. I finished it in about 10 days. The book always held my interest, and in places, actually proved difficult to put down. It is an eloquent condemnation of war and its effects on the human soul.

Remini's  masterful three-volume Jackson biography comprised of \\"Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Empire;\\" \\" Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Freedom;\\"  and \\"Andrew Jackson: The Course of American Democracy.\\"<br /><br />Normally, I shy away from reading single volume abridgments of multi-volume works.  In this particular case, I ended up reading the shorter version  AFTER  I had finished Remini's longer, more detailed triptych.  As abridgments go, \\"The Life of Andrew Jackson\\" is decently written. It encapsulates the long and controversial life of Andrew Jackson clearly and succinctly. Unfortunately, it has one glaring flaw: it lacks much of the fine detail I look for in presidential biographies.<br /><br />Exactly who was this extraordinary man who became our nation's chief executive?  Born in 1767 in South Carolina, Jackson was  Revolutionary War hero by age 12.  As a young man, in Tennessee,  he became a lawyer,  judge,  major general of the Tennessee militia. He made his fortune as a land speculator; married the great love of his life, Rachel Donelson.  He killed at least two men while fighting several duels; the wounds he received while duelling caused him lifelong pain.<br /><br />Jackson gained national stature as a military hero. His most famous victory came on January 8, 1815, at the end of the War of 1812.  It was there he led American forces to an overwhelming victory over the British in  the Battle of New Orleans.<br /><br />After losing in the 1824 Presidential election to John Quincy Adams, Jackson was elected President of the United States in 1828; a champion of majority rule in America, he passionately believed that the office of President was the only one that represented all the people, and that the president must be obedient to the will of all the people.  Jackson's party became the Democratic party that lasts to this day.  His political opponents became \\"National Republicans,\\" then \\"Whigs,\\" and finally, in the 1850's, the Republican party that exists today.<br /><br />When Andrew Jackson died in 1845, at age 78, his legacy was vast indeed.  He left behind an America transformed by democratic principles; a nation which had taken its rightful place among the nations of the world; a nation of peace and prosperity.  But, also a nation about to be riven by the simmering dual controversies of states' rights and slavery.<br /><br />Robert V. Remini's biographies of Andrew Jackson are imbued with the highest degree of scholarship, and brilliantly capture the essence of this towering figure in early nineteenth century history.  Because Remini uses a wonderfully conversational writing style, the pace of the story never flags and the reading never becomes dry or stuffy.  That's true even when Remini discusses political and economic issues.<br /><br />\\"The Life of Andrew Jackson's\\" primary flaw is its brevity.  I think Remini cut far too much detail from this abridgment to do Jackson the level of justice he deserves.  It touches too lightly on many aspects of Jackson's life and times.  I got the feeling that \\"The Life of Andrew Jackson\\" was deliberately left too short in order to encourage readers to opt for the three-volume set.<br /><br />If you only want to familiarize yourself with the basics of Andrew Jackson, without going into any substantial detail, \\"The Life of Andrew Jackson\\" is the ideal book for you.  You'll find a neat, brief encapsulation of the man and the President.

So, over the course of three nights last spring, I journeyed back to 1946 and re-lived the life and crimes of Don Vito Corleone, that fictional Mafia chieftain trying to bring his \\"family\\" into the post-World War II world as a legitimate enterprise.<br /><br />When I first read \\"The Godfather\\" in 1971, I didn't like it very much.  I didn't think it was particularly well written; I thought Puzo's style was simplistic and \\"ham-fisted.\\"  My second reading of  \\"The Godfather\\" certainly changed my opinion of the book!  I don't know what caused my opinion to change... maybe repeated viewings of the movie did it, or possibly a much more mature taste in, and understanding of, what makes for excellence in literary fiction. I now understand that what I once saw as a \\"ham-fisted\\" style is really Puzo's deliberate means of narrating his story in the tough street language of New York, in the harsh, raw criminal culture he so vividly portrays. I now think \\"The Godfather\\"  is a genuinely good book.  Hey, its MUCH better than \\"good;\\" its one heckuva great read!!<br /><br />\\"The Godfather\\" is a sprawling novel with, ironically, a very tight plot.  What I didn't see the first time I read it, but now fully appreciate, is just how masterfully Puzo takes complex little sub-plots (like Sonny Corleone's inability to control his temper; Connie Corleone's domestic squabbles with her loser husband Carlo Rizzi; and Michael Corleone's relationship with, and subsequent marriage to Kay Adams), interweaves them into the whole cloth of the book, and then, at the last minute, makes all of them part of the cataclysmic \\"grand finale\\" of the book.<br /><br />Now, THAT,  folks, is  powerful writing!!

That film was the groundbreaking, multi-part documentary  \\"The Civil War,\\"  by Ken Burns, Ric Burns, and Geoffrey C. Ward.  A few months after  \\"The Civil War\\"  was broadcast, I found \\"The Civil War: An Illustrated History,\\"  the  companion book to the film,  in our local bookstore.  It is authored by the same trio responsible for the film. (Geoffrey Ward is the principal author, ably assisted by the Burns brothers.)<br /><br />\\"The Civil War: An Illustrated History\\"is an outstanding book - like its film counterpart, an excellent work of history, powerfully written by gifted writers with a genuine passion for their subject. Ward and Burns have written a graceful and eloquent basic survey of the Civil War that even the most battle-hardened Civil War buffs will find a wonderful reading experience.<br /><br />The authors provide a straightforward narrative of events without much historical interpretation of events.  That doesn't mean there isn't any analysis of historical events, however.  In what I consider an act of literary genius, Ward and Burns enlisted the help of some of America's greatest Civil War historians - writers like James McPherson , Shelby Foote,  Barbara J. Fields, and the late C. Vann Woodward.  These outstanding historians, and others, wrote a series of essays that provided outstanding analyses of the causes, effects, and events of the Civil War.<br /><br /> \\"The Civil War: An Illustrated History\\"is far more than a few hundred pages of stuffy historical text.  It's as visually appealing as it is wonderful to read.  Nearly every page is crammed with Civil War era paintings, photographs and maps. The paintings add tremendous color to each page, but the photographs that pack the REAL emotional wallop!  Many of them were taken by famed Civil War photographer Matthew Brady.  In this book you'll see famous photographs, like Brady's renowned portraits of Lincoln, Grand and Lee; and other, starker, but less famous pictures, like the Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, and Petersburg battlefields as they appeared in the days following their respective battles.<br /><br />\\"The Civil War: An Illustrated History\\"is one of those rare \\"companion\\" books that not only complements the PBS film series from which it originates; it towers alongside it.

I bought this book, along with several videos, late last year.  I now have at my fingertips a concise, clearly written, judicious, and authoritative reference book that catalogs and provides essential information about  films from every historical era.<br /><br />\\"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide\\" is a wonderfully comprehensive reference book designed as much for occasional moviegoers as it is for hardened film addicts like myself.  It's hard to believe that between the covers of this 3-inch thick paperback reside over 20,000 entries!!<br /><br />The book is very simply and effectively organized.  All entries are listed in alphabetical order. Each of the book's entries contains the following information:  the movie's title; the year it was released; whether it's black-and-white or color; the film's length (in minutes); the director and cast; a short, informative review of the film; the aspect ratio in which the film was shot (e.g., Widescreen, Panavision, CinemaScope; etc.); and the MPAA rating (G, PG-13, R, NC-17).<br /><br />What really makes this book an essential reference for movie lovers is the ratings and reviews included in each listing.  Films are rated from BOMB to 4 stars, in half-star increments. Each review, usually only a few sentences long, shows excellent judgment in most cases. Each review is just enough of a \\"teaser\\" to give readers an idea of what they can expect from the movie from the standpoint of the film's plot, its quality, and its entertainment value.<br /><br />The ratings/reviews section form the core of  \\"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide\\" but there's a lot of additional useful information included in this volume.  In it, you'll find:  Maltin's list of \\"100+ Recommended Family Films;\\" a reasonably inclusive list of places from which you can rent or buy videos through the mail; a glossary of widescreen formats; and a cross-reference listing of every major star named in the book, along with the movies in which they appeared.<br /><br />\\"Leonard Maltin's 2001 Movie and Video Guide\\" has consistently been a great help to me in selecting videos and DVDs to rent or buy.

Ambrose, is a  highly readable account of the building of  America's Transcontinental Railroad in the mid-nineteenth century. It's the story of the fulfillment of a decades-old dream to link America from Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. It's also a book that's created a firestorm of controversy in the years since its publication.<br /><br />According to Ambrose, the dream of a transcontinental railroad began in the 1830's. During this decade, the United States was in the midst of forty years of peace. There were many local railroads  linking towns and cities throughout the United States, most notably in Illinois, Ohio, and California. Still, there was no railroad joining the heavily populated eastern United States with its west coast territories.  This became the vision of many entrepreneurs and politicians, most prominently Abraham Lincoln, who said in 1832:  \\"...no other improvement...can equal in utility the rail road.\\"<br /><br />In 1849, the discovery of gold in California gave new urgency to the building of a transcontinental railroad. Most people who headed west in search of gold had to cross the great plains and desert southwest in covered wagons,  sail around the southern tip of South America, or traverse  the isthmus of Panama on foot.<br /><br />By the 1850's, surveyors had begun searching for possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. The American  Civil War interrupted their efforts; when the Civil War ended, political support for the railroad continued to be strong, even after Lincoln's assassination. It seemed like everyone of importance wanted to see the transcontinental railroad built.<br /><br />\\"Nothing Like It in the World\\"  is less a story about the politics behind the building of the transcontinental railroad as it is a tale about how the railroad was actually built, although  the book's early chapters are devoted to telling the story of the men who founded the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads,  and of their efforts to get support from the Federal government for their endeavors.<br /><br />The vast majority of this book tells the tale of the ordinary people - mostly immigrants, Mormons, ex-Confederate soldiers, and other laborers - who frequently sacrificed life and limb to build the railroad. These were the ones who surveyed routes, laid road beds, built bridges, excavated tunnels, set down ties and track, and drove spikes across the heartland of America.<br /><br />The Central Pacific Railroad began its journey eastward from Sacramento, California in 1865. At almost the same time, the Union Pacific began construction westward from Omaha, Nebraska.  On May 10, 1869, the thirty year-old dream of a transcontinental railroad was finally realized at Promontory Summit, Utah.  On that date, the final spike that joined the two tracks and connected the east and west coasts of the United States was driven.<br /><br />When I first read \\"Nothing Like It in the World,\\" I thought it was an excellent book. Ambrose's descriptions of the construction process are superb;  the best qualities of Ambrose's writing - his colorful descriptions of people and events and his easy to read narrative style - are always present.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these  strengths are offset by the book's many flaws and controversies.  Since  its publication, \\"Nothing Like It in the World\\" has come under close scrutiny and fierce criticism for its allegedly slipshod research, factual errors, and \\"made-up quotes;\\" as a result, it has lost a great deal of credibility.  Before his death, Ambrose apologized for his errors, and promised to correct them in future editions.<br /><br />I have decidedly mixed feelings about \\"Nothing Like It in the World.\\" Although I thoroughly enjoyed it for its readability,  its many flaws cause me to question its usefulness as a scholarly work of history. Readers should consider other, more detailed,better researched, and historically accurate books on this subject - most notably \\"Empire Express\\" by David Haward Bain - before turning to \\"Nothing Like It in the World.\\"better researched, and historically accurate books on this subject - most notably \\"Empire Express\\" by David Haward Bain - before turning to \\"Nothing Like It in the World.\\"	2001-02-21

Authored by Fred Anderson, Associate Professor of History at the University of Colorado, Boulder, \\"Crucible of War\\" is the first major study of the Seven Years' War since \\"Montcalm and Wolfe,\\" Francis Parkman's classic account of the war, written in 1884. It is, in my view, of equal historical and literary quality as its esteemed predecessor.<br /><br />\\"Crucible of War\\" is notable not only for its exquisite prose and tremendous scholarship, but also because it takes an historically less traditional approach to the French and Indian War than most previous accounts.  The author argues persuasively that this was actually a world war involving Britain, France, Spain, and other European powers.  The war in North America was the spark that ignited this worldwide conflict, and the effects of the war in the New World were especially significant because they ended in France's decisive defeat, and a \\"dramatic rearrangement of the balance of power in Europe and North America alike.\\"<br /><br />The immediate catalyst for the Seven Years' War was the dispute between Britain and France over the Ohio Valley, a dispute which came to a head in 1754 when George Washington led a small force of Virginia militia into the area around present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to drive out the French. Unsuccessful in his mission, Washington unknowingly engaged the French in the first battle of a war which would ultimately deprive France of her North American empire.<br /><br /> From 1754 through 1758, the British suffered a succession of humiliating defeats at the hands of the French and her Indian allies.  During this period, Britain had also drifted into a general European war with France, and suffered a string defeats in Europe as well.  The turning point in British fortunes actually came in 1757.  William Pitt, a Minister of the British government, changed British colonial policy, which treated the colonies as \\"subordinate jurisdictions,\\" to one which treated the colonies as allies in a struggle against a common foe. He also began the process of replacing inept military commanders with more professional ones - men like James Wolfe and Sir Jeffrey Amherst. Pitt's efforts paid tremendous dividends during 1759 - the Annus Mirabilis - the \\"Year of Miracles\\" - when British fortunes were permanently reversed with stunning victories in North America and in Europe.<br /><br />Anderson's narrative accounts of the war's major military and political battles are very well written and intriguing; however, I found the most fascinating aspect of this book to be how Anderson treats the years after the war, and the effects of those years on later events. The author counters a widely held historical view that many key events which occurred after the war - from 1763 to 1766, when the book closes - were precursors to an inevitable American Revolution.  Instead, Anderson sees the historical events of the 1760s as an unanticipated shift in relations between Britain and her colonies, the result of a nation trying to regain control over subjects in the New World.  Neither Britain nor her colonies could have foretold the coming of an American Revolution; nor did either side desire such a conflict.  The historical events which we Americans now understand as being seminal to the ultimate independence of the United States are viewed in this book as a natural evolution in relations between Britain her colonies.<br /><br />\\"Crucible of War\\" is an exceptionally well written book - perhaps one of the very best works of American history I've read in recent years! Anderson has imbued his work with tremendous scholarship. As I read it, I was constantly amazed at how easily Anderson was able to convey facts about all aspects of the war. With great facility, he moves the reader from military events in NorthAmerica to battles in Europe; from the internal politics of Indian tribes and colonial governments, to the inner workings of British and French government ministries. Anderson's painstaking research, and keen eye for historical detail are obvious throughout this book, much to the benefit of the reader. \\"Crucible of War\\" is a book of outstanding scholarship, and \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in American history.America to battles in Europe; from the internal politics of Indian tribes and colonial governments, to the inner workings of British and French government ministries.

Perhaps no Russian leader has been as much of a driving force within his own nation and the world of his times than the Romanov Tsar who ruled Russia two centuries before our own: Peter the Great (1672-1725).  In his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography \\"Peter the Great: His Life and World,\\" historian Robert K. Massie masterfully chronicles the life of this mercurial, complex, and paradoxical man who became the greatest Tsar in Russian history, and perhaps one of the greatest figures in all of European history.<br /><br />Massie's brilliant narrative depicts Peter as a man who towered, both literally and figuratively, over his world. When he reached full adulthood, he stood six feet seven inches tall.  He was a man possessed with many paradoxes... an absolute autocrat who disdained the glitter, trappings, and ceremonial pomp of his royal station, preferring instead a simpler, more unadorned lifestyle.<br /><br />Forced to abandon his formal education at an early age, he continued his education informally, becoming largely self taught and reasonably literate in the process. He derived his greatest pleasures from working with his hands. It was he who built, almost single-handedly, the first boats of what would eventually become the Russian navy; it was also he who laid the plans for, and personally built much of the Russian city which now bears his name: St. Petersburg.<br /><br />The main thrust of \\"Peter the Great: His Life and World\\" is not so much an examination of Peter's personal qualities (although Massie's portrayal of Peter the man is nothing short of masterful), but of how he used the force of his personality to transform Russia, during his lifetime, from a backward medieval kingdom of little consequence into a major European political and military power. Massie devotes the vast majority of Peter the Great to spin a highly detailed, absorbing, and wonderfully written narrative of the events which led to Peter's - and Russia's - evolution.<br /><br />From his \\"Great Embassy\\" at age eighteen, when he traveled incognito to all the major western European capitals (becoming the first Tsar to do so), to his numerous wars with the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey), to his ten-year long \\"Great Northern War\\" with Sweden and its king, Charles XII, Peter is seen as forcing the pace of events throughout Europe, thereby modernizing and expanding Russia and planting the seeds of future greatness for the nation he loved above all else.<br /><br />Robert K. Massie has continued his fine tradition of writing extremely readable, highly entertaining, and factually sound biographies. With \\"Peter the Great: His Life and World,\\" he completely captures the essence of this towering eighteenth century figure, and does it in such a way as to make him totally relevant to today's readers.

Indeed, perhaps no American work of fiction fits the label of &#34;The Great American Novel&#34; better than Steinbeck's wonderfully written and still highly controversial masterpiece of fiction.<br /><br />Set in the 1930's, in America's &#34;Dust Bowl,&#34; this is the tale of the Joad family, a large clan of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, and how they are forced into a decision to migrate to California. It's also the story of the many trials and sufferings that they endure during their long and harrowing journey.<br /><br />Forces of nature and the forces of economics have conspired to force the Joads off their farms. So, this proud, hard-working family, sells most of their worldly possessions in order to buy a run-down old jalopy. The whole family - Ma and Pa; Granma and Granpa; Tom (the oldest son, and an ex-convict recently paroled from prison); Al (Tom's younger brother); Uncle John (Pa's brother); Ruthie and Winfield (Ma and Pa's youngest children); the heavily pregnant Rose of Sharon (Tom's younger sister) and her husband Connie; and the Reverend Jim Casy (a family &#34;friend&#34;) - pack themselves, along with their essential goods, aboard their decrepit old vehicle, and depart for the &#34;promised land&#34; on America's west coast.<br /><br />The vast majority of this compelling novel tells the story of the Joads' plight while on the road. They are almost immediately confronted with the death of a loved one. This compounds their grief at the loss of their home and possessions. They find that most people they meet along the way despise, reject, and vilify them as dirty, filthy &#34;Okies;&#34; they receive aid and comfort from very few along their route. Yet, they remain undaunted; throughout their struggles, they remain focused on the ultimate realization of a dream: jobs, high pay, and a new life in California.<br /><br />The great climax of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; sees the Joads once again suffering in unspeakable squalor as they attempt to survive the violent forces of nature and humanity in this, the great western &#34;promised land.&#34;<br /><br />The basic plot of &#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; is exciting, suspenseful, gripping, and possessed with a terrible beauty. It is written perhaps in the finest traditions of the early twentieth century &#34;muckraking&#34; novels, exposing, as it does, the worst societal ills that were prevalent in American society of the 1930's.<br /><br />This book serves as Steinbeck's soapbox, as he deplores the exploitation of California's migrant workers during this era. Indeed, the author is frequently barely able to contain his moral outrage at the sufferings of thousands of &#34;Okies,&#34; and their often violent treatment by landowners, businessmen, and even law enforcement officials.<br /><br />&#34;The Grapes of Wrath&#34; abounds with wonderful character studies. The effects of indescribable suffering and abject poverty give Ma Joad the steel to evolve from her traditional role as a silent, obedient wife to become the true leader of the family. Conversely, Pa Joad's traditional role seems to diminish; he recognizes the fact, and, after only brief resistance, he defers to his wife's new role. Tom, ever so careful not to do anything to jeopardize his parole at the outset, finds himself increasingly outraged at his family's plight, and emboldened to action as a result.<br /><br />This novel's central theme is still as relevant today as it was in 1939: the growing disparity between the &#34;haves&#34; - the rich - and the &#34;have nots&#34; - the poor. Perhaps this is the real reason why the book still generates such controversy. It holds a mirror up to us, and forces us to confront some unpleasant truths that we, as an &#34;enlightened&#34;society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading.society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading.	2000-12-31

This is a book about the Civil War, and  one Union soldier's struggle with his inner demons as he prepares for, and  fights his first battle.<br /><br />Although the story Crane tells is deceptively  simple, it reveals, better than any other novel I've read, the full horror  of war, and the complexity and unpredictability of human behavior in the  crucible of battle. Henry Fleming (always referred to by Crane as &#34;the  youth&#34;) is a young northerner who, despite his mother's objections,  enlists in the Union army with great patriotic fervor. As he awaits his  first battle, the youth ponders how he will react: will he stand and fight,  or will he flee? The answer comes soon enough. His regiment is attacked by  the Confederates; at first the youth stays to fight, but, during a second  attack, he watches other soldiers run away from battle in a state of panic.  He himself is overcome by fear, and he too flees.<br /><br />The youth finally  reaches a state of exhaustion and stops running. Immediately, his  conscience begins to gnaw at him. He hears rumors that his regiment has  actually stood and won the day against its foe. His thoughts and emotions  begin to run the gamut from rationalization, to self-loathing, to fear of  being discovered a coward. He continually looks for ways to justify his  flight. The youth hears the continuing sound of battle in the distance, and  is drawn to it, almost as a moth to a flame; he decides to return to his  regiment, but loses his way.<br /><br />As he tries to find his way back to his  regiment, he is confronted by people who serve to prick his conscience even  further. He witnesses the horrible death of Jim Conklin, one of his friends  from his regiment. While walking with a group of wounded soldiers, he is  asked by one tattered and probably insane soldier what the nature of his  wounds are. Shamed by this inquisition, he runs away, afraid he'll be  uncovered as the poltroon he is beginning to believe himself to be. He  begins to wish for a &#34;red badge of courage&#34; - a wound - which  would signify his bravery in battle. He gets his wish in a roundabout way  when he attempts to ask another soldier for directions. He gets into a  scuffle and is cut on the head with the soldier's rifle. This becomes his  &#34;red badge&#34; when he finally makes it back to his unit; he lies to  his comrades-in-arms, saying he received the wound as a result of being  shot in the heat of battle.<br /><br />Ultimately, the youth is afforded another  opportunity to prove his courage in battle. How he reacts under fire during  this new test of his character and courage is the great climactic event of  &#34;The Red Badge of Courage.&#34; Henry's behavior reveals the lessons  he has learned about himself , and shows how he is able to come to terms  with his inner demons and the world around him as a result of those  lessons.<br /><br />Crane's writing is excellent on most levels. His descriptions  of the insane violence of battle is graphically intense, and of reasonable  historical accuracy. The one noticeable weakness in Crane's style is his  dialogue. Although it is raw and gritty, it is also somewhat unrealistic;  all his characters sound like they have southern accents, even though they  are supposed to be from New York and other northern states. Still, the  dialogue is effective in conveying the essential truth of who did most of  the fighting on both sides during the Civil War: tough, profane, and often  poor and uneducated men, many who did not know of, or care about, the  causes for which they fought and sometimes died.<br /><br />In my view, what sets  &#34;The Red Badge of Courage&#34; apart as one of the finest Civil War  novels of all time is Crane's brilliant analysis of Henry Fleming's state  of mind as he runs away frombattle and then attempts to redeem himself.  Through Crane's lively pen and sometimes purple prose, I was able to peer  into the youth's very soul and understand some of his fears, hopes,  intermittent self loathing, and frequent rationalizations, and how those  emotions and attitudes drove his behavior during battle. Henry Fleming is  certainly not an admirable protagonist! (This may, in fact, have been the  first Civil War novel which depicts the central character in less than an  idealistic, &#34;knightly&#34; fashion.) He is immature, vain, shallow,  and mendacious throughout the book, but is also imbued with an inner  strength and the self-discipline which allow him ultimately to triumph over  his many character flaws.<br /><br />&#34;The Red Badge of Courage&#34; is indeed  a timeless masterpiece of American fiction. It is easy to understand why it  ranks alongside such great American novels as Harriet Beecher Stowe's  &#34;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&#34; John Steinbeck's &#34;The Grapes of  Wrath,&#34; and &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird,&#34; by Harper Lee.  &#34;The Red Badge of Courage&#34; is a book to be read and savored!battle and then attempts to redeem himself.

Shelby Foote's &#34;The Civil War: A Narrative&#34; has been described  by critics and readers alike as &#34;...a classic of its kind.&#34; It  took Foote 16 years and over 2,800 pages to tell the story of America's  bloodiest and most tragic war. &#34;The Civil War: A Narrative&#34; is a  long journey, but one I found well worth taking. Foote is a master at  weaving the personalities and events of the Civil War into a seamless and  often captivating narrative. One of the great beauties of this trilogy is  Foote's ability to hold the reader's interest (he held me spellbound  through all three volumes) for the long haul with his sparkling, almost  musical prose.<br /><br />Of course, all the major battles - from Fort Sumter to  Appomattox, with stops at Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Vicksburg,  Chancellorsville, The Wilderness, Cold Harbor, and others - fairly leap, in  all their horror, from these volumes' pages at the hands of this gifted  writer. But Foote goes one better. Less famous battles (i.e., Pea Ridge,  Perryville, The Seven Days), minor skirmishes, and other events, which  receive short shrift or a passing reference at best in most one-volume  accounts of the Civil War, receive much fuller treatment here. (Two prime  examples of this are General U.S. Grant's seven failures on the Mississippi  River as he attempted to get his army below Vicksburg, and Colonel Benjamin  Grierson's cavalry raid through Mississippi in 1863.)<br /><br />Despite the claims  of some critics who accuse Foote of &#34;Southern bias&#34; in his  writing, I found the author's account of the Civil War to be both fair and  objective.  The three volumes also appear to be well founded on solid  historical research. However, I would have preferred to see footnote or  endnote citations of the author's sources, a more comprehensive  bibliography.<br /><br />&#34;The Civil War: A Narrative&#34; is a wonderful  reading experience.

I especially  enjoyed reading the two Inaugural addresses of Abraham Lincoln, who is my  favorite President.

To me, the Lewis and Clark expedition ranks as one of the greatest voyages of discovery in human history.  Because of the scientific and geographical discoveries that were made, it stands in significance alongside the travels  of Marco Polo, the journeys of Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan,  and James Cook, and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon.<br /><br />This one-volume  edition of Lewis' and Clark's masterpiece is outstanding in every way.  Edited by the late Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Bernard DeVoto  (1897-1955), it allows the reader to gain a fuller understanding of the  Lewis and Clark expedition through the words of Meriwether Lewis and  William Clark themselves.<br /><br />Lewis and Clark's expedition begins in 1804,  taking the 33-person Corps of Discovery from St. Louis, Missouri to the  Pacific Ocean and back again (a distance of over 8,000 miles).  Among other  things, it results in the initial exploration and mapping of the Great  Plains and Pacific Northwest, and the description and classification of  over 100 never-before seen species of flora and fauna.  In addition, it  dispells the myth of a northwest passage to the orient, and opens up the  vast central and western regions of the continent to commerce with the  United States.<br /><br />Captain Meriwether Lewis, the commander of the Corps of  Discovery, is instructed by President Thomas Jefferson to keep a journal of  the  daily events, scientific observations, and  measurements of latitude  and longitude along the way.  Both he and his co-commander, Captain (in  reality Lieutenant) William Clark follow Jefferson's instructions, although  not always faithfully.<br /><br />Lewis and Clark return from their 30-month long  expedition as national heroes. Jefferson expects Lewis to oversee the quick  publication of the Journals, but Lewis, for a variety of reasons,  disappoints the President.  He fails miserably as governor of the Louisiana  territory; he suffers from depression and alcoholism. In 1809, he (it is  surmised by historians) takes his own life, never having submitted so much  as one page of the Journals' manuscript to an editor.  After Lewis'  suicide, Clark teams with editor Nicholas Biddle and completes a short,  narrative version of the Lewis and Clark journals. Published in 1814, it  contains none of the scientific data compiled during the expedition. Not  until 1904 are the Journals of Lewis and Clark published in their entirety,  with all of the explorers' scientific observations included.<br /><br />Bernard  DeVoto begins this volume with a well crafted 60-page introduction that  explains the historical background to the Lewis and Clark expedition.  Then, DeVoto gets out of the way and allows Lewis, Clark, and, on occasion,  other members of the Corps of Discovery, to convey with their own words the  drama, excitement and high adventure of this magnificent undertaking.  Most  of the more routine scientific data has been edited out, leaving behind  Lewis and Clark's outstanding descriptions of the expedition's key  events.<br /><br />It is not easy to forget Lewis' florid prose, through which he so  emotionally and enthusiastically describes his initial sighting of the  Great Falls of the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains, or his encounters with  the Nez Perce' and Blackfoot native tribes.  DeVoto does, however, keep in  a few of the more famous journal entries dealing with scientific  observations.  Lewis' descriptions of the wildlife, plants and physical  geography along the route of the expedition show him to be a gifted  naturalist, perhaps one of the finest in history.<br /><br />One not of caution:  while they are  very enjoyable,  \\"The Journals of Lewis and  Clark\\"  have a tendency to make for taxing reading.  This is because  the editor left Lewis' and Clark's grammar and spelling almost completely  intact.  (Both men had an excellent ability to hold their readers' interest  with their colorful and dramatic prose, but theywere both atrocious  spellers.)<br /><br />This edition of  \\"The Journals of Lewis and Clark\\"  is highly entertaining and well researched.

Ambrose's masterfully told and compelling account of The Lewis and Clark expedition, one of the most historically significant  journeys of exploration in  American history.<br /><br />Relying extensively on the Journals of Lewis and  Clark, Ambrose has put together a highly entertaining, meticulously  researched, wonderfully  readable, and fast paced narrative that  interweaves a fascinating biography of Meriwether Lewis with a spellbinding  account of the Lewis and Clark expedition.<br /><br />Ambrose captures completely  with his fast-paced narrative the key events of the Lewis and Clark  expedition. With a keen eye for detail, he describes the formation of the  Corps of Discovery; its ascent to the headwaters of the Missouri River and  its many encounters with native tribes along the way; the crossing of the  \\"Great Portage,\\" the Continental Divide, and the Rocky Nountains;  and its encampment in November 1805 on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, at  the mouth of the Columbia River.  Also described is the expedition's return  voyage, when the expedition once again searched in vain for a water route  to the Pacific, and also when the expedition had its one and only hostile  engagement with natives.  Finally, Ambrose describes  the aftermath of the  expedition - how the Journals of Lewis and Clark came to be published, and  the divergent (and, for Lewis, ultimately tragic) careers of these two  great explorers.<br /><br />I found Ambrose's portraits of the key players in this  real-life drama to be superb! Lewis is a born naturalist with a keen eye  for scientific observation.  He's also a gifted leader of men, ever  conscious of his subordinates' welfare, and always gaining  from them  loyalty that is complete and willingly given.  Clark, the  \\"co-captain\\"  (in reality the second in command), is a less  gifted scientist, but equal to Lewis in leadership ability, and in many  ways a more talented explorer and map maker.  Jefferson, perhaps America's  greatest genius of the Age of Enlightenment, is the man possessed with the  vision to see that the voyage is undertaken.  Sacagawea, the teenage  Shoshone girl, kidnapped from her tribe, sold to Canadian traders, and the  mother of a newborn son, is  possessed with remarkable stoicism and  diplomatic skills which become essential to the Corps of Discovery's  survival. In addition, Ambrose proves himself to be a first-rate nature  writer himself, with his breathtaking descriptions of the flora, fauna, and  physical beauty  of the American Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and Pacific  Northwest.<br /><br />\\"Undaunted Courage\\" is America's great adventure  story, told by one of this nation's foremost contemporary historians and  biographers.

I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography. It turned out to be much more than just a summertime reading diversion...it became for me  a deeply moving reading experience in its own right. I was quickly  captivated by Marty and his family, Shiloh, the beagle, and yes, even the  despicable Judd Travers.<br /><br />The story is straightforward: Marty Preston is  an eleven-year old boy living with his parents and two younger sisters in  rural West Virginia. It is a close-knit, loving family with traditional  values and a clearly defined set of rules to live by. His father is a mail  carrier and his mother a homemaker.<br /><br />One Sunday afternoon, as Marty is  walking along a backwoods road, he spies a young beagle hiding under a  bush. He calls to it, but the dog doesn't respond. When Marty walks away,  the dog follows him. Marty tries to get the dog to come to him several  times, but the animal, which has obviously been abused, cowers miserably.  Finally, the dog happily comes to Marty when the boy whistles at him. Marty  immediately falls in love with the dog, whom he names Shiloh. The little  beagle responds with trust and affection. The boy quickly figures out that  Shiloh belongs to Judd Travers, a local ne'er-do-well, and a man with an  unsavory reputation for dishonesty, a hot temper, and animal abuse. Marty  wants to keep Shiloh, to protect him from Judd. However, his parents insist  he return the dog to its rightful owner, which Marty begrudgingly  does.<br /><br />Shiloh runs away from Judd a second time and finds his way back to  Marty's house. This time, Marty vows to keep him. He hides the dog, sneaks  food out of the house to feed him, and begins to lie to friends and family  when questioned about Shiloh's whereabouts. A tragic accident causes  Marty's secret to be found out by his parents. He is forced once again to  return Shiloh to his master. Marty, desperate to keep Shiloh, offers to do  almost anything to get Judd to give him the dog.<br /><br />I won't give away the  ending of the book; suffice it to say, it is a dramatic and compassionate  ending, sure to move anyone who reads this book.<br /><br />\\"Shiloh\\" is a  beautifully and masterfully written in every way. It is written in the  first person, from Marty's point of view. The narrative is written in a  rural West Virginia dialect that sounds totally natural and unaffected. It  seemed almost possible for me to hear Marty speak as I read along. The  book's plot is absolutely superb - tightly woven, dramatic, and realistic.  Each of the characters come to life with complete believability. All of the  situations presented in the narrative are easy to understand and  appropriate for young readers.<br /><br />Phyllis Reynolds Naylor proves why she is  such a gifted writer of children's books, mainly because she so brilliantly  fires the reader's imagination and teaches positive values. In the story,  she presents Marty with an ethical dilemma which, at one time or another,  all children face. Marty's predicament is this: whether to do what is right  in the eyes of a higher authority (his parents) when it is a reasonable  certainty that the action will result in a great wrong being done by  someone else; or to do what his heart says is right, even though that  action is wrong in the eyes of the higher authority (his parents). Marty's  dilemma is compounded his conscience, which speaks loudly and often to him,  demanding from him both honesty and a sense of fair play. How Marty  responds to these challenges is the great lesson taught by this  book.<br /><br />\\"Shiloh\\" is a winner of the Newbery Medal and a classic  of children's literature. I heartily recommend it to kids of all  ages...from 9 to 99.te to keep Shiloh, offers to do  almost anything to get Judd to give him the dog.<br /><br />I won't give away the  ending of the book; suffice it to say, it is a dramatic and compassionate  ending, sure to move anyone who reads this book.<br /><br />\\"Shiloh\\" is a  beautifully and masterfully written in every way.

In dramatic fashion, Ryan superbly tells the story of Operation &#34;Market-Garden,&#34; biggest single airborne assault in history up to that date.<br /><br />It is late summer, 1944. Adolf Hitler's armies in Western Europe have been retreating steadily from France, Belgium and the Netherlands ever since D-Day, when Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France and began moving like a juggernaut toward the German border. All signs point to a completely demoralized German army, made up primarily of old men and young boys. The German occupiers flee through the Low Countries on bicycles, in carts, and on foot. By September 1944, it seems only a matter of time before the Third Reich collapses under the relentless assault of the Allies.<br /><br />British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery has a bold plan to win the war in 1944. Called &#34;Market-Garden,&#34; Montomery’s plan calls for Allied forces to seize and hold a series of bridges spanning the Rhine River on the border between Germany and The Netherlands. The capture of these bridges will give the Allies the route they need for the invasion of the German homeland. If successful, &#34;Market-Garden&#34; could spell victory for the Allies in 1944.<br /><br />The plan is ambitious and, on the surface, well thought out. It will have two parts: &#34;Market&#34; will be the airborne assault. Allied forces will land and seize the bridges along the Rhine. The key bridge - the linchpin of the whole operation - will be the bridge at Arnhem. The &#34;Garden&#34; portion of the plan is an armored ground assault by a column of tanks that will travel 80 miles to provide relief to the paratroopers holding each of the bridges. However, Monty's plan has not taken into account the possible presence of  seasoned German troops in the area…<br /><br />&#34;Market-Garden&#34; begins on September 17, 1944, and initially looks headed for success. However, trouble soon looms on the horizon for Allied paratroopers. Read Ryan’s masterful narrative to see how the battle unfolds, and how it ends!<br /><br />I found &#34;A Bridge Too Far&#34; to be one of the best books about World War II I've ever read - better, even, than Ryan's earlier book &#34;The Longest Day.&#34; Ryan writes a masterful account of this tragic battle. His narrative is gripping and dramatic throughout. He incorporates many first-person accounts of the participants in the battle from all sides - Allied, German, civilian, and Dutch underground. With an historian's eye for factual interpretation, Ryan exposes the political wrangling that went on at the highest levels of the Allied command, and the many miscalculations and errors that marked the Allied planning and execution of &#34;Market-Garden.&#34;<br /><br />With a journalist's unfailing eye for factual accuracy and detail, Ryan describes with spellbinding realism the fighing on the ground and in the air. Throughout the book, Ryan never loses sight of the human dimension - the sometimes superb and more often erroneous judgments made by Allied and German generals and colonels; the extraordinary valor of the ordinary soldier on both sides, officer and enlisted man alike; and the dedication and sacrifice of civilians and the Dutch underground.<br /><br />&#34;A Bridge Too Far&#34; is a wonderful work of history, one which I heartily recommend to all readers!tember 17, 1944, and initially looks headed for success.

Written by Neil Sheehan, a former Southeast Asian correspondent for United Press International (UPI) and later \\"The New  York Times,\\" this book combines a biography of John Paul Vann,  considered by some to be \\". . . the one irreplaceable American in  Vietnam,\\" with a spellbinding narrative of the miscalculations,  blunders, and self-deceptions which marked America's decade-plus  involvement in Vietnam.<br /><br />John Paul Vann's career in Vietnam spanned a  decade, from its beginning in 1962 with Vann as U.S. Army Lieutenant  Colonel and advisor to the South Vietnamese, to its end in 1972 with his  death in a helicopter crash, Vann having become the civilian equivalent of  a two-star general. During his decade in Vietnam, Vann was consistently  frustrated and angry with the pusillanimous and corrupt performance of  South Vietnamese forces and the frequent incompetence of American senior  political and military leaders. He repeatedly urged his superiors, through  normal channels and in the press, that the U.S. government could not defeat  the Communist forces in South Vietnam with its military might alone. The  war could only be won by the South Vietnamese with American assistance.  That help, Vann recommended, should take the form of facilitating social  change and providing military equipment and advice. By the time of his  death, however, Vann's views had changed. After the near destruction of the  Vietcong during the 1968 Tet offensive, he came to believe that America  could indeed achieve a military victory in Vietnam.<br /><br />Sheehan explores  every aspect of Vann's life with the keen eye of the best biographers. Vann  is seen at his best: possessed with a first-rate intellect and a singleness  of purpose which led him to rise above a childhood filled with poverty and  neglect; highly patriotic and courageous; and imbued with a strong sense of  professional integrity that gave him tremendous credibility at the most  senior levels of the U.S. government. Also seen is Vann's darker side: his  ability to manipulate others to his ends; his dark sexual compulsions  (which ultimately led him to ruin his marraige and endanger his career);  his callousness toward his friends and family; and his all-consuming  self-centeredness.<br /><br />Interwoven with Vann's biography is a brilliant  survey of the Vietnam conflict from the time of the French defeat at  Dienbienphu in 1954 to Vann's death in 1972. Three areas of this book were  especially interesting to me: first, the author's account of the battle of  Ap Bac in 1963, where American advisors were first seriously bloodied by  the Vietcong, and Vann's attitudes about the overall conduct of the war  took shape; second, Vann's efforts, after his retirement from the Army, to  get the U.S. government to change its Vietnam policy - and the political  machinations within the government at work against him; and third, Vann's  last months in Vietnam as the \\"civilian general\\" in charge of the  mountains of the highlands and the rice deltas of the central coast, and  the critical role he played in several key battles as America's involvement  in Southeast Asia approached its tragic coda.<br /><br />\\"A Bright Shining  Lie\\" is certainly one of the two best single-volume histories (along  with \\"Vietnam: A History\\" by Stanley Karnow) of America's  involvement in Vietnam that I've read.

Author Carl Van Doren  presents a rich and detailed portrait of Franklin - printer, writer,  philosopher, scientist, inventor, politician, statesman, and one of the  founding fathers of the United States of America.<br /><br />By tracing the major  influences on Franklin,  and the key events of his life, Van Doren presents  this self-educated genius as the apotheosis of the 18th century  \\"Enlightened\\" man.  Imbued with an insatiable intellectual  appetite, a keen scientific mind, a high sense of morality, and a fervent  patriotism, he was shrewd, wise, witty, and always confident in his own  limitless abilities.  The author describes in detail the great events of  Franklin's life - his youth and young adulthood as a printer and writer of  Poor Richard's Almamack; the philosopher, scientist and inventor of note;  Postmaster General for Pennsylvania, and later for all the colonies;  representative of the American colonies to Great Britain at the time of the  American Revolution; signer of the Declaration of Independence; U.S.  Ambassador to France after the Revolution; and signer of the U.S.  Constitution.<br /><br />As good a biography as this is, \\"Benjamin  Franklin\\" is also outstanding history. Van Doren skillfully  \\"paints\\" Franklin's portrait against the backdrop of the  tremendous social ferment, scientific awakening, and tumultuous political  events which occurred during the second half of the 18th century.  I gained  not only a fuller understanding of  Franklin's life and great genius, but  also a greater appreciation of  the times in which he  lived.<br /><br />\\"Benjamin Franklin\\" is written with grace, clarity and  obviously great scholarship.

MacArthur has been praised for his brilliant strategic and tactical  abilities during both world wars and accomplishments as Military Governor  in post-World War II Japan, and criticized for his overweening egoism and  inability to subordinate himself to the wishes of his civilian  superiors.<br /><br />William Manchester writes with wit and candor as he chronicles  MacArthur's life from his earliest days to his death in 1964, at age 84.  Manchester's portrait of his subject is balanced and objective.  We see  MacArthur at his finest:  capable and courageous on the battlefield during  World War I, rising quickly to general officer rank as a result of his  abilities;  between the world wars, a progressive, reform-minded  superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, and later U.S. Army Chief of  Staff;  during World War II, a recipient of the Medal of Honor, and the gifted but  overly vainglorious commander of all Allied forces in the South Pacific,  who achieved brilliant military successes with his  &#34;island-hopping&#34; strategy; and later, as Military Governor of  Japan, displaying a surprising magnanimity toward the conquered Japanese by  introducing American-style democracy and liberal reforms.  We also see him  at his worst: pompous and vain, always seeking personal glory, often at his  subordinates' expense; vindictive toward his subordinates when they  disagreed with him; and finally, during the Korean War, the Supreme  Commander whose hubris led him to openly defy his commander-in-chief,  resulting in his relief by President Harry Truman.<br /><br />&#34;American  Caesar&#34; clearly shows why William Manchester is one of the pre-eminent  biographers at work today. The book is written with obviously meticulous  scholarship, insightful analysis, and crisp, sparkling prose.  It stands  alongside fellow biographer D.

The author, the late Alice Rains Trulock, presents a  well researched, meticulously documented, and detailed portrait of this  brilliant and courageous man.<br /><br />Trulock traces  Chamberlain's early life and  career - first, as a student, and later as Professor of Rhetoric (and other  subjects) at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.  Chamberlain's military  career  - his rise from command of the 20th Maine to general officer rank  in the Union army, and his outstanding leadership and valor during some of  the fiercest and bloodiest battles of the Civil War, including  Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Petersburg, and Five Forks - is then chronicled  with some of Trulock's  liveliest and most exciting  prose.  (Chamberlain,  of course,  is best known for his actions as Colonel of the 20th Maine  Volunteers at the Battle of Gettysburg. Here Trulock describes in detail  the events of July 2, 1863, when  he led his 380-man regiment in its  successful defense of Little Round Top, thereby saving the Union army from  a crushing defeat, and ensuring his own place in the pantheon of American  military heroes.)  Trulock  also details Chamberlain's post-Civil War  career as Governor of Maine (1867-1871); President of Bowdoin College  (1871-1883); and unsuccessful businessman.<br /><br />In addition to providing  obviously well researched and superbly written descriptions of  Chamberlain's military, political and business accomplishments, \\"In  the Hands of Providence\\" also gives the reader a balanced and  objective look at Chamberlain's personal life.<br /><br />Especially enjoyable and  informative are the descriptions of his relationships with his wife Fannie;  his daughter Grace and son Harold Wyllys; and his brother Tom.  The author  does a wonderful job of allowing the reader to get to know Chamberlain the  warm hearted and loving family man, as well as Chamberlain the patriot,  scholar, college professor and president, military hero, and Governor of  Maine.<br /><br />\\"In the Hands of Providence\\"  is the best modern  biography of one of the most extraordinary and gifted Americans of the  nineteenth century.

He won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his courageous leadership of the 20th Maine Volunteer Regiment at the Battle of  Gettysburg in 1863, thereby ensuring his place in history. \\"Soul of  the Lion,\\" by Willard M. Wallace, is a well written biography of  Chamberlain.  With clear and lively prose, Wallace chronicles Chamberlain's  early life and career as a professor at Bowdoin College; his  rise from  command of the 20th Maine to general officer rank in the Union army; and  his unfailingly  heroic performance in some of the bloodiest  battles of  the Civil War, including Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Petersburg, and Five  Forks.<br /><br />Wallace also details Chamberlain's post-Civil War career as  Governor of Maine (1867-1871); President of Bowdoin College (1871-1883);  and unsuccessful businessman.  Especially interesting was how Chamberlain,  as commander of Maine's militia,  saved the state from violent anarchy  during the 1880 gubernatorial election.<br /><br />Despite  being well written,  \\"Soul of the Lion\\" doesn't quite approach the depth found in the  best biographies of military leaders.  I would have especially appreciated  more detailed information concerning Chamberlain's relationships with his  family members.  This is only a minor reservation, however; \\"Soul of  the Lion\\" is a good basic survey of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain's  life, and a highly recommendable book about one of the great Americans of  the 19th century.	2000-06-19

Author Stephen B. Oates interweaves imaginary first-person written accounts of  eleven of the war's  key figures - among them Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson  Davis, U.S. Grant, Robert E. Lee, William T. Sherman,  Mary Boykin Chesnut  and Mary Livermore - to present the story of America's most tragic war a  dramatic and compelling way.<br /><br />Although the first-person soliloquies are  fictional, they are based on obviously extensive and meticulous research,  and are filled with historical facts which are detailed and accurate.  Actually,  Oates adds little in the way of new historical data or  interpretation in this book, although the new information on John Wilkes  Booth, and the descriptions of the Northern hospital camps by Cornelia  Hancock  make compelling reading.<br /><br />What I found most fascinating about  \\"The Whirlwind of War\\" was how effectively Oates was able to  bring the characters' personalities so much to life in their soliloquies.  Oates doesn't pretend to try to write in the style of Lincoln, Davis,  Grant, or the others; still, he allows their personalities to shine through  completely.  I felt I really got to know the tormented Abraham Lincoln, the  laconic U.S. Grant, the profane, manic-depressive William T. Sherman, the  reserved and dignified Robert E. Lee, and the bitter Jefferson Davis  through their first-person accounts.<br /><br />Oates' imaginative writing in  \\"The Whirlwind of War\\" makes it an especially entertaining book,  one which gives readers an accurate and reasonably detailed understanding  of the people and events which made up America's bloodiest conflict.  Highly recommended.	2000-06-11

With his book \\"October 1964,\\" author David Halberstam once again proves himself an exceptionally talented sportswriter, as well as a superb historian and journalist.  Written in the same vein as \\"The Summer of  '49,\\" his 1989 book on baseball, \\"October 1964\\" tells the  story of the last season of the great New York Yankee dynasty of the 1950s  and 60s, the St. Louis Cardinals' 1964 championship season, and the  climactic seven-game 1964 Yankees-Cardinals World Series.<br /><br />This is much  more than a straightforward account of a baseball season and World Series.  Halberstam, a writer well known for books combining excellent history with  insightful social commentary, (\\"The Best and the Brightest,\\"  \\"The Fifties,\\" \\"The Children,\\" among them,) delivers a  well researched historical narrative and an incisive analysis of  both the  Yankees' and Cardinals' 1964 seasons and players, set against the backdrop  of ongoing social ferment in the United States of the 1960s.  The reader is  introduced to a Yankees team of aging white superstars - Mickey Mantle,  Roger Maris and Whitey Ford among them - a team living on past glories and  hoping to keep its dynasty alive.  The St. Louis Cardinals, by contrast,  was a team made up of young and predominantly black players - Bob Gibson,  Lou Brock, and Curt Flood (who would one day help change the face of  baseball) - bringing new levels of speed and power to the game, and rising  to dominance in the National League.  Halberstam eloquently interweaves a  narrative of  each team's season  with the story of  the black players'  struggle against prejudice,  at the  time the Civil Rights movement in the  United States was gaining momentum.  The culmination of this book is  Halberstam's description of how the 1964 World Series was played, won and  lost, and some of the surprising turns of events  in the aftermath of the  World Series.<br /><br />\\"October 1964\\" is simply an excellent read -  highly entertaining,  fast paced, witty, anecdotal, and authoritative.  Lovers of baseball, and those who know nothing about the game, will enjoy  this book.  Highly recommended!cdotal, and authoritative.

I read it after my 11-year old son suggested it as a change from my usual reading fare of history and biography.  It turned out to be much more than just a springtime reading diversion...it became  for me a \\"magical\\" reading experience in more ways than one.  I  was quickly captivated by Harry, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Hermoine, and yes,  even the nasty Dursleys, Snape, and Draco Mafoy.<br /><br />Hogwarts came to life for  me.  I found myself unable to put the book down because it was so exciting  and much fun to read!  It's easy to understand why my son (and so many kids  just like him) love Harry Potter so much.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling proves herself a  gifted writer of children's books, not only because the plot is good and  the characters come to life, but also because her writing fires the  imagination and teaches positive values.<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter and the  Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a great book for kids of all ages...from 9 to 99.

From the unexpected triumph of  President Harry Truman over  Republican challenger Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 election,  to the coming  to power of Kennedy, Khruschev, and Castro at the end of the decade, the  reader is witness to the historical and social upheaval of the 1950s:  the  Korean War, and Truman's controversial firing of General Douglas MacArthur;  the rise of  Senator Joseph McCarthy and  his virulent anti-communist  crusade which came to be known as McCarthyism; Alger Hiss, Whittaker  Chambers, Richard Nixon,  and the House Un-American Activities Committee;  the dawn of the space age and America's race for space with the USSR;  the  anti-establishment movement, personified by Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg,  and the &quot;Beats;&quot; the establishment of such American institutions  as McDonald's, Holiday Inn, and  birth control;  the coming of rock `n roll  and Elvis Presley, Charles Van Doren and the TV quiz show scandals;  and  many others.  Halberstam paints an extraordinarily detailed and colorful  portrait of the middle decade of the 20th century, and explains why it was  so pivotal to the way our American culture has developed since.  This is a  fascinating and highly entertaining book, one which I think is Halberstam's  best.  Highly recommended!	2000-05-21

It's reasonably well written,  chronicling Sheridan's early life, his attendance at West Point, and his  meteoric rise to general officer rank in the early days of the Civil War.  Author Roy Morris, Jr. also details Sheridan's post-Civil War military  career as an unsuccessful military governor of Louisiana, an Indian fighter  in the midwest, and ultimately as General-in-Chief of the U.S. Army.  Especially interesting was Sheridan's relationship with George Armstrong  Custer, which Morris traces from their days fighting together during the  Civil War, to the time of Custer's death at Little Big Horn.<br /><br />I did find a  problem with this book, despite its  being fairly well written.  While it  provided some reasonably detailed information on Sheridan's life, times and  personality, I didn't feel that it approached depth  found in the best  biographies of military leaders.  When I finished \\"Sheridan,\\" I  felt I hadn't really been introduced to the man;  I almost got the feeling  Morris left out  information in order to keep down the length of the book  (which runs only to 393 pages.)<br /><br />\\"Sheridan\\" is a good basic  survey of one of the great U.S. Army generals of the 19th century, but it's  not a particularly penetrating study of  General Philip Sheridan's life and  times.  In my view, Phil Sheridan deserves better.	2000-05-21

Sir Winston Spencer Churchill, one of the greatest statesmen of the 20th century, and probably one of the greatest men in history, lived a long, rich and controversial life.  Martin Gilbert is his official biographer.  &quot;Churchill: A Life&quot; is based upon Gilbert's much larger  multi-volume biography, but it is not an abridgment.<br /><br />Gilbert tells  Churchill's story in an elegant and  straightforward manner.  He moves the  reader smoothly from Churchill's troubled childhood, through his brief  military career and into his long career as a Member of Parliament.  Churchill's rapid rise from House of Commons  &quot;back-bencher,&quot; to  cabinet minister was  phenomenal.  So were his numerous falls from power,  caused mainly by his uncanny ability to alienate nearly all his political  colleagues.  After eight  years in the &quot;political wilderness,&quot;  Churchill reached the pinnacle of British political power, becoming Prime  Minister in May 1940, just as Nazi Germany launched its attack on the Low  Countries and France.  Gilbert's treatment of Churchill's wartime and  post-war premierships is fascinating, as is his narrative of Churchill's  later years.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, although I felt I didn't get  to know Churchill as well as I did after reading William Manchester's  two-volume Churchill biography, &quot;The Last Lion.&quot;  Gilbert's  prose is much more scholarly sounding, and lacks some of Manchester's flair for dramatic storytelling, and his incisive commentary. Still, &quot;Churchill: A Life&quot; is a  fascinating, if not especially penetrating, study of this colossus of  British history.

Marshall's narrative is crisp and precise, and his  descriptions of people and events is reasonably detailed.  He is fair and  objective, unsparing in his criticism of errors made my military leaders on  all sides of the conflict.  Perhaps the strongest part of this book is the  opening chapters,  where Marshall narrates a fascinating account of the  underlying causes of the war and the events of conflict's first few months.<br /><br />This book won't take the reader into any deep examination of the war,  its causes, or its effects on later events.  It is, however, a good basic  survey of the war,  based upon solid, if not penetrating, research.  It  certainly makes recommendable reading.	2000-05-08

This is a wonderful fictionalized account of the battle of Gettysburg, told from the perspective of many of those principally  responsible for fighting it.  Author Michael Shaara based his characters on the actual  historical figures themselves, and it's obvious that he took great pains to  present his characters with historical accuracy.  I really felt I got to  know men like Joshua Chamberlain, Robert E. Lee, John Buford,  and James  Longstreet.  The same is true for his descriptions of combat:  they are  vigorous, colorful, tough, gritty and realistic.  I could almost smell the  gunpowder and hear the musketry as I read along.  For me, the book's  greatest strength was the powerful way it conveyed the tragedy of war in  general, and of the Civil War in particular.  &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;  is certainly the best Civil War novel I've ever read, and maybe the best  novel about the war between the states ever written.	2000-05-07

Very seldom do I find myself unable to finish a book I've started, especially when its subject is as interesting to me as George Washington.  Simply put, &quot;George Washington: A Life&quot; is a poorly written  biography of our greatest American - so bad, in fact, that I found myself  putting the book down after I had read only about half of it.  Problems  abounded for me:  I believe the best biographies allow the reader to gain a  deeper understanding of the life and times of the person being written  about;  I never felt I was properly introduced to Washington or his times  (and I am aware of the difficulties that even the best Washington  biographers have had in understanding this enigmatic man.)  Sterne's  writing style is often confusing.  In some places, the author aroused  my  interest with an interesting fact or anecdote, then left me hanging with an  incomplete description of the event.  In other areas, he used a highly  sensational language and several pages to describe events which should have  taken a paragraph at best.  It also seems to me that this book doesn't  really show a depth of scholarly research.  Being neither an academic nor a  professional historian, I can't verify the accuracy of all Sterne's facts  and interpretations, but a comparison of this book with  &quot;Washington,&quot; the one volume abridgement of  Douglas Freeman  Southall's 7-volume Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of our first  President, left me with the impression that Sterne really doesn't fully  understand his subject.<br />My advice:  if you want a good one-volume  biography of George Washington, one that employs an excellent writing style  and solid scholarship, look elsewhere.  (I recommend the Freeman book cited  above.)  &quot;George Washington: A Life&quot; simply doesn't deliver.	2000-05-07

In his excellent biography of Brooklyn Dodgers infielder Jackie Robinson,  author Arnold Rampersad has painted with a crisp and  lively narrative an objective, balanced , and candid portrait of  a legend.  Here is seen the  complex, driven man that was Jackie Robinson, &#34;warts&#34; and all.  He was the proud and fiercely determined African American athlete,  extraordinarily gifted in at least four sports;  a sometimes overly  sensitive man who despised racism always fought against it, even in the  pre-Civil Rights era of the 1930s and 1940s, and even at the risk of  conviction by military court-martial. He used an  unconquerable will and  ambition to became a football, baseball, basketball and track  star at  Pasadena Junior College;  one of the greatest football running backs in  UCLA history,  and ultimately,  under the guidance of legendary Brooklyn  Dodgers General Manager Branch Rickey, the first African American  professional baseball player of the modern era.  Rampersad traces  Robinson's struggle against racism during his early Dodger years; it is a  poignant and compelling story.<br /><br />The book also shows the more human side  of Robinson:  a quiet and sensitive man, and a political activist whose  fight for racial equality was consistent throughout his life; a wonderfully  loving husband but sometimes distant father; and a businessman of  tremendous integrity. At  Rampersad's  hands, Jackie Robinson  is a  genuinely heroic and admirable person. This is a book which allows the  reader to really get to know its subject.  It is one of the finest  biographies I've read in many years.  Highly recommended!	2000-05-07

Schonberg, it was the second edition, published  1n 1981.  That edition probably did more than any other on the subject of classical music to turn  my casual interest in this musical genre into a genuine passion.  So, when  I recently saw a copy of the third edition in my local bookstore, I eagerly  bought it.  It's still a very well written book,  made up of short  biographies of those composers whom Schonberg considers the greatest or  most influential of their times. It's an invaluable aid for readers  interested in learning more about classical music and the great creative  geniuses who composed it.  The biographical essays are written with wit and  eloquence.  (I found myself really liking Joseph Haydn the man, and gaining  a greater appreciation for his music as well.)  The author's prose is  clear, concise, easily understood, and written for (in his words) \\"the  intelligent, music-loving lay audience.\\"  He avoids technical jargon,  which is commendable.<br /><br />However, to my disappointment, the third edition  is not as good as its predecessor.  Many of what the author considers  \\"improvements\\" in the Third Edition actually detracted from its  usefulness to me.  For example, in the second edition, Schonberg provided  short sections which explained the different musical periods - (i.e.,  Baroque, Classical, Romantic.)  These were eliminated in the third edition,  even though they're probably invaluable teaching tools for non-academic,  non-musicologists like myself.  I also found myself wondering about how  the author selected composers for inclusion in the new edition.  For  example, I understand why he included Claudio Monteverdi, whose music has  recently entered the performing repertory,  but why does he exclude Antonio  Vivaldi, especially  when his music has remained in the performing  repertory for nearly three centuries?<br /><br />Having said all this, \\"The  Lives of the Great Composers\\"  is still an excellent book, and a  worthy companion to Jan Swafford's \\"Vintage Guide to Classical  Music.\\"  Both should be on every classical music lovers' bookshelf.ers\\"  is still an excellent book, and a  worthy companion to Jan Swafford's \\"Vintage Guide to Classical  Music.\\"  Both should be on every classical music lovers' bookshelf.	2000-05-06

Francis Parkman is considered by many scholars to be the greatest American historian ever.  This book is his masterpiece, written in 1884 as the  final volume of his multi-volume work &#34;France and England in North  America.&#34;  It  tells the story of the Seven Years' War (also known as the French and Indian War), which is  probably the most historically decisive war ever fought on the North  American continent.<br /><br />Parkman writes with precision, eloquence, and  objectivity.  With his vivid and fast paced narrative, he demonstrates a  wonderful flair dramatizing history.  At the same time, his tremendous  knowledge about this vast and complex subject is evident on every page.  For me, the most fascinating parts of this book were the chapters which  described  the conflict for Acadia, and the ultimate forced evacuation of  the Acadians by the British; Braddock's defeat; and the battles of  Louisbourg and Quebec. Parkman's descriptions of these key events, and the  personalities behind them, make them seem to come alive.<br /><br />Parkman writes  in the romantic style popular in the late nineteenth century; yet, his  prose is of such high quality that it never seems dated.  In fact, as I was  reading, I found it difficult to remember that &#34;Montcalm and  Wolfe&#34; was written over a century ago! This book, which  is already a timeless classic,  is essential reading for those interested  in the Seven Years' War. Most highly recommended.	2000-05-05

This volume covers the eight-year period from the beginning of  Churchill's longest period in the political \\"wilderness,\\" to his  rise to power as Prime Minister of Great Britain at the beginning of World  War II.  I think this book  is even better than the first volume,  \\"The Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932.\\"  Manchester  contends that the inter-war  years, and not his years as Prime Minister,  were Churchill's personal \\"finest hour.\\"  Politically ostracized  by two successive Prime Ministers - Stanley Baldwin and Neville  Chamberlain, the main architects of Britain's policy of appeasing Nazi  Germany - Churchill was one of only a handful of men in Britain  to speak  out in favor of increased military preparedness as a means of  countering  the growing Nazi threat in Europe.  Only when it became obvious in the late  1930s that the appeasement of Hitler had failed, did the British nation  turn to the one man who had consistently advocated standing up to the Nazi  dictator:  Winston Spencer Churchill<br /><br />As he did in the first volume of  Churchill's life,  Manchester provides an insightful historical overview of  the times in which Churchill lived. Especially fascinating to me was the  account of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's 1938 trip to Munich, where  the most infamous act of appeasing Hitler - the  sellout of Czechoslovakia  - took place, and where Chamberlain believed he had achieved \\"peace in  our times.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940\\" once again  clearly demonstrates why William Manchester is one of the pre-eminent  biographers at work today.

I found it a superbly crafted, supremely well researched  account of the first 58 years of the life of the 20th century's greatest  statesman.  With wit and candor,  Manchester chronicles Churchill from his  earliest days as the neglected and troublesome first child of Lord Randolph  Churchill and his American-born wife, Jennie, to his entry into the  political \\"wilderness\\" over home rule in India in 1932.  Manchester's portrait of his subject is balanced and objective;  we see  Churchill at his finest: a courageous (almost to the point of  foolhardiness) army officer, and later a gifted Member of Parliament who  became one of the youngest Cabinet ministers in British history.  We also  see him at his worst:  a Cabinet minister with appalling political judgment  at times, quick to meddle in other ministers' affairs while neglecting his  own, and with an uncanny ability to alienate not only his political foes,  but almost all his political allies as well.<br /><br /> In addition to a  wonderfully written chronology of Churchill's life, Manchester provides an  overview of  the times in which Churchill lived.  I was fascinated by the  author's account of Victorian England -- its culture, its mores, and its  view of itself in the world. The sections which describe Churchill's times  make highly entertaining and absorbing reading by themselves.<br /><br />\\"The  Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932,\\"  clearly shows why William  Manchester is one of the pre-eminent biographers at work today.  The book  is written with obviously meticulous scholarship, insightful analysis, and  crisp,  sparkling prose;  I have yet to find a  better account of  Churchill's life.<br /><br />Since the publication of \\"The Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932\\" 30 years ago, several excellent books about Winston Churchill have been written, including \\"Warlord\\" by Carlo d'Este (2008) and \\"Winston's War\\" by Max Hastings (2011). As good as these works are (and they are very good indeed), William Manchester's \\"The Last Lion\\" remains the finest multi-volume biography of Churchill available today. It is a \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in the life of Winston Churchill; Highly recommended!<br /><br />AFTERWORD:  William Manchester died in 2004 before he could complete the third and final volume of his great triptych on the life of Winston Churchill. Manchester had apparently completed well over one-half of the manuscript for his final  volume, which he had tentatively entitled \\"The Last Lion: Defender of the Realm 1940-1965.\\" He had selected Paul Reid, an excellent writer and close friend, to carry on and complete his work after his death.

For me, neither an academic nor a musicologist, this is the case with Maynard Solomon's \\"Beethoven.\\" When I first read it two tears ago, I saw it as \\"the best Beethoven biography I ever read...combining excellent writing, complete objectivity, and outstanding scholarship...maybe the best Beethoven biography ever.\\" Now that I've read it again, (after also reading additional material Beethoven's life from other sources,) my opinion has changed.  This time I found his attempts to psychoanalyze Beethoven annoying, and seemingly rooted more in conjecture rather than solid facts. Even the chapter on the Immortal Beloved, which I found so impressive the first time I read the book, seems now to me based more upon a process of elimination rather than solid scholarship.<br /><br />Professor Solomon's prose is lively and entertaining, and his musical commentary may help non-academics and non-musicologists like myself better understand Beethoven's work. However, readers like myself, with a strong interest in Beethoven's life and music, may find other biographies that will better meet their needs.	2000-04-29

Certainly not much can be added  to the accolades already given  to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\"  the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel which has become a classic of modern American literature. This is the powerfully  told story of a family's struggle for justice in a small Alabama town in  the 1930s, written from the perspective of  the  young daughter of a lawyer  defending a black man charged with the rape of a white girl.  With wit and  honesty, the book examines the racial and class attitudes prevalent in the  Deep South in the years leading up to the Civil Rights era.<br /><br />I recently  finished reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\"  for only the second  time (the first was in  1963, when I was 12 years old.)  I  found it to be  just as wonderful a reading experience 37 years later!  The characters and  the setting come to life like no other novel I've ever read.  The book made  me laugh some, cry some, and get angry some.  But, the most important thing  it did for me was to make me evaluate once again my own attitudes and  actions toward other people.

It is rich and detailed, and obviously very well researched. By tracing all the major influences on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - among them his father Leopold and sister Nannerl; his wife Constanze; Count Hieronymous Colloredo, the Archbishop of Salzburg (his infamous bete noir,) and Austrian Emperor Joseph II - author Robert Gutman presents Mozart in a far different light than the loud, immature and vulgar individual depicted in earlier biographies, and in the film \\"Amadeus.\\"<br /><br />Gutman's graceful and eloquent pen instead presents Mozart as always confident in his own limitless abilities. Although late to maturity due to his father's domineering ways, he was completely competent to manage his own affairs once he achieved independence from the court of the Archbishop of Salzburg. (Contrary to the popular belief he died a pauper, Mozart actually had achieved a limited measure of financial security at the time of his death.)  Imbued with a strong sense of high morality and a wonderfully self-deprecating sense of humor, he could be at times cheerful, witty, optimistic, and wise beyond his years; at other times, petulant, immature, tactless and crude.<br /><br />As good a biography as this is, \\"Mozart: A Cultural Biography\\" is also outstanding history. Adhering to the belief of fellow biographer William Manchester that \\"there can be no enlightening life which does not include an account of the man's times,\\" Gutman skillfully interweaves a short course on European political and social history with the events of Mozart's life. Several chapters near the beginning of the book explore the ongoing political and cultural ferment during Mozart's formative years, and how these environmental factors influenced Mozart's musical style. Gutman's commentary on the many musical forms in which Mozart excelled - especially opera - were especially helpful to me in more fully understanding Mozart's life, times and great genius.<br /><br />\\"Mozart: A Cultural Biography\\" is written with grace, clarity and obviously great scholarship. Its one drawback is that the author seems to assume in readers a reasonably good knowledge of 18th century European history, and of classical music. Despite this minor shortcoming, \\"Mozart: A Cultural Biography, \\" is certainly the best of the three biographies of Mozart I've read.

Ketchum on major battles of the American Revolution. Using letters and other first-hand accounts from both American and British sources, Ketchum  skillfully, impartially,  and with great detail narrates the events which  occurred in upstate New York during the spring, summer and autumn of 1777.  These included the early British victories at Fort Ticonderoga and  Hubbardton; the later American victories at Bennington and Freeman's Farm;  and the surrender of all British forces by their commander, Lieutenant  General John Burgoyne, at Saratoga, New York, on  October 17, 1777.<br /><br />For  me, this was a fairly well written account of the battle commonly described  as \\"the turning point of the American Revolution.\\"  Ketchum's  descriptions of the various personalities and battles are vivid and  colorful, and almost transported me to the battlefield.  However,  \\"Saratoga\\" is not as good as his earlier works  \\"Decisive  Day\\" and \\"The Winter Soldiers.\\"  The pace of the narrative  is slower, especially at the beginning. Here Ketchum  seems to go into too  much detail setting the stage for battles to come.  (For instance, I kept  wondering why so many pages were devoted to the author's description of  the Franklin-Carroll  mission to persuade Canada to join the rebellion.)  \\"Saratoga\\" could also have benefited from more maps and  illustrations of better quality. These are, however, relatively minor  reservations about an overall excellent book, one which I heartily  recommend to anyone seeking a greater understanding of one of the most  important battles ever fought on North American soil.	2000-03-12

A Rich and balanced portrait of a great leader.	&quot;Patton&quot; A Genius for War &quot; is an outstanding biography of General George S. Patton.  After seeing some less than glowing critical reviews of this book, I was hesitant to read it, expecting it to be  over-long, somewhat disjointed and unorganized.  But, I plunged ahead  anyway, and  found the book to be a genuinely pleasant surprise - superbly  written, richly detailed,  balanced, and obviously well researched and  organized. The portrait of Patton which emerges is that of a man destined  for greatness on the field of battle from the beginning.  Here is seen the  scion of a Virginia family steeped in military tradition since the Civil  War (two ancestors died as heroes to the Confederacy during that conflict).  Here is the young man with a tremendous intellect and drive to succeed;  suffering from, and successfully compensating for, dyslexia and feelings of  inadequacy brought on by this disability.  And, here is the army officer  who believed he was destined for greatness, demonstrating a natural genius  for war throughout his long military career;  a  highly  patriotic, proud,  and  profane general, capable of quickly moving an entire army across  Europe;  yet afflicted with the hubris which ultimately  led to his firing  as Third Army commander at the end of World War II.  &quot;Patton: A  Genius of War&quot;  is a wonderful biography of a highly complex and yet  deeply flawed man.  For readers interested in getting beyond the image of  Patton presented by the movie, this book is a must read.	2000-03-10

Ketchum.  I found it a compelling and often moving story of the darkest hours in America's war for independence, and the two battles - Trenton and Princeton - which reversed  the American army's increasingly bleak fortunes in the second winter of the  war.<br /><br />Ketchum traces the war's pivotal events in 1776 and early 1777.  This is the time when General George Washington leads his dwindling army in  a desperate attempt to hold off British advances in and around New York  City;  of the great American defeats at Long Island, and Forts Lee and  Washington in New York;  and the pursuit of the American army across New  Jersey by the numerically superior and better equipped British army under  General William Howe and Lord Cornwallis.  It is also the time when the  strategic and tactical skills, the iron will, and the sheer audacity of  George Washington come to the forefront, resulting in the American army's  crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night 1776,  and, against all  odds, the astonishing American victories at Trenton and Princeton,  New  Jersey.<br /><br />As he did in his earlier book  \\"Decisive Day,\\" the  author combines outstanding scholarship and a clear and concise writing  style to create a powerful and often eloquent narrative of the events of  1776-1777.  For readers of American history, this is a book not to be  missed.	2000-03-04

I've read \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\\" several times now  (I've also taken the \\"Seven Habits\\" management course),  and the book's powerful message never ceases to have a positive effect on nearly every aspect of my life.<br /><br />This is a book about  organizational excellence, but with a key difference than most others on  the same subject:  Covey believes that the foundation of organizational  excellence is personal excellence.  The seven habits he describes in great  detail are tools leading to that goal.  They can be applied  in nearly  every situation in our lives, and, if successfully practiced, will help us  to improve our lives at home, work and play.  A word of caution, though:  the book may not be for everybody;  you have to be willing to face yourself  honestly and courageously, and apply the seven habits daily, in order to  become more effective.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"The Seven Habits of  Highly Effective People\\" is well written.  Covey tends to  \\"sermonize\\" in places, and his writing style is at times  long-winded and a bit patronizing (a flaw common to many writers of  management books who think of theirs as the \\"best way\\").  However, despite its stylistic shortcomings, the book's message is powerful  and profound...for those who have the courage to accept it and put it into  practice.	2000-03-04

This is a beautifully written book, the first of three written so far by Richard Ketchum, on famous Revolutionary War battles.  It  tells the story of the first major military engagement of the American  Revolution as does no other book I've ever read on the same subject.<br /><br />The author brings to  life the main characters and events of the story.  He  briefly  introduces  the major  figures - British  Generals Thomas Gage and William Howe, and  American leaders Joseph Warren,  General Israel Putnam, Colonel William  Prescott, and Henry Knox - and traces the story of the conflict in the  Boston area in the spring of 1775.  Ketchum then sets the scene of the  battle by  describing how the Americans, chronically short of munitions,  supplies and manpower, successfully avoided British detection and  entrenched themselves on Breed's Hill (mistaking it for  the higher Bunker  Hill), and how the British reacted once they discovered the fortifications.  Drawing on letters and other first-person accounts of the battle's  participants and observers, both the American and British,  Ketchum  vividly describes the military action of June 17, 1775;  I found myself  almost able to hear the firing of guns, and smell the smoke of battle, as I  read the final chapters of the book.<br /><br />As an avid reader of American  History, I thought I knew everything about  battle of Bunker Hill;  however, Ketchum's powerfully written narrative introduced me to many new  facts about the people and events of this, the first major battle in  America's war for independence.  It is a book of outstanding scholarship,  and  \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in American history.	2000-03-04

Writing in the clear and lucid style for which he is noted, historian David  McCullough traces the creation of the Panama Canal from its earliest  inception by the French in 1870,  to its completion 44 years later by the  United States.<br /><br />McCullough skillfully weaves personalities and events  together to create a powerful narrative replete with political intrigue,  financial scandal, and triumph over tremendous adversity.  The author  first acquaints the reader with the leaders of the French attempt to build  the canal - Ferdinand de Lesseps and his son,  Charles, and Phillippe  Bunau-Varilla, among others - and tells of  the ultimate failure of their  venture, and their disgrace due to financial scandal.  McCullough then  chronicles the ultimately  successful American attempt to build the canal.<br /><br />Here is seen the political intrigue (the U.S. backed Panamanian revolution  against Colombia, with the complicity of President Theodore Roosevelt,  Secretary of State John Hay, and Bunau-Varilla);  the successful war  against yellow fever and malaria, led by American doctor William Gorgas;  and the organizational and engineering genius of two American Chief  Engineers - John Stevens and Colonel George Goethals - which led to the  completion of the canal in 1914.<br /><br />\\"The Path Between the Seas\\"  is more than just the story of how the Panama Canal was built; it is a well  researched, historically accurate, and  at the same time lively and highly  entertaining account of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

David McCullough's  Pulitzer Prize winning biography \\"Truman\\"  is undoubtedly the best Presidential biography I've read in recent years.  Written in a graceful and powerfully eloquent style, it is meticulously  researched, and accurately captures the essence of the man who was the 33rd  President of the United States.<br /><br />McCullough challenges a commonly held  view of history that Harry S Truman was nothing more than a common man of  mediocre abilities who became President almost by accident, and owed his  political success to his loyalty to the Democratic party and the Kansas  City political bosses.  By tracing the life of this self-made man  - a  farmer, artillery captain during World War I, haberdasher, local  politician, U.S. Senator, Vice President, and ultimately President of the  United States - the author acquaints the reader with a highly intelligent,  competent and complex man.<br /><br />Here is seen the highly principled politician  whose ability to judge the character of others enabled him to select  outstanding men like Dean Acheson and George Marshall to serve in his  administration;  a Chief Executive capable of making some of the most  momentous decisions of the twentieth century, such as ordering the use of  the atomic bomb against Japan in 1945, integrating the Armed Forces in  1948, and  firing General Douglas MacArthur in 1951.  But, here also is  seen a man who remained loyal to personal friends and Democratic party  bosses and tolerant of their often disreputable activities;  and who, in a  fit of petty anger, authored a threatening letter to a music critic who  wrote unfavorably about his daughter.<br /><br />\\"Truman\\" is above all  a fair and balanced portrait of one of the most unique and greatest of  American Presidents.  In my view, this extraordinarily well written book is  destined to be the biography of Harry S Truman against which all others  will be measured.  Highly recommended!	2000-03-01

A balanced portrait of a great leader	\\"General James Longstreet,  The Confederacy's Most Controversial Soldier: A Biography\\" is a candid,  fair and balanced  portrait of  a man who should, but doesn't, rank at the top of any list of the greatest  American military leaders.  James Longstreet's place in history has always  been shrouded in controversy, much of it of his own making.  In the decades  since the Civil War,  he has traditionally been blamed by historians for  the Confederate army's loss at Gettysburg, and condemned for his service in  the Grant administration as a traitor to the \\"Lost Cause.\\"<br /><br />Jeffry D. Wert's able pen (he writes in a very clear, concise and easily  comprehensible style) and obviously meticulous research presents Lee's  \\"old war-horse\\" as a general possessed with great strategic  vision, an outstanding ability to lead troops in the field, and with  tactically conservative, yet sound, instincts.  Longstreet's personal flaws  - his inability to control his emotions and support his superiors when he  disagreed with them, and his vindictiveness toward his subordinates when  they disagreed with him - are also fully explored.  The author's admiration  for his subject is evident throughout this book.  The overall portrait  that emerges is favorable - a general beloved by his troops and  depended  upon for his wise counsel and military skills by his boss, General Robert  E. Lee; but also a military leader capable of serious misjudgments both on  the field of battle, and in his dealings with both his superiors and  subordinates.<br /><br />This is one of the better biographies of one of the major  figures of the Civil War, and a book I enjoyed thoroughly.  I would have  preferred a bit more detail on Longstreet's life after the Civil War, but  that is my only (and very minor) reservation.  Highly recommended for all  Civil War enthusiasts!	2000-02-12

I agree with Tom Brokaw's  premise that the World War II generation may be the greatest in American history, and for the reasons he cites.  It is a pity that he doesn't follow through  with a book that really proves his argument.  What Brokaw  gives the reader  is a series of brief, fluffy  profiles of the lives of World War II  veterans from many walks of life.  These stories are interesting as far as  they go; unfortunately, Brokaw doesn't delve deep enough to support the  main contention of his book.<br /><br />Brokaw seems instead to have concentrated on  individual  achievements during the war (which were inarguably outstanding), but gave  relatively short shrift to his subjects'  postwar achievements (which to me  should have been the essential proof of Brokaw's overall  premise.  After  all, many  veterans who served in the decades since World War II have also  become community leaders, doctors, lawyers, engineers, and politicians; it  may be fairly argued that many of their achievements, while not yet fully  tested in the crucible of history, will prove as significant as those of  the generation Brokaw writes about).  I also was left questioning how  careful the author was in selecting the subjects about which he wrote.  It  seemed many of his selections were based on his own personal knowledge of  the people he chronicled.  Perhaps, with more research, he could have found  subjects  whose achievements after the war provided better support for his  argument.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I found the author's writing to be at  best average.  He writes very much like he speaks;  as a long-time viewer  of NBC Nightly News, I found myself almost able to hear Brokaw's voice as I  read along.<br /><br />\\"The Greatest Generation\\" is a book which I feel  has great potential left unfulfilled.  It could have been a towering  chronicle of the lives of some genuine American heroes, but falls short due  to obviously inadequate research and a lack of focus.  Its one major  redeeming feature is that it has made generations of Americans since World  War II understand better, and respect more, the people whose sacrifices  during the war really did change the second half of the twentieth century.

Alison Weir tells the story of the wars between the Houses of  Lancaster and York in 15th century England in a most compelling manner. She  allows the reader to get to know such disparate characters as the weak and  unstable usurper Lancastrian King Henry VI and his ambitious and ruthless  queen, Margaret of Anjou;  the Duke of York, who led the fight against the  Lancasters,  at first attempting to establish good government in England  under Henry VI, and later, with an eye toward taking the English throne for  himself;  and York's son, Edward, conscientious and competent, who, after  the Duke's death, picked up his father's fallen banner and deposed Henry  VI, becoming King Edward IV, and ultimately ending the Wars of the  Roses.<br /><br />Weir weaves personalities and a highly complex series of events  into a well organized, easily understandable and highly entertaining  narrative.

Here is seen the  complex, driven man that was Lombardi,  &#34;warts&#34; and all -- the  undersized and underrated lineman who, despite his admittedly limited  football skills, used his unconquerable will to became one of Fordham's  &#34;Seven Blocks of Granite&#34;;  the ambitious and brilliant assistant  coach, first for Army, and then for the New York Giants, always aware of  his prodigious coaching talents,  looking for twenty years to fulfill his  destiny as  a head coach; as Green Bay's head coach, the  tyrannical  taskmaster of the pro gridiron, gaining first fear, then grudging respect,  and finally love from those who played for him;  and the remote husband and  father, unable to make the investment of time and emotion in his wife, son  and daughter whom he loved.  At Maraniss' hands, Vince Lombardi is  sometimes easy to dislike, but always remains an admirable figure.  This is  a book which allows the reader to really get to know its subject.  It is  one of the finest biographies I've read in many years.  Highly  recommended!	1999-12-15

This book is drawn from the second volume of Shelby Foote's &#34;The Civil War: A Narrative History.&#34;  It is described on the book jacket as &#34;the central chapter of the central volume, and therefore the  capstone of the arch...&#34;<br /><br />Written with the powerful and eloquent  prose for which Shelby Foote is noted, &#34;Stars In Their Courses&#34;  vividly describes the events of the first three days of July 1863, in what  many historians consider the &#34;greatest battle in the history of the  Western Hemisphere.&#34;  The Battle of Gettysburg, in all its horror,  fairly leaps from the pages of this book at the hands of Shelby  Foote.<br /><br />&#34;Stars in Their Courses&#34; is not only a wonderful preview  of Foote's &#34;The Civil War: A Narrative History,&#34; trilogy, but it  also stands alone as one of the best accounts of the Battle of Gettysburg I  have found.  Highly recommended for any military history and Civil War  enthusiast!	1999-12-08

An indispensable tool for every office	I've long considered the World Almanac and Book of Facts to be the single most useful one-volume general reference book available for home and office.  The World Almanac and Book of Facts for 2000 is called the  &quot;Millennium Collector's Edition,&quot; and lives up to this billing  without the slightest trace of hype.  The hard cover edition is large, very  attractive, and filled not only with the usual collection of thoroughly  researched of facts, figures, and events past and present, but is also  enhanced with color photographs, maps, and special sections covering the  new millennium. Printed on high quality paper and in a slightly larger  print size than its paperback counterpart, it's very easy to use and makes  great browsing.  Highly recommended!	1999-12-03

No less an eminent man of letters than Mark Twain called Ulysses S. Grant's \\"Personal Memoirs\\" \\"the best [memoirs] of any General's than Caesars.\\"  Having now read this outstanding work along  with those of Julius Caesar, William T. Sherman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar  Bradley, Colin Powell and H. Norman Schwarzkopf, I must agree with Mark  Twain's assessment.  For sheer honesty, humility, and simple but powerful  language, U.S. Grant's memoirs are without peer.<br /><br />Grant allows the reader  to go along with him and live once again his experiences during the Mexican  War and American Civil War. He interjects his own judgments and opinions  sparingly, yet always honestly.  Where he feels he made mistakes, he admits  them freely, and his criticisms of his colleagues is always tempered by an  obvious attitude of professionalism.  The fact that Grant wrote a memoir of  such eloquence while dying from cancer makes it all the more powerful a  book.<br /><br />I found this modern library edition especially outstanding. The  introductory notes by Caleb Carr and Geoffrey Perret, while brief, are  extremely informative.  Maps and etchings from the original 1885 Charles  Webster & Co. edition are included, as is General Grant's report to  Secretary of War Stanton on Civil War operations during 1864-65. This  appendix makes fantastic reading by itself!<br /><br />I highly recommend this  outstanding edition to all Civil War and military history enthusiasts.  It  is simply the best military memoir I've ever read.	1999-12-02
US	50885600	R1390WX1XMQSJO	0399144935	33493017	Every Man a Tiger	Books	4	8	13	N	Y	Good book; but without  &quot;meat&quot;  in the Desert Storm section	&quot;Every Man a Tiger&quot; combines an historical account of the U.S. Air Force's role in the 1991 Persian Gulf conflict, with a memoir of Gen. Chuck Horner, the senior Air Force Commander in Desert Storm. I found the  section concerning Desert Storm lacking in interesting, substantive details  concerning the Air Force's role in winning that conflict.  It certainly was  less interesting than Gen. Horner's candid account of the Air Force from  the end of the Vietnam War to the present.  I was fascinated by how our  nation's political and military leadership allowed the Air Force to decline  in the 1970s, and how the leaders of the 1980s rebuilt the Air Force to the  world class military service it is today.  Overall, a recommendable book,  but certainly not as good as &quot;Into the Storm,&quot; Clancy's first  book in this series, with Gen. Fred Franks.	1999-11-25

A well written and accurate portrait of &quot;The Yard&quot;	Hard hats off to Michael Sanders for a magnificent book!  He has presented a thoroughly researched and extremely well written account of life inside Bath Iron Works.  In the space of only 236 pages, he manages to portray  just how difficult and dangerous an occupation shipbuilding is.(I know; I  currently work at Bath Iron Works and spent several months on the USS  Donald Cook.) I found the book to contain just the right combination of the  basics of ship design and construction, and a wonderful human interest  story.  I highly recommend this book to everyone!	1999-11-20
