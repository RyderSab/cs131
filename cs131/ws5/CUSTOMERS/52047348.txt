Watson's clear and perceptive review on the nature of smell takes readers into a world that is probably, for most of us, unexplored. But I encourage you to take Watson's journey about how we relate to each other and the animate world, and how it relates to itself-by smell, Watson says. The release or presence of pheromones may dictate our behavior more than we're cognizant of certainly more than we'd probably like to know. Our Jacobson's Organ, located at the top of our nostrils, often guides how we act, for better or worse, unconsciously or not. <BR><br /><BR>Imagine: a baby's head produces natural endorphins in those who smell it. Suddenly the behavior of parents around their newborn takes on a new perspective.<BR><br /><BR>I question the validity of Watson's view. It SEEMS plausible without knowing much about this field, but it sure was a quality read.	2002-04-08

Gall spells out the failings of, largely, cultural assumptions in the realms of education, food production, corporate culture and so on, in ways that are easy to understand despite complexities. Systemantics represents a collection rules and laws that characterize and define systems (from corporations, organizations, religions to families and other social groups), and Gall cites notable examples that have graced the headlines (from the mid-80s, in my edition). With humor and wit, Gall outlines potential and obvious pitfalls. Despite its age, this book is even more relevant today since much of what Gall elucidates is even more rampant than ever. Fans of Daniel Quinn (author of Ishmael, The Story of B, etc.) may find this appropriate to augment their interests.	2001-12-20

Azerrad tells it like it was for the mostly 80s punk scene, revisiting some of the heavyweights--Black Flag, Minor Threat, etc.--along with all the toil they faced as they paved the road for what many underground bands now take for granted: touring on shoestring budgets in the middle of nowhere USA, recording on a whim, making their own CDs and so forth. <br /> Azerrad makes it clear just who broke ground, and he does so with a high journalistic integrity: Hes intimate with each band member quoted but not so close as to refrain from documenting the many downsides exhibited by each punk band, from style changes to personality conflicts. He notes their humor too, and the lack thereof, as with Fugazi, a band that is notably into not having a good time, onstage or off. When the band wallows in excrement, like the Butthole Surfers did, Azerrad makes the reader feel as if he were caked in it right along with them. When SST rips off their bands, so too does the reader feel ripped off.<br />Which is why Azerrad should be commended in many regards. To even think about such a document raises many problems: which bands to focus on, who to interview (especially so long after the fact), whose side to lend more credence to when the opposition is so obviously befuddled and so on. Which bands deserve the print is always a thorny issue in the high-and-mighty underground punk scene. Stronger emphasis on this characteristically political decision deserves more attention in light of its sensitive nature. Scenes are made and destroyed this way, and ironically, Azerrads book in its own way contributes to this phenomenon even though, for many of the bands, it is well after the fact. American punks background is importantly documented in this book, even if its history is reconstructed ever so slightly.<br />It is therefore valid to question the inclusion of a band like Beat Happening when bands like 7 Seconds, Bikini Kill, Green Day or The Offspring (asa few obvious examples) could have provided other important perspectives on the emergence of independent punk into the mainstream. But any attempt at a document of this sort will face this issue, and Azerrad pulls it off with flying colors despite a few shortcomings. It is a luminous volume, and the band members sweat colorfully drips off of each page so much so that you forget that Azerrad himself probably sweat for years in order for you to relive it.	2001-09-12

Bit by bit, she hacks away at the roots of goddess-oriented philosophy to reveal a landscape fraught with fantasy, imagination and gobbledygook. Gender studies has a new era upon it, one that must, if taken seriously, heed Eller's accounting of the rise, and, should her book have any impact, demise of this seductive, female-dominated view of prehistory.<br />The goddess myth obviously serves a purpose. In the evolving social consciousness of civilized culture, portrayal of women in general leaves much to be desired. Simply, the female gender is clearly richer in different ways than men are, and women, because they biologically put their lives at risk in the reproductive process have a deeper kind of burden in serving life. But mainstream portrayals of women tend to disavow this organic aspect to femininity in favor of basically relegating them to being lesser than men. Patriarchy, in other words, is alive and well.<br />So the matriarchal projection into the prehistoric past is a perhaps all-too convenient redress for current grievances, Eller says, and thus, she takes to task the literature purporting a matriarchal dominated prehistory. New age fluff writers, archaeologists and anthropologists are treated to her critique, namely Marija Gimbutas, who dressed in different hats as both archaeologist and purveyor of distorted interpretations of the prehistoric past. Not surprisingly, according to Eller, the academic community never really took her seriously, not even enough to critique her work. <br />The same can't be said for the pseudo-scientific feminist community, however, that unquestioningly buys and sells the goddess-worship trip through today. Backed by what appears to be scientific evidence, the goddess mentality emerged not so much through academic journals and professional conferences, but rather tellingly in new age bookstores and on bumper stickers. A result: reified notions of matriarchal prehistory, that, when examining the basic premises, seem to exist rightfully where they emerge: in fantasyland. Fundamentally, though, Eller takes to task the very idea that just because inequitable gender relations exist today, that doesn't in and of itself mean that it wasn't always this way. <br />Eller's treatment raises new, important questions, but I found her conclusions closely bordering on the same close-mindedness of the matriarchalists she broadly paints. For some, I imagine to latch onto a fanciful notion of how things could have been might serve a vital and validating rationale. Sure, to keep grounded in that purpose is also equally important, as well as to refrain from dismissing critiques ad hominem, something Eller also criticizes. Nevertheless, most religions thrive under similar cultural myths reaffirming for many a healthy way to be in the world. I'm not saying this can't be unhealthy - indeed, such worldviews continue to be very destructive - but I don't think that creation myths, which appear in most cultures, are necessarily harmful. Indeed, such myths seem to characterize at least one aspect of our humanity, sourness and all. <br />A much broader and important task would be to examine the significance of the civilized worldview to see why it, as opposed to our more intrinsic and sustainable tribal heritage, has flourished so uncontrollably at the expense and denial of our organic roots. Another book, perhaps?	2001-08-31

His research is (mostly) thorough (one critic accuses him of dismissing research that details differences among different races of humans; e.g., the variety that asks why blacks are better at sports than whites, and why Asians are better mathematicians), and I noticed Ehrlich repeatedly refraining from stating absolute truths about human behaviors. Instead, he acknowledges our many differences and why we can't ultimately insist that humanity is what the Euro-American-centered view of it often makes it out to be, but rather, that as multiple cultures evolved over time, we adopted many cultural differences (as well as our genetic structures evolving) that make us unique within our species.  <br /> In his stressing humanity's multiple traits, he also states that we are not automatically predisposed to enlightenment any more so than we are predisposed to self-annihilation: Both are characteristic of humanity and always have been, so to assume one over the other as a way of being for all of humanity is rather ridiculous.  <br /> Of most importance, however, is Erhlich's examination of humans as tribal creatures. The presenting problem of our world today is that even though we are small-group peoples, &quot;we are ... trying to maintain health, happiness, and a feeling of connectedness in an increasingly impersonal world in which individual natures are based on ever small fractions of society's cultures.&quot; But I wish Ehrlich would have explored the point more in depth: What are the specific and wide-ranging ramifications of our large-group aspirations when, historically, we have lived in small-groups? Does this mean globalism will be our undoing? Is Ehrlich implying that we should &quot;go local&quot;? He presents these issues while refraining from exploring some the potentially controversial consequences of our 10,000-year-old behavior, when we began to change from tribal/small-band people to sedentary agriculturists. <br /> Despite these few minor criticisms, Human Natures explains perhaps more about humanity in a single volume than at least what I've ever read--with very current references no less. And his treatment of this vast subject is fairly objective which both benefits and slightly detracts from the book in the end. Nevertheless, Human Natures is a valuable addition to any who work with people or are open to rethinking how we will look back on ourselves 3 million years from now, assuming there are any of us left by then.	2001-02-17

Yoors lived with the Rom on and off through their genocidal persecution under Hitler's regime. A lyrical writer, Yoors captures a detailed essence of these people whose seemingly mysterious ways, he points out, were often perpetuated by the Rom themselves as defense mechanisms against civilized culture (or Gadje, the outsiders). His account demonstrates personal and cultural revelations about how the Rom have been persecuted through time in the form of outright racism, genocide, and overt hostility which continues through today. The US only recently -- 1998 -- decided to stop officially discriminating against US-based Rom, and the word 'gyp' is still commonly used as a slur even among seemingly enlightened people. More importantly, Yoors' account reveals how, despite the racist, mysterious, mainstream view of the Rom, they instead lived a relatively carefree, dependable lifestyle in which each tribal member was (is) cared for.	2001-01-04

Abram approaches the multifaceted phenomenology of human perception from the vantagepoint of our hunter-gatherer/tribal kin in relation to the modern world and how we shifted our senses to be who we are today. Abram's view is in-depth, much more so than I could adequately follow at times (my deficit, not his), and he establishes part of his thesis by asserting how: <br /> &quot;Conventional scientific discourse priviledges the sensible field in abstraction from sensory experience, and commonly maintains that subjective experience is 'caused' by an objectifiable set of processes in the mechanically determined field of the sensible. Meanwhile, New Age spiritualism regularly priviledges pure sentience, or subjectivity, in abstraction from sensible matter, and often maintains that material reality is itself an illusory effect caused by an immaterial mind or spirit. Although commonly seen as opposed world-views, both of these positions assume a qualitative difference between the sentient and the sensed; by prioritizing one of the other, both of these views perpetuate the distinction between human 'subjects' and natural 'objects,' and hence neither threatens the common conception of sensible nature as a purely passive dimension suitable for human manipulation and use.&quot;  <br /> To top it off, although Abram's focus is on the phenomenology of perception, with emphasis given to language, the rise of the alphabet and phonetic writing, he acknowledges this view is merely part of vast-ranging processes that contributed to a fundamental cultural behavioral shift for humanity: from those who celebrated the surroundings within which they lived (simply, hunter-gatherers) to those that view themselves as separate from and dominant over the life-world in which they coexist in (us, the people of modern cultures). In other words, Abram leaves open the fact that &quot;many other factors could have been chosen&quot; for which to focus on,for instance, the rise of arable agriculture roughly 10,000 years ago.  <br /> Abram's book flows with the complexity, subtlety and beauty of our natural world, so I recommend it with caution, that in our modern, so-called civilized age, many of us, though intrinsically capable of animistic awareness (because, as living beings, we are ultimately part of the same space, time and matter of that in which we inhabit), have been dulled on a daily basis by modernities and our incessant cultural commotion. Be that as it may, this work may be difficult to follow, especially if approached from a linear, mechanistic, technocratic viewpoint. Correspondingly, Abram is clear to remind us that this work is more about &quot;a style of thinking ... that associates truth not with static fact, but with a quality of a relationship.&quot; <br /> The Spell of the Sensuous is a one-of-a-kind document of animistic awareness. It is a brilliant compliment to aspects of Daniel Quinn's work as well as the efforts of many others concerned about the &quot;depths of our ongoing reciprocity with the world.&quot;	2001-01-04

Senge approaches his systems thinking model pragmatically, and he cautions those in companies about key areas that can and will impede progress to new ways of thinking about, say, management. His goal is realistic, his examples lucid and what he forewarns and suggests can improve any organization that is experiencing learning disabilities. Senge's influence is from group process theory, psychotherapy, environmental sustainability (Ray Anderson and Daniel Quinn are cited), consultation gurus and even spiritualists. What kept coming up for me his how Senge treats organizations much like how a therapist may work with a client:  as an advocate, a coach and mentor. The processes to change are similar. My only complaint is that Senge speaks of learning organizations commonly as corporations -- even though this work can be applied to even a small business -- and I wish he could have used more diverse examples: from social service agencies, schools and others (these grounds are covered, I hear, in The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook). His focus is corporate. Not that this pegs him as the antichrist, but merely that his language often reflects and is directed toward the business culture. Nevertheless, his conclusion expands parameters to include not only humanity but the more-than-human world in which we reside. He closes with quotes from Quinn's My Ishmael about how the &quot;revolution&quot; will be incremental, and how the dance of change will occur organically, much like the process of the living world.	2000-10-31

White slavery in the U.S., the relativity of power (i.e., how poor whites are similar to poor blacks in social status), the cultural legacy of poor, white trash, and why it's safe, if not culturally encouraged, to trash lower-class whites, are some of numerous topics covered. While Goad misses a larger cultural significance (see, e.g., Daniel Quinn), he does add to the history of white people never before told, and, in fact, manages to do so in a way that reflects how he feels about the fact that this story has been ignored. The ill-at-ease with this subject will steer clear--with the danger of remaining uninformed about a vital portion of human history. Vital.	2000-10-19

After reading Paul Hawken's The Ecology of Commerce and Daniel Quinn's Ishmael, Anderson revolutionized his beliefs and how his company does business. He is now striving for 100-percent sustainability by having zero waste, reusing materials, not using non-renewable resources, such as petroleum, and by leasing his carpet rather than selling it. Why this is important: 1) The obvious reasons such as not being wasteful and polluting, 2) Interface is now a model for all industry, 3) Anderson shows how sustainability is more profitable, and 4) Anderson's model shows that it only takes changing minds to be a successfully revolutionary--not street protests, letters to the editor, petitions, meditation, spiritual consciousness, believing in God, lobbying Congress, protesting governments and/or corporations, and all the typically tried and often painfully slow ways to enact positive change.

Without an understanding of the human experience in the world, our perception is blurred, quite literally it often seems. Sewell explains how our visual and spiritual sight is dulled by modernities and uses this thesis to place human relations to all things. I found her view to be thorough but her exploration limited. What about the other senses? Further, Sewell's mandate for how we treat our environment is appropriate, and she often refers to tribal people, but not once does she refer to the tribal experience. In fact, her lessons are often about the individual experience in nature, as a way to achieve a visionary experience, and I wonder how it is tribal people related to nature: as individuals or as a tribe? Yes, we are fragmented with our surroundings, but with each other as well.	2000-10-13

Hellinger's message is one of humility in accepting what is, especially the natural order of relationships. For instance, rather than bemoaning an abusive father, Hellinger will stand by the victimizer and have the victim, a son or daughter, humbly acknowledge the father for being the father and to place the circumstances as secondary. In this action, the natural order of the relationship becomes untangled. Hellinger is more interested not in details but in finding what works in resolving problems. The past is past, he seems to say with each page's turn, and focusing on making things right is his intent. <br /> From my personal work, I have seen how this work is indeed powerfully effective, and because of Hellinger's non-linear, often intangible approach, he is a controversial and immensely popular figure in psychotherapy. This review does not do this book or Hellinger's work justice. In reading Love's Hidden Symmetry, I found myself reading only a small section, then putting down the book to sit with whatever I had just read. Each section is worth more than the space on its page, in other words. It took some time to complete it, and a better understanding of what he says will probably only come in time and in multiple readings. Hellinger's work talks precisely about being humbled by each other and our processes and how things work as they do. Moreoever, through his readings and family constellations I have discovered how powerfully my lineage influences who I am. The brilliance of this work is in its systemic significance: how noted events, such as war or murder, can have lasting effects transgenerationally. <br /> My only criticism his is limited inclusion about environmental factors and the role of civilization in contributing to individual psychological problems; this area isnot seeming to be his focus. Instead, Hellinger, a master psychotherapist, appears more interested in redirecting our entangled relationships with each other. I leave my first reading of this book still intent on people finding healthier ways to live, rather than just necessarily focusing on their healing; at the same time, I am blown away by what Hellinger does for the individual and family end of things. It is simply unlike no other I have been exposed to before.	2000-10-13

Ishmael, the gorilla, takes the narrator onto a journey of humanity while challenging the him to see humanity, and its role on this planet, in a way never before told. What's more is that everything Ishmael brings out is confirmed by the work of anthropologists, philosophers, biologists and ecologists, and, unlike others who question humanity's position in life, Ishmael questions whether we need prophets. A new way to live is more on his agenda, and it may follow the model lived by humans for millions of years: the tribe. This book is touching, easy to read and difficult to grasp. I've read it six times, taught it as a high-school unit twice, and I still haven't received all that is presented in here. I joined an Ishmael email list for some time and discovered most of the people on there saw Ishmael as some New Age guru telling us to eat a vegetarian diet and live simply.

He also explains how tribal peoples were inherently sustainable, healthier, and how we can learn from their organizations and beliefs. His message is vital and lucid; however, I felt some of his solutions--&quot;Reconnecting with God--directly,&quot; &quot;living off the grid,&quot; and higher spiritual consciousness--in some ways only affirm what has been done for eons without a noticeable global effect. Otherwise, this is mostly on the mark.	2000-10-13

Humans are more genetically similar to chimpanzees than dogs are among their differing breeds. And yet humans have evolved to the point of threatening their future within only about 10,000 years, after a successful evolution as hunter-gatherers for millions of years prior to the birth of widespread agriculture and civilization. Diamond convincingly tells the story of this evolution along with explanations for our behaviors. Heeding his warning, should we choose to continue to evolve as a species, will be critical.	2000-10-13

His message is one of balance, and he illustrates his views with ancient Native anecdotes. I read this for my multicultural counseling class, and it was easily one of the best books for examining my personal worldview.  This is easy reading with an important message for individuals and their environment. Of most importance: acknowledging how humans are interconnected with all things (and, in my view, therefore no better than anything else).	2000-10-13

He answers questions psychologists have struggled with--and continue to struggle with--primarily because the lens of this anthropologist isn't afraid to examine things from an evolutionary stance. Harris repeats earlier themes (from previous books) as well as examining the role of women in modern culture, race, warfare, food choice and diet, and much more. His insights about modern culture remain profound, and yet so many ignore the work of people like Harris. Perhaps there's a danger in these informative tracts.	2000-10-13

The story is more fabricated than Quinn's previous two--the girl talks and processes her thoughts as if she were in her 30s, which, come to think of it is no more or less imaginative than a talking gorilla--but the information is nonetheless just as important. Some new stuff here includes rethinking the educational process of our children, which, from my perspective, is sorely needed.	2000-10-13

White slavery in the U.S., the relativity of power (i.e., how poor whites are similar to poor blacks in social status), the cultural legacy of poor, white trash, and why it's safe, if not culturally encouraged, to trash lower-class whites, are some of numerous topics covered. While Goad misses a larger cultural significance (see, e.g., Daniel Quinn), he does add to the history of white people never before told, and, in fact, manages to do so in a way that reflects how he feels about the fact that this story has been ignored. The ill-at-ease with this subject will steer clear--with the danger of remaining uninformed about a vital portion of human history. Vital.	2000-10-13

For example, Tudge covers the extinction of large mammals in North America by humans (it was a mathematical certainty, he says), the rise of agriculture which lead to our rise in population, and how our agriculture may just be our own doing in. Tudge explores current theories and then comes to his own conclusions which all seem plausible by the book's end. If you want to avoid searching the bookshelves for human ecological and biological histories, this book may sum up what you need to know.	2000-10-13

Keeley misses, or dismisses, some major points made by other anthropologists about how hunter-gatherers were indeed healthy and free of the stresses of modern life. Keeley doesn't always differentiate between hunter-gatherers, tribes, and chiefdoms but rather analyzes data based on prehistoric people of all social organizations, many of which I suspect behaved more like civilized cultures in terms of territorial expansion and warfare. Instead Keeley focuses on instances when that was/is not the case and ends up glorifying civilization by saying what humans need is increased civilization in a global sense because our death rates are lower than in prehistoric times. To him the choice is obvious; then again, he barely mentions the consequences of civilization that many other anthropologists, scientists, philosophers, politicians, etc. have examined to death. A final aside: Despite Keeley's case, his argument appears to rely more on a scientific view than that of the experiences of those who have actually spent time with tribal people (see, e.g., Jean Liedloff and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas).	2000-10-13

This book shows, in an uncompromising way, how people with the best of intentions to help others end up doing more harm than good. Specifically, Maren takes his first-hand experience, the anecdotes of others and the words and records of the organizations he criticizes, to show how international charity, aid organizations and the United Nations are less set up to help poor people than they are to further their own bureaucracies. As an aid worker himself and later a correspondent, Maren examines 19 years of foreign aid in Kenya, Burkina, Faso, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sudan, Ethiopia and the U.S. to show how foreign aid did far from improving situations in these countries; instead, these organizations made things worse, far worse. Aid organizations, Maren concludes, end up epitomizing ethnocentric colonialism at the expense of the poor people they allege to help. Maren's unforgiving research paints a picture the commercials of Sally Struthers are incapable of and stridently resistant to telling. Humanitarian intervention, as Maren pens it, is a destructive force preying on the guilt of those who appear to be better off--middle class, American consumers . As Maren convincingly shows, however, the road to hell is paved with the illusions of modern civilization. The overt victims are evident while the less-obvious victims remain nave and in denial. With any luck, The Road to Hell will change that.	2000-10-13
