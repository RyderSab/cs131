In the first couple of chapters, he makes the case that the Boom is real and will be ongoing, for several reasons.  The availabilty to money and the projected demand for housing from various demographic groups are a couple of the reasons. <br /> <br />The books then has seven chapters on the ins and out of finding, purchasing and profiting on real estate investments.  These are all good chapters and will be very informative to anyone interested in real estate. <br /> <br /> <br />The author shows an understandable bias to real estate agents and brokers and only briefly mentions some of the alternative means of acquiring real estate.  This is certainly not one of those 'no-money-down-real-estate' or get-rich-fast systems.  His primary concern is the conventional methods of acquiring and financing real estate investments and that anyone can get into and make money in the market. <br /> <br />He concludes the book with advice on how to take advantage of the Boom and how real estate should be a part of everyone's investment portfolio. <br /> <br />Is Lereah right about the future of the housing market - especially the 'bubble' locations around the country?  Who can say?  Boom or no boom, the basic information in the middle of the book alone makes this a very useful resource.  But it should not be the only resource.	2005-10-06

Harv Eker, motivational speak and seminar host, gives his valuable insights in to the mentality and thought processes of the rich (and those who are on their way) versus the poor.  He frequently compares and contrasts the two classes, not for character flaws, but for \\"thinking\\" flaws.  He makes a compelling case and I people for fit each of the types he describes. <br /> <br />In the first part of the book he introduces the \\"Money Blueprint\\" that each of us carries in our heads.  This is the set of ideas and attitudes towards money, work, wealth and success that we pick up from parents, friends, co-workers, etc.  This blueprint determines how successful we will be in accumulating wealth.  For example, if you think all rich people are bad, then you will probably not become rich (because you do not want to be bad).  He contends that you will subconsciously mishandle your resources so that you never succeed in accumulating wealth. <br /> <br />The second and longer part of the book contains Eker's 17 \\"Wealth Files\\" or principles for attaining wealth.  These are all good, if not particularly new, insights and are valuable even as reminders.  He refers to his seminar many times, pulling anecdotes and examples from them.  That is OK, but it tends to get old.  There is no detailed advice on exactly HOW to gain wealth (other than his general recommendation to purchase real estate), but rather, how to mentally gear up for the process. <br /> <br />This is a good motivational book and most readers should find something to think about. <br /> <br />The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that he plugs his seminar a lot.  A LOT. <br />	2005-09-23

Based on the first 4 chapters of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, this story examines what Adam and Eve may have experienced after their expulsion form the Garden of Eden. <br /> <br />This story chronicles their journey from Eden to the East where they eventually settle to raise their family.  After being removed from paradise for eating from the Tree of Knowledge at the prompting of the serpent, the couple struggle to survive.  They have no provider, no teacher, no help and no clue.  They must invent all of the skills required to survive, such as fishing, hunting, agriculture, animal husbandry, etc.  Some of Adam's attempts to provide for his wife are comical such as the time he presents her with a mushroom and a frog for supper. <br /> <br />The story is told in chronological reverse order from the completion of the city of Enoch, named after the son of Cain, the first murderer. <br /> <br />On the surface, this is a fast moving east-to-read story.  Below that, though, it raises many questions that linger in the Genesis account.  Were humans created evil?  If not, why was there evil in the Garden?  Were they just acting according to their nature when they disobeyed God?  Was God unfair to them?  Were they set up?  Are all humans born evil?  Eve and Cain are the more skeptical of the four main characters.  The have a harder time handling these questions.  They often voice their questions about God and the situation and are quite vocal about their displeasure with the entire scheme of things.  Adam and Abel, on the other hand, still see God as the loving  provider and desire to please Him though offerings.  It is the acceptance of Abel's sacrifice and the rejection of Cain's that pushes Cain to leave the family and eventually slay Abel. <br /> <br />Don't be put off by these questions.  This is not a philosophy or theology book. It is a novel.  It is easy to read and accurately reflects the scant writings of Genesis while building a logical and interesting speculation of what else happened. <br />	2005-09-19

The House on Mango Street contains snippets and flashes and scenes from the childhood of a Latino girl named Esperanza who lives in a poor section of Chicago.  The glimpses into her life are told from her point of view, told with the innocence of a child at first but then with less and less as she gets older.  Some of memories are happy and some are quite sad.  She tells of interesting people she encounters on Mango Street, giving a child's impression of odd neighbors and relatives.  We learn about her sister Nenny and her fried Sally.  In just a few words, we as adults know enough of the situations to understand some of the things she does not.  That makes the stories even more poignant.  It is a short book and makes you want to know more about Esperanza.	2005-08-31

His name is predominate on the book jacket.  But that is not inappropriate as he is the focus of the book. His major deals and properties are the center of attention and make the book worth reading. <br /> <br />George H. Ross, successful New York City real estate attorney, long-time associate of Trump and apparantly player in the Trump reality show, The Apprentice, is the major contributer to the book.  His name is next.  Mr. Ross has been in the business a very long time and also lectures on the skill of negotiation. <br /> <br />At the bottom of the page we find the author, Andrew James McLean, who has written several books on real estate investing.   <br /> <br />This book is interesting, if simple.  The anecdotes about Donald Trump make it worth reading. The details of the Trump Tower, Mar-A-Lago, and the GM Building, for example are very interesting.  There is also quite a bit of chest thumping and self-congratulations in this short book, but who can argue with success?   <br /> <br />The advice given in this book is very good, but neither new nor Earth-shaking.  Anyone who is making it in the real estate world probably already knows this, but it never hurts to have it reenforced.  The point that hit me the most was to avoid the tendancy to focus on the property more than the customers.  There are tips on negotiation, how to find and treat customers, how to handle difficult people and how to stay out of trouble.  This is not a how-to book, but has some excellent pointers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-25

This is the 7th of a set - not a series, but a set - of books about the Ionian-built gateways.  I have not problems with the actual stories.  They are good, well-written, Star Trek fare, spanning all televised series and the later book series that developed.    What really ticks me off is that none of the stories are complete.  They are all continued and reach their conclusions in separate sections of this book.  So what this book is is the final chapters of 6 other books.    This book does not stand alone in any way, nor does it tie the other stories together.  Why not just conclude each book in the set as it was written!    If you have read any of volumes 1-6 of this set you will need to read this one to find out how it ends.    I would buy it used or check it out from the library, though, just to send the publisher a message.	2005-08-13

He only lived 32 years but created an Empire that spanned 1000's of miles and included many cultures.  He was tutored by Aristotle and raised to be a king.  He toppled Darius of Persia, conquered the surrounding areas and invaded India.  When he took on a task, he stayed with it with dogged determination.  He was a brilliant battlefield tactition and motivator of men.   <br /> <br />The story of his life was recorded by the classic biographers, Arrian, Plutarch and Curtius.  In this book, Michael Wood presents Alexander's story by compiling the different accounts in chronological order.  There is very little additional text, editorial, background, etc.  Sometimes, he interjects comments where the original accounts vary (due to the biases of the biograhpers).  This is a simple book to read and understand.  It is an excellent resource for someone who wants an introduction to Alexander. <br /> <br />The map, list of sources and gloassary of main characters are quite helpful.	2005-08-12

Kirk, the captain of the USS Enterprise.  Oddly enough, for the uninitiated, this story is set in the 24th century, that of Picard and company.  Kirk was resurrected by Borg technology, Scott survived the ride from the Original Series years in a transporter beam and Spock and McCoy simply live through the years, Spock naturally, due to a long lifespan and McCoy with the help of a LOT of technology. <br /> <br />Now, this crew unites with that of Picard's Enterprise and Admiral Janeway to combat a new threat to the galaxy.  Someone is trying to start a Romulan civil war and the first thing they do is assassinate Spock, who has been working tirelessly in the effort to reunite the peoples of Romulus and Vulcan. <br /> <br />Kirk's son is believed to be important to the population of Remus, the sister planet of Romulus.  While he tries to investigate the death of Spock, the slaves on Remus demand that Kirk turns his son over to them.  Also, Kirk encounters an alien from his past, a story that is told I the 1st installment of this trilogy, Captain's Peril.   Read that to learn more about the alien and the origin of the young human-romulan-klingon hybrid that the Kirk's son. <br /> <br />With all of this going on, how and Kirk and Picard and the rest prevent a war that may sweep across the galaxy?  We all know they will, the fun is in finding out how. <br /> <br />This book is easy to read and moves along well.  When the final part is published, I intend to see how it turns out. <br />	2005-07-29

They collect artifact, rare plants, and anything else that has monetary value in the dreary world of the future.  This collection of short storys, some previously published, shows snippets of the very longs lives of Mendoza, Budu, Lewis and other cyborgs who appear in the novels of the Company. <br /> <br />Alec Checkerfield, also a creation of Dr Zeus but not a cyborg - well, not like the others - is featured in four stories.  These are part of the foundation for the novel `The Life on the World To Come', also by Baker. <br /> <br />I love what Baker has created and enjoyed each of the stories.  While they stand alone as written, the reader will enjoy them more if the previous novels in this series are read as well.  They fill in many of the holes that the stories expose (but cannot fill without turning into a novel).  Since the setting of the series is the entire planet and all of recorded history (plus the future up until 2355) there is plenty of room for more stories of this type and I hope to see more soon. <br />	2005-07-22

I don't generally like reading books in a series until the entire series is available.  Even though I had read all of the \\"Company\\" books up until this one, I held off quite a while before reading this volume and I regret it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story.   <br /> <br />If you have not read the previous book about the Dr Zeus corporation and their cyborgs who live throughout time, collecting artifacts, plants, information and running other errands for their masters, you should begin the \\"The Garden Of Iden\\". <br /> <br />Although Botanist Mendoza is the central figure of the 1st book, she comes and goes in subsequest books and other stories are told that flesh out the entire world Kage Baker has created.  Mendoza plays a role here, but the primary story is of Alec Checkerfield, a creation of three rather kooky Inkling-wanabees in the far future.  It ties him and the other two love interests of Mendoza together. <br /> <br />We see a very good glimpse of the future - it is a ridiculously regulated society but one that could be a logical extension of our own. <br /> <br />Is Checkerfield the reason for the silent period that follows July 9,2355? or are there other forces at work.  All questions are not answered here but a great number are. <br /> <br />This is a must read for fans of the Company series.	2005-07-17

They have been here since the Earth cooled, but only in the last couple of centuries have we truly come to understand them.  In 'the ingredients', Phillip Ball takes the reader on a fast ride through the development of our understanding of the elements.  Aristotle and his contemporaries saw everything pretty much as a combination of earth, wind, fire, and water.  Variations of this view lasted well in the middle ages. <br /> <br />The chapter on gold, precious from ancient times, is a bridge, bringing us into the modern age, where we see the development of the Periodic Table, an organization of information about the elements.  Scientific method and technological advances allowed chemists to identify each of the elements.  Physics, radiochemistry and quantum mechanics provided an explanation of why they act as they do. <br /> <br />There are interesting discussions of medicine, alchemy and other topics.  The chapter on manmade elements is also interesting. <br /> <br />This little book was fun to read and should be easily followed by the non-scientific reader.	2005-07-07

He only lived 32 years and yet, continues to be the subject of book and film.  Many questions surround him.  Was he truly 'great' or was he a butcher?  How did he die?  Was he and his mother involved in the death of his father, Phillip?     This is a well-researched book with many pages of references and notes.  Rogers presents the history of Alexander based on the major sources \\"contemporary\\" to the subject and includes information from more removed (in time) sources.    If you are interested in the details of the battles, you will find this book very interesting.  For most battles, it includes a diagram of the battlefield.  Some readers may be put off by the long detailed discussions of the battles.    There is, of course, not much new information that can be added to the ancient sources, but we do know a lot of about the customs and social standards of that day in Greece, Persia and India.  Rogers addresses some of the social customs of the times, of Alexanders transition to or incorporation of Persian customs, but there could have been a lot more.  I wish there had been.     Rather than 'settle' some of the arguments or make judgements about Alexander and the things he did, Rogers tries to put his actions into perspective.  He encourages the reader to judge the man in his own environment and times.	2005-06-22

I gave this book the highest rating because it is one of the best of its kind.  This is definitely one of the best novelizations of a movie I have ever read.   I read it before viewing the film and it added depth to characters and motivations to their actions that were hard to find in the movie.  This story fills in most of the plot gaps between Star Wars 1 and 2 and The New Hope.  <br /> <br />I won't recap the plot, but here are some highlights. <br /> <br />This book clarifies how Anakin's fear of loss (of his wife Padme) drove him from one bad decision to the next and eventually into the position of apprentice to Darth Sidious, Sith Lord.  A primary teaching of the Jedi is to release attachment to things and people, for these attachments cause weakness and distraction.  Anakin will no-doubt become the textbook example in the next Jedi school. <br /> <br />How can 1 Sith (and his apprentice) outwit and eliminate the Jedi?  The Jedi had become complacent in their teachings and practices.  Too late, Yoda realizes this and is forced (no pun intended) to retreat into hiding on Dagobah (where we find him in The Empire Strikes Back).   <br /> <br />How does democracy fall?  With cheering and applause, according to Padme Amadala, as the Chancellor maneuvers, lies and schemes his way into position as Emperor.  &lt;SOAPBOX ON> The Clone Wars serves the same purpose as the 9/11 attack in making people WANT to surrender their rights - a la the Patriot Act &lt;SOAPBOX OFF>.  Watch as Palpatine outwits everyone, including the 900-year-old Yoda.  <br /> <br />The writing is well done and I loved the layout and approach the author takes. <br /> <br />Read this books before you see the movie.

Most people have at some level, an interest or curiousity in things that are considered 'spiritual'.  Philip Zaleski has selected an excellent collection of essays and poems that reflect a wide range of spiritual-related ideas, musings, stories and expressions.   <br /> <br />The number of essays is over twice that of poems but the volume of writing in the essays is probably fifty-fold that of the poems, so if you are looking for poetry, this is not the best source. <br /> <br />Keep in mind that the group is of 'spiritual' writing and not 'Christian', meaning that from essay to essay, idealogies will vary so much that at times you will wonder why they are even in the collection.  Viewpoints move from naturalism to Buddism to Catholicism and more. <br /> <br />I found some of the essays very interesting.  What will appeal to a different reader?  It's hard to guess.  But any reader with the slightest interest in things spiritual or spiritual people or other cultures are sure to find something he likes here.  <br /> <br /> <br />Some of my favorites were: <br />The introdction <br />Physics and Grief <br />Judaism beyond Words <br />What The Blind See <br /> <br /> <br />As I said, the poetry is a relativly minor part of the collection.

While it would probably be a mistake to assume that all, or even most kitchens resemble those he describes and that everything he reports is truly factual about the kitchens in which he has worked, it is very interesting.  Considering his position as executive chef at Les Halles, his program on Food Network, and his non-trivial writing career, Bourdain does not appear to be the whacked out cook drifting from job to job that we see in this book.   <br /> <br />A very entertaining read.

These were the years that shaped her, the launching pad of her feminist, anti-family, pro-socialist, anti-war, ... efforts.   <br /> <br />The reader can learn a good bit about the Socialist movement in Oklahoma in the early 1900's, the Green Corn Rebellion and the patriotic surge that accompanied World War I. <br /> <br />Roxanne's grandfather, one of the less 'disfunctional' family members was a Socialist and strongly pro-labor and imparted his views to her.  She remembers him fondly.  It appears that her abusive alcoholic mother influenced her ideas about the family and church.  She had very little to say about her mother or father that is not negative.  Considering these influences, the dire poverty of her early childhood, and her marriage 'up' the social ladder her views on things are not too surprising.  Simple - yes, but undeniably true, at least in part.  And that does not take away from her drive, talent and desire to make a positive change in the world. <br /> <br />You can learn more about Roxanne at her website, reddirt.com. <br /> <br />I think I will read Outlaw Woman, the next volume of her story.	2005-02-11

The story climaxes in the relatively unknown Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. <br /> <br />Some of the characters are a bit characaturish, such as the neurotic social-climbing-try-to-forget-my-dirt-poor-roots wife, the oil barron wannabe, and the evil Japheth.  But they do not ruin the story.  If this were pure fiction, I might not give it 5 stars, but as a piece of historical fiction, I do. <br /> <br />The treatment of African-American's in the story and in the events upon which it is based is downright grim.  Does this reflect reality?  I honestly do not know, but I suspect that it does.  And that bothers me a lot. <br /> <br />I do not think any book has ever lead me to consider the (mis)treatment of African-American's in the United State more than this one.  While it is impossible for me to EVER fully understand how someone else feels, I feel that I understand a bit more than I did before I read this book. <br /> <br />My recommendation:  Read this book. <br />	2005-02-08

It is about a regular guy who takes a trip, via a portal to a parallel Earth, into a land of magic.  This fast-moving story covers the basics; love, , wimp-become-hero, good-vs-evil, descendants of Norse gods, etc.  Green spins an interesting version of this old, yet popular concept.  His use of beings from 'our' mythology enables the reader to readily identify with many of his characters.  I enjoyed reading it.	2005-02-04
US	31659483	RKYOVEFYQEV8L	0345475674	451458080	Pompeii: A Novel	Books	3	1	6	N	N	Roman water works boss turns volcanologist/sleuth	This 3.5 star story is set in the region around Pompeii just a couple of days before the volcano Vesuvius buries it.  The protagonist, an 'aquarius' - works for the water department in Rome and is sent to investigate a problem with the aquaduct system near the city identified in the book title.    He encounters disgruntled laborors, corrupt city officials, scholars, and a love interest.      Harris does a good job of describing the lives of people from various stations of life in the Empire, especially the 'lower' positions.  He portreys things that are different - technology, food, views of the worth of the individual - and the things that remain the same - greed, snobbery, government bureaucracy, violence and powermongering.     I found it even more interesting for the picture of ancient Rome that it paints than the plot, but the story moves along well, keeps you turning the pages and comes together quite well.	2005-02-04

This is one of many shameful moments in our history.  Several thousand people died as a result. <br /> <br />The main character struggles to deal with the estrangement of her husband, the deaths of her family, loss of her farm and her relationship with a white soldier. <br /> <br />This book is not a Whites-are-bad and Indians-are-good tirade, and it does, in fact, show good and bad actions of individuals of both sides.  It is also not just written to make Americans ashamed of their past.  But it does ask poignant questions, such as How could so-called believers of Christ treat other people like they did? <br /> <br />Good question. <br /> <br />How would I make out on such a trip?  I do not know. <br /> <br />Glancy explores human nature through Cherokee culture, the decent of human to animal and back.  Under what conditions do we turn back into the animal, the bear? <br /> <br />It is hard to read - literally - it is told in the first person viewpoint by over a dozen people.  After the first third of the story, however, I got used to it.  That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  But stick with it, it is worth the trip.	2005-01-21
US	31659483	R2LNTDFJ3NGYN9	0765346095	193033614	Gunpowder Empire (Crosstime Traffic)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Two teenagers get a shocking introduction to old Rome	Harry Turtledove is a master of alternative history and has many excellent novels to his credit.      Using the alternative reality device rather than time travel, Turtledove gives us a glimpse of what might have been 20th century Europe had Rome never fallen.   He doesn't give the Empire much of a chance of progressing very far beyond its state at its peak.    Through the eyes of two teenagers, we experience the problems of sanitation, slavery and war.  They are trapped in this world without their parents and must survive on their own.  We see them deal with the contemporary problems of snobbery, sexism and bloated government bureaucracy.      This book is simply written.  Teens might enjoy it.    This is definitely NOT Turtledove's best effort.	2005-01-21

The first half is his autobiography.  While reading it I saw his 'bio' of one of the cable channels.  I must say that the sanitized TV version did not do justice to the book - hmmmm sounds like a chronic Stephen King problem.  I'll not spend any time about his story except to say that I liked (1) the way he did NOT glorify his drug and alcohol abuse and (2) the way he (at least in writing) praises his wife.  I don't read much of his fiction, but I respect him for those things. <br /> <br />The how-to section is good and interesting.  He offers very practical advice and down-to-earth opinions.  You might get more from other books on writing, but most are not written by someone of King's stature in the publishing world.  That alone makes it worth reading. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-07-20
US	31659483	RJCXUMWYXKBRX	0965922820	64356132	The Rapture Trap: A Catholic Response to End Times Fever	Books	3	13	23	N	N	40% good, 60% off-topic, unprofessional &amp; unnecessary	Disclaimer:  I am not Catholic.  I am not a Lahaye fan.  I am not convinced of the timing of the 'rapture'.  I believe that the Bible teaches that it will happen .... eventually.  I can live with that.<br />I understand that Dr. Thigpen is presenting a (well deserved) Catholic response to the LaHaye series and at the same time expressing the Church's teaching on the topic of the 2nd coming of Christ.  I found it distracting that he makes so many sarcastic generalizations about Fundamentalists.  It is clear that he had many problems with LaHaye but, in places, he resorts to name-calling,  placing him on the same level as LaHaye.<BR>  <BR>In making his point, he oversells the difference in the beliefs of those holding to that 'risky rapture scheme' (my words) and the Catholic position.  In the end, he completely omitted the Church's teaching on the subject, making it seem that the difference in beliefs are drastically apart, when in fact, it might just be a matter of timing.  (Refer to &quot;False Profit:  Money, Prejudice, and Bad Theology in Tim LaHaye's Left Behind Series, A Catholic Answers Special Report&quot; from Catholic Answers, San Diego 2003)  Will believers be changed and 'caught up' (raptured - who cares that the word has a Latin root)?  Yes, the Church says, but not when SOME Protestants teach.  Probably later.<br />Logic errors are distracting too.  For example, is the teaching of the 'pre-tribulation rapture' new?  Yes it appears to be less than 200 years old.  But it is his own argument that revelation from God has continued after the Bible was completed.  So why does it matter that this idea is relatively new?<br />Ultimately, he admits that the Church has not come forth with a detailed statement of the meaning of some of these passages and the the Bible student must do his or her best to find the answer. In fact, the actual statement regarding the 2nd coming of Christ mirrors (or is mirrored in, depending on one's viewpoint) that of the Southern Baptists' statement in their statement of faith, &quot;Faith and Message&quot;.<br />I recommend this book, but keep in mind that it is part doctrinal and part 'pep talk for Catholics'.  As one would infer from the title, it never claims to be a 'balanced' treatment of the topic and that is fine.  Honest labeling.  <br />It also challenged me think a lot about many things.  I like that.	2004-06-11

Up front, I disclose that I am neither a historian nor Catholic and offer these comments as someone who simply read the book.  Green, an early convert to Catholicism, offers a simple rendition of the life of Francis.  The book is well-crafted; easy to read and to keep reading.  There is enough of the history surrounding the subject to position it in time and place, but the reader is not bogged down in the details.  There is no offer of defense for the miraculous events attributed to Francis.  Rather, Green simply describes them as matter-of-factly as he does the Italian contryside.<br />Francis was as a young man over-indulged in its pleasures, but suddenly did an aboutface and spent the rest of his life serving God and attemping to remove ANYTHING from his life that might distract him from that service.<br />The example of single-minded determination that Francis lived serves us all well.  Were we to apply the same energy to our own pursuits, who know what may be accomplished.<br />An inspiration to us all.	2004-05-04

I grew up in the deep South in the 1960's and witnessed some of the segregation and attitudes that fill this story.  But to see only that in this book would be a mistake.  There are multiple themes here.  Gaines explores the idea that we must sometimes move out of the familiar if we are going to change.  The line 'if you stay, you'll become the n***** they believe you to be' is very powerful and applies to all us all at times.  As we strive to improve ourselves, to be more than we are, there are forces that strive equally hard to keep us in 'our place'.  Often these forces are not as obvious as the bigotry portreyed in this book, but they are as real.<BR>   There is also a thread of hope sewn into this story.  Hope of change, growth and improvement.  We see it in Jefferson, in the deputy and finally in Grant himself as he learns an important lesson.  <BR>   <BR>    This book is not FUN to read, but everyone should read it.	2004-04-23

His spiritual journey, though not complete at the books end, was very interesting.  The (paraphrased) line &quot;they thought they were the first of their type and the last..&quot;, referring to his radical friends from his university days,  struck a chord.  We all slowly realize that our own well-used mold was indeed not broken after they made us.  More followed.  Alas, we all take our place in society and make the best of it.<br />Simply written and easy to read.  I recommend it.	2004-04-22
