Although I am not Christian, I am interested in the lives of Jesus, his disciples, and other biblical figures.  Of recent, Mary of Magdalene has had a rise in popularity, and so it was fitting to also have a novel about her.  This novel is very detailed, and at times long winded.  It took me a few chapters to get into and feel the characters.  But the author made Mary into a very real person to me.  However, once Mary encountered Jesus, I think the novel went flat.  I felt that their journey's were long, and felt like it would never end.  And frankly, I could see how easily people felt he had to perish in that time.  It is obvious the author spent a great deal of time on the research.  When the novel turned to Mary's written accounts of The Way after Jesus's death, my interest reappeared.  Mary seemed much more human when in her own words and feelings.	2004-06-01

A woman is found with a cut on her head, wandering around a cemetary and church.  The mystery is set as to what happened to this woman?  But the amnesia didn't last long, and soon Cassie remembers everything that happened that lead to her loss of memory.  Three years prior Cassie married Hollywood star Alex Rivers.  Life was just wonderful except for those wee moments when Alex would beat her.  And so the tale that leads Cassie to eventually leave her abusive marriage, but only after doing what every other battered woman does: keeps going back hoping he'd change, getting into therepy, having a baby.<br />I was glad to see that this novel did not involve a court case, as all the other novels by Picoult did.  And the author also portrayed domestic violence quite accurately.  But for some reason, I was not immediately pulled in, and felt I could predict the next turn.	2004-05-01

Because of &quot;Tiburon&quot; scribbled on the back of a black Madonna picture, Lily and her black housekeeper set off for this unknown town after some trouble with the law.  They finally encounter the &quot;summer sisters&quot;, and eventually Lily learns about her mother and past.  If it weren't for these strong older women that Lily mets, everything would crumble: Lily, her plans, and the novel itself.  I would have been more intrigued and given this a five star rating if we learned more about August, May, and June.<br />The setting and time make this novel workable: 1964 in the Atlantic south in the midst of the Civil Rights Era.	2004-03-16

It was sitting on my shelf for a lot longer than it should have.  Something about the cover told me to hold off, but I should have known that looks can be deceiving.  Ingrid and Astrid are mother and daughter.  But not your typical American mother and daughter team.  Ingrid is a poet with a bohemian lifestyle, and her daughter Astrid a very talented artist.  The fundamental difference is that Ingrid's and Astrid's longing in life are opposite.  Ingrid wants everything outside of the norm, and Astrid just wants a normal home life.  Of course, Astrid gets anything but a normal childhood from her mother, or the subsequent foster mothers she encounters after Ingrid is jailed for murder.<br />Narrated by Astrid, this tale is so fluid in description and feeling that you just float through the book.  I was disappointed at the end, not only because I didn't want the story to end, but because I wanted to know more.<br />Don't skip out on this great book.	2004-03-02

This book is covered in it from cover to cover, and men and women alike will find this an interesting dissection of it.  The author gives us a history lesson in the penis from ancient times to the current day erectile dysfunction boom.  He focuses quite a bit on Mr. Frued, obviously for the fact that this man was penile fixed and injected his theories right into modern day psychology textbooks.  I found the most interesting part regarding the racial penis, as it was a new look at racism in America and abroad.<br />I was a bit disappointed that the book didn't include much pop culture regarding the penis.  However, the areas the author chose to look at were very appropriate and provided new insight on that organ both men and women find fascinating.	2004-01-30

Lucas later sells Sally for marriage, and so begins the epic tale of the Turners and the Devreys.  We meet many of the descendants for Lucas and Sally.  Some are memorable and some are not.  And each of them is somehow involved with the age old themes: Money, sex, and love.<br />A family tree is included at the beginning of the novel.  I referrenced this many times as the number of cousins and all the other relations were difficult to remember.<br />This novel is viewed as a near perfect historical novel, and I have no doubts.  The author clearly did her homework here, as she weaves in the current social and political changes into the novel.  Even General Washington makes his appearance during the Revolutionary War.  She also describes in detail the building and planning of early Manhattan and other NYC boroughs.  NYC history buffs would enjoy these details.<br />A enjoyable, historical read.	2004-01-01

In The Five People You Meet in Heaven, we meet Eddie, a pathetic old man who is bitter about is life.  He thinks he has accomplished nothing, and feels reminded of it every day.  Then he dies on his 83rd birthday during an accident at work, and he is carried off to heaven to meet his five people.  Each person has a lesson to teach him, and each one of them was completely predictable.  The themes in the book are nothing new, and many a philosopher would walk away uninspired.<br />I also found this a quick read, and was skimming over many of the paragraphs.  However, I did like the ending as it summed up all life's lessons from the novel.  It was a nice little reminder that we are important to others even if we forgot it from time to time.	2004-01-01

I had the book on my shelf for quite some time; I was not sure that a book about India in the 1970's was going to be interesting.  But once I picked it up, it was hard to put it down.  The lives of the characters are richly detailed, their struggles heartfelt and at times unbelievable.  This book shows how human beings can be the cruelest species on Earth, and how kind we can be as well.  It's hard to believe what these characters endured could really be based on reality, but I imagine that it's not far off.  It's an eye opening novel.  You will enjoy the characters and feel greatly for them.  Don't skip this book, but make sure your Paxil or Prozac has kicked in first!	2003-10-26

I thought this novel was interesting, and I went thru it quickly.  It grabbed my attention, and although I didn't quite understand why Ella suddenly was attracted to Jean-Paul and turned on her husband, I really like the story.  I think that a lot was just told and not explained, for instance, why exactly did Ella want to dig up the ancient chimney?  It was almost like she suddenly announced it; no thought to why exactly she'd want to do such a thing.  There are other things in this that are left unexplained but dropped none the less.  The most interesting of characters is Isabelle, and felt this part of the novel could have stood alone.	2003-10-26

I used to work with Alzheimer's and dementia patients and saw how difficult it was for families, not to mention the person suffering.  Many families fall apart because they can not make sense of what is happening to their parent, but it was encouraging to see someone stick by and care for their parent.  I think this memoir accurately portrays the slow loss all people involved go through.  Its a great book for caretakers and anyone touched by this disease.	2003-09-28

Anna and her daughter Molly are together after Anna's divorce.  Then Leo comes into the picture, and a whole new world is opened to Anna.  So much so, that before she knows it, her daughter is taken from her and what she knew as happiness falls apart.  Anna is very introspective, very aware of her own emotion as others decide if she will get Molly back.  One thing that seemed out of place was Molly dialog because it was very intelligent and perhaps too self aware for a toddler.  But perhaps Miller did this on purpose, and it just didn't sit with me.  Regardless, this was an excellent book.	2003-07-04

Perhaps Cunningham wants to show us how we can be connected, but I found that the ties were weak.  And although detail is always good, we are not in the day of Flaubert's work, and the run on sentences were a bit much at times.  Did we really need every single detail of Clarissa buying flowers?  At times I began wondering if we were given all the minutae to help fill the pages.  The most intriguing of all characters is Laura, a housewife who just wants time to herself.  Virginia was there to be the common thread, but we do not see her at her craziest, or or most interesting.	2003-06-21

This is not a book that you have to drag yourself thru, but you do wonder if it is actually the same author that produced this sophmore effort. All is Vanity is light and predictable.  The characters are easy to relate to in some fashion, whether it be Margaret and her early mid life changes and failures, or Letty and her social climbing at all costs.<br />This novel leaves me curious... what will Schwarz's third novel be like?

And even better, Cannie stays a large woman and learns to love that.  <br />There were a few surprises in Good in Bed, which I won't spoil, but you get sucked into Cannie's life from the first sentence.  She is recently seperated from her long time boyfriend, then thinks it's a mistake sometime after.  She is enraged that he wrote about her in popular women's magazine.

Well, thank you Clea Simon for writing such a wonderful book about the bond we women have with our cats!<br />This book is packed with cat women like myself and stories illustrating the points that Clea makes about women and cats. From times before Christ, to ancient Egypt, to modern day, Clea looks at how women get the negative stereotypes that are still present today, as well as looking at why we women love our cats so much. Clea also tells her personal \\"love story\\" with her cat. This book also talks about the current feral cat problems, and what women are doing throughout the country to help control this. And yes, there is even women in the book that go a little too far: the cat hoarders.<br />I also learned something else with this book: I had taken it to work and a few co-workers spotted it. They are on my waiting list to borrow and read this book....turns out there are more women out there who really love their cats than you would imagine. These are the same women who teased me for having a picture of my cat at my desk (and referring to him as \\"The Handsome Boyfriend\\").	2003-01-21

I read it for a writing group, and can not figure out why this book was chosen.  The characters were unclear, the scenes flip flopping without warning and sometimes I was not aware that things changed until several paragraphs later. The reader is constantly being forced back and forth from present day to reminisces of days gone by without clearly seeing them come (or go!). And most off, it took quite a bit of time for me to realize that the narrator was a woman.  We never even learn her name.<br />Despite this, the driving force to keep reading was to learn more about how Billy coped with the loss of Eva, the love of his younger drinking years.  And as a bonus, this book did not focus solely on how rotton drunks are, but rather conveyed how tragic it is that they fall victim to it.	2002-12-25

So that should tell you that after years of cruising over this book, I never really wanted to read it.<br />Then after getting past a bit of the dryness (not dry humor, dry story) this book has a somewhat intriguing plot.  I found Michael and Hannah's initial relationship interesting.  It made me wonder where the story was going and what the psychological profile of Hannah was made up of.  But then the interest dropped off there.  The story jumps through Michael's life, briefly mentioning his marriage, child, then divorce.  The next time we see Hannah, she is on trial.  Yet again, we wonder about her, why she did what she did, why she is doing what she was doing in the trial.<br />And then the story ends in what seemingly is supposed to be a tragic ending.

There was nothing in this novel that could have stood by itself.  It was all in the characters.  Miller tells the story of a large Chicago family from the late 1940's to the 1980's.  Although this book is described as a family whose lives focus around the autistic son, I felt as though it was more about everyone else.  Miller lets us into the lives of all of the family, from the parents to the children.  It seems to linger more on those who are deeply effected by the happenings within the family, and leaving some as intimate outsiders.<br />Although there isn't a huge plot, just the going's on of a family, I flew through this book.	2002-08-18

And it wasn't the boring kind I had in school.  It was riveting and quite detailed.  The life of an early 20th century geisha was labor intensive.  I was shocked to read how much training and skill goes into these women, and that most of the time these women do not voluntarily train.  This was the case for the character we delve into, Sayuri.<br />Just a poor fisherman's daughter from a small village, Sayuri (not her given name) is sold to an okiya at the age of nine.  Her days are torture, from why all of these things were occuring in her life to the treatment she endured for years from the people in her new life.  But then the winds change for her, and she becomes a geisha herself.  This however, is not all fun and games.  The reader follows her life througout the next twenty years or so.  The narration is full of metaphors, which adds to the feeling of hearing straight from a Japanese women's mouth.  The research involved in this novel must have been extensive, but well worth the authors (and readers) effort.<br />A great read you shouldn't miss.	2002-08-07

First off, what is with all the weird names?  (Min Foo, for example, nicknamed due to her &quot;slant, oriental&quot; eyes!  Cripes!)  And then the main character, Rebecca is on the edge of something decent and exciting, but never really makes it.  Instead we are dragged through her wishy-washy life and inability to capture her audience.<br />There are good points here, though.  SOme characters are quite likeable, like Poppy and Peter.

She is quite perceptive, if not overly contemplative when she meets and makes temporary friends with Nick and Alix.  Then she meets James, and things don't seem so gloomy for her, for now she has reason not to hurry the days away.<br />I think this is a great book for what it's worth.  Great literature minus a huge plot.  The author does a great job in making a memorable character without having the reading see her through countless events.	2002-07-15

In other words, Gemma and Esther's relationship was not what Esther was telling us.  In fact, both girls have two seperate realities as to the depth and understanding of their friendship.  The author weaves this message into quite a tale of travel, discovery, and tragedy. We are told the story of these two on a trip to India through Esther, who thinks of her self as a world traveler.  She takes along her childhood friend Gemma out of guilt.  They  meet up with other travelers, and so the story unfolds.  Esther ends up going back to England alone and distraught.  But the story doesn't end there, as Esther has to put closure to losing Gemma five years later.<br />This is a great read and quite entertaining.	2002-07-01

I wish I could say there was more to it than that.  I was severely disappointed with this book.  I think after reading the back cover it seemed interesting enough.  But when the story goes on and on about nothing really that striking, I kept wondering when it would ever end.  The writing was hoping to be humourous, but slightly missing the mark.  The foreshading was too obvious, and the characters stereotypical.  I think perhaps it would have been an ok read if there wasn't so much filler in between the story.  I couldn't make it to the end.  And I didn't care enough for wonder what happened with the characters.  There are better books out there about family relationships.	2002-06-20

And I thought that was going to be possible with the first few pages of reading about Jemima's life of the fat girl watching all the good looking thin girls get the world.  But after getting past that, it was quite entertaining.  However, do not expect great literature here, although not badly written.  This book turned out to be an amusing tale of a British gal who happens to love food for comfort.  She meets a Californian hunk online that wants to meet her, and so she and a colleage create &quot;JJ&quot;, the beautiful, skinny version of Jemima.  And sure enough, Jemima loses the weight, gets fashionable clothes and hair and takes off to meet the hunk.  Now we all now disaster will strike, as the lesson here is looks are not everything.  But who really cares when you're entertained by the read?  Of course it has a corny ending, but it wouldn't be right to send off Jemima back to her ugly duckling days, would it?<br />As far as the many comparisons to Bridget Jones, I must put my two cents in here.  Yes, they are both single British girls with the aversion to spin themselves a few holes.  But not once did I find Jemima insulting as I did with Bridget.  If you are weighing between the two, go for Jemima!	2002-05-29

However, the writing style is superb.  Right from the start I enjoyed Fowler's language.  But I couldn't grasp the story line.  I was never sure which direction we were headed, who the story would center, or even understand Lizzie's motivations.  She seemed so wish-washy.  I guess what this story boils down to is a spinster's life in 1890 San Francisco who is a treasurer of an orphanage.  Life is typical and boring until along comes the city's most mysterious woman to give her an orphaned child.  There is mystery regarding the woman, the child, and later her own family.  I did not think that these were well connected, although in fact it was.  And some things that had an air of mystery were seemingly very straight forward at the end (I don't like giving too much away).<br />This book was a fine read, however, don't go into it with high expectations.	2002-05-23

Good thing, too, since the way this book started and continued was unclear and somewhat twisted.  Without someone telling me that this involved incest and abuse within a family, I would have been wondering why they all seemed so weird.<br />Despite this, however, this was a great novel.  It was well plotted with many twists (who knew that Frances would do the things she did?) and was fascinating.  There is also a scene towards the end involving the death of James that screams \\"MOVIE SCENE!\\".  How I would love to see this played out on the big screen.<br />Read this book.  It's definately a page turner!	2002-05-11

And boy, did this book give you reasons it is not, and I'm not just talking nutritional value here.<br />I found this book fascinating for the detail was great, well researched, and given to the reader straight.  It was an eye opening book.  Who knew that due to the meat industry being run just by a few corporations, essentially we are eating the same meat from the same feedlots and slaughter houses whether we buy it at a fast food chain or the local supermarket, and perhaps even the nicer restaurants.  I also found some of the content appalling.  Cattle are fed cats, dogs, other cows, even old newspaper!  If this doesn't outrage you enough, just wait to you get to how these same meat conglomerates treat the low paid, low skilled employees of the slaughterhouses.<br />This book is insightful and unbelievable, and will make you question how the fast food giants sleep at night.	2002-05-05

Her writing style is above many other popular literary writers and her story lines well plotted.  However, none of the characters here pulled me into them, feeling for them or even caring enough as to what happened to them.  I felt as though I was hearing a story from someone who heard it from someone that thought it interesting enough to pass along to those who like to hear a good story.<br />Although the story focuses on Eliza Sommers, an abandoned baby who is taken in by an English family in Chile, we also get a lot of background on other characters such as Miss Rose and Tao Chi'en.  And there are many other people that come along the way in Eliza's journey to California that keep this book colorful.  This book is filled with prostitutes, outlaws, and the poor.  It weaves history into the plot without it becoming a history lesson.<br />I recommend this book, and look forward to reading others by this author.	2002-04-20

It is told through the narration of the same girl as an old woman, who comes back to the town and tells the story.  Also in this book is the story of a family in the area during the mid to late 1800's.<br />With out giving too much away, this story involves a wicked stepmother, a boy, a small town, and a ghost.  The narration was easy to read, although every once in a while I would find myself rereading a sentence or two because it seemed grammatically incorrect.  Also, it wasn't quite clear to me as to why this old woman returned to Maine in the first place.  She does mention she has to tell the story, but why? Is she dying?  Or is it something that she just has to do?  I am still not quite sure.<br />Some of the elements of the story are predictable, but it doesn't really matter since the characters are appealing and the story well written and thought out.	2002-03-16

I was riveted by the lives of these women, how they endured what was put upon them, and how the survived.  One thing that I kept doing was referring back to the family trees because it was hard to keep track who was who, particulary the white men who took up with these slave women.  Just be warned: the ending is a bit sad, but not in the traditional sense of sad endings.<br />Another great thing about this book was that the author included real photos of these people and other documents.	2002-03-16

I must start out by saying that what kept me reading this book was that I kept visualizing Somerville and other landmarks mentioned in this book since I live there.  However, this was really one of the most ridiculous stories/plots I have read in a long time.  (Come to think of it, I can't remember any.....)  Most of the time I felt like I was reading a Harloquin romance novel.  Although the idea of a 60 year old couple finding romance is nice, the cheesy narration seemed like it should have come out of a 16 year old.  The other characters had very little depth and seemed way too one or two dimentional.<br />I give this two stars for Somerville and it being written by a nurse.	2002-03-04

I have to say it was extremely simple reading; I zipped thru the pages quickly.  I am not sure if we are supposed to believe that Julie, a young woman who was assuming a role in her family that was not congruent with the times, turned into the little homemaker wife with Hank.<br />At times I didn't believe Julie would have thought the way she did in her situations, but at the same time I did feel for her.  She was so young and faced many challenges.  She annoyed me in her ways with Hank, making excuses for his behavior which is so typical of women that are abused.  And then she proved her strength again with birthing alone.<br />If you are looking for a light read, I recommend this.  Just beware you may not believe a lot of what is told.	2002-02-11

This novel is a lengthy drama of teenage life at it's worst (and finest, I suppose) in Victorian America and England.  The format is all in letters; Arabella writes to her trusty journal friend, and Aubrey to his grandmother.  Thrown into the mix is a few letters from friends.<br />Without giving too much away, we are introduced to Arabella, a young woman who is of high society but sees the folly of many of her counterparts. She is also a young woman of her own will and liberty and she is therefore looked down upon by her family.<br />And then we are swept to the good ol' South to house slave Aubrey.  He is enslaved not only in the traditional sense, but by his intelligence and own mother.<br />So the story unfolds, with a lot of background into these people.  Then the inevitable happens: Arabella and Aubrey meet, and the tale continues with many twists and turns.<br />This is a great novel, if not lengthy, and is easy to get into in many ways.  The historical aspect seems intact and true to reality, and the characters are believable and multi-dimentional.	2002-02-10

The story is told by an 18 year old widow and mother of two, however her voice seems to be from a woman much older.  The author does a wonderful job with the language, transporting the reader to the 1660's.  Never once did I question the authenticy and intelligence of the work, which is a hard thing to pull off in historical fiction.<br />Although the main character Anna is the narrator, we get more than just a glimpse into her life, but of the entire life of the village.  We see how the Plague destroys not just the physical lives of the ill, but the emotional well being of their family, friends, and neighbors.  And of course we see the destruction of the humanity.  If you are looking for a perfect ending, then I warn you that it took a twist that I found a bit off.  However, I guess that makes this a good ending in the fact that it was not anticipated.<br />I highly recommend this, and look forard to other novels by this author.	2002-01-07

This, one would think is a bad thing, but was a great way to pull the reader in.  What possibly more could happen to this young Londoner Mary Saunders?  The author deftly wrote scenes and descriptions to give the feeling around the characters and places.  I could very vivdly see the cellar apartment Mary lives in, the clothes they wore, her mother's horrible attitude.<br />In the following sections of the novel, we find out what happens to Mary in the streets of London.  At first Mary is repelled, but soon finds some comfort in being &quot;a girl of her own liberty&quot; along side her new friend Doll.  I felt some pity for Mary, as well as hoping she'd pull through, but as the novel went on, her motivations seemed more and more superficial.  The girl was a pure teenager: a clothes horse!<br />This book is a must read.	2001-10-31

She begins to tell of why she might &quot;croak&quot; and &quot;jerk&quot;, and then the story transistions into how this effects her life as a ten year old.  She is very realistically made fun of and treatly meanly by many.  However there are others who look past her spells as well.<br />The characters overall were well developed yet stereotypical.  Her grandparents were too forgiving and nice.  Couldn't they have at least once gotten upset with Icy's behavior?  I would have at least understood as to why one may get upset with a 10 year old swearig for what seems to be no apparent reason.  And her friend Miss Emily is the proverbial jolly fat person that doesn't seem to be bothered with others views of her.<br />The author tells a wonderful story of her first year at school with her spells.  And then it goes down hill.  Icy is then thrown through several years quickly in the book, and the end comes with a too quick acceptance of herself.  The saving religion thrown in at the end was a bit too much for me to believe.  Even in the early 1960's I highly doubt that a teen girl would quickly &quot;convert&quot; to finding grace and acceptance in a spiritual revival that she originally didn't want to be caught dead at.  The ending seemed too much like a quick fix for the main character, leaving the reader to wonder why a teen would suddenly just love herself practically overnight?<br />I would recommend this book, just be wary of the ending.	2001-10-20

It was interesting to read the author's actual experiences living the way millions of Americans live.  However, her experience was biased and just a sampling of what it is really like.  The author did not have to go &quot;undercover&quot; to tell us that it really stinks to live this way.  Her evalution was poor on the fact that, again, did not give the reader much more to ponder.  She did give us some numbers to support her obvious claims, but I was disappointed with this aspect of the book.<br />If you are not looking for an in-depth investagative piece on this topic, then you will enjoy it for what it is worth: a bunch of little stories about working minimun wage jobs.	2001-10-12

The beginning was terribly boring and wasn't quite sure where it was going.  So I put it down, read a different book and came back.  I skipped much of the prelude, which was very self indulgent on the writer's part.  And it got going well from there.  I liked these characters and their stories of love.  I enjoyed their plights, thoughts, and feelings.  I liked how each one wanted love, and tried hard to get it/keep it/sustain it.  Although each character could stand on it's own, each was intertwined in some way.<br />The one character that I thought was the least believable was Chole, the young 16 year old.  Her speach was immature, yet her insight profound.  Perhaps this was done on purpose, but I just kept saying in the back of my head: &quot;Is this girl believable?&quot;<br />Give this one a try.  You will like the meat, just not the bread of this book.	2001-10-11

There was more to meets the eyes with Manson, and so when his book came out, I snatched it up.<br />Sure enough, this was a great chronicle of his life and how he became who we all see today.  He debunks what his critics and vehement opposers say of him being an antichrist.  He says he just shows people how he views the world by his music and concerts/performances.  In other words, he's imitating society and showing us what we are like when it boils down to society's morals vs. its actions.  He is our collective reflection.<br />In this book we see that Manson is intelligent, thoughtful, and yes, strange.  But I urge all of those who see him as satanic to read this book and appreciate this man's work.	2001-09-19

Although I am not a practicing Wiccan, I kept this book for furture reference.<br />This book goes into some history, the basis of witchcraft, and how to cast spells.  Cabot explains how to use Wicca in every day life, which some I use: placing crystals to enhance energy, etc.  She also touches upon enhancing your own psychic energy.  It was truly a good read, even for those just wanting to learn more about the religion but not to practice.  Would work well as a simple reference too.	2001-09-19

Enter a woman he falls for, the teen age girl that falls for him, and trouble ensues.  Many of the turns to this novel are predictable: the townspeople reaction to Jack, Addie letting go of her daughter, Jordan and Selena, etc.  There was some foreshadowing of things not spelled out, such as the relationship with Gillian and her father Amos.<br />Being somewhat educated in the area of Wicca, I felt that Picoult gave this religion a fair representation.	2001-09-18

It is a wonderful tale of several people: a husband and wife (Cam and Allie) whose lives are infiltrated with other characters: Jamie, Maggie, and Mia. I found that the people in this book were real, their thoughts, feelings and actions the same as many of us in our own lives. Throughout this book, I was finding myself feeling for Allie. I imagine many married woman feel and act this way.... however, Mia, I felt, had been an exception to the rule of &quot;the other woman&quot;. She had too much insight into who she was, what she wanted. I enjoyed these people very much, despite the things they were doing. One of the things that I found could have been excluded was the bit about Cam being the leader of the present day Carrymuir, the small town of Wheelock. This was a bit corny, but I suppose that the author felt this helped the readers understanding of Cam. I think this book has a little bit for everyone: romance, marital affairs, legal action, murder. You will find yourself staying up late to get to the next parts.... trying to figure out what has happened next.	2001-08-28

This collection of Maupin's first three novels of his Tales series is wonderful!

There may not be great plots or &quot;conflict&quot; like other novels in this book, but just several people living their lives.  These characters could be anyone, and as I kept reading found that they probably would be people I'd want as friends/neighbors if they were real.  Maupin weaves in pop culture and current events (now history since this starts in the 1970's) to make this all the more realistic.  This is a collection that can be read over and over... you will never get bored of it!	2001-08-20

I also liked the fact that this book was close to 700 pages which meant it would keep me busy.  And yes it certainly kept me busy..... it took me two months to get thru this treacherous piece of &quot;literature&quot;.  I found all the little details of the hydroelectric power plants boring and uninteresting.  I didn't see the point of all the details when the story just boiled down to romance (which never works out anyhow!).  I did like some of the historical characters in this novel and how the author portrayed them.  I also thought that other details of the time period were accurate and brought the reader to feel as though they were living then as well.  But overall, this novel feel short of my expectations. Louisa thought of herself as an independant woman of her day, but in actuality she was no different than the other married women of her time: sheltered and protected.  There are definately better historical novels out there.	2001-08-20

This book was about a few people who had some sort of connection to each other but not in a direct way.  The characters were not quite as interesting as they were destitute in some fashion.  For instance, Victoria has no family or support, Guthrie has no romantic love, Ike and Bobby have no parental supervision, the McPherons have no life outside of farming.  It goes from there.  At times I wondered where the story was going... at others I wondered when it would end. I found the most interesting parts involving Victoria and the McPherons.  Their relationship was heart warming; the men were very loving in their own way.  The one thing I definately liked was the narration.  There wasn't the standard quotation marks around the characters dialoge.  This made me think it was a story told by some one who was told by someone else and is just repeating it.  An interesting view of narration.	2001-08-19

It answered all my questions (and more!) about the industry and how to go about every aspect of getting published.  It was very helpful, a great resource to anyone who wants to be published.  It covers what to do for nonfiction and fiction in terms of proposals, etc.  The side bars on every page hold little tid-bits of useful info and publishing lingo.  This is a book I will refer to frequently.  If you are wondering why you aren't getting any agent interests or publishing contracts, you will probably find out why in this book.	2001-08-14

I couldn't get past the first 75 pages if that.  I found this horribly depressing.  Not necessarily a badly written novel, but it is so saddening tha I just could pull myself through this book.  The main character is obviously from page one depressed and hugely disapointed with her life.  And it just gets worse from there.  I still have this book (book mark and all!) on the shelf in hopes that maybe I will feel up to this book. The premise of the book seems good and this is why I am holding on to it.  I supoose if I run out of other books to read, this will makes its way off the shelf.	2001-08-01

I was not particularly thrilled with others of hers, but this was a great read!  I found some of the ending a bit hard to believe, but for the most part seemed real.  I have no idea what it must be like for a young girl to lose her mother this way, or any way for that matter.  But Berg made it feel real, the girls pain very real, and how they dealt with it.  It made me grateful for the wonderful mother I have.  Read it and love your mother for everything!	2001-08-01

But this can't be true, I think, since I am one of these &quot;single women&quot;.  I read this years ago, before the hype of the movie, etc.  And I was thoroughly disgusted with Bridget's behaviour and priorities.  Is this how society views us unmarried women?  I hope maybe this is not really true.  Please tell me so!!  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.	2001-08-01

I am surprised that people think this is a knock-off.  Not because the was a great and original story, but because it was so poor one would have thought a knock off from a classic would have be better.  Anyhow, I didn't like this book at all... every character horrible.  The scenes provided nothing but doom and gloom.  This was cast somewhere in Mass, which I despised her using my great state for such a horrible peice of &quot;work&quot;.  If you have to read this, don't bother buying it.  Save your money and go to the library.	2001-07-29

However, the story is great coming from the eyes of the midwife's child.  As an obstetrics nurse, I found myself taking a stand on what was happening in this book.  As a &quot;medical&quot; professional, I could see the debate of the MD's and such not liking country midwives practicing with no formal medical or nursing training.  But because I am a nurse, and feel as though nurses have a more human aspect to caring (not curing as MD's do), I can see these midwives care as great in compassion and experience.  So I was surprised at the ending....  read this!	2001-07-27

I read this book on a whim of Anita Shreve, since I loved Pilots Wife and Fortunes Rocks.  However, I can not be as enthusiastic with the book.  What kept me reading was Maren, whose narrative was intriguing and in depth.  Her affection for her brother and disaffection for her husband was one for the ages.  The scenes made me feel the darkness of her Isle of Shoals home.  The ending of Maren's story was great, but the other woman (which was so memorable that I forgot her name) was dull and boring.  It was obvious that woman, where the story opens with, is straight out depressed and miserable.  I would have given this 5 stars plus if it wasn't for the miserable wife of an alcoholic.  Her husband happens to be the man that her latest The Last Time They Met is in, whic I refuse to read because he is so repulsive.	2001-07-27

If you check out my other recommendations/reviews you will find that recently I was on a Shreve kick.  However, the further I got into her novels, the more depressing and untolerable they became.  This has got to be the worst of all.  Charles opens the story and goes on about his financial ruin and poor family/marital status.  And it just gets worse from there.  I picked this one because it was two lost loves reunited, which is always nice, but in this case, I felt ripped off and cheated out of some sense of contentment.  (I won't even mention happiness because it isn't in this book.)  If you are looking for tradgedy and a weight of doom to follow you a few days after you finish this, then by all means hurry and read this one!	2001-07-27

I felt as though I waited for years (I think at least one!) for this book to come out.  All the waiting had me expecting the best written novel ever from him.  However, I cannot narrow down just one above his others, I still was not disappointed at all with this story.  I liked the air of suspense, the novel ending without a &quot;real ending&quot;, which others seem to be looking for.  It was obvious that this was modeled about himself which I liked.  It made me wonder if something like this really happened to him?  Hmmmm...<br />I recommened reading all of his novels, starting with the tales, then going onto Maybe the Moon, then this latest.  You will appreciate his works if you read them in the order he has written them.	2001-07-25

I still would not have known if there wasn't conterversy regarding the content at a local high school here.  I found this book taking me to my &quot;cool days&quot; when there was a group of friends that meant everything, and did everything with.  What made it more memorable was that Charlie is exactly my age, and that it took place at the same time I had a special group of friends that all thought we were &quot;infinite&quot;.  This was very fulfilling.  I recommended this to anyone who has a group of friends from your coming of age years that you will never forget, even if you aren't friends with them anymore.<br />The characters were well developed and believeable.  The whole time I knew there was something more to Charlie, and was happy to read the explaination at the end.	2001-07-25

He writes a great story, dropping subtle and not so subtle hints about a small person and their struggles in Hollywood.  I was amazed at his detail, and how much it was believable.  I constantly was thinking back to 1981, when I was 5 and watching a very famous movie!  This was great.  Makes me want to reread this book again.  (the first time was 1998 and I still remember this book in great detail!)	2001-07-25

There wasn't much action or conflict other than Griet becoming a maid.  However, her narration was compelling and story enjoyable.  The one thing I would tell those who are looking for a thorough historical fiction peice is that this is not for you.  Although it took place in the 1660's, there was nothing to distinguish this from say the 1760's or even the 1860's.  But if you are looking for a light hearted novel about a young girl and how she draws people to her, then this is the book for you.	2001-07-24

If every word was based on Sidda, I would not have been able to finish this book.  I found Sidda whiney, looking to blame her mother for her hesistancy to commit to relationships.  However, I at first didn't like Vivi either, but as her story came out, I grew to like her very much.  I felt compassion for her and her struggles in trying to be the &quot;good girl&quot;, the &quot;popular girl&quot;, the &quot;good wife&quot;, and the &quot;good mother&quot;. the other thing that threw me was how southern it was, being such a Yankee through and through. Bring on more Vivi, but please leave out her daughter!  Or maybe a book delving into the other Ya-Ya's?	2001-07-24
