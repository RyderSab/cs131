I recently wrote a review of Guilty Pleasures, the first volume in this Anita Blake series. I said it was great while waiting for the next Harry Dresden volume by Jim Butcher, or that of the Angel (tv vampire detective--#3 on--Not Forgotten (#2) by Holder is harder to read and should be saved for when you are out of other books) paperbacks. I thought nothing would be as breath-taking as Fool Moon by Butcher (Harry Dresden is like a grown up Harry Potter in a setting similar to Anita Blake's).<br />But Laughing Corpse was a real roller-coaster ride-- Some series are not to be read late at night alone because they are too frightening. This series is also not to be read then because you'll stay up all night and maybe ruin your work day the next day. I still cannot say anything is greater than Fool Moon but this series is now WAY UP there. And don't miss Naked Came the Sasquatch by John Boston, Virtual Girl by Amy Thomson, Shadows Fall by Simon Green, or the works of Jefferson Swycaffer!	2001-12-24

I have just finished the only three books in the Harry Dresden series by Jim Butcher. Imagine a tough detective like Matt Scudder [by Lawrence Block], but as played by a grown up Harry Potter. I am also up to date on the excellent recent novels (#3 on) of the series of paperbacks based on ANGEL, tv's vampire detective. Thus, I tried this first book in the famous Anita Blake series. It was a bit more for female readers, with some<BR>of its irresistible looking male characters, but as time goes by, I bet I like it as much, or almost as much, as Jim Butcher's books; though I cannot imagine ANYTHING surpassing Butcher's &quot;Fool Moon.&quot;	2001-12-14

All of Swycaffer's books are great, some are classic pursuit novels like Universal Prey, Warsprite, etc. This, like some of his others, is one of a kind. You'll never forget it. I told people that at one point, 3/4ths of the way through this book, I had to hold it up in front of my face, as I read it at lunch at a fast food place, to hide the tears coming out of my eyes. They said &quot;Sounds like a sad, depressing book; won't try it.&quot; That's NOT why I was crying. I was moved, rewarded, what else can I say? It was NOT a depressing book.

I work in a library and our most informed patron of &quot;what a great story&quot; novels praised this as Orde's best book. But hardly anyone else read it because it was thick and long, _and_ it had the smallest sized print I ever saw in a paperback! And Orde's best audience are people who need LARGE PRINT to begin with. Some publisher would do well to reprint all of Orde's books in LARGE PRINT, even though they are LONG. And make them as light as possible for the arthritics who cannot handle heavy books!

I read all the other available Angel books, but could never get into this. I tried starting it several times. The beginning had too many original characters, too much confusing mixed mythology (and I have blood relatives in South East Asia so it is not a cultural bias I am talking about...). Finally I had finished Avatar and had no new Angel or Buffy or Sixth Sense novels to read ((The SIXTH SENSE books are for &quot;intermediate readers&quot; but are TERRIFIC and should not be missed. I am over 20 years old and I mean this.)) I tried once more to read NOT FORGOTTEN; it continued to be &quot;more work&quot; than the other novels in the series---but, you know what?, it did pay off. I would have preferred an easier read, but I was desperate and it DID give me an Angel reading experience, with much reward, when there was nothing else available. I'm glad of that.	2001-04-06

I interloaned the one large print book by Hensley, Robak's Fire, for a library user. She'd already read all the Grisham and other well-known bestselling legal thrillers. We got a regular print copy of Robak's FirM instead (note: one letter difference in title). Not the right novel and, besides, this particular Hensley book  was a collection of short stories! Who reads short stories now, I thought? Nobody. I reordered the correct book and opened Robak's FIRM. Hey, what if _I_ were to read one of these stories. I only read novels. But I tried one,and then another. What a fantastic experience. The author has a great reputation for writing legal thrillers equal to Grisham and the others, but is often overlooked in the crowd.

This is a terrific book on what it is like to be a sentient being. The main character is flooded by information, like all of us and has to learn to survive. After the first 100 pages there is a detour in the book's strength, in that secondary characters are introduced who are sexual minorities. There may have been a reason for this, but it was a minor distraction. I would recomend this book to fans of basically sentient characters (like Robocop), fans of pursuit/suspense (like Dean Koontz and Jefferson Swycaffer novels), and to readers interested in artificial intelligence or just the mystery of being alive. Whenever I feel down I pick up this book or Shadows Fall by Simon Green.  P. S.: I did not understand why the plot included that path (meeting sexual minorities). I think I do now as some readers told me that the main character was  one that some female readers thought should have advanced herself to represent women in society, as in breaking the glass ceiling.... Instead she took a Buddhist path of being a sentient being and listening to people and being compassionate. Her interaction with sexual minorities in the middle of the book shows that she is basically a non-sexual being and not bound to gender considerations, but to consideration of all humans and sentient beings.  Nothing wrong with fighting against the glass ceiling, it's just not THIS CHARACTER's main interest. I think. As shown above. Nopthing wrong with sexual minorities anywzy.	1997-11-01
