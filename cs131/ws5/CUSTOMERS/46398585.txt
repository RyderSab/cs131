Marnie has done a fabulous job of raising her orphaned teenaged nephew from the time David was just 4 years old. Suddenly David's father, someone Marnie's sister had a brief summer romance with 16 years earlier, appears on the scene, having recently discovered that he had a son and wanting to be a part of the boy's life. Law is a weathly and famous astronaut who can provide David with the material things Marnie can't. Marnie feels she can't compete with Law, however she's determined to fight him for the love and custody of the boy she's always considered to be her own. She doesn't approve of his bachlor lifestyle and believes he'll be a bad influence on David.  Adding intrigue and depth to the situation is the fact that Marnie had a childhood crush on Law the summer her sister was involved with him, and has never forgotten him. He remained the standard by which she measured new men into her life, and they all fell very short.<br /><br />Although a more dated, less polished Sandra Brown book, Long Time Coming packs a lot of punch as Marnie and Law come together to do what's best for David, merge their differing lifestyles and values, and deal with their feelings towards each other, and demonstrate that both are worthy of David's love and devotion.	2005-10-10

Camille has been hired to renovate the aging estate of an ailing and genteel gentleman, who wants to leave something welcoming and homey for future generations.  When she arrives at the mansion, she realizes that Zack, a man with whom she shared a vacation romance and night of passion 2 years earlier, is the heir.  Neither she nor Zack have been able to forget the other and move on in their respective love lives, but they need to resolve some misunderstandings before they can pick up where they left off.  The bickering and unnecessary nastiness in trying to put distance between themselves and the other turned me off a bit because I felt their reasoning for pushing the other away wasn't very believable and could have been handled more respectfully and more easily with better communication.  Yet, I still enjoyed the story because it was very cute and romantic.  Camille, Zack and all the secondary characters were very likable, especially in their compassion towards the ailing Rayburn.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this was Sandra Brown's very first novel.  Although not as polished as her more recent ones, there are flashes of her usual brillance in the colorful desciptions of the impressive antebellum plantation and the attention to detail given to Camille's restoration and redecoration project.	2005-10-09

The handsome, haughty British officer seemed to think that one stolen kiss would make her breathless.  Well, it did, but Gwyneth would sooner die than admit it.  Never had the British noblewoman dreamed that an innocent visit to American's Fort Detroit would take such a fateful turn.  And when Giles was chosen to escort her through the perilous wilderness to Montreal, Gwyneth knew her heart was in danger.<br /><br />What was a well-bred lady to do?  Battle his manly embraces with feminine wit and wiles?  Challenge his seductive words with sharp sallies?

The dashing British Lord had voyaged to America for only one reason; to acquire Diablo, the magnificent black stallion, for his famous Montgomery Stables in England.

To be honest, it took me longer than usual to read this book because it was quite hard for me to get into.  I love Jennifer Weiner's humorous style of writing, and for me, that's what carried this book.  Although I softened a bit to the characters in the end, they didn't endear themselves to me.  They were too Stepford-wife-ish and I couldn't form a connection to them or relate to them in any meaningful way, as I had in Jennifer Weiner's other books where the characters dealt with more familiar issues like body image struggles, relationships and family dynamics.<br /><br />I didn't care for the murder-mystery theme of this book, and there were too many unresolved issues in the end which makes much of Kate's efforts seem rather pointless, particularly her dissatisfaction in her relationship with Ben, who views her as \\"just a housewife in need of a hobby\\", and her feelings for Evan.	2005-10-05

She asked, but no one knew.  A near-fatal accident had stolen Jane's past, and now she struggled daily with her new life.  Only the knowledge that policeman Matt Sullivan was rooting for her kept her going.  But when flashes of her memory returned, Jane grew afraid she woudln't like the person she used to be...<br /><br />So, she turned once more to Matt.  Now a private detective, he vowed that this time, she'd discover the truth about Jane.  And this time, no one would be able to hurt her in mind or body because suddenly Matt was realizing that the new Jane was everything he'd dreamed of getting for Christmas.<br /><br />But could he keep her?<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />This is so much more than a run-of-the-mill Harlequin. It's an exciting crime-drama! The characters are strong and courageous in their determination to solve the mystery behind attacks on both of them. The plot is well-developed and highly engaging! The setting, San Francisco at Christmastime, particularly the large department store, provides an interesting backdrop for the story. Very nicely done!	2005-09-30
US	46398585	RM88MMMA0UB6Z	0345467566	62790053	When in Rome...	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Full of good humor - a fun read!	This book caught my attention because I am drawn to most novels set in Italy.  I relished in the touristy details of Rome, however it wasn't enough to sustain me.<br /><br />The film \\"Roman Holiday\\" is heavily reference and if one isn't familiar with this film, its relevance and symbolism would not be understood.<br /><br />Georgie was unbelievably naive and flaky - very reminiscent of Becky Bloomwood of the Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series.  It was very hard to like and respect Georgie, and I constantly wanted to shake some sense into her.  Kind-hearted and gentlemanly David was a gem, however he was far too trusting and passive in their relationship.  Mike was way too smooth and slippery - I can't believe Georgie couldn't see right through him, but I suppose it took another bad experience with Mike to make her appreciate David and the real relationship she had with him.<br /><br />What redeems this book and makes it worthwhile is that it's very humorous, witty, fun and fast-paced.  Its light-hearted tone signals that the story is intended to be entertaining rather than seriously analyzed.  If read with that mindset, the book achieves this purpose fabulously.	2005-09-29

The characterizations and details are brilliantly presented, and it was very interesting to read about a conflict of this nature from a compassionate male's point-of-view.  I loved and admired Griffin, especially in his interactions with Zoe. The bits where he played the shopping-mall Santa exposed a wonderfully tender and nurturing side.  However, I found Ellen to be such a mousy, cold, selfish and overall unlikable person that I couldn't imagine that Griffin would want to continue a life with her or be open to forgive and trust her again.  In my mind, he was far too patient and tolerant of her affair and her accusations against him. She closed off her feelings and emotions, and didn't express her needs to Griffin over the years, and then blamed him for taking her for granted and neglecting her.  It seemed to me that she was the unappreciative and negligent one who didn't deserve a second chance with him.  Quite a few times, I found myself wondering why they didn't try family counseling, if only for the sake of Zoe.<br /><br />Although the story is considered to have a happy ending, I would have felt more satisfied if this conflict had been resolved differently.  Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it was fast-paced, well-written, deep, introspective and thought-provoking.	2005-09-24

But the latest hire at Bob's and Bart's Auto Repair could recognize a faulty coil in no time and fix it just as fast.  Only problem was that Bob Delanio was attracted to his new employee.  Luckily, he knew business and pleasure didn't mix.  Besides, after meeting her weathy and controlling father, Bob realized he and Georgette came from opposite worlds.  It was up to Georgette to she her handsome boss that a downtown man should take a risk on an uptown girl.<br /><br />*************************<br /><br />One of reasons I enjoy the Love Inspired books is that they showcase solid and wholesome values. In His Uptown Girl, the moral is that people's worth should be judged on the type of person they are on the inside, and not on how much money or flashy positions they have. Although I liked the story very much, it is a bit heavy on the preachiness. I didn't give it a higher rating because I prefer Christian fiction that's more subtle in sharing its message.<br /><br />The cliche that money cannot buy happiness certainly holds true in Georgette's life. As the heiress to her family's business empire, she never lacked for material comforts. Yet, she was never permitted by her controlling father to be her own person, to go to college and develop her interests or knowledge, to have any close friendships, to venture outside their social circle, to belong to a church (because God is for weaklings). To cope with feelings of insecurity and loneliness, Georgette developes an interest in rebuilding car engines, a hobby which leads her to apply for a mechanic/bookkeeping job at a local auto shop.  This job, and her friendship with her boss Bob, becomes a secret she can only keep from her father for a few months. Once he discovers that she defied him, he issues her an ultimatum: either save the family's reputation she's disgraced and marry a man of his choosing or he will disown her. This is the last straw for Georgette - she refuses to marry a man she doesn't love, or remain a part of a lifestyle that goes against so many of her beliefs, her feelings of self-worth, and her pursuit of inner joy.<br /><br />When her father follows through with his threat, Georgette find herself without any money, a home, or anyone to lean on for support. Her boss, Bob, who had become her only good friend, gives her a place to live and teaches her some of the basic household tasks, like cleaning and cooking, that she was never allowed to do for herself before.

A cultured east-coast woman travels to the untamed west and hooks up with a roughened mountain man, and the unlikely couple must find common ground before they can find love. What set this story apart was the beautiful way it was written. The romance came alive off the pages, and Buck's tenderness and vulnerability really shone through. There was a bit too much unnecessary verbal sparring and I could have done without the detailed descriptions of his hunting/skinning work, but all-in-all it was an enjoyable story.	2005-09-21

Who would think of offering Estelle a romantic sleigh ride?<br /><br />TAKE ME HOME is Kathleen's one request. Undertaking her first teaching position away from home might have been a mistake. How can she have a real Christmas without the holiday preparations with her family, traditions of get-togethers and sleigh rides???<br /><br />Will these women wither in self-pity this Christmas or open their hearts to the unexpected? Can they renew their faith in the true meaning of the season?<br /><br />**************<br /><br />Although written by different authors, the second story is a follow-up to the first one. Set in post-Civil War times, these heartwarming tales of wounded souls and frozen hearts that find healing and thawing through love and friendship have a Little House on the Prairie or Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman feel to them. It's refreshing to read romances involving mature, older characters. This book is Christian fiction, which isn't noted on the cover or in the product description. At times, the stories become quite preachy, but for the most part, they are simply about faithful people on a spiritual journey, without being too intrusive or overwhelmingly religious.	2005-09-21

Charlotte has been widowed for 7 years and is about to become engaged to a safe and steady man who is a sharp contrast to the rogue she impetuously married when she was only 18 years old. Imagine her surprise when Hugh returns! He wasn't dead, but merely suffering from amnesia caused by war injuries. He claims to have changed, and so has she. Can they recapture their love, or is it time for them to move on? This is a sweet story, but not very believeable or convincing. Charlotte's two widowed friends are introduced, and it would have been nice to learn what happens to them too.<br /><br />Much Ado About Twelfth Night by Liz Carlyle: 92 pages.

When shrewd and ruthless Erasmus died seven years later, he stipulated in his will that Genevieve must marry one of his business partners after a two year mourning period in order to inherit his estate. Upon hearing that Genevieve was now a widow, Tobias returned from India, where he had retreated to soothe his wounds and make his fortune after being jilted. Genevieve had her sights set on marrying the snake-like Felton to fulfill her husband's will, however how could she resist the charm and passion of her first and only true lover?<br /><br />Nightingale by Cathy Maxwell: 73 pages.

Based on my (admittedly limited) previous experience with Lori Foster's books, I was expecting another light-hearted and funny basic chick-lit story. Wow - did this book deliver so much more than that, with a deep story of substance!<br /><br />Cyn admirably escapes a childhood of neglect and abuse by running away at age 17. She survives the next five years supporting herself the only way she knows how - by selling her body. With fierce determination, she saves enough money within 5 years to move to small-town North Carolina and reinvent herself, find an honest job, become a productive member of society, make friends and fall in love with the town's understanding and nonjudgmental preacher. Her relationship with Bruce is threatened because it's difficult for her to trust any man, and she feels unworthy of the love of a good man. Cyn's abuser eventually catches up with her, and starts stalkin, threatening and tormenting her. With the love and support of Bruce, and the protection of the entire community, including a mysterious clairvoyant character, Cyn finally finds safety and much deserved happiness.	2005-09-09

She felt obligated to keep up family's historic house, even though it was draining her financially, because it was her daughter's heritage.  Now that Debbie was getting married and moving to Colorado, Lauren was facing empty-nest syndrome.  For the first time in her life, she can follow her heart and live for her dreams, if only she could figure out in what direction to go.<br /><br />As Micah was approaching 50, he began to re-evalute his vagabond lifestyle as a world-renouned photojournalist.  He felt it was time to settle down and make a permanent home for himself, but the prospect of no longer being free to roam the earth at will frightened him.  Testing the waters, he takes on a smaller, less adventurous, project photographing antebellum homes as he considers accepting professorship at the local College.<br /><br />There is definite chemistry between the two, and it is refreshing that they address the issues and conflicts that separate them in a loving, caring and spiritual way.  Detailed descriptions of Micah's travels, the historic homes and churches involved in his project, Laurel's restoration of her home, and preparations for Debbie's wedding add depth and color to the story.<br /><br />There is a suspenseful subplot, as Laurel receives threatening messages by someone who is trying to spook her out of the house.  As well, the man who supposedly died with her husband 20 years ago resurfaces, and Micah and Laurel go on an adventure to Venezuela to investigate whether or not her husband is also still alive.<br /><br />Lauren is a woman of great faith, and her supportive church family and prayer are important parts of the story.  Although a believer, Micah makes a deeper spiritual journey and commitment as his relationship with Laurel unfolds and he becomes more involved in the church community.  The inspirational message is presented gently and is not at all intrusive or preachy.  Very well written, with impeccible attention to plot development and descriptive details.urch family and prayer are important parts of the story.

I am a huge fan of Christian fiction that's subtle and realistic, but this book was so heavy-handedly preachy that I found myself feeling turned off to the message rather than feeling inspired by it. The numerous \\"coincidences\\" were far too convenient to make attributing them all to God's Will convincing or believable. The community members were too goody-goody to be true, and there seemed to be no transitional phase between their \\"old\\" wayward lives and how they just jumped right into their \\"new\\" life doing the work of God as though by miraculous transformation. Not very relistic or easy to relate to. The unnatural dialogue came across as corny, bordering on ridiculous, and it became very irritating that every sngle conversation over 240 pages was scripture or praise oriented. Definitely overkill.<br /><br />It's unfortunate because this storyline and unlikely heroine had a tremendous amount of potential. Its intended message of redemption, grace and forgiveness would have been more readily received had it been presented in a more subtle and realistic manner - perhaps in the style of Beverly J. Scott, Jan Karon, Thomas Kinkade, etc.	2005-09-03

An engrossingly interesting story of three siblings, who were considered outcasts while growing up, and their attempt to revive the family business and restore the family's reputation in the quaint Cape Cod community with the help of some old friends and not-so-good friends.  In order to accomplish this goal, they need to confront and resolve the issues of their past, and handle new wrenches thrown their way, including solving a crime that occurred on their property and was recently discovered, threatening to destroy all their efforts.<br /><br />I would have given this a higher rating, but I wasn't convinced that Ken and the Shore siblings came to their crime-solving conclusions based on the evidence their sleuthing came up with. It just seemed to easy that they figured it all out correctly when it wasn't the obvious or typical response. As well, only 2 of the 3 siblings find happiness in the end, and it was unsatisfying that one remained hurting without closure and a happy ending too.  I didn't guess who the murderer was (although the victim was obvious from the start).<br /><br />Ken is a gem! A sturdy rock for Laura to lean on! What a wonderful, down-to-earth man, who was willing to go against popular opinion and believe the best about people, and would go through great lengths to support them. As well, the initial lovemaking scene between Ken and Laura started off wonderfully, but sort of fell apart in a very unsatisfying fashion.	2005-08-31
US	46398585	R2HGE2QBPK9YGM	0373707851	965129402	Reluctant Witness	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Outstanding	I have been making a conscious effort move away from series romances, but I love books set in the Amish world, so I couldn't resist this one. I had recently finished Beverly Lewis's powerful Abram's Daughters series, and was feeling an emptyness and sadness about closing the door on the family that had become dear to me through those 5 books. While this is not an esteemed Beverly Lewis book, it is a very good representation of the inner struggles Amish women face.<br /><br />Sarah, a young widow, was raped, yet her father and her Bishop forbid her from testifying against her attacker because it's not the Amish way to go outside their cloistered community, nor to involve themselves in the \\"Englishers\\" justice system. Yet, she couldn't find peace within herself after being violated in this intensely private way, especially considering how modest Amish women are taught to be. Allowing her attacker to roam freely meant that she and other women couldn't go about their everyday life feeling safe.<br /><br />Sarah is torn between obeying her bishop simply because she was expected to or doing what she knows in her heart is right, testifying in court and risk being shunned and losing contact with her family/friends. What she hadn't counted on was falling in love with the Englisher prosecuter, which further complicated her decision. They are from two very different worlds - how can they find a compromise which would allow them to make a life together?<br /><br />This was more than a romance novel, it was a cultural experience and a story about a woman breaking from tradition and being true to herself.	2005-08-30

Told from the refreshing viewpoint of a delightfully introspective and creatively expressive young girl who has the artistic soul of a poet, the story resonates with lessons of adolescence (and even adulthood) that I certainly relate too.<br /><br />I enjoyed this follow-up story to Durable Goods and Joy School immensely, however it was really another chapter in the life of Katie rather than a conclusion to the series. There are still many loose ends and I am left wanting more, wondering how Katie and the supporting characters will continue on their journey and what will become of them all.

Only 150 pages and easily read in a few hours, this book packs a lot of punch. With its many hilarious moments, I'd almost categorize it as chick-lit rather than a run-of-the-mill romance novel. Family dynamics (mother-daughter between Meg and Lindsey and sister-brother between Steve and Nancy, as well as the friendship between Lindsey and Brenda) give this story additional depth.<br /><br />Fifteen year old Lindsey decides that her divorced mom has been single and lonely for far too long. Problem is, Meg isn't interested in dating again. With the help of her friend, Lindsey concocts an elaborate plan to change Meg's mind, starting with a diet, exercise and fashion makover. Pretending to be Meg, they place a personal ad and carry on a correspondence with Steve. However, it isn't Steve replying to their letters, it's his meddlesome sister Nancy who is likewise trying to fix him up.<br /><br />The chemistry is electrifying when Meg and Steve meet, but they are so furious at the way they've been manipulated by their families that they decide to teach them a lesson. Meg pretends to be a trashy woman of ill-repute when she meets Nancy, and Steve pretends to be an ex-con when he meets Lindsey. This all backfires when Meg and Steve fall in love and cannot convince their families that they aren't really the raunchy characters they presented themselves as. Establishing trust and gaining the acceptance of their families is further complicated by some very funny mishaps.	2005-08-29

I loved the chemistry between Leah and Ethan.  The relationships each had with Tom (Ethan's father) and Holly (Ethan's daughter) were very well-developed.

Widowed Abby and journalist Dylan came into their arrangement for him to live on her farm while he wrote an authorized biography about her late husband with negative preconceived notions about the other.  Although they were totally prepared to hate each other, what puts this story notches above most other romance novels is that they treated each other with respectful tolerance and acceptance rather than hostile animosity. There was none of that annoying bickering and put-downs, but rather a desire to uncover the truth and understand each other.

Gwen immediately responded to Luke with undeserved harsh animosity, judging him without knowing anything about him or having the facts straight. Gwen was so quick to assume the worst about him (she was also too quick to have sex with him, especially while proclaiming to dislike him so much).

Donovan's come-ons were far from subtle and the teasing went way beyond humorous - it was pushy almost to the extent of stalking or forcing himself on Liz. And the painful secret that has Liz scared to death of any sexual intimacy is so obvious to the reader, and it should have been to Donovan too. The first 100-125 pages were a struggle to get through. However, the story did improve by leaps and bounds once Liz revealed her secret to Donovan, and he became patient, tender and understanding.

There are flashes of Nora Roberts brilliance in the detailed descriptions of the beautiful Hawaiian scenery, in particular when Laine and Dillon are snorkling in the reefs. However, the story is very weak. The dynamics of Laine's troubled relationship and subsequent reconciliation with her father is poorly developed. Dillon is so abrasively hostile towards Laine that it is impossible to believe that she ever falls in love with him - there is nothing at all likable about him except maybe his brooding good looks. The dialogue between them is painfully unbearable to read because it flows so unnaturally and unrealistically. Even the housekeeper, who is supposed to be a ally, isn't presented in a favorable manner.

Deeply developed characters, a familiar setting, and very detailed (and seemingly accurate) glimpse into what neighborhood life was like on suburban Long Island 45 years ago, and how it compares to my own lifestyle here now. I definitely felt drawn into the community and related to the characters as though they were my own neighbors.	2005-08-21
US	46398585	R37NK3N3GKDD0Q	0425146812	973741649	Second Nature	Books	4	2	3	N	N	an intriguing story	Alice Hoffman's books are darker and weirder, and her writing style is much different, than my usual reading preferences. Initially, I was drawn to her books because Long Island is the setting, or Long Island references are incorporated into many of her novels. I quickly became spellbound by her books!<br /><br />Although it's hard to imagine that a single mother would take an undomesticated man into her household, the story had sort of a Jungle Book or \\"My Fair Lady\\" feeling to it. Stephen was raised by wolves in the wild and the way he communed with nature and utilized his survival skills was fascinating! Robin was a compassionate and likeable woman, and the chemistry between the two sizzled! Supporting characters added color and depth to the story. The killings were kind of gruesome, but the reader knows Stephen wasn't responsible even though he is the likely suspect, and it wasn't difficult to guess who the killer was.	2005-08-21

Sophy's self-depricating manner of handling her issues of not living up to her parents's expectations and rebelling against all things academic grew tiresome very quickly. That Max took advantage of her when she was most vulnerable seemed terribly out-of-character for him, and tarnished his image and his likability in my eyes. The resulting conflict and bickering that ensued between them was so awful it became almost unbearable to read. The same storyline could have been presented so much better, which would have turned this into a very sweet and realistic feel-good romance, rather than something that was an unsatisfying struggle to muddle though.	2005-08-21

I enjoyed accompanying Kathryn on her amazing journey to uncover exactly why her husband died in such a horrible crash, the graceful way she handled the intrusive media and the compassion she showed to her grieving daughter, as well as to Muerie and her children.<br /><br />I was fascinated to read in the author's notes that the setting is based on an actual house she saw in Maine and couldn't get out of her mind, and that she set two of her other stories, Sea Glass and Fortune's Rock, in the same house but during different times in history, because a long standing house has more than one story to tell.	2005-08-21

The Victorian dialect and slang used was much harder to understand compared to other Victorian Romances I've read.<br /><br />The story is very reminiscent of \\"My Fair Lady\\".  The Earl takes a lowly wife and teaches her to be a lady, while she teaches him lessons of her own about love and family.

I found it difficult to get through, mostly because it wasn't believeable and the dialogue was so unnatural. I had a hard time looking at it superficially. A clairvoyant mother-daughter duo hooks up with a documentary producer who wishes to portray them in the most positive light possible. The mother is very likable, but the daughter is so prickly and hostile that it is hard to imagine the sympathetic producer becoming interested in her. I have to admit to skimming through the last half of the story because I couldn't bear reading it any further that I already had but I needed to satisfy my curiosity as to whether the story got any better and satisfy my need to know how it ended. The subject matter was interesting and unique enough that the story had great potential if only it had been better developed and was well-written.	2005-08-21

While she was there she fell in love with the wide-open spaces, the country air, and the lifestyle on the Wyoming ranch. She wanted to remain in Wyoming permanently, but what made it impossible to stay was that she also fell in love with the rancher next-door. She thought he was committed to a more sophisticated woman, and she couldn't bear to stay while he made a homelife with someone else, so she decided to leave as soon as possible.  It's hard to imagine that someone as strong and as self-sufficient as Samantha would walk away from the challenge of another woman being interested in the man she loved.<br /><br />One thing I find very annoying in romance novels is incessant and unnecessary bickering between the characters, supposedly representing sexual tension or a conflict. Samanatha started off as a giving and unselfish woman, yet I was immediately turned off by her antagonistic and hostile reaction to Jake. Yes, he was very flirtatious, but definitely not the arrogant condescending playboy he is made out to be, and Samantha seemed to overreact in such a silly negative way to his charm. In the end, Jake became quite aggresive in his pursuit of her, but quite frankly it was a welcome break in the plot, and the only way he'd get through to her stubborness and they'd finally come together and resolve the conflict.	2005-08-21

I recently relished reading Anne River Siddons' The House Next Door, and have thoroughly enjoyed other books she's written. As an Italian-American, I can't resist books that are set in Italy, and reviews have described this book as a travelogue through the hills of Tuscany. I suppose my expectations were very high for an \\"Under The Tuscan Sun\\"-like novel written by an author whose style I admire and appreciate.<br /><br />I picked this book up three times, tried moving onto other reading material and returning to it afterwards, hoping I'd be in a different mindset and could open up to it better, but this novel simply wasn't going to make its way into my heart despite having so much promise.<br /><br />The two main characters were quite weird, and not very likeable. The book opens in a university town in the mountains of Tennessee, with an agorophobic heroine who won't leave the hill on which she lives. Eventually, with therapy she is able to take a trip to Italy with her husband. The dynamics of these characters and their relationship is too intense. What saves the novel is the luscious settings, which the author succeeds in describing in vivid detail.<br /><br />Still, I found the book so oppressingly boring that I had to quit reading about 1/2 of the way through, and just skimmed through to the end. The couple had a blind daughter, who was briefly mentioned in the opening chapters - now that's a storyline that should have been developed better. It would have been fascinating to learn how a mother who is afraid to leave her community raises a blind child into a well-rounded, quite normal adult.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a huge disappointment, although it can't be said that I didn't try my best to appreciate it.	2005-08-21

Love developes very predictably between a private duty nurse and the angry bitter accident victim she is helping to overcome his physical handicap as well as his bad attitude. She causes conflict where there is none, fearing that she doesn't fit into the world he left behind after his accident and that once he walks again, he will leave her to return to that lifestyle. But the accident has shifted his priorities and her fears are unwarrented.<br /><br />Kind of disappointing for a Debbie Macomber book, which usually have more deeply developed characters and settings, as well as storylines. Not up to par with her more recent books.	2005-08-21

I absolutely loved it - an entracing page-turner. It was more about community and neighborhood friendships than spooky, and I wish I lived on the same street with these wonderfully developed characters, especially Colquitt.<br /><br />My only criticism was that the ending was a bit rushed and vague considering all the vivid details that bought the reader to that point. After immersing myself in this novel and almost becoming a part of this neighborhood myself, it would have been nice to have the loose ends tied up more concretely.	2005-08-21

When I first noticed that this audiobook \\"fit\\" on just 2 cassettes and the entire story was told in 3 hours, I figured that it must have been heavily abridged. I didn't mind at all b/c this wasn't a book I was likely to read in its entirety, so I was glad for the opportunity to experience a shortened version of it on audio. However, the reader speaks at a much quicker pace than any other audiobook I've ever listened to, so this might have extended onto another tape had it been read by someone else - a positive thing because although I had to be extra attentive so I wouldn't miss anything, it was nice to lightly breeze right through the story in very little time.<br /><br />It should be noted that the back cover mentions realities of China which test their love. None of these were developed in the plot on audio, in fact, Li's son was never introduced, so I suspect this abrigded version did cut a lot out and isn't as involved as the book. However, the cultural differences and family bonds that tested their love, and the inability to give up their homes and what was familiar to them to permenantly live in the other's world, was certainly satisfying enough for me. I honestly didn't miss what wasn't included.<br /><br />I found the cultural immersion to be fascinating! I admired Miranda's character immensely and I especially appreciated how her confidence in herself, and the manner in which she projected herself, blossomed under Li's influence in her life. It's amazing how being in love has a trickle down effect into other areas of daily life! Although it was a bit odd the way Li initially approached Miranda in the airport, I also found him to be very likable (I might have fallen for him myself! lol) Their love seemed so strong, like soulmates who were meant to be together, and their relationship had such potential. As a sucker for happy endings, I would have liked to see them work out a way to stay together forever, so the end was quite disappointing and sad to me even though it was presented in a tragically beautiful way.resented in a tragically beautiful way.	2005-08-15

She showed courage, independence and strength above and beyond the stereotypical prairie woman of 1888. She dealt with her \\"secrets\\" of divorce and infertility with the attitude of a modern day woman. One could help but love Amanda's equally wonderful gradmother Miss Clementine - what a hoot! The way these women opened their heart to others, the ill and suffering in their community as well as orphaned children, even when many of the same people weren't very accepting of them, was very special.  And the chemistry between Tom and Amanda sizzled off the pages - I love the scene, on the night of the ball celebrating the opening of the Banff Springs Hotel, when they first made love out in the open air - very romantic and sensual!	2005-07-23

Much more than a mere romance novel, this dramatic saga is about a long-standing feud between two families, its devastating affect on later generations by separating true lovers, and how a baby's birth and the caring work of a woman-doctor overcame the anger/hatred and brought the families to a new understanding and reconciliation.	2005-07-23

Kathleen Eagle makes history come alive in her Native American stories, and this one is no exception! I love the way the book opens, in current times, with Cecily and her mom at an auction house - the mom is only interested in the antique value of the items, but Cecily very beautifully envisions the history of each piece and the lives that touched it. She purchases an old trunk, much to her mother's dismay because it's not valuable monetarily, but Cecily felt a connection to it that made its value of the sentimental sort.<br /><br />The story then switches to a century earlier and the young woman to whom the trunk belonged. I liked and admired Priscilla immediately for her independent manner and her compassion towards Indians. Her friendship with Sarah was heartwarming, and the intense attraction that connected Priscilla with Sarah's brother Whirlwind Rider sizzled! The scene where they first met in the stable was so well-written. I absolutely loved this couple and felt the soulmate quality of their love, despite the huge cultural differences and the objections of Priscilla's dad and the white community.<br /><br />The story switches back to Cecily, who is doing volunteer work in the same region Priscilla had lived, where she falls in love with Native American Kiah Red Thunder. Although Cecily and Priscilla are similar, Kiah is definitely not as likeable as Whirlwind Rider, and I found their romance resonated much less with me. When Cecily finds Priscilla's journal in a secret compartment of the trunk, it helps her to uncover the history of the region and to come to terms with her relationship with Kiah.	2005-07-13

Now, 8 years later, after the death of her father, she decides to return home to Western Maryland to rest and recover from an ulcer and severe burn-out, and to reconcile with her mother and childhood sweetheart.  From her new adult prospective, and out from under the misguided influence of her father, she realizes that the misunderstandings that to her estrangement from both of them wasn't what she had been lead to believe.  A nicely presented story about repairing mother-daughter bonds that seemed damaged forever, and about reconnecting with one's soulmate.  This was the only story in the collection I found to be worthwhile reading.<br /><br />I could tell right away that Island of Flowers was written very early in Nora Roberts career (copyright 1982) because it is not up to the well-polished and skillfully written standards we've come to expect from her.  There are flashes of Nora Roberts brilliance in the detailed descriptions of the beautiful Hawaiian scenery, in particular when Laine and Dillon are snorkling in the reefs.  However, the story is very weak.  The dynamics of Laine's troubled relationship and subsequent reconciliation with her father is poorly developed.  Dillon is so abrasively hostile towards Laine that it is impossible to believe that she ever falls in love with him - there is nothing at all likable about him except maybe his brooding good looks.  The dialogue between them is painfully unbearable to read because it flows so unnaturally and unrealistically.  Even the housekeeper, who is supposed to be a ally, isn't presented in a favorable manner.  Thankfully this story is only 100 pages, otherwise I'd never have been able to finish it - it was that bad.<br /><br />Mind Over Matter is a pure escapist reading that cannot be taken seriously or realistically.  I found it difficult to get through, mostly because it wasn't believeable and the dialogue was so unnatural.  I had a hard time looking at it superficially.  A clairvoyant mother-daughter duo hooks up with a documentary producer who wishes to portray them in the most positive light possible.  The mother is very likable, but the daughter is so prickly and hostile that it is hard to imagine the sympathetic producer becoming interested in her.  I have to admit to skimming through the last half of the story because I couldn't bear reading it any further that I already had but I needed to satisfy my curiosity as to whether the story got any better and my need to know how it ended.  The subject matter was interesting and unique enough that the story had great potential if only it had been better developed and was well-written.lt to get through, mostly because it wasn't believeable and the dialogue was so unnatural.

I really enjoyed this story, the first book of the Americana series by Robin Lee Hatcher, set in the Idaho Territory in the 1880's, and I am looking forward to reading the subsequent books.<br /><br />Addie Sherwood is left homeless in coastal Connecticut when her father dies, and it appears her only option is enter into a marriage of convenience with his lawyer, a much older widower who needs a mother for his 6 children.  But although Addie perceives herself as plain-looking and unattractive, she would rather live independently without a man if she can't marry for love.  So, she turned down the lawyer's offer and takes a job as school-teacher in rural Idaho.<br /><br />Confirmed bachelor Will Rider recently acquired custody of his orphaned niece but has no idea how to relate to her, although he really tries.  Lark is an introspective half-Indian girl who is so afraid of being sent to the orphanage that she retreats into herself, trying to be the least amount of trouble as possible for her uncle, instead of forging a bond with him.<br /><br />When Addie appears on the scene, the townspeople are taken aback because they thought they had hired a male school-teacher, but they can't help warming up to her, as she is so likable and relates to the children so well, handling the most difficult ones with a certain finesse.  She and Lark develop a special bond, prompting Will to propose a marriage of convenience with Addie.  Although there is a strong attraction between the two, Addie is still determined to marry for love and takes the proposal as an insult.<br /><br />This story is about so much more than the blossoming romance between Will and Addie.  Addie is a wonderful and warm role-model for the children she works with.  It's also about the friendship between Lark and Rose, whose abusive father and brother object to her associating with a half-breed.  The other townspeople feature very prominently in this story too, and the reader becomes absorbed in the small-town life style and feels a aprt of the community itself.small-town life style and feels a aprt of the community itself.	2005-07-08

I read it in two sittings. At first, I was confused by how the author switched between first person perspectives and third person narratives in the middle of the scenes, but once I got used to it, it was a delightful change of pace compared to other books.<br /><br />I certainly related very well to Jemima's weight and body-image issues, and how socially uncomfortable she felt until she lost the weight. I had hoped her story might inspire me to do the same, but I am allergic to exercise and could never become that restrictive in my diet or that intense about pushing the limits with regard to working out!<br /><br />I knew something was fishy about her internet lover Brad but couldn't pinpoint what it was - I guessed incorrectly that he was hiding from her that he was gay or bisexual. Uncovering his secret was a pleasant surprise, and I appreciated the unexpected plot twist that lead to a happy ending for Jemima. The subplot of the sisterly-friendship that developed between Jemima and Geraldine, and later between Jemima and Lauren, gave additional depth and substance to the story.	2005-07-08

As an Italian-American, and one who delights in the creative outlet of cooking, as well as the comfort of delicious food, I can't resist a story set in an Italian restaurant. After experiencing heartbreak in her independent life hundreds of miles away from her hometown, Anna returns to help her aging aunts rejuvenate and revive their declining family restaurant. She was driven away years ago by a situation she interpreted as a deep betrayal in which she was unable to forgive the aunt who was responsible. Now, working together with Aunt Rose, and rediscovering the depths of family bonds, and the healing power of love, Anna arrives at a new and more enlightened view of the situation that once divided her family, and eventually learns to let go of past hurts and move forward from there.<br /><br />In addition to the wonderful setting of this story, I loved the strong hardworking supporting characters, their interactions with each other, the themes of working together towards reconciliation and strengthening family bonds, and so much more. It's a story about priorities; what's important in one's life.	2005-07-04

Yours and Mine is a heartwarming story of two single parents coming together and finding both romantic love, and family-love, through their daughters who are best friends. I loved how the friendship between the children, and the relationship between the adults and children, were as important to this story as the blossoming romance between Joanna and Tanner. What made this story standout is that conflict was realistically handled with humor, wit and good-natured teasing, rather than the unnatural and annoying hostile bickering that seems to dominate other romance novels.<br /><br />Lone Star Lovin' was also a very natural flowing and believable story, emphasizing platonic friendships and adult-child relationship as much as the romance. I did find the small-town gossiping of the supporting characters to be rather stifling, and made me feel embarrassed for Cody and Sherry who weren't given a reasonable amount space and privacy. All-in-all, a very nice sweet story.	2005-07-04

The concept of walking away from it all and simplifying daily living has such appeal, and I immediately admired Delia's courage to forge ahead and find herself. The characterization and dialogue are very well written, but unfortunately, I wasn't drawn into an emotional connection with Delia as I expected to, relating to her situation as closely as I did. I felt she moved onto a new life that wasn't much more interesting or inspiring than the one she so desperately escaped from. So what was the point? The people in her new community were a colorful group, but there were too many names to keep straight and I kept confusing them in my mind. Most disappointedly, the ending was rushed and inconclusive - I'm not sure whether or not Delia resolved or reconciled her issues. The loose ends should have been tied up more neatly.	2005-07-04

If you are looking for long involved stories with a lot of drama and action, then this isn't the book for you.  At under 100 pages each, the two wonderful stories in this collection are sweetly romantic; the type of feel-good, magical short stories similiar to those featured in the December issue of woman's magazines such as Good Housekeeping or Redbook.  The solid and likable characters are very realisically presented and the dialogue between them flows naturally.  The children have prominent roles and are charming in a precocious and mischievious sort of way.  The attention to detail, especially in describing the both the wintery New England and the autumnal rural Maryland settings, pulls the reader into these small communities.  It's amazing how Nora Roberts can make such an impact on such few pages!!	2005-07-04

Broodingly handsome, a kind-hearted, reliable, caring and generous man is hidden inside.

It had a sort-of \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" feeling, where Abram (and the Amish community) progressively relaxes its strict standards over the years without sacrificing their beliefs and traditions, beginning with the harsh shunning of Sadie and ending with the acceptance of the younger children becoming Mennonites and Abe's freer way of life.<br /><br />The Revelation doesn't stand on its own, but rather neatly ties together everything that was pending from the previous stories. Yes, new elements were introduced which could have been developed further (two examples: the revelation of, and subesquent relationship between, Leah and her natural father, and a more deeply detailed involvement into how Lyddie and Jake find happiness after it is revealed why they cannot stay together despite their strong love).  Yet, it wasn't the author's purpose to expand this series into new directions but rather to provide closure to this lovely and often troubled family. After immersing myself into the lives of this family and community over the years through the previous 4 books, this purpose was very satisfyingly achieved.<br /><br />I couldn't help my tears from flowing as soulmates Leah and Jonas resumed their romance after 20 years of being unfairly kept apart by circumstances beyond their control. Their renewed courtship was very touching! I found the way they overcame the harsh punishment inflicated on Jonas to be too convenient, and it would have been more satisfying to have the younger and more understanding/compassionate Bishops and Preachers stand up to the unreasonable elder Bishop, especially after it was revealed why he was still intentionally keeping Leah and Jonas apart, but I suppose that isn't the Amish way.<br /><br />It also touched me very deeply how Leah orchestrated a solid reconciliation between the Mast and Ebersol families.<br /><br />This is a feel-good, inspirational series that gives insight into a lifestyle and culture that is kept quite private and is often misunderstood.at gives insight into a lifestyle and culture that is kept quite private and is often misunderstood.	2005-06-25

The characters were well-developed and very likeable; my heart reached out to Peyton, and Nora was like a breath of fresh air. As I started reading it, I thought the book had a \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" feel to it, and it was interesting that later on, Nora used that book as a discussion topic in her English class.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book was that it was too long and drawn-out in parts. It could have been 75-100 pages shorter without losing any substance or depth, and that would have made it much easier to read. As well, after emotionally investing so much of myself into the story, and as a sucker for happy endings, I felt the conflict at the end of the story was unnecessary and I would have liked it better ifthe story had been tied up more 'neatly'.<br /><br />*In an unexcusable editing error on page 284, they are dining in an Italian restaurant and order scungelli, accurately described as delicate browned medallions. At the end of the meal, Peyton asks what kind of fish scungelli is, and Nora replies that it is squid or octapus. Hmmmm - Nora, squid is calamari. Scungelli is conch or snails. Further emphasizing this error, Nora then says that next time she will take Peyton to a French restaurant for escargot so she can try snails. Hmmm - Nora, she already had snails when she tried the scungelli!	2005-06-08

Although I strongly related to Abigail's desire to run away from it all and start over again, I found her to be way too selfish, standoffish and manipulative. And Kris....yuck! Way too sexually preoccupied. The only one I sort-of connected with is Maddie.<br /><br />Instead of the sisterhood bonding and nurturing of long-lasting friendships that hallmark most women's fiction, these characters were really just a trio of users who only reached out to each other for what the other could do for them. I definitely had a hard time understanding them or feeling anything for them or with them.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give the book an even lower rating is that the latter quarter or so ties up the loose ends nicely and redeemed the story somewhat, so that I didn't feel I totally wasted my time reading it.<br /><br />Still, there are MUCH better stories of sisterhood out there....	2005-06-08

This was a fun book, with \\"I Love Lucy\\" kind of slapstick humor, updated for current times with lots of sex. It read kind of slowly, with lots of crazy misunderstandings centered around the community mistaking Emma for a porn star without her realizing it, and twisting the meaning of everything she innocently said into something absurdly sexual. I think probably would have been even better (more interesting and easy to stick with) had it been a shorter book with some of this craziness editted out.<br /><br />It took a while to get to the actual substance of the story and sort out all the issues between Emma, Johnny and the misuse of her grandma's pecan orchard. Both characters were very likeable, if only they communicated better and more directly. Johnny was someone I warmed up to from the very first page.<br /><br />Around page 190-200, there was one very sensual \\"cooling-off in front of the air-conditioner\\" scene was just WOW!	2005-06-08

However, as a Nicholas Sparks book, I was holding it up to some very high expectations set by his previous masterpieces, and quite frankly, it fell very short. It simply wasn't up to the calibre of his previous books and lacked the very qualities I love most about his writings. It reminded me of a Danielle Steel novel rather than something from the deeper, more engaging, Nicholas Sparks.<br /><br />In a word, the story was superficial. The supernatural premise that drew the characters together was ridiculously hokey, and pitting New York city-life against life in sleepy small town America didn't capture my interest the way it could have had it been presented better, with more exciting characters and plot development.<br /><br />Noticeably absent: there was no deep emotional connection between the two protagonists. Even though I easily buy into the soulmates, meant-to-be concept of love-at-first-sight, I did not find the romance and coming together of these two characters to have that kind of depth or energy. I'm not convinced they truly belong with each other, or their relationship will last much beyond the end of the story.<br /><br />As well, there was no emotional connection between the characters and the reader. There wasn't a deep passion for me to feel alongside them. I didn't grow to care for them as people nor did I become as emotionally invested in their relationship, as I have with other Nicholas Sparks characters. These two will be easily forgotten, whereas Noah/Allie, Jamie/Landon, Theresa/Garrett, Paul/Adrienne, Miles/Sarah, and all the others have continued to live in my heart long after I put those books down and moved onto other reading material.<br /><br />On the positive side, there were flashes of Nicholas Sparks's brilliance scattered throughout the book. His use of vivid descriptions and attention to detail was impeccable, as always. The dialogue flowed naturally, with the right blend of wit and seriousness, and sounded realistic (very important to me in a romance novel, as most don't have this quality and instead use incessant and annoying bickering so the conflict/tension comes across as abrasively hostile instead of deep and abiding love).<br /><br />All-in-all, although I was sorely disappointed, it was still a pleasant story and worthwhile reading. I hope Nicholas Sparks goes back to novels that draw the reader into an emotional investment into the characters and their story, with their bittersweet tragic endings (or even happy endings as in The Wedding). I prefer to feel strong emotions and intense passion when I read a Nicholas Sparks.ight blend of wit and seriousness, and sounded realistic (very important to me in a romance novel, as most don't have this quality and instead use incessant and annoying bickering so the conflict/tension comes across as abrasively hostile instead of deep and abiding love).

I was prepared not to enjoy this book, which was described by some reviewers as being predictable and ho-hum. Additionally, suspenseful thrillers usually give me nightmares, so this isn't my usual genre. Well, I was in for a pleasant surprise! Besides being remarkably well-written, this book was more of a romantic spy drama than nightmarish. The two main characters were strong, likable people who I really grew to care for as though they were my own friends. I was spellbound, constantly second-guessing myself trying to decide who Steve really was, whether or not Frank was on their side or the enemy, what the nature of their secretative operation was, what was Steve's role in it, and how this would all play out in the end and resolve itself. I'm not very familiar with this author's other works, but I found her style to be realistic and captured my interest.

This story started off slowly, with a lot of annoying hostility borne out of misplaced passions and gross misundertandings. It's hard to warm up to the main characters when they start off so angry at each other for matters that could have easily been resolved by better communication instead of stubborn secrecy. However, both Michelle and John were such intrinsically good individuals that it was hard not to find them likable. The story picked up a great deal of depth when Michelle's abusive ex-husband starts harrassing her again, and John becomes as fiercely protective of her as he is tender towards her. I couldn't help cheering for them as they conquered their enemy, softened the hardened stances they had put up against each other, and created for themselves newer happier lives together.	2005-05-26

This is a wonderfully written British book, with brilliant descriptions of villiage life and deeply developed characterizations.  While I liked it very much, there were things that bothered me about it too.  First, the British style of writing greatly slowed down the reading process for me.  Secondly, there were many times when I just wanted to shake some sense into Anna.  While she was taking baby steps towards her independence, she still remained too passive to her domineering and coldly disinterested husband.  For example, allowing him to bully her into quitting the grocery job she loved.<br /><br />Anna was too concerned with appearances, and how things looked to the very uncharitable, very un-Christian-like members of her husband's congregation who didn't appreciate the assets of a passionate and giving woman like Anna.  If my neighbors volunteered to clean my house, organize my chores, and take over mundane tasks and responsibilites that I hated and resented doing, freeing up time to be more dedicated to my children (Luke in particular seemed so desperately neglected) and to things I truly enjoyed, I would be elated....I certainly wouldn't complain or feel inadequate because I couldn't please all people all the time.<br /><br />I suppose I took this novel more personally than the author intended because I related almost too closely with her feelings of extreme loneliness and not being valued as a woman by her family and peers.<br /><br />I also thought the ending could have been better. I thought the way she escaped from her marriage was too convenient, and the other men who came into her life could have been handled differently.<br /><br />(PS: If you really liked this book, try The Sunday Wife by Cassandra King)	2005-05-06

The beginning of this book was all about graphic and lusty sex, and there was no substance to the story at all.

It's not very believable that such a man who can't keep his zipper up would suddenly become a one-woman man after meeting Christina. The graphic language was a bit crude for my tastes.<br /><br />There's only so much erotica I could take before it got tedious and boring, so I nearly put the book down midstream. I'm glad I stuck with it because around page 150, the story picks up a considerable amount of depth.

I loved the well-written way the romance and attraction was presented, with very subtle erotic undertones, but without being overtly graphic at all. Set against an artistic musical background, much of this story takes place in beautifully described Cornwall England, adding a depth to the story that most romances of this type don't have. And both heroes were very likable people, whose dialogue flowed naturally and for the most part, without silly hostile bickering, another unusual feature of many of these types of romances.<br /><br />Raven and Brand were a couple five years earlier, but went their separate ways in a hurtful manner after a terrible misunderstanding, yet each had never truly gotten over loving the other. When their brilliant musical minds are thrown together to write the score to a musical, they must face the issues that had separated them in the past, and come to a new understanding, reconciling their love.<br /><br />I deducted one star because the story came to a natural ending point once the professional project had ended. However, another silly misunderstanding was unnecessarily thrown in to separate the couple once again. To me, it sort of undid all the beauty of the previous 200+ pages.together to write the score to a musical, they must face the issues that had separated them in the past, and come to a new understanding, reconciling their love. <br /> <br />I deducted one star because the story came to a natural ending point once the professional project had ended.

So many elements of this story had great potential, if only they had been developed more fully. And then the ending dragged on about 75 pages too long, with the couple pushing each other away for all kinds of unnecessarily ridiculous reasons, rather than confronting and resolving their issue. A nice story, but definitely substandard.<br /><br />Something To Hide: This story held my interest better than the first story did, and it was just the right length. It had an interesting wilderness adventure setting, and an easy-to-relate to plot about young adult children struggling for independence against controlling parents. Again, the hero was very stubborn and ran away from his issues which was very frustrating and unrealistic because they could have easily been resolved with better developed communication and dialogue.	2005-04-11

Wow- this book read like an eyewitness account of the Great Fire of Chicago in 1871 and the rebuilding that followed for months afterwards. Seeing the events through the eyes of Kathleen, Dylan, Bull and other characters in this story gave it life, and made it real and tangible to the reader! The fire blazed off the pages and I could feel its heat.<br /><br />The romance was almost secondary. I loved the character of Kathleen. Part-Cinderella and part-My Fair Lady, she was a maid who attended a society event and passed herself off as a Lady. She was feisty, brave and proud. Someone to admire for more than her outward beauty. Dylan was a bit harder to like - too rough around the edges and too set on an unscrupulous lifestyle, determined not to change. But in his heroism, he showed caring and a softer-side.  Lots of sexy scenes. Maybe too many.  Unfortunately, the story seemed to drag a bit during these scenes, and they could have been condensed to make the it flow better through the more important historical events.<br /><br />The lesson Katie taught Dylan, that the riches of love and family is worth more than money, is something those of us who are products of a material society need to reflect more upon.	2005-04-04

I thoroughly enjoyed this story of mature love and of re-inventing one's self when life's situations change around age 40.  It was well-written, with naturally flowing dialogue and delightfully colorful descriptive settings.<br /><br />Elizabeth was dealt a blow when her husband died suddenly.  As part of the grieving process, she reconsiders what appears to be a cozy, comfortable upper-class life and decides that it isn't as fulfilling and satisfying as she'd like it to be.  Digging up the  mystery novels she wrote some 20 years earlier and abandoned upon marrying and having children, she pursues her girlhood dream of becoming an author.  Her children, who are on the verge of independence, are as supportive as they can be in their own self-involved ways.  However, she encounters stern disapproval from her former mother-in-law, who is concerned that Elizabeth's new career would appear as though she wasn't left properly provided for.  I wouldn't describe Elizabeth as a woman scorned, as in the above product description.  Instead, her discovery that her husband wasn't faithful to her only strengthened her determination to forge ahead with her goals.<br /><br />Elizabeth attends a writer's workshop and meets an energetic and dynamic younger woman with whom she establishes a refreshing and rewarding friendship.  De De's uncle happens to be a famous author, and when Elizabeth meets him, the chemistry between them nearly ignites the pages!  I wouldn't describe Jake as a playboy or womanizer, but rather someone who has come to realize that he needs to move beyond shallow relationships and casual sex, and re-invent a more fulfilling life for himself.<br /><br />The secondary plots add depth to the story, particularly the sisterly friendship between Elizabeth and De De, and Elizabeth's relationship with her daughters.  De De has been in love with her Uncle Jake's personal assistant Beau since childhood, but fears that he still sees her as a little girl even though she is now in her late 20's.  He has fallen in love with her too, but fears that it would jeopardize his friendship with Jake who might not approve of him for the niece he dotes upon, especially since there is a 15 year age difference.<br /><br />The subplot about Cassie, a crazily obsessed woman who Jake decided against having a casual affair with, seeking revenge should have either been better developed to add further depth and mystery to the story, or left out entirely.  As well, it was very confusing that Elizabeth's daughters were named after their grandmothers, and at many times throughout the story, I got lost trying to follow which Sally or which Ella was involved.<br /><br />I would have like to see Elizabeth stand up to her condescending, domineering, all-around obnoxious former mother-in-law, who in my opinion needed a good telling off.  This would have strengthened and empowered Elizabeth, but I suppose it took even greater strength not to create tension between her daughters and their paternal grandmother.  However, I had trouble believing that Elizabeth would be bullied into permitting this woman to take the children skiing during the first Christmas after their father's death, leaving Elizabeth to face the milestone holiday alone.  However, that she didn't put her foot down and insist that the family stay together for Christmas paved the way for her to spend the weekend with De De's warm, loving and outgoing family in New England, to be snowbound there with Jake, and for their relationship to bloom.He has fallen in love with her too, but fears that it would jeopardize his friendship with Jake who might not approve of him for the niece he dotes upon, especially since there is a 15 year age difference.

None of the three main woman characters were very smart at all. Margo, who cannot discipline or manage her rude and disrespectful teenaged children, invites a man she barely knows to move in with them. It's not very responsible of her to put her own needs before the needs and attention of her children, especially considering their resentment and her already strained relationship with them! Additionally, the man happens to be the former husband of her friend. With friends like that, who needs enemies? This causes BB, who already has a fragile mental status, evident in the not-quite-as-bad-as \\"Mommy Dearest\\" way she treats Sara, to go off the deep end and end up institutionalized. The third friend Clare isn't much smarter - she takes her ex-husband back knowing that it's not likely to work out with him the second time around either, thus setting herself up for heartache again.<br /><br />Then there are some not-so-smart subplots - Clare's daughter Puffin and Margo's son Stuart - high school students - conceive and abort a child. Margo's daughter Michelle has her first \\"experience\\" with a man Margo once had an affair with. When BB meets a man who dotes on her, she all but neglects her daughter Sara, who ends up moving in with Margo and Andrew. There are all sorts of in-law entanglements too. I was put-off by the almost incestuous nature of the story.<br /><br />Although I find myself at a similar stage in life as these women, and related more closely than I'd like to admit to what they were feeling and experiencing, I wanted to slap some sense into them and give them a stern lecture that this isn't the way to go about resolving their loneliness and disfunctional family lives. In particular, Michelle needed a strong lesson in respecting her mother.<br /><br />I found myself confused through much of the story...too many secondary relationships and names of former lovers were unnecessarily dropped. And throughout much of the book, I thought the children were smarter, and had more of a clue, than the supposedly Smart Women did.hought the children were smarter, and had more of a clue, than the supposedly Smart Women did.	2005-03-28

Raven figured she was more than up for the job. The barefoot, black-haired beauty was a healer in sprite's clothing. Like a passionate force of nature, Raven swept into Peter's life, taking him by surprise and making the dazzled doctor long to believe in miracles again. He quickly learned that with this remarkable woman, anything was possible, including a brand-new family to call his own because of his inability to get personally involved in his cases.<br /><br />********<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this fast-reading, life-affirming story.  Peter had closed himself off from life after losing his wife and daughter in a car accident. He insulated himself from feeling emotions of any kind, especially love and joy, and muddled through his days focused on his work. He was a brilliant, highly skilled neurosurgeon, but his bedside manner was severely lacking.<br /><br />Peter's newest patient, Blue Songbird, was a sweet and mature-beyond-his-years child. Along with his bewitching sister Raven, he slowly chipped away at Peter's stoic facade, and showed him how to care about love and life again. She was a vivacious and colorful woman, with a refreshingly positive attitude, despite losing both of her parents in an accident, and having to take over guardianship of her young brother and management of their company at the tender age of 22. Although she and Peter had the shared experience of deep loss and much responsibility on their tired shoulders, they bore their burdens with different outlooks, and were able to heal each other's wounded spirits.<br /><br />Yes, the story was predictable and somewhat unrealistic (Raven's pursuit of the doctor was borderline stalking!), however it was meant to be an easy-reading, feel-good escapist story, and fulfilled that goal very well.	2005-03-26

These three mini-novels of approximately 125 pages each are very easy reads; light \\"fluff\\" to escape into and relax with after a long, tiring day.  The stories themselves aren't very deep.  Nor are they very realistic, in a \\"too-good-to-be-true\\" sort of way.  Conflicts are minor and easily overcome, and everything just flows along nicely towards happily-ever-after type endings.  Oddly enough, despite the anthology's title and the cover drawing of the Eiffel Tower, these stories have nothing at all to do with Paris, aside from the grand prize in the contest being a trip there.  This was rather misleading, as well as disappointing.<br /><br />Romancing Roxanne? by Kate Hoffman:  A cynical and confirmed bachelor is set up with a divorced mother of 4 children, by his father, who is the owner of the radio station promoting the Mother of the Year contest.  Although four children under the age of 6 are understandably a handful, they are unrealistically well-behaved and accepting of this new man in their mother's life.  He abandons his single-forever idology for this ready-made family without very much of a struggle.  The only conflict is that at first he thinks she is greedily after his father.  Once it's established that she is not interested in his father nor his money, he is concerned that his father has fallen for this woman...also unfounded and easily resolved.<br /><br />Daddy Come Lately by Jacqueline Diamond:  The owner of the magazine sponsoring the contest notices that one of the entrants is from his hometown and is someone he dated about six years ago.  She is also the single mom of 5 year old twins who look just like him.  He pays her a visit, and is unrealistically understanding about why she didn't tell him that she was pregnant with his children when he left Texas for California, and then proceeded to raise his children without him.  She quite easily lets him back into her life, and the children accept the sudden appearance of their father quite well.  The only conflict they deal with is some small-town gossip, and where to establish their home once they unite as a family.<br /><br />Love is in the Air by Jill Shalvis:  While the above stories were as much about family-love as they were about romantic love, this last novella focused more heavily on the man-woman relationship.  Kylie didn't have any children, yet she was overburdened with responsibilities - maintaining her father's private airport after his death, and taking care of her flaky mother and grandmother.  She was way too stubborn and feisty for her own good, and created unnecessary conflict in continually pushing away the man who cared about her.  It was a painful struggle for her to eventually come to the realization that she deosn't have to bear all the burdens on her own shoulders, and she needed to let people who loved her in to help her.  This was my least favorite of the three stories.he only conflict they deal with is some small-town gossip, and where to establish their home once they unite as a family. <br /> <br />Love is in the Air by Jill Shalvis:  While the above stories were as much about family-love as they were about romantic love, this last novella focused more heavily on the man-woman relationship.

I disagree with the product description above which states that Virginia and Buddy tried hard - I didn't think they tried at all, and just resigned themselves to a dismal life together. I realize this was the 1960's when marriage counseling and other current ways to cope with these situations weren't as common and available as they are now, but still, I was so frustrated that this couple didn't at least try to communicate better to make their marriage work, especially since they decided to stay together because of the baby.<br /><br />The secondary characters weren't at all supportive - Aunt Dot and Virginia's mother were tremendous enablers. Elinor, the eccentric friend, could have made a difference in Virginia and baby Maddie's lives, yet this possible storyline was not developed further.  It was odd that the one person who did befriend Virginia was Irene, the woman her husband loved.<br /><br />The only reason I stuck with the book was that it was a scant 236 pages of rather large print, so it was readable in one sitting of just a few hours. I don't understand all the positive reviews this book received. Yes, it was well-written, very human, nostaglic and even at times humorous, but I often wondered what the author's point was and where this story was going.<br /><br />I'm not even sure how it ended, how the conflicts were resolved. Did Virginia's husband Buddy get back together with his first and true love Irene? Irene was moving to California with her husband Chick, because she couldn't bear to see the man she loved making a family-life with someone else - did they decide not to go? Virginia was packed to leave, but then she said she had no place to go (I felt she did have places to go...) Irene's husband Chick appeared at the end- did she get together with him, someone she was equally mismatched with???<br /><br />Too much was implied at the end, and I felt dissatified that after muddling through this very depressing story, the least the author could have done was to tie up loose ends and give these pathetic couples some closure and hope for the further, espcially with an innocent child involved.the end, and I felt dissatified that after muddling through this very depressing story, the least the author could have done was to tie up loose ends and give these pathetic couples some closure and hope for the further, espcially with an innocent child involved.	2005-03-13

Midnight Angel by Carly Phillips:<br />I really liked this story because it was very believable. Two high school sweethearts went their separate ways after graduation because the guy wasn't ready to settle down. After they've both matured as adults and established themselves in their careers, they reunite 10 years later when he realizes that all the fame and fortune in the world isn't worth anything compared to the true love he left behind. Dylan certainly knows how to woo a woman, with lots of romance and sentimentality, which I found VERY appealing. Holly is distrusting at first, because Dylan broke her heart when he left her 10 years earlier, and she finds it hard to believe that he really means to settle down to a quiet life with her and give up his more glamourous life and women.  But she is smart enough to understand why he left then, and why he returned now. And she knows she must follow her heart and choose the man with whom she shares this deep passion and electrical connection, rather than settle for a safer relationship with someone she isn't \\"wildly in love' with. (I did find it hard to imagine that John gave up Holly so easily and stepped aside when Dylan came back into her life). The sexuality is very steamy and somewhat graphic, especially the scene involving Marshmallow Fluff. The dialogue is very realistic and compassionate, and not full of unnecessary conflict and hurtful bickering like most other romance novels.<br /><br />Meet Me At Midnight by Janelle Dennison:<br />I was very moved and deeply touched by this realistic story. Shane was the-boy-next-door and had a platonic brotherly-sisterly relationship with Alyssa since childhood. They both suppressed their attraction and romantic/sexual interest for the other because they didn't realize it was reciprocal, and therefore feared it would jeopardize their best-friendship. When committment-phobic Alyssa announces her resolution to settle down and marry because she doesn't want to end up lonely, Shane can't imagine her with any man other than himself. Out of this jealousy, he devises a brilliant and very romantic plan to quickly help Alyssa realize that he's the only one for her. The dialogue between these two flows very naturally. The feelings expressed are genuine, sweet and caring. And I found it most refreshing that although Alyssa expressed feeling self-conscious about her not-so-skinny body, Shane was greatly attracted to her womanly curves and sexy voluptuousness.<br /><br />Mine At Midnight by Jacquie D'Alessandro:<br />This was a good story, but sort of a let-down after reading the first two which centered around couples with a long history together eventually finding soul-mates in each other. The couple in this last story had a casual business relationship for two years, without ever having shared anything personal during that time. Merrie was annoyingly perky, and Tom was such a stick-in-the-mud that it was hard to imagine that these two had what it takes to form a lasting relationship. They didn't seem at all compatable, making the story less believable and realistic. The situation that threw them together seemed hokey and contrived, as did much of the dialogue. I warmed up to Tom after he became Santa because of the meaningful way he interacted with the children. As Merrie and Tom began working more closely together as elf and Santa, they revealed a common childhood experience, and although they each handled it in very different ways (which accounts for their opposite personality types), this was the common bond upon which their relationship blossomed, however it always seemed to be more about the sex than about any deep or true soul-mate kind of love.

The beginning of the story dragged on-and-on. It was at least half-way through the story, if not further, before Jane and John began confronting the problem. From that point on, I found the clues too vague and the unravelling of the situation too confusing to follow. I'm still not sure exactly how it was resolved...the detective work at the end was rushed, especially compared to the slow-moving beginning to the story. Not well-balanced at all.<br /><br />As well, Jack and Jane fell in love way too quickly, especially considering how mismatched they were.

Not that the story wasn't interesting, or that it dragged along, just that it was one of those books that needed to be read in small segments over the course of several days.<br /><br />I really like the concept that although Maddie and Dan hadn't seen each other in over 20 years, they were still as much in love as they were in their college days, if not moreso. When they finally found each other again, they were determined not to let anything, not even past misunderstandings and family issues, separate them again. This notion of soul-mates who are destined to be together is very romantic and one I subscribe to.<br /><br />The descriptions of coastal Cape Cod, and the seaside setting, restoring the lighthouse, were wonderfully vivid and made the story come alive. The conflict between Maddie and her tempermental rebellious teenaged daughter was very realistic (especially to a reader in a similar situation). The subplot of solving the murder of Maddie's father, and the mystery of what paranormal weirdness Maddie's ex-husband Michael was involved in, gave the story even further substance.

She was so unnecessarily argumentative towards him (and towards the other characters, such as Rashad). Still, she was a likable hero because she stood up for herself, and wouldn't put up with men treating her like a second-class citizen, as was the norm in this place and time. Instead, she used her adventuresome intelligence to work alongside the physically strong men in times of trouble to resolve the situations. Additionally, Charlotte was an attentive nursemaid to the wounded, ill and persecuted.<br /><br />Patrick was also a likeable hero, despite the fact that he forcefully pushed away people he loved. I disagree with the description on the back cover that he was \\"no gentleman\\". He treated the women with far more gentleness and respect than his contemporaries, and had a strong sense of responsibility and protectiveness towards them.<br /><br />This was a typical historical romance, using a lot of unnecessary conflict and bickering between the two lovers. The sensuality and sex was steamy and frequent.	2005-03-05

I'm glad I did. Even though the ending was very shocking, and gave me the feeling that it was all just a waste of time, it haunted me, keeping the story with me long after I finished reading it. I reread that last page dozens of times, and each time, the story became more and more tangible and meaningful to me. Finally I came to deeply appreciate the ending as related to the rest of the story.  (sorry about the vagueness - Trying not to give it away here!)<br /><br />I especially felt the concept of true eternal love, one that cannot be forgotten or diminished by moving ahead without the other, very close to my heart. Much of these characters and their romance reminded me of myself and my own experiences, which endeared the story to me even further.	2005-02-27

As with other Dorothy Garlock Americana romance-mysteries, I loved this book!  It had a warm and cozy \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" feeling to it, and was very realistic and believeable. I loved the countrified descriptions of Sunday afternoon baseball gatherings at the Jones' farm, the town setup, the harvest, the meal preparation, the sightseeing drives and the dances at the lake - it gave the reader a true feeling of what life was like in that time and place in the heartland of America.<br /><br />Both Julie and Evan were likeable heros, and I certainly was routing for their love to conquer all that threatened to come between them, especially Birdie. What they say about a woman scorned rang true here - when Evan saw through Birdie and rejected her advances, she moved onto Julie's father Jethro, but not without cruelly trying to discredit and slander both Evan and Julie, and to selfishly break up the Jones family so she could be the center of Jethro's attention.<br /><br />It was nice to see the good-hearted children in this poor and motherless family find happiness despite their hardluck circumstances, such as when Jack became the hero of the local baseball team. I was cheering for sassy middle-sister Jill to find love, perhaps with Corbin the police chief, although in the end there were hints that something might go on to develop between her and another nice young character. I also would have like to see the characters of Joe and Jack fleshed out more too. (Maybe a sequel is in order??? lol). The theme of not judging a man (Evan) based upon the actions of his father was refreshing too.<br /><br />I figured out Julie's secret early on, but Evan's secret came as a shocking surprise. So did Birdie's. I agree with the other reviewers that the rape-pedophilia subplot was sickening, and seemed wrong for such a wholesome story, (although it was an integrel part to the secrets).<br /><br />My only criticism of this book was that there were too many minor characters, and too many similar names to keep track of. I found myself confused at times.  Even after I finshed the book, Joe and Jack are all mixed up in my mind, and I'm not sure I know which people belong to which neighborhood family.acters, and too many similar names to keep track of.

The only redeeming and worthwhile parts were the vividly described, luscious settings.<br /><br />1. Song of the West: The description off the back cover is so inaccurate it's like they are talking about a totally different story. For example, I wonder what dream Jake was trying to seduce Samantha into giving up for him?<br /><br />Samantha came to Wyoming to look after her pregnant twin sister, who was on medically prescribed bedrest. While she was there she fell in love with the wide-open spaces, the country air, and the lifestyle on the Wyoming ranch. She wanted to remain in Wyoming permanently, but what made it impossible to stay was that she also fell in love with the rancher next-door. She thought he was committed to a more sophisticated woman, and she couldn't bear to stay while he made a homelife with someone else, so she decided to leave as soon as possible. (The opposite of what the back cover says) It's hard to imagine that someone as strong and as self-sufficient as Samantha would walk away from the challenge of another woman being interested in the man she loved.<br /><br />One thing I find very annoying in romance novels is incessant and unnecessary bickering between the characters, supposedly representing sexual tension or a conflict. Samanatha started off as a giving and unselfish woman, yet I was immediately turned off by her antagonistic and hostile reaction to Jake. Yes, he was very flirtatious, but definitely not the arrogant condescending playboy he is made out to be, and Samantha seemed to overreact in such a silly negative way to his charm. In the end, Jake became quite aggresive in his pursuit of her, but quite frankly it was a welcome break in the plot, and the only way he'd get through  her stubborness and they'd finally come together and resolve their conflict.<br /><br />2. Her Mother's Keeper: I enjoyed this story a little more than the first one, and at least the back cover described it accurately. I found the entire concept upon which the story is based, that Gwen left her job in NY and came home to New Orleans to break up an assumed affair (which turned out to be unfounded) between her 47 year old mother and a 35 year old writer, to be totally proposterous. Why should this bother her, and what business it is of hers???<br /><br />With the same annoying bickering as in the above story, Gwen immediately responded to Luke with undeserved harsh animosity, judging him without knowing anything about him, or having the facts straight. Gwen was so quick to assume the worst about him (she was also too quick to have sex with him, especially while proclaiming to dislike him so much). Luke summed it up best when he told Gwen that one day, she just might be the woman her mother is, one who looks for the good in everyone and finds it..

This is a fascinating, well-written book, but an intensely disturbing subject matter. I found it very hard to put down, the tension and suspense was rivitting.<br /><br />The reader knows that eventually Bobby will find Fran/Beth and Robert. I found myself growing impatient with all the details and pages filling up the space until he does - in that respect, I felt the book would have been better had it been faster-paced, and a bit shorter.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the ending, so all I'll say is that I found it surprising and unsatisfying - I had trouble coming to terms with it, especially since I'm a sucker for happy endings. (A sequel would be nice to tie up the lose ends.) I also had trouble understanding Fran's continued lust and attraction towards Bobby after everything he did to her - it's like she never let go of wanting him even after she tried to move on. This made me wonder about her level of committment towards her second husband.<br /><br />Still, though, it is a very good book! Very though-provoking, and one that stays with you long after you finish reading it.	2005-01-20
US	46398585	R3BU9KVT7WB2N6	155166822X	477588999	T L C	Books	4	8	9	N	N	Simply enjoyable	A well-written, realistic story illustrating the growth of a deep and abiding love between two very complex and compassionate people. The wintery upstate New York setting is described in such vivid detail. A quick, easy 'feel-good' read, which reminds us all the importance of taking good care of ourselves, especially when in the form of TLC provided by a loving partner. Very romantic, and although it did contain some very steamy sensual scenes, the focus was on the love rather than the sex.	2005-01-20
US	46398585	R1DD74VXMHLHUZ	0373835256	637973354	Family Passions	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The 2nd novel is Chances Are, not The Stud as listed above	The Family Way:<br /><br />Pru is a very courageous woman, with strong values, and a diplomatic tactful way with even the most difficult people. If there were more people like Pru in the real world, it would certainly be a better place to live! Throughout most of the story, I couldn't understand how someone like her could be in love with an arrogant, stubborn, bully of man like McCord. But once she uncovered the secrets and traumas of his past, and used her diplomacy to help him heal and move forward, it was quite obvious that McCord was worthy of being the love of Pru's life!<br /><br />Chances Are:<br /><br />I kept checking the top of the page to verify that Barbara Delinsky was indeed listed as the author, because this story doesn't come close to the quality and outstanding style she is known for and fans like me have come to expect from her. Donovan's come-ons were far from subtle and the teasing went way beyond humorous - it was pushy almost to the extent of stalking or forcing himself on Liz. And the painful secret that has Liz scared to death of any sexual intimacy is so obvious to the reader, and it should have been to Donovan too. The first 100-125 pages were a struggle to get through. However, the story did improve by leaps and bounds once Liz revealed her secret to Donovan, and he became patient, tender and understanding. He changed his approach to expressing his love for Liz and getting her to accept that she is worthy/capable of being loved, and to admit that she loves him in return. The ending was redeeming and heartwarming.<br /><br />Presumed Guilty:<br /><br />This was more of a murder mystery than a romance novel, which was pleasantly surprising! The story was very suspenseful, the search for clues riviting. My interest was held throughout - I keep changing my mind trying to decide who-did-it. The romance part was sweet and much more predictiable than solving the crime!	2005-01-20
US	46398585	R37Y9NRD10MB56	1591296455	626686646	Ruth Fever	Books	4	4	4	N	N	A feel-good novel - highly recommended.	I was attracted to this book because of its striking cover photo - a close-up of a tulip springing from the rocky ground at the foot of the magnificent and powerful Niagara Falls.<br /><br />The book was very well-written (in a style I aspire to write in), and the story moved along swiftly. I read it within in a couple of hours in one sitting.<br /><br />It was very enjoyable heartwarming story about very likable characters who help each other heal. There is a spiritual componant - Ruth is a deeply religious woman who says a personal prayer upon arising and retiring each evening. There is a theme of strong Christian values running throughout - but it is presented in a subtle, non-intrusive way.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the bit of Americana showcased in the classic car subplot!	2005-01-20
US	46398585	R2Q8QV8AWOE7SZ	1551665050	122435072	Ports Of Call	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Disappointing	The exotic setting of this book, Italy, South Florida and the cruise ship industry was fascinating! The intense rivalry was very intriguing, as was the suspenseful mystery surrounding both main characters. These are the qualities that make the book worth reading.<br /><br />However, I had trouble warming-up to either of the two main characters. They weren't likable people at all, and I wasn't drawn to care about them. A romance between these angry people wasn't really believable, and I had a problem reconciling in my mind that these two belonged together and were meant to be married in the end. This story was more about the thrill of the chase and the conquest. Although the sexual attraction was clearly powerful, lasting relationships depend upon respect, love, compatibility and caring. These characters didn't have what it takes to survive beyond the conquest stage...<br /><br />Now, the evolution of the romance between the likable secondary characters, Luke and Nevada, was much more believeable. These characters aroused my empathy and compassion.	2005-01-20
US	46398585	R1G7VVD00JQV2L	0743419154	759611923	The Fire Inside	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Disappointing	This book was way too long. The beginning and ending were action-filled and interesting, but the middle section just dragged along in a very frustrating direction.<br /><br />As a modern woman, I immediately admired Kitt for her rebellion against her society's oppression towards women - she was intelligent and lively, not to be owned or dictated to by a man. She was found a perfect mate in Clay, who encouraged her free way of thinking, and rather than hold her back, he went along with her on all her adventures. Even the bickering between them, something I usually find very annoying in a romance novel, was appropriate - probably b/c it was short-lived and basically the two did show great respect towards each other.  Having been raped as a teenager, Kitt was afraid of sex, and Clay was incredibly patient and tender towards her regarding this, slowly gaining her trust and helping her to understand her sexuality.<br /><br />It's no wonder these two fell deeply in love. So then, why did Kitt leave Clay after just a few weeks of marriage, right after discovering that physcial intimacy was a beautiful way to express their deep love? Her reasoning 1) that he didn't really love her b/c he never said it in words, despite his every action showing how desperately in love with her he was - and 2) that one woman would never be enough for him, and eventually he would stray and she couldn't bear to share him - were ridiculous. And then when she finally came to her senses, Clay had heartened his heart in bitterness towards her. This conflict was so unnecessary, and torturously dragged the story down. A little communication, which would have been expected from two such outspoken characters, could have avoided this entire mess.<br /><br />The action packed ending, when their lives were threatened by an enemy from their past, brought them to a greater understanding of their love for each other, and redeemed the story.	2005-01-20
