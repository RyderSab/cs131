Two MAJOR problems: <br /> <br />1) Too many small plots <br /> <br />It's great that the author tried to stay true to the original, but in doing so, he creates a web of new plots, new sub-plots, sub-sub-plots and sub-sub-sub-plots that never allow the overall narrative to go anywhere. <br /> <br />2) Too much insight into insignificant characters. <br /> <br />It also gets very aggravating because he has to get inside the head of every single character and describe motivations.  <br /> <br />THAT is a fatal flaw in these types of stories: they are always about what the characters DON'T say and whether they are who they say they are...or simply a foil for someone else. <br /> <br />************************************************************** <br /> <br />Maybe it would have been better if it was just a collection of short stories.  <br /> <br />There were some good ideas, but in designing a brilliant jet engine...the author forgot to include the wings.	2005-10-03

Half way through, I was expecting some kind of advance in the plot, but then he adds a whole drug sub-plot in Tijuana...I just didn't care anymore. <br /> <br />The author is no James Ellroy, where the plot becomes a web of complexity and everything is eventually related....nope, this is more a two-lane highway, that becomes, 6-lane, then 8, then 16...and after a while you just lose track. <br /> <br />On the positive side, his writing is good and the characters were interesting...I just wish he could have provided one solid plot instead of enough plots and background for 4 novels.	2005-05-30

The ending required some suspense, but instead things are just too easy for the main character. <br /> <br />2. A climax you are expecting never happens. <br /> <br />3. The chase scenes are walking chases...no running, no cars, no trains, no planes...unless he's NOT being chased. <br /> <br />4.

Buying expensive talent? What's the alternative? 2004 is the only year they've really had streak pitching. <br /> <br />However, read it in that light, definitely fast-paced and enjoyable.	2004-10-04

Usually the sign of a coward who couldn't stand up to simple questions.<br />The NRA has NEVER, EVER bent or compromised on any issue of any significance (check the record), fearing if they give an inch....and even THAT is covered in this book.<br />So, it is NOT the author who is so black and white, it's the NRA.

With &quot;Wish You Well&quot;, nice try, good intetions but ZZZZZZZ and &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; his storytelling just evaporated.<br />&quot;Split Second&quot; is a return to the style of the first four books. And it's very fast reading. But his skill has always been having all the plot threads unravel quickly as you get closer to the end. This time, those revelations aren't as exciting as the setup that proceeds them.<br />Instead of thinking &quot;Cool!&quot;, I thought &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />However, it's still above average compared to other contemporary suspense novels, just below average for Baldacci.	2003-11-08

As has been mentioned, the main thrust of this plot has been covered in &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; (which this book does credit.)<br />However, most of the book moves rather quickly, until the last hundred pages where the author gets a little carried away with the symbol deciphering and a lot of different locations.<br />I have read (and loved) all of the author's other books, but this is the only one that didn't seem to have it's plot as well-thought out as the others.<br />But I am just nit-picking: it's very refreshing to have a thriller-writer who can lift the genre into a new intellectual realm.<br />I recommend this book (as with all of Dan Brown's books) very strongly: for a quick read and something interesting to learn.	2003-05-10

Yeah, I figured out the<BR>ending a few pages before the characters (each chapter is only a page or two, sometimes less), but so what? <br />Anyway, that plot point is just one of may twists and turns. Obviously this author worked out his plot backwards and it's seamless.<br />Let's stop being so picky about an author who doesn't dumb down his plots just to appeal to mass-market morons.<br />Read it and learn something. All the \\"experts\\" below claiming he didn't do his research: I write computer software and while he took some shortcuts, he basically got it right.<br />Sheesh! Finally some fast-paced intelligence and he gets shot down by everyone!<br />For the record, I find Tom Clancey extremely boring and his books are way too long. Except for \\"Red October\\" I've never found a single book of his even remotely suspenseful. (I don't even care that I don't know how to spell his name.)	2003-04-28

For the record: I've really enjoyed every book of Mr. Grisham's except &quot;The Street Lawyer&quot; and &quot;The Brethren.&quot;<br />But &quot;A Painted House&quot; is just too slow and too simple. The author wants us to find charm, humor and basic human decency in these characters. But there's little character development or plot that rises above cliche (fear of bad crops, unwanted pregnancies, local bully, annual carnival, etc.)<br />We read about the &quot;Hill People&quot; who, with the Mexicans, are hired to pick cotton, but other than their names and salaries they remain faceless also.<br />Grisham throws in baseball (the narrator is a Cardinals fan) and a couple of fights but these plot elements do little other than to add some action. (Almost as if the author knew we were getting bored.)<br />The biggest crime is that with all these plot threads nothing converges or builds to anything. You don't even find out the final disposition of the one character you DO care about.<br />This book is Grisham...without a Grisham plot.	2001-02-24

OK, OK...some of the previous reviewers dismiss the book as poorly documented trash. That's not fair. The most interesting portions are very well documented (interference with Viet Nam piece talks, illicit campaign contributions, &quot;convenient&quot; loans, bribes etc.<br />The wife-beating and the drinking has enough documentation to make you believe some of it must be true but since the author uses the term &quot;reportedly&quot; and relies on &quot;a friend of...&quot; type sources for some of it you may not be completely convinced.<br />But that's OK, contrary to the opinions below the main themes are well-researched and the book is a fascinating read in spite of overlength and a little overkill on some of the money issues.<br />If it had been tightened up a little bit more instead of trying to cover all bases (which results in thinner evidence in places) it might have been much more effective.<br />But definitely read it, it certainly puts an end to speculation on Nixon's guilt or innocence in the areas that have been vague up to now.	2000-10-16

An  independent production company in England (Brian Lapping Associates)  wouldn't touch this story either because they just could not make the story  stick (in it's view of Watergate, other elements have some  merit.)<br />England, known for having much more of a penchant for scandal  than the US certainly wouldn't suffer for doing a new expose, but they  didn't because the facts couldn't be supported.<br />Lapping Associates ended  up filming a terrific 5-part documentary called Watergate which ran on the  Discovery Channel in 1994, watch that instead.<br />5) MIKE WALLACE WOULDN'T  DO IT?  Mike Wallace filmed an 2-hour special a few years after this  book came out on his OWN where several of his subjects claim the whole John  Dean-call girl ring was a crock.<br />Please, if you have to make up history  to sell books, get the right publisher: Marvel Comics.	2000-02-18

The book zipped a long, but I got bored with all the characters that had nothing to do with the plot.<br />Towards the beginning of the book, there is a very long section (100 pages) describing a detailed tour of a facility on  Plum Island, but it had little to do with the rest of the story and the  parts that did could have been clipped to a few pages.<br />But bring it to  the beach, you won't be bored.	2000-02-17

DeMille is a real paradox: his books are always longer than they need to be...but they move quickly.<br />They books are always longer than they need to be but the endings are always a little hasty. (e.g. Word of  Honor.)<br />This ending was completely unresolved and you'll probably guess  where (or to whom) the whole story is headed long before the FBI.<br />Good  beach read, but I'm still shaking my head over a lack of resolution.	2000-02-17

I didn't follow much of the trial, basically because I didn't care. The tragedy in my mind is that so many of us wasted so many hours following the most boring trial ever.<br />The man is guilty! PERIOD! Why?<br />Because on one  page of American Tragedy, one member of the defense team wonders how Ronald  Goldman's blood was found in OJ's bronco...yet the defense got that  suppressed.<br />There it is ladies and gentleman: guilty as sin. That is one  coincidence too many and I don't buy this conspiracy nonsense for a  second.<br />Even if you say Schiller was on OJ's side, including that little  tidbit is enough to show some balance.<br />Another tragedy is that the jury  represented 12 of the 24 stupidest Americans ever to have paid taxes. (The  other twelve being the Rodney King jurors.)<br />They confused DNA with Blood  Types? C'mon, these morons would have screwed up paint-by-numbers.	2000-01-09

After 300 pages I am putting this book down FOREVER..Extremely thin plot, routine characters (evil rich-man in wheelchair, trailer-trash single mother, etc.) <br />Critics always complain his books are too long...this  time, they're right.<br />Reminded me of FREEDOMLAND, where a 250 page story  idea (or 1 hour Law and Order episode) was blown up to over 700 pages!<br />I  want to OLD Stephen King back!

You want to learn the real NON-exploitative story of the Summer of 1977 and how David Berkowitz terrorized us here in NYC? <br />Then read this book: It's straightforward, painstakingly researched, fast-paced, and provides  extremely sympathetic portraits of the police, the politicians, the  victims, and even the killer himself. <br />As the True Crime genre goes, this  book is up there with the best of them: Helter-Skelter and Fatal  Vision.<br />My only quibble: I wanted to know more about the legal process  after Sam's arrest...Mr Klausner is there an unedited version of the  book?<br />NOTE TO CONSPIRACY THEORISTS: I tried reading the updated version  of &quot;The Ultimate Evil.&quot; After a terrific opening about the Arlis  Perry murder and summarizing the earlier events of the &quot;Sam&quot;  terror, the author goes into some far-out detail about the Stacey Moskowitz  murder...the story lost me there it was so convoluted and complicated. I  felt as if alternate events were &quot;fitted&quot; into the real  time-frame to make the event more interesting.	1999-07-29
