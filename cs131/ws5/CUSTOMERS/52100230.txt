Some parts of the book are humorous, and other parts are depressing, especially when the horse, Boxer, is taken away by the horse butcher. The characters are  delightful, and they have great human characteristics and qualities. It is  a masterpiece of writing, and I have added it to my list of favorite books.	1999-03-02

I would easily give this wonderful book 5 stars, because of all the drama, and the auther puts a picture in your mind like you're really there. She also gives all the details, like, ...&quot;an old yellow car with the paint  half off...&quot; and ...&quot;the spring stuck into my right thigh, but I  didn't move...&quot;  My favorite character was of course the main  character,Sopie.  She describes everything so vivedly, like the horrible  memories she had as a child.  I would definately recommend this touching  book to any young adult reader.  It may be a little boring in the first 2  chapters, but after that you can't put the book down.	1999-03-02

It is also very well written.  I would give it five stars for many reasons.  First, it involves your emotions.  I was actually crying at the end!  Second, it keeps you interested.  I read  this book in three nights and never lost interest.  Then, the author gives  a lot of details.  Where The Red Fern Grows is filled with exciting and sad  adventures!	1999-03-01
US	52100230	RAWCT2XLXYQPJ	0590436023	26357815	The Ghosts of Mercy Manor	Books	5	2	2	N	N	An exciting mystery beyond your imagination!	The Ghosts of Mercey Manor was a wounderful book. I love to read about ghost stories. They are so exciting I can never put them down. The story was about a girl named Gwen who just moved into a new house with her foster  parents. She kept seeing this ghost girl with long golden hair, and she was  scared to go to sleep because she thought that it would come out and haunt  her. Nobody in her family believed her and everybody thought she was  insane, except one night her foster brother Jason saw the ghost girl and  then Gwen and Jason convinced their parents that there was a ghost girl.  Gwen finally got over being scared, and  nobody thought she was insane  anymore. The only part that I didn't like about the book was that it ended  really quickly.	1999-02-26

This book is about a Japanese American child detained in an internment camp with her family in 1945 during W. W. II. The American government was at war with the Japanese government. It is a very powerful book because it  gives you a real impression of what it was like in concentration camps. It  is written in the first person style as though the child is talking. It  tells about horrible living conditions and lack of experienced caretakers.    I think this is an important historical account of the terrible things  that happened in history. It shows that internment profoundly affected the  Japanese people. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how much  governmental racism can affect a group of people.	1999-02-26

THE GIVER gives the reader an insight on lifes possibilities and questions the power of authority.  Lois Lowry uses her incredible creativity a whole new world in which her charecters live.  The society has rules and  regulations that everyone must live and abide by or they will be  &quot;released&quot; from the community.  This is a heart touching story of  a young boy and his quest for truth and freedom from the harsh judgements  of his life.  I would recommend this book to every age because it includes  creativity for the young ones and a strong and complex sense of  understanding and wit for adults.  This is one of my favorit books and I  Promise it will be one of yours too.	1999-02-24

It was about a boy named Toby and his mother who are on the run.  It was a wonderful book to me because it was very mysterious.  It was neat because it didn't tell you a lot in  one time.  It made you want to keep reading.  The book's plot was easy to  follow even though Toby and his mom moved around often and his mother had  to change her name from being found.  All together this was a good book  that you will have to read, because to tell you more, would ruin the  ending!	1999-02-24

It was kind of hard to understand.  I didn't find gnomes fighting a dragon too interesting, but it was written well.  That is why I gave it 2 stars.	1999-02-23
US	52100230	R2EDGPPIJ0EJRX	0152000097	476721115	Sweet Friday Island	Books	3	0	5	N	N	This book was okay but it could have been so much better.	I thought that this book was totally messed up with strange plot and characters, who never really made sense to me throughout the entire book.  The story skipped around a lot and I was constantly confused by the way the  author worded it and the way scenes suddenly changed.  Although it had some  bad points, I felt that the storyline was great and had some good ideas  that really held my interest up to the climax.  If I had to rate it I'd  give it threee stars because it was a good book but it could use a lot of  work to make it great.  The beginning was so boring and I almost gave up on  it and it took a long time for me to understand why I needed to know what  they were talking about.  I would recomend this book to anyone who's as  patient as I am because a lot of people would not want to read the rest of  the book and quit after the first few chapters.  I think this book deserves  the title of 'by far the strangest book I've ever read.'  I was  disappointed because I thought the ending was so stupid compared to the  good parts of the book.  The end was way too rushed and I truly thought  that it could be much better.	1999-02-23

I found this to be one of my favorite books, and I don't even particularly like horror stories. Although it seems like a sick book,(my mother thinks it is)Stephen King has taken the end of the world to another  length.Everything in the story is great.The structure, the plot, the  character development, even the ending! But as oith many other books, I'd  suggest you read this before you see the movie. It's so much better.	1999-02-23

It is a very sad story, especially the part where the sheriff took the boy's father away.  I personally really liked this book a lot, but I would not recommend it to  those who are sensitive, because it is quite disturbing.  There is a lot of  racism in the book.  For example, when the sheriff came into the boy's  house, this is what he said: &quot;There are two things I can smell a mile  away.  One's a ham cookin' and the other's a thievin' nigger.&quot;	1999-02-23

I pretty much died of laughter throughout the whole book because the main character did a lot of funny things with the help of the sixth man (his brother who is a ghost.) The reason I liked the book so much was basicaly  because the author did not use long hard words.	1999-02-23

I really enjoyed A March to Madness, because of how interesting it was to read about the coaches, players, and teams in college basketball's strongest conference, the ACC.  John Feinstein gives you a behind the  scenes look at an entire season of heart pounding ACC basketball.  From  preseason jitters to the NCAA tournament, Feinstein gives you a chronology  of Dean Smith's last games as a coach, Smith breaking the record for wins  by a college coach, superstar Tim Duncan's quest to make it to the Final  Four, and the inside scoup on all the happenings around the ACC during the  exciting 1996-97 season.  In short this book was one of the best college  basketball books you can find.  This book definately deserved a five star  rating!	1999-02-23

I would give this book 5 stars because it's got a lot of action and struggle in it.  Corran Horn is captured and put on a  backwater planet called Lusankya and his escape from the prison there is  exciting, I liked the fact that Lusankya turned out to be a Super Star  Destroyer.
