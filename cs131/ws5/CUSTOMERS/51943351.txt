As this is one of my favorite topics in astrology, I had to have this book. Even if it's rather a small book, counting some 160+ pages (incl. an asteroid ephemeris), there are some useful tips in it. The asteroids are an important factor and I'm happy to know that the author also takes into account the midpoints and the Fixed Stars. When reading the examples that should clarify the way one can delineate some charts (last seen chart, crime chart,...) I don't agree with the author about the orbs he uses. Sometimes there is a 3 degree orb between an asteroid and a planetary aspect. If you know that there are 13,000+ asteroids you can no longer use such wide orbs. This way you can prove everything. But this does not mean that the asteroids are not important. On the contrary, they are a primary factor, but only if the aspect is exact. In my forensic astrology work I also use the hypothetical planets of the Hamburg School (Uranian astrology), aside from the asteroids, and only use very exact aspects (orb max. 1 degree). It's just unbelievable how much additional information you get when combining the planets, asteroids and transeptune planets even when using a 1 degree orb. There is something I miss in the book; some more tips (and research) on how to (successfully) locate missing persons (locations and directions). The methods I know are not always reliable. Anyway I'm glad the author has written such a good introductory book.	2005-06-07

However, I was quite disappointed with the content. It's just another cookbook delineating planets in houses and aspects between planets. The delineations are well-written though. There is a short chapter on transits to the natal planets too and a (very) short chapter on New and Full Moon, retrogrades and eclipses. You will not find anything about the real standouts in the Lunar returns, nor about progressing the Lunar return chart, nor about important midpoint configurations, nor about the relationship with progressions or solar returns, nor about sensitive degree areas or exact conjunctions to prominent Fixed stars. There is nothing on the Lunar parallax. This book is a good beginning though and I'm glad somebody has written a book about Lunar returns.	2005-06-03

Interesting for sure. This book is about how to interest any zodiac sign with certain 'key tactics'. Then it goes to the next step: once your target is interested, learn how to seduce him or her. The book reveals quite some interesting tactics. Then comes the 'sex part' and how to handle your mate. If you made a mistake and chose the wrong buddy, there is a chapter on how to end the relationship too ;-) All in all this is a very appealing and interesting book.

The authors make a difference between straight and gay couplings and male and female principles (yes, the mind of a woman Taurus is different from a male Taurus). This book is full of keywords, body rulerships and discusses sex and sexuality quite in-depth. Definitely a reference in understanding each other's sexual character!	2004-09-26

Zolar describes the zodiac signs in a general way and describes how the signs compare with other Sun signs. For every sign there is a very short tip on how to seduce him or her and what is the best place to make love. This is not the best part of the book, though and you will have to read the following chapter on Venus and Mars in the signs in which Zolar discusses the 144 possibilities that exist between the positions of Venus and Mars. The descriptions are apt. The next chapter, an astro-numerological guide to sex, is a gem too. I've not seen such a topic discussed in any other book. Zolar sums up when your most satisfying sexual encounters may take place taking into account some astro-numerological principles. Though we cannot testify if the principles are right or wrong, we find the two forementioned chapters make this book worth while.	2004-09-26

The title of the book kept my interest and I thought it would provide me with the Golden Grail in analyzing love relationships. Not so... The love formula is about 15 astrological combinations, call it a pattern, describing relationships. The more combinations are present in favorable aspects, the better. The formula can be used in composites, marriage charts, solar returns etc. Christine Rakela has done a wonderful job in presenting synastry in another way, even if the 15 combinations are nothing new!	2004-09-26

However, there is nothing in this book that has not been written elsewhere. Yes, I was a little disappointed. There was really nothing new in it. However, if you are a beginner 'Mapping Your Future' gives a good overview on transits and progressions. The interpretations of the progressions and transits are kept (very) short. The enclosed CD-ROM calculates the transits and delivers a forecast report that you can print. The report was well-done but for advanced students it was way too general. Advanced students of astrology should not get this book. Stick to Bernadette Brady's Eagle and the Lark or Carol Rushman's The Art of Predictive Astrology. These two books are still the best.	2004-09-26

The Nodes are a subject in astrology that is quite difficult to understand. How to delineate these imaginary points and what do they mean ? I hoped to find an answer in this book by Kevin Burk. And partially I got an answer too. In his book, Kevin Burk analyzes the position of the nodes in the signs and houses, giving 144 placements. No other book gives these combinations, so this book is an interesting read. However the interpretations I found mediocre, there are books in other languages that give a much more insightful perspective. And if this should be the ultimate compendium or reference manual about the nodes, I would at least expect a chapter about the nodes in synastrie, a chapter about the nodes in progressions, the difference between the mean and the true node, other planetary nodes, transiting nodes to the natal chart etc... But no, these subjects are totally missing ! Only the transits to the nodes are mentioned in a very short chapter. So no, this is NOT THE guidebook about the nodes but mere a kind of a cookbook about the 144 placements of the nodes. Makes me think that the nodes are indeed quite difficult to grasp...	2003-08-05

They are simple to calculate (planetary degree in the tropical zodiac minus 23Â°), can be used by non vedic astrologers too and they give some information you cannot find somewhere else. The author explains all moon mansions in detail in separate chapters. Every chapter ends with a short overview and gives some interpretations when the ascendant, the sun or moon is found in the mentioned nakshatra. He even gives some career interests and health issues related to the nakshatras. But what I find most interesting is the chapter about relationship compatibility in which Dennis Harness explains the kuta point system and some other important factors that should be analyzed for relationship compatibility. This was new stuff to me and I'm very glad the author incorporated this in his book. Well-well-very well-done !	2003-06-13

Mann is raising some very important questions and concepts in this book. His idea of reincarnation and a potential higher function of the DNA molecule as a repository of all history within us makes sense (though I remain neutral re reincarnation). His Life Time Astrology is worth a closer look, but in (my) practise I could not always relate some specific events to his time scale. In using a computer program to print his time scale incl. the accompanying constellations and comparing them to some natal charts I'm not convinced that his time scale is correct. I'm not saying that his time scale is incorrect either, but I could not find an overwhelming evidence for a link between a certain life event and the time scale. Possibly not all birth-times I used were correct but it left me hungry. His theory - how valid it may seem - needs further practical research.	2003-06-08

In this book Richard Idemon explains some very intresting points on horoscope delineations/interpretation. Though this book is a transcript of his seminars, it's very readable and structured. You will learn how to read an astrological chart as a logical but complicated and elusive structure: the horosocpe as a magic thread. You will learn about dominant and inferior functions, the meaning of singletons, final dispositors, the ascendant as mask and incest in the family etc... Due to the untimely death of the author in 1987 we will miss quite a lot of other insights he could have given us.

A venus-jupiter conjunction in your radix will differ if your chart has a venus-mars trine as well or a venus-mars conjunction. This is just not a textbook about two planets in aspect, but about different planets in aspect. That's the way delineations should be handled: all aspects are to be seen and interpreted as a chain.

Sounds like a thriller but seems to be total reality. From my own experience I must admit that Hulda Clark seems to be on target, though I find her total cleansing 'therapy' unrealistic and hard to follow day in day out. But this has nothing to do with the reliability of her findings. Now I understand why a friend of mine, after some weeks she started to live together under one roof with her friend who is extremely allergic, started sniffing too... It's very likely that allergies are just viruses ! If you have seen someone with cancer spitting up five 2-inch big parasites from the stomach some hours after taking a natural antiparasite formula - as I have seen - one's worldview changes completely and definitively. And in favour of Hulda Clark's findings ! Though I am confident that only someone who has SEEN such (really horrible) things with his own eyes wil follow the seemingly uncommon ideas of Hulda Clark, one should remember that Hulda Clark is a scientist, and - as it seems - a very meticulous one too, who is really helping (= HEALING) chronically ill people.	2003-01-03

In another chapter he reviews all possible supermarket remedies (foods), gives some tips on storing and using the foods and explains why the food can cure certain ailments.

At least a book that tells you in a clear AND consistent way what feng shui is about, (and even how to read a compass), what the flying stars and the four pillars mean etc... The illustrations, tables and reference charts are invaluable to grasp it all. This book awoke my intrest in feng shui (and chinese astrology) again.

But when you follow the authors you can't go wrong. Step by step they guide you trough the most difficult parts. However it's not all plain sailing.

The author returns to the astrological basics: what is the psychological profile of the client ? (the elements and modalities, stelliums, configurations, etc..). Only with this information at hand you can better pinpoint when something is going to happen. The natal promise is extremely important too: if something is not promised in your natal chart, it's not going to happen. From the natal promise Carol Rushman goes to the key of all predictive astrology: the (secondary) progressions. Her rules and delineations of the progressive planets as well as the interpretations of the aspects of the progressed moon (most important in predictions !) are a must read. Next come the transits (and stations), lunations and eclipses. Throughout the book Carol Rushman speaks from her own practice. Though the book is not as revealing as Celeste Teal's books, you will find very useful information in it. Beginning and intermediate astrologers will find very much knowledge in this very readable book. Experienced astrologers will be glad to know that with the right methodology and basic principles you can better time your predictions. Recommended reading.	2002-02-23

The book comes with a CD-ROM that calculates the birth data (even without a time of birth !). Installation of the CD is very easy and using the program is really simple. After entering the birth data of you and all the people you want to do a match, the planetary positions are given on a circle (comparable with a natal chart). The names in blue (not very readable colour on the screen) and yellow tell you whose planets are on the outer or inner ring of the circle. But it's not clear to me why these names could not be in the same colour (these different colours do not seem to be functional). All planets that touch each other either side of the circle are said to be in conjunction. The meaning of these planetary pairs should be looked up in the book. You do have to look carefully at either side of the circle on the screen because the planetary glyphs are not in yellow or blue (colour of the respective person), but in the colour of their vibration. Sometimes different planetary glyphs are printed on each other. The software is not very interactive. I wonder if it's not possible to have the program show the conjunctions (e.g. by blinking dots and glyphs) rather than to search for yourself. Pointing to a planetary pair with your mouse should give the delineations instead of looking it all up in the book. But I know, this would make the book obsolete. Quantum relationships operate at 4 different levels of comparison. But the descriptions of the planetary pairs in the book are the same for all levels. There is no differentiation. The reader should keep this in mind. As far as I think the reader (the general public you know) should best keep nothing in mind, because in my opinion they will not ! Differentiatons in the descriptions would be welcomed.<br />In the book one can find some guidelines when there is no time of birth (positions of ascendant, moon and venus). And here too: I'm not sure if the general public will bear in mind that without an exact time of birth there is no ascendant etc... To me the general public won't take that into account. You can't expect that. Instead the software should discount the positions of these planets at the physical and/or the spiritual level when no time of birth is known or given.<br />All in all I should rate the CD with 3 stars (it's fun and easy to use but misses some points), while I rate the concept and the delineations of the planetary pairs with 4 stars. The interpretations of the planetary combinations are very good and that makes the book and CD a valuable tool for novices and those who want to learn something about human relations while having fun.ot sure if the general public will bear in mind that without an exact time of birth there is no ascendant etc...

With a lot of case studies he shows us convincingly the power of solar arcs in the 4th harmonic (though his examples are full of semisquares and sesquisquares - and that's the 8th harmonic - so I think you're better off with the 8th H). According to Tyl midpoint pictures that contain the same planet/point on both sides of the equation are not valid. I do not agree with that, especially not with solar arcs and directions. I refer to the fabulous book 'Midpoint keys to chiron' by Chris Brooks where such combinatiosn are called 'explosions'. In his book Tyl also mentions the rulerships (without going much deeper and that's a pitty) and the tertiaries. I'm glad that Tyl has written his experience on midpoint pictures down in the 2nd appendix. His interpretations are a very welcome addition to Ebertin's Combinations of Stellar influences. It's a treasure.	2002-02-09

Wonderful. It is remarkable how much new  information this book contains, though some of the material did remind me  of the books by Ivy Goldstein-Jacobson ('the moon last over', stacks in  declination rather than in longitude, etc...). I like the style and  approach of the author though I'm not sure if it all works the way it  should. I'll have to try calculating the sunset charts in the sidereal  zodiac and use the stacks (30 degree wheel) and other techniques for some  time. I have not found a delineation for the moon mansions (nakshatras in  vedic astrology) in the book and miss it because I'm not sure if the same  interpretations of the vedic or arabic mansions can be used. Some chapters  are rather brief but the most important information is there. This book is  recommended reading because of the fact that it opens our eyes for ancient  techniques that may possibly be worth incorporating in our astrological  work. I'm not sure if it can convince tropical astrologers to switch to the  sidereal system. I think that both systems have their validity and that we  should use them both as long as we respect the appropriate rules of the  respective systems. Again it will be welcomed if some astrological software  can incorporate these techniques so that delineating gets simpler and less  timeconsuming.	2000-08-03

I do not always agree with the  descriptions and this made me think that comparing different horoscopes to  compatibility is one of the most difficult and empirical unresearched  fields in astrology.	1999-02-06

In fact the Magi Society claims to have done their research on thousands of horoscopes (without taking into account the hour of birth !). I find this a very  positive approach since not all people know their time of birth and the  research makes it possible to come to certain very innovative conclusions.  In this book you will find a lot of forgotten techniques (the importance of  declinations and midpoints thereof - see also the books of the German  astrologer R. Ebertin). I have followed some of their rules and have found  them useful and very true too. This is a book you will often read again,  and again. There is a lot in it and this book is not for novices - though  it reads like a novel. The Magic Society's approach on astrology may change  your look on astrology in a very positive way. They may be right to have  found a method which proves that astrology really works ! I can't wait to  read all their other books too !	1999-02-05
