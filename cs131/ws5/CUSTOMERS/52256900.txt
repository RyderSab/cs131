It only has 98 pages and it's packed with illustrations and bullet items.  Word count is probably in the 15,000 to 20,000 range, so I guess we're paying for the \\"Barron's\\" name rather than content.<br /><br />Anyway, on to content:<br /><br />The first chapter was probably the best.  It had some interesting information on body language, the senses and Neurolinguistic Programming.  The authors talk about \\"visual thinkers\\" and \\"kinesthetic thinkers\\" and explain how to recognize the different types and adjust your body language accordingly.<br /><br />The rest of the book has pretty basic stuff: \\"Anger tends to be conveyed by leaning forward, sometimes with fist clenched...\\"  But there are enough insightful observations and quirky tidbits sprinkled about to make the chapters interesting.  The authors also spend time on how body language (epically hand gestures) differs in meaning from one part of the world to the next.  Neat stuff there.<br /><br />So all-in-all it was an interesting read, but based on the word count and content it should be priced in the $3.95 range rather than $8.95.	2005-07-18

In Courting Trouble, the quirks were taken to such an extreme that they eventually overpowered the characters.  I didn't see real people or events but rather exaggerated clich&eacute;s.  For example, every time the Dowager Duchess St. Fell came into the scene she stabbed someone with her lorgnette.  The first time it was funny, the second time amusing, but by the 100th time it just got annoying.<br /><br />That brings other points: the story had very little plot or conflict.  The hero/heroine essentially fall in love at first sight and there is nothing truly keeping them apart.  To fill the pages, the same information is rehashed over and over again.  St. Fell is a fortune hunter, a smirking rake.  The Swann sisters are \\"green girls\\" who eat Apricot Bonbons at every opportunity.  Bellcraven (sp?) is a bumbling idiot.  Arabelle doesn't love St. Fell, but she \\"pants\\" every time he comes near.  Read Courting Trouble was like riding a slow moving merry-go-round.  It had a beginning and an end, but during the journey you see the same things over and over again.<br /><br />I sincerely hope Ms. St. George's next novel can recapture the quirky realism that made The Ideal Bride so much fun to read.	2005-07-10

There was a lot of exposition, narration, and the character's internal.  It almost seems like a serial that was stretched and padded to produce a 100K novel.<br /><br />Originally the plot was intriguing.  The hero, Ian, accidentally shoots a teenaged bystander, Troy, during a duel.  Stricken with guilt, Ian brings the gravelly injured boy to his home and fetches the boy's sister.  Ian thinks the sister (Athena) is a child, so he does nothing to provide a chaperon.  Later he realizes that Athena is 19, and in desperation Ian orchestrates a few madcap schemes to camouflage the fact that he has had a 19 year-old-girl living unchaperoned at his house.  But all of his antics are to no available.  He realizes that he must marry Athena or she will be ruined in the eyes of society.  At this point (half-way through the book) the story starts to fizzle.  Even the knowledge that Ian was the person who shot her brother causes very little conflict or tension.  In truth, throughout the whole book, there is nothing keeping the hero and heroine apart except personal misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />I also found that the writer left several loose ends.  The fact that physical debilities run in Athena's family (club feet)  is mentioned but never expanded.  Also, what happened with the romantic subplots between Ian's friend (Caswell) and Ian's sister, what happened between Ian's mother and Athena's uncle?  What happens to Athena's brother Troy, what about Athena's older brother (does he get the heir he was hoping for)?  Lots of loose ends that a short epilogue would have answered.	2005-04-10

It was just not to my taste.  The hero was too egotistical and the heroine too wimpy (she swore that she hated him, but melted into a puddle at his feet when ever he kissed her).

The plot was good and technically it was well written, but I could not stand the characters.  The book was first published in 1989 and I guess \\"acceptable behavior\\" for a romance novel character has changed greatly over the last 15+ years.<br /><br />For example, the hero Deveryn practically rapes Maddie, the heroine, early in the book and then blames the poor girl for his loss of control.  She made him \\"angry.\\"  Ha.<br /><br />I found Deveryn's character to be cruel and gratingly chauvinistic.  He treats Maddy like a child: he ignores everything she says, repeatedly sends her to bed without any supper (even though they are staying in her house where she is supposedly in change), and he makes her eat porridge even though he has been told it makes her sick.  To me Deveryn should have been cast as the villain of the story and not the hero.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book I sympathized greatly with Maddy.  She wanted Deveryn to pay for what he had done to the father.  (Early in the book you find that Deveryn slept with Maddy's stepmother and when Maddy's father found out he got drunk, gambled away everything he owned (to Deveryn no less), and retuned home a penniless disgrace.)  I wanted Maddy to avenge her father.  I wanted her to find a big stick and take Deveryn down a peg or two or twenty.  But Maddy turned out to be a wimp.  She talked a lot about revenge but at every turn she meekly accepted Deveryn's dictates.  I wanted to slap the girl silly.  Finally I just threw the book in the garbage.	2005-01-23

This book has it all: fast-paced plot, believable characters, laugh-out-loud humor, emotional scenes, plus the added bonus of a hero that happens to be a ghost and time travel.<br /><br />I especially like how the plot is setup.  Plain as pudding Elizabeth Pudding inherits a Scottish castle which just happens to be occupied by a ghost and first lord of the castle, Duncan MacDougall.  Beth learns Duncan's sad history by reading his journals.<br /><br />Through a series of ghostly encounters, Beth makes a deep connection with the long dead Duncan and is deeply distressed by his fate.  So when she travels back in time she vows to keep him safe and thwart his devious enemy.<br /><br />Also if you buy this book you should get the second in the series: \\"A Rouge in a Kilt.\\"  Once you finish the first, you will want to jump right into the second.  Just make sure you read \\"A Man in a Kilt\\" first.  I read them out of sequence and was a little confused my some of the medieval Scottish lingo (which is all learned/deciphered/explained by the time-traveling Beth in the first book).	2005-01-23

Her characters are complex and believable and the plot has enough twist, turns and red herrings to keep even the most jaded murder-mystery reader glued to the page.<br /><br />Curious about the title though.

Fast paced, fun and hard to put down.  But if the series continues (Ian next please), consider adding a glossary for the Scottish terms.  There were too many to keep track of, and by the end of the book I was going \\"wodey\\".

The heroine, Jonni DeVries, own the house where the filming is taking place.  The story goes like this: the hero and heroine meet, they fall in love, they get married.  That is about the extent of the plot.  There is no conflict keeping the two lovers apart, no drama, no emotional zingers or villains trying to sabotage their budding romance.  I kept waiting for a crisis to loom over their sweet and steady courtship, but one never appeared.	2003-11-01

US	52256900	RWTPRP44AVTK3	0440241049	880815333	Slightly Married	Books	3	7	13	N	Y	Slightly Boring	This story is based on a \\"marriage of convenience \\" (which Ms Balogh has done with great success before in Tangled and The Temporary Wife), in which the hero, Colonel Lord Aidan, makes a promise to a dying officer to protect the man's sister.  Aidan travels to Ringwood Manor and soon realizes that the only way to protect the sister (Eve) is by marrying her.  Aidan and Eve come to an agreement.  They will marry, then go their separate ways and never see each other again.  The plan works for about a week until Aidan's brother finds out about the secrete marriage and forces the two of them back together.<br />The book has wonderful dialogue and thoroughly researched historical facts, but I found the plot of \\"Slightly Married\\" to be uninteresting and character development to be lacking.  There was no depth to the book, no emotional drama, no sizzle or spark between the hero and the heroine.  To me the story sounded flat and forced, almost like the entire book was thrown together in a day or two.<br />Another thing about the book that disappointed me was the final chapter.  Usually this section of the book is a high point.  A way to rap up loose ends and to give the reader a satisfying glimpse of the couple's happy future, but in \\"Slightly Married\\" the final chapter was used to introduce a new character.  The author takes more than a few paragraphs to describe Aidan's brother Rannulf, and give details of his life and situation.  To me this was an intrusion.  It interrupted the reunion between the hero and the heroine and sounded suspiciously like a commercial or ad for the next book in the series.	2003-04-13
US	52256900	R1D453URHW6V5Y	0821772279	638357043	Realm of Shadows	Books	2	2	3	N	N	Very choppy, No suspense, No romance	On a positive note, the plot of the novel had a lot of potential.  Two cousins (Tara and Ann) fear that their aging grandfather (Jacques DeVant) is becoming mentally unstable when he starts insisting that vampires exist and that an archeological dig at a local church must be stopped before a terrible evil is unleashed on the world.  Jacques convinces Tara to visit the site and soon after, she becomes embroiled in a nightmare she cannot accept or control.<br />The first few chapters of the book were interesting.  Lots of mystery and things popping out of nowhere, but after a while the action became repetitive and the story got stuck in a rut.  The majority of the scenes revolved around Tara denying that vampires exist even though she is stalked by shadows and fluttering bat wings.  There was no gripping suspense, no goose bumps, no nerve-racking tension.  There was also no romance between the main characters of Tara and Brent.  The author spends a lot of time expressing Tara desire for Brent, but I could not decide if the desire was real or just something that the vampires were hypnotizing her into feeling.<br />Another major problem I had with the novel was the way action hopped from scene to scene.  You would be right in the middle of the drama, a monstrous creature looming up behind you, when WHAM the focus would be altered and you would be yanked to a total different location and a different set of character.  A few pages later the focus would return to the looming monster, but by then the tension was broken and the suspense gone.<br />So in conclusion, good plot but poor execution.  Choppy writing, mediocre suspense, and a disappointing lack of romance.	2003-01-01

Richard the Duke of Cleybourne returns to his country home on the 4th anniversary of his wife and daughter's tragic death.  His deep despair and somber thoughts of suicide are interrupted by the arrival of his new ward and her feisty, sharp-tongued governess Miss Jessica Maitland.  To further frustrate the Duke's plans, his sister-in-law and his new ward's cousins arrive.  In a final blow, a vicious snowstorm strikes and the passengers of a Mail Coach must take refuge at the Castle.  Next there are a series of break-ins, a murder, and an intricate mystery unfolds.<br />For the most part, the novel was an ok read.  The romance between Richard and Jessica was sweet and their confrontations amusing.  All the characters were well defined and the writing smooth, but I found the \\"mystery\\" element of the story unsuspenseful and contrived.  In one passage the villain confronts someone who has proof that will destroy him.  The villain get angry, kills the victim, then says \\"oops\\" I guess I should have made him reveal \\"the proof\\" before I did him in.  There are lots of things like that, lots of far-fetched coincidences that are critical to the mystery and as a consequence make the whole thing less believable.	2002-12-25

It is over-flowing with one-liners, tongue-in-cheek observation, and quirky dialog like &quot;Whoa, baby&quot; and &quot;One hot tomata&quot;.

Colin was a total slob who never took baths, wore a years worth of meals on his cloths, and like to use the sleeve of his shirt to blow his nose (yuck), but he was also very kind and sweet in a bumbling, thickheaded way.  Alienore, who also had an aversion to baths, might be classified as an amusing wimp who eventually stops squeaking and sniffling and develops a little spunk.<br />On the negative side, I found the pace of the book to be very slow, compounded by the fact that it was way too long.  It probably could have been cut in half without loosing any of the important stuff.  There was also NO romance or sexual tension between Alienore and Colin.  In fact, for most of the book Colin is not even aware that his squire Henri (Alienore in disguise) is a woman.  Did I mention that Colin is not very bright?  Another pet peeve I had was the way the sentences were constructed.  I guess the author was trying to create an \\"old English\\" feel to the text, but I just found it cumbersome to follow.	2002-10-31

The plot revolves around a mystery that while a little far fetched, is still enjoyable.  The story is suspenseful (for a romance novel), and I have to admit that I was completely surprised at the end when the true villain was revealed.  The main characters in the book are well developed and surprisingly human, and like real people they possess both good traits and bad.  The dialog is snappy and flows smoothly, and there are none of those long descriptive passages that make you want to start skimming.<br /><br />Annie Lyncroft becomes the sole owner of a high-tech electronics company after her brother's plane disappears off the Alaskan coast.  It isn't long before the vultures start to circle and the company's creditors are pressuring Annie to sell.

He is released every few years to become the sexual toy of the woman who calls him into service.  Enter Grace Alexander who is tricked by her friend into calling Julian from the book.  Grace is a sex therapist, who has her own sexual hang-ups of her own so the last thing in the world she needs in a naked love slave chained to her bed.  Instead she dresses Julian up in tight blue jeans and decides to show him the town (New Orleans).  In the process she gets to know the real Julian, and begins to understand his pain and frustration.  She slowly begins to fall in love with him, and decides to help him find a way to break the curse and free himself from his prison.  So-far-so good, but at this point the book starts to get a little bit outlandish.  Gods and goddesses start popping in and out, and the story turn into a Greek slapstick comedy.  There was Aphrodite (Julian's mother), Cupid (Julian's brother who appears dressed as a biker), Priapus (Julian's other half brother), and even Athena (Julian's patron goddess).<br />I love a good time-travel book, and while this one started out great, it quickly turned into something resembling the TV series \\"BeWitched\\".	2002-09-22

It had a prominent position on the bookshelf, and the cover had a bold reference to LH's last book: Open Season (which was very good by the way).<br />The first hint of trouble came when the Dane, the hero, went looking for a pay phone (why didn't he just use his cell); the second hint was when Dane was about to board an commercial airplane and decided at the last minute to leave his gun behind and just take his knife onboard instead!  Wait a minute...  I flipped to the front and sure enough the book was originally copyrighted in 1994.  I don't mind reading older books, but I think it is just plain sneaky when a publisher tries to pass-off an older book as a new release and then has the nerve to charge the premium price of 8 bucks per copy.<br />Anyway, enough venting.  About the story...  My first observation about this book is that it was darker and much more sinister than LH's latest releases.  Parts of the book were creepy and downright gory, and it lacked the humor and hilarious situations that Ms Howard normally uses to relieve the tension in the story.  Secondly I found that this book moved at a must slower pace than her other works.  In fact it dragged quite a bit.  I found myself skipping a lot of passages, impatiently trying to find the good stuff.<br />I guess you can tell that I didn't really enjoy this book.  If you want a good LH read, try After the Night, White Lies, Midnight Rainbow, Duncan's Bride, or Mackenzie's Mission instead.	2002-09-15

There were long drawn out passages of narrative summaries that describing everything and anything in painful detail, and page after page of text without any dialogue or interaction between the characters to give it snap.  There was an over abundance of internal dialogue that had the characters talking more to themselves than to each other, and a lot of secondary characters that were hard to keep track of (probably because I was skipping so much).<br />All in all (in my opinion) not a very satisfying read.	2002-09-13

Everything is working like a charm until she starts a few barroom fights, witnesses a murder, and comes under the heavy-handed protection of the new Chief of Police.  From then on the sparks fly, bullets wiz, and the laughter is almost non-stop.	2002-07-24

A feisty heroine, a brooding emotionally scared hero, and an exotic location.<br />The story revolves around Mr. Nicholas Winston Saber Esquire (the youngest son of the Earl of Chesterfield) who was exiled to New Zealand after killing another man in a duel over a woman's honor.  He spends the next five years in an emotional prison, bitter with the world (women in particular), resentful of his father, and despising himself and everyone around him.  He is eking out an existence on an isolated sheep farm, and one night during a bout of drinking, he is tricked into marrying (by proxy) a woman he has never met.  His mail-order bride ends up being feisty Summer O'Neile who was forced to flee England to escape the consequences of an act of self-defense.<br />Summer travel to New Zealand and explodes into Nicholas' solitary world.  She shatters the walls he has built up around himself, and also battles the accepted prejudices (farmers/cattleman vs. sheep herders) of a community.  Summer falls deeply in love with her brooding, bitter husband (who she learns never really wanted a wife), and the more Nicholas tries to push her away, the more she worms her way into his heart.<br />If you can find a copy, get it.  This is truly a unique love story.	2002-07-24

The heroine turns out to be a prostitute (a very experienced and expensive one) and the hero turns out to be a wimpy 27-year-old virgin.<br />The book starts out with the hero Lord Ferdinand Dudley winning in a card game the property that Miss Viola Thornhill has been living on for the last two years.  The sparks start to fly when Ferdinand descends on the house and demands that Viola leave.  Viola insists that the property is hers and refuses to go.  Stalemate.  They end up sleeping across the hall from each other, and the battle lines are drawn.  The two are thrown together constantly over the next few days, and Ferdinand begins to have feelings for Viola.  He almost proposes a few times, but he can't decide if what he feels for her is love, lust or simply pity.<br />So far so good, a little bit of tension, a little bit of mystery, but then the bombshell hits.  It is reviled; about a third of the way through the book, that Viola was one of the most notorious prostitute in London (and very good at her job or so everyone says).  I was a little shocked and perturbed to say the least.  I kept expecting something to happen that would explain away the fact.  Well something did happen, Viola makes a bargain with Ferdinand that if she can seduce him within a week, he will sign over the property to her.  Well she does seduce him and in the process finds that 27 year-old Ferdinand (who is the son of a duke and is handsome, wealthy, and charming to boot) is still a virgin.  Yea right.  He kept himself chaste for 27 years and then decides to succumb to a woman that he \\"might\\" love...  I guess this was supposed to be a reversal of roles, but I just did not care for where the story was headed.  I put the book down at this point and never felt any inclination to pick it up again.<br />This was my first Mary Balogh book, and it will probably be my last.	2002-07-07

If you have not read any of S.E.P.'s novels before, this is not a bad one to start with, but if you are familiar with her other outstanding titles (Dream a Little Dream, It Had to Be You, Nobody's Baby But Mine), you might find this one a disappointment. I found that it lacked the witty dialog and amusing situations that characterize most of Ms. Phillips' more recent works, and in fact was somewhat depressing.	2002-07-06

I pull it out at least once a year and reread all of those hilarious &quot;good parts&quot;.<br />The book is set in England 1192 where our spunky heroine, Reina, is kidnapped one night by a gorgeous mercenary named Ranulf.  Ranulf has been hired to deliver the orphaned heiress into the grasping hands of Lord Rothwell (an elderly geezer who's four previous wives have all died mysteriously).  In desperation, Reina offers Ranulf a bargain: marry her instead of handing her over to Lord Rothwell and thereby become the new Lord Clydon.  It is a win-win solution for them both.  Ranulf will finally get the land and stability he craves, and Reina will get a strong protector to keep her people and her land safe.<br />This book is truly amazing.  Sparks fly from page one and don't end till the last sentence.  Reina and Ranulf are the perfect match and it is a joy watching them both &quot;adjust&quot; to married life and to each other.  Read this one somewhere where you can laugh out loud, and be prepared to stay up all night to finish it.	2002-07-06
US	52256900	R102U484Y9CWLQ	0843948582	339435601	The Holding	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Nice Read	Nice style of writing, good characterization and dialogue that was realistic and flowing.  The author was able to weave a tale that had me crying at one point and laughing at another.  So why three stars and not five?  Well I honestly found the plot a little bit simplistic.  The conflict between the main characters, Cathryn and William, is based entirely on William misjudging Cathryn's morals.  William felt betrayed by what he thought Cathryn had done, and Cathryn became a victim once again.  This \\"misunderstanding\\" (that is putting it mildly) kept them apart for more than half the book, when just a simple question on his part, or a brief explanation on her part would have cleared the matter up very quickly.  It was easy to guess, after only a few pages, what had happened to Cathryn, and I found it frustrating that it took William half the story to reach the same conclusion.<br />I loved Ms Dain's style of writing, and if the plot had been a more complex the book would have been a definite keeper.	2002-06-25

It was more a dissertation on how the child rearing practices of Georgian England ultimately affected the personality of the future Queen Victoria.<br />You can tell after skimming just a few pages of this book that a huge amount of research went into it (there are more that 40 pages of footnotes and references), but I found it very difficult to read and even harder to follow. It concentrated almost exclusively  on the mundane facts of how she lived, rather than on who she was.  There are hundreds of detailed descriptions of the clothes she wore, the books she read, the food she ate, and the toys she played with.  There were even more descriptions on how the people around her influenced the food she ate, the books she read, the toys she played etc, etc.<br />So don't get this book if you are looking for a biography about Victoria's early life, but check it out from the library if you want to see some truly beautiful illustrations (some by Victoria's own hand) and some outstanding photographs.	2002-06-25

US	52256900	R3P6Y0JEUUDWM1	0553107836	810981621	The Daddy Clock	Books	2	1	2	N	N	No Romance	I can't say that I enjoyed this book very much.  It started out with promise, but it lost all appeal for me about halfway though.  For one thing, there was very little romance, or mutual attraction between the characters.  They were kind-of attracted to each other, but nothing solid.  Even at the end, I was not quite sure if the two of them were going to get together.<br />The story revolves around a 44-year-old bachelor (Charlie Feldman) who has an overwhelming urge to find a wife and start a family.  Lacy Gazzar, who is a co-worker, befriends Charlie and coaches him on the dos and don'ts of parenting (she has a 17-year old daughter), relationships, writing personal ads, etc., etc.  Well one thing leads to another and Lacy ends up pregnant.  The big problem is that Lacy is not sure if Charlie is the father of the baby (it could be the child of a guy she goes line-dancing with).  Lacy agrees to have the baby as long as Charlie takes full responsibility for it, and she does not have to acknowledge or in any way associated with it.  She even tries to illegally remove her name from the baby's birth certificate.  Lacy definitely had some issues.<br />I also found the First Person style of writing very confusing.  Normally I enjoy first person, but in this book both Lacy and Charlie were narrating.  When I would start a new chapter or section, it would always take me a few sentences to figure out if it was Charlie or Lacy speaking.  They both refer to themselves as &quot;I&quot;, so I would have to figure out from the content who was speaking.  Granted, each chapter was labeled with a date and a name (Lacy or Charlie), but I still found the style confusing and annoying.	2001-12-14

She hops a bus (dragging no less than five suitcases) and ends up in her chauffeur's hometown of East Wapaneken.  Quinn Delaney (ex-cop turned bodygurad) is sent to watch over and protect Shelby, but not interfere with her great adventure.  What ensues is a laugh-a-minute good time.  Lots of hilarious situations and quirky characters, but also tender moments and in the end a deep sense of accomplishment.<br />All in all this was a thoroughly enjoyable read, and well worth the price of admission.	2001-12-10
US	52256900	R2FP9C6P84DHEN	082177008X	100629802	Devil May Care	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Average Read	The story is about the convent educated Lady Eden Spencer who decides to experience &quot;life&quot; before taking her vows.  With the help of her cousin Reggie, she enlists the aid of London's most disreputable rake, Damien Sinclair, to introduce her to the wicked side of life...<br />As a whole, I would rate this book as average.  I liked the dialog and character development, but I found the plot to be painfully predictable.  I also never understood what motivated some of the characters.  Why did Damien's mother dislike her children so much, and why did Lord Myddleton have a grudge against Damien?  How come Damien's brothers seemed to have lots of money, but Damien was broke and about to lose his home?  Why did Lady Eden have a title, but not her Uncle (her father's brother) or Reggie?  Maybe I skipped a few pages, but there seamed to be a lot of inconsistencies.<br />On a more positive note, there was one truly expecional facet of this book, namely the character of Reggie.  He was totally unique, wickedly irreverent, and downright hilarious.  He and his dog Miss. Phipps were the best part of the story.  I had visions of an entire book about Reggie and his search for the perfect mate, but all possibilities for a &quot;Reggie book&quot; were dashed with a single sentence at the end of the book.  To bad.	2001-12-10

It had an unusual plot and well developed principal characters, but I found it concentrated too much on the political problems of the era and not enough on the romance between the two principal characters.  The story is set in the Middle Ages during the reign of King John of England.  A lot of time and effort is spent describing the social unrest in Wales, the political battles between the King and his Barons, the struggles between England and France, and the cruel and vicious actions of King John.  In contrast, very little time is spent on the interactions between the main characters (they spend most of the novel apart doing their own things), and there is a very obvious lack of humor in the book (I think I cracked a smile once).<br />As a history refresher the book has some merit, but if you want to read a good romance novel, I would suggest skipping this one and picking up Ms Carroll's other novel &quot;The Bride Finder&quot;.  That one is a real gem.	2001-11-21

It had lots of useful information, complete lists of supplies, and detailed firing schedules (for both Bullseye 90 and Spectrum 96 ).  It tells you everything you need to know (and what to buy) to start you on the road to fusing bliss.<br />The Table of Contents lists chapters on:  *Glass Types and Forms (goes into COE and glass compatibility); *Supplies and Equipment; *Preparing the Kiln for Firing; *Keeping a Firing Log; *The Basis Fusing and Slumping Process;  *Molds for Slumping;  *Troubleshooting;  *Fusing and Slumping Techniques; *Glass Polishing; *Finishing for Display; *Compatibility Testing;  *More about Annealing; *Kiln Casting; *Glass Painting; *Making Your Own (devit spray, kiln wash, iridescent glass, frit, stringers);  and *Master Firing Schedules<br />My only complaint about this book is its poor editing.  The proofreader must have been asleep at the computer when he/she reviewed the content and page layout of this book.  There are lots of typos, misused words, forgotten punctuation (missing periods at the end of sentences), and most disturbing of all UNFINISHED sentences.  On several pages the last sentence on one page is not completed on the next page.  For example, page 57 ends with the partial sentence &quot;If you plan to use&quot;, and page 58 begins with the sentence  &quot;Some people use the spray for every slump firing.&quot;  I never could figure out what the author &quot;Planed for me to use&quot; on page 57.<br />The typos were annoying, but not enough to distract for the content.  So 5 stars for the writer, -5 stars for the editor.	2001-10-27

It was snappy, witty, and flowed along as smooth as warm honey.<br />In a nutshell the story is about a young school teacher who leaves her home and sisters in Philadelphia and heads off to Haven Kansas for her first teaching position.  There she meets the town's resident &quot;Bad Man&quot;, and sparks immediately start to fly.  The story has excellent character development, and a slew of entertaining secondary characters including the town gossips, the school bully, and strangely enough a pet snake.  This book will put a smile on you face and give you a deep respect for Ms Law's writing ability.  So why 4 stars and not 5 you may ask?  Well my only complaint was that I found the plot a little thin.  There could easily have been a lot more conflict and hanky grabbing emotion added to the story line; instead, it held strictly to a light-hearted humorous tone.  There is nothing wrong with light-hearted and humorous, but for me it is always that strong emotion that turns a good book into a keeper.<br />All in all it was an enjoyable read.	2001-07-13

It started out great with the vampire kidnapping Alexandria, and keeping her prisoner in a cold and sea sweep cave.  The scenes were vivid and detailed, and you could almost feel her pain and confusion.  Alex's rescue by Aidan was dramatic and riveting and probably the best part of the book (chapter 3).  The disappointing thing is that the story was sort-of ho-hum after that.<br />If I had read this book first, I might not be as critical.  But knowing how good Ms Feehan books can be, this one was a little disappointing.	2001-07-09

The topics covered are quite interesting and somewhat unusual, and the author uses a lot of actual newspaper articles, statistics, and personal accounts from the period.  This book does a good job of capturing the everyday workings of the city, and covers a lot of information that I have never encountered before.

Since childhood I have always had an unreasonable fear of vampires, but I can honestly say that his book cured me of my phobia.

The tone and style of the writing holds your interests and makes you want to read more.  It is fast paced with lots of action, drama and romance.  The main characters are well developed and likable.  Jacques is a perfect mix of tormented soul and dangerous predator, and Shea is a realistic blend of independence and submissiveness.  The only problem I had with the book, was that I thought the villain was very under developed.  The reasons for his actions were never fully explained or explored.

US	52256900	R2GBMVJ53O99TK	0821766406	691787020	My Own	Books	3	3	4	N	N	OK, but I kept waiting for certain &quot;events&quot; to take place	An ok read, but I found it very frustrating because the book was nothing like what was written on the back cover synopsis.<br />According to the first paragraph on back cover the story is about Kate Quinn, an orphaned girl, who is raised by her wealthy stepfather.  The young Kate feels lonely and out of place until she meets the boy next door (Ethan Winston), who becomes her best friend and soul mate.  The second paragraph of the synopsis states that Kate, as the legal guardian of her half-sisters, must raise them alone just as Ethan is raising his young DAUGHTER alone (actually he has a son and not a daughter).  Kate, who has always loved Ethan, suggests that they join forces and raise their dependents together.<br />Well needless to say I expected the book to be about Kate and Ethan's marriage and life together... but it was not.  I found the book frustrating because I kept waiting for things to happen that would allow the two to get married.  It sounds kind of morbid, but I kept waiting for Kate's stepfather to die so Kate would become her half-sisters guardian.  I also kept waiting for something to happen to Ethan's wife (how could he marry Kate if he was already married to someone else).  Well neither of those things happened until late in the book, and Kate and Ethan don't end up married until almost the very end.<br />I found myself on edge the entire time I was reading the book.  When was this going to happen, when was that going to take place.  I think if the synopsis had been worded differently, my impression of the book might have been totally different (but then again maybe not).	2001-02-24

The novel had all the right elements, but the writing itself never captured my interest.  I found the book slow and plodding with very little energy, emotion or excitement.  It worth a read if you want to learn some interesting Scottish legends, history and folklore, but pass if you want a lively romance novel.	2001-02-20

The story revolves around FBI Agent Kate Ellison who is assigned the task of keeping millionaire businessman Alex Romero out of the sites of a cold-blooded hit man.  The FBI decides that the easiest way for Kate to keep watch over Alex is for them to pretend to be married.  Now this scenario is a great setup for romance, but it has a few &quot;real-life&quot; flaws.  For one, I think it is very unlikely that the FBI would assign only one agent to a case of this magnitude.  There should have been some other FBI agents in the picture.  Even a surveillance van parked out of sight, or some agents posing as nosy neighbors would have added a touch of realism.  A second problem was when Alex return home.  The FBI and local police abandoned their watch of Alex and the surveillance of his property after a simple request.  Very unlikely I thought.<br />I also found some of the conversations between Kate and Alex to be very immature.  At a few points they sounded more like giggly pre-teens rather than highly successful adults.<br />On the whole it was a pleasant read, but a bit more research into the workings of the FBI and a few adult conversations would have been nice.	2001-02-18

This was the first book I read by Cherry Adair, but it won't be my last.  Her writing style and character development reminds me a lot of Linda Howard (need I say more).  In a nutshell the book is about a super-spy guy (with a bruised and battered heart), meeting his soul mate in the form of a feisty petite blond.  Add an affectionate Grate Dane and some extremely nasty &quot;baddies&quot;, and you get one memorable book.	2001-02-18

I also found the heroine Cathleen to be silly and very immature.  Cathleen is forced into a marriage with Adrian the Earl of Greystone by Cathleen's sinister uncle Lord Charlwood.  Soon after the wedding, Adrian is called to Paris to help the Duke of Wellington, and Harry (the Earl's younger brother) appears on the scene.  Kate and Harry hit it off right away and soon they become bosom buddies.  They have a grand time searching for a missing groom, gathering clues, and hunting down and confronting a murder.  Adrian appears sporadically through the story, but he is never included in the action.  I think the story would have been more &quot;romantic&quot; if Adrian had been the one to solve the mystery rather than his brother Harry.	2001-02-15

It is heart wrenching and very emotional.  Make sure you have a box of tissues handy and maybe even a finger of whiskey (so you can toast Rosie's accomplishments).<br />The novel is actually two stories in one.  It is about two vastly different women who must each overcome hardships and trauma on the road to self-awareness and self-respect.  One of the heroines is Rosie Mulvehey, who saves Bowie Stone from the hangman's noose by selecting him to be her husband.  In exchange for his life, Bowie agrees to help Rosie plant and harvest her crop on a dusty Kansas farm.  With Bowie's help, Rosie is able to face the demons of her past and overcome the hardships of the present.  The second heroine is Susan Stone who, along with her young son, is abruptly evicted from her opulent Washington D.C. home.  Without friends, family or money, Susan is forced to answer a want ad for a mail-order bride.  She travels cross-country to Wyoming, only to be rejected by her waiting husband-to-be.  She quickly learns that she must face the world head-on if she and her son are to survive.<br />I really enjoyed this novel it was well written, face paced and a real tearjerker.  The only reason that I did not give it a &quot;Five&quot; is that I found the finale with Rosie and Bowie a little short.	2000-11-13

The book begins on a high note with Meg being kidnapped by her childhood sweetheart Alec.  Both the kidnapping and their flight to Scotland was fast paced and highly entertaining.  I loved Alec's boyishness and Meg's inability to resist his charm.  The writing in the first 100 pages showed a lot of promise, but for me the story began to lose its punch when the pair reached Meg's childhood home in Scotland.  The meeting between Meg and her father was flat and once Sir Robert tells his version of the supposed &quot;dalliance&quot; the weakness of the plot becomes apparent.  I also thought that Meg gave in to the forced marriage a little too easily.  All her father had to do was threaten a scandal and Meg meekly walked down the aisle and said, &quot;I do&quot;.  After the wedding, I found that the story lost a lot of its energy.  There were no villains, no intrigue, and no true conflict between the characters.<br />All in all I would classify the book as average.  It is worth reading, but don't put it on the top of your list.	2000-10-21

The characters in Ms Howard's novels always seam so real and alive, and  the principals in White Lies (Jay and Super Spy Steve) are no exception.  The book starts out with Jay caring for a critically injured man she  believes to be her ex-husband.  The man is covered from head to toe in  bandages so a positive id is impossible (or so the oh-so-nice FBI agent  says).  Jay cares for the man day and night, and finds her self becoming  more and more attached to him. (I found this section of the book a little  slow, but hey what can you expect when the hero is in a coma and unable to  communicate.)  Sometime during chapter three Steve starts to regain  consciousness, and the pace of the book becomes noticeable faster.  By the  time Steve is released from the hospital, I was on the edge of my seat and  biting my fingernails.  I became so involved in the story that I could not  put the book down.<br />This is another great read from Ms Howard.  Just  keep in mind that it starts a little flat, but it ends with a sizzle.	2000-08-19

I'm not quite  sure what the problem was, but something was definitely off.  The novel is  set in London 1811 with the heroine, Emmaline, trying to support herself  and an aging aunt by means of a marriage broker service.  Unfourtenely her  first paying customer dies near her doorstep under suspicious  circumstances.  Enter Adrian, the duke of Trent who has been reluctantly  recruited to determine if the lovely Emmy had something to do with the  death.  A love-hate relationship quickly develops between Emmaline and  Adrian, and the supporting characters (Emmaline's ex-actress aunt and  Adrian's man-of-affairs) do everything they can to throw the couple  together.<br />Individually I found all the characters likable (especially the  canary) and the plot interesting, but as a whole the book was uninspiring.  There was no nail-biting tension, no steamy passion, and no real reason to  turn the pages.  I sorry to say this was a yawner.	2000-08-14

There are also a few pattern with women's profiles, two  peacocks, a fish, and a very impressive butterfly pattern (I have seen this  one for sale at the auction sites several times).

Ms  Osborne writes in a style that is both witty and emotional.  Her characters  are living breathing personalities that seam to jump off the page, and pull  you into their world. Their frustrations become your frustrations, their  pain your pain.  I cried when fate bombarded Max with tragedy after  tragedy, and smiled at Low Down's joy with life's simple pleasures.  I felt  like strangling that pampered stuck-up princess, and hugging the charming  Sunshine.<br />The plot of the story was well thought out and nicely  executed.

Ms Claiborne's writing style was witty, and the  interactions between Melisande and the goalkeeper Mr. Bell was delightful.  The part about the &quot;She-Devil of Mooresby Hall&quot; was a hoot, and  Mr. Bell's reaction to the She-Devil's offer of marriage was one terrific  piece of writing.  After reading only a few pages of the book I was well  and truly &quot;hooked&quot;, so I settled in for a long night of reading.<br />Unfortunately, my enthusiasm for the book began to fade as the  character of William Tiger Taggart took shape.  After a few chapters I  started getting irritated with this Will person, and after a few more I  really started to dislike him.  I found him conniving and underhanded, and  mercenary to an extreme.  About halfway through the book William's  financial predicament is explained and Ms Claybourne starts to accentuate  Will's more redeeming qualities, but unfortunately I never got over my  initial dislike of Will.<br />I also found that there were a lot of loose ends  in the book and a lot of actions that were not completely explained.  I  can't go into too much detail without giving away the story, but I never  really understood why Will left Scotland or why he came back.  Another  compliant I have about the book was the abrupt ending.  It took 295 pages  of text to develop the problems, conflicts and misunderstandings between  the characters, and FOUR pages to resolve everything.  Frankly I felt a  little cheated.  The Epilogue was also painfully brief (a little over a  page) and uninformative.  I would have like to know if the distillery  succeeded, did Wildcat go back to America, did the prison reform experiment  work, was Melisande brother able to manage the estate on his own, did  Sister Maggie ever visit again, did the people of Devonshire miss the  She-Devil?e-Devil?	2000-08-11

There are also quite a few nouveau nature screens (dolphins, parrots, seascapes, tropical fish, etc), which is not surprising  considering that this is the &quot;Fort Lauderdale&quot; edition.  I was  really impressed with the &quot;Grand Entryways&quot; and  &quot;Abstractions&quot; sections; some of the designs are truly  amazing.<br />The book has 78 pages, and every other page is jammed packed  with photographs of actual stained glass windows, doorways, and transoms.  The photos are all extremely well done and inspiring.  The other pages are  filled with scaled patterns.  I especially liked the fact that all of the  patterns are shaded to indicate colors and textures.  Two negatives about  the book are: 1) not all of the scaled patterns have a corresponding photo  of the completed panel, and not all of the photos have corresponding scaled  patterns (this gets very confusing a times) and 2) the binding is of a poor  quality (the pages started to fall out almost immediately).	2000-07-31

You could probably chop off a hundred pages and not lose much of the story.<br />On the positive side: The plot has some interesting twists and turns (and  several dead bodies), and the descriptions of the environment and castle  workings are very believable.  The principals (Luc, Brianna, Gavin &amp;  Connor) are all well developed, and I especially liked the attention given  to the secondary characters.  All in all it is a good read and well worth  a Sunday afternoon.<br />In response to some previous reviews about winter  gardening practices:  I prune my rose bushes and hedges during the fall  (late September) and again in the winter (early January).

US	52256900	R2EOJB3NIL2AB7	1551661535	834980944	Midnight Rainbow	Books	5	5	6	N	Y	Excellent	Linda Howard is a great story teller.  The imagery and descriptions in this book are outstanding, and the character development is excellent.  I was hooked after the first three pages, and I could not put the book down  until I finished.  Sorry this is so short, but I must go buy more LH books.	2000-07-24
US	52256900	R2VZNE39QZ5M3L	0843946946	780167679	Potent Charms (Leisure historical romance)	Books	3	5	6	N	Y	Average	This was an ok book, but not a real page-turner.  Phoebe was a lovable character, but after the first few chapters I came to heartily dislike Stephen.  His only goal was to convince Phoebe to become his mistress  without regard to how the label would affect her life, her position in  society, or the life of their children (which Phoebe longed for).  Granted  his main reason for not wanting to marry Phoebe was a fear that an old  family curse might cause her death, but I still found his solution (making  her his mistress) a tad selfish.  Overall the book was ok, just not one I  plan on keeping.	2000-07-23
US	52256900	R27P4QA92VTANL	0821759590	856178672	Timeless Passion	Books	5	12	14	N	N	A Keeper	Now this is a good book! It is one of my all time favorites, and has a place of honor on my &quot;Keeper&quot; shelf.  Everything in this book works to perfection.  The characters are well crafted and the situations  are believable (even though Brianne goes back in time).  The dialog is  flowing, and the emotions are strong.  It reminds me a lot of &quot;The  Flame and the Flower&quot;, but with a spunkier modern heroine.  I  especially like the Epilogue when the author explains what happens to  Brianne's present day body.  PS: be careful whom you lend this book to, you  may have trouble getting it back.	2000-07-23
US	52256900	RI59XGUAFHVF4	0553575015	683613604	Nobody's Darling	Books	4	0	0	N	N	A real good time	I really enjoyed this book.  It has a lot of humor and very enjoyable situations.  The characters worked well together, and there was a nice mix of good, bad, silly and proud personalities.  Just one warning, don't read  this book in the company of others.  Your constant giggling may cause them  to question your sanity.	2000-07-23
US	52256900	R38XUBCY9S3X5Z	1556236832	635384044	Stan Weinstein's Secrets For Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets	Books	5	13	15	N	Y	Very Educational	This is a great primer for the use of Technical Analysis in stock trading.  It gives detailed information on when to buy and better yet, when to sell stocks.  The writing style was entertaining, so my interest was maintained  even through the most complex explanations.  The book does not go into the  more advanced analysis tools but for anyone new to Technical Analysis this  is a great book.	2000-07-23
US	52256900	RSEYUR9Q9WRZR	0471059706	730525244	Reminiscences of a Stock Operator	Books	5	2	2	N	Y	Pearls of Wisdom	This book is a great study of human nature.  It follows the life of a stock trader from rags to riches, back to rags again then riches, next to a nasty &quot;incident&quot; then to more riches, finally rags for the last  time and then on to millions!  The book is not a &quot;how-to&quot; on  investing, but rather a collection of stories each of which offer a lesson  in investing and human nature.  It shows how easily the price of a stock  can be manipulated (for a short period of time), how unreliable  &quot;tips&quot; are, and the advantages of pyramiding your stock  purchases.  I found the first half of the book (the younger years) to be  much more entertaining than the latter half (the big money deals), but  overall the book is excellent.  I was disappointed in the fact that the  book did not include the crash of 29 and the depression.  I would like to  know how Larry handled that situation.	2000-07-20
US	52256900	R3AVT01VF1BFEJ	0553295810	361021097	Princess of the Veil	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Very Good	This is one of my favorite books.  It has strong characters, strong emotion, and realistic conflicts.  It is set in Scotland during the 11th century, and vividly portrays the life of that era.  I understand it is out  of print, but if you can find one for auction snap it up.	2000-07-14
US	52256900	R1FYAFE2PK86XY	0380796368	595305092	The Maiden Bride	Books	3	4	7	N	Y	So So	I just could not get into this book.  Technically the writing was good, but the story just did not grab me.  I found the plot a little contrived and the actions of the characters unrealistic.  For example, if Eleanor  (the heroine) needed a baker, all that she needed to do was wish really  hard and one would show up at her gate.  A lot of robbers, pickpockets and  criminals also showed up at her gate, but in the end they were all reformed  by her loving nature.  I find it hard to believe that there was not one  ax-murder, rapist, or even a bad tempered person in the entire bunch.  I  guess in the end I found the book just a little bit too &quot;cute&quot;.	2000-07-14
