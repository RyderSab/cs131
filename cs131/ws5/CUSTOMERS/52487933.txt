I read this book in less than 2 days because I couldn't wait to find out how it all ended.   <br /> <br />15 years ago Angie, Rosemary & Kirby wished on \\"Bob, the comet\\".  Angie wished for something exciting to happen next time \\"Bob\\" came around & granted their wishes, and did she get her wish come true with Ethan.  Rosemary wished for Willis, to get what was coming to him, which also came true.  Now its Kirby's turn for hers.  James is an internationally known playboy peeping tom who tells everyone in Endicott that he has seen Kirby naked.  Kirby wished for a true love that would last for ever.  What she gets is James who shows her where she is going wrong with the local eligible bachelors.  She is also the towns nice girl who is also a virgin at the age of 30.  Some of the things she has tried in the past to attract the men are hillarious.  Kirby's problem is that the men of Endicott either think of her as a sister or daughter & can't see any man doing that to her.  Until James comes to town & things change for Kirby with his help. <br /> <br />I just loved this whole series, its brill.  I just wish that there could be more, when \\"Bob\\" makes his next appearence, or the one after, say with the children of Angie, Rosemary & Kirby being born in the year of the comet getting their stories & their wishes come true.  It would be fantastic to see the locals of Endicott again.  With \\"Bob\\" appearing every 15 years this series could run & run.	2005-03-13

Duncan Tallchief is the eldest of 5 siblings.  He has raised them since their parents were murdered when he was 18.  Duncan, Calum, Birk, Elspeth & Fiona all vowed to stay together.  Officials wanted the 4 younger children to go into homes, but Duncan took responsibility for them all.  When their parents were murdered, the boys tracked the killer in their mountain & bought him to justice.   <br /> <br />The Tallchief's made a vow.  There is a legends attached to the dowry their great, great, grandmother Una bought to her husband, a sioux chieftain.  The dowry had to be sold to save their home.  Each of them had to find a piece each.  This gave them hope, something to focus on during the tough times of the childhood.  Duncan's was the cradle that his ancestors had slept in. <br /> <br />Along came Sybil.  Her teenage daughter had been kidnapped.  She wants Duncan to find her.  After hearing about the legend attached to the cradle from Duncan's sister Elspeth, Sybil traces it & gives it to Duncan as payment for finding her daughter Emily, as he will not accept any payment from her. <br /> <br />This story really griped me from the 1st. page.  I love the legend behind the missing dowry.  Each one has its own legend, which i'm sure we will find out about in the rest of the series. <br /> <br />The next one (Bk.2) is \\"Tallchief's bride\\", which is Calum & Talia Petrovna's story.	2005-01-19

Lazaro's revenge (bk.2-The Galvan brides mini-series) is set a couple of years after \\"In Dante's debt.  Lazaro is the illegitimate son of Tino & brother of Dante.  Lazaro has been secretly working to destroy Dante because of the way his mother & himself was treated by the aristocratic Galvan's.  He succeds but at a cost. <br /> <br />Zoe, Daisy's sister who is Dante's wife is kidnapped by Lazaro at Dante's request because of her relationship with an older man.  While she is with him Lazaro is about to take over Dante's company.  Lazaro has worked for Dante for years, plotting his revenge.  Daisy is near the end of her 3rdp pregnancy, the previous 2 babies died when the take-over begins.  Daisy is rushed to hospital & delivers the baby.  The situation is very frought with tension as Dante & Lazaro come face to face.  Daisy nearly died.  Daisy & Zoe's mother died in childbirth when Zoe was born. <br /> <br />Zoe finds herself in an imposible situation, loving the man who is out to destroy her family.  Zoe marries Lazaro to save Dante & Daisy.  The take-over is turned into a merger.  But even that doesn't put things right.  Daisy disowns Zoe when she marries Lazaro.  To her family is everything. <br /> <br />How can things ever be right between the 2 brother s & sisters again.  It will need a miracle... <br /> <br />I have never read a book where the hero is so evil, where his actions hearly cause the death of 2 people very close to him.  You wonder to yourself as you read this story how it can ever be resolved to everyone's satisfaction.  But Jane has done it brilliantly. <br /> <br />I'm of to read bk.3 \\"Mistaken for a mistress\\" which is an online read from Mills & Boon.  Estrella Galvan is the heroine & is sister to Dante & Lazaro.  It is set 5 years after this one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-10-28

The women have no rights, even the right to wear clothes.   On The planet Joo, women there have to walk around naked & with a dog collar on.  Rem joked that Giselle might enjoy it & should take the collar & lead home with them so others can try it .  This is one thing that I don't like about this series.

I started this book a couple months ago only reading the 1st. 2, Beguiled (Dane & Angel) bk. 1 & Wanton (Alex & Celia) bk. 2 They being part of the PI series which was fantastic.  Mick (Caught in the act) bk. 3 links these 2 & the next 2 in the series (Treat her right & Mr. November) bks. 4 & 5.   <br /> <br />Men of courage (Ethan & Rosie) is next, although I didn't know was linked to those above at the time of reading it.  Then we have \\"Riley\\".  Finally I get to the last book in this anthology \\"Uncovered\\" (Harris & Claire). <br /> <br />This one had me in stitches laughing.  Harris is called to a fire.  His friend Ethan firnds a box of photo's of a naked lady presumed to be posing.  Because Ethan is married Harris takes them of him.  Claire, Harris's neighbour sees them & is mortified.  The next day when Claire gets to work for Dane & Alex she finds Harris there with the pictures.  There are also some handwritten notes about Harris.  Harris is desperate to find out who the mystery woman is.  None of the men can understand Claire's reaction to seeing them spread out over the office.  Dane & Alex even have them blown up to see if they can find some distinguishing marks. <br /> <br />It is only when Angel & Celia go into the office & see the pictures all over the wall that they recognise who it is.  Men are sometimes so thick, they can't see what's under there noses.  As this is happening Harris is about to go into the back office to stop them searching for her & Claire is about to walk into the shop.  When she does the look they give her is pricless.  They just don't know where to look.  Harris is mortified as well as angry.  3 other men have seen those pictures of Claire & he is going to marry her.  2 of the men are her bosses.  How will he live this down.  They are by this time shouting all the personal details of what has gone on the night before & everyone can hear.  Alex buts in a couple of times while they are still shouting. <br /> <br />After getting his presumptions wrong Harris finds out its an ex of Clair's who took the photos without her knowledge & that he has been doing it to others as well. <br /> <br />Lori says in the front of this book that \\"Uncovered\\" is the funniest book she has wrote & she is right.  In future whenever I think about it it will have me cracking up. <br /> <br />The next in the series is Buck's story in \\"The truth about cats & dogs\\".  My copy shoud be here next week.

She recognises him as her attacker but he lies & tells her is was his twin who has left the country in the night. He then writes to Nick telling him he has found him a wife, Elenore & that he must marry her or he would be cut-off. Nick comes home & does as Kit tells him. He marries Elenore. <br />  <br /> In the mean time Nick is embroiled in a Napoleonic plot or so he thinks. It is a plan by his mistress to get her revenge on him for leaving her 2 years before. Therese's behaviour is totally ruthless. She kidnaps his wife. She watches Nick as he destroys any love Elenore felt for him by telling her he is leaving with Therese, knowing Therese is watching & listening, but he says something strange to her & Elenore wonders. Then disapears for months. <br />  <br /> A fantastic story. The other rogues are brilliant especially Lucien. I have just started his story & it is expolosive.

You see Sookie has a problem, she can read peoples minds.<br />This book has everything you want from a vampire story, it has intrigue, eroticism &amp; it holds you from the 1st. page right through to the last. And leave you wanting more...	2002-10-18

I came accross Lynn's book stardust of yesterday &amp; fell in love with her books.  I don't need to read a review before I decide to buy her books, I buy because Lynn has written it.  Her name on a cover of a book is enough for me.<br />I love books that come in series &amp; Lynn's do.  With the Macleod's &amp; the Piagetts you have two wonderful families &amp; a lot of wonderful books to read.<br />This story is about Elizabeth who is sent back in time to medieval Scotland &amp; meets the Laird Jamie Macleod.  The story is wonderful &amp; very funny, not to mention very sensuous. It will have you laughing out loud at some of the antics they get up to.<br />Thank you Lynn for giving us this series.	2002-10-18

It is the first of Angie Ray's books I have read, but it won't be the last.  The twist at the end of the story was brilliant.  Usually I can tell what is going to happen, but I love it when I am surprised by some twist in the tale, like this one.<br />After finishing I checked on the other book I have by Angie \\"My lady in time\\".  I was wondering after seeing the name of the hero of that book and where it is based if the two books are in some way connected.  Can some one please tell me in what order I should have read them?  I think My lady in time was released before A knight to cherish.  I'm going to have to read My lady to find out if i'm right.<br />I tried to find out from Angie's website but the url in the book does not seem to be working.  I would appreciate it if someone could send me her website address, I want to find out about all her other books.  She is a marvelous writer and I for one will keep looking out for her books.	2002-05-06

It is not for the faint-hearted.  I have never read a book with so much graphic detail as this has.  It is a story of two deeply scared people, not just physically, but mentally.  Anne and Michael, through their passion heal each other and learn to love each other.   There are some extreamly horrifying parts to the story near the end of the book, which does not detract from the story.  In fact it makes everything clear to the reader as to why Michael is like he is.  He has a lot of dark secrets from his childhood.  They become clearer as the book progreses.

A little problem of 1000+ years between these two very passionate lovers doesn't make any difference, the fact that Rain had to travel back in time only adds to the storyline.

She does a brilliant job of saving him using accipuncture in place of anasthetic.<br />Ubbi, a servant of Selik's is an absolute delight.  He thinks Rain is an angel sent from god to save his master.  They get into a lot of scrapes especially when they kidnap Selik for his own good.  Though he doesn't see it that way.  <br />After being captured and tortured, Selik comes to an arrangement with the King and is alowed to stay in Britain.  Selik comes after Rain.  He is told by Adam that Rain is going home to her own time if she can, so he chases after her in the hope of persuading her to stay.

The scene on the train where Etienne and Harriet are making  love in a cofin is one of the most memorable parts of the book.  There are  many such instances similar to this one.<br />Apart from being another funny  story, it is an intensly passionate story I have ever read.  The sex is red  hot.

Sandra is fast becoming one of my most favorite  authors (LYNN KURLAND being my favorite).  I howled at her dumb blonde  jokes and her arrow-back (aerobics)classes with the servants.  <br />Selene's  character is just right.  She is not the typical blonde Southern Belle, she  is a very feisty, passionate woman, even if she doesn't think so.  You'll  be in stitches at some of the things she get's up to.  <br />She helps the  women on the plantation with their problems - especially where it concerns  their men.  She tells them about a sexual position called The Perfect Fit.   The morning after the women had learned about it was hillarious.  The men  were walking about with smiles like the cat who got the cream.  Everyone  knew what they had all been up to the night before.  This book is so  incredibly funny, you'll die laughing.<br />James is a dream come true for any  woman, (look at the cover and see what I mean).  He is just as passionate  as Selene.  When they make love the pages just sizzle with the  heat.<br />Sandra has wrote a very funny and a very passionate book.  The  other characters in the story are wonderful, with the exception of Victor  and James' wife Giselle.

I  thought the heroine Melisande was going to be like Laura from THE  SCORCERER'S LADY, but I couldn't have been more wrong.<br />I was spellbound  by this story.  Flynn Patrick was a man to die for.  Melisande was not the  prim and proper 19th. century young lady who denied the passion she felt  for Flynn.  <br />This story is one of the best I have ever read.  There is no  way you can predict what is going to happen until near the end, which is  what I loved about this book.  I loved being surprised.<br />This book is  definately a keeper.  I can see myself rereading it over and over again.   It is a shame it had to end.  Please Elaine write a sequel to it.  Perhaps  you could explain why, what happened to him as a child did happen to him.   I'd love to know.	2000-08-05

A story about Jenny when she grows up would be wonderful.   She is so like her father.  <br />It is so diferent from THE BRIDE FINDER and  THE NIGHT DRIFTER, but this does not detract from the story.  It is so like  King Arthur and Camelot, a magical time.<br />Well done Susan on another great  read.  I do hope there will be a sequel.	2000-08-03

It was lovely to see Anatole and  Madeleine  again, even if it was for a short time at the end of the  book.<br />I do hope they are in more of Val's story (VALENTINE'S  BRIDE).<br />Thank you Ssusan for a wonderful, magical story.

There are very few authors who can grab and hold my attention, but Susan has with this story.  It is a wonderful love story with two powerful people set right in the middle of it.  Anatole and Madeline are made for eack  other, even though they don't think so in the begining.<br />They have to  overcome many obsticles to come to realise they love each other and finding  they do they realise that love is strong enough to change the prophecy of  what must be.<br />The BRIDE FINDER is a very rare book with some wonderful  and not so wonderful characters.  The story will hold you right to the very  last page.  I was so sad when Roman, who was a very nasty member of the  St.Leger family died.  He finally made his peace with Anatole just before  he died.  They both hated each other from the day they were born, thanks to  Anatole's parents rejection of him.  Anatole's mother wished Roman was her  son because he has not inherited the St.Leger curse, like her own son has.   <br />Buy this book, you won't be disapointed with it.  I'm just about to  start the sequel to this story called THE NIGHT DRIFTER.  This one is about  Lance, son and heir to Castle Leger, one of Anatole and Madeleine's twin  son's.  I can't wait to finish it.<br />For those of you who want to know if  there will be a third book in the series, there will be.  It is called  VALENTINES BRIDE ( Lance's twin brother) and will be released in the winter  of 2001.  There is a sneak preview at the end of THE NIGHT DRIFTER.  I  can't wait.....	2000-07-28

You just  cannot predict the end with any certainty.<br />This story is so beautifully  written.  It will make you laugh, cry and believe in witches.  A wonderfull  story.<br />I can't wait to read Dagon's story im MAGICAL MOMENTS.  If it is  half as good as this one it will be brilliant.  Well done Donna.	2000-07-26

Connor was wonderful, a man  to die for, but Laura is a great disapointment until the end.  If this book  had been set in the present day instead of Victorian Boston I think Laura's  character could have been changed for the better.  <br />She would not have  acted the way most victorian ladies did.   She would have had a mind of her  own and been able to follow the dictates of her heart.  The book does pick  up even Laura when she accepts its Connor she wants and not that cold fish  Philip.  She does leave it a little late to tell Philip she won't marry  him.   At least she came to her senses in time virtually leaving Philip  standing at the alter.  <br />The other characters in the book were wonderful,  especially Aunt Sophie,  for a middle-aged victorian spinster she had a lot  more go in her.<br />I have just found out that Austin and Sarah have already  had a book written about them.  Unfortunately I did not know this until I  finished reading this book.  I would have liked to read their story first.   <br />I don't think that bringing someone from the past to the 19th century  works as well as if you bring them forward to the present day.	2000-07-10

This  story has everything you want, humour, passion, magic and love.  A sequel  to this book would be perfect.  I'd love to read about Jennifer and Dar in  Asgard, as well as the other secondary characters.  This book has the  potential to become a series.  Please do it Judy.

Nicholas is a man to die for.  You will adore him.  The tears were running down my face when Lauren found out Nicholas had died,  especially as she had warned him what would happen if he didn't take care.   Lauren finds her way back to her own time.   She is heavily pregnant with  Nick's child and collapses at her grandparents home.  After she has the  baby she finds that her contribution in the past has changed time in the  present.

Ferguson  tries to kidnap her but Nick gets to her and the baby before he  does.<br />This is a wonderful story.

Every time you think Rhys and Gwen are going to get together something happens to pull them apart.  It makes you wonder if they are fated ever to be happy together as they  deserve.  Gwen has to marry someone else and you think all is lost for  them, until fate takes a hand in their future together. This is one of the  sadest stories I have read of Lynn's, but saying that it is a wonderful  story.  Don't despair all will turn out alright in the end. I agree with  some of the other reviewers that Rhys's parents should have a book of their  own.  Their small part in this book was wonderful.  Please consider this  Lynn.  Well done.	2000-06-24

I won't spoil the story by telling you  the end, but it is not what you expect.  I shall definately be looking out  for more of Victoria's books to read in the future.  She is a fantastic  writer.

You can just imagine  it coming true.  I do hope she writes more books for the other people in  the book.  Zach's story would be great.  I do hope she keeps writing and  including characters from her other stories.  I know she has joined the  Mc'Cloud's and the De Piagets in The Christmas Spirits, but that book is  near impossible to get hold of.

The storyline was different to most time-travel books.  This one has the hero (ROLF) bought forward from the tenth to the twentieth  century instead of having the heroine go back in time.  The story is  hilarious, I have never laughed so much as I did reading it, especially at  some of Rolf's pronounciation of the words.  Merry-death(Meredith) is a  wonderful herione especially when Rolf is trying to put her in her place.   He is a real chauvanist but very lovable with it.

Terri continues the story but this time it is Maggi and Alex's son Douglas who is sent back to the middle ages.  It is great to  read about the characters inteviening 20yrs, since Maggie and Alex went  home.  I was so glad that Anice had changed from the spoilt brat that she  was in the first book.  I felt really sorry to find out what had happened  to her.  The ending was not what I expected it to be, but it was still very  good.  I do hope Terri will continue with the series.  It would be great if  she could give the other characters a turn like Lynn Kurland did with the  MacLeod's and the De Piaget's in STARDUST OF YESTERDAY and A DANCE THROUGH  TIME to mention just a couple of her books.	2000-05-07

It is not like any other time-travel books I have read.  The secondary characters in the story are well developed and believable.  I  felt so sorry for the treatment Maggie recieved frrom Anice (Alex's  betrothed).  I wished she would give her a good slapping instead of taking  all the snide remarks from Anice and her maids.  She was just a spoilt  little brat who thought she was better than everyone around her especially  Maggie.  Anice did change at the end of the book when she realised that the  Alex she thought was betrothed to wasn't her Alex, but an imposter.  I  thought the real Alex who prefered to be called Sandy was a perfect match  for Anice.  He was just as bad as she had been to Maggie.  This book is a  great read and I can't wait to read the sequel to this book.  I highly  recommend it to any time-travel fans out there.  Keep up the good work  Terri.	2000-05-07
