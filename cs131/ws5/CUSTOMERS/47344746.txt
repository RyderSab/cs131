Am daunted, in the task of writing a review, by the fact that the previous reviewers all got it exactly right!  The late Kenneth Koch (1925-2002), whimsical poet, teacher, and enthusiast for the evangel of poetry here gives us a book ideally suited for any poet or reader from high-schooler to nonagenarian.<br />The first 135 pages of the book are something of an instruction manual, or an explanation of why poetry seems so strange at first.  He patiently explains the obvious : sound matters as much as sense; words have musical value; there is a &quot;poetry language&quot; -- or perhaps several poetry languages? -- that we discover through reading anything &amp; everything in sight.  He comes up with the happy comparison of poetry as language being put through a synthesizer!<br />He speaks of the need to build up a &quot;poetry base&quot; through much exposure to the poems of the past and present; he &quot;opens up&quot; the Wallace Stevens poem &quot;Anecdote of the Jar&quot; and makes enchanting a poem that irritated me on previous readings; he makes apposite remarks on revision and inspiration ...<br />The latter half of the book is a neat -- but not quite comprehensive, as Koch himself admits -- anthology of poetry from across the globe, &amp; encompassing three millennia.  From Li Po (Li Bai) to Lorca, from Sappho to Snyder, from Ovid to O'Hara.  Senghor and Cesaire are alongside Ashbery and Wallace Stevens.  Marvell and Shakespeare, Whitman and Hopkins and several in between, before and after.  Most of the poems are suffixed by a comment by Koch of less than a page (except for Keats's &quot;Bright Star&quot; which he allows to shine by itself!).  Especially good, I thought, his brief note on the sonnet by George Herbert, &quot;Prayer,&quot; which I have been trying of late to memorize.<br />Excellent reading for the train, the waiting room, the bed, or whatever region of the house you call your workshop or study!!	2003-04-04

The volume begins with autumn and ends with spring. In between we have songs and sonnets and serene calligraphy, urbanity and sarcasm and protest against tyranny, we have childlike wonder at a distant star and the ultranecessary reminder that \\"not all matterings of mind equal one violet.\\"<br />We have clarity, we have acceptance of the universe as it appears:<br />now air is air and thing is thing:no bliss<br />of heavenly earth beguiles our spirits,whose<br />miraculously disenchanted eyes<br />live the magnificent honesty of space.<br />We have the bluejay as \\"beautiful anarchist\\" and the slender eulogy for \\"this man's heart\\" who was \\"true to his earth\\" and not interested in \\"anyone's world.\\" We have the famous (and to our mind unsplendid) jingle about \\"maggie and milly and molly and may.\\"<br />We have apothegms: \\"dive for dreams / or a slogan may topple you\\"; we have \\"first robin the\\" and his message \\"april hello,\\" and we have the limitless grace of \\"out of the lie of no.\\"<br />Poems 87 through 95 -- with perhaps one exception -- are immortal. It bears repeating: immortal.<br />There are a few typographical poems that don't quite work, and a few ballad-jingles where Cummings conceals his meaning rather too well, but all in all, the book called \\"95 poems\\" is a splendour and an ineffably graceful achievement, reminding us that:<br />--saharas have their centuries,ten thousand<br />of which are smaller than a rose's moment<br />(and, from the same poem, the 11th)<br />... there is a time for timelessness	2003-01-06

With pages four-by-six, and its light weight, it is a very convenient and &quot;carry-with-able&quot; publication of the Scriptures.<br />Are there quibbles?  The reviewer deplores the absence of the Apocrypha from most paperback mass-market Bibles, and finds two or three aspects of the translation less than pleasantly resonant (&quot;compact&quot; in Psalm 122; &quot;weaned&quot; in Psalm 131; &quot;most assuredly, I say unto you&quot; instead of &quot;Amen, amen&quot;).  But the New King James Version -- theeless and thouless -- remains among the best of modern translations; it has fluent cadences that do not militate against the familiar and the traditional.  It is comparable in its solemnity, in its seriousness, in its respectfully poetic renderings to the Revised Standard Version (RSV) and the New International Version (NIV).  Readers who need the Jacobean pronouns and verb-forms may disagree.<br />The words of Christ are printed in red, or a kind of off-red, that is pleasantly emphatic without assaulting the eye.  In the very back, there is a chart for daily readings, and a glossary of terms (both familiar and unfamiliar).  Allow us to provide the NKJV version of Psalm 8, so that the prospective buyer might better discern if this be the aptest translation :<br />&quot;O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth, Who have set Your glory above the heavens!<br />&quot;Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.<br />&quot;When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him? For You have made him a little lower than the angels, and You have crowned him with glory and honor.<br />&quot;You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen -- even the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea that pass through the paths of the seas.<br />&quot;O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the earth!&quot;<br />[Note, however : the text of the Psalms in this NKJV is written as verse, not as prose.]<br />For students and commuters, for inveterate readers and frequent flyers, for travellers and contemplatives -- this edition is highly recommended : for its conscientious translation, and its convenient portability, and its gloriously unprohibitive cost!

It contains the magnificent sequence 'Squarings,' and a continuation of his Glanmore sonnets.  The craftsmanship impeccable, the voice down-to-earth.<br />We remember especially his sonnet on Lent in which the poet deals with 'A fasted will marauding through the body,' and the poem &quot;Wheels within Wheels,&quot; where a child spins the pedals of an inverted bicycle and notes &quot;The way the space between the hub and rim / Hummed with transparency.&quot;  Note the unobtrusive assonances, &amp; the exact right words.<br />In one of the twelve-line poems of 'Squarings', Heaney counsels himself and other poets: 'Do not waver / Into language.  Do not waver in it.'  In this sequence, it is Heaney's happy accomplishment to have heeded that counsel in an exemplary fashion.  Driving through an avenue or tunnel of trees, arching over a quarter-mile stretch of country road, Heaney sees the trees as 'Calligraphic shocks / Bushed and tufted in prevailing winds.'  Could Thomas Hardy or Wallace Stevens have done as well?<br />Talking about it isn't good enough,<br />But quoting from it at least demonstrates<br />The virtue of an art that knows its mind.	2002-07-25

The language does not falter.<br />If the price of a hardcover book proves prohibitive, one might fly to the nearest bookstore, pluck &quot;The Painted Bed&quot; from the shelves, and sit on a chair or a patch of carpet and receive these words as one might receive the language of a liturgy.  The stations of Hall's grief are composed of stately phrases and living words.  Few books of poetry can be described with justice as necessary to acquire and to absorb; Hall's collection of elegies is such a book -- vital in the sense of necessary, and in the sense of helping one to live.	2002-04-29

It is a journal-like chronicle of Waldron's contact with one of the more energetic minds of the age, a glimpse into the impressions of a humbly astute reader as he encounters Merton's thought in poetry and prose.<br />The book assumes a familiarity with the works of Merton, but readers who have encountered only two or three Merton books need not fear: Waldron's style is accessible and congenial, sometimes surprisingly, pleasantly conversational. He speaks as one reader to another, one spiritual explorer to another, confident that we will catch his enthusiasm not only for Merton, but for poetry in general.<br />As we see Robert Waldron sift through the compendious opus of the celebrated monk, making choices about which poems to present in his lecture, which portions of the prose to incorporate, we see him remembering when he first encountered Merton, we get brief commentary on how the work affected him (we echo his praise for the poetic prose in \\"A Vow of Conversation\\" and share his befuddlement at the attempted innovation of \\"Geography of Lograire\\"); we receive a sense of Merton's influences, and are pointed in the direction of his kindred spirits. He is compared, briefly and sagely, to another Catholic author and diarist, the late Henri Nouwen -- the differences being highlighted, as well as the similarities.<br />The life of Merton is generously assessed: the monk is lauded, justly, for his refusal to abandon his Cistercian life at a time of much turbulence for Church, nation, and the monk himself. His explorations into Buddhism are seen as evidence of a magnanimously ecumenical spirit; his affection for a Louisville nurse, as a humanizing moment that broadened and made tender the heart and soul of the monk. (We are offered a small but moving excerpt of one of the \\"Eighteen Poems,\\" written during the days when monk and nurse were often in each other's company. It might be worth noting that \\"Learning to Love,\\" volume 6 of Merton's journals, contains three or four excellent poems from this time.) Merton's sometimes uncritical enthusiasm for the politics of the left is not dealt with extensively, as Waldron's concern here is with the contemplative, creative, and poetic aspects of Thomas Merton's life-work.<br />\\"Walking with Thomas Merton\\" is the culmination of a lifelong enthusiasm for Robert Waldron, and he manages to convey, charmingly and disarmingly, why Merton's poems and prose fascinate him, and just might fascinate us. Merton's poems (and all fine poetry, as Waldron can attest, being an English teacher) cause us to pause from the hustle and hullaballoo, and gently urge us to pay attention to the minute particulars we often overlook, to go with the poet to a quiet space and re-create ourselves. Waldron baptizes (literally, immerses or plunges) himself in the poetry of Thomas Merton, that he might better speak forth the word (praedicare verbum) to his September retreatants. That we are allowed a glimpse of the retreat via the book's final pages, and to be alongside Waldron as he prepares for it, is a significant blessing.

Poetry and prose, comic and tragic, detective-novel and devotional literature, are here placed side by side, each selection placed in context by a short introduction by Waite (how he came to encounter the book, why the writing means so much to him).  It is an ode to the joys of reading, a paean in praise of the written word, and a book to own.  A book, moreover, that leads us to other books!<br />The books are of three kinds: (1) books given to Waite by his captors in Beirut; (2) books Waite remembered from earlier years, &amp; that he wished he had on hand in his cell; (3) books he discovered after his release.  Sometimes the categories overlap.  Waite once drew a penguin for one of his guards, who was buying English books second-hand, and the guard came back with a Penguin Books edition of 'The Brothers Karamazov'!<br />Selections from the Book of Common Prayer are here, with short readings from the Quran; Hilaire Belloc's Cautionary Tales (childhood rhymes about misadventurous lads) &amp; a snippet from Cellini's autobiography; a comically earthy snippet of Herodotus (Herodotus funny?  Who knew?  Waite did!); a sinister few pages from Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon.&quot;  The Catholic writers Bede Griffiths and Carlo Carretto are present, as well as Harry Williams, a 20th-century Anglican (new to us) writing on the Resurrection in a lucid, unhackneyed, &amp; heartwarming manner.  Other divines include Hubert Northcott, an Anglican monk, and Kallistos Ware, the Orthodox bishop.<br />There is Betty Smith's &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; and Michael Innes's &quot;Appleby's End&quot;; there's part of a mystery by Dorothy Sayers in which Lord Peter Wimsey utters the most extraordinarily surreal bits of dialogue (Frasier Crane on acid?); there is Belloc again, and William Styron, detailing mishaps during travels through Italy; also, Susan Howatch, Hermann Hesse; Stephen Spender (a poem and a lapidary few paragraphs from his autobiography).  And of course, there is John Bunyan (and Waite's tale of the postcard).<br />This is a book in which the good-humoured and genial personality of Terry Waite meshes wonderfully with the very fine selections he has chosen.

Books	3	4	4	N	N	2.75 stars:  Abstruse &amp; obtuse	From page 110, part of Hardy's treatment of Dylan Thomas's early poem &quot;The Force that Through the Green Fuse&quot;:<br />'The topos of reflexivity is a figure in a poem which makes explicit what is implicitly being said throughout the poem about creativity in the largest sense of the word.'<br />Unquote!  Safe to say that this book can be skipped.  Even more of a displeasure than the occasional abstruseness of the prose, however, is Hardy's relentless intrusion of her own personality, her own politics, her own life story, into what is ostensibly a book about Dylan Thomas's prose and poetry.  In remarks about the poem &quot;If My Head Hurt a Hair's Foot,&quot; Hardy loftily proclaims that because of her ardent feminism, she had qualms about a poem written by a man on the theme of pregnancy.  Well, forgive us, Mrs Hardy, but who cares?  Hardy praises Dylan Thomas's freedom from the insanity of nationalism (as if nationalism were the 20th century's foremost political evil!), but after raising the topic of politics (hardly germane to most of Thomas's work), she doesn't speculate as to whether Thomas's romanticizing of socialism and communism was particularly astute.<br />Finally, and this is the most damnable offense, she tells us absolutely nothing new about the poetry or prose of Dylan Thomas; she tells us nothing that could not have been gleaned from Ackerman's book WELSH DYLAN, or Paul Ferris's biography of Dylan Thomas, or William York Tindall's monumental (if sometimes complex) READER'S GUIDE TO DYLAN THOMAS, or the &quot;Twentieth Century Views&quot; collection of essays, edited by C. B. Cox.<br />Anything to praise about Hardy's work?  Well, there is evidence of intelligence in the writing (and a Richard Howard-like fondness for the French or Latin expression where a plain old Saxon one will do quite nicely); her exploration of the alliterative patterns in &quot;After the Funeral&quot; is first-rate; and she is willing to focus her scrutiny on poems and other works by Thomas that do not often benefit from critical attention (&quot;On No Work of Words,&quot; &quot;Once It Was the Colour of Saying,&quot; and the stories in &quot;Portrait ... Young Dog&quot;).  She does admire Dylan Thomas, has read him thoroughly, and her praises are never at the expense of an appropriate critical caution.  Still, not enough here to redeem what is ultimately an oppressively stodgy book, far from essential to the admirer of Thomas, and marred by the author's need to make pronouncements and self-admiring references that are neither relevant nor engaging.er works by Thomas that do not often benefit from critical attention (&quot;On No Work of Words,&quot; &quot;Once It Was the Colour of Saying,&quot; and the stories in &quot;Portrait ...

Harper and Anthony Walton, is reminiscent of a somewhat earlier anthology EVERY SHUT EYE AIN'T ASLEEP (also edited by Mr Harper and Mr Walton). The poems in the Vintage Book span three centuries, from Jupitor Hammon and Phillis Wheatley, to Carl Phillips and Reginald Shepherd; the 20th century, as one might expect, is most generously and gloriously represented. This reviewer has always prized the work of Countee Cullen and of Robert Hayden; and is grateful to make the acquaintance of Sterling A. Brown and Gwendolyn Bennett (her poem &quot;To A Dark Girl,&quot; written early in the last cnetury, is an irreducible greatness); Langston Hughes is shown to advantage in the selection of his work, many of the chosen poems being new to this reader. It shames us that hithertofore we had not been familiar with the work of Boston-born William Stanley Braithwaite. Claude McKay and Jean Toomer appear in these pages, McKay's finely wrought sonnets being familiar from other anthologies. New to us, and a gift for which the reader is grateful, is Margaret Walker's &quot;October Journey,&quot; of Keatsian loveliness.<br />Stylistic diversity exists here, and surfaces in a salient fashion as we reach the middle of the twentieth century: Gwendolyn Brooks (both formal and colloquial); Bob Kaufman (can we cavil at the omission of his fine eulogistic poem &quot;Afterwards, They Shall Dance&quot;?); Etheridge Knight (whose diamond-like haiku enliven our sense of the possibilities of the form); and the Nobel laureate Derek Walcott, whose &quot;Bounty&quot; is indeed a marvel. Raymond Patterson's baldly unsubtle imitation of Wallace Stevens (&quot;Twenty-Six Ways of Looking at a Blackman&quot;) strikes this reader as a culpable generosity of inclusion on the part of the anthologists.<br />We find merit in the poems of Audre Lorde and Lucille Clifton; Sonia Sanchez's piece urging nuclear disarmament does not affect us positively, on either a political or an esthetic level, a slack garrulity that is too long-winded to be a slogan and too formless to be a poem. Jay Wright, Michael S. Harper, Al Young and Toi Derricotte (almost exactly contemporaneous) fashion lyrics of beauty, ingenuity, toughmindedness and considerable appeal. We value Marilyn Nelson's poem (charmingly sardonic) called &quot;Emily Dickinson's Defunct.&quot; Yusef Komunyakaa, Thylias Moss, and Rita Dove -- justly renowned poets -- are in the Vintage Book (Komunyakaa a Pulitzer Prize winner in 1994, Dove a recent U. S. poet laureate). Nathaniel Mackey's poems display an unparalled intelligence and ability to renovate and renew the language; his work should be more widely known. Elizabeth Alexander cages wrath within formality in &quot;The Venus Hottentot&quot;, and is quite effective in her sequence of poems about Muhammad Ali. And finally, an autumnophile reviewer must congratulate Anthony Walton on the achievement of his lyric &quot;The Summer Was Too Long&quot;; great poetic force is also to be found in his poems on Thelonious Sphere Monk and Emmett Till.<br />In short, this is a splendid anthology, recommended to all. There are lapses into the ineffectual stridency of sloganeering; nonetheless, we venture to say that the reader will be nourished and fortified by the majority of the poems in the Vintage Book of African American Poetry.

There are times when he is as oblique within his traditional cadences as Emily Dickinson, but like that same poet, the words coruscate and are not cliches. What poet of sixteen, learning what poetry is, wouldn't benefit from a memorization of &quot;Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,&quot; or of parts of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;?<br />Wallace Stevens begins in the tropics and ends in the cold north; his two seasons as a poet are summer and winter; in both climates, he excels. Witness the formidable achievement of Crispin's voyages (&quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot;) for Stevens in summer, and later poems in blank couplets such as &quot;No Possum, No Sop, No Taters&quot; for Stevens in winter. In between, there is the marvelous tapestry of controlled whimsy and exquisitely orchestrated anarchy of &quot;Notes toward a Supreme Fiction&quot; where we have everything but the kitchen sink (caparisoned elephants, a flag whacking at the halyards, the President ordaining the bee to be immortal).<br />We all know &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot;; we might profit by reacquainting ourselves with &quot;Academic Discourse at Havana,&quot; &quot;An Ordinary Evening in New Haven,&quot; &quot;The Auroras of Autumn,&quot; &quot;The Dove in the Belly,&quot; and (forgive us if we do not record the full title, with its wince-worthy epithet, of the truly splendid sequence of small but glittering poems) &quot;Like Decorations in a Cemetery.&quot;<br />These poems really should slay the thoughtless notion that the pentameter is an insurmountable restriction for the modern poet, because we see that a poet who is hampered by such an alleged &quot;difficulty&quot; is really no poet at all. (It was Mr Cummings who said that no poet should venture vers libre until he has mastered the old cadences, stanzas, &amp; forms.) We really must ask ourselves if the more facile modes of composition are necessarily improvements over these (or any) lines by Wallace Stevens:<br />&quot;Panache upon panache, his tails deploy / Upward and outward, in green-vented forms, / His tip a drop of water full of storms.&quot;<br />Or the pasage in &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot; where we see the actor (poet) as &quot;A metaphysician in the dark [...] twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses.&quot;  Or yet again:<br />The old seraph, parcel-gilded, among violets<br />Inhaled the appointed odor, while the doves<br />Rose up like phantoms from chronologies.<br />An anthologist of poetry once called Wallace Stevens's universe &quot;solipsistic&quot;; but we demur at this term. It is evident that, in spite of the occasional impenetrability of meaning, the discursus without destination or the &quot;description without place,&quot; the missing gist or multitude of gists, the ideas hiding almost successfully behind a glitter-glatter of joy in the sounds of the words themselves, Wallace Stevens had a lifelong conversation with reality that helped to compose these marvelous concertos of the supra-quotidian. His &quot;pick of ebon, pick of halcyon&quot; rarely failed him as he plucked his antique string in an accord of repetition. There is sometimes a surfeit of color, an impression that the poems (however elegant) are all &quot;surface,&quot; and the tone can sometimes oppress; but this oppression, if possible, is salutary. Always in evidence, however, is a mind at work on the language, making an ineluctable music, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, consistently if not invariably enchanting:<br />. . . words of the sea,<br />Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,<br />And of ourselves and of our origins,<br />In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.cile modes of composition are necessarily improvements over these (or any) lines by Wallace Stevens:<br />&quot;Panache upon panache, his tails deploy / Upward and outward, in green-vented forms, / His tip a drop of water full of storms.&quot;<br />Or the pasage in &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot; where we see the actor (poet) as &quot;A metaphysician in the dark [...] twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses.&quot;  Or yet again:<br />The old seraph, parcel-gilded, among violets<br />Inhaled the appointed odor, while the doves<br />Rose up like phantoms from chronologies. <br />An anthologist of poetry once called Wallace Stevens's universe &quot;solipsistic&quot;; but we demur at this term.

There is sometimes a surfeit of color, an impression that the poems (however elegant) are all &quot;surface,&quot; and the tone can sometimes oppress; but this oppression, if possible, is salutary. Always in evidence, however, is a mind at work on the language, making an ineluctable music, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, consistently if not invariably enchanting:<br />. . . words of the sea,<br />Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,<br />And of ourselves and of our origins,<br />In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.	2001-11-29

This comparatively young, Western, Roman Catholic reader values this small purple book, A Manual of Eastern Orthodox Prayers, for its loveliness of language, its acute awareness of -- and profound humility before -- Divine Beauty, and its recognition (often absent in the language of modern Western Christianity) that God is Majesty, and that as we approach him, a feeling of awe is not malapert.	2001-10-14

This compilation of interviews with the monks of New Clairvaux, California is a fascinating contribution to that part of Catholic literature that might be called, risking impertinence, &quot;contemplative chic.&quot;  The books of Thomas Merton remain a great influence, and there exists a considerable interest in Cistercian spirituality and the cloistered life.  These ten monks, as diverse in ethnicity, personality, age, background, temperament, patterns of speech, as any ten persons you can find, share their views, their experiences, their recollections as to what prompted them to undertake the monastic adventure ... We have here a fairly down-to-earth lot, prayerful but not &quot;head in the clouds&quot; types, each of them conveying the necessity of perseverance and charity in a life that is anything but escapism!<br />There are three introductory chapters, explaining a little about Cistercian/Trappist history and detailing the schedule and the activities of your average monk (if there is such a thing!); these introductory chapters can probably be skimmed by those readers who have delved extensively into Merton or Pennington or who have made retreats at Trappist monasteries themselves.  Some of the books in the Bibliography proffered as Suggested Reading can be avoided (Finley's book &quot;Merton's Place of Nowhere&quot; being not terribly magnetizing) ... and there are times when we read the interviews that we find Mr Perata's attempts to reproduce the speech of the monks to be a bit labored, but there is humor to be found (an octogenarian Irish monk: &quot;readin', workin', &amp; just meditatin' ... you've gotta start usin' your mantra&quot;).  Some of the personalities &amp; histories in the interviews will be more attractive than others, but if the reader is interested in the Trappist life, &quot;The Orchards of Perseverance&quot; will be a welcome addition to the personal library.

To read this book is to take one's place with St John the Evangelist, St Mary Magdalene, and the Mother of God under the shadow of the Cross.  We read with what relentless fury, with what dehumanizing atrocity,  the secular persecutors of the Church treated the priests, religious &amp; layfolk.  The section on the Spanish Civil War was especially eye-opening &amp; horrifying:  a needed corrective to histories that have been told from the skewed standpoint of the Left.  The luminous examples of Miguel Pro of 1920s Mexico, of Charles de Foucauld in 1916 North Africa, of Oscar Romero and others, will inspire any reader.  They are not double-minded souls, but lovers of God's law.  The Communist atrocities in Albania and Rumania are particularly reprehensible and sickening, the tortures devised quite hellish.  We are angered at the comparative silence of other historians when denouncing the evils that came from these nations.<br />The history (not comprehensive, the author admits, in spite of the subtitle which the publisher insisted upon) takes us to the days of Solidarity in Poland, through Korea, Vietnam, and China, through martyrs of the Idi Amin era in Uganda, and the awesome example of the seven Cistercian Trappists in Tibhirine (Our Lady of Atlas), Algeria, who were compelled to surrender their lives in 1996.  In the chapter on Vietnam, Cardinal Francis X. Nguyen Van Thuan tells of his days in Communist prisons.<br />&quot;Is thy steadfast love declared in the grave, thy faithfulness in Abaddon?  Are thy wonders known in the darkness, thy saving help in the land of forgetfulness?&quot;  Robert Royal answers the psalmist's plaintive questions (from Psalm 88) in the affirmative.  &quot;The Catholic Martyrs of the Twentieth Century&quot; is a harrowing account which can dishearten, and cause us to hate what is evil more than we love what is good, but the unwavering confidence and hope of these scores of Christian martyrs -- from St Maximilian Kolbe to the Vietnamese Redemptorist who would banter with the saints in heaven -- will almost certainly inspire and fortify.of these scores of Christian martyrs -- from St Maximilian Kolbe to the Vietnamese Redemptorist who would banter with the saints in heaven -- will almost certainly inspire and fortify.	2001-08-19

His performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Old Vic is legendary, and he was justly lionized.  We learn more than we ever knew about some of the figures in those early days:  Mrs Patrick Campbell, Edith Evans, Sybil Thorndike, Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies.  Of course, the legacy of his mother's side of the family, the Terrys, was continued in Sir John (his great-aunt Ellen Terry was the actress of her age, &amp; recipient of many tributes from, among others, Oscar Wilde).  We learn that the family name &quot;Gielgud&quot; is Polish, and was originally &quot;Gielgaudski.&quot;<br />There is the expected contrasting of Sir John with Laurence, Lord Olivier; and in Croall's book, Olivier does not come off very well, intensely competitive to the point of being resentful, brash to the point of arrogance.<br />We learn of Gielgud as director for many stage productions, and the ideas that bubbled forth from him with an ebullient profusion that proved vexing to many actors, bewildered by many changes suggested and usually retracted; but none (or very few) of the actors who worked with him in this capacity doubted his good intentions, or his dedication.<br />We learn of Gielgud's arrest in 1953, shortly after his knighthood, for &quot;the importuning of male persons for immoral purposes.&quot;  We need not be ardently progressive to deplore the atmosphere in England and elsewhere during that time; and we cannot help but admire the grace &amp; the humility with which Gielgud, supported by many friends in the theatre, handled the distressing episode.<br />We learn of Gielgud's frequent collaborations with Sir Ralph Richardson, a partnership that lasted until Richardson's death in 1983, and encompassed material from Shakespeare to Harold Pinter; we see Gielgud working with Alec Guinness and Richard Burton in the early stages of both men's careers; we are witness to the Gielgud/Burton collaboration on a production of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; Burton as Hamlet and Gielgud as director, and the almost uncritical admiration that the younger man had for the older.<br />We learn of Gielgud's innumerable -- mostly unmalicious -- conversational gaffes, usually generated by his forgetting who was in the room or who he was talking to.  Sir John became known as &quot;the London Brick Factory&quot; for dropping so many conversational &quot;bricks.&quot;  Once when dining with a friend named Eddie Knoblock, Sir John was spotted by someone in another part of the restaurant; this &quot;someone&quot; waved hello, and sat down.  Gielgud turned to his dining companion and said, &quot;Thank God he didn't join us; he's a bigger bore than Eddie Knoblock.&quot;<br />Mostly, we are reminded of John Gielgud's formidable accomplishments in Shakespeare, and his fluency in speaking verse.  It was Alec Guinness who described Gielgud's voice as &quot;a silver trumpet muffled in silk.&quot;<br />The first three-fifths of Jonathan Croall's biography deal with the first 40 or 45 years of Gielgud's life; many of the actors mentioned have since faded from prominence or from memory, as have a few of the plays.  Whereas John Simon in his New York Times review says that Croall's book is perfectly proportioned, this reader was eager to get to the 1950's and beyond, when Gielgud played in films both good and bad (&quot;Arthur&quot; and &quot;Providence&quot; among the good; &quot;Scandalous&quot; and &quot;Caligula&quot; among the bad), always imbuing the role at hand with a seemingly effortless elegance.  Characteristically, Gielgud spent his ninety-sixth and last birthday working.  It was indeed a life immersed in acting, if not precisely &quot;a theatrical life.&quot;  And for all the accomplishments and justly rendered honours (including the Gielgud Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue), Arthur John Gielgud played his part with grace &amp; an admirable humility.cting, if not precisely &quot;a theatrical life.&quot;  And for all the accomplishments and justly rendered honours (including the Gielgud Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue), Arthur John Gielgud played his part with grace &amp; an admirable humility.	2001-08-11

Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and anyone who recognizes the Virgin as &quot;the mother of holy hope&quot; (Sirach 24) will be deeply moved by this fairly slender but devout volume.<br />There are times when Jacob of Serug seems to repeat himself in the fashion of much ancient poetry; nonetheless, the repetitions rarely give the impression of being gratuitous.  The mysteries explored in these four homilies (each homily a poem of more than 20 pages) are the Annunication, the Visitation of Mary to Elizabeth, and the Dormition of Mary.  A section of Homily 1 speaks of Mary as the New Eve, restoring grace to fallen humanity.  And from Homily 3:<br />&quot;O cloud of mercy, which is full of hope for all the world, all the earth which had been ravaged was pacified by it.<br />&quot;O ship of riches in which the Father's treasury was sent to the poor in a needy place and it enriched them!<br />&quot;O field, which without a ploughman yielded a sheaf of life, and all creation that had been needy was satiated by it.<br />&quot;O virginal vine, which though not pruned gave a cluster, behold by whose wine creation, which was mourning, rejoices.<br />&quot;Daughter of poor ones, who was mother to the only rich One, behold whose treasures are lavished on mendicants to enrich them.&quot;	2001-07-13

She writes with a crackle and snap that can be endearing or enervating, depending on her topic.  The story is familiar: a child of the 60s discovers that religion isn't just for octogenarian bishops, it's for cool people like you and me.  Cool = progressive, in case we haven't learned that by now.<br />There are passages that should be read aloud to a friend or relative or spouse or captive listener, to be fully appreciated.  On substance abuse, Lamott combines the wisdom of the Serenity Prayer with the savagely funny humor of Denis Leary.  Truly memorable.<br />If we read this as an autobiography of a funny &amp; fascinating gal, we won't be disappointed.  But if we're looking for a faith that transcends the narrow, doctrinaire confines of hollery redhamite progressivism, we probably won't find it in &quot;Traveling Mercies.&quot;<br />When Lamott writes about abortion, she is ardently pro-choice, as might befit someone whose first child succumbed to a &quot;legal medical procedure.&quot;  But her detailing of the after-effects of that procedure could be used as material in a pro-life argument.  Also, witness her reluctance when counseled by a clergyman to end her second pregnancy in a similar fashion.<br />I wanted to throw this book across the room when Lamott describes a man being mean to his dog and says it was the most heartless, brutal, inhumane thing she had ever witnessed.  Then she goes on, flippantly, casually, to detail how she once grabbed her child with such force that her fingernails became embedded in his forearm.  But it was all right, because she didn't mean it.  You see, Anne Lamott is one of the cool people, and cool people don't do mean things.  (We could ask which is the more inhumane action: striking a dog with a stick or dismembering a gestating baby, but this rhetorical question might force some people to think.  Heaven forbid that persons who are unaccustomed to serious cogitation about moral truths should be forced to think about these things.)<br />There's something endearing, even to this curmudgeon, about Lamott's wisecracks &amp; dreadlocks; her voice is neither omniscient nor Olympian, but she is always ready to give an opinion, and sometimes we find the opinion disagreeable.  We're glad to have read &quot;Traveling Mercies,&quot; but also glad to have bought it at a used bookstore.  There's a fine line between the endearingly hip and the gratingly flippant, and Lamott crosses this line dozens of times, with almost reckless abandon.rious cogitation about moral truths should be forced to think about these things.)<br />There's something endearing, even to this curmudgeon, about Lamott's wisecracks &amp; dreadlocks; her voice is neither omniscient nor Olympian, but she is always ready to give an opinion, and sometimes we find the opinion disagreeable.

It is a warmly affectionate, up-close, well-informed, down-to-earth readable series of vignettes dating from 1969 to the Jubilee Year.  Ambassador Flynn has an advantage over other commentators who might be imprisoned in their political dichotomies or perpetually harking back to more &#34;progressive&#34; days:  he understands John Paul II, and he understands Catholicism.<br /><br />We see Flynn's first encounter with Cardinal Wojtyla in a Polish Church in South Boston; we see the jubilation in Southie and elsewhere over Wojtyla's election as pontiff in 1978; we see the dismay over the assassination attempt in 1981 (Flynn was lecturing at a Boston community college at the time).  But the great bulk of this unbulky tome deals with the ambassadorial years of Ray Flynn at the Vatican, and the Clinton administration's sometimes uneasy diplomacy with the Holy See.  There is valuable behind-the-scenes material about the United Nation's Cairo Conference, and Flynn's delicately persistent urgings that the Administration take a less nihilistic position.<br /><br />We see His Holiness the Pope in Central Park singing Polish Christmas carols; we see him in St Louis denouncing the death penalty, both for convicted criminals and for innocent children in the womb.  We see a man of courage, of conviction, of self-deprecating humor, and a man whose smaller gestures (toward the elderly, disabled, and aggrieved) have been recorded by Ambassador Flynn with an unburdensome thoroughness.  We even have a papal footnote to St Augustine's memorable dictum that to sing is to pray twice!<br /><br />This personal portrait (we can call it a biography) should be read in conjunction with &#34;Witness to Hope,&#34;  George Weigel's admirable, but dauntingly mammoth, masterwork.onality, it is a curiosity of literature how often what one says of another seems descriptive of one's self.&quot;	2001-06-25

Milosz was residing in Paris when the correspondence began, but he soon moved to Berkeley, California, to teach at the university.  Merton was writing from Gethsemani, Kentucky, apart from one or two notes from his travel in 1968.<br />These are two alert minds, discussing everything from Communism to segregation, Catholicism to television, campus unrest to poetry.  We see in Milosz a salubrious skepticism toward some of Merton's progressive enthusiasms, and even a sharp critique of those who would equate the flaws of American capitalism with the grave sins of Stalinism (Milosz uses the word &quot;injustice&quot; rather pointedly).  During campus unrest at Berkeley, Milosz notes that the More Compassionate Than Thou seem to have compassion for everyone but &quot;squares.&quot;  Milosz is neither pacifist nor anarch, and in one or two instances provides a valuable counterpoint to Merton's views -- particularly on communism, which Milosz saw up close.<br />Interesting, to see the views of both men concur about the liturgical changes in the Catholic Church (not much enthusiasm for them); about confession, Milosz explains some &quot;problems&quot; he has had, and Merton gives us his views on what occurs during the Sacrament.  There is much about poetry -- one or two poems by each author are included -- and about a magazine which Merton edited in his final days, &quot;Monks Pond.&quot;<br />Mertonians will enjoy this volume, and even persons such as this reviewer, whose respect for Merton is not to be confused with discipleship or idolatry.  Milosz has a sharp mind, able to discourse with breathtaking ease about Marx, Hegel, and the heresy of Socinianism (?!) -- about the plight of four Polish writers nicknamed Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta -- about the spirit of the Sixties &amp; some of its less palatable side effects.

You won't find any knowledge or truth in C S Lewis, because C S Lewis is not Scripture.<br />There are some Scriptural admonitions that seem relevant at the moment, most notably Exodus 20:16 and Ecclesiastes 5:3.  And if we're thinking of sending any C S Lewis books to persons who are either incapable of understanding them, or eager for whatever reason to misrepresent what is found therein, we may just be in violation of Matthew 7:6.<br />C S Lewis does not claim equality between all religions; he claims, however, that there is sufficient similarity in the various creeds' understanding of the moral law as to make the moral law universally binding.  He chose the name of Tao to describe the moral law, because it is (unless we are mistaken) a Chinese word meaning &quot;the Way.&quot;  Lewis was fully conscious of Christ's declaration &quot;I am the Way&quot; and never exhibited -- in this work, or in any other -- the slightest sign of disagreeing with that.  He was no syncretist; he was no Taoist; he was no secular humanist; and he was no trousered ape incapable of understanding plain English!	2001-06-09

Happy is the sobriquet of the Mrs Nelson Rockefeller.  Also, in the first psalm, the immortal rendering \\"his leaf does not wither\\" has been made to read \\"its foliage never fades\\"; we do not believe that this change is an improvement.<br /><br />In Psalm 136, the refrain repeated throughout the psalm is given as \\"his love endures forever.\\"  We recall translations that have \\"mercy\\" instead of love, and prefer that particular rendering.  The Revised Standard Version has \\"steadfast love,\\" the modifier adding some strength to a noun that has been weakened by much misuse and use.<br /><br />In the Song of Songs, for \\"Osculetur me osculo oris sui,\\" the first verse of the Canticle, the REB gives us \\"May he smother me with kisses.\\" A feasible translation, but we prefer the cadence of the New International Version's \\"Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,\\" which seems to be more accurate.<br /><br />Also, in the Song of Songs, the verse that is traditionally rendered \\"terrible as an army with banners\\" is given by the REB as \\"majestic as the starry heavens.\\" Is there a justification for this rendering in the original Hebrew?<br /><br />We are very grateful for the inclusion of deuterocanonical books, often called the Apocrypha; some passages of Wisdom and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) being worthy of memorization. The Apocrypha are placed intertestamentally, to coin an adverb, between the Old and the New, although this reader would not have objected if these books had been reincorporated into the Old Testament, following the lead of the Vulgate.<br /><br />In the New Testament, we find a few quirks, but nothing akin to the cacophonies of the NAB.

Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) does not like much of the mischief that has occurred since the Council in the name of aggiornamento, and makes it clear that the Council was not a license to desacralize the sacred liturgy.  Many Church progressives enjoy depicting Ratzinger as a scowling fiend, as a martinet, as \\"God's Rottweiler.\\" Don't believe this hyperventilant hype; the current pontiff is a fine man and a first-rate thinker.<br /><br />Ratzinger demonstrates how a certain breed of liturgists -- tipsy on the spirit of the Sixties, and pathologically intent on \\"making it new\\" -- often claim to represent the interests of the poor and the unschooled, all the while running roughshod over their wishes. The simple faithful (as Cardinal Dolan once called them, the \\"meat-and-potatoes Catholics\\") are derided by the innovators for their naïvet&eacute;, their unsophistication, and their old-fashioned devotional practices. In fact, Ratzinger cites an instance where the poor parishioners of an Episcopalian church in New York City were instrumental in stopping the drastic \\"renovation\\" of a church they loved just the way it was.<br /><br />His Holiness has been called every name in the book by those who pride themselves on their tolerance. Read the Ratzinger Report, and discover the salutary catholicity of a true servant of God.	2001-05-13

Which we might not have done otherwise.<br /><br />We are perhaps entitled to disagree with a few of his notions, or argue that emphasis has been misplaced here or there -- but the reader who would not benefit in some way from Kreeft's engaging study is, I would venture to say, in a very small minority.<br /><br />We remember liking best the explication of the Song of Songs. The reader who is not stirred spi!ritually and intellectually by this part of the book, we believe, asymptotically approaches the inanimate.<br /><br />Have begun to read a fairly recent book by Dr Kreeft, his \\"Prayer for Beginners,\\" also published by Ignatius Press.

The journal entries and drawings serve to remind us that many persons between the ages of 14 and 18 are at the height of their creative powers, and write poems and draw sketches with an exuberant profusion.  The intimacy of the notes and letters (the written prayers to God) will remind some readers of the saints of old, and perhaps of the psalmist -- Rachel's poems and letters are touching in their absence of artifice or guile, and moving in their honesty about struggles with doubt and other temptations.<br />The book contains the memories and reminiscence of Rachel's parents, Darrell Scott and Beth Nimmo, and of Rachel's youth minister Lori Johnson.  The ideal reader will allow the narrative to take shape as it does, not chronologically in sequence, but as the memories come.  Not every reader will be familiar with the form of Christianity where the words &quot;fellowship&quot; and &quot;disciple&quot; are used as verbs, but to persons of an open mind and heart, this unfamiliarity should not prove a hindrance.<br />The primacy of focus is not on the brutal and senseless deeds of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold -- although their state of mind is discussed and briefly examined -- but rather of the life-affirming faith of Rachel Joy Scott, and a quite moving testament to her parents' belief that the slayings at Columbine were &quot;a spiritual event.&quot;  Highly recommended.  Inspiring and even challenging -- challenging the reader to accept the invitation of grace and to recognize the certain victory of good over evil.	2001-04-30

There are references made to the original Hebrew and to the canonical Greek of the Orthodox Church, and pertinent comparisons made to New Testament passages.  There is often a brief comment about the liturgical use of the psalm in question (morning or evening prayer, Easter or Great Lent, and so on).<br />While the ideal reader for Fr Reardon's reverent study would be Orthodox, and not unfamiliar with the liturgical Greek, &quot;Christ in the Psalms&quot; can be read, with profit, by Western Christians as well.  But beyond scholarship and ecclesial loyalty, a vigorous faith is needed; in Fr Reardon's words:  &quot;The Psalter has nothing to say to the worldly; it is not for the unconverted, the unrepentant.  It is, rather, the prayer book of those who strive for holiness of life and the unceasing praise of God.&quot;  (See the commentary on Psalm 4.)<br />The numbering of the Psalm follows the Septuagint.  Texts of the psalms are not included; Fr Reardon perhaps rightly assumes that the reader has a trustworthy translation on hand.  He generally devotes two pages to each psalm.  Most memorable, the comment on Psalm 51 (52), including an identification of the execrable Doeg the Edomite.<br />&quot;Christ in the Psalms&quot; is not a book to be zipped through; take two or three psalm-essays at a time.  These &quot;pastoral ponderings&quot; will be of profit only to those of an unhasty disposition.	2001-04-18

The Anglican bishop George Appleton was himself generous in compiling this book of prayers, taken largely from the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox traditions.<br />If you're a Roman Catholic, you will find in the Oxford Book of Prayer examples of liturgical language that are lovelier than any of the passages you have heard at a post-conciliar Mass.  For the Anglicans, there is Hooker and Traherne and Herbert of the earlier centuries, and Eric Milner-White, John Baillie, and Appleton himself for the twentieth century.  Orthodoxy is very well represented, with Eucharistic prayers, with anthems and hymns for vespers and mattins at various points in the liturgical year.<br />There is Cardinal Langton's immortal &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot; in both Latin and English.  There are a few poems, or snippets of poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins.  There are canticles by Alcuin of York, and prayers of Ghanaian fishermen, in happy juxtaposition.  There is a litany to the Holy Spirit (prayer no. 672) used by the ecumenical Taize community in France.<br />There is a moderately sized section of prayers from &quot;other traditions of faith,&quot; from Jewish to Taoist, Muslim to Baha'i, a gracious but not overly concessive tribute to religious pluralism (a prayer-book consisting solely of Christian prayers would perhaps be seen as triumphalistic), but there, some beauty and genuine feeling for the transcendent is often to be found.<br />As there are more than eleven hundred prayers in this admirably capacious anthology, any review of a few paragraphs is bound to fail in its attempt to convey the temper and the flavour of the book.  Let us therefore take one prayer at not-quite-random, no. 588, from the Syrian Orthodox Church:<br />&quot;Open to us, Lord, your great door; O Fountain of all mercy, hear our prayer and save our souls.  Shine upon me, Lord, and I shall be light like the day; I will sing your praise in light while I marvel; may the morning awaken me to the praise of your Godhead and I will pursue the study of your word all the day long.  With the day may your light shine on our thoughts and may it drive away the shadows of error from our souls.

You can read about Communism -- Sheen's chapter on this subject is a needed corrective to the historical lassitude that fails to convey the menace of this abominable ideology.<br /><br />There are anecdotes about FDR and about Humphrey Bogart. There are stories of conversions which Sheen helped bring to fruition; there is the note that the octogenarian archbishop received from a boy of fi!ve or six: \\"I hop you have a happy Birthday, and I hop you will be Pop.\\"<br /><br />\\"Treasure in Clay\\" gives us laughter and devotion, humor and courage, poetry and the Cross, and a fine tribute to John Paul II, newly elected as this book was being written.

There are a few mild epithets besprent throughout his prose, as if to remind us that Mr Poitier is not the Archbishop of Westminster. But he can tell a story, paint a scene with painterly skill, and fascinate his readers by speaking to them plainly, conversationally, frequently asking &#34;you know?&#34; or &#34;you follow?&#34; after he describes an event or puts forth a proposition about the human condition.<br /><br />We learn of Poitier's childhood in the Bahamas, the first ten years spent in the almost Edenic climate of Cat Island; we learn about his struggles in late adolescence, coming to the USA, encountering situations where the goodwill of others was not always conspicuous; we learn of his early career as an actor in New York City; we learn of harsh winters endured, of hard work that paid off.<br /><br />Poitier wishes ardently to convey the value of being true to one's convictions in the face of arduous and hostile circumstances; the dominant note of &#34;Measure&#34; is one of thanksgiving (to his parents and friends, especially), not of complaint. Of course, there are moments when a justifiable anger surfaces; over his treatment in an Atlanta restaurant in 1955, to cite one example.<br /><br />There are behind-the-scenes glances at many of his major films, not as in-depth as many readers might prefer, perhaps; but there is memorable advice given to Poitier by the actor/director John Cassavetes, and there is also the story of cast conflict in the theatrical production of &#34;A Raisin in the Sun.&#34; We get glimpses of the revered cinematic duo Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn -- and Poitier's comments here are illuminating and sharp. Unless we misread him, it was the ultraprogressive Hepburn who treated him with a certain hauteur, and the politically noncommittal Spencer Tracy who was more the regular guy.<br /><br />Speaking of ultraprogressivism, there are paragraphs in Poitier's book which praise Paul Robeson as being &#34;a stand-up guy on the issue of race,&#34; but Poitier would have his reader believe that the overtly pro-Soviet Robeson came under the scrutiny of the US government solely because of his advocacy of civil rights for African-Americans. It should neither surprise nor appal Poitier's readers that Robeson, the recipient of the 1952 Stalin Peace Prize, was regarded with suspicion by the Cold War American government. But here again, we see Poitier's loyalty to his friends.<br /><br />As for the subtitle of the memoir, hinting at an exploration of Mr Poitier's spirituality, it's very subtle: there was the casual Anglo-Catholicism of his childhood in the Bahamas, and the common belief on his island of &#34;unseen forces&#34; governing human affairs, forces not definable by theologians. If Poitier's own spirituality can be defined, it consists of a vigorous belief in the work ethic as exemplified by his tireless parents; a belief in liberality on the personal level (and, alas, leftism on the political level); a laudably fierce assertiveness when it comes to self-defense and defense of one's family; and a dogmatic fluidity that admits: the more we know, the less we know.<br /><br />There are political prescriptions in the seventh chapter which will resonate better with some readers than with others, but even persons whose political views do not coincide with Sidney Poitier's should be able to find in &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; ample evidence of grace, of good cheer, of bravery, and many other admirable qualities.l Robeson as being &#34;a stand-up guy on the issue of race,&#34; but Poitier would have his reader believe that the overtly pro-Soviet Robeson came under the scrutiny of the US government solely because of his advocacy of civil rights for African-Americans.

Laurie's book, &quot;Dylan Thomas's Wales,&quot; combines colour photographs of modern-day Wales with old black-and-whites of Dylan and Caitlin Thomas, Dylan's parents and children; the text is an accurate chronicle of the poet's life, from schoolboy mischief to the turbulence of his more famous years.  Laurie's tone toward her subject is one of deep respect, with a keen eye to Thomas's faults (usually described by Thomas himself, in the letters which Laurie excerpts).<br />There is, as there must be, a generous sampling of some of Dylan Thomas's more famous poems, the lines that echo in the brain and heart for twenty decades after you've read them.  Occasionally, the texts of the poems are almost undetectably inaccurate, a plural noun made singular or a definite article omitted, but these objections aside, Laurie has done a fantastic job in making the life of Dylan Thomas quite vivid, and in giving American readers a fairly good visual impression of the landscape in which Thomas was immersed.<br />A photograph from &quot;Welsh Dylan&quot; (Ackerman's book) that might have been included is that of the club-wielding chalk giant, etched into the hill of Cerne Abbas, a landmark that inspired Dylan Thomas's poem &quot;In the White Giant's Thigh.&quot;  But that photograph of a youthful Mrs Thomas clutching the hay to conceal her birthdaysuitedness (p 79) might be, for some, apt compensation.	2001-04-01

Each letter is exquisitely crafted, mostly humorous; but the correspondents occasionally treat of serious matters, both political and personal, in their shared dialect.<br />This volume is valuable because we get to see Merton at his least soapboxish and at his most warmly affectionate.  We are introduced to the quirky asceticism of Robert Lax, who was living in Kalymnos, Greece at the time these letters were written.  And we are re-introduced to a childlike joy in artistic creation (yes; letters can be art).<br />This selection of letters, however, is about to be supplanted by a more plenary collection of the Merton/Lax letters, published under the title &quot;When Prophecy Had a Voice,&quot; edited by Arthur Biddle.  But for those who would like a comparatively inexpensive introduction to these effervescently creative minds, outdoing each other in verbal brio, lexical panache, and poetical elan, the Catch of Anti-Letters might be a dandy place to start.	2001-03-28

The depression began with the sudden interruption of a close friendship, and the writing was motivated by the desire to emerge from this deep distress. The meditations average two to three pages in length and are often quite simple and lucid, with the gentleness of voice that we have come to expect from Henri Nouwen.<br /><br />There are some slight vexations in the style, a tin-eared gender-inclusivity, e.g., \\"God is faithful to God's promises\\" (p 4) and an over-use of the word \\"community\\" that seems generated by a fear of the word \\"church.\\" Nonetheless, we praise Nouwen's efforts to make these very personal meditations have a wide and general appeal.<br /><br />There are many beautiful and helpful meditations in this slender but enriching book, among them, \\"Love Deeply\\" (p. 59):<br /><br />\\"The pain that comes from deep love makes your love ever more fruitful.  It is like a plow that breaks the ground to allow the seed to take root and grow into a strong plant.  Every time you experience the pain of rejection, absence, or death, you are faced with a choice.  You can become bitter and decide not to love again, or you can stand straight in your pain and let the soil on which you stand become richer and more able to give life to new seeds.\\"<br /><br />For some readers, the content of \\"Inner Voice\\" may seem depressing, and for others, it may seem that Nouwen has gone overboard in trying to make his meditations universal (minimizing mention of the Catholic mysteries); however, this writing is a testament to the God-given strength of a man who has no strength of his own.  It represents a brave effort to cooperate with divine grace in overcoming a truly bleak mood in which the writer feels abandoned by the friend who was once so close.<br /><br />The merits of this book were not immediately apparent to me on a first, or even on a second, reading; but, having profited from Nouwen's other books (especially \\"The Only Necessary Thing,\\" \\"Heart Speaks to Heart,\\" and \\"Sabbatical Journey\\") I decided to give \\"Inner Voice\\" another chance.

The enchanting quality of the prose in Kathleen Norris's &quot;Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith&quot; far outweighs our sporadic vexation with the elasticity of Norris's theology.  A charming exploration of the &quot;buzzwords&quot; of the Christian faith, with occasional touches of progressive snobbery, as if she were saying, faith isn't just for functionally literate housewives or octogenarian bead-tellers, it's for people like you and me, college-educated readers of poetry who are turned off by the more moralistic exponents of Christianity.<br />But even if we differ with Kathleen Norris on one or two things, we cannot reprehend her evident love of the monastic tradition (this, from a Presbyterian), nor can we find fault with the mellow, benevolent tenor of her prose; reading this book gives one a sensation not unlike that of hearing the Anglican monks sing their vesperal antiphons at the Charles River monastery.<br />Women have contributed much to the literature of 20th century Christianity, whether it be Caryll Houselander, or Evelyn Underhill, or Dorothy Day, or Marianne Moore (whose book-reviews frequently got quite metaphysical!).  And there is a broad range of Christian apologetics by women:  what kinship do we find between, let us say, Mother Angelica and Rosemary Radford Ruether?  Kathleen Norris is between these two extremes, sometimes finding herself bewildered to be participating in the Christian liturgy at all!<br />When I was called for jury duty last January (a bitterly cold day in Boston/Cambridge, three degrees above zero), I brought this book, and four others, with me to the courthouse.  The graceless tedium of waiting, waiting , waiting, was leavened and lightened somewhat by the gracefulness of Norris's meditations.

John Brooks Wheelwright and Laura Riding are included, from the early 20th century, as is Raymond Roussel (a French precursor to anti-novelists, a specialist in parenthetical labyrinths, and endlessly detailed descriptions of bottle-labels).  We have, too, the doomed author of \\"Death's Jest Book,\\" the 19th-century poet Thomas Lovell Beddoes.<br /><br />These essays are engaging and readable, informed and informative without being pedantic.  There are anecdotes, too (about Riding, most notably, who is aptly diagnosed by Ashbery as \\"a control freak\\").  We notice that half of the authors are homosexual or possibly so, most either committed suicide or had a parent who did so, three were affected by mental problems, and the majority were ardent leftists (Riding being an exception).<br /><br />To this reader, the two Johns, Clare and Wheelwright, are the most immediately endearing, and David Schubert's disjunctive colloquial tone does fascinate.  Some of the comments about the gang of six do shed some light into Ashbery's curious methods:  Clare's mucky down-to-earthiness and Beddoes' elegant, enamelled \\"fleurs-du-mal\\" idiom both being \\"necessary\\" components of poetry, in Ashbery's view.  Some of Wheelwright's elastic sonnets have a Saturday Evening Post-type folksiness that is often found in Ashbery's own poetic inventions; Schubert's poems (in Rachel Hadas's words) \\"seem(ing) to consist of slivers gracefully or haphazardly fitted together.\\"  An aside: Look at the first two lines of Schubert's \\"Happy Traveller.\\"  Couldn't that be John Ashbery?  About Raymond Roussel, whose detractors accuse him of saying nothing, Ashbery mounts an impatient defence that reads like a self-defence: \\"If 'nothing' means a labyrinth of brilliant stories told only for themselves, then perhaps Roussel has nothing to say.  Does he say it badly?  Well, he writes like a mathematician.\\"<br /><br />We learn that Ashbery is not fond of E E Cummings, and he is unconvincingly semi-penitent of this \\"blind spot\\":  Cummings, with his Herrick-like lucidity, his straightforward heterosexuality, and his resolute nonleftism, would not appear to fit nicely into Ashbery's pantheon.

There are chuckleworthy phrases that rattle about the brain with a happy insouciance for several days after one has read the thing. \\"The oxymoron gets his rocks off\\" and \\"pink shrouds fell on the pansy jamboree.\\"  And we like going for the ride, even if we get a little dizzy and a little seasick. The \\"androgynous truths\\" bubble perkily to the surface, in a verbal universe where what matters matters as much as what doesn't matter.  We know a few of the magician's tricks, but there are always a few swerves and slides which we can't anticipate. The honey drips from a blighted bough -- or is it a bright and sprightly bough? -- and the housepets lap the gruel in their gaily-coloured bowls, and the narrator stands back and lets it all happen.  As with anything by Ashbery, there are unwholesome things and things from which the reader runs away, but we marvel at the ingenuity nonetheless.	2001-02-28

It presents Merton at his warmest, his most enjoyable, his most gregarious, his most humble.  Loyal to old friends and a willing correspondent with new friends, the Merton we find in &quot;The Road to Joy&quot; contrasts happily with both the austere champion of contemplative solitude and the dour progressive who often bristled under abbatial authority.<br />We have here letters to his Columbia professor/mentor Mark Van Doren, and the ever-whimsical wordplay-concoctions to his chum Robert Lax.  We have encouraging letters to a high-schooler in San Francisco, Suzanne Butorovich -- these, quite possibly Merton's most charming examples of epistolary writing.  We have letters to his New Zealand &quot;Aunt Kit,&quot; and letters to other family members upon learning of her drowning after a ferryboat sinking.  We have letters of pastoral counsel, one to an anguished homosexual; and we have letters thanking fans for their kind words, one in which Merton seems pleasantly surprised to be told that C S Lewis liked some of his books!  There is a letter to a Massachusetts high-schooler proferring the asked-for help on a term paper.  And there are letters about the events of the day, at the monastery and in the world at large.  A flavour of some naive sixties hippiedom in a few places, but no matter.<br />All manner of thing in this collection; surely, Merton at his gladdest and most endearing.  And even if we often tire of Merton after ten or more years of reading him, we can return to these letters and be reminded of what first drew us to this most compelling figure.	2001-02-28

This book consists of 59 short essays that will assist the Catholic as she or he struggles in the whirlwind of the modern world.  Written in 1954 or 1955, this gathering-up of observations and sententiae remains sharply relevant, even after nearly half a century.<br /><br />Archbishop Sheen does not preach a gospel of evasion, but neither is he a humourless rigorist.  During his lifetime, through a ministry in the media of both print and television, he likely dreached more souls than Cardinal Newman did.  In \\"Way to Inner Peace,\\" the believing Christian will find not only a challenge but perhaps a restoration to sanity and sanctity (arguably, the same thing).	2001-02-15

Nouwen does not get up on a soapbox, but he calmly records his opinions and his observations.  His compassionate, endearing manner is more effective than the blatantly propagandistic stance we might encounter elsewhere.  This is certainly four-star writing, but we reserve the right -- respectfully -- to dissent from Nouwen's dissentings.<br />These notes were made between two Septembers, 1995 and 1996; Nouwen's death occurred a few weeks after the final entry was made. We see his sympathy for Buddhism and for the current Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church; his fascination with the Olympics and with films about astronauts; his bemused comments on same-sex relationships (there is an ostensible endorsement of &quot;gay&quot; &quot;marriage&quot; will cause a few eyebrows to be raised).  We find him reading Matthew Fox, the renegade Dominican; we find him &quot;working out&quot;; we find him meditating in a shrine called The Empty Bell, built by friends in the back of their house; and we find him celebrating the Eucharist in many domestic and companionable settings.<br />Nouwen's travels take him to California and New Mexico, Holland and Ireland, Watertown and Peapack, Freiburg and Toronto.  He speaks warmly of his friends in the Episcopalian communion, the clergywoman Margaret Bullitt-Jonas and the clergyman turned politician Bob Massie.  There is much an illumination of Nouwen's relationship with his aging father, whom he visits during the course of this year; there are many glimpses of Nouwen's liberality and liberalism; there is a sense of his ceaseless activity and his desire to learn more and do more up till the very end.<br />The Crossroad Publishing Company is not renowned for producing books that are unswervingly loyal to the Catholic magisterium; however, this book has considerable appeal.  With the caveat that, perhaps, it is not for everyone.	2001-02-13

From the ineffaceable early work to the effervescence of the later, from the casual perfection of his songs, to the dark grandeur of &#34;The Age of Anxiety,&#34; Auden's poetry enriches and helps one to live.<br /><br />It was the late Joseph Brodsky who said that if there were no churches or religions, a religion could be founded on the writings of W H Auden.  That is stratospherically high praise, but we see what he means.<br /><br />Auden's prosodical confidence, his ease with the most difficult of forms, reminds one of an Olympic gymnast.  His sobriety and skepticism, his sharp eye and his good cheer, his tone veering from the outrageous in one poem (&#34;Even hate should be precise&#34;) to the reverent in the next (&#34;Whitsunday in Kirchstetten&#34;) make him one of those poets we cannot readily dispraise without convicting ourselves of envy.	2001-02-10

A necessary book is not necessarily a perfect book, but there is something here for everyone.<br />We detect a slight preference for the &quot;new&quot; -- and often the radical -- in prosody and in politics.  If we are looking for W H Auden in this book, we will not find him because he seems in the anthologist's opinion to have remained &quot;essentially British.&quot;  Auden disdained slang and anarchic versification, but I don't think that constitutes sufficient reason for declaring him un-American.<br />The oldest poet in this book is Robert Frost, born in 1874 (not 75, as the book claims); the youngest poet is Joel Sloman, born in 1943.  The titanic modernists of the early part of the century are well-represented:  Pound, Eliot, Stevens, Williams, Moore.  And Carruth is unfailingly generous to the lesser figures:  Aiken, Van Doren, Yvor Winters, MacLeish, Louise Bogan.<br />This anthology excels in presenting poets born between 1899 (Allen Tate, Hart Crane) and 1929 (Adrienne Rich).  We could list the figures, familiar and not-so-familiar:  Lowell, Berryman, Roethke, Duncan, Elizabeth Bishop, Charles Olson, Countee Cullen, Robert Hayden, Thomas Merton, Richard Wilbur, Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, Denise Levertov, Robert Bly.<br />Donald Hall is not included, perhaps because he had not yet written his very best work; Richard Howard is not included, presumably because he wasn't a beatnik.  James Merrill and John Ashbery are here, as is Hayden Carruth in an admirably modest selection prefaced by an endearingly humble biographical note.<br />When it comes to poets born after 1930, the anthology  is at its least satisfying.  There are Sylvia Plath and Wendell Berry, Gary Synder and Gregory Corso, but few others that seem to justify Carruth's endorsement.  Robert Pinsky, Robert Hass, Louise Gluck, Charles Simic and Mark Strand are conspicuous by their absence; and of course, Seamus Heaney is Irish, and -- as we are often reminded in the preface -- this is an American anthology.<br />All in all, a capacious, generous, inclusive selection, sometimes culpably inclusive; one that should be read in conjunction with other anthologies, ones which contain the indisputably durable examples of the noble and demanding art of poetry.hat seem to justify Carruth's endorsement.

Written in a conversational tone (compared to his earlier work) and in a tenor of affable tough-mindedness, Fr Groeschel illustrates his theses about hell, about penitence, about God's grace, using many incidents and real-life stories from his own experience as a Franciscan Friar of the Renewal in the South Bronx, an area which police have denominated &quot;Fort Apache&quot; and which priests call &quot;Our Lady's Playground.&quot;<br />Unsentimental but never hectoring, clear-eyed and hopeful, acutely aware of the tragic and the sinful but nonetheless unwavering in faith, hope, and charity, Fr Groeschel has given us a book that you will read at least seven times a year.  There is a marvellously restorative effect to &quot;Healing the Original Wound,&quot; and without hesitation, this reviewer declares it to be the best of the friar's books.<br />It might be mentioned further that a book like this one reveals the crippling inadequacy of labels like &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative.&quot;  Benedict Groeschel is a Catholic priest who works among the poor in New York City, who has an ardent love of Catholic tradition, who doesn't take kindly to dissings of JP2, who reveres the memories of Archbishop Oscar Romero and Dom Helder Camara, and who on occasion has kind words to say about Mother Angelica.  We think it safe to say that he is uncategorizable and inimitable.  And we thank God for him, and this wonderfully magnanimous book of his.	2001-02-03

It is, as he notes in a foreword, not an unfamiliar story:  the venerable Cardinal Newman, and the late Msgr Ronald Knox among others have written nobly in this vein.  But please do read Thomas Howard who is, I would venture to say, the ablest writer of English prose alive in the world today.  We say this not merely for the Audenesque capacity of his vocabulary, the Scarlatti-like elegance of each paragraph, or the luminously well-reasoned arguments he advances in favour of the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church . . . but also (and most especially) for his good humour and his charity toward those in the Protestant world with whom he has parted company.<br />On the seventy-second page, Dr Howard describes his reception into the Ecclesia in an amusing, smile-inducing fashion; he is in the process of realizing that ethnic homogeneity (thank God!) is not one of the marks of the Catholic Church.  &quot;This is what the Kingdom of Heaven looks like.&quot;  No preferential option for the lettered, for the laurelled, for the European, for the successful.<br />It is the beauty of the Church Fathers, the &quot;next generation&quot; after the Apostles, that leads him more than anything into Catholicity.  Their writings -- those of Ignatius, Polycarp, Origen, et al. -- are described as &quot;titanic&quot; and &quot;luminous.&quot;  If they were in error, as the fundamentalists would claim, then their error was infinitely wiser than the truths that Howard had known.<br />But again, the story is familiar; please do read this book (in conjunction, perhaps with Howard's &quot;Evangelical is Not Enough&quot;) for the scintillant, effervescent, joyful, good-humoured prose -- the very endearing style in which the tale is told.	2001-01-29

The book details Runcie's education, his upbringing, his Anglo-Catholicism, and his attempts while at Canterbury to achieve a rapprochement with Rome. There is a section containing nine of Archbishop Runcie's more memorable sermons, on everything from the Resurrection to the Falklands conflict to the Queen Mum's birthday. Runcie's humour is evident from ample anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />This book is also a chronicle of Runcie's attempt to navigate between the shoals of tradition and modernism, with especial attention to the impending go-ahead to the ordination of women (which occurred officially only during the enthronement of Dr Runcie's successor at Lambeth, Archbishop Carey). While wary of some of the more extreme manifestations o!f modernism, Runcie can do little to stop the changes, and is deplored for it in scathing terms by a former student turned critic, Gareth Bennett.<br /><br />Hastings' tone is respectful toward his subject. His admiration for Dr Runcie is evident. However, the book is marred by seeming hastily put together, written in a breezy, occasionally sardonic tone, and blighted by several cantankerous and cranky references to the current Bishop of Rome, Pope John Paul II. Nonetheless, this reviewer, a non-Anglican eager to learn about one of Anglicanism's most prominent figures in the last quarter-century, found the biography to be, for the most part commendable. (Perhaps Jonathan Mantle's ampler biography, entitled \\"Archbishop,\\" could be read in conjunction with Hastings' informative, but perhaps not definitive, portrait.)	2001-01-28

The selection in this volume is generous:  at least 20 poems, with 10 poems selected for especial scrutiny and delved into by Bishop Robert Morneau, whose love for poetry and whose admiration for Jessica's work, is abundant and evident.<br /><br />The one disappointment in Morneau's critique is his use of Jessica's poem &#34;Leftovers,&#34; about the Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes, as an excuse to downplay the supernatural nature of this miracle.  The twelve baskets are &#34;merely symbols of God's extravagance and bounty.&#34;  Or perhaps the miracle is that Jesus encouraged otherwise uncharitable people to start sharing what they had.  The good bishop's treatment of this poem is a minor but significant infelicity.<br /><br />But our disappointment is momentary; we soon redirect our attention to the charm of Jessica's poetry -- holy without being pietistic, formal without being stiff, lyrical without being sappy.  It is fresh and alive.  And to be fair to Bishop Morneau, his love of poetry is contagious, and his comments for the most part apposite.<br /><br />We cannot neglect to mention the splendid artistry in the collages and other pictures of Joseph Karlik, nicely enhancing the poetry of this book without overwhelming it.  At times, Karlik's artistry is every bit as grace-filled as the bishop's charitably attentive interpretations.<br /><br />Addendum, December 2012: I recently reacquired this book after many years (it had gotten lost in the shuffle of moving to and fro over the last decade).  I am so very glad to have Jessica Powers, Bishop Morneau, and Joseph Karlik as companions during these days when the weather turns wintry!	2001-01-28

There is a homage to the artist Leonard Baskin, renowned as a maker of woodcuts.  A keen visual sense in these poems leads us not to be surprised when we learn that Plath worked well as a painter of watercolours.<br />Her second pre-posthumous volume, &quot;Ariel,&quot; is perhaps more famous for its unselfsparing chronicle of a crashing marriage and of suicidal depression.  Its fiercely unfettered cadences and controversial images attracted immediate attention, praise and opprobrium.  But this reviewer feels that the poems of &quot;Colossus&quot; represent the superior achievement, possessing a technique and a sonic command surpassed by precious few poets of our age.	2001-01-21

Nine of the poems are sonnets, all of the poems are in the nimble idiom that is so recongizably his own.<br />The small lyric &quot;yes is a pleasant country&quot; (14th of the eighteen poems) is as delicate and fine as anything by Robert Herrick.<br />The listener will finds herself memorizing these poems, perhaps without intending to.  Cummings' mellow, sharp, distinctive, and occasionally cranky voice gives him the slight edge over the unremittingly stentorian yet much beloved Dylan Thomas as the premier reader of poetry in the twentieth century.<br />To paraphrase Cummings himself: &quot;we thank you, estlin, for most these amazing songs.&quot;	2001-01-21

We see German captives being pleasantly surprised by the humane treatment of the American guards, who observed the letter and the spirit of the Geneva Convention, and we see the Americans learning that not all Germans were enthusiasts of Hitler's fanatical National Socialism -- far from it!  There are disputes about the 'pulpwood quota' (German prisoners in Stark assisted the locals in their efforts at paper production) which led to a five-day strike, but also led to deeper understanding about the dignity of the captive workers.  There are amusing tales of attempted escapes -- the most successful being that of a colourful character named Franz Bacher, a youthful Austrian artist who made it to New York City.  There is an illuminating glimpse into the generosity of the townspeople of Stark toward the prisoners of war, from an enemy nation but sharing a common humanity.  There are tales of collaboration at arduous tasks, and there is a record of the small acts of charity and levity which transfigured a potentially painful experience into the basis of camaderie and a future peace.<br />One need not be a historian, or an ardent reader of history to appreciate Allen Koop's handsomely written book; one need only be a human being, possessed of sufficient imagination to place oneself in the shoes of a stranger in a strange land.	2001-01-21

We need not agree with his every notion about matters political or sexual or literary, but it is the sour soul indeed who will not find this earthy confessional memoir to be gladdening; nay, uplifting.<br />The dire puns, the pranks, the lyrical reminiscence of an unrequitable love of his adolescence: as Fry reminds us about that last item, we've all been there.<br />It's not a book you'll find in a Camaldolese monastery (well, nowadays you never know), but the wit, the humour, the candid self-assessment, the grace of each paragraph ... well, if you don't believe me, go to a bookstore, open it at random, read five or six pages, and if your laughter is not so loud that you get sharp, stern looks from the other book-browsers, I'd be very surprised indeed.<br />Is Stephen Fry a role model?

It contains several brief, luminous, sound, quiet, humble essays and observations gleaned from the labours, prayers, and extensive reading of this century's most prominent and perhaps most mercurial Trappist monk.<br />The tone is sedate.  It is loyal to the ecclesia, and contains the unmistakable Merton note:  the apologia for solitude as the mother of contemplation, prayer, wisdom, and holy hope.  Confident without being preachy, serene without being quietistic or dull, not at all contaminated with the ephemera of politics or with complaints against the rigours of his chosen life, THOUGHTS IN SOLITUDE is an excellent place for the new Merton explorer to begin, and a very good place for the veteran spiritual reader to return from time to time:  each essay (or prayer) scarcely more than a few paragraphs, sometimes only one paragraph, is a kind of haven from the tumult of the world that can be frequently &quot;too much with us.&quot;<br />Merton cautions against, and is wise to caution against, a misanthropy or a cowardice that calls itself religious solitude, because we can come to know, and do come to know God through our neighbours, as uncomely and annoying as some of them are at times (my words, not Merton's)!<br />He relates humility to listening, relates reading to prayer, and relates all things to God.  The temptation to quote is overwhelming, but we will leave it to the readers to select their favourite passages.  (Section X of part two is a lovely prayer, indeed.)<br />There are more than a few uncritical readers of Merton, &quot;Mertonolaters&quot; if you will, who praise his writing and his thinking in a fashion that would perhaps embarrass the monk himself.  But this fine book, written before the many distractions of his later years, truly does merit the generous praise that it has received here and elsewhere.  Is it the work of &quot;a joyful Christian&quot;?  Joy, as we think of it, is maybe not the salient note; but rather, peace, freedom from confusion, and the true desire to love God on the part of an often restless spirit.

It traces the genesis of Cummings as poet and as man.  It gives us his opinion (at which sophomores might marvel) that no one should venture free verse until he has MASTERED the sonnet, rondeau, ballade, etc.  It gives us a syllabus of poems that he loved in his youth and continued to love in his adulthood:  Dante, Swinburne, Shakespeare's 116th sonnet, Charles d'Orleans, Walther von der Vogelweide, Shelley, Keats.  There are words of praise for Dante Gabriel Rossetti's sonnets.  There are ten of E E Cummings' sonnets included in these lectures (but my copy of &quot;i&quot; contains three significant typographical howlers).<br />We see the libertarian Cummings, the man who &quot;values freedom&quot; and abominates &quot;the subhuman superstate USSR.&quot;  We see his almost impenetrable parody of Communism in a snippet of his book EIMI, about a trip to Leninist Moscow.  We see bits of the play &quot;Santa Claus,&quot; his gleeful proverbs called &quot;jottings,&quot; and a few paragraphs in defense of Ezra Pound.<br />We have in the six nonlectures the heart of a man in love with life and spring and joy and birth and (yes of course) love.  &quot;To feel something is to be alive.&quot;  And woe betide the reader who feels nothing when she or he reads these marvellous pages.	2000-12-11

This book remains a favourite of ours, fifteen years after its purchase.<br /><br />The Glanmore Sonnets occupy a central position in this slender but rich volume, as is fitting; it is perhaps Heaney's masterwork. The Elegy to Robert Lowell, the \\"welder of English\\" who composed \\"heart-hammering blank sonnets of love for Harriet and Lizzie\\" is also noteworthy.<br /><br />There is much about the sectarian warfare of the troubled six counties of Northern Ireland, but like Dante (who appears via epigraph and translation in this book) Heane!y can transfigure the sins of his land into glorious language that is an exemplar of poetry's redemptive potentiality. \\"I think our very form is bound to change ... Unless forgiveness finds its nerve and voice.\\"<br /><br />There is much here about love, nuptial, natural, sexual. At the end of \\"The Guttural Muse,\\" there is a couplet of exclusion from the joyful earthiness that the poet observes: \\"I felt like some old pike all badged with sores / Wanting to swim in touch with soft-mouthed life.\\"<br /><br />There is warfare and loss, violence and bliss, the joys of the flesh and the crucifixion of a country. But after reading the poems in FIELD WORK, the reader will doubtless share in Seamus Heaney's faith that \\"the end of art is peace.\\"	2000-12-10

The poems are more formal than those found in &quot;Ariel&quot; and other posthumous books; but &quot;The Colossus&quot; does manage to remain quite vivid in the memory as a formidable achievement by a truly skilled poet, with a painterly eye, and an ear as good as any other midcentury poet.	2000-11-20

The decency, compassion, humour, whimsicality, love of family, love of country, and ultra-endearing self-deprecation of George Herbert Walker Bush make this book a very gladdening read, indeed.<br />We miss the 41st President, and wish him well.<br />Addenda : Especial favorites among these epistles include his gracious, measured, moderate letter to Cardinal Law at the outbreak of hostilities during the Gulf War; a letter to a relative poking blunt fun at himself over his, uhm, somewhat inglorious dinner with the Japanese Prime Minister; and a letter where he recalls a lunch at his uncle's gentlemen's club, and a curious tidbit about one of the member's peculiar showering habits ...<br />Bush 41 shows himself to be so beautifully down-to-earth and wonderfully human in these letters, that it reinforces this reviewer's regret over never having given him a vote.

Unquestionably, this is Lewis's finest book:  his warmest, his calmest, his most pellucid writing.  Cheerful meditations on liturgical reform, petitionary prayer, the Eucharist, purgatory, and Joy (&quot;the serious business of Heaven&quot;).  A book to be cherished, a book to be taken to heart.<br />Even persons who are disinclined to venerate C S Lewis will be won over, I imagine, by this slender -- but infinitely magnanimous and supremely luminous -- offering. &quot;One of the purposes for which God instituted prayer may have been to bear witness that the course of events is not governed like a state, but created like a work of art to which every being makes its contribution.&quot;  This book on prayer is a work of art, salvific and salutary.

We need not be ardent admirers of Francis Thompson to sympathize with the plight of this very modern figure, torn between addiction to laudanum and love of the Transcendent.<br />Waldron's book sets out to do four things: (a) Provide biographical information about the poet; (b) Introduce us to his most famous poem; (c) Explicate the text, open it up, provide comparisons to other works of literature, devotional and poetic; (d) Demonstrate how most good poetry can be used as material for prayer -- the striking and famous example to which Waldron alludes is Simone Weil's &quot;lectio divina&quot; with George Herbert's &quot;Love bade me welcome, yet my soul drew back.&quot;<br />Waldron turns an indulgent eye to the aesthetic flaws of &quot;The Hound of Heaven&quot;:  among them, the archaisms, accented ed's, and overuse of syntactical inversion -- poets in Wordsworth's day would have been impatient with some of Thompson's prosodical traits!  And some of the comparisons are adventurous.  But we certainly cannot find fault with Waldron's thorough knowledge of his subject, and the evident joy with which he writes.  &quot;The Hound&quot; is a grand metaphor which has inspired artists, writers, and inquirers into the mysteries of the Catholic faith; Waldron cites Dorothy Day, Eugene O'Neill, and the painter Ives Gammell.  We might be surprised to learn that Oscar Wilde (see p. 48) had very generous things to say about Thompson's masterwork -- a surprise that is lessened when we consider the temperament of Wilde as poet in works such as &quot;E Tenebris.&quot;<br />Waldron's book is teacherly without being disaffectingly didactic; it is informative and genial; it is an unhesitant apologia for poetry as a force for good, as a genitrix of hope, in even the most troubled of lives.<br />A proofreading note!  In the sonnet found on pp 30-31 (section entitled &quot;A Woman's Pity&quot;), the sixth line is missing.  &quot;That to my deathless progeny of pain / You should be mother,&quot; etc.oman's Pity&quot;), the sixth line is missing.  &quot;That to my deathless progeny of pain / You should be mother,&quot; etc.	2000-10-31

Groeschel is the nation's pre-eminent Franciscan.  Author and TV personality, he is perhaps the most genial apologist for Roman Catholicism since the days of Archbishop Sheen.  In THE JOURNEY TOWARD GOD, Fr Groeschel has put together an anthology of spiritual writing that he values.  Insouciant about the ecclesial membership of the authors, Fr Benedict has given us a mixture of Roman Catholic neo-Scholasticism, a few writings from the Saints, a surprisingly large amount of Protestant sources, and a shockingly small selection from the treasures of Eastern Orthodoxy (the book's subtitle implies a generosity of representation that simply is not there).<br />A significant vexation is the absence of an index, needed so that readers might more readily find those passages they value most.  The book's primary problem, however, is that there are few selections in it that set our hearts ablaze, truly, precious few that we wish to read more than once.  Mostly, Fr Groeschel seems concerned with keeping to his scheme of describing the various stages of religious conversion, and finding selections that fit his categories.  He seems less concerned with finding selections that &quot;grab&quot; the reader by the heart or soul and keep the reader enraptured.  Most of the selections can be aptly abridged to read, &quot;Be good and pray often.&quot;  A noble admonition. But to get to that message, we are made to endure a disaffecting prolixity.<br />What we miss most of all when we peruse THE JOURNEY TOWARD GOD is the sound of Fr Groeschel's amiable, tough, intelligent, wry, humorous, charitable voice.  For this, we must put aside his anthology, and turn to his other books.	2000-10-28

The book begins by telling us how poetry can be read as prayer, as &quot;secular psalms&quot; if you will, and provides some valuable quotations about the connection between art and religious meditation, from Simone Weil and Pope John Paul, among others.  There is a brief biographical chapter on Thomas Merton, as well as a survey of some of his more notable prose works.  (We are especially grateful for the excerpt describing Merton's &quot;Louisville Epiphany.&quot;)<br />  But the book is devoted to the poetry of Thomas Merton, and three poems are selected for extended exegesis:  &quot;Elias,&quot; &quot;Night-Flowering Cactus,&quot; and &quot;Stranger.&quot;  These poems are from a kind of middle period in Merton's verse-work, after the early declamatory hymns of devotional imagery and stentorian phrasing, and prior to the jolly anarchy of &quot;Cables to the Ace.&quot;  These middle poems are especially well-chosen, spare without being stark, musical without being flowery.<br />  Waldron's patient stanza-by-stanza interpretation teaches us much, and convinces us that &quot;Elias&quot; is a great achievement, unfairly overlooked.  (The reader is even invited into the red trailer where Merton composed the poem!) &quot;Night-Flowering Cactus&quot; must be read aloud, slowly and reverently; it is perhaps the poem in the book worthiest of comparison to a scriptural psalm.  &quot;Stranger&quot; is a quietly luminous verbal icon, seeming to rhyme without actually doing so, with softly secure lines of a Blake-like or Roethkean simplicity.<br />  The book ends with suggestions on how best to read poetry in a prayerful fashion, and with an ample syllabus of poems by a variety of authors whose words instill the serenity (and sometimes the tumult) of religious contemplation.  With boldly natural artwork by Helen Kita, a laudatory introduction by Sister Macrina Wiederkehr, and deeply respectful -- if not reverent -- exploration by Robert Waldron into Merton's verse, this book is perhaps the best in the &quot;Poetry as Prayer&quot; series.

God is explored under the various aspects of Mystery, Trinity, Creator, Man, Spirit, Prayer, and Eternity.  Voices are summoned from the distant past and from the immediate present, from West and East; a truly &quot;catholic&quot; book,  an inspiration, yes; but more, a re-vivification for those sensibilities that might be slumbering under the deadness of custom.  &quot;Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light&quot; (Ephesians 5.14).<br />  Bishop Kallistos gives us an Orthodoxy that is receptive to other traditions, but mutely and benignly aware of its own excellence.  He gives us a picture of the Invisible God, Who is the Source and Summit of all love, beauty, mercy, goodness, purity and truth. This is not the offering of a modish &quot;personality&quot; here to give us an absolution from every challenge, nor is it the hectoring of some reactionary suspicious of every vicissitude; no, this is a book of light and of life.<br />We cannot think of a reason why any reader would not be grateful for the incalculably precious blessing that is THE ORTHODOX WAY.	2000-10-26
