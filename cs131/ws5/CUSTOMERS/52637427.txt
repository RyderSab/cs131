Beyond presenting a safe means of expressing emotions with art, this book helps children (an all of us) cope with negative feelings and delight in positive ones. <br /> <br />Each interactive art lesson has 4 steps. <br /> <br />1. Before you begin: a list of supplies, definitions, and references for further exploration.  <br /> <br />2. A verbal and visual representation of the emotion, e. g. the word, lonely, printed on a color often associated with the feeling plus a suggestion of one coping device. <br /> <br />3. A pictorial representation expressing the emotion. <br /> <br />4. A narrative for caregivers and step-by-step instructions for artistic expression. <br /> <br />Fold-out diary flaps for recording feelings before and after the lessons are at the front and back of the book. <br /> <br />This book is attractive, helpful, and practical.	2005-02-10

I really felt like I was visiting my home state of SC with the descriptions of the tabby ruins, scenes in Charleston, the marshes, the low country boil, etc. She even includes a recipe for a low country boil. It is a popular seafood treat. <br />  <br />The peaceful atmosphere and caring people in the small coastal SC town of Tabby Walk are a welcome change as Rachel leaves Chicago to vacation at her grandparent's beach house. To her surprise, she meets a man who is visiting from Atlanta to enjoy childhood memories of the small town. Although the vacation is short, they continue to see each other and fall in love. <br /> <br />Rachel and Austin share Christian values. They reach out to others. One touching development is finding love letters written during the War between the States and their thoughtful efforts to locate the descendants. The author uses historically accurate details. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the relaxed nature of the book. I prefer stories which don't scare me to death. If I want that, I can watch network news! <br />	2004-12-04

This trait helps a young girl deal with her feelings of guilt about her grandfather's alzheimer's disease. As children often do, she thinks  he doesn't want to remember her because of something terrible she did or said. There is a powerful message for parents to realize the possibility of this reaction in children. Talking about it helps. <br /> <br />The child's tendency to live in the present and her grandfather's life without memories from the past, ends the book with a hopeful note as the two relate to each other on a new level. <br /> <br />An added benefit is that the book has English and Spanish on each page. It also has a glossary to help readers of both languages.  <br />	2004-08-01

Reviewers who call it biased probably didn't even read it enough to realize that it doesn't even blame Clinton for the first attack on the World Trade Center and the USS Cole attack during his 8 years. It also doesn't blame Bush for his 8 months. By the way, there are reports that they planned to attack in May but were delayed. Make that 5 months for Bush.    Some people don't recognize the truth when they see it. They are like the man who said: Don't confuse me with the facts. I've got my mind made up!          The report even says that the media let us down in NOT calling our attention to a threat which has been brewing for a long time.

Everyone talks about strategies. The author is doing that also and doing it in a hopeful way. I hate the term, attention deficit. Most people are too quick to feel that a student can't develop self-control. If a person thinks they can't control themselves, they can't. One of the psychiatrists in the mental health center where I work said that the largest handicap is often a patient's perception of the diagnosis.<br />There are several children's books that help children develop strategies for self-control and a hopeful attitude. One is a new book titled, Whoa Wiggle-worm. One of the characters is named Lickety-split. Cool and uncool nicknames is one of the things they deal with in the book. Self-control is shown on a level that children can relate to.	2004-05-28

A spectacular panoramic view of breathtaking waves of imagination, will give you memories to last a lifetime.<br />In this poetic story a young girl experiences some of that feeling during her outing at the beach. Having missed the first wave, is dunked by the second one, and then finally catches the third.<br />While on her floater, from the white caps of the roaring sea waves arise 10,000 White Horses, some unique guest members of the aquatic world. Running along the waves, pushing and shoving, as they playfully race for the shore. For one heart pounding moment upon reaching the sandy beach they jump through darkness and disintegrate back into the sea.<br />10,000 White Horses is a great adventure and a way to introduce young children to the wonders of nature, gaining a deep appreciation for these cosmically remarkable creatures.<br />This is an excellent starter book for both English and Spanish speaking children and an instrumental teaching tool for teachers and parents.	2004-05-05

This is a great book anyway because the child uses his \\"problem of paying too close attention to minute details\\" to find his way out of the woods in order to rescue his dad. He is the hero and not a problem child as such. We learn some about his problems and some solutions but this well written story puts us in his shoes in a very understanding and kind way. This reminds me of a new book, Whoa Wiggle-worm by Betsy B. Lee. It discusses kind and unkind nicknames in an entertaining story showing a child learning self-control. A diagnosis is not given. The child might not be ADD or ADHD. The label is beside the point. I hope both books are in print for a very long time.	2004-05-03

What child can't identify with the frustrations of not being able to accomplish what someone else accomplishes? Many children generalize and say they can't do anything right when they met with failures. This book is encouraging for any child, regular or special education. Another book to use with this one is Little Lemon - Activities for Developing Motivation and Memory Skills by Betsy B. Lee. It has a story, song, discussion questions, and lessons to help develop learning strategies by giving specific techniques. Leo, the Late Bloomer does not give this kind of instruction but it is very encouraging and a big help.	2004-05-01

Lee's book, a little girl plays at the shore, imagining that 10,000 WHITE HORSES take her up and over the roaring waves. She giggles as they race up her back, nagging her to play. The girl tries to float on the white horses and doesn't give up as her mother lovingly watches from the shore.<BR>Lee's book teaches children to try, try again using rhyming, playful text. Catharine E. Varnedoe, from Savannah, Georgia, sketched the charming illustrations that add a visual flair to the wonderfully written children's storybook.<br />10,000 WHITE HORSES would make a wonderful addition to any library, classroom, or day care center, and comes highly recommended by this reviewer.	2004-04-29

The tree gives and gives till it is nothing but a stump. The boy (later the man when he grows up) uses and uses with no thought of the tree's needs, its feelings, or the tree's life. It is interesting that the user is male and the one being taken unfair advangage of is female. In this day of political correctness, it is a wonder that people like this book. Why didn't the author make the user female and the victim male? I bet it would have not been as popular this way. I find it offensive. We are teaching girls to let people use them and teaching boys to have no concern about hurting someone: chopping them down bit by bit as is done in this book. Some people actually use this book in classrooms. We need to be aware that this is not just teaching about giving. It is teaching about let people abuse you. The tree even likes being used this way even when she is just a stump instead of the beautiful tree of her younger days.	2004-04-22

I was on a first name basis with some of them. (The friendly status was intiated by them.) I was almost there but not quite! I sold magazine articles but I wanted to sell books! I quit writing and returned to a full time job as a school psychologist. After a few years, my school sent me to a national convention where I met educators who were selling their self-published books. Before I left the convention, I knew I would self-publish but I didn't know how.<br />Dan's books have been the fulfillment of a dream! I would have made so many mistakes and wasted so much money if I hadn't followed his suggestions. I have only been self-publishing for a few years but I have retired from the school system and I am devoting my time to my first love. I'm too old to keep waiting on the whims of big book publishers. I've published several of my own children's books now and two children's books which were written by a visually impaired friend. The name of my website is Learning Abilities Books. I've also published a book for adults which has been used in many writing classes: A Basic Guide to Writing, Selling, and Promoting Children's Books plus Information about Self-publishing (by Betsy B. Lee). The book is basic and it has many resources. It allows time for students to present their own stories in class.	2004-03-01

Another book that does that is Whoa Wiggle-worm which addresses name calling (by adults and children), helping others, understanding and self-conrol.	2004-03-01

I had severe problems at home but these books were an escape from bad thoughts. Today, I think we spend too much time reminding children of how terrible things are instead of giving them a look at hopeful, happy situations. Some problem books are good and I wish there had been more of that when I was a child. I'm just saying we overdo the bad stuff.<br />Another good thing about these books is teaching sight words. Phonics are important but so are sight words. For modern happy stories with sight words, use Betsy Lee's Dolch sight word books such as Albert, the Apple Eating Appaloosa.<br />I also recommend books by MisterRogers (Fred Rogers) and his TV show.	2004-02-19

This is one of the best books I've read to help the self-esteem of children with Add or LD or any other kind of learning problem.<BR>It doesn't dumb down the criteria. It shows the child being the hero of the story using some of his natural abilities. It also shows some of the techniques he develops for learning. It is a wonderful story for any child with or without a disability.	2002-01-02

Rate It&quot; and I clicked on &quot;five stars.&quot; Then I was referred to other books I might like based on my rating. They referred me to books about writing for children! NO. This book is not about the ABC's. It is about scapegoating. Glasser is a psychologist who works a lot on helping people (children and adults) learn to take responsibility for personal behavior. Children and adults need to break free of the &quot;blame game.&quot; This is an insightful little book. I highly recommend it.	2001-03-17

Look up books using the keyword, shyness. Here are some I found at amazon.com<br />Buster: The Very Shy Dog by Lisze Bechtold(Illustrator) <br />Let's Talk About Being Shy (The Let's Talk Library) by Marianne Johnston <br />J. Rooker, Manatee by Jan Haley, Paul Brent(Illustrator) <br />The Shy Child : A Parent's Guide to Preventing and Overcoming Shyness from Infancy to Adulthood by Philip G. Zimbardo, Shirley L. Radl <br />These can be helpful. The book I'm reviewing IS more HARMFUL than helpful. I didn't order it. I read it at a library. It is awful and would increase feelings of inadequacy, anger, etc. which can make a person shy.<br />School, insurance programs, medical programs, and so forth make a lot of money by having kids diagnosed so they can get money from the government. Remember, &quot;the government&quot; is our tax dollars and many of these dollars are spent unwisely!<br />Buy some of the other great books at amazon.com about shyness but don't get this one!	2001-01-10

I'm surprised that this book doesn't have dozens of reviews about it's value. This book is full of practical suggestions for helping children in all grades learn to do better in school.<br />It has info about the teacher's role, developmental concerns, training strategies, etc. broken down for what works best at different grade levels. One of my favorite parts is about how to teach study skills effectively. Quite often it is not taught well.<br />This is really a great find. I highly recommend it. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.	2001-01-08

It reflects family values of love, trust, faith (including religious faith) and it also shows girls a role model of sensitivity, caring, and true female strength. In these days of Barbie dolls and warrior princeses, girls need this  experience with a young woman who has realistic strength and love.	2000-04-06

My dad was born in 1899 and he often spoke of treating horses and children also with horse sense. He would have loved seeing this book with so much &quot;horse sense.&quot; Too bad we don't use more of these gentle  techniques, teaming up, etc. with our own children. Some kids are pretty  wild too. I recommend reading this and seeing how we can apply some of the  techniques to people. How to win friends and influence horses and children!	1999-11-02

My book is doing well with the help of Kremer's book, newsletter, and website. I've met some self-publishers who felt like their wonderful book had turned sour because  of poor sales. I recommended this book to revive their sales. (Betsy B.  Lee, author of a  children's motivational book using the concept of making  lemonade when life hands you a lemon.

All of us have bad things happen to us and tend to blame others for our choices if we get into trouble. Some people always blame others. Boulden has created a very realistic story but he focuses on helping kids make  responsible choices and learn from their mistakes rather than going through  life blaming others which is an attitude often found in people who are  constantly in trouble. It is a great book and it is written for kids that  are young enough to be more likely to respond in a positive way.	1999-10-04

We couldn't find any books about writing when we  phoned &quot;Talking Books for the Blind.&quot; She really enjoys this  book.	1999-02-04
