In this book, we have an extended blurb on each of the 21 chefs and the equivalent of a tasting menu of food recipes...including dessert. <br /> <br />The problem is common to these glossy, large-format tomes...the food stylist that did the plates for the photographer often took extreme liberties with the recipes. This leaves you with the choice of cooking what's in the photo if you can decode it visually and have the chops, or cooking what's in the recipe and feeling inept to match the glossy. <br /> <br />This becomes glaringly obvious by the time you get to the 2nd recipe of the book, \\"Catfish Pecan with Lemon-Thyme-Pecan Butter.\\" In the photo, the catfish is lying on a plate coated with a lemon beurre blanc. The recipe, on the other hand, creates a beurre noir...it's sort of a Nawlins-riff on skate with black butter, heated up with cayenne, sweetened with pecans, and fattened with catfish. I might suggest that the recipe is better than the photo's idea even though it is not particularly picturesque...indeed quite down & dirty and earty looking. Oh well. <br /> <br />They take the poblanos out of the sweet potato soup to make it more yellow. They add corn to the succotash (one wonders why the recipe left it out?) and they put grits and parsnips on the plate with the pecan-crusted rabbit (taking the cream out of the gravy as well)...all sensible choices for your closeup, but still...WYSIWYG, right? <br /> <br />Anyway, the food standard in this one turns out to be tasty but not of the three Michelin star \\"worth a journey\\" level you might hope for...nothing I've tried has wriggled into my repetoire yet, but the competition for that is utterly fierce. Still, the book introduces me to lots of new things, even if it ends up teaching me more about photography.	2005-09-28

If Raichlen did write this, could someone tell me who wrote the BBQ bible?<br />One hopes we can blame this on the ghost writers, who are competing with Taste of Home for the kind of crude home cooking some people actually struggle through.  I don't even think a self-respecting cheeto-chewin Oprah watcher would find any value in this mess of a book.<br />It had the gross misfortune of coming out just before its high-carb, high-calorie \\"healthy\\" food was declared null and void by the Atkins crowd, and it thus falls into a canyon of uselessness.  It doesn't have the flavor and profundity of the BBQ Bible yet it isn't worth the sacrifice on any other dimension.<br />The usual cardinal sins are committed, including extremely heavily styled food...to the point of making you feel inept or squint at the recipe for what it left out between what's on your plate and what's pictured glossily.<br />A bargain is a bargain and they are trying to burn these for firewood at this point I'm sure.	2004-04-11

Bible: Over 500 Recipes	Books	5	3	7	N	N	Grilling repetoire	If a cookbook can squeeze more than one recipe into my repetoire, it gets an automatic 5 stars.  This book passes muster.<br />I think this is probably the only Raichlen work worth studying.  Although the How to Grill book I would get instead for those who don't know how to tie their shoes culinarily.<br />He gets these recipes from people all over the world and many of them are outstanding.  He must be very personable to coax them out of all those talents.  I don't think he is a particularly great cook but he does know enough about grilling.<br />I think this will please gourmands who want to be able to extend their abilities to the summer get-together concept, but it will be a bit over the head of your average beergutted grill jockey.  Most of my nascent grilling repetoire so far consists of variations on what I found within.	2004-04-11

The lack of reviews here doesn't surprise me; more surprising will be if my review actually survives the intense lobbying effort The Conspiracy will make to remove this.  In fact, they would already have removed the book entirely but for the possibility that might arouse attention.<br />You see, without a shadow of a doubt, Yeo mistakenly published the recipes intended for her staff in this book.  The recipes that were intended for mass consumption had already been made indicipherable, with unobtainable ingredients, opaque prose, misleading illustrations and the like, consistent with all cookbooks approved for public use by The Conspiracy.<br />Yet we have irrefutable evidence here that the Rules were not obeyed; these recipes are very easy to follow, clearly and accurately illustrated, with lots of ingredient substitutions clearly explained.  In fact an ordinary cook can produce delicious, tasty restaurant meals with little trouble from this work!  <br />The threat the escape of such information poses to The Conspiracy is manifest: people could realize how easy it is to cook at home without sacrificing quality at all, indeed, often improving quality.  This would undermine the very fabric of the restaurant industry, based on maintaining widespread culinary ignorance at all costs.<br />I imagine the book will be unceremoniously removed from print at some pre-determined date, and all extant copies immediately destroyed.  However, those lucky enough to obtain a copy now will have their eyes and palettes opened, and should consider hiding any copy they do have in a safe, undisclosed location.  Produce these delectable meals only for trusted confidants!	2004-01-15

You simply must buy this book and cook through it because every other author on the subject has done the same and cowers in the shadow of this achievement.	2004-01-15

Since this doesn't have a consistent narrative but is instead broken up into numerous tiny essays, it will be harder to get the maximum benefit from his approach to personal productivity from this alone.<br />Readers who \\"got\\" Getting Things Done don't need my advice on this one...they've already bought it I'm sure.<br />David Allen is probably the smartest personal productivity coach in print.  I would buy Getting Things Done for every employee in my organization, and I would have copies of this one lying around to remind people and elaborate on some of the finer points.<br />Oh and I would like to add one point.  I believe there is one thing missing from Mr. Allen's algorithm.  That is finishing.  I think his plan is outstanding for getting unstuck: figure out the next action, and do it without hesitation.  But I don't find any attention paid to how to decide how many actions are \\"enough\\" for a desired outcome of a project.  <br />You can always find some next action, and founder in what software engineers like myself call \\"permanent beta\\" or \\"feature creep.\\"  Yet external constraints are best not relied on exclusively for these decisions.  It's best to volunteer a ruthless focus on the essence of your project's deliverable, isn't it?<br />So I would like Mr. Allen to write his next book about finishing projects, if he is able to develop insights into that stage as strong as his insights into the process of the middle stages.	2004-01-04

Self-consistency, one imagines, is essential to &quot;making sense.&quot;<br />For instance, he waxes eloquent in his novelistic style about how critical maintaining the cork was to the evolution of the bottle shape: &quot;...there couldn't have been much laying down or cellaring of wines, at least to judge from the shape of the bottle...The bulbous base of the Globe and Spike made laying it sideways quite difficult and the long neck made it that much harder for the wine to neslte against a cork, keeping it moist and swollen, the seal intact.&quot; (p128) <br />This is followed soon after by: &quot;There is even serious doubt as to whether it is necessary to lay the bottles on their sides to keep the cork moist...I can attest from personal experience that the corks and the wines appear no different from old wines stored horizontally.&quot; (along with further arguments and examples, p139)<br />So if we bought the book hoping to &quot;make sense&quot; of all this, should we infer that laying bottles on their side is better or not?<br />The author, who doesn't include a single illustration save one of himself, appears to be on a search for &quot;truth in wine,&quot; which he argues in his first chapter is in fact reachable in the form of &quot;standards.&quot;  He then proceeds to demonstrate how such standards are indeed beyond the reach of objective truth in practice.<br />Nonsense.<br />However, I think everyone truly interested in wine should read this, if only to deepen the delicious enigma.	2004-01-01

For example, he argues that it is creative frustration that is basically the root of all that ails society.  To someone who suffers from it primarily, I guess it can look that way, and may even in fact be that way.  <br />I'm not certain everything in the book is correct or the best approach to looking at the problem.  But I think people struggling with these issues should read it thoroughly and decide for themselves.  <br />In some ways a more masculine approach that Goldberg's Writing Down the Bones or Cameron's The Artist's Way, Pressfield anthrpomorphises artist's block as &quot;Resistance&quot;, an enemy to be fought and defeated daily.  Seems exhausting, and it probably is.<br />I'm currently looking around for really effective solutions to this issue.  Most advice comes down to &quot;just do it&quot; but this book provides an interesting framework to think about the problem.<br />I would very much enjoy living in a world where the problem of creative block was solved comprehensively.	2003-07-05

For instance, Basco's book &quot;Never Good Enough&quot; on perfectionism.  Unfortunately, this isn't that. <br />In the interests of motivating and directing improvement, I will don the critic's cap.<br />The book begins with an effective practice, which is reframing expectations as &quot;wonder&quot;.  So instead of obsessing over hopes and fears, adopt a sense of &quot;wondering&quot; what will happen.  Rewrite your messages to yourself from &quot;I hope things work out like so&quot; to &quot;I wonder how things will work out.&quot;  <br />One wonders, indeed, how the passivity from this verbal tranquilizer would play out across society, with people not whipping themselves into improvement.  Obviously there would be plenty of happier more peaceful people, but perhaps all would wonder when the trains would arrive, if ever.<br />With that auspicious start one wonders through the rest of the book if anything else of applicability will be presented, but it devolves into a slightly new-age, feel-good fluff fest with a somewhat feminine targeting.  The only scraps worth keeping come from a handful of recycled quotes of others, like Feynman's satisfaction with ignorance, Ziglar's postulate that &quot;every obnoxious act is a cry for help,&quot; and a poet's observation that we enjoy games because they &quot;make things hard for the fun of it.&quot;	2003-07-02

It, at long last, taught me how to properly cook mushrooms, and for that I am obligated to give it five stars.<br />Now with that formality out of the way, I am free to tee off on this thing.  I just made the roast duck with root vegetables and apples recipe, and it was a honking example of awful kitchen testing.<br />The root vegetable quantities called for are probably in the region of twice as much as you need, but when they say \\"four turnips,\\" just how big a turnip are we talking?  Furthermore, the stuff should really be cut up into bite-sizes, but I guess he prefers to leave that up to the eater.  The results on first try are edible, but so autmumal that I forbid this to be served outside of New England in a month that ends with \\"r\\"--a prohibition only hinted at in the text.<br />The worst thing is the truth in advertising problem.  The food stylist who took the pictures of the preparations took liberties with the recipes!!!  Shock and horror!...The illustration for this particular recipe features ingredients not present in it (what's that leaf doing there...or the thyme?) and leaves out ingredients that should be there, and doesn't cross-hatch the duck skin, etc. etc. etc...<br />It makes you feel unable when you just can't match the illustration no matter what you do.  But these illustrations might not taste better than what the recipe says.<br />If the book really taught you to think like a chef, it would leave no question \\"why?\\" unanswered.  As it stands, this title is mostly unfulfilled...the book should be three or four times as long and explain every decision in every recipe and then it would teach you to think like a chef.<br />As it stands, thanks for the mushroom recipe Mr. Colicchio, and enjoy the five stars.	2003-05-05

This is without question one of the best cookbooks ever. I can't get my mind around how it is absolutely \\"just right\\". The food is lavish and beautifully presented, yet, it has this simplicity about it that brings it back from pomposity. There is a touch, a feel, that is as good as I've ever witnessed. A certain maturity that exudes extreme confidence.<br />Stylistically, the closest thing to this in my collection is the new edition of Larousse Gastronomique. Yet that book is full of recipes that are sloppily either over-the-top or ho-hum. Imagine that kind of cuisine taken to its absolute apex. <br />The descriptions are utterly clear, and detailed, and in a very helpful format of preperation, finishing touches, and presentation. This takes you through the mise en place carefully and then shows you what you need to do when ready to fire the plate and put it together. A quantum leap, IMO, in recipe presentation.<br />The photos are breathtaking. If you are intimidated by the recipes, you can always make yourself happy just viewing this as a picture book. But if you force yourself through these recipes a few times, you will lose the intimidation and wonder why you weren't cooking this way all along? Go ahead dive in the deep end...even a sloppy, crude rendition of these recipes will be worth every ounce of unnecessary stress.<br />I think Girardet has created a new watermark in cookbooks and look forward to seeing attempts to top this.<br />PS  Serious sleuthing has revealed what \\"Nion\\" is (for the Nion Tart).  Nion is the compressed nutmeat left over from creating nut oil.  Girardet calls for grating walnut or hazelnut nion for his tart.  It will take significantly more sleuthing to get one's hands on some nion, however!!! <br />Of course, no gourmet cookbook would be complete without calling for a tablespoon or two of pure unobtainium.	2002-09-30

It is so so true that she goes much further than the recipes and describes the how's and why's of what she is doing. Her writing has confirmed many of my own experiences I never found described elsewhere and has also taught me completely new twists on such fundamentals as making stock and dicing onions.<br />This is the woman who accidentally ended up living with the Troisgros brothers in France as a teenager and then ended up being the lunch chef at Chez Panisse instead of going to grad school. She was also a Stanford student. So you have genius and an unmatchable pedigree for California cuisine. That recipe cooks up a stellar cookbook...the surprise would be if it didn't.<br />Every preparation is paired with a specific wine and there is a fairly extensive section on cheese pairings. I mean, she's actually sharing the details here...including the crown jewel recipes of her franchise.<br />Although I live only two miles away I have never found occasion to go to her restaurant though I've always wanted to.

However, pushing it, and being forced to throw out some stuff, I have come up with the following safety guidelines so far.  <br />I believe Ms. Rodgers is working with extremely fresh product in ideal circumstances, which most of us aren't able to duplicate in our supermarkets.  Therefore her practices which she might find safe will not always be safe for us.  While salt does act as a preservative for meat, in the smallquantities used here (e.g. 3/4 tsp per pound) it's not enough to extend the life of the meat particularly long.  <br />My rules of thumb for the most time you can salt, refrigerated (and after rinsing poultry and seafood thoroughly), the best consumer meat in San Francisco follow.  If I was shopping at an average place, I wouldn't risk any delay in cooking at all.<br />Beef, Pork: 48 hours<BR>Poultry, lamb: 24 hours<BR>Seafood: 6 hours tops, less better<br />Note these probably aren't much different than you would have done prior.<br />Furthermore, she argues that you must let meat come to room temperature before cooking.  For her parameters, this might work well, but I feel it is an unnecessary risk even with the \\"protection\\" of the salt.  You can lengthen cooking with lower temperature to get the inside of a roast done as well if it's thick.  So 15 mins tops at room temp.<br />Don't abandon common sense, or any other sense, when cooking.  Trust your nose and eyes.  The salt isn't a miracle worker.  The times above are enough to let it do what it needs to to achieve the effect she wants I believe.<br />The recipes have been utterly fantastic however.  I still strongly recommend the cookbook.  It is unquestionably one of the best.  I also strongly recommend, as I believe would she, that you take everything in it, ahem, with a little grain of salt.	2002-09-15

Knowing I'm a near-pro cook, she asked if I had this cookbook, so I went out and bought it and thought I'd finally be able to treat her to some fine cooking here at home.<br />Well scratch that thought.<br />This book is full of what I call &quot;adventurous craft cooking&quot; which is where people who don't really know how to cook take humdrum recipes and throw all sorts of flavors into them willy-nilly thinking that's so exciting.  Well, one of the cardinal rules of cooking is if it doesn't add, it subtracts.<br />This book is deep into the negative reaches from all that subtraction.<br />Worse still, they have to go through all sorts of horrifying contortions to satisfy their severe dietary (and sartorial) restrictions...as severe as any other orthodox sect I'm aware of.  This even though their organic produce is fertilized with dried blood, bone meal, and waste from caged animals, and the livestock they are adamantly opposed to exploiting are living far better lives than their handlers or the wage slaves who pick their vegetables.  <br />The vegans are mercilessly cruel to plants, most of whom have no ability to run away.  One wonders if they would eat Julia Butterfly's Luna tree, perhaps perched on a mound of smoked seitan with a soy milk-succanat reduction and forty clashing spices.<br />The cruelty to plants is raised to another level entirely with the recipes in this book, however.  At least I endeavor to make the absolute most of every animal product that comes my way, leveraging millennia of culinary wisdom and discipline.  These poor plants are dishonored by the flailings of people who think they can cook but obviously were unable to learn due to their religious or phobic avoidances.  Their guests may not know much of the difference given their shared syndrome.<br />But for me, this book amounted to a clever means of tricking me into putting something disgusting into my mouth.How fortunate I only had the one vegan guest (and even she was quite disappointed).  And yes, I very much DO know how to cook and I followed the recipe absolutely to the letter.<br />The tree products used to make the book are being honored by being recycled, hopefully into something more enlightening.	2002-07-26

I am pretty close to a pro level cook.  And I wanted to investigate low-carb diets, but not give up my highfalutin habit.  So this book was very promising, but of course I was very skeptical.  (I had been cooking through &quot;Jean-Georges&quot; just before I started this diet, not that that made me fat, it didn't, but it raised the bar a bit on what I expect from a plate.)<br />Anyway let's cut to the chase.  These are some of the best recipes I've ever made, because she uses the smoker (which I ran out and bought) and she also knows how to do all sorts of other great things.<br />I really couldn't care less whether these recipes are healthy or not.  I'm staying on my diet for a few weeks and going back to gourmet cooking when I reach my goal weight.  However I will continue cooking through this book for a long time.  Lots of stuff to learn.  And my meals will be popular with the ladies as well.	2002-07-11

I don't see how they could invest so much money in beautiful photography and printing and yet completely drop the ball in what matters most, making it easy and pleasant to generate the meals.  <br />Of course, that doesn't matter most in selling the book off the shelf, so publishers are getting away with it.  But I will gripe here when I have a chance and punish them for their oversight.  (The thing could have been done in half the time, with a third the salt, and anyone trying it would realize this immediately once it was too late...)  I also want preparation times in my recipes and make-ahead and storage/leftover notes.<br />Otherwise this book is beautiful and has one tempting page after another with plenty of useful Italian translations and an encyclopedia of ingredients and wine all of which sold me the book and I am generally happy enough with it.  But I will defensively make the recipes from now on, now that my trust has been violated.	2002-07-02

Every time I try one of the recipes, I have the most dire predictions...oh no I've ruined all the food I have.  Ruined indeed!  These are some of the best meals I've ever turned out.<br />If you like your food dry, tough, bland, ugly, typical, and difficult to make, there are several other cookbooks that will serve you to a tee.  But if you like your food falling-apart tender and juicy, rich and beautifully spiced, unique and yet quite easy to prepare, this cookbook I've found works fine.<br />Also I'd say that I always choose the finest ingredients but if I had to use less than the best, I would want these recipes, which will make the most out of whatever you've got.  I would give this away as a Holiday gift to anyone who was already at Joy of Cooking level.  And who didn't need to lose lots of pounds.	2001-09-26

This is not only the best book on the subject, it's the best O'Reilly book I've seen in a long time, if ever.  Plus, the author is very active on the Oracle developer forums.  Run, don't walk, to get this one if contemplating using Oracle and XML.  I haven't read the new Wrox book on the subject but would be stunned if it's anywhere near this book.  10 stars.	2001-01-24

However, it's up to you to do the in vivo exposures that, over time, will free you from avoidance.  This isn't her book for patients; this is for the therapists, although perhaps some people like to see things from the other side.	2000-11-26

I have had the pleasure of being treated personally by the author in a group session and everything I was willing to work on is no longer a problem.  I still have a ways to go but it's just my own procrastination.<br />I have never taken any medication and I strongly advise against developing an addiction on top of an avoidance.  I recommend finding a qualified cognitive-behavioral therapist (they do exist, try adaa.org) and doing your homework.  I think group sessions (3-5 people) are actually much better than individual ones, because getting over embarassment of the condition is essential to its resolution.  I was fortunate to have a wonderful group.	2000-11-26

This is virtually essential toward approaching this artist's work.  If you can find one of these, it's well worth it.  The painting on the cover is now at the Hirshhorn in Washington.  I recommend Jensen's work to all those unafraid of art that challenges you in all ways.	2000-11-19
