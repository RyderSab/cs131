(What kind of cookbook has no index??) Second, it bears little actual relevance to the show, other than the anecdotal trivia that Kasey Rogers (AKA Louise Tate) supplies, having been a former cast member.<br /><br />If you are a Bewitched collector, this may be of value to you, but as a cookbook it is a great disappointment. Much as I love the show, I ended up getting rid of my copy of this book, simply because it was worthless in my kitchen, and I am not a collector of the show's memorabilia. It collected dust once I had read through it, and I don't miss it on my bookshelf.	2005-06-29

This is my daughter's favorite book (age 7, autistic). She laughs and laughs at poor Pat, who has his masterpiece pizza eaten by \\"mice by the dozens.\\" I wish I had a recording of my husband reading it to her. I think he enjoys it as much as she does.<br /><br />The repetitious rhyming makes the book easy to read and fun for her, which in turn aids her language development and reading skills. Plus, it's about her very favorite thing to eat. If all books were this much fun, she'd never put them down! Alas, they are not, and even a child who perseverates (some might say \\"obsesses\\") gets bored eventually. My only dissatisfaction with the book is that some of the rhymes are a bit forced. But when you're a child, those descriptions are not so strange, so it's probably the grownup in me.<br /><br />If you have a little pizza-lover in your life, they will adore Pizza Pat!	2004-12-20

The projects are described step-by-step very clearly, and the photos of the pages are clear and bright. Overall, I found this to be a neat book with some really clever ideas. There are things I personally would not do (like use brads and buttons and stuff making the pages bulky and awkward), and I think she's wrong to use original photos and recipes, but that's my opinion. I really loved the idea of using vintage textiles as background art and clip art. It's definitely worth a look!	2004-11-17

The plot is murky at first, and moves in spurts with a slow start. Not until halfway into the book are readers told outright what's going on. The authors do a wonderful job keeping things in the dark, leaving their audience questioning motives and reasons for all of the bizarre and disturbing behaviors the characters of the book exhibit. After that halfway point, things speed up considerably. The situation unravels and all Hell breaks loose, taking the hero, private investigator Deandr&eacute; Mullington on the ride of his life.<br />The dialog is tight and crisp, and very natural sounding. The authors had every opportunity to make this a gore-ridden, gut-wrenching novel where violence is glorified, but chose not to. Instead, the scenes are described a bit generally, allowing readers to add their own visual interpretation. In fact, because of the deliberate vagueness, it adds another dimension of horror to the book, that such things could be so glossed-over.<br />While murder mysteries are not the sort of book I typically read, I was completely engrossed by this one, racing though the last 60 pages, needing to know what happened. The scenarios presented by the authors are such that I can easily see something like this being awfully quite real. It will definitely make me watch the evening news differently for a while.	2004-06-27

Kids can learn about being themselves and being a good friend by Big Al's example. It has a heroic main character who saves the fish who had refused his friendship. What I think could have been done better/differently is to play up the ideas that no matter what you look like, you can be a good friend, and that it's important to be yourself. Clements ends the story a little too suddenly to explore that idea, in my opinion. It does, however, leave room for classroom or parental discussion once the story has been read. This is a sweet book, with a nice message, even if it's not terribly obvious.	2003-09-11

This is not cheap. (But worth every dime!) You just can't go wrong with this collection. It is a fine example of Keats's marvelous craft.<br />One of the things I like about this book (and Keats's books generally) is that it portrays urban settings. As a little girl growing up in a rural Midwestern town, I honestly never noticed that the main character in Snowy Day was African-American, even though none of the kids I went to school with were. That fact was unimportant to me as a child, but I can see the value of it as an adult. Exposing our children to many cultures and races can only improve the way the next generation sees the world. From the bio at the end of the book: \\"Childhood, in his mind, was a colorblind experience.\\"<br />Keats wrote over a hundred books. It must have been hard to pick just 10 for this collection. I think you'll love the ones that were chosen, if you don't already.	2003-03-12

Pros: Good advice, step-by-step approach.<br />Cons: Aggressive approach. Tending toward fashion-conscious.<br />The guerrilla approach to purging your closet may be off-putting for some (like me). However, for the strong-willed and determined, this is a good book. What really disagreed with me was 1) the tendency toward fashion consciousness, 2) the limiting nature of some of the suggestions, and 3) the utter ruthlessness of their method of clearing a closet. I am not interested in being fashionable, I just want to look good. The nature of their suggestions for maintaining a &quot;lean closet&quot; is limiting. It's rather a minimalist approach to clothes, with not a lot of variation. And I am just not capable of getting rid of all the things they think I ought to get rid of. (This is NOT a book for packrats!)<br />Do I recommend the book? Yes, but you have to be really determined to follow their method. Did it work for me? No, because I am too much of a packrat, and just cannot purge my whole closet (which is what I'd end up doing). I much preferred Fabulous You.	2003-03-12

It is, at times, quite sad. Evelyn Ryan was such a remarkable woman, with an amazing story. You just have to read it. She is very inspiring.<br />It says a lot for the skill of Terry Ryan as an author, for the reader to be able to feel so close to the people she writes about. You are right there while you read, you feel the emotion right along with everyone else. While I read, I felt as though I was growing up alongside the other kids, and felt as much sadness as a grown child left home as the younger kids. I was completely immersed in the Ryan family.<br />I highly recommend this book. When so many biographies are of the rich and (in)famous, it was lovely to read about an ordinary woman who was far from ordinary. She is an inspiration to her children, and she will be to you.	2003-03-12

It has lovely photos/illustrations, and thorough notations throughout. I recommend ot for its unique approach to dance, but not for its (sometimes suspect) history. It's an interesting book, with a lot of information.<br />I can see using this book as a form of meditation I suppose that's as spiritual as you want it to be. There are interesting ideas here, and women who are exploring the meaning and origin of dance will probably find it a good read. As women's studies (which is one of the subjects this book falls into), it's a little lacking. She doesn't really provide enough hard evidence with some of her theories and interpretations to consider this a scholarly work. Women who are interested in the goddess will also find value in this book.<br />I recommend it as an interesting read, as long as the reader understands that much of what she writes is an interpretation of history, and cobbled together from whatever sources were available. Since much of women's history was never written, interpretation is necessary, of course, but I don't know how much is interpretation and how much is embellishment.	2003-03-12

Looking Good presents clear advice, lots of illustrations, good ideas. It is occasionally contradictory, and not always practical. This book offers advice that is deceptively simple. With it, you could make-over your entire wardrobe and never complain you have nothing to wear again.<br />This is a thorough and sensible, if time-consuming, approach to making over your wardrobe so you will never be able to say &quot;I have nothing to wear!&quot; again. (Unless it's laundry day, anyway.) It's a very visual book, which is helpful when she's illustrating why one thing flatters and another does not. I like and recommend this book.<br />NOTE: This book has a huge Anglo bias. Nearly all of the illustrations and photos are Caucasian women. This doesn't mean that the fashion tips are flawed, but some readers may be put off by this.	2003-03-12

It's got good *basic* advice on style.<br />It's got great advice on helping you look your best, and apply it to your job to project a competent image. It's an image consultant - just one that won't give you one-on-one personal feedback. For women who are not career women, like me, it's not as useful. (Do stay at home moms need image consultants?

It's a fun guide book to some of the festivals in the US, just the thing if you can't decide where to vacation with family, and want to try something different.<br />I recommend the book. The author gives you contact information and addresses for the various farms, factories and chambers of commerce, but she does not give information on where to stay in the area - that's up to you. Some of these towns are quite small, and only during their festivals do they have crowds of people. Hotels may not be available in some of these places, and she doesn't mention the nearest larger town that might.

If ever a self-help/beauty book could go on a coffee table, this would be it.<br />I am only giving this book 3 stars because of its limited usefulness to a single person. If you're an image consultant, it would be much more useful to you, because of its broad ethnic scope.

How Do Witches Fly? is an interesting, well-researched, and thorough. It's also dry and could be dangerous in the wrong hands. This is a scholarly discussion of the mechanisms used in witches' &quot;flights.&quot; It is absolutely not for the squeamish or kids.<br />Author Alexander Kuklin has a PhD. in plant physiology and genetics, and is interested in how science and the occult relate. This makes him quite qualified to cover his chosen topic. Many of the ingredients are discussed in detail, from what part of the plant it comes from, what the toxin is, and exactly how it works and what it does to you. (Not for the queasy!) Some also have a historical background, with references from ancient Greece or the Middle Ages.<br />It doesn't belong in the hands of anyone under the age of 20. (Fortunately, many of these things are very difficult to obtain.) There are no warnings on the covers, but there are inside. I personally think that the publisher should have a surgeon general's-type warning on the cover. &quot;Warning: Experimentation with the items discussed in this book could be extremely hazardous to your health.&quot; The only reason I don't give it a 5-star rating is because I feel there are too few warnings in the book.<br />My primary reason for reviewing this book is as a means to educate parents who might see this book in their kids' possession. There is nothing on the cover to indicate what's inside and that it's potentially dangerous information. The subject line on the back cover reads &quot;Herbs/Biochemistry/Witchcraft/New Age.&quot; That sounds pretty harmless, right?<br />Secondarily, I think there are a few folks out there who have never heard of this book, and might find it as interesting as I did.	2003-03-12

However, it's far too basic, and not worth the cover price. It's got worthwhile information, just not much of it.<br />At 100 pages, Steligo tries to pack a lot into a slim volume. It's heavily illustrated which can be great for seeing an example of what she's referring to, but that also means that those illustrations take up space that she could be going into greater depth. She uses nearly a whole page to make seven quick points on the advantages of using a computer over hand-writing. (The double-spacing between those points is filler, and unnecessary.)<br />I was disappointed. I wanted to like this book, I tried really hard to like this book. I thought that I might find more information that would help me write a second edition of my family cookbook (I've already written one), what I got was very basic information. Consider this book if you have ***no*** idea where to start. The ideas are good, just too basic for me; I recommend the book for novices. But don't buy it, check it out of the library.	2003-03-12

A fascinating read; highly recommended.<br />Looking for Little Egypt is well-researched, a fascinating history, that is eloquently written. It was not as much about belly dance as I expected; it is exactly what the title says: looking for the legendary Little Egypt. It is a fascinating, murky, brief, and obscured history of a dancer whose existence is more legend than truth. Carlton sought to discover just who was Little Egypt. She was able to dispel a few myths (Twain did not suffer a coronary after seeing her dance), but was left with no solid answers about who that dancer was in the end.<br />If you enjoy Middle Eastern dance or like a good history/mystery, this book is absolutely for you!	2003-03-12

The wonderful photos and illustrations are accompanied by text that seems to indicate a single theme as the author's focus: sex. In my opinion, he's a little single-minded on the idea that belly dance is a sexy dance. Also, don't expect anything but Turkish dance to be discussed in any detail.<br />If you are interested in history of this form of dance, skip this book. There are better ones. If you're interested more in the photos, you will not be disappointed (some of the costumes are quite inspiring!). I rate this book 5 stars for the photography, and its breadth.

Many folks know that eating whole grains is better than eating the processed stuff you get at the grocery story. The problem is, there are relatively few cookbooks for using some of the more &quot;exotic&quot; grains.<br />This cookbook gives you recipes for more than 20 different grains, seeds and nuts. The recipes go way beyond bread, and encompass the globe. You'll find things like Millet Souffl&eacute;, Duck Soup with Barley, Sopa de Avena (Oatmeal Soup), and Gingersnaps (made with whole berry wheat flour). Most of the ingredients are easily obtainable, especially if you have access to a good health food store.<br />The author does a fair job of giving lots of sources for buying some of the less common grains. Websites would be helpful, but I can understand why he would not include them (since web addresses change all the time). A bit of time spent online can put you in contact with any number of suppliers.<br />I would have appreciated more time spent on the section for grinding your own grain. There are a number of home grain mills on the market, and it would have been nice if he had taken some time and discussed the pros and cons of various mills.<br />While cooking with whole grains is part of a healthier lifestyle, this is not a health-food cookbook, nor is it vegetarian. There are meatless recipes, and there are low-fat recipes, but that isn't the point of this book. Livingston is introducing the reader to a vast array of grains and ways to prepare them.<br />Since the recipes aren't any more difficult to prepare than recipes from any average cookbook, the hardest thing will be finding the grains; head to your local health food store. Even some large supermarkets are stocking small packages of whole grains in their health food/organic aisles.	2002-12-29

This is a great book for (food) gardeners and for people who have some land available to them. Although there are suggestions for &quot;nooks and crannies&quot; in your house, most of those ideas sound like ideas for older (draftier) homes.<br />The suggestions for building your own working root cellar are clear, with illustrations to help you plan. There are lists of things that keep well and under what conditions to keep them. The authors even list certain varieties of (for instance) apples that keep better than others. There's a month-by-month plan of what could be coming out of your garden, going into the root cellar, and what could be canned or frozen. If you have a large garden, this is an incredibly useful book.<br />However, those of us with smaller modern homes, smaller yards, and smaller, less heavily-producing gardens will be a little disappointed. As I read this, I came to the conclusion that it would be pretty darned difficult to have a root cellar on our property, because we don't have a useable cool north corner to put one in. Not impossible, mind you, it would just take a lot more effort, planning, and money to build it.<br />I recommend this book highly for people who raise substantial amounts of their own produce. This book will really extend your harvest. With imagination and a little time and effort, you can have a root cellar that keeps your family in fresh food you grew all year long.	2002-09-24

If you have a food dehydrator collecting dust somewhere, get this book and haul it out!<br />This is the best basic book I've seen for preserving foods through dehydration. Not only does she tell you what you need to do *before* you dry it, but she tells you what you can do with the stuff after it's dried. Recipes that are useable, recipes for camping, and some that will surprise you - this is a very comprehensive book.<br />This is a must-have for backpackers who want every ounce to count, since dried foods weigh so little. A must for parents who read the &quot;Fruit Roll-ups&quot; label in horror: make your own fruit leathers! She'll tell you how to make fantastic beef jerky, too.<br />If you dry foods, you need this book.	2002-09-24

This is a friendlier, more personal book than Mary Bell's Complete Dehydrator Cookbook. There's not as much in it, in terms of content, but there are things in here Bell doesn't cover - like drying grains. (Make your own corn chips with this book!)<br />For those who don't have a dehydrator already, or for folks who like to build things themselves, there are detailed plans and instructions to build your own &quot;living foods dehydrator.&quot;<br />If you were to own *only* one book for food dehydrating, go with Bell's book. If you like to have a cooking &quot;library&quot; (as I do), this book is a terrific addition to it. &quot;Try&quot; it - you'll like it!	2002-09-24

No matter your &quot;flaws,&quot; if you take the advice in this book, you will be a Goddess in your costume.<br />Brown's bibliography is extensive, and so is her resouce list.

The instructions are clear, and it has a great index.<br />My one complaint is that it has only a few photos. I like to know what it's supposed to look like when I'm trying a new recipe. I know that's not a deterrent for many cooks, but for those of you like me, that is a drawback. The varied selections and the cultural tidbits between the covers more than make up for that lack, though, and I recommend this cookbook heartily.	2002-02-05

Or at least pretend to be! (NOTE: This is not a Harry Potter book, although it's certainly riding his \\"robe-tails.\\")<br />Not only does this book have some really neat and practical projects (container herb garden), but also has some pretty icky, kids-love-it projects like a terrarium for carnivorus plants and a mold garden. You can make your own wizard's robe, invisible ink (that you can use with your newly-made quill pen), and sew your own journal. The recipes include gumdrops, rock candy, and homemade slime (!). There's bits of history and folklore in it, too, just in case you get tired of making all this great stuff and want to read a while.<br />The illustrations are wonderful,  the writing is engaging, and it has a ribbon bookmark (okay, it may be a silly thing to mention, but I love ribbon bookmarks). This is a very entertaining book. Many of the projects would lend themselves nicely to a theme party, and there are a few suggestions for that, too. Your Harry fan will have a *blast* with the ideas in this book. I can't wait to some of them with my own little HP fan...	2002-01-31

It contains places to fill in all the information that someone other than yourself would need if your child was away from home. Grandma and Grandpa have all the phone numbers, contacts, likes and dislikes, bedtime, and more, all at their fingertips.<br />Far from being a strictly professionally oriented book, there's also places for likes and dislikes, daily routines, and places to fill in behaviors (\\"When I'm sad I...\\") and to fill in what would make the child feel certain ways (\\"these are situations that I feel aggressive/sad/happy/etc.\\"). It would also be a great thing to have if your child ever needed to be hospitalized - the nurses and doctors would know exactly what your child needs, what medications s/he's taking, allergies, dietary needs, cultural considerations, etc.<br />This is an invaluable book if you have a child with needs that perhaps cannot communicate these things to a caregiver. I bought one for my daughter, who is autistic. The next time she visits family, this book will go with her, so that no one has any doubt about what they should do in any given situation. I highly recommend it!	2002-01-31

Thompson's words flow as gorgeously as Springett's spooky illustrations. And just when you think something really *awful* is following her home... Well, now, that would be telling, wouldn't it? : ) The surprise ending of this book, after the delightful creepiness, really is surprising... and yet, utterly perfect.<br />I adore this book. I love the art, I love the story. It's one I read and enjoy even if my child's not around to read it to. The repetitive and cumulative nature of this book also makes it a great book to read to children if you want them to help you tell the story. It would be a fun classroom book in that respect.	2002-01-30

Yes, Ms Spretnak is a feminist; yes, she can be political about it. But I don't think she was presenting an agenda with this book. She took fragments of pre-Hellenic myths, and fleshed them out so they'd make sense. And she did so in a beautiful lyric style!<br />\\"The goal of such work [extending the knowledge of pre-Hellenic culture] is not the reinstatement of prehistoric cultural structures, but rather the transmission of possibilities\\" As we know, history is written by the winners, and when the gods we now are most familiar with, the \\"classical\\" myths, were brought into the culture, the older myths which were more matrifocal largely vanished. Not to devalue Homer, but there is genuine value in these much older myths, just as we hold Virgil and Homer in high regard for their telling of newer gods.<br />The pre-Hellenic myths give us a glimpse into a culture where Hera (for instance) was powerful in her own right, not merely a consort and sister to Zeus. How can knowing two sides of a story be a bad thing? History may be written by the winners, but those who were conquered left traces of themselves behind, too, and you can read about some of it here.	2002-01-21

Written by Wendy Buonaventura (who also brought us &quot;The Serpent of the Nile&quot;) in a very readable and engaging style. If her photo on the back is any indication, this book has terrific information. : )<br />This book takes some of the *work* out of a beauty routine, and makes it a more sensual experience that many Western women should appreciate. Slow down: take the time you crave to primp, languish in a scented bath instead of rushing through a 10 minute shower. Curl up with this book, and rejoice in being a woman, with our mysteries and our power, and dance through life.	2002-01-15

A little bit spell book, a little bit decorating book, she talks about making a house a home through some effort on your part.<br />It's a nice little book with some nice ideas, but she seems to try a little too hard to take Pagan ideas to non-Pagan readers. Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, for instance, presented in a Pagan way might appeal to many Pagans, but not to many Christian or Jewish readers. It has a feel of effort to it, like she's trying to sell the book to a group that never visits the &quot;New Age&quot; section of the bookstore.<br />Still, things are presented in a very clear way, suggesting materials and moon phases for the most appropriate times for the spells. None of the materials are very exotic, so the spells are indeed accessible to anyone who is of a mind to try their hand at a little magic.<br />The index is quite good, but unfortunately no bibliography. Not a bad book if Hestia/Vesta-type rituals are important to you.	2001-10-16

The organization is wonderful, and the suggestions are thoughtful and well laid-out. Ideas are presented with stories from myth to illustrate ideas for each holiday, with crafts, activities and recipes. There's music, too!<br />The activities are not limited to a certain age group, but from toddlers to adolescents. What a great way to introduce Goddesses to little ones! My only criticism is that Gods are largely absent. That's where a parent would have to add their own creativity to fill in that half of the story. In spite of that lack, I still recommend this book for any parent looking to begin or supplement their child's spiritual education.<br />There's no bibliography, but an extensive index, and chapter notes. The resource section is pretty thin, but that could be more due to the lack of this sort of information for parents than lack of effort on the part of the authors.	2001-10-16

The title is what caught my eye, but the author is what made me buy it. I was NOT disappointed.<br />This book is a blend of practical approaches to modern witchery and older folk magic. She suggests easily-obtainable substitutes for the &quot;budget-minded witch&quot; and invites you to adapt spells to suit your individual purpose.<br />The title may be somewhat misleading to someone who doesn't bother to delve beyond it. It's not about curses and hexing, but about taking the phrase &quot;wicked witch&quot; and OWNING it; being proactive in your life, instead of letting things just happen to you. It's about turning an epithet into a badge of honor. (Women who take pride in being called a b**** will know exactly what I mean!)<br />I think this is a fabulous and very usable book, that belongs in every wicked witch's knapsack.	2001-10-14

Too much of the time, I felt like I was sitting in an especially dry sociology class, learning about strange and exotic people who aren't in very close contact with reality. I felt she made Pagans look a little stranger than we really are... but maybe the Pagans I know aren't quite as &quot;exotic.&quot;<br />The scope of the book is broad, and persons interested in an overview of Paganism will surely get an education. Perhaps the christian fundamentalists could read this and see that they have nothing to fear. If you *really* want an overview of &quot;American Pagans today,&quot; save yourself the money and surf the 'Net instead.	2001-10-11

She has applied it to this book beautifully.<br />The Kitchen Witch's Cookbook is a fabulous reference when you want to make something extra special that has a bit more meaning than just food. The recipe sections are a bit too cutely titled for me (\\"Visionary Vegetables\\"), but my preference does not change the fact that the recipes are both exotic and homey, and full of magic. Each recipe lists its magical attributes, so you can be sure that you're choosing the perfect menu. She also suggests celebrations for each one, so if you're feeling frazzled at Yule, she has done the work for you - just flip to the index, and pick your dishes with no fuss at all.<br />Her appendices are terrific, and the bibliography and index are thorough. Whether you're making scones, broom wine, Turkish eggplant or rosemary sherbet, you're sure to find just the right recipe for your next special meal.	2001-10-11

Ms Ravenwolf has a friendly writing style that is easy and lucid. The beginner will be drawn in and be engaged by it. The more experienced Crafter might be a bit put off. Be absolutely clear: this is a novice's book, and a young novice at that. Still, everyone must begin somewhere and this book is not a bad place to start. Parents can be assured that their teens aren't learning how to hex people.<br />The methodology is Wiccan, so that might not be what everyone is looking for. (Not all Witches are Wiccans, remember.) This is practical instruction presented in a non-pedantic way - a good beginning that lays the foundation for more serious books later.	2001-10-11

It gives a creditable history of human nomenclature starting at about 1000 BCE. She discusses how traditions have changed and why, and it's a very interesting read. She gives you meanings behind names of things and people across many cultures, so that if you are choosing a magical name for yourself, you will have a pretty clear knowledge of what your name could mean. She also suggests that choosing a name for a child should be done responsibly, and with a consciousness for that child's future. In addition to the names themselves, there are also guided meditation exercises that may prove very helpful if you just cannot decide.<br />The bibliography is extensive, but the index is a bit weak. However, since the book is so well-organized, the index isn't really all that critical.	2001-10-11

It's subtitled &quot;The Ancient Rituals and Healing Power of Belly Dancing.&quot; It is in part anecdotal, and very charming in that. It is historical and affirming.

I would expect more from a scholar. After finding her errors in mythology, I kept reading to see if the mistakes could be overlooked for the quality of the writing. Instead, I find that she makes Pagans looks like blood-crazed madmen and -women. I grant you, this is a work of fiction, and so portrayals of characters in the book should not be taken as the way modern Pagans really are, but there are an awful lot of folks who think Harry Potter is teaching children witchcraft...<br />At best, this is mediocre fiction. The main character is not terribly likeable, and that makes it hard to care what happens. At worst, this book paints an ugly picture of Pagans, which should not be believed under any circumstances.	1998-01-22
