This point should have been brought out stronger. Another thing which I found mildly annoying is that all main characters are described as physically very attractive, even stunningly beautiful. But other than that, writing is nice and book is a page turner. In spite of some horrible things described, somehow it won't leave a reader disturbed. Which may or may not be a good thing. In order not to repeat past mistakes, books dealing with those topics shouldn't paint the whole picture with such pretty colours to make it easy to disregard horrible details.	2002-07-21

As an unwanted daughter who was scapegoat of my own family, I really felt pity for her. I can understand all too well how much it hurts not to be equally treated as other siblings. I've been through that too, and I wonder whether the pain of seeing my father give my sister money for icecream on a hot summer day while I received none will ever be completely gone. Whatever I did was never good enough, though I know for a fact that my father did show off in front of his friends with my accomplishments. When I got my PhD, my father never congratulated me but he bought drinks to everybody at work. What kind of behavior is that? But I learnt to let go, and forget about it. This is what author should do, too. The more you strive for love and acceptance from people who do not care about you, worse they will treat you. And that's that.<br />I would also like to comment on what some people said about &quot;there are a lot more children who were really abused, didn't have enough to eat, didn't get education, blah,blah&quot;. Emotional abuse is just as bad as physical abuse. I've experienced both, and if I'd had to choose between the too, I would choose latter. It isn't the point that there were orphans who had less food than the author, the point is that her family could very well afford to provide and they deliberately chose not to do so. And since she is chinese, in addition to feeling unwanted which is bad enough she had another thing to deal with which is very serious in chinese culture - loss of face. Which is the worst thing her parents could inflict on her.<br />I would really like to see a memoir from her sister Susan. She is the real hero, she stood up for herself unlike the author who kept coming back for more abuse. When she accepted inferior job secured by her father over much better offer she got on her own, I just couldn't beleive it. She was at least wise enough to leave HK, but she made a mistake not to leave all that behind.<br />I would also like to point out that, after leaving for quite a while in China and having had a chinese boyfriend who insisted that I should be more fillial in my contacts with my own abusive and dysfunctional family (to which I of course said no way!), I find her story quite beleivable. I know many people, some of which are middle aged, who strive very hard to win approval of their parents. I find it so bizzare that for a 30+ year old parents have final say on the issues of friends, job, marriage etc. They are still treated like children by their own families, and this results in really bizzare behavior. I don't think therapy will help much to Mrs. Yen Mah, she is a typical product of her culture. She is extremely lucky to have found a man so far removed from all that materialistic nonsense, manipulation and intrigues.<br />What I felt the biggest fault of this book in addition to her complete lack of backbone and self respect was lack of answer to the question why. I don't think she will ever achieve true serenity until she finds the answer to that.	2002-04-06

The description of how immune system works is oversimplified and suitable for persons who have no previous knowledge of medical topics. The case histories described are truly frightening. Imagine a &quot;holistic&quot; doctor keeping someone (who is also diagnosed with chronic candidiasis) for eight months on intravenous antibiotics. The author gives alternative medicine a bad name. Most of the cases described are &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; which he somehow managed to diagnose in spite of negative tests. What a genius. He also likes to treat his patients with &quot;oxidative therapy&quot; i.e. intravenous hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide must be very versatile substance, you can use it for established applications such as antiseptic or to bleach your hair, and according to Dr. Bock it can also cure anything from cancer to infections. Case study of cancer he presented regrettably died after her cancer spread everywhere, but she was feeling good which he counts as success. Another one of his favourite treatments is photooxydative therapy, where in addition to intravenous hydrogen peroxide he irradiates blood with UV radiation, if I remember correctly at 266 nm or so, which is supposed to &quot;transfer energy to blood cells&quot;. Nothing is said about damage done to the blood cells in the process. <BR>This creature should have his licence revoked. For the record, I have chronic health complaints and use herbal&amp;nutritional  medicine and have achieved releif of the symptoms, so this negative review is not a consequence of any prejudice towards alternative methods. As a physicist working on optical properties of organic compounds, I find his notions of &quot;energy&quot; laughable and erroneous, and I think his treatments can be highly dangerous. If you don't get any solution for your problem from conventional medicine, there are a number of alternative parctices which, unlike those described in this book, do no harm.	2002-01-11

Author takes up very interesting and novel idea and then repeats it ad nauseum. And his supposed solution of the problem is based on false premises and it will never work. He thinks that there is social equality in ethnic tribes. This simply isn't true, because in majority of those women have no say and no influence whatsoever. He says that the tribal living worked for millions of years. Is there any proof that those prehistoric tribes were the same as tribes we observe nowadays? Also, he seems to have the same fault as previous proponents of various solutions of the problem, i.e. has too idealistic view of the human beings. What he proposes in &quot;new tribalism&quot; means that all humans would supposed to take interest beyond earning their wages in success of their occupational tribe. In order to do so, one would need to enjoy the work. Majority of jobs are boring and repetitive. Frankly, I would rather starve than work as a cashier in supermarket or the likes. If people would &quot;make the living&quot; in a way they can truly take interest in, our lifestyle will definitely collapse. There is no way that things can be changed while on the outside would look more or less the same (with health insurance, taxes etc. all in place). He seems to be unaware that consumerism will not be so easily abandoned, and majority simply will not practice self-restraint. Also, with just change to &quot;new tribalism&quot; still remains the main problem - how to feed six billion. Raising the food organically will not feed six billion. Without spraying it with various chemicals you cannot possibly transport it to all who need it. Only supportable way is to have only as many people in one region as that region can feed. Which is something articulated in previous works but conveniently disregarded here. As long as food production and distribution is global instead of local, human beings can neverbe as harmless as sharks etc.  I admit that I have no solution how to change things. I have no &quot;new vision&quot; to offer. And Mr. Quin doesn't either. His new book, instead of offering a new vision instead of new program, seems to be only his way of &quot;making a living&quot; for himself.	2001-08-19

Higgs, the Sunchild, finds it hard to beleive how his sayings got so corrupted and is unable to do anything about it.

However, I was hoping for a book which would go into more detail on different treeatment of women by medical community. It is still too common that for example endometriosis sufferer in extreme pain visits a gyn only to be told that it is all in her head. Episiotomies are still performed without consent even against woman's explicit wishes with no medical justification, which makes it unique medical procedure. Also, some historical facts are oversimplified and book is a bit biased. As a woman and as a scientist, I could not consider this book objective. I do research in male dominated field, and of course I have encountered problems due to being a woman. But nevertheless when I read some (not all) feminist literature I often wonder what do these women want. It seems to me that they are after not equal rights but special treatment.	2001-06-24

However, I didn't like author's attitude that a woman cannot have an orgasm without clitoral stimulation. This may, unfortunately, be true for some women, but my own experience tells me that this is not entirely true, and that there are many ways to achieve orgasms, and none of them should be considered inferior to other ways.	2001-06-19

Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is &quot;relative contraindication&quot; for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic &quot;Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness&quot; which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book).	2001-06-19

Doctors today still get angry if you ask any questions, doctors today still refuse to accept that only patient has a right to make decisions concerning his/her own body. However, I disagree with his comments and attitudes concerning family. The fact that someone is your blood relation is no guarantee whatsoever that that someone would act in your best interest and protect you from unnecessary/unwanted medical interventions. Especialy if your views are a bit more radical than those of the rest of your family. In those matters, I'd rather beleive my lawyer to ensure that my &quot;living will&quot; will be observed, or else they'll be sued. It is still true that doctors are more ften sued for not doing something and not for doing unenecessary things, however from my point of view causing unnecessary suffering for the purpose of minimizing risk for litigation is outrageous. All in all, this book is interesting and easy to read, though I strongly disagree with his views on family especially size of the family. He seems to assume that everybody wants to have dozens of kids, and in his recommendations for home birth once you get married (with which I agree IF you want to have kids, since this is the best way to avoid unnecessary and harmful interventions, including episiotomy which seems to be only surgical procedure for which lack of consent is relative contraindication) he seems to disregard the fact that there are couples who are quite happy to be childfree. Other than his conservative views on family, the book is quite good.	2001-06-18

Though former British colonies still retain lots of resemblance to British health system. My only objection to the book is that it needs an update - lumpectomies instead of radical mastectomies are getting more common in US. However, hysterectomy, often unjustified, is still far to common in US with no hope for change in near future. Also, doctors seem to be unable to understand that different countries have different disease statistics even after you bring them articles printed in medical journals proving that you are right. Medicine does not deserve to be called science, IMO.	2001-06-18

Far better than &quot;Wild swans&quot; by Jung Chang, which seems to be more popular mainly due to its writing style being obviously aimed at Western readers. Nien Cheng writes matter of factly, with little emotion, which is a plus if someone wants to attempt to portray objectively a historical period. However, what bothered me in this book was obvious prejudice and lack of sympathy for members of classes other than her own. She states that her daughter had some friends from worker's and peasants family probably because party made her feel guilty of her family background. She seems to be unable to comprehend that young people adapt and rarely choose to live in the past like she did. I have grown up in a socialist country (I have left after getting my Ph D and finding a job abroad), and when communists gained power they have confiscated most of the property belonging to our family. The author reminds me a lot of my grandmother, who is also very strong woman, but who has also chosen to live in the past, who disapproved of our friends if they had different family background (worker or peasant), insisted on having servants when nobody else did, but fortunately managed to stay out of trouble mainly because grandfather was army officer (though he never advanced above the rank of the captain, due to family background). Because of her, my dislike for any kind of prejudice is about as strong as my dislike for communism, so that I didn't really enjoy this book. Ms. Cheng has without a doubt suffered a lot, and nobody deserves to go through that, but I find it really hard to feel for her since she obviously seems to think herself much better than her fellow humans who happen to hsve less money than she does.	2001-06-10

This is mainly because the book is thinly disguised pro-life drivel. Also, his frequent statements &quot;natural fertility is not a disease&quot; made me extremely angry, since I don't think that I would be very healthy if I had a child every year or every two years. Not to mention overpopulation problem. Also, information in the book, although it contains some good points, is presented in scare mongering way and case studies included are calculated to provoke emotional response. Not very scientific in my opinion. Chapters on Depo Provera and Norplants are very short, though side effects and complications of those are usually worse than the pill. &quot;Minor&quot; side effects are not discussed at all for any of the methods. He entirely missed to address the issue of liver problems for pill users. Based on what I know about hormonal contraceptives (and I don't care at all whether they are abortificaent or not) I would never use them, but I don't find John Wilks' book objective and thoroughly researched.	2001-04-27

The  writer does a great job in describing life of Billy Milligan with  identification of which personality &quot;held the spot&quot; at which  time. However, few details and inconsistencies have annoyed me quite a bit.  For example, letter written by &quot;Ragen&quot; which is supposed to be in  Serbo-croatian is in very, very lousy Serbo-croatian. No person who is  fluent in that language would write anything like that (I am a native  speaker, so I should know). Also, it has been mentioned several times that  Arthur set the rule never to lie. Adalana lied, wasn't bothered a bit about  it, commited a crime thinking that Ragen would be blamed for it, but on the  other hand it has been told so many times that Ragen is protector of women  and children, so he should be unlikely to choose female victim for robbery,  and most certainly wouldn't rape her. Apart from these inconsistencies, it  is rather good book.	2000-08-17
