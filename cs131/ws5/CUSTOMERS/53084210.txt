The Frustrated Patient's Guide to Getting an Accurate Diagnosis	Books	5	16	16	N	Y	Eight Steps to Self-Diagnosis - Very useful book	The authors, an attorney and a physician, explore the problems millions of patients face in finding definitive diagnoses for ailments that are difficult to pinpoint.  <br />  <br />The crux of the book is the eight-step program Dr. Rosenbaum devised to help you define and understand your symptoms. Answering questions in Rosenbaum's eight diagnostic categories will take some thought and perhaps some homework on your part--well worth it, as the answers will provide your own doctor invaluable clues to help him/her diagnose and cure your condition. One very useful chapter tells you how to select the right doctor and make the best use of the time you spend together.  <br /> <br />Providing a psychological boost to those who have been told that their mystery malady is \\"all in your head,\\" (how frustrating is that?) the authors help you deal with the emotional stress and pain that may accompany unnamed conditions. Signficantly, they encourage you to keep on looking for answers. Never give up! <br /> <br />The chapter on children's conditions will be helpful to every parent who has ever been (or will be) faced with a sick child whose exact condition can't be diagnosed even after a battery of tests.  This happened to my son and it was a nightmare for the child, for me, and for an entire team of physicians. I wish I'd had this book then, as no one was ever able to give him an accurate diagnosis. (Come to think of it, I'm going to send him a copy of this book, as some symptoms persisted into adulthood.) <br /> <br />Rich with facts, figures, and case histories, the book will intrigue the millions of patients walking around with undiagnosed conditions, their families, and the healthcare providers who work with them. An excellent addition to your health and medical  reference books.	2005-04-26

I've read virtually all of the low-carb diet books and found nothing new or useful in the Greenwich plan.  The book reads like an infomercial for Twinlabs products, a good-enough company that should employ to author to do PR for them, if they haven't already done so.  I find Dr. Colker's approach rather insulting, as a matter of fact. He presents only the most rudimentary  scientific explanations and just says do this, do that, as if the reading public isn't interested in or capable of understanding and evaluating research reports.<br /><br />Perhaps a dedicated bodybuilder might want to follow Greenwich, which has you ingesting protein supplements from morning til night, but most people would do better reading Barry Sears' Zone books. Sears presents much more detailed explanations of why low-carb diets work and his eating plans are based exclusively on  food. Yes, good, delicious, wholesome food. Imagine that!<br /><br />Actually, I do use whey-based protein powder as part of my ongoing personal diet, but could not possibly choke down the amount Colker suggests.	2005-01-12

Books	5	16	18	N	N	This Diet Works	I lost 15 of my 155 pounds during the first five weeks. That's a 10% loss.  Did my skin sag and bag? Not a bit, as following the plan changes fat into muscle. Instead of sagging I \\"pulled up,\\" look much slimmer and more shapely. Hunger went away within the first day or so and the diet was a breeze to follow. From day one, I felt much more energetic than I had for years. The next 15 pounds until target weight will be slower, no doubt, but decidedly doable.<br /><br />I'd tried Atkins years ago, felt great but did not lose one single ounce. Not one.  No-carb/high-fat diets don't work for some people. (It may be an estrogen thing.)<br /><br />While carbs are \\"restricted\\" on the Protein Power Plan (PPP), you can eat enough veggies to feel full, even during Phase I when rapid weight loss generally occurs.  Just stick to low-glycemic veggies. For example, three cups of broccoli contains only seven grams of carbs.  So, for a woman with a small frame, a meal might consist of three ounces of chicken breast and three cups of broccoli topped with some olive oil and lemon.  I found such meals quite filling. You do drink a considerable amount of water on this diet, which contributes to feeling full.<br /><br />I appreciated all the good science presented in the book and the charts showing amounts of protein and carbs in different foods. Calculating a balanced PPP meal is no problem. And when I felt an urge to eat something illegal, I'd just pick up the book and take a  mini-refresher course. The science is really quite motivating!<br /><br />The PPP is similar to Barry Sears' wonderful Zone Diet. Sears starts you off with more carbs. In fact, so many carbs, it would to take me an hour to eat that big pile of greens.  So this diet is easier for me.  However, I do suggest reading both PPP and the Zone diet books. Barry Sears and the Eades are the smartest diet gurus out there and many of the more recent diets lean heavily on their research.	2004-12-18

As a fairly new  Krentz reader, I found this book just the right companion for a boring evening alone.   The quirky characters and dialogue made me smile. Descriptions of the locations were riveting and logically presented so that action is easy to follow, and the story moved right along. What's not to like? Krentz doesn't pretend to be a literary novelist. Thank goodness!  <br /> <br />A year or so ago, I wrote a very negative review of my first Krentz book, Summer in Eclipse Bay, which I felt was so bad I didn't pick up another of her titles until now.  Glad I did. This one is  in another league altogether.  A nicely balanced book. Very entertaining!	2004-09-25

Of course, this was written when she was a fledgling novelist, so she's learned much from good editors over the years. In this book, she writes in first person, which I found limiting. Supporting characters did not ring true at all.  Also, her political views determine the course of the plot. This is a very bad mistake, I believe.  All of the more conservative types are villians, all of the liberals are  heroes. Identity of killer is predictable for that reason alone, and it's not a good enough reason.  One wonders why this particular book won an Edgar Award.  <br />In her later books, like Legal Tender and Mistaken Identity, I give Scottoline an A for plotting and an A+ for pacing.   They're written in third person and her quirky characters are all interesting if not totally believable. But the books move so fast, you go with the flow anyway.	2002-06-16

Describing the Technique to someone who's never had lessons is like describing chocolate to one who's never tasted it.  Their eyes glaze over and they nod politely, but you know they still don't have  a clue.<br />But that all changed when I bought this wonderful book. I hand it to acquaintances, don't say a word, and they beg me to start teaching again.  A picture is truly worth a thousand words, and this book has hundreds of excellent color photographs. The text is well organized and nicely written. The book gives a wealth of information on the Technique and its applications to daily life. Not only that, but it's beautifully designed, printed on excellent stock -- a first-rate package and well worth the money. If you're new to the Alexander Technique, this is the book to buy.	2001-07-13

I've been to Cuba and read everyting I can find about it, especially novels set there.  Latour reveals much of the miserable truth about life in dingy Havana in the course of this facinating page turner. The novel's hero, Elliot Steil, runs into a mysterious stranger in Cuba who pursuades him to head for Miami. A series of peculiar events in the United States leads him to uncover the chilling secrets of his family. He thinks through his dilemma with  originality, cunning, and practicality so typical of intelligent Cubans who are forced to live by their wits in their beleaguered country. This glimpse inside the clever Cuban mind was the most fascinating part of the book for me. <br />The worst flaw is revealing to the reader the identity of the killer by inference long before the hero gets it. Latour also lards in just a few too many complaints about the money-centric quality of life in the USA, but he may have had to do so in order to get published in Cuba.  <br />I look forward to Latour's next book and recommend it to crime readers and to those curious about the lives of Cubans who make the dangerous trip  to the USA.	2001-05-06

In fact, I wrote for health magazines for years. I read my blood type carefully in this book and also in ER4YT, and the diet recommendations don't exactly jibe. ER4YT tells us that a type AB should drink coffee. LR4YT says avoid it at all costs.  Confusing for a coffee lover. I'd give it up if I really believed it was dreadful for me, but which book do I believe?<br />Both books say that type ABs lack stomach acid. I have too much. Both books tell me to eat a great deal of soy. I don't like it and neither does my digestive system.  D'Adamo doesn't really discuss exceptions to his rules...he just plunks them down like they're the word of God.<br />Under the section on seasonings, both books list ONLY curry and parsley as beneficial for ABs. However, none of the individual ingredients in commercial curry powder are listed as beneficial and some are in the avoid column. That's true of curry powder from health-food stores too. I read dozens of recipes for curry powder online and they all contain &quot;avoid&quot; ingredients.  So how can curry be beneficial? <br />In this book, the lists of beneficial, neutral, and avoid foods are listed in small type on tables covered with a dark grey screen. I find them difficult to read and the pages unattractive. ER4YT was presented in an easier format. I'm also put off by the gloom-and-doom prognoses D'Adamo gives for ABs. He assumes he's talking to sick people, not well people.  I'm much healthier than he thinks an AB has a right to be, and would much prefer it if he would concentrate on positive suggestions to improve my health in general. He does list some supplements that are good for ABs, but doesn't go into enough detail about how much to take. <br />I'm inclined to believe that blood types matter, but because of these and other discrepancies, small but significant to me, I think Dr. D'Adamo's theories are a work in progress.  I am following the diet for my type about 90% of the time. But thebook does not give me any perspective on whether following 90% of its suggestions mean anything whatsoever. Is it all or nothing?  If you eat one &quot;avoid&quot; food does it throw you off altogether, or can you make up with it by eating 3, 6, or 12 beneficial things?<br />This book presents a ton of supposedly scientific evidence, but it sorely lacks reader-friendly touches that would endear it to me.	2001-03-20

Intelligent people seem clueless when it comes to shaping their manuscripts and making them commercially viable. 20 Master Plots offers much more than plot ideas.

I wrote about nutrition for the health magazines for years, had all kinds of information at my fingertips, but when it came to my own health, this  little book offered the most effective answers. I still go back to the  Bieler diet when I need to lose weight, increase my energy, or avoid health  problems that seem to be looming on the horizon.  A friend of mine was a  patient of Dr. Bieler's in the late '60s and reported that the good doctor  was healthy, strong, radiant,  virile, and working a full schedule into his  eighties; apparently he took his own advice.  Bieler did his research at  about the same time that penicillin was introduced, so his work never got  the recognition it deserved. Now, decades later, the public realizes that  the so-called miracle drugs have frightening consequences. Bieler shows how  to keep your body healthy and free of disease and offers dietary solutions  to many ailments.  Basics for everyone: No salt, sugar, honey. Have  &quot;Bieler Soup&quot; daily: zucchini, green beans, parsley, celery cut  up and simmered. These most alkaline veggies balance your system. Read the  book for details.	2000-07-20

In the late '60s and early '70, when it was difficult to find reliable, well-researched information on nutrition that was geared to mainstream readers, Ms. Davis published several books. My  seven-year-old son was always dizzy and fatigued back then, and the doctor  put him in the hospital for a weeklong battery of tests that turned up  nothing.  That's when someone introduced me to Adelle Davis's books. I read  them with great interest and discovered that my child was perhaps  exhibiting symptoms of vitamin C deficiency. I put him on mega-doses of C  and he became a normal, healthy little boy within a week. The idea that  some people need more vitamins than others had not occured to the medical  profession back then.  I used one of Adelle Davis's super-nutrition  formulas on my cat who had been poisoned, had a green tongue, and was  declared &quot;almost dead&quot; by vet...and the cat went on to live 19  years.  I owe a great deal to this pioneering woman and recommend that  anyone concerned about their health read this book and give it due  consideration.	2000-07-20

Then I came upon an article today entitled &quot;Fidel Castro's Deadly  Secret - Five BioChem Warfare Labs &quot; published in July 1998 in Insight  Magazine. Stephen Coonts must have worked from the material in this  article, and with those who supplied the information, to create his novel.  Voila! In this case, fiction is &quot;faction.&quot; <br />Quoting the Insight  article: &quot;Five chemical- and biological-weapons plants operate  throughout the island, according to documents smuggled out of Cuba and made  available to Insight by Alvaro Prendes, a former Cuban air force colonel  who now is the Miami-based spokesman for the Union of Liberated Soldiers  and Officers, a clandestine pro-democracy movement within Cuba's security  services. <br />&quot;The credibility of the smuggled documents is enhanced by  a recent classified Pentagon analysis. Also, these facilities have not been  on the itinerary of such visiting dignitaries as retired Marine Gen. John  Sheehan, the recently passed-over candidate for chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff who enthusiastically embraced normalizing relations with  Havana following a recent round of junketing with Castro.&quot;<br />Besides  being a great novel of derring-do, &quot;CUBA&quot; presents information we  might well consider when we decide what to do about opening US relations  with Castro.	2000-04-29

Glen Park presents the Technique in a way that is understandable to those with  knowledge of New Age healing. While the Technique is arguably not New Age,  having been developed in the last century, it deals with energy and the  movement of energy through the body to create lasting change in your mind,  body, and spirit. I found this book invaluable for explaining what happens  when you give or recieve an Alexander Lesson. If you can possibly find and  use the audiotape that goes with the book, you'll benefit greatly. I've had  many Alexander lessons. Using Glen Park's tape kept Alexander Technique  effects going for me at a time when I could not find an Alexander Teacher.  Both the book and tape highly recommended.

I go to the  health club and do aerobics and weight training, but this book takes  working out to a much higher level, a level where we work toward grace,  balance, and elegance in movement.  We are reminded to pay attention to the  &quot;quality of movement,&quot; and to &quot;move like a dancer,&quot;  which is very good advice, especially for women.  Not that these are easy  exercises, by any means. You can pace yourself, work as hard as you wish,  and know that every erg of energy you expend will bring  you closer to  having a beautiful body.
