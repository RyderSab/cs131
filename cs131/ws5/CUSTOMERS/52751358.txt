This 10-year-old girl writes stories-fictional and non-fictional-in her notebook.  \\"Amelia Writes Again\\" is great because you really learn a lot about how Amelia thinks and feels.  Also, there is more than one even going on in this book, from a drastic change in her school to having a fight with her friend to becoming better friends with that friend.

Although Cleo is pretending to be dumb so a boy will like her, Amelia knows the real truth: You shouldn't have to pretend to be someone else just for someone else.  Also, young children are often intimidated by liking \\"a girl thing\\" or \\"a boy thing\\".  But the real truth is that there is no \\"girl thing\\" or \\"boy thing\\".  There is a \\"you thing\\", and that's what YOU like, not what all girls like or what all boys like.  This is a great book that teaches lessons in a fun way.	2005-07-23

Sure, the drawings are the same, but the content is totally different.  Young kids look up to Amelia, and your role model shouldn't be ignoring a bully.  If you are being bothered by someone, you should tell a teacher or an adult.  Also, the whole space camp part seemed just like school.  It was mostly about space, there wasn't any \\"Amelia\\" in it, just lessons.  I am really disappointed in this book.	2005-07-23

I certainly understand how Amelia feels in \\"Amelia's Family Ties\\"...most of the time.  In previous books, when she talked about her father, she seemed eager to know more about him.  Now, when she gets the chance to meet him, she seems to have an awful time.  Even though what her father did was wrong, he is still trying his best.  OK, so the teddy bear wasn't for Amelia, but its the thought that counts, right?  And what was with the \\"I hate you!\\" when Clara invaded Amelia's privacy?  I would be mad to, but out of respect, for letting me stay as a guest in their apartment, and because she IS related to me, I wouldn't go THAT far.  But, if you ignore Amelia's harsh reactions and feelings toward her new family, the books is really great, along with the rest of the series.	2005-07-23

HOWEVER, IT HAS SOME MATURE CONTENT.  So, anyway, it was a really great book, but there were some drawbacks.  1)So many of these events seemed unreal, such as the debate on the TV Show 2)Becky is very unrealistic, and very irrisponsible.  But, this is good in some ways it adds more funny-ness to her character 3)I thought this book would have more actual shopping in it, but she hardly goes on shopping sprees.  The first chapter is totally unlike the rest, and it gives a wrong idea about the book.  Becky doesn't look at any VISA bills and even the writing style is different.  All in all, this is a great, funny book any shopaholic (or not!) will enjoy!	2005-03-23

Ok, I'm not even far into the book yet, but this book is terrible!  Judging by the first paragraph, you would think this book would be funny, but it totally isn't!  First off, HOW OLD ARE THESE GIRLS!??!  It says on the back that they go to school, so, let's say they are in college, so let's say maybe 23.  Cynthia, a character in the novel, will fly anywhere at any given time, made out with A MIDDLE AGED MAN, and let a man paint a naked picture of her.  What is Zoey Dean trying to teach kids?  That if you are rich and beautiful and have $8,000 that you run rapid?  Also, judging from the back of this book, the main character, Anna, flies to LA, and in just one day, is invited to a wedding, a party in a back lot, and falls in love.  HELLO!??!  Things don't happen that quickly!  Is Zoey Dean trying to tell us that if you are rich and beautiful and popular that everything will go swimmingly?  NO.  IT WON'T.

But now, this book (along with another book called \\"Getting Near To Baby\\" by Audrey Couloumbis) is my answer!  I admit, this book was sort of unreal at the end, but you can't help loving it.  It's about 3 girls, Lila, Meryl, and Caressa who are social pariahs thanks to their freaky fathers.  They do a dumb supper ritual that is supposed to make the first boy you see after the dumb supper date you.  The dumb supper does not go as planned, but yet....it does.

Getting Near to Baby was a heart warming story about two sisters who go to live with their aunt and uncle while their Mom gets her self back together after the baby sister in the family dies.  The two girls, Willa Jo and Little Sister, are always against Aunt Patty.  They certainly have their differences.  Uncle Hob seems like a nobody-character but in the end of the book, he really does sometime outstanding.  The thing about little sister is that she doesn't talk.  She and Willa Jo have their own code, and Willa Jo tells everybody what she wants.  This book is really cool because for the first 50 pages, it tells you about the situation now.  They don't explain anything until they have gone about 50 or 60 pages into the book.  It is great that way because you can make up your own story in your head about what happened.  This book was extremely touching, and when you start reading the last few chapters, you never want to stop reading.  I recommend this book to everyone!	2005-02-08
US	52751358	R2S1AOEJS9CRSD	0670059366	382301013	Dizzy	Books	1	1	9	N	N	Horrible and unreal	This book was horrible and completely unreal.  The plot was obvious from the first few chapters, so once you knew what was going to happen, you had to live through about 25 more chapters of nothingness.  I am a kid, and I found the plot obvious.  An adult who reviewed this book also found the plot obvious.  So, no matter what age you are, you know what is going to happen.  Most of the book is spent at the first festival, and it is just the same stuff repeated over and over again.  Also, they do not describe the characters well.  The describe the setting well, but what do you care more about, the setting or the characters?  Also, this book does not set an example for younger kids.  Dizzy really looks up to Storm, even though Storm smokes and runs from the police.  What kind of example is that?  Also, when Dizzy's Dad finally finds her after SEVEN WEEKS, he hardly acts emotional.  Ask any parent what they would do in this situation and they would tell you they would cry and hug Dizzy for hours and make sure she was okay, then go and hunt down Storm.  After all, they knew she was in Goa.  Also, Storm is 12 or 13, how is she so oblivious to not realize that Storm was lying?  Why would you just go off with somebody who you have hardly heard of who left when you were young?   <br /> <br />In conclusion, this books is totally unreal and stupid.  I do not recommend this book for anyone.	2005-01-30

Hi, I am a preteen who just read this book, Notes From a Liar and Her Dog, by Gennifer Choldenko.  This is one of my favorite books and I couldn't put it down.  So you are probably wondering why I only gave it 4 stars.  This book is about a girl named Ant (a nickname for Antonia).  She doesn't like her family and makes up a crazy story about how her \\"real parents\\" are going to come get Ant and her dog, Tashi (a nickname for Pistachio), the only \\"real\\" member of Ant's family.  Ant is constantly getting in trouble, but when she's not, she's busy hanging out with her best and only friend, Harrison, going to the zoo to be a volunteer with Harrison and the art teacher, Just Carol, and participating in Math-A-Thons.  There are some reasons why I only gave this book 4 stars, though.  Number one, you can clearly see Ant loves her dog, Tashi, and her mother doesn't.  So when Tashi gets sick, Ant takes him to the vet, without her mother's permission, and fills out a wrong address so they won't get billed.  But later in the story, Ant's mother shows Ant's father a brochure about how old dogs don't like to go on long car trips, airplanes, etc.  She tells Ant why she did this because she knew that if anything happened to Pistachio, Ant would never forgive her and her dad.  What I don't get is how Ant's mother cares about the fact that Ant loves Tashi and she wouldn't want anything to happen to him, but when Ant wanted to take Tashi to the vet, Ant's mother said no.  Another thing I didn't like about this book was when Ant brings Tashi to the zoo when she goes to be a Zoo Teen, I'm not going to give it away so I won't give full detail, something terrible happens to Tashi.  Then, the next time Ant goes to the zoo, she brings Tashi and the same thing happens to him.  I found having this happened twice was unneccessary and it was only to make the book longer.  I found it quite boring because many of the chapters took place in the zoo and this crisis happening two times was unrealisitic and a waste of space.  Finally, for most of the book, Ant hates her sisters, Elizabeth and Kate.  Then, you can clearly see that Ant is beginning to appreciate her older sister, Elizabeth.  Then at the last part of the book, Ant still insists that she doesn't like her sisters.  So this leaves readers wondering if Ant has turned over a new leaf, concerning her sisters, especially for her older one.  Other than those three things, this book will always remain one of my favorites.	2004-08-20

If you want to: know what happens with Fiona and Aimee with Ivy, read a great book, or do an easy but still an A+ book for a report, buy \\"Play it Again\\"!	2004-05-14

I've always been interested in reading the \\"Alice\\" series, but I just never got around to it.  But when I saw this book, that is before the first book but made after the first book, I decided to give it a chance.  IT WAS TERRIFIC!  I don't know how it affects later books, but it was great.

But she soon sees that there are some great parts about her new life.  This book was fantastic and I would recommend it and the rest of the series for people who like to read series.  Even if you don't like to read series, if you read this book, you will want to keep reading and will soon see that \\"Starting With Alice\\" and the rest of the series is terrific.	2004-05-09

This book was the 11th book in the Abby Hayes series.  Even though this was the third summer she was in and the second start of school, it was still great.

I loved the third book in the series of Abby Hayes, called REACH FOR THE STARS.  Ms.Bunder and Ms.Kantor are having a play, and it turns out to be \\"Peter Pan\\".  Abby wants a big part, like Wendy or Captain Hook.  But when she auditions, things go unexpected.  Abby doesn't get the part she wanted-exactly.  She gets a part that is the biggest and best and most important in the play.  Everything turns out fine, and everyone is happy.  That is, everyone expect Brianna :).

This book was how Madison meets a new girl, Fiona, her two best friends come back from camp totally changed, and the start of 7th grade.
