This latest Hollywood book by Sam Staggs is even better than the one about All About Eve. This is even better written and isn't inundated with the personal opinions that plagued the earlier volume. This one hits the mark much better in that he tells the story of the making of this classic with well-researched information not disrupted by supposition.<BR>Revealing interviews with cast and crew like Nancy Olson are not only revealing in their tales of life on the sound stage but are actually legitimately informative. Staggs' narrative flows smoothly and makes you feel as if you were present at the interviews and during the research itself.<BR>In addition, this is a fun read. I heartily recommend it.	2002-12-25

Firstly, I found the book to be very confusing. I'm an intelligent person, but I simply couldn't follow it. Facts (as well as many suppositions) were there, but I found that none of it made a cohesive whole. Regarding the suppositions, I am getting more than a little annoyed an non-fiction works that use terminology such as &quot;could have&quot; &quot;might have been,&quot; &quot;probably&quot;, etc. instead of stating actual facts. My maxim is, if you don't know for sure, don't put it down on paper. This was a good idea for a book, but I feel that it fell far short of its mark.	2002-07-14

This, believe it or not, is a simple story, told simply. Although she has had fantastic encounters with the rich and famous and travelled widely the world over, Ms. Derek writes a story of a life spent just as enjoyably in a quiet world as in the fast lane variety. Her story is told honestly, with no baloney thrown in, and I was very impressed at how honestly she dealt with herself. She pulled no punches (which I liked) but didn't make herself out to be a saint either. John Derek comes across as an honest and complicated human being and not the glorified star that some people believed. All told, this was an enjoyable read.	2002-07-14

As a man, there is absolutely no way that I could possibly fully understand what she has gone through. No man can. Her story is absolutely horrifying in that she was forced to endure so much suffering without any visible help being available. Ms. Osmond writes with candor as well as humor and I feel confident that readers will benefit from her sufferings. Dr. Judith Moore adds a very informative section at the close of the book that brings much needed knowledge and help to a very serious condition. I hope that more men will read this book so that they might be of some help to the women in their lives who will go through this devastating illness.	2001-07-19

Many of the letters in this book are charming and thoughtful and the narrative by Miss Carr is just as gentle and loving as her first book. These two books should prove that there is a market out there for books that tell charming stories and entertain readers at the same time. Charmian Carr obviously has no axe to grind regarding her &quot;Sound of Music&quot; experiences and I found it extremely touching that all seven actors who played the Von Trapp children keep in pretty close contact with each other. I highly recommend this book and am secretly hoping that Miss Carr has enough anecdotes and memories to fill a third book. Do we dare hope?	2001-07-17

From birth to death, this book reveals a woman who charted her own course and chose the way she wanted to live...successfully. The book reveals how Mrs. Onassis carefully planned each move in her travels through life. Sarah Bradford does her usual excellent job of relating facts through character development. Many Jackie admirers will, however, be stunned at just how complex and human she really was. For those who have chosen to view her through rose-colored glasses, the reality underneath is a lot more interesting. Far from her reputation as American perfection, this book chooses to present the real Jackie as the flawed, yet fascinating, person that she really was.	2001-07-03

This was an easy timekiller, but do we really need to be reminded that the &quot;Royals&quot; didn't have much use for Diana? Duh! There wasn't much in the way of an untold story here, however well-written the book. It also seems to me that the author threw in some veiled, but well barbed, anti-American sentiments, but maybe I'm just naturally suspicious. Supposedly this book was partially based on interviews with the Princess of Wales, particularly one conducted not long before her death. The author is obviously a talented writer, but none of this is anything new.	2001-04-22

As a previous reviewer wrote, this is a good &quot;airplane book.&quot; No great shakes as literature, but then, it doesn't purport to be. The denouement was pretty obvious in this murder mystery and no grand clues were laid at the feet of the reader, but if you're just looking for a book that will help you kill some time, this will work.	2001-04-13

Since then, Charmian Carr has come out with her latest book, so I thought I should get around to this before I read the new one. &quot;Forever Liesl&quot; is a charmingly written story of the filming of one of Hollywood's greatest gems. I can just hear the friendly voice of Charmian Carr as I read each page. Her narrative is consistently interesting and it was a lot of fun to revisit a special place from my childhood. As usual with any work environment, each person is bound to react differently to the same situations and Miss Carr dutifully reports, with no malice, the behavior of her costars and crew. This book, like the making of the film, was obviously a labor of love for Miss Carr, and her charming reminiscenses make for a very happy read.	2001-03-31

Although I don't agree with everything he says, I have to hand it to him for being honest, and even when he revisits his anger on people like Jerry Falwell, you have to respect the man who was once the boy. Living through the debacle that was PTL would be enough to drive anybody to drink and do drugs and the fact that his basic instincts for survival seemed to keep coming to the fore, has turned him into someone very remarkable. Equally refreshing is the fact that he didn't take a thousand pages to tell a simple story. With a refreshing amount of understatement, he manages to convey everything he wants the reader to know.	2001-03-31

Written about one of the loveliest, most gracious stars in Hollywood history, &quot;Forever Young&quot; is a loving tribute to a great human being. I felt this biographer did well by Miss Young by revealing her flaws without trashing her, and the recurring theme that Loretta Young was eternally seeking to better herself spiritually and to understand how she fit in regarding society. This book is also a rare treat in that I read the whole thing without being inundated with dirt and filth, a rarity in today's show biz bios. Ms. Anderson's writing style is reporting mixed with compassion and a genuine regard for her subject. Loretta Young left us with lovely memories and this book will help to keep those memories alive.	2001-03-24

Initially, I got this book because I am a big fan of Alice Walker. However, Rebecca Walker has her own unique and worthwhile voice. Neither her black mother nor her white Jewish father ever had to experience exactly what she experienced and that's what makes this story fascinating. She is neither white nor black, she is simply Rebecca and she tells her very interesting story with compassion and a remarkable lack of great rage. She spins the tale with an extremely mature point of view, not seeming to favor either parent and not seeming to blame one more so than the other. Both parents, like everyone, come across as remarkably human, warts and all. But the difference is that Rebecca Walker also puts forth the very good qualities that exist in both of her parents. This is a refreshing memoir, not at all along the line of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; and its imitators, but a true account of a life lived in two worlds and still emerging victorious.	2001-02-18

As a lover of movie books about the classic era, I instantly fell in love with Mick LaSalle's book about the screen goddesses of the pre-code era. All of my favorite stars came jumping out at me from the printed page in all their beauty and glamour and reminded me that the era of filmmaking talked about was one of great change, changes that pretty accurately reflected real life, as women especially were evolving from the repression of many centuries. Mick LaSalle writes a very entertaining as well as a very informative story about those marvelous ladies and their films, and it's obvious that he likes and appreciates his subjects. Let's have more film books like this one. Could not put it down!	2001-01-21

When you look at the issues she addresses and then read her carefully thought out responses, so many areas of life that may seem complicated are actually so easy to understand and you wonder &quot;Why didn't I see it that way?&quot; Judge Judy is concise and fully stands behind her convictions that have made her opinions so popular around the country. In an age where &quot;less is more&quot; is a widely accepted desire, the judge lays out her case, makes her ruling, and moves on. Would that the court system in this country move as quickly!

In the most recent biography of the extraordinary Judy Garland, author Gerald Clarke takes an honest but compassionate look at the person that was Judy. Without whitewash, Mr. Clarke tells the familiar (to us Judy buffs) tale of a genius life gone wrong. There are those that will tell you that Judy would have had the same sad life without the career, but since we'll never know for sure, we can at least rely on writers of integrity like Mr. Clarke to tell us the story as it happened without philosophizing and without a hint of rancor, as some celebrity biographers like to do. That Judy Garland was gifted with genius is unquestioned. That she was also human is something that is sometimes overlooked. Mr. Clarke manages to carefully convey the complicated person that was Judy with a neatly flowing narrative coupled with a journalist's knack for concise reporting. This is an interesting read that is highly recommended.	2000-12-08

This he succeeded in doing admirably, for the story that followed kept me fascinated in its very history but also in its author's great gift for storytelling, which, to me, is the greatest way to determine whether someone is really a good writer or not. I was naturally amused at the end of the book when Mr. Spencer decided not to publish the details of his recent family's lives, saying that a modicum of privacy was indicated. However, he didn't mind at all &quot;dishing the dirt&quot; on those who came before. That said, Mr. Spencer, or Earl Spencer as he is styled in Great Britain, tells a fascinating story of a family that, rotters and saints, actually helped shape a nation. As I acknowledged before, the author tells an interesting story in a very interesting way. The author also impressed me with an amazing sense of continuity, considering he included collateral branches of his family into the narrative that somehow didn't detract from the rest of the book. Kudos to Charles Spencer for giving us a fascinating history lesson.	2000-11-23

This book once again proves that America has a writer whose very brilliance of thought makes her an example of &quot;Must Reading.&quot; Her initial essay &quot;To My Young Husband&quot; is so beautifully moving and written that you feel like holding both of them in your heart. The rest of the book is basically fictional, with autobiographical overtones, and, like all of her other books, should be required reading for those interested in fine literature.	2000-10-21

This works well until the author starts throwing in suppositions and references to the film and alternative lifestyles. This is when the book bogs down and loses interest. It does, however, start to pick up again when he tells the story of Mary Orr and the real Eve. Altogether, not as much fun as I hoped it would be, but it does have a certain value for students and devotees of classic Hollywood.	2000-10-15

Not only is hers an  interesting story, but her very readable prose flows along as if it was an  engrossing novel. Putting an actress of her caliber and stature, not to  mention experience and understanding of the arts, into the chair of the  director of the NEA was one of the few intelligent and well-thought choices  our &quot;sociable&quot; president has made in recent years. It only makes  sense to put an artist into this position, because only an artist can  really understand artistic need. The book is so interesting that this  reviewer would enjoy reading any other tomes that Ms. Alexander would care  to write. Her careful delineation of the workings of the NEA made  fascinating reading, adding much information to my admitted lack of  knowledge concerning this controversial agency. It also serves as an  interesting look at Washington politics and the oftentimes frustrating lack  of cooperation that it engenders.	2000-09-17

Author Jay Fultz  recreates an era and a family that at once reminds the reader that it is  indeed those examples of grass roots beginnings that oftentimes begets  greatness and achievement. In addition to relating the tale of Donna Reed's  film and television career, Mr. Fultz also shows clearly the making of a  devoted American citizen, spawned by a classic example of the American  family, i.e., practitioners of hard work, faith, and patriotism. The book  shows that Miss Reed infused her work in Hollywood with elegance, grace and  charm, but never forgetting that she was a person of intellect and ideas  and strong beliefs about the world around her. More hosannas should be  aimed at the legendary lady that was Donna Reed, and Jay Fultz's biography  makes a great beginning.	2000-09-09

I was  touched when Miss MacLaine stopped her own narrative to warn the reader at  one point that what was to follow might be hard to swallow. I found it  absolutely fascinating and quite believable. How many of us could have  fully endured the sometimes painful and wearying physical journey that was  so important to her? Her prose is, as always, a thing of beauty, the most  readable memoirist in recent times. Whether or not you find yourself  agreeing with what has happened to her, the truth is that Shirley MacLaine  is a born storyteller, the highest compliment you can give to a writer.  &quot;The Camino&quot; should rank high on the lists of metaphysical  literature, standing tall and proud next to the author's &quot;Out on a  Limb.&quot;	2000-07-15

Interestingly, the copy of Michael Crawford's autobiography that I read was an English printing and utilized words and  phrases that may as well have been Greek as far as my understanding of them  went. That said, I can't recommend much about this book other than the  beginning, where some good detail was given on the actor's early years. I  was especially looking for some good stories about the making of  &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; but that experience was pretty much given short  shrift in the book. What I found consistently dull was the actor's frequent  references to sexual matters and certain bodily functions which I found  neither amusing nor interesting, certainly not topics that you would enjoy  sharing with several million people whom you don't know. Sorry, Michael,  the story of your life and career could have been much more interestingly  told.	2000-06-25
