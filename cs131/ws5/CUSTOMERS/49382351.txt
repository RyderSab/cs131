It will all make sense in the end.  Hein is essentially telling several stories at once, and laying the layers down one at a time until the reader gets to the end.  Not only do you learn the history of her family and her life, but you learn the history of her community.  In the background is always the Hanford Nuclear site.<br /><br />I find this memoir very sad in a way because the people Hein writes about seem like really good people.  Not that anyone should deserve radiation, but these people were merely going about their day, providing for their families and the country -- only to be slapped with many different medical conditions that ran rampant through their community.<br /><br />Definitely an eye-opener.	2005-07-28

My mom read it and wondered how the author could have lasted without killing himself.  I thought that was pretty drastic thinking, so I read the book and didn't quite feel the same way.  But I'm not a parent (unless my cat counts).<br /><br />The author's childhood was completely abnormal, and no child should have to live through that, but that abnormality was his normalcy and reality, and that really shines through in this book.  It's almost like the author took his situation lightly, although I know that's not true.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who feeds off of honesty because this book is blatantly honest and funny and sad all at once.	2005-07-20

I do remember what it was like to be a teenager, and even with the many issues I went through, I still can't completely relate to the two main characters (Kenny, Junie) in this book.  If anything, it gave me a new perspective.<br /><br />The one thing that I thought was the weirdest was that a man wrote this book.  This book reads female all over it.  I have a really hard time thinking a 17 or 18-year old male would have the thoughts and feelings that Kenny had.  It just doesn't read correctly to me.<br /><br />I did think the book had merit.  Not quite sure what merit, but it was well-written, entertaining, funny at times and bittersweet.  More bittersweet than anything else.  First loves are like that.	2005-05-17

I really liked the first story in the collection, but everything else wasn't that interesting to me.  I would find my mind wandering as I was reading the other stories, and I would go back and re-read.  The only time this didn't happen was with the novella, which is about different slackers, but it was still interesting.  If you read the bibliography at the end and the footnotes, you'll understand where Rick Moody is coming from in the novella to some extent.  Not too far from his own experiences.  I actually thought reading the footnotes was more interesting than most of the short stories.  The booke definitely doesn't hinder me from reading more from Moody, however.  At least it's worth a try.	2005-01-07

Not for the faint of heart or the casual reader.  It's not necessary heavy in content (although it can be a heavy book because of it's almost 800 pages...ha, ha..yeah), but Dixon's writing style can leave your brain in a fuzz.  Basically, he's a stream of thought writer who does not believe too much in dialogue or sentences or even paragraph breaks.  This can be tiring for even the most avid reader.  Once you realize the style is not going to change, and what the paragraph breaks mean (more towards the middle / end of the book), then you can easily get along with Frog.<br /><br />My favorite parts of Frog is \\"Frog's Sister\\" and \\"Frog Fragments.\\"  I found these part more interesting than any others.  While the writing style is the same, the stories are more coherent.  \\"Frog's Sister\\" is about his sister, which you will meet here and there before you get to her own chapter.  I found it really sad, sometimes disturbing, and a bit funny at the same time.  \\"Frog Fragments\\" contain stories about past loves (one as a teenager and one as an adult) plus a mix of other subjects.  The only way you know that you've moved onto another vignette is that the paragraph ends.  This is not the case of all Dixon's writings, however.<br /><br />I will say that Frog is definitely worth the time.  It's a great read for those that read throughout the day but may not have the time to really sit down and read.  You read about the same people over and over, and while you'd think this gets tiring, it doesn't, it merely helps you as you plow through the 700+ pages of Frog.	2004-11-25

No where does the author state all he's writing is dry facts.  He's a creative writer, and you can write creatively based on fact.  It happens all the time.  And why should the author be so PC by changing \\"gringos\\" to \\"American(o)s\\"?  \\"Gringos\\" is to imply anglos, not Americans.<br /><br />Anyway, this book is definitely not for the faint of heart because at times is can be graphic in detail.  I told my husband about some on the stories, the center theme being the dump, and he said, \\"what? they live in a dump?\\"  He's Mexican.  He's never heard of that.  And he's heard many things more than the average person.  The thing you just need to take away from this book is not the brutality but the knowledge that other people do live in extremely harsh situations.  Whether you want to do something about it is another thing, but the most you can do is talk about it.  Mexico is not the only country with such extreme poverty, and this book shouldn't be viewed and as only Mexico's truth.<br /><br />In the harshness, there is still life.  The last chapter of the book demonstrates this.  Also that people do try to help as much as they can.<br /><br />This would be a great book to teach in High School, but I doubt it would ever make the reading list.	2004-10-05

I didn't particularly like the first story in the collection, \\"Checkers and Donna,\\" but I was glad to see that the other stories didn't follow in its lead.  I think it's pretty interesting that (in my opinion) this is the weakest story out of the book, and we don't hear mention of Checkers or Donna until 3/4ths into the book.<br /><br />Anyway.  All the stories leading up to Patrick are really interesting, dark and different.  The story of Patrick, is the epitome of this book and it almost seems like Schickler realized this at some point in his writing career, but didn't want to center is first book around Patrick.  Perhaps he should have because Kissing in Manhattan feels more like a collection of short stories and a novella.<br /><br />I can't say I was too thrilled with the ending of the last story, which is the ending of Patrick's story, but all good writers have problems with ending (and perhaps, it really isn't the end?).  It was too \\"clean\\" and \\"nice\\" for me.  Schickler should have kept with his darkness and used that to create a really interesting ending.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to those that like to read dark dramas with surrealistic tendencies.  Just keep in mind that not everything has to make sense to you - and that what you don't understand may be someone else's reality.	2004-08-11

Ms. Bloom touches on transexualism and a mother's love for her daughter soon-to-be son, death and recovery, breast cancer and the family, death of a newborn -- all situations that do affect people on a daily basis, but aren't the &quot;norm&quot; for the majority.<br /><br /> I think Ms. Bloom is essentially stating that no matter the situation, people are really the same and have the same feelings. If you've ever had any of the above situations touch your life, then I think you can appreciate not only the story that most affects you, but also the other stories to realize that you're not alone -- that other people do love and grieve just as much as you.<br /><br /> I also think it's very timely that love is most realized when someone or something is lost. Makes you think about your life and how you're living it at that exact moment.<br /><br /> I would recommend this book of short stories to anyone-- there's a bit of humor in most stories too, most of it bittersweet, but isn't that how life is?	2004-07-30
US	49382351	R38BC7FXQK9GQK	038526464X	544586058	Wedding Song	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Gets progressively better	While I agree with one reviewer's statement that Wedding Song by Naguib Mahfouz is confusing to read, I also think it's fair to say that as the four characters' stories are told, the story gets easier to follow.  The most confusing by far is the first one, but ultimately that makes sense when you finish the book.  The same story is told four times by four different characters with four different perspectives.  The most confusing is from the character that's furthest removed from the truth of what happened.  Then the father tells his story (who, by the way, is an opium addict -- that should explain something why it's confusing to follow him a bit), then the mother, and finally the son, who knows the full truth.  The son's story is the most interesting because up until that point you'll only be reading perceptions.<br />I think Wedding Song is a nice experiment by a great author and shouldn't be over-looked.  It may not be for everyone, but it's certainly worth the time.  It's a quick read as well.	2004-07-16

It may take some readers a bit of time to get used to the style of the novel, but once you do, you will be taken on various trips between the lives of Pastora and Maximo Madrigal.  The characters share their lives both together and separately to create a well-rounded story.  There's also a bit of magical realism that hints of what's to come from Castillo as an author.  While I wouldn't say this is one of her best works, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in finding something new to read; especially if it was works from a Latina author.<br />This book would also make for a great edition to a literature class.  I think the benefits of a knowledgeable teacher would really flesh out the themes of this novel.	2004-07-08

There were some stories in the middle that make me (gasp!) actually think Ms. Notaro was losing her touch (too many \\"oh, I gotta hurry up and end this story\\"), but then came along the three-part tale of her trip to Disneyland with sis and nephew, and I almost lost it.<br />Do yourself a favor, and don't read this book in public.  It's really awful to want to laugh hysterically (and yes -- you will want to) and you can't for fear that others will look at you weird.  I was stifling my laughter on public transport and while taking lunch at my desk, and each time I sounded like I was desperate to start crying.<br />Anyway, that's just me.<br />I Love Everybody is just wonderful -- especially if you can relate to Ms. Notaro, which I can.  I'm so glad to know that I'm not the only one who really really tries to have &quot;I Love Everybody&quot; days and doesn't succeed.  I too lost my given allotment of patience the first week I was born.  I just love Ms. Notaro, if not for the humor she brings into my life, but because for awhile I don't feel like a loser since I know there are others out there -- just. like. me.<br />Enjoy!	2004-06-18

I personally feel this is one of Atwood's best novels (not as good as Handmaid's Tale, but darn close).  Her glimpse into the future is not that far-fetched in theory although the details are not realistic -- yet.  With technology changing so dramatically and consistently, her future could soon be our future.<br />If you liked Handmaid's Tale, then definitely check this book out.

I'm all for weird books and stories, but Barry Yourgrau's A Man Jumps Out of an Airplane was a bit too much for me.  I liked (and could keep focused) about 25% of the short stories in this collection of flash fiction.  Some of it was just too crazy for me, and some were crazy but with some substance to them.  I think it would be interested to take some of Yourgrau's more substantial short fiction and turn them into movies -- depending on who does it and how it's done, of course.  Take everything literally, and you'll just have a Rene Magritte movie that doesn't really make sense.<br />Hey!  Excellent way to explain Yourgrau and probably a great compliment to him as a writer -- his writings can be greatly compared to Magritte's art.  Enough sad.  If it's your &quot;thing,&quot; then you'll love it.  If you need a bit more to hold a story together, then you may be driven crazy.	2004-05-04

With that said, I had the hardest time reading this book.  Potok's writing style is one that helps my brain wander while I'm reading, and I often had to go back and re-read sections.  The beginning of the book is the densest with narrative description that's often told in 2 different perspectives and later in 3.  I really became interested in the characters about mid-way through the book.<br />I Am the Clay will give any person who hasn't been affected by war in their homeland a glimpse of what life can be like.  This was set during the Korean war, which was not that long ago, so I think we can imagine what it may be like today as well.  No matter where you live.	2004-04-29

I've read a lot of different takes on the story of King Arthur, but Hollick's Kingmaking made the story totally fresh to me.  Some of the complaints I've read about this book is that it's too romantic (I don't read romances, so a little romance can be refreshing) and too violent (what do you expect in war?), and that King Arthur was portrayed as a womanizer (well...he may or may not have been, and this image of him didn't really bother me).  All this was true, but I really don't think it hindered the story, in fact, it just made it more real and fantastic at the same time.<br />I'm now disappointed that the other books in this series are not readily available and at a cheap price.  I happened to buy the hardback edition of The Kingmaking for a dollar (go figure!), and I will now consider this book a treasure.  If you're a fan of Arthurian fantasy or just fantasy in general, this is one epic book worth reading.	2004-04-21

After finally figuring out where we wanted to stay in Boston (location/hotel), I realized that this is all this book is good for.  Yes, it does include a lot of tourist information, but the layout of the book just makes it hard to read.  Or uninteresting.  I used it just for the location of stay and that's it.  I'm going to buy Frommers book on Boston and use it during my trip since Frommers' book layout is much better and includes the same types of maps.  I've used Frommers many times for different trips.<br />I think if you just need a starter book to get your trip going, then this is a good book to look at, but I wouldn't bring it along while you're on the trip.  Maybe go visit your public library instead of buying it or try to find it used.  And, if you're comfortable with the internet, you could just find out the information you need before going on your trip by using some of the travel sites available to get info and opinions.	2004-04-10

You will also get history about each location, what to expect while dining in this locations (with colored pictures of dishes), lists of restaurants w/phone numbers, what to do, where to stay....<br />The layout of the book is lovely, and definitely worth the retail price of the book.  If the cost is too much, try finding it used.  I'm not sure how helpful the book is while you're travelling (my trip to Boston is a couple of month ahead), but it's great to get a feel for the city beforehand.	2004-04-10

If you don't like analyzing and just want to get through your day and life as it hits you, then Talking in Bed will drive you crazy.  I'm stuck somewhere in-between these two types of people, so even though I was slightly annoyed by the character's over-analyzing of everything (even having a puppy -- which is just a small paragraph in the book, not even part of the book as a whole), I did finish the book.  I think if a good editor came along and stripped out about 100 pages or so of Ms. Nelson's novel, then Talking in Bed would have appealed more to me.<br />It's just a bit too much for a situation that happens in life (marriage falling apart, death in family, infidelity -- not really new and shocking at this point of my life).  I'm not even sure if at the end of the novel that the characters have grown at all or learned anything from their experiences.  Only one character seemed to come to terms with something he did (killed his father -- but you have to read the book to understand that's not as mental as it may sound), and once he told his wife about doing it two years later, he was instantly absolved and mentally healthier.  I just find that hard to believe.<br />Talking in Bed has some pretty heavy content but it's not content that I think is necessarily worth the time getting through.  Use your best judgment based on your personality, otherwise you may be completely annoyed that you spent the money on the book.	2004-03-27

Well, let me clarify that statement -- I didn't know that in 2000 &quot;chick lit&quot; would become the &quot;thing&quot; for brain candy and females.  Anyway, I happened upon this book in my collection, just finished it, and I hate to admit it, I did enjoy the collection of stories.<br />It's not all about women and being single -- there are a few stories that are just about the men in Faith's life (can be considered the &quot;main&quot; character although this is a book of short stories).  There's a bit more substance to these stories and the book as a whole, I believe, than what your typical chick lit provides.  It's not about a female sitting around, waiting for a man to come into her life.  Actually, it seems like the author, Elizabeth Tippens, has taken it for granted that this will happen.  The ending pretty much sums this theory up because there is a wedding.  But the wedding is presented in such an unusual way that that's why I thought it was a given.  And no, we don't go to the wedding or even lead up to the wedding, and in fact, the story isn't really about Faith, it's more about one of the men in her life.<br />The ending of Winging It pretty much sums of a life lesson:  You too shall get over &quot;it&quot; (fill in your own blank) and life does go on.  Kinda like turning 30, if you think about it.<br />I really liked the collection of short stories and was pleased to get more out of them than I thought I would.  Great book for a lazy weekend.	2004-03-08

You have to get through three quarters of the book to understand what I'm talking about, but you'll get it.  You think the beginning is shocking?  You think anything in the middle is disturbing?  Just wait until the end.  Based on the graphic details of what occurs to Bobby and Michelle with their, let's call them, captors, I can only assume Mr. Stahl has been there and done that.<br />Overall, it was a funny and sad story, but I don't think Stahl wants us to feel sorry for the main character.  As stated in the book at some point, there's empathy and there's sympathy.  I think Stahl wants us to empathize with the characters but to just stand back a minute and not get too close.<br />Recommended for those that aren't uptight.  If you are, you won't even get through the first couple of pages.	2004-03-03

McEwan's writing is what I would call very British, which to me means a stiffer voice than American writers, and it always takes me a bit of time to get used to British writing.  The beginning starts off a bit slow and sort of throws the reader right into the story without much background, leaving the reader to figure out what's going on and why other characters don't like each other.<br />Before I know it, however, I was already in the middle of the book and really enjoying it.  The ending, which I will not give away, wasn't so much shocking as it was sad and in a way predictable, although we only know half the story before reading the ending.  McEwan has a good sense of chapters and how to use them.  He was flip flop between characters and situations quick enough to keep the ball rolling and to keep the plot interesting plus so that we get to learn more about the characters involved.  <br />I liked how the ending brought in two characters that McEwan didn't write about from their own perspective.  It turns the story right around on us.  Nice affect and not at all a bit jarring.  I also like finding out what people thought about Linley since this perspective was never really shared with us before.  <br />I would definitely recommend!	2004-02-13

We begin with him at about Jr. High age and going all the way through High School and into college.  The tales of Buddy are often funny and sometimes bittersweet.  While each story is its own, there is some weaving between them -- certain characters get mentioned, certain places are repeated, etc., but it doesn't become the same story told again and again.<br />If you're a kid from the 70's, I think you would appreciate this book.  Even if you aren't, the stories are timeless, but certain references would be lost on you.  I wouldn't let that deter you from reading it, however.  It was a time when a kid could walk around the town late at night without any trouble -- it's those kinds of differences that I write of.<br />This is a quick read and really entertaining.  Perrotta is also the author of Election, which was made into a movie -- if you're familiar with that and liked the movie, then I think giving Bad Haircut a try is worth your time.	2004-02-06

Boyle's &quot;The Road to Wellville.&quot;  From the moment you begin reading, you will be (or, should be) sucked into the story.  I've been waiting for a novel to come along and do this to me but also have some sort of substance to it.<br />Every character was unique in his/her own way, and since this novel is based somewhat on history, you also get to learn a bit about Mr. Kellogg (of &quot;san&quot; and cereal fame) and others.  I really like how Boyle took one tiny piece of our US history and just blew it up -- adding fiction to the history -- so that I've learned a bit more about something I wouldn't normally learn about.  Who knew that the cereal business was so competitive let alone ruthless?  Who knew that people flocked to the &quot;san&quot; for treatments we wouldn't necessarily put up with now?  Who knew that specialized diets existed then as they do now -- and interestingly enough, they're fairly similar?<br />Boyles can do what others have a hard time doing -- he can create a great story based on history and never make it dull.  He never lapses into long, drawn-out explanations of things.  He just gives you enough so that you get it and then he moves on.  You can always research on your own!  And, he really knows how to create multi-faceted characters.  You can feel their happiness, their excitement, their shame, their sadness.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who's looking for a great read.  Don't let the length fool you -- it's a really quick read giving the circumstances.  Go to it!	2004-02-03

I didn't read too much into Ms. Gornick's essays; I pretty much took them at face value.  Her writing style can be described as a bit rambling but also conversational.  She probably write just like she thinks.<br />My favorite essay was the first one, which discussed her first jobs as a student.  I just found them really entertaining, and I guess the one I could relate to the best.  The other essays centered a bit around living alone, relationships (both friendships and marriage), and feminism.  Overall, this book is a quick and interesting read.  I certainly wanted to pick it up throughout the day to read - it wasn't a chore.  I'll certainly read more from Ms. Gornick.	2004-01-13

I know that John Updike is one of the more outstanding writers of the 20th century, but I just can't get into his style of writing.  What I enjoyed most about the short stories in The Afterlife were the conversations between characters.  The conversations Updike weaves creates his characters and the plot, in my opinion.  I'm not against rambling thoughts and scenery descriptions, but I'll tell you, there were times when I was reading, and I had to go back and re-read sections because I just began to think of other things.<br />I did like the progression of the story plots.  It seems to go from early marriages to older marriages with a mix of divorces and cheating.  Family structure and dynamics are the theme in The Afterlife, so if you find that a bit mundane, I would stay away from this book.	2004-01-08

Not that this book should be considered a juvenile book, but I really thought I would be reading about adults -- perhaps in New York (based on the title alone), but it was centered around Miranda and how she grew up with her parents and then later with just her Mom, Roz.<br />I did like The Good People of New York -- I thought it was a quick and entertaining read.  I cared about the characters, which to me, means the author did her job.  I think there were some parts throughout the book that could have been shaved down -- mostly the personal thoughts of characters that just went on and on.  That style of writing didn't quite match the subject, which was about growing up.<br />Another thing Ms. Nissen did that drove me nuts was building up a scene to not finish it.  You're just left wondering if the character did what they set out to do (you do find out way later one that she did), but it's a little disarming to have the build-up with no follow-through.  Could be a unique writing style, but I think it would annoy a lot of people.<br /><br />I am excited to read more from Ms. Nissen.  I think she's got a good voice and can tell a really good story.  Not too many people can begin a novel before the main character is born, bring the main character into the world, and then see them through until the age 18 or 19.	2003-12-20

I just finished Wells' Little Altars Everywhere, and with having already read The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, I wasn't sure if this novel was meant to be read before or after each other?  Little Altars is a good book by itself, but since the two are tied together, Wells must have given some consideration as to the reaction her readers would have after finishing both books.<br />Simply put -- they don't match each other.  Yes, the characters are the same, and yes, you do have stories that criss-cross each other -- but if you read The Divine Secrets BEFORE you read Little Altars, you might be a bit put off like I was.  There's a lot more delving into the physical, emotional, and alcohol/drug abuse that all the characters go through.  And we go from when the kids were little to when they're adults (which means the Sidalee's parents are older too at the end of the book), and I just felt like I was not reading about the same characters.  I was actually quite sad to realize that Wells wanted the characters to go through more emotional/physical (and yes, sexual) abuse than we were led to believe.  With The Divine Secrets, you know there's more underneath it all, but you only get glimmers.  And I guess I have to wonder, is this enough?  Do we really need to know more?<br />With that said, I've decided to just read Little Altars as its own novel, without being attached to The Divine Secrets.  It just makes me too sad to think of the same characters in these different facets.  And I truly hope no one decides to make a movie out of Little Altars.  Unless the plot is fluffed up a bit, I think the movie would just be too depressing.  Little Altars was written in snippets from everyone's point of view, which is an interesting concept (albeit, not a new one) and keeps the story as a whole together.  You finally get some answers and you also get to know the brothers and sisters more.  Two thumbs up - but be forewarned if you've already read The Divine Secrets - you might be a bit put off like I was.t be a bit put off like I was.	2003-10-24

Ms. Strauss takes a &quot;taboo&quot; subject and turns it into something we can all read about without guilt and actually enjoy.  I think how you'll take to this book depends on your views about death and funerals, but for me personally, funerals are not really talked about.  They're just something to do when someone dies, and that's that.  So for me, to build a whole book around the subject was a treat.<br />So yes, the main theme in this book is funerals, but each story has it's own plot, it's own twist.  Ms. Strauss goes one step further and ends The Joy of Funerals with a novella that ties all the previous (except one) stories together.  You get to flash back to a story you just finished and then view it from a different point of view.  This was a surprise to me because I didn't read any of the reviews posted here until I finished the book, so it took me a few paragraphs to get that the author was doing this.  It may sound redundant, but in all reality, it's not.  Structuring a novella this way only gives you a different perspective of a story already told without rehashing details again.<br />All in all, I would recommend this point to anyone who just loves a good story.  I read this book fast and kept on thinking how I wanted to pick it up and read, read, read.  I just hope Ms. Strauss comes out with more in the future.  She's on my list a intriguing authors.	2003-10-11

Ms. Grealy has a way with words and thoughts; so much so that she can take a simple thing (becoming friends with a dog, for example), and turning it into thoughts about life.  I hesitate to say you'll &quot;learn something&quot; from her essays -- even though you will -- but it's more than just learning.  Ms. Grealy makes you think.  And her musings are so casually written, that you can help but read on and on and on.<br />There were two essays that I just couldn't read.  Way too serious for me.  But even so, the rest of the book was full of interesting stories that I didn't feel let down that I didn't like two essays from the book.  It just didn't matter.<br />My favorite essay is the first one.  She weaves her story in a rambling, friend talking to friend way, that when you get to the point of the essay, it really hits you.  You don't expect the twist, and I really admire Ms. Grealy as a writer for being able to do that.  Not everyone can lead up to something so momentous and not create a really strangely set-up scene.<br />If you're looking for some quick reading, then I would suggest picking up this book.  If you haven't read her autobiography yet, you'll really want to after reading As Seen on TV: Provocations.	2003-10-04

Each story is written in such a way that you feel like someone really familiar is just talking to you -- face to face -- and you don't want to leave.<br />Second, if you can't read the whole book of short stories for some reason (you would really need a good one), then you need to spend some time reading the last story in the collect, Bullet in the Brain.  I read this story in another collection of short stories by contemporary authors, and it's always been in the back of my head as one of the best.  I just finished reading The Night in Question, and Bullet in the Brain was the ending of Wolff's collection.  Having the chance to read the story again without seeking it out was great.<br />Essentially, Bullet in the Brain is about a man who just can't shut-up during a bank robbery.  But then the ending pretty much slaps you in the face because Wolff took one incident that would basically end any story and just moves it right along.  I would have to tell the ending of the short story in order to explain this -- and I really don't want to -- but believe me, it's the most creative and interesting ending to a short story like itself.<br />I was lucky enough to see a reading performed by Wolff at my university, and I will never forget the author's ease with the audience, and his smooth readings.  Like he knew us all, and we knew him, and the story he wrote was meant just for us.	2003-09-20

From the beginning to the end, I was entranced with the author's weird and twisted sense of humor, and I loved the characters.  You just know that there's so much more going on, and when it's time, you'll learn what you need to know.<br />I've read some of the other reviews posted here saying that the book was terrible (throwing it across the room? SHAME!), and I think that might be true for some people.  Then there's the rest of us that can appreciate strange plot twists and characters that think things we would \\"never\\" think (ha, yeah, right).<br />So, I will leave my review at that.  I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out the anagram at the end of the book (this is a theme that runs through the story).<br />Excellent read!  If you liked Nude Men, then you must read Vapor!	2003-08-28

You're immediately thrown into several stories -- stories that are told within stories and stories that aren't.  It's hard to figure out what's going on when, who is who, why you're even reading the book.  But believe me, you must continue reading...it's worth it in every way.<br />I think the parts that I love the most are when Effie's \\"mother\\" Nora interrupts her story telling of her experience at the University.  Nora's quips are perfect (\\"does this story have a plot?,\\" \\"There are too many characters and I can't keep them straight,\\" and \\"No! Don't kill of Olivia!\\") for how I felt as a reader.  Effie's story (which is a huge chunk of the book) is really funny.  Atkinson holds a dry wit that just continues to roll with each page.<br />And the end...yes, there is an ending, and yes, everything pulls together more coherently than you could ever imagine.  I won't say anything more about the ending.  If your fear is that you won't be able to get through Emotionally Weird, then just take heed that it will all make sense in the end and you should just keep plugging along.	2003-07-30

I hardly ever read the more &quot;mainstream&quot; fiction/thrillers that are written, but I will always read a medical thriller.  Michael Palmer's Side Effects does not disappoint.  This is, in fact, the first novel I've read by Palmer, and I will definitely take the opportunity to do so again.<br />The plot was really interesting, I think the characters were well-developed and real, and the &quot;action&quot; scenes were exciting.  Palmer can take real life and make it that much more interesting by throwing in controversy and conflict.  The relationship between Kate and her husband was a real relationship, and I was glad to see her husband fight so much in the end to save Kate's life and career.<br />If you're into medical thrillers, then I would recommend this book for sure.	2003-07-16

The beginning just -- well -- begins and I admittedly got lost.  But being a fan of Divakaruni, I knew that at some point, I would be glad I kept on reading, and truly I am.<br />Divakaruni is at her most lyrical and poetic in The Mistress of Spices.  And it's not only that -- she really makes you look at yourself and what you want in life.  What's really important.  The risks you need to take in life in order to be happy.  This is what this book is about.  Mixed in is a bit of fairy tale and fantasy, but underneath it all is just life.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, and tack on a bit of encouragement to get through those first few pages.  After you're done reading, go back to the beginning and re-read them.  You'll be glad you did.	2003-06-29

Okay, that said.  I'm now a converted \\"laugh-out-louder\\" because of The Idiot Girls' Action Adventure Club by Laurie Notaro.  Not only could I relate to practically everything Notaro has written about (I am a true Idiot Girl to the fullest extent), but she just hits you with these one-liners and images that catch you off guard, and you have to laugh.  You have to share scenes and sentences and sayings with those that will understand.  You want to shout at the top of your voice how great this book is -- and you want everyone else to feel the same.<br />Every snippet of life that Notaro shares with us is full of humor and a really strange sense of humility.  This is life, kids, so enjoy it while you can.	2003-06-27

McCarthyism and a memoir of growing up -- all in the same book?  Okay, I was game.  This book will knock you off your feet.  Not only do you get a glimpse of a time that you might only read about briefly in school history books (depending on how interested you are), but you get to read about Ms. Belfrage's dramas and traumas and happiness of growing up.  She was trying to find a fit for herself in the two complete opposites in her life:  Her father who was accused of being a communist and was deported from the US and her boyfriend, the West Point cadet.  Tossed in the mix is her mother, whom Ms. Belfrage lived with until age 20, who just cannot relate to her daughter nor her daughter to her (her mother was also deported -- this is when Ms. Belfrage moved in with her father).  There's a great story written here -- and I mostly appreciate Ms. Belfrage's honesty in both the retelling of her personal life and the retelling of a life the was forced upon her because of her parents' choices.  I would recommend this book to everyone!	2003-06-15

I was a bit disappointed by this book, but yet I still really love Anthony Bourdain's writing style.  Bourdain's writing style is the main reason I kept reading Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical.  Anyone who's had to write essays for school (especially essays based on research to back up an opinion), will be familiar with the style of this book.  Basically, Mary Mallon's story, which, admittedly is very brief and could fill up about 10 pages, is strewn throughout 144 pages of Bourdain's historical research, contemplation, and witticisms.  While this is interesting, it's just not really all about Mary Mallon (aka Typhoid Mary).  That's okay - if that's what you're expecting.  If you like Bourdain's writing style and sense of humor, then you'll like this book.  If you want to really learn about the person known as Typhoid Mary, then you can probably do that somewhere else and quicker.  This book is definitely good for entertainment value, but being someone who's had to write many of those \\"let me back up my thoughts\\" essays for school, I can see one when I spot one, and Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical fits the bill.	2003-05-08
US	49382351	R2N6Q8LIGQ4WC2	0394533461	233611554	Clea and Zeus Divorce	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Really Interesting Book	I think Emily Prager is often over-looked when we think of great contemporary female authors.  I've read most of her books, and just recently finished Clea & Zeus.  At first, I'll admit, I had a hard time getting through the first chapter of the book because Prager sort of throws the reader into the lives of these two complex people.  The book starts off on stage, basically, which is not a typical way to start a book -- right in the middle of the action.  Once you realize what's going on, then you, as the reader, can move on and just keep reading.  And keep reading you will.<br />What I love the most about this book is the constant theme of nuclear war -- whether the [surprise] is going to drop or not, and whether Prager is going to even show us what happens at the end.  In the middle of that theme, you also learn about Clea & Zeus, their entourage of friends (and a strange entourage at that), and see the complexity of a marriage; especially a marriage is just a show business world.  Everything's pushed to the extremes of the ridiculous, but in a sense, that's how some people live their lives because it's available to them.<br />The ending -- wow.  Very different from what I expected.  It's one of the few times that I experienced an ending such as the one Prager gives us and wanted more.  I usually take abrupt endings at face value and go on.  I don't need more.  But with this ending, I wanted more.  I want a Clea & Zeus part two -- just because it was that good.<br />Definitely a great read.	2003-05-03

I can't even remember why I bought this book -- I just happened upon it last week, and once I started reading it, I quickly got sucked into the stories of these women's lives.  I read some of the of other comments regarding this book -- that's it's not \\"historical\\" and that it doesn't represented men well (except Emma's husband).  While this is true, I don't think this is a hinderance at all.  Tsukiyama tells a really good story, it's a good read, and you end up caring about the characters immensely.  It's a story about women's lives -- and the differences between them.  While history does play a part in the plot, it's not the center piece.  History doesn't drive the plot, per se, but the different relationships and the difference experiences between daughters and mothers and aunts and, yes, even men drive the plot.  I would highly recommend this book if you just want to escape for awhile.  You might even see a little bit of yourself in one of these women, and you might even learn a bit more about the women that touch your life.<br />Just be prepared for the ending.  It's tragic, but it completes the circle as well.  I think this is when all the women in the story really learn about themselves, if they hadn't before.	2003-04-17

Here's one for all you that &quot;happen&quot; upon this book and haven't read the first book in the series --- you really don't need to read the first book.  There's a synopsis in the beginning that gets the reader up to speed on what's happened, and then the reader can just jump right in.  Granted, I would like to read the first book and the third book, and I probably will (actually, I know I will), but I just want to let anyone and everyone know that Williams has made it possible for anyone to pick up Stone of Farewell and jump right into it.  I felt that Williams did an excellent job in creating an epic story that covers so many characters and locations.  The plot was interesting all the way through, and the ending, while not really an &quot;ending&quot; in the literal sense, it is very satisfying regardless.	2003-02-20

Dobyns' title of this collection grabbed my attention immediately (Eating Naked), and hence, I had to buy it.<br />The first few stories I read in Stephen Dobyns', Eating Naked, I was really impressed.  The stories flowed nicely, the characters were interesting, and the stories made you think.<br />Then, I realized, Dobyns has a fascination on marriages and/or relationships that are falling apart, cheating, and dreams of murdering a loved one (or used to be loved one).  Having one or two or even three stories like this in a collection is fine, but having almost all of them repeating the same pattern, with just the characters and circumstances changing all the time, gets slightly tiring.  I even had to check the author's bio to see if it said whether he was married or not because his characters seem so bitter about their marriages (possibly a reflection on his life?).<br />I was most impressed with the last story in the collection, mostly because it strayed a bit away from the theme of marriage as a wreckage in life, and centered on younger people.  While the theme of ruined relationships was still there, it was tucked away a bit more than the others.<br />All in all, I did enjoy Dobyns as a writer, and would like to read some of his longer fiction.  If you can get past all the stories being somewhat similar in nature, then Eating Naked is a great find.	2003-01-02

There are some stand-out writers included (Malcolm X, Benjamin Franklin, etc.), but also some contemporary writers as well (Julia Alvarez, Caroline Knapp, Paul Monette, etc.). This is a great book to read on your own, but I can really see it benefiting a lit. class at the same time.	2002-12-27

It's about a writer's life.  And the author does a great job at giving potential or even established writers a glimpse into her world -- and I honestly would love to read more about her.  Her life is interesting in itself, and her literary life is even more interesting.<br /><br />This book is inspiring on many levels to me -- I get to see a person's world as a worker in the publishing world and as a writer, and how one person deals with life as it's happening as well as the past.  I really enjoyed reading about Lipsett's college and after college years.  She's experience quite a lot and has been through several if not many tragedies, yet she seems to keep a pointed focus in telling her tale that the reader never feels sorry for her.  In fact, I really don't think she wants you to.  She's almost too subtle in some areas, so much so, that I had to go back and re-read in order to understand what happened to her.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great little find.  I love her sense of humor and her honesty, and I'm also interested in her work (author, editor, ghost writer, etc.) so that's just an added bonus.  If you're a writer or an aspiring one, and you're just plain interested in interesting people, then you should read this book.	2002-09-20

This book is funny, I will give it that, but it can drag on and on and .... well, you get my point.  I liked how the structure of the book changed from a story, to a screen play, to a movie review, and then back to the screen play, but the movie review was just too much for me.  It's really not pertinent to the book at all (in my opinion), so if you get to that point and wonder if you should continue, I'd say no.  Leyner could have shortened it up a bit to keep the reader more interested.<br /><br />There are plenty of authors out there that write in this style of writing and do it much better, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  It's not a terrible read, but it's not anything extraordinary either.  If you're a fan of Leyner, then you'll probably like this one just as much as the others he's written.
