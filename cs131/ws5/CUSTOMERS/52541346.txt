Although I very much liked this book, I didn't LOVE it as I did Jemima.<br />The central character is Catherine Warner; scatterbrained, messy, ready to make a career change, a hopeless romantic and always there for her circle of friends.<br />Catherine lives in London with her best friend Simon (Si) who is tidy, bitchy and also looking for Mr Right. The circle of lifelong friends is completed with Josh and Lucy, who are happily married with Max, a handful of a toddler.<br />In walks Portia, the stunningly beautiful college friend who's known for breaking hearts. Her reappearance unleashes a series of events - the biggest of which leaves all of the friends surprised!<br />\\"Bookends\\" is a story about friendship - twists, turns, complications and how it weathers loves, marriage, children and most of all growing up.<br />It's a light quick read. A perfect Summer book!	2003-06-08

It's been years since he published a novel and even longer since a student showed promise. Enter Angela, a young student with tattooes, body piercings an ability to write, not to mention her whole gammet of &quot;issues&quot;.<br />Slowly the teacher/student relationship developes, appearing innocently at first (at least to Swenson) until he's so far in emotionally it's too late to turn around. Ultimately his life is ruined.<br />&quot;Blue Angel&quot; takes the reader on a wild ride that once you start you can't stop turning the pages! It's EXCELLENT!<br />The ONLY reason I didn't give this a full 5 Stars was, as the other reviews have said, the ending is flat.	2003-06-01

She has a career that she loves and a man she's like to get to get to know better but she needs to put the past behind her and the only way she can do this is by meeting the birth mother who gave her up for adoption. And so begins the story....<br />I found this book just okay. It's a quick read and entertaining with the main character (Sarah) being very likeable BUT I think the reason this book fell short is becuase it tried to take a complicated subject matter and turn it into a &quot;feel good&quot; fiction story.	2003-05-26
US	52541346	R1I8047IL9XOV6	0425168700	890485903	Fortune's Daughter	Books	2	4	5	N	N	Mystical	Fortunes Daughter is about Rae, a young, unmarried girl who is awaiting the birth of her child and Lila, a fortune-teller with no interest in the future who lost her child when she was a young, unmarried girl.<br />Rae and Lilas lives, fates and futures intertwine as each tries to make peace with the past and become a better person for the future.<br />Not knowing the what the book was really about, Lilas fortune telling, visions, nightmares, spirituality stuff was different then what I would normally read. I didn't like how Lila was so emotionally torchered all her life and never fully found peace.<br />Without spoiling the storyline, I can say that as an Adoptive Mom I REALLY didn't like how one element of the book was treated. At all.<br />All in all, it was an OKAY read. I read it in a weekend and like all of Hoffmans other books, she pulls you in with her ability to turn everyday events into enchanting words.	2003-05-02

Woke up the next morning and didn't stop reading until the very last page!!<br />Eden Close is a compelling story of Andrew and his beautiful next door neighbor Eden. Andrew, after many years away, returns to his hometown to plan his mothers funeral. Planning to stay only a few days, he is never the less drawn into the memories of a tragedy that occured one hot Summer night seventeen years ago. A gunshot. Piercing screams.

Along comes a new tenant in her building that is blond, leggy, silicon filled AND interviews celebrities for a magazine. Oh, and her name?

Just like a slice of chocolate cream pie I devoured this book in one sitting. I LOVED IT!!!<br />World of Pies is the story of a young girl named Roxanne who is growing up in Annette, TX in the 1960's. We're there with her through crushes, nail polish, death, pie making, friends and into her adulthood. The book is warm, touching, funny, engaging and fast paced. You genuinely feel like you personally KNOW the characters in the book!<br />The author has a unique ability to build each chapter upon itself, even though they are written as vignettes. We get to know details about each character while still being a quick read.<br />What I also loved about this book is that the main character doesn't have a trunkfull of baggage - she's a sweet person beginning, middle and end.<br />One of the BEST books I've read this year!!!	2003-04-05

Unfotunately it didn't live up to all the hype.<br />The premise of this book, as you probably know by now is a high school art teacher who writes to herself on her Birthday (beginning with #36) reflecting on the past year, what she learned and what she hoped to accomplish the following year.<br />The premise of this book is both unique and original. Unfortunately the content was so dark and depressing that it just wasn't fun to read. I kept hoping that the something/anything good would happen to the character, just one year, but noooo...each year was just more and more depressing then the next.<br />Don't get me wrong, I realize that life's &quot;downs&quot; were what made the book funny (in parts) but couldn't she have had something/anything GOOD happen one year???	2003-03-29

However, it didn't live up to the hype, for me.<br />This book is about Ruby Capote, a single girl who is dissatisfied with both her column and her boyfriend so she sends her best columns and a six-pack of beer to the NY News editor and lands herself a job in THE BIG CITY. She falls for her boss but will their unresolved pasts sustain the relationship?<br />This is a smart, funny, laugh out loud, upbeat look at love, work and friendship. I genuinely cared for the main character. I liked how it ended.<br />Having said that, I only gave this book 3 stars because it was just OKAY. Read better. Read worse. It wasn't great. It wasn't bad. I would've liked to have seen the characters developed a little more. A little more peak into their pasts maybe would've made it a 5 star read.	2003-03-29
US	52541346	RIDO1UNUBGHCF	0786890371	704251230	Cranberry Queen	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Just an OK read	The cover of this book initally grabbed my attention and then the story did.<br />I wasn't thrilled with this book for this reason; in the back of the book the author talks about all the subheadings of this book and how she &quot;would tell herself to finish one chapter each morning and then go eat a cupcake.&quot; It felt like it. This book didn't flow smoothly. It felt choppy.<br />With that said, I liked the story, guineinely cared about the characters and really like how it wrapped up in the end which is why I'm giving it 3 stars. Read better. Read worse. It didn't thrill me however, it was an intriguing sharp read with wit and good characters that leaves you thinking about them long after you put the book down.	2003-03-23

Lately it seems every book I pick up I just can't get into - this one got me from the FIRST PAGE and I enjoyed it to the end. I LOVED this book!<br />Sissy Leblanc is a funny, sexy, wild, charming, Southern Bell of a character that you just can't help but like. She's the friend that you can call in the middle of the night that would come running.<br />Having been married to her husband since she was 17, Sissy's real love of her life comes back to town 14 years later and thus the \\"Scandalous Summer\\" begins.<br />The authors style of writing is wonderful - fast paced but the characters and story have depth.<br />\\"A girl has to find out if there's life before death\\", \\"When making a life decision you can't trust your head\\" are just two of the \\"rules\\" from the Southern Belle's Handbook that Sissy lives by throughout her life.<br />This is SO MUCH BETTER then \\"Ya Ya Sisterhood\\".<br />A funny, touching, warm story. Highly recommended!!	2002-10-13

It's a hilarious look at the day to day life of a Nanny for a (fictitious?) wealthy family of New York City. It's written and inspired by the experiences and observations of two (former) Nannies which really makes this book work so well! You will laugh out loud and also be appalled at how the wealthy interact with their children. It's a quick read that is PERFECT for Summer!

If you liked &quot;A BEAUTIFUL MIND&quot; for it's compelling, moving, interesting, sad, scary, funny, eye opening story, you'll like this, too.<br />The book is about how Rosie's relationship with a 14 year old pregnant, unwed Mother changed her life forever, in ways she never could've imagined.<br />You reach a point in the book (at least I did) when you jaw will hit the ground. You never see it coming and when you're in it, there's no turning back. You HAVE to see how it all ends.<br />It's written well, it's a quick (but deep) read and it will leave you thinking about it long after you've finished reading.	2002-06-05
