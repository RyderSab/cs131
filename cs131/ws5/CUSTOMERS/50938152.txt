First, there are dozen of good essays written by book and film critics included within the pages.  Second, this edition is true to the original, in the sense that it wasn't edited, and was printed in the original layout format.  And finally, the artwork on the front book cover is supreme, it's a very good portrait of Shane; a rugged and mysterious man, not one of those cheesy cowboys as presented on the other editions.	2003-06-08

But since he was one of the rescuer in the 1996 accident, this book is also a very good first hand account of how that tragedy had came to be.  Personally I like this book very much, because Breashears' writing was very inspirational.  By examining his writing, one can't fail to notice that the author is a man with a genuine passion for the mountains; not to conquer them, but to be there.	2003-04-02

Pretty much the autobiography of how a man almost lost his life on Everest, but somehow recovered his body and soul in the end.  This book has got some nice insights into what attracts a man to climb the mountains.  But sometimes it wander too far off to tell us about the author's martial affairs that don't really concern with the main plot of the story.	2003-04-02

However, the stories in this 'Tibet' volume are too politically dominated.  I don't think this book present a holistic view on Tibetan culture.	2003-03-30

Hannibal, is one of those mytical figures that everyone knows of, but few people knows much about.  And I sincerely believe the main reason that the author had written this book, more than 150 years ago, was an earnest attempt to clarfy the mist, and to let people know who Hannibal really was.  This book started with the First Punic War as its background.  All relevant historical facts were clearly presented by the author, which led to a resonable conclusion as to why the Second Punic War was fought.  Having said that, the main focus of this book is the full depliction of the Second Punic War, the war in which Hannibal shines larger than life.  The author went thru great lenght to compare the military, political, and geography components of the two waring parties, the Roman and the Carthagian.  Especially of importance are his full analysis of the military leadership of Hannibal.  The military genius' talents, as well as his weakness as a commander, were all throughly discussed in the pages.  By reading this excellent book, one will not only gain lots of insights about the 'real' Hannibal, but one will also be greatly entertained by a grand lecture in ancient military history and theories.	2001-11-04

As such, most of the chapters in this book are concentrated on comparisons between the Japanese school system and its American counter part.  The author did an excellent analysis on this subject matter, there were lots of insightful ideas within the chapters.  The writing style of this book is crisp and clear, sparkled with touches of humors at various places.  Overall, it's an excellent book to be used for cross-cultural research, as well as a fun and educational book to read about.  The only slight complain I have regarding this book is that since the author had concentrated heavily on the subject matter of 'schools', therefore he had to left many of the other fanscinating aspects of the Japanese culture unmentioned.  It's not an all-around cross-cultural book.	2001-11-04

It was written by an American, who thru befriending the locals, had weaved up their stories of joys and sorrows.  Topics discussed by the author included martial arts, Chinese fine arts, sociological behaviors, political climates, economical policies, and many, many others.  Even thru Chinese society had evolved greatly since this book was written, and some of the informations presented in this book are no longer relevent, but the stories themselves nonethelessly had not lost their timeless charm.	2001-11-03

Basically this is a very humorous book about Dave Barry goes on a trip to Tokyo, pay for by Random House :), with lots of stories about the various mischiefs that he and his family got into due to cultural shocks.  Just like many others of Dave's books, a lot of the 'facts' in this book had been madeuped.  So don't take what it say seriously or else you are going to run into more troubles than Dave when you go to Japan one day ;)	2001-11-03

The story of O could easily had earned a 4 or 5 stars rating when it first came out decades ago.  It was one of the very first books of its kind, and it had a huge shock value as well as creative value back then.  But during the intermediate years from its published date to our present time, the sexual revolution had already made a lot of changes to the SM landscape.  Many new theories and techniques on SM literature had been developed since, which in turn had made the ideas and writings in 'the story of O' seem very primative and out of date. My bottom line is that it's not worth awhile to spent money or time on this book unless: 1) you are doing a research on the history of erotica/literature  2) you are an avid collector and want to collect all the erotica writings there is	2001-07-14

As much as I am a fan of Yo-Yo's music, and with the wish to learn more about this great person, I really felt disappointed after reading this book.  The writer, John Rallo, don't seem to know enough about Yo Yo Ma; his writing style was very deattached, it was written like from the 'fourth-person' or maybe the 'nth-person' perspective.  Marina Ma, Yo Yo's mother, had her name as the co-author of this book; but she didn't done any of the actual penning.  And whatever little information she had related to Mr. Rallo, was common facts that could be found from old newspaper and magazine articles.	2001-05-31

This book offers very compehensive views for people who want to learn about how life inside the IronCurtain is like.  IMHO, it is so well written that reading it beats reading tons of magazne articles on this subject.  As a former citizen who lived in a communist country, I can testify that almost everything that Mr. Orwell wrote in his '1984' is truth to the point.  Reading this book brings back all those nightmares that I had experienced and witnessed there myself. The thing I really like about this book is that although it's a very detailed piece of work documenting on the evils of a communistic social system, but the large amount of information presented in it had not bogged down the pace of the book at all.  In fact, this book is a relative easy and fast paced read, thanks to the good writing skill of the author, the good structure of its presentation, and that sparkling but doomed romance that Orwell had geniously imcorporated into the story. All in all, this is a very worthy book for everyone to read about.	2001-05-19

It's just amazing how the author had managed to refine the lessons about life into the story of 'the Missing Piece', in such a simple yet clarified way.

One can literately feel the sea breeze and the sunshine coming out of this book.  One strenght of this book is that unlike Yukio Mishima's other deeply philosophical works, this book is very accessible to  everyone.  Read it first for the fairy tale like love story, that can  easily be done in 2 days.  Then read it a second time to appreceiate it's  literary value -- the simple but lively characterazation, the beautiful yet  realistic protray of the island landscape/seascape.  <br />In a more subtle  philosophical note, this book express Mishima's believe in the traditional  Japanese values.  Live simple, work hard, harmonize with nature, trust  others, be self-reliance, be courageous; these are the strenght that gule  the island people together and made them prosper.	2000-03-09

Back then the book presented a very good picture of the aristocratic life of early 1900's Japan to me.  I read it at it's face value, as a tragic love story.  The  story was so intense and quiet full of suspense that I went thru 7  sleepless nights in a row to finish this great book. Eight years later, I  have a second reading of this book.  Since I had grown more mature since my  first reading, I am able to detect more of the underlying ideas in the  book.  Ideas such as patriotism VS self-interst, self-gratification VS  self-restraint, are 2 such forces that drive the plot.	2000-03-01
