My favorite was &quot;Easy Street&quot; because the ending was so unexpected. At first, I did'nt like the second story but after sticking with it until the end I was pleasantly pleased. Now the last story was one rollercoaster ride and shows what power money and greed can have on people. The book also contains an excerpt from Carl Weber's upcoming novel &quot;Player Haters&quot; which appears to be interesting. If you want to read something a little different than what's saturating our reading market I recommend &quot;A Dollar and a Dream!&quot; Great stories which have empowered me to keep the faith that my dollar and a dream will manifest.	2004-01-11

While reading Love, at first I found it to be confusing and complicated and as I kept reading, found that the story gradually unfolded with relative understanding (more about understanding this work later). Reading anything by Morrison requires you to do just that \\"READ\\"; there will be NO speed reading Morrison if you want to acquire some gist of what she is writing about or all will be lost with vocabulary nuances that depart from the central thought-which is Morrison's trademark. I did enjoy reading Love for the fact that it does contain some rich prose that is digestible for mind consumption. There is so much story and character within this anemic novel that it is not fully expressed or told with clarity. With Love's storyline and plot there is no way this book should be 202 pages. The mysteriously written ending is rushed and after re-reading several passages several times to get closure, I still don't remotely know what happened at the hotel with Junior, Heed, and Christine; let alone the Romen situation, and also who is the other woman at the gravesite with Celestial??? If anyone can shed some light on this, please email me and put Love in the subject or IM me, because I'm still scratching my head. In short, the book is about Bill Cosey who is no doubt a pedophile and several women adored and worshipped the ground he walked on. Oh, what joy it is to read Toni Morrison!	2003-12-07

Chaka Khan LP and staring at the sexy woman in leather, fur, and feather clippings and wondering \\"WHO IS THIS WILD CHILD\\"! Well, that woman would possess one of the most AWESOME and influential voices to ever sing. <br />Fans have waited years for this memoir and as Chaka states in the book, she's worked on it for years, but was afraid to face all her demons or even remember alot of things, but after persistence from her sister and with the help of others for recollection, decided to finish it in hopes that it would help someone and also to leave something for her children and grandchildren.<br />Chaka! Through the Fire, chronicles her childhood in Chi-Town, her affiliation with the Black Panthers, Rufus, 2 marriages and 2 children, alcohol and drug abuse, diva antics, and the highs and lows of every realm of her legendary career and life. The language in the book is definitely in your face, no holds barred and simply Chaka, but what can you expect from the WOMAN OF FIRE!<br />Thanks Chaka for sharing a glimpse into your life.

A Man Finds His Way is about Dr. Darius Collins a history professor who endures much in his plight for life. Dr. Collins is faced with a hurddle of obstacles. He is discarded by his girlfriend Marcy for another man, he's a dvorced father who must deal with his manipulative ex-wife Cookie, whose proclivities land under media scrutiny, he must deal with his incorrigible son Jarrod, who gets himself in a very tight fix, and he also must deal with students harrassing him as an Uncle Tom. <br />It's also unique to read a novel about an African American male who is positive in so many ways, for example he was a leader in the Warrior Passages program for youths, which prepared black males for adulthood. Also I relished in the absolute relationship Dr. Collins had with his mentor Rev. Boxwell and his friend Nash.<br />As with \\"Bittersweet\\", I enjoyed every aspect of A Man Finds His Way. This book was funny (especially the dating disasters and Player \\"the talking bird\\"), melancholy, encouraging, and most importantly has spiritual principles without being preachy or beating you over the head. I've taken the message of this book as being \\"FOOD FOR LIFE\\" not thought. I'm appreciative for Mr. Johnson's writing style, which has extended my vocabulary. It's evident in the writing that Mr. Johnson is a scholar, who happens to actually be a history professor. <br />This is a story of substance and should be read by those who appreciate a good quality read.	2003-03-10

I had been waiting for this book since the summer and after a long request log for the book at the library, it was finally my time to take on B-More Careful.<br />Even with ALL the grammatical errors, this book still gets a 5, due to the intensity and peerless story set-up. I thoroughly enjoyed the book from the devilish characters to the game action to the lesson learned about the game of hustling. Although this is a work of fiction, nonetheless, it is someone(s) story in some way, shape, or form. I live in a war zone and know people in the game, so it was a little too real, because people actually do get down like the characters in B-More Careful on a daily. <br />Sister Souljah (The Coldest Winter Ever), Teri Woods (True To The Game), and Shannon Holmes are our modern day Iceberg Slim and Donald Goins'. They are keeping it real with what's happening in the inner cities.<br />If you know or don't know the game, enlighten yourself, because what's on the pages of these books are real and only brought to you (the reader) in fiction form.	2003-01-03

The characters in this book will take you on a roller coaster ride with their issues of love, infidelity (the sexcapades are SIZZLING), greed, pride, lies, and deceit. All the ingredients for a blockbuster that main stream readers will feast on.<br />The book also contains a reading group guide, which is excellent for this type of read. It leaves you wanting to discuss the issues and drama in the story. It also includes a sort of reflective self help guide if you will for \\"The Art of Finding Your Soul Mate,\\" which added a little substance for this entertaining read.	2002-10-19

The read is not bad and not great either, but has a big twist at the end, which will leave you expecting another book from the series in the future. <br />Although I LOVE the original characters and your writing skills,  E.

This story is funny, melancholy, food for thought, and a relaxing read with substance. It also holds mystery and suspense thanks to the character Carmen England who is definitely a chameleon in disguise and the spice of this novel.<br />A general synopsis of The Queen Of Harlem is Mason Randolph, who is a part of the upper echelon in soceity sojourns to Harlem. Upon arriving in Harlem, Mason transforms himself into Malik Randolph, this hip hop, slang using homeboy wanna be. Malik answers an ad for a roommate in Harlem and encounters the enchanting and seductive Carmen England, who is a piece of work herself.<br />The primary issue The Queen Of Harlem deals with is escapism from self. Leaving what YOU are made of behind and adapting a new self; a LIE. A YOU that is a facade, and of course there's always a price to pay, because NO LIE CAN LIVE FOREVER and Mason finds out the hard way. <br />The Queen Of Harlem is teemed with eclectic characters you are sure to enjoy. Although this book is not as poignant as his other novels it is still a very worthy and enjoyable read with a message. Mr. Jackson's writing is that of an artist (painter). He definitely has a way with words and MAD SKILLZ.<br />Also recommended: Walking Through Mirrors and The View From Here by Brian Keith Jackson.<br />Enjoy this MIND CANDY!!!	2002-08-28

The characters are definitely people you don't want to mess with, especially that MAMA RUBY, who possesses supernatural powers.

EJD continues to perfect his craft and not dissappoint.<br />Thieves' Paradise takes us on a 3 day journey with a den of thieves who will do anything to earn the almighty dollar to survive. TP has the most action of all of EJD's books. This adventure gives us a myriad of scams, schemes, setups, fights, and of course that EJD erotica (popsicles and ice). EJD also allows us to get reaquainted with a couple of characters from Cheaters.<br />I also enjoyed the fact that this book did not end like a fairy tale, which added even more realism to this story.<br />This is a new type of story from EJD and shows his growth as a writer and gives us readers who enjoy his work something new and fresh.

After reading the first few chapters I thought this would be your typical \\"Waiting To Exhale\\" for brothers' book, but quite the contrary. I found it to be amusing, melancholy, SPIRITUAL, and encouraging.<br />To sum it up, Bittersweet is about 3 brothers. Clifford, the true family man, whose life gets turned upside down; thanks to the wifey. Victor who is somewhat like an O.G. The one that has been there done that and is bitter about the results. And Nate, the good \\"Reverend,\\" who is tempted with forbidden fruit. As these brothers face their trials and tribulations they come together for each other with tough love. That brotherly love that is able to conquer the enemy. This book is laced with spiritual principles that todays fiction books know nothing about.<br />I'm looking forward to future works from this author. If Bittersweet is any indication, Freddie Lee Johnson III will be on FIRE. EXCELLENT BOOK!<br />Also recommended: \\"The Harris Men\\" and the sequel \\"The Harris Family\\" by R.M.

I've read The Bluest Eye, Sula, Beloved (could not finish), and Song of Solomon (I did enjoy, except for the ending), and can not get into her stories. <br />Sula is about two childhood friends, Nel and Sula. Sula leaves and comes back 10 yrs later and dances to the beat of a different drummer; like her mother Hannah (the apple does'nt fall far from the tree). Upon Sula's return birds symbolize the irony that takes place and Nel must deal with the question of &quot;Why did you do it Sula, I was good to you.&quot;<br />I did not find anything spectacular about the book other than learning some new words. Ms. Morrison has a vast vocabulary. If you read anything by Ms. Morrison you may want to keep pen and paper, dictionary, thesaurus, and a Toni Morrison reader nearby to at least try and get a grip on her message. Sula was boring and did not keep my interest.<br />I recommend Song of Solomon, which was a pretty good book and not that difficult to understand. Read Sula at your own risk.	2002-04-29

I won't spill the beans about the challenge she is faced with, you'll just have to read it for yourself. The read is worth it. I must say I admired Anya's faith through it all and it encouraged me to increase my own faith in the Lord with my own personal challenges. I would have given the book a 5 star but the part in the book where the man gives Anya 3 $20's threw me for a loop and it was never clarified. Was Anya a prostitute?

Ms. Files has earned my respect as a BONA FIDE writer with this one. You get a little bit of everything in this hellacious read ranging from voodoo-murders-homosexuality-incest. It's a very hard story in the sense of it's issues, but it's so well crafted and superbly written you can not put it down.<br />I've read Scenes from a Sista, which was a good, light hearted story, but I like a little more UMMPH, Ms. Files read my mind because she gives it up with CHILD OF GOD.

This book brings everything together from Short Junction-Bigelow-St. Louis doing a 360. Great characterization (We get to know a little something about all the characters). There's also alot of foreshadowing and imagery that brings so much life and color to this story.<br />So far this is the best novel I've read this year and in a long time.

Without spoiling it for those that choose to read it, let's just say this is fiction in the truest form. <br />Now the book is not all bad. It has a good story line and could have possibly been a really good book, except for the far fetched phenomenons that result throughout the course of this novel. The erotica in the book is truly HOT, that's why I bumped this up to a 3 star rating.<br />Basically, the book is about a woman who has a sex addiction and her sex partners cause her ALOT OF DRAMA, big time. This novel has several twists and turns.<br />Not a terrible novel, but for the editor it could have used a little facelift. Alot of the slang used in Zoe's childhood is slang we use today and was non-existant in that era. For the ending it was just too much for me, I like to read a book and it seem real not like I know I'm reading a book.

EJD has a very vivid imagination and makes me wonder where did he really get this story from, let me tell ya. The book starts off slow and does'nt truly begin until the character Ayanna comes into play (she's fierce). <br />With this novel, Nicole is the focal point of a love triangle, with two lovers-one male the other female (talk about putting a twist on things). For the life of me, I still don't get what was sooo special about Nicole, because I did not particulary care for her as a character. She was extremely selfish, but whatever it was, she had her lovers HOOKED beyond reason (talk about some serious love). The erotica in the book was EJD at his best.<br />This book is not for the prude, but the open-minded. If you can read E. Lynn Harris then you'll love this book. BIG UPS EJD!	2002-03-06

This stories writing style is very different from previous EJD work. It has a mexican vibe.  This story is not bad, but not great either. The story did not have the EJD flair and the sex appeal was not as hot as previous writings.

Lastly, we have Colin Channer with I'm Still Waiting (**) and that I am.  This story was too long and drawn out.  It was also a challenging read, I don't know if it was because I had to break out the dictionary or because some of the language was spoken in patois.  Whatever the reason I was not feelin' it.  My reaction to this story is not surprising, because I've been reading Mr. Channer's book Waiting In Vain on and off for about 3 months.

As another reviewer stated, it is similar to Soul Food, but the Price family is more dysfunctional.  Each chapter is told through the eyes of one of the family members, which is helpful because it gives the actual voice of each character with clarity and depth to help the reader understand the characters personality and feelings.  The tragic incident in the book really got to me to the point where I had to put the book down for awhile and re-group.  This book is about family and how important family is and to be careful how you treat family because you only have one.

The writing is filled with emotion to let you experience exactly what the characters are feeling at that exact moment of your reading experience.  Whetstone can make you taste air with her writing.  The story is about three sisters who experience misfortune and are determined to stick together to get back to the normalcy they are accustomed. Great characterization and follow-up to Tumbling (which is one of my all-time fav's).	2001-01-01

Angel On My Shoulder is a poignant autobiography of multi-talented Ms. Natalie Cole.  The book covers her life past to present and let me tell ya, it's a miracle Natalie is still alive today; thanks to God's angels.  Natalie candidly talks about her drug abuse, negligence as a mother, two failed marriages, finding God, and many tribulations and triumphs in her 25 year recording career.  I truly admire Ms. Cole for having the courage to write her story and share it with us.  This is a truly inspiring book that I got alot out of through Ms. Coles wisdom to get her life in order.  God Bless you Natalie, much love.	2000-11-13

The book has excellent storylines, however, it tends to be unnecessarily detailed and at times unrealistic.  I enjoyed the beginning of the book and the last two chapters, some of the middle was kind of lame.  The only reason I finished the book was to find out how Sterling would turn out and I must say that McMillan wrote the hell out of the end.  I really sympathized with Sterling even though she was a trip.  Decent book.	2000-11-01

This book traces the estranged relationship Jeremy had with his father, who has just died.  This causes Jeremy to travel back to Elsewhere, Louisiana to face his dead father, family and friends, who he has kept at a distance since moving to New York to become a successful professional photographer.  In his journey home, Jeremy takes us on a trip through his childhood (which will cause the reader to go back down memory lane) to the present and inturn discovers secrets to self discovery that he has never known. Brian Keith Jackson's writing is soooo powerful I could not believe someone his age was able to write with so much depth.  The writing reminded me of Zora Neale Hurston.  The authors of this day and age are not writing at this caliber.  Wonderful story.  Thanks Mr. Jackson for telling Jeremy's story.  Fan for life.	2000-10-30

This book had the potential of being excellent because it carried great storylines, but became too unrealistic and unnecessarily detailed.  Some scenes had me shaking my head saying, &quot;This is truly fiction.&quot;  However, I did enjoy the quotes provided by different writers at the beginning of each chapter.  For something meatier I suggest reading &quot;Tryin' to Sleep in the Bed You Made&quot; by Virginia Deberry and Donna Grant.	2000-10-22

The Coldest Winter Ever is one of the rawest, realest, and ghetto-fabulous  books I've read in a long time.  Not since Iceberg Slim has anyone captured  the vibe that Sister Souljah has in The Coldest Winter.  Winter is the  epitome of a &quot;bad girl&quot; who does whatever she has to to survive  and stay on top, but one must always remember what goes around comes around  and Winter learns this the hard way.  It's funny how a young girl (Winter)  is so smart, but yet so dumb.  Street sense is nothing without common  sense.  Congratulations Souljah for a hard-core, hard edged book that was  worth every penny of the purchase.  If the movie is anything like the book,  it's gonna be tha bomb!!!	2000-09-17
