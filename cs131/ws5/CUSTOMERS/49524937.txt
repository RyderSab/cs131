Bernard Cornwell is by far my favourite author, I love his writing style and it seems to just get more interesting with each new book. <br /> <br />With all Cornwells books you get a great story combined with a remarkably detailed view of life throughout different historical periods.  With this book you find yourself quickly fixated on the story while all the time learning about the culture of the Danes and Britons, a huge amount of research goes into each of these books to provide an accurate account of life many years ago.   <br /> <br />This book was great and I would seriously recommend it to anyone interested in historical fiction.	2005-03-07

Harry Potter has become world renound, the subsequent films have been hugely succesful and a generation of young children all want to grow up to be witches and wizards.<br />The book is fantastic, its a childrens book for all ages.  I would recommend this book to everyone, everyone who hasn't watched the movie.  The old saying 'the book is always better than the movie' stands true with this one, but the movie does spoil the book.  When you know the ending the build up throughout the book is wasted and the read just becomes boring, I can't even hope to read the second book in the series but the third, forth and fifth are books are something am looking forward to reading.<br />The books a simple read, the plot is involving yet simple enough for the younger readers out there.  The characters develop well throughout the book and its generally just a fantastic book.	2004-06-30

If you have never heard of Sharpe or read a book by Bernard Cornwell then this isn't the book for you, this book is a long awaited installment of a great series of books.<br />The thing I like most about this book is not the great adventure Sharpe is unwittingly participating in, you get that with every sharpe book.  Its not even the great accounts of true, historic battles that seem to put you in the heart of the action, you get that with every Sharpe book.<br />This book is my new favourite simply because of the way its written.  The style is still the same just it fits the book better, you just fall right into the book.  The Sharpe series has developed as much as Cornwell has developed as a writer.  The newer books seem to have a 'worn in' feel to them, they fit like an old boot, its a comfortable, fitting read for the Sharpe fan, you won't be disappointed.	2004-06-26

Its a great addition to any book collection.  <br />The story is set during the bronze age, such an archaic and mysterious time.  The story is centered around the construction of stonehenge, and though no one knows why it was created, the author puts forward a great fictional explination.  <br />The story is fascinating, as with all of Bernard Cornwells books you get a great deal of knowledge from each chapter and you get a real sense of what life is like for the characters portrayed in the book.  <br />The late Stone Age - Early bronze age is a time not much is known about.  From a few archeological discoveries historians have pieced together a rough idea of how life was for those early humans and Bernard Cornwell takes that one step further in this great book, Stonehenge.	2004-04-14

This book is set right after Sharpes siege.  It pretty much continues on from there.  <br />This book puts the penisular wars to rest.  The peace has left the winning British army being disbanded and sent home.  But Sharpes nemesis, Ducos, has one more torture to put Sharpe through.  The book sees Sharpe and Fredrickson (followed always by Harper) on the run from both the British and the French armies.

After reading the whole Sharpe series twice I decided to go ahead and purchase this book.  At first I didn;t know what to expect, I figured it would be over just as quick as it started.  This is the case, 60 pages takes maybe an hour to read.  But the story, like always, grabs you from the start and keeps you reading.<br />These books are pretty much for Sharpe fans only, little about Sharpe is given away through these books.  It is just a quick Sharpe adventure.  I particulary liked Ransom.  <br />These two stories are a must for any Sharpe fan out there.  <br />5 Stars.	2004-01-28

In this book Richard Sharpe and companions travel to England, the whole book (bar an epilogue and an introduction) is set in England.  Personally I didn't like it at first, it lacked the French connection which, to me, is a major factor that makes the Sharpe series so great. <BR>This book lacks the intense action of other Sharpe books and focuses more on the homefront.  Sharpe is sent back to England to find recruits for the South Essex regiment, he quickly discovers that his task is not going to be as easy as he thought.  His rifle is replaced by his mind and his sword, his wits.  <BR>He has to fight on a new battlefield, a politicians battlefield.  To some this would seem an interesting twist in the Sharpe saga, to me it seemed to detract from it, I like the action and detailed description of battles.  But being part of the Sharpe series I felt compelled to read it and this is the last book (at present) where the British are still fighting in Spain, this book kicks open the door to the next set of books, Sharpe in France.<BR>3 Stars only, not the best Sharpe but Sharpe nonetheless	2003-12-17

US	49524937	R2PJMO2U0UW91R	0465023282	431315804	Empire	Books	5	23	43	N	N	A Great Book	The British Empire was the biggest, most powerful Empire ever known both militaristically and economically.  Success like that doesn't come without a price.  Many atrocities were committed and no amount of justification can change that appalling part of British history.  However even in these modern times atrocities are committed all the time by nations on every continent of the world.  Terror it would seem is part of human nature now as it was back then.<br />Many reviewers go on about British atrocities, how the empire was built on other people's sufferings but was America not built on Indian land?  The author fails to note many arguments of how what Britian did was no different to what empires both old and new have done.  Where thousands of Indians not killed or forced out of their homes to make way for new American settlements?  In a time were humanity was less then kind and generous Britain achieved what had never been achieved before, almost complete world domination.  It modernized much of the world, brought order were there was none and kept down many evil dictators bent on world conquest (Hitler, Napoleon...).  <br />The book is not an apology for British rule but a refreshing look at the benefits of British rule, what Britian brought to the world.  It doesn't skip the bad points of that nor justify them, it a good view of British history.<br />5 Stars<br />It's a great book!	2003-11-16

I hope to see more of Hakeswill in future Cornwell books, though am sure soon the character will become old and tired and have to be killed off.  Robert Knowles is back, its nice to see some previous characters, and to see how they have developed.  <br />The book is based around the siege of Badajoz, a bloody battle with an infamous ending.  As with all Sharpe books you get an insight into the history of the British army, its refreshing to get an insight into the British army back in the 1800's that not from Hollywood (the murderous soldiers in the patriot etc...).  The British army prevented the world becoming one big French Empire in a campaign that today is largely forgotten.  Many people talk of Napoleon as the greatest military tactician of his time, but many people don't remember how Lord Wellington beat he and his marshal's.  This series of books really brings that great part of British history home. <br />A great installment of Sharpe	2003-10-31

The book kept my attention from the start and although it seemed the plot came together to easily it was still a great read.  It seemed a bit to good to be true that Tim Bell managed to formulate a whole plan from some conveniently placed files but that's that.  The book seemed to end a bit to quickly for my liking but the story more then made up for it.  I would definitely read more books by Gayle Rivers.<br />It's a book told from the 'bad guys' point of view, but as always the good guys always win.  Poor Tim Bell.<br />4 Stars	2003-09-11

Still though, it's an awesome book and well worth a read.<br />In this book Sharpe makes enemies with a powerful guerilla leader, El Catalico.  El Catalico is a master swordsman and Sharpe is no match for him with a sword, and in the inevitable battle between these foes, Sharpe must rely upon his means of fighting.  <br />The book is set during August 1810, you get some good education about what happened during that time Anglo-French war.  Almeida, a huge fortress under British control is destroyed, you get a very detailed and highly visual description of the explosion that destroyed the fort in the book.  The rest is in the book, but the story is great and well, typical Sharpe.<br />4 Stars	2003-09-04

After finishing this book I thought it was one of the best of the series.  This is the book that pits Sharpe against as Enemy like himself, Brigadier Loup is a great French commander, he commands an 'elite' Battalion known as the Loup Brigade.  Like Sharpe's own rifles, these are a well-trained unit.<br />The book in general is typical Cornwell writing, you get a dose of history, a bit of romance and a whole load of heroism and action.  Once you read a Sharpe novel the battle scenes get you gripped, you find yourself living it, smelling the acrid cannon smoke, tasting the foul, salty gunpowder of the muskets.  This book is typical Sharpe and then some, the battle with Loup is like a clash of the titans, I recommend this book greatly, its one of the best of the series.<br />5 Stars	2003-09-04

This book, like all before, had me splitting my sides with laughter.  <br />It's the usual stuff, Stephanie has to find a skip (someone who has violated their bond order) as well as manage her love life and deal with the (Seemingly) the whole neighbourhood breaking into her apartment.  So the story, Stephanie has to find an Indian guy who skips his immigration bond, while on the case she gets caught up in a complex internet game of cat and mouse (I think the author had the internet idea as a way to plug IBM's new Ibook).  The story takes Stephanie and her entourage to Las Vegas in search of the missing Asian guy and well the rest you have to read.

Sharpe's Eagle is the first of many books by Bernard Cornwell in which his character, Richard Sharpe is a member of the British army in the years around 1800.  I didn't read the book in the order they were written, I read them chronologically, but this book is still the best regardless.<br />This book introduces Cornwell's fantastic writing style, he educates us of the British actions throughout many different campaigns.  He is very detailed on a number of subjects, from how the battle was fought to the steps in which a cannon is loaded.  After reading these books you feel like you know a great deal about such an important point in our history.  <br />This book introduces us to the upper class in-adequacies surrounding the British army of the time.  Rich upper class 'snobs' became commanders by buying their commission, this left a greatly trained army to be run by untrained commanders.  In this book an arrogant Sir Henry Simmerson, thinking he knows best, goes on to disgrace his whole unit by losing the Kings colours.  It's then down to Sharpe, with the help of his immense bravery and courage to restore his regiment's honour.<br />It's a great introduction to a truly interesting and gripping series.<br />5 Stars	2003-09-02

Sharpe's Rifles is the book in which Sharpe gets his first command.  It's the bringing together of two characters that will see the peninsular wars to an end.  Sharpe meets Harper for the first time in this book, and it not what I expected.  It is however a great tale of how the two soldiers came together.<br />This book puts Sharpe in Spain, during the British retreat towards Corunna.  This is a dark point for the British in the peninsular wars when French victory seems not so far off.  Sharpe, while second in command of a detachment of riflemen cut off from the main British force, is soon to face the most challenging point of his career.  Sharpe has to learn quickly when his commander gets killed and leaves him in charge.  He needs to earn the respect of his men and lead them to victory.  It's a great story and a great look at how Sharpe came to be so admired by his men.  This book starts of many of the features that make the Sharpe series so great, it's a must read for all Sharpe fans.<br />4 Stars.	2003-09-02

Bernard Cornwell is a historian first and storywriter second, at both he is superb.  Trafalgar is possibly the most famous naval battle in British history and it just so happens to fit in with the Sharpe timeline.  Naturally as a historian Cornwell would want to put Sharpe in this position and am glad he did.  I found this book to amazingly interesting.  The account of the naval battle is both detailed and gripping.  He recounts the events with such accuracy its amazing how he made it seem so interesting and not just a report from a history book.<br />The book has all the ingredients that make the Sharpe series so great, you just have to read it to love it.  <br />I give this book 4 stars, and it's well deserved.	2003-08-31

Sharpe, now an officer, takes his heroism to a new level during the battle.  The killing grounds of Gawilghur is where Sharpe becomes famous, already a hero to his General, he becomes a hero to the men.<br />The book see's an end to Sharpe's time in India, but it's a great finale to an awesome campaign that has seen Sharpe go from a lowly raw recruit to a hero with a commission.  As with all Sharpe books history is told through Sharpe, this makes the book highly educational and interesting, the story is gripping and packed with action.

Like the book before its building on the Sharpe character by showing how he became to be an officer.  We also see the younger version of Sharpe, the Sharpe who has not yet commanded troops, the Sharpe who has only ever received orders opposed to giving them.  It's different to the future books in that respect and if your a fan of the Sharpe series you see it gives Sharpe's Character alot more Depth. On top of that we get a great action book and an in-depth history lesson.<br />The date is 1803, Muslim armies supported by Arab and European mercenaries are planning an invasion of India.  McCandless drafts Sharpe from his quiet post, where he has spent the last 4 years, to hunt down a renegade English soldier.  During his time behind enemy lines Sharpe is faced with great temptations and its down to him to decide his allegiance.  To the British army, or to the Mahratta army.  His choice is an obvious one and as the story progresses, by doing what he does best, being a soldier, Sharpe finds himself in a situation where the outcome will change his life forever.<br />It's a great story and a great lesson in history.  A tiny British army is faced by a huge Mahratta army, the British are vastly outnumbered and outgunned but with true British determination they go forward and fight.  The rest is history, enjoy the book, I did.<br />4 Stars	2003-08-31

This book is the one all Sharpe fans have been waiting for, Sharpe before he got his commission.  The book sets Sharpe as a raw recruit off to fight in India.  As with all the Sharpe books you great a great insight into the battles fought in the past,  this book is no different.  <br />The history lesson we get here is of the siege of Seringapatum (1799), the island fort of the Tippoo of Mysore.  Sharpe sets of on a mission with the promise of promotion and finds himself going from prisoner to hero.  The rest you have to read, i don't want to spoil the plot, just know its a great read from a great author.<br />This is the first of a series of books set in India (Tiger, Triumph, and Fortress) all of which are fantastic.  The book introduces us to the beginning of the Sharpe Hakeswill relationship, which is a great part of the Sharpe series.<br />This book sets Sharpe off on his voyage, which will one day see him serving next to the Prince of Orange at Waterloo.

It takes the book past Sharpe to the actual event's he was written into.  The British success in defeating Napoleon in the pennisular wars was a major turning point in world history, this book helps us better understand the struggle it was to defeat Napoleon.   <br />Cornwell does a wonderful job at describing the events that took place to each relevant Sharpe book but this book takes it one step further.  <br />It's a truly educating book, a must for anyone wanting to take their interest in history a step further then the Sharpe series.<br />4 Stars.	2003-08-29

This is a modern, well written book, its been written solely to educate the 'less-informed' people in our society.  Me, being one of these less-informed people found it a very interesting, thought provoking book.  <br />I like that he explains how modern thinking has evolved from old ideas.  He tells us about old theories and how they have influenced modern ideas.  He points out the flaws and weaknesses of many theories while still maintaining respect for the thinking behind them.<br />Hawking, who obviously has a lust for trying to figure out the inner workings of our universe emphasizes his love of the subject and he tries to convey that to the reader.  He makes the most complex of scientific thinking somewhat understandable through easy to look at drawings (in someway its a great book just because the drawings look so different).  He also uses a lot of humour to bring some refreshment to reader (although I did personally find this to be kind of 'geeky'). This is definatly a book written for the modern world.<br />Admittedly though, the subject is a very complex one; not everyone is destined to become a great thinker like Hawking's.  You can water down the theories, simplify to the equations, even emphasize the theology with clever illustrations.  Truth is it's still a difficult book to read and understand.  Hawking's does his best, and it a very valiant attempt, but no amount of humour and simplification will make this an easy to understand book.  <br />3 Stars	2003-08-27
US	49524937	R39ZUKZV9DYIG	0140269959	801296901	All Necessary Measures	Books	3	13	13	N	N	The SAS effort in Bosnia, more thoughts then action.	Spence travels to Bosnia as part of the SAS effort in the war torn area.  He explains in detail their particular mission and its very interesting to see what these guys actually did over there.  We don't hear much about the things these guys so we don't give them the respect and honour they deserve.  All Brits know about the SAS but we don't know what they do everyday to protect us and people around the world.  Spence gives us a taste of a typical SAS mission outside of the Middle East.<br />I found this book to be very detailed, an insight into the emotions and humour of the SAS.  Its lacking in the action department so hardcore action fans will get a little tired after a while.  What action parts it does have are superbly detailed and thorough in giving the reader a good understanding of the events.  <br />The book gives a good interpretation of the SAS missions over in Bosnia, not the whole UN effort; it's a good educational read from that aspect.<br />Spence writes how its impossible not to become emotionally attached to the situation in Bosnia, you can't maintain your moral objectivity while serving there and he gives a good account of why.<br />I highly recommend Spence as an author if not for the action just for the insight into the SAS he provides.<br />3 stars (in comparison to his other book its not as good but his writing style deserves a 4.5 star rating)	2003-08-26

Each of the books so far has proved to be a fascinating insight into how these guys operate.  Although the book is fiction, Nick Stone's actions are based on what a real SAS soldier would have been trained to do.<br />In this book, Nick Stone's life isn't going all that great, His adopted daughter Kelly needs full time medical care and that doesn't come cheap.  Nick Stone is forced to take a lucrative freelance job that would pay for Kelly to get the treatment she needs.  As always the plot constantly keeps you guessing and maintains your interest right through to the end.<br />As far as the series goes this book gets 4 stars, my favourite is the first book, remote control, but this book is fantastic none the less.	2003-08-22

The whole series of books is great and this is no exception.  Andy McNab obviously decided when writing this book that he needed to give his character some extra depth.  In this book we see Nick Stone make some serious human decisions.<br />After reading this book you come away with a lesson in survival, in a way it teaches you jungle tracking skills and gives you a good insight into how special operations are coordinated.  If you're an SAS or any kind of Special Forces enthusiast it's a good read just to get inside the mind of a professional elite soldier.<br />I enjoyed this book greatly, the plot keeps you guessing, and its never obvious what's going to happen.  Am not going to spoil the book am sure if you want to find out what its about you just read the Amazon.com review but if you enjoyed the rest of the Nick Stone series this book is going to make you very happy.  <br />4 Stars	2003-08-22

After reading the first few pages I was hooked, it got my interest right away.  Andy McNab maintains his successful down to earth writing style, he is descriptive but to the point, its rare you find yourself bored by a flood of inconsequential technical details.<br />The character, Nick Stone, is like McNab an ex SAS soldier.  He now lives his life doing deniable operations for the British intelligence agency.  The rest you just got to read to find out.<br />It's this book that opens the door to what I hope will be a very interesting and somewhat educating series of books.  McNab's down to earth sense of things shows in the way he writes the book, Nick Stone is no super hero, he can't take out a whole regiment of soldiers with a few grenades and an Uzi.  This is the kind of book I have been waiting for, a book written by a guy who knows what he is talking about, he knows his characters limits and he doesn't breach these, I only hope this is maintained through the series.<br />I particulary like the obvious advertising placed in the book, it must be nice to be offered such a large sum of money to mention a product in your book, nice one Mr McNab!<br />I give this book 5 Stars.	2003-08-22

Nick Stone the Ex SAS trooper does deniable operations for the British Intelligence Service.  In this story Nick Stone is Blackmailed to hunt down an old 'friend' believed to have changed her allegiance.  <br />This story is great, I really enjoy reading Andy McNab's books, his writing style is so down to Earth, and he gets his point across with remarkable ease.  I like the way he emphasizes that although Nick Stone is well trained, he isn't superman. He can't bust down a door, dive on in and take out 5 bad guys with 5 well aimed shots as he would if he was starring in a Hollywood movie.  Life isn't like that, as McNab served in the SAS and is, himself, a well trained soldier, there is no one better to write this kind of book.  <br />Its fiction but its believable, and as the events in this book unfold, you realize that Nick Stone is just a human and years and years of SAS training can only do so much.  The poor guy is still a sucker to his emotions.<br />This is a really great book but I really recommend reading it in order, McNab doesn't spend much time explaining what happened in the previous book so in order to fully get the story I recommend reading 'Remote Control' First.<br />4 Stars, although a great book, its not the best of the series.

In an act of desperation she decides to get her duck loving uncle to give her a job as a bounty hunter, chasing down criminals in the New Jersey Ghetto.  <br />My wife was always laughing when she was reading these books so one day I took a look myself, thinking it was another 'women's' book I was reluctant to show an interest at first but then I got hooked, I went on to read he next nine books and they just seemed to get better.  Just when you think nothing else can happen to this poor woman something does.  If she isn't being stalked by some crazy heavyweight boxer she is burning down funeral parlors with her old Grandmother in tow.<br />These books are great; interesting story lines will keep you guessing while hilarious scenarios will keep you laughing all the way through.  <br />A well deserved 5 Stars.	2003-08-21

This is the first, and as yet only, Peter Benchley book I have read.  It won't by any means be my last.  <br />This book made me want to keep reading, in a way I now wish I didn't, my fear of the ocean now goes far beyond that of a fear of jellyfish (a childhood incident).  <br />This book is truly a good read, it tells the story both from the point of view of the human characters but also the 'beast' itself, what drives it to do what it does and how it is that it has come to be in the situation that it is in.<br />I give this book 4 Stars, I look forward to reading other Peter Benchley titles.	2003-08-21

The classic King James Version is hard for many people to understand.  Although it is the truest translation available I find reading it in conjunction with a NIV clears all the language difficulties people have (you also get a good lesson in olde English).  Everyone should have a copy of this modern day bible.<br />The translation is perfect for the younger Christian and older Christian alike, its important that the bible moves with the times, and as it has been translated into thousands of languages already its only fair it gets translated into modern day English.<br />A well deserved 5 Stars.<br />5 Stars.	2003-08-21

Before buying the books I was big fan of the Sharpe movies on TV, I used to love watching them and am glad to say upon finding the series of books my opinion of Sharpe has raised many times over.<br />This book is set the peninsular wars.  Sharpe has not yet met Harper (there is a small section about harpers experiences though) and he is not enjoying his life as a commissioned officer in his majesty's army.  This book gives Sharpe just the kind of adventure he needs to get his morale up for the books that follow.<br />This book isn't my favourite of the whole Sharpe series but it is the most sentimental to me, Bernard Cornwell is a great author/historian.  You don't just get a great story but you get an in-depth history lesson also.  Though Sharpe is a fictional character the scenarios in which he is placed are not, so you get a feel for what soldiers and people alike lived through and experienced.  <br />Of all the Sharpe books this is up there with the best, I give this book a well deserved 4 stars (it'd be five but they are reserved for Sharpe's Tiger).	2003-08-21

Andy McNab is an extraordinary guy.  He failed high school, almost got in trouble with the law, joined the army, became a member of the world's most elite special forces and ended up becoming a best selling author.  This is his life story.<br />The book fills in everything Bravo Two Zero left out about this guy.  What motivated him to join the army?  Why did he want to join the SAS?  What does life in the SAS involve?  The book answers all these questions and more.  <br />The best selling author of Bravo Two Zero has led an interesting life, its good for all us people who wouldn't know what to do in any kind of situation where we got guys shooting at us to dream of being a hero, this guy has done it.<br />This is a great book, 5 Stars.	2003-08-21

I was very disappointed by the quality of it, soon after reading the first few verses the pages started coming away from the body of the book. <br />A bible is a bible, the words mean the same thing regardless of the publisher but with this book I was really disappointed by the quality of it, I went right out and bought a hard backed copy, its worth the extra couple of bucks.<br />I only give this bible 1 star, the words deserve alot more respect then to be placed book that falls apart after reading just a few pages.	2003-08-21

It takes a while to get into this book, but when you do its worth it.  Its a real page turner (and there's alot of them), its several stories that all come together to one great ending.  <br />The book reflects the constant danger we are in from terrorist attack, in this case the threat of a nuclear detonation in a major city.  Terrorists come up with a plan to start the Third World War and its upto Jack Ryan, CIA, to stop them. What unfolds is a great story that makes you think 'what if'. <br />Having not read a Tom Clancy book before I didn't quite know what to expect.  While reading the book though I found myself amazed at the amount of technical details I had read without even thinking about it.  Am not one who likes to look at the specs of things but I was impressed by the way Clancy included these in the book without it dulling the readers interest, if anything it made the book more interesting.  This guy knows his stuff and when it comes to writing he has his style and it obviously works, many movies have been made from his books and he is still writing after many years.  <br />I found some of his newer books to be more difficult to get interested in but when it comes to the Jack Ryan series he has it made.<br />This book was turned into a highly successful film that I am yet to see, but if it is half as entertaining as the book i'll watch it a dozen times.  <br />4 Stars (would have been 5 but as I said, it was a little difficult to get interested in it to begin with).	2003-08-21

As one of many new authors recounting there experiences in the British Armys elite forces Spence has gone out of his way to give us 'Civvies' a taste of life in the SAS.  <br />Spence has a story to tell but he goes beyond that, he gives us an insight into the politics and dark humour that make the SAS so fascinating.  As well as describing the engagements they encountered while in Iraq, Spence also describes the effect these events had on himself and the rest of the unit. The main 'action' part of the book happens just past the mid way point, but the story continues with minor engagements, enough to keep any action junky reading till the end.  <br />This book isn't just about the SAS being the greatest force in the world, its about the people within this elite unit, the way they deal with the pressure they are under (often through humour and pulling pranks on each other) and how different there role is to the regular army divisions. <br />I gave this book 4 stars because it lacks a little in the action department and talks a little to much for my liking to make it a 5 star.  But its a fantastic book regardless.	2003-08-19

The book however is detailed and describes many aspects of SAS life.<br />By now most people have a general idea what happened to the patrol Bravo Two Zero, with the history channel specials and many more documentaries surrounding the ill-fated patrol.  The reason the book is so successful I believe is because it has everything that people want, although these people technically failed to do what they were in Iraq to do (through bad intelligence etc.) its still a story or heroism and survival against the odds.  Just the kind of story peoples everywhere Love. <br />Andy Mcnab's writing style is perfect for this kind of book, he doesn't try to put his story across like he is writing the Queens speech, he isn't in any way pretentious, he is what he is (and now a multi best selling author), A former SAS Trooper.<br />This was the first of many SAS books I read but still remains the best.  5 Stars.	2003-08-19

Both books are a tale of survival, all be it in different ways.  <br />Chris Ryan sure has a good story to tell, he was the only member of the Bravo Two Zero patrol to escape Iraq.  He evaded capture for many days on very little food or water.  He battled fatigue, extreme weather and many many Iraqis.  He also battled himself, he didn't let his body give in while his mind was still working, he fought for every step and his story is truly one of courage and self determination.<br />The book does focus alot on Ryan's own 'heroism', he obviously feels he should have been the commander of the patrol and expresses this many times through the book, in the end this gets a bit tired and old.  He seems to think that the problems the patrol encountered would have been just fine if he was in command, it seems a bit pretentious as it continues. <br />There are alot of inconsistencies between the books and it is upto the reader who he should choose to believe.  I personally think this book was written to ride on the success of the first book by raising questions that will never be answered.<br />However it is a must read for any one with an interest in the SAS,  2 Stars	2003-08-19
