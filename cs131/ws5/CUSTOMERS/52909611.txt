His writing not only is in good English, but it's good writing! The story takes place in the spring of 1989, in China. Obviously, the reader is in a state of mounting suspense awaiting the eyewitness description of the massacres at Tiananmen Square which occurred on June 3-4. Ha Jin writes of these and of everyday things--food preparation, clothing styles, ancient poems, songs, and political events, as only a native Chinese could. His narrator, a graduate student at a provincial university, experiences the horrors of tending a deranged stroke patient--his professor and mentor--and hears the recollections the older man dredges up about the Cultural Revolution, a time of book-burning, persecution, and debasement of all intellectuals by the regime. There are also several side plots involving romance and political advancement at the expense of merit, a crude form of cronyism with which we are familiar in our own country.<br /><br />Ha Jin has managed to write in a style that reads as though it is a translation from Chinese to English, but obviously he wrote the book in English. A thoroughly impressive effort.	2005-10-11

Set in 1942-43, it is the diary of a young man waiting to be drafted (Bellow himself was deferred so long that eventually he joined the Merchant Marine). Although the self-centered story of Joseph waiting for his draft call becomes annoying at times--it brings to mind the criticism made about James Joyce's \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\" namely that it focuses too intently on the author gazing into a mirror in unblinking self-regard--Bellow manages to insert some wonderful lyric passages into the diary form of the story. <br />   <br />For someone of my age (71) it's especially nostalgic to read the contemporary references to the World War II era: \\"both doors of the phonograph were open;\\" the songs \\"Mr. Five-by-five\\" and \\"Chattanooga Choo-Choo;\\" rationing of leather goods, sugar, coffee, gasoline, and butter; hoarding; the conga; baking days and washing days; the navy transport plane called the Catalina; a blacked out street lamp bent over a curb on a rainy night; war mothers knitting mufflers; \\"Your Hit Parade;\\" doors shut with pneumatic arms; pants in the new style saving cloth, without cuffs; Bataan.  <br />  <br />Bellow cites other telling details that resonated with me personally: \\"I was forever buying books...As long as they surrounded me they stood as guarantors of an extended life...\\" \\"I fell back into bed and spent an hour or so...watching the dark beams from the slats of the blind wheeling on the upper wall.\\" <br /> <br />Bellow's protagonist is a \\"reflective man\\" who suffers from a feeling of strangeness, who seeks to know who he is. Like his literary successor, Augie March, he is fenced around, less than a whole man. He holds lengthy internal debates with his Other whom he calls \\"But on the Other Hand, Tu As Raison Aussi.\\" <br /> <br />Yet he can appreciate the majesty of nature: \\"The clouds were sheared back from a mass of stars chattering in the hemispheric blackness--the universe, this windy midnight, out on its eternal business.\\" <br /> <br />The author's magnificent ability with words stops the reader cold: \\"For every need there is an entrepreneur, by a marvelous providence. You can find a man to bury your dog, rub your back, teach you Swahili, read your horoscope, murder your competitor.\\" <br /> <br />There is a great deal of autobiographical reference in this work: Bellow actually grew up on St. Dominique Street in Montreal, mentioned in the text; in Chicago he lived near Humboldt Park, also referred to. Though the story is short on plot--a drunken party, a fight, a long period of waiting and privation, a stressed marriage--his writing can reach inside the reader's gut, as in his description of the pleasure he took in shining shoes as a child (in my case it was polishing coins): \\"the stove shone on the davenport and on the oilcloth and on my forehead, drawing the skin pleasantly. I did not clean shoes because I was praised for it, but because of the work and the sensations of the room, closed off from the wet and the fog of the street, with its locked shutters and the faint green of the metal pipes along the copings of its houses.\\" In fact, his descriptions of the slum inhabited by Joseph have a strongly Dickensian ring: \\"chimneys pointed heavenward in openmouthed exhaustion...houses, their doors and windows open, drawing in the freshness, were like old drunkards of consumptives taking a cure....[T[he smeary blind eyes of windows...in hope of an impossible rejuvenation.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Dangling Man\\" is an underappreciated, under read marvel. <br />	2005-10-08

Bellow's fluid--and often florid--inner consciousness writing contains echoes of Walt Whitman, of learning pounded into students of the Old Testament, and of Greek myth. Best of all, his early chapters bring to life 1920s Chicago, the Jewish tenements, the old world condescension and superior attitude of Augie's grandmother, and of life on the streets, just as the film \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\" does for Robert De Niro's Bronx character, \\"Noodles.\\" I marked any number of passages and lines that struck me as superior, too many to quote.<br /><br />Where the novel goes astray, I believe, is in the episodes set in Mexico (with Thea and her eagle) and in France. The story comes alive only in the Chicago of Augie's inner life, with companions such as Dingbat, Augie's employer, the paraplegic father-figure Einhorn, the gangsters, gamblers and cheats, of his strange relationship with his brothers, the fortune-hunting Simon and the imbecile Georgie, and of his women, Lucy Magnus, Thea, and his wife, Stella.<br /><br />Bellow used enough real events, such as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 and the GM sit-down strike of 1937, to hold the attention of anyone interested in history, but he personalizes these events with poignant episodes of home life and the hard times his character survived. There is enough autobiographical detail in the novel to fill out the reader's impression of early Bellow, and if that isn't enough, his earlier work, \\"Dangling Man,\\" completes the task.<br /><br />There was a time when \\"page-turner\\" meant a boring book, one that the reader skims through. Nowadays it means a gripping read. This novel is a definite page-turner of the latter type. Augie constantly searches for meaning in his life, for strength of character he feels he lacks, and for something better than the \\"reality\\" we know about. As he has Thea say, \\"There must be something better than what people call reality.\\"<br /><br />Although I haven't yet read the later Bellow novels, it seemed to me as I put this one down that he began a philosophical search with this early book, and that he probably never completed the journey. I intend to follow him on his way.han what people call reality.\\"  <br /> <br />Although I haven't yet read the later Bellow novels, it seemed to me as I put this one down that he began a philosophical search with this early book, and that he probably never completed the journey.

US	52909611	R5XXDRAW3LU12	1594200637	246291978	On Beauty	Books	4	17	26	N	N	A good try.	Zadie Smith is a good writer, although a somewhat sloppy writer. She makes mistakes (\\"obverse directions\\" should read \\"opposite directions\\"), and sometimes she shows signs of haste or of a tin ear (\\"slanted sails blowing about on perforated seas,\\" referring to textual oddities). She can also be very funny (describing a theory of \\"women's punctuation\\" for example, or using the phrase, \\"Umbrellas, like dead birds after a shooting party, pile up in the far corner\\"), and can be both funny and accurate (\\"Howard could not piss next to people he knew\\").  <br /> <br /> In this novel she tells a fine story, or rather a series of stories, and to my mind has captured the dilemma of mixed race families perfectly. She can bring the reader's emotions up in her description of a death of a friend, or a character's gut reaction to hearing music sung, or the tenuous, anguished life on a non-tenured professor. And she does a real number on Ivy League colleges. Where I lose her is in the area of \\"Beauty.\\" What is it and who can describe it?  There is much discussion of Rembrandt and of the depth of his vision, but Rembrandt also created some obscene etchings that were lodged almost out of sight high on the walls of the Norton Simon Museum when I first saw them. <br /> <br /> My enjoyment of the book was enhanced by Smith's occasional ear-perfect perceptions, like this one: \\"[People] continuing with these banal little English catchphrases that never failed to drive Howard up the bleeding wall. His childhood had been shot through with this meaningless noise, just so many substitutes for real conversation. Brass monkeys out there. Don't mind if I do. I don't fancy yours much. And on. And on.\\" A good read. <br />	2005-10-07
US	52909611	R1FC8902ZSFB7P	0140438270	768576807	The Vicar of Bullhampton (Trollope, Penguin)	Books	5	25	25	N	N	Insightful, realistic, a pleasure to read	<br /> Other reviewers have discussed the plot and the characters of this wonderful mid-Victorian novel; I would rather speculate about what makes the author so much a favorite of mine. Trollope led a jumbling life, traveling constantly during his career as a postal inspector in Ireland, and throughout the world thereafter. He started life as a poor boy suffering hazing at a rich boy's school, was defeated later in a run for Parliament, and ended up a loud, red-faced, hale fellow at clubs. But something developed in his character that gave him remarkable insight into both the upper and lower class mental sets of the English mind of that period. The result is that he can marvelously reproduce both the speech and the thought patterns of his men and women characters as they wrestle with problems they encounter in everyday ethical situations, both ordinary and extraordinary. Thus, we are presented with the dilemmas of a puzzled betrothed young woman, a \\"fallen\\" woman, a youth suspected of murder, an old man torn by grief, a man in the throes of unrequited love, and a fight between a country parson and a lord. Everything is explained and I found myself murmuring, \\"Of course. They would think that, say that, do that.\\" Unlike Dickens, he doesn't deal in grotesques. Unlike Thackeray, he doesn't mock his creations. The novel is therefore a perfect example of the Realist school of fiction writing as well as a fine read. It doesn't cut as deeply as \\"The Way We Live Now,\\" which could be a treatise on the \\"greed is good\\" generations of our recent past, nor does it have the spellbinding comedy-tragedy of the Barsetshire series, nor the political intricacies of the Palliser Series of his novels, but Trollope doesn't disappoint the attentive reader who will suspend \\"presentism\\" type judgments about the role of women or the church in the 19th century or the fact that defendants in a criminal trial could not testify. That was then. He still speaks to us now, and speaks quite clearly. <br /> <br />	2005-08-29

The story of a rags-to-riches advertising fraud sounds quite the contemporary tone. Edward Ponderevo runs a chemist's shop in the Victorian equivalent of Vic and Sade's Dismal Seepage, Ohio. The idea strikes him to add coloring and flavor to a bottle of junk and market it as a miracle drug, Tono-Bungay. Before long, other quacks jump onto his bandwagon and he rises in society and prestige. Part of Wells' genius lay in foreseeing the future: he has the narrator, poor, \\"ruined\\" George, go out on a leaky sailing vessel to west Africa in search of radioactive \\"quap,\\" some stuff that will turn the world on its head, as indeed uranium did, later. He even describes this \\"quap\\" as deriving from pitchblende, as uranium does! He also plays with aeronautical inventions such as gliders and balloons, and our anti-hero ends up designing destroyers for the Royal Navy. The love interest, Beatrice (pace, Dante), is unattainable, not because of the usual Victorian claptrap about class or modesty, but because she's addicted to \\"chloral,\\" the hypnotic element of knockout drops, chloral hydrate. Some of the love interest may have arisen from Wells' romance with Rebecca West, quite a looker in her younger days; (their affair produced a son, Anthony West, who became an embittered old man hating both his parents).<br /><br /> Wells wrote some great stories: \\"The Shape of Things to Come,\\" which predicted air warfare although it appeared in 1899, \\"The War of the Worlds,\\" and my favorite, \\"The Man Who Could Work Miracles,\\" filmed in 1935 with Roland Young (\\"Topper\\") as the innocent barfly who stops time. \\"Tono-Bungay\\" is among his finest.<br /><br /> Wells had no use for \\"the quality,\\" that is, the idle rich who populated England's country houses in the 19th century. \\"The great houses stand in their parks still, the cottages cluster respectfully on their borders, touching their eaves with their creepers...\\" At tea, the great lady \\"acknowledged your poor tinkle of utterance with a voluminous, scornful 'Haw!' that made you want to burn her alive.\\" She had \\"a small set of stereotyped remarks that constituted her entire mental range.\\" The narrator sat uneasily on a hard chair \\"trying to exist, like a feeble seedling amidst great rocks.\\" The house had a \\"great staircase that has never been properly descended since powder went out of fashion.\\" When later he went to live at the home of young Beatrice and invited to play with her, he was \\"handed over as if I was some large variety of kitten.\\"<br /><br /> George grew up in the 1880s, the era of \\"The Good Hard-Working Man.\\" A point of honor \\"was to rise at or before dawn, and then laboriously muddle about.\\" Religion was dispensed in a dingy chapel, \\"a little brick-built chapel equipped with a spavined roarer of a harmonium.\\" The larger church, \\"the great pre-Reformation church, [was] a fine grey shell, like some empty skull from which the life has fled.\\"<br /><br /> Uncle Edward is the finest character in the novel: a little fat, (\\"he'd look lovely with a stopper,\\" chides his wife, who calls him \\"Old Sossidge\\"), breathing with audible \\"Zzzzzz\\" sounds, he could be found lying on a small wooden fold-up bed, wearing \\"an elderly but still cheerful pair of check pajamas.\\" His contribution to the world was to be thinking up slogans and fancy adverts for his fake products. The \\"proper\\" shops of his day \\"had been but lightly touched by the American's profaning hand,\\" and they did not cater to people \\"who in a once fashionable phrase, do not 'exist.'\\" He would change all that. He raised capital by going to each source in turn and saying the others had come in. Then he conquered England \\"province by province. Like sogers.\\" \\"'You can GO for twenty-four hours,' we declared, 'on Tono-Bungay chocolate.' We didn't say whether you could return on the same commodity.\\" His lovable, eccentric wife, Susan, is plain as salt. \\"Shedescribed the knights of the age of chivalry as 'kavorting about on the off-chance of a dragon.'\\" She offers her nephew a biscuit: \\"Have some squashed flies, George.\\"<br /><br /> The narrator believes himself to be a \\"morally limited cad with a mind beyond his merits.\\" He suffers through a long, horrible marriage and separation, and shares in the Tono-Bungay business. His uncle, meanwhile, discovers creative accounting 19th century style: \\"you wouldn't find the early figures so much wrong as strained.\\" He also discovers what auditors call \\"y/e\\" items, year-end transactions. \\"Each of these companies ended its financial year solvent by selling great holdings of shares to one or other of its sisters, and paying a dividend out of the proceeds...\\" Nothing has changed in a century. Wells has his narrator comment, \\"I had some amazing perceptions of just how modern thought and the supply of fact to the general mind may be controlled by money.\\" At the same time he notices the London unemployed, \\"a shambling, shameful stream they made, oozing along the street, the gutter waste of competitive civilisation.\\" Unlike his uncle, they had not said \\"Snap\\" in the right place, or were too eager, or never said it at all. Uncle Edward develops a rich man's style of behavior, he would \\"Zzzzz\\" and fiddle with his glasses, and \\"rise slowly to his toes as a sentence unwound, jerkily like a clockwork snake, and drop back on his heels at the end.\\" He was no longer a little man.

She plumbs the depths of her characters' emotional lives and finds beautiful expressive language at the same time. In the first story in this collection, \\"Runaway,\\" a surprise ending shows how a husband can wreak revenge on his abused wife when she returns after leaving him unexpectedly.<br /><br /> In the first of my favorite set of stories, \\"Chance,\\" Juliet, a young Classics teacher leading a stunted life in Ontario, takes a fateful train ride and encounters a man from B.C. whose wife is dying; she later starts an unorthodox relationship with him but learns he already has a woman, Christa. (Many of Munro's characters are teachers or scholars.) \\"In the town where she grew up her sort of intelligence was often put in the same category as a limp or an extra thumb, and people had been quick to point out the expected accompanying drawbacks--her inability to run a sewing machine or tie up a neat parcel, or notice that her slip was showing. What would become of her, was the question.\\" In a store, a woman says, \\"So that's the girl who talks Latin.\\"<br /><br /> The story is continued in \\"Soon,\\" which concerns Juliet's trip home with her baby daughter, Penelope. It is 1969. She takes leave of Christa, who has become her friend. When they get there, Juliet finds her mother dying of heart trouble and her father tied down by manual labor after being fired as a teacher for being too outspoken. The story ends in \\"Silence,\\" with time speeded up. Penelope, first adolescent and then grown, disappears from her mother's life without explanation, and Juliet's live-in companion, Eric, drowns; Christa becomes her best friend but then falls ill. Munro explores both the heartaches and the walling-in of emotions these events cause, and how Juliet continues through the years remaining to her.<br /><br /> The remaining stories in the collection tell of an encounter between a woman and a sexy alcoholic, a trip up a country road to scatter someone's ashes, two Shakespearean parodies about mix-up of twins, and the life-stream of a woman who marries the wrong man and whose friend has powers of second sight about the right one. Several stories contain women characters who seem hard and rigid and disapproving, but always for an inner reason, a burden of pain.<br /><br /> Munro almost literally has her finger on the pulse of people's hearts. For that reason alone, I can't do justice to her work.

De Foe, orphaned at the age of eight, and his Uncle Edward are guards at the Glace Museum in Halifax, Nova Scotia,and the time is 1938. Refugees are beginning to stream out of Europe ahead of Hitler's Panzer divisions and Luftwaffe. The first half of the novel is faintly comic and concerns itself with the details of the jobs the two men have, and a ton of unnecessarily detailed back story. Uncle Edward is a piece of work. The second half of the novel centers on De Foe's girl friend, Imogen, who becomes obsessed with one of the paintings at the museum, entitled \\"Jewess On a Street In Amsterdam.\\" She then becomes obsessed with the artist who painted it, and believes she is his wife. Things go on from there. I would describe the story as a tale of a woman suffering from severe melancholia and delusions, as well as listless affect on the part of the two protagonists, coupled with the onset of mania in Imogen, but I'm not a psychologist. <br /> <br />I found the writing turgid and the book a page turner in the old sense: boring. Much of the latter portion of the novel is in epistolary form, and I can well understand why that form died out after the 18th century. It's merely a lot of tell instead of show and it carries no emotional freight for the characters <br />	2005-03-05

New York: Pantheon Books, 1988. <br /> <br /> \\"Write about what you know\\" has never been a better-applied axiom than here. The author's descriptions of 1860s Sicily following Garibaldi's coup against the Bourbon regime, is a masterpiece of intricate detail and plotting. Added to this delightful \\"new world\\" he presents to the reader, are the characters: the proud prince of the title, now gradually reduced to suffer falling fortunes because of the regime change, the clever and humane Jesuit priest, Father Pirrone, who has become a household companion to Don Fabrizio, the swashbuckling Tancredi, the prince's haughty \\"Republican\\" nephew, and his betrothed, Angelica, the new mayor's beautiful daughter. Lampedusa's deep insight into the manners and psychology of the era make the novel a splendid and eye-opening read. The desolation and poverty of dusty, rocky Sicily overrun by invaders five times, is portrayed realistically, as are the emotional tensions within and between the characters. <br /> <br /> Even in Archibald Carquhoun's stiff translation, the work comes alive. The constricted world of jealous citizens, royal or poverty-stricken, takes on a very modern appearance. Illiterate they may be, but even the poorest peasants demonstrate a slickness of thinking and behavior that would make Machiavelli proud. As for the sensitive Leopard, aware of his downward spiral into a lonely life in a ruined castle, we can only empathize. <br /> <br /> And there is soft humor: \\"Even the Magdalen between the two windows looked penitent and not just a handsome blonde in some dubious daydream, as she usually was.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"The two telescopes and three lenses were lying there quietly, dazed by the sun, with black pads over their eyepieces, like well-trained animals who knew their meal was given to them only at night.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Grim Palermo itself lay crouching quietly around its contents like a flock of sheep around their shepherds.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Love. Of course, love. Flames for a year, ashes for thirty.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Peaches with a faint flush of rosy pink on their cheeks, like those of Chinese girls.\\" <br /> \\"'D'you remember, Papa, how...he took those peaches we'd so been looking forward to?' Then she suddenly looked dour, as if she were the chairwoman of an association for owners of damaged orchards.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"They plunged at once into the skirmish of insignificant words which precede great verbal battles.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"The horseshoes sounded muffled amid the dark houses, asleep or pretending to sleep.\\"  <br /> <br /> That the author himself was a prince, writing about his great-grandfather, lends authenticity to the novel, but the fact that he died a few months after finishing it is uncanny, because the death of Don Fabrizio at 73 is described with such candor and brilliance and lack of emotionality (\\"the exit sign is nearby\\"), that the reader is amazed. Did Lampedusa foretell his own end? Do the waters of life really seem to trickle, then rush, then pour out of our body in a torrent? And what are we to make of his observation that none of us would want to enter heaven wearing the faces we die with?  <br /> A true masterpiece. <br />	2004-11-02

I'm always impressed with his playful and total command of English, slang and all. This novel, about a chess genius, is one of his earliest. I'll happily turn to all the rest, having previously read only \\"Lolita\\" and \\"Pnin.\\" <br /> <br /> Luzhin, the hapless grandmaster born before World War I, has no inner life. He hides from people on all social occasions, dresses in rags, and lives a reclusive existence until an unnamed Russian expatriate in Paris takes pity on him and marries him over her parents' objections. The modern reader naturally thinks of Bobby Fischer with his antisocial behavior and tantrums, but Luzhin is more tortured, and actually has a psychotic break at the point of adjournment of his world championship match with an Italian challenger who favored hypermodern flank openings (perhaps modeled after Richard Reti, another player of the 1920s whose achievements were cut short by an early death). <br /> <br /> Nabokov not only played chess, but composed \\"retrograde\\" problems of the most difficult kind, in which the solution requires proof of the move that must have preceded the position shown in the diagram. His description of Luzhin's hallucinations is harrowing, but his shimmering vocabulary and sentence structure puts him at the top of his craft as a writer. One of the most remarkable things about Nabokov was his brilliant, penetrating, power of observation. A few examples:  <br /> <br /> \\"That special snow of oblivion, abundant and soundless snow, covered his recollection with an opaque white mist.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"...and his wife's voice persuading the silence to drink a cup of cocoa.\\"   <br />  <br /> \\"He became engrossed in the fantastical misbehavior of numbers and the wayward frolics of geometric lines....He lingered long in those heavens where earthly lines go out of their mind.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"[Chess] combinations [are] like melodies. You know, I simply hear the moves.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"The urns that stood on the stone pedestals at the four corners of the terrace threatened one another across their diagonals.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"Maples were casting their lively shade.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"The typewriter, whose keys were all watching him with their pupils of reflected light...\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"A half-opened drawer from which, snake-like, a green red-spotted tie came crawling.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"The modern urge to set senseless records...\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"Not once did he attempt to support a collapsing conversation.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"He looked at the moon, which was tremblingly disengaging itself from some black foliage.\\"  <br />  <br /> \\"A village girl was eating an apple and her black shadow on the fence was eating a slightly larger apple.\\" <br />  <br /> [Champagne bottle] \\"A bucket with a gold-knobbed glass Pawn sticking out of it.\\" <br />  <br /> \\"The tailor jabbed pins into him, which he took with astonishing deftness from his mouth, where they seemed to grow naturally.\\" <br />  <br /> \\"A burst of military music approached in orange waves.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"A bookcase crowned with a broad-shouldered, sharp-faced Dante in a bathing cap.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"A candle whose flame darted about, maddened at being carried out of the warm church into the unknown darkness, and finally died of a heart attack at the corner of the street where a gust of wind bore down from the Neva.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Chairs moved with the sounds of throats being cleared. <br /> <br /> \\"[As the cab moved] the soft shadow made by his nose circled slowly over his cheek and then his lip, and again it was dark until another light went by.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"In the entrance hall hung a condemned jacket.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Attendants were accepting things and carrying them away like sleeping children.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"Someone closed the door so the music would not catch cold.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"The helpless mercury, under the influence of its surroundings, fell ever lower and lower.\\" <br /> <br /> \\"The bedroom was adorned by a bas-relief done in charcoal and a confidential conversation  <br /> between a cone and a pyramid.\\" <br />  <br /> \\"The most unexpected places were invaded in the mornings by the snout of the rapacious vacuum cleaner. It is difficult, difficult to hide a thing: the other things are jealous and do not allow a homeless object escaping pursuit, into a single cranny.\\" <br /> <br />An amazing masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-11-02

The idea is well-intentioned but the book doesn't fit the bill.      As an admirer of Lincoln I found the book trite, the writing commonplace, oratorical: \\"We yearn for a vision worthy of the world's greatest nation.\\" The put-downs of Bush are the best part, but there's nothing new about them. Cuomo tries to make Lincoln a New Dealer, in fact. He says that Lincoln believed that we have the obligation \\"to try to achieve human betterment by helping one another through sharing.\\" He credits Lincoln for recognizing two basic principles of natural law: the obligation to recognize equal entitlement for all persons, and the necessity of working together. I have to accept these generalized statements because the author quotes many of Lincoln's speeches and writings that demonstrate their accuracy, but how do they solve any of the problems we face now, of a militant Christian crusade, a fanatical, arrogant, bellicose president bent on unilateralism and constant war, a toady to the rich and his big contributors, a destroyer of the environment and suppressor of dissent? You don't have to go back to Lincoln to see the effects of a bad administration; Harding, Coolidge and Hoover are close to us enough.      On Lincoln's birthday in 1998, Newt Gingrich said that \\"any student of Lincoln would conclude that America must bomb Iraq.\\" This exploitation of Lincoln for political purposes, and in fact the Bush crowd's exploitation of FDR and Harry Truman for Republican propaganda purposes, is vile. Cuomo is right to excoriate it, and also to deplore the \\"flamboyant showmanship\\" and lack of dignity of Bush's landing on the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to declare victory in Iraq just ahead of the deaths of a thousand American troops in that quagmire.     Lincoln desired inclusion, not exclusion. That's why we fought the Civil War. He was blessed with many character traits lacking in Bush: integrity, intellectuality, lucidity, subtlety, common sense, reasonableness, and the capacity to inspire the moral rise of the country. It's odd that this man, who had less than a year of formal education, saw things more clearly than \\"our first MBA president.\\"     It's when Cuomo gets into subjects such as our trade deficit, consumer debt, the issue of \\"corporate welfare,\\" the Kyoto Protocol, and \\"faith-based\\" policies, that he leaves Lincoln far behind and tells us more about his own beliefs than those of his subject. And he gets into quite a bind attempting to explain away Lincoln's suspension of civil rights during the war, his odd concept of religion [although it was enlightening to learn that Gen. Grant issued an order banning Jews from territory under his control, and Lincoln reversed the order], and his early court defense of a slave-owner. His desire to appoint Supreme Court justices who agreed with his policies sounds strangely familiar, too.     I read the book for the same reasons that Cuomo probably had for writing it: an admiration of Lincoln and a disdain for moral midgets like Bush. But it's not really a book at all. It's a 200-page homily. The dictionary defines homily as a sermon on a moral theme, sometimes including platitudes. I did appreciate the numerous quotations showing Lincoln's beautiful use of language. He must have been one hell of a trial lawyer.	2004-09-07

I thought I was pretty savvy on American history and politics, and economics too, but...the logic of the author's argument is irrefutable. We are spending ourselves blind on military weaponry and bases (in 153 countries), constantly expanding our \\"defensive\\" (read offensive) capacity, and blindly letting the Bush gang destroy our Constitution. We are allowing lies and disinformation make us cynical about government. We are looking for war. We teach state terrorism to foreigners. We violate treaties. We provoke attack. We oppress friendly nations. We are installing puppet governments. We have private armies. The war profiteers, linked to government, continue to fatten on the sales of arms. The WTO and IMF, which operate out of Washington DC are crippling Third World countries, dumping on them, restricting their development, controlling their governments, favoring dictatorships, bankrupting them in the name of \\"globalization.\\" The media in our own country is controlled. Our Congress is ineffectual. Secret courts allow civil rights violations to go unchecked. We have bases that are secret, listening posts that are secret, government budgets that are secret. Next we'll have secret satellites designed to destroy other countries' satellites. <br /> <br />It isn't all about oil and it isn't all about terrorism. It's about American imperialism and an out of control military. We are attempting to control all of Central Asia. We dominate space. Empires survive by aggression and expansion before they crumble and fall. America is an empire. I'm convinced that this author has got it right, and it's scary as anything I've ever read.	2004-09-02

New York: Carroll & Graf, 2001. <br /> Lincoln's career as a lawyer was a strange mixture. For 23 years he handled cases both large and small, for fees ranging from nothing to $5,000. The author takes inconsistent positions, now claiming that Lincoln had no use for law books and that he practiced at a place and time when precedents were few, and gave little preparation to his cases. But then he complete reverses himself and says that Lincoln studied precedents closely, that he argued 178 cases before the Illinois Supreme Court, ranging from a $3 hog case to one involving a third of a million dollars in taxes, and that his cases included conditional sales, fraudulent conveyance, surety, conflicting liens, false imprisonment, jurisdiction, equity of redemption, set-offs, seduction, wagering, slander, recording, land improvement, licenses, trusts, slavery, patent, mandamus, usury, ejectment, out-of-state depositions, trespass on the case, foreclosure, rescission, assumpsit, writ practice, liquor licenses, reapportionment, admiralty, land accretion, minor's contracts, homicide, and important railroad cases involving eminent domain issues, as well as cases involving constitutional questions such as interstate commerce. In addition to railroad corporations, Lincoln represented municipalities, banks, gas companies, insurance companies and large manufacturing and commercial concerns. He litigated stockholders rights and corporate charter provisions. He never refused to represent \\"soulless corporations\\" and often tried merely to hold down the amount of damages, as any defense lawyer would. Naturally, he could not do this complex work operating solely by the seat of his pants.  <br /> Obviously, the man was unique for his day and definitely was not a hayseed lawyer, though he gave the appearance of one by wearing trousers that ended two inches above his shoes. Contrary to what the author tells us, quoting Lincoln's long-term partner, William Herndon, (p. 242) that \\"Practically he knew nothing about the rules of evidence, of pleading, or practice, as laid down in the textbooks, and seemed to care nothing about them,\\" Lincoln knew his pleas in abatement and in bar, his demurrers, claims of laches, joinder issues, and his appellate bond rules. The parts I like best about him are the events that I can relate to myself: his standing in the Bar for integrity and honesty, the fact that he related to jurors on a personal basis and was unassuming, his refusal to befog, and that he never stood on technicalities but was concise and kept the case simple and direct. There is a \\"Vic and Sade\\" quality to Lincoln's downstate Illinois experience (one of his associates was named U. L. Loop), which took me right back to early childhood and my radio days. I learned that Lincoln opposed the Mexican War as preemptive, unconstitutional, and a sneaky way for slavery to be extended west of the Mississippi. I felt his agony at seeing a losing case slip away, and his loss of enthusiasm for it. As a trial lawyer he was a ham (making a plug serve as a button when one fell off his coat; allowing a broken suspender to hang from his shoulder during closing argument), and was accused of switching almanacs in the famous \\"moonlight\\" murder case, which he did not do. The author quotes the famous \\"bleeding feet\\" closing argument in the case of the Revolutionary war veteran's widow seeking her pension. \\"He possessed the necessary attributes of a good jury lawyer: a strong personality, a readiness of wit and invention, and a strong dramatic sense.\\" <br /> I also liked the fact that he both trained young lawyers and acted as judge pro tem and arbitrator by request, two activities that I engaged in heavily. In this he was blessed with the rarest of all qualities of a great judge: he had an open mind. I also liked it that when he had finished saying what he had to say, he stopped, and sometimes said nothing at all. I did that once as a young lawyer, submitting a case without oral argument, and my client, who was present in court, almost fainted. We won. <br /> Lincoln fought the Dred Scott decision which declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820 to be unconstitutional, and which was followed by the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but he did not advocate ignoring it. I suppose his great weakness viewed from today's perspective was his grudging respect for the Constitutional approval of slavery and his belief that it remained the law of the land until amended. In this he was a lawyer's lawyer, looking past what was just to what was technically the law. <br /> The book discusses his debates with Stephen A. Douglas, and some of his legal actions as president (such as international law questions during the war). <br /> The book appears to me to be a collection of articles pasted together, with some inconsistencies and contradictions, but with plenty of interesting information and insights thrown in. I'm glad to see it back in print. <br />	2004-08-25

New York: The New Press, 2004. <br /> Subtitled, \\"A Journalist and His Times,\\" the book consists of a series of TV columns and speeches worked into essay form. All of it is worth reading, but the parts I liked best were the fiery defense of the Constitution, the unmasking of reactionary politicians as inhumane and proudly mean-spirited--\\"they narrowly defined membership in democracy to include only people like them\\"--and the comparison of today's politics with the struggles of the Progressives in the 1900-1920 era, after which FDR denounced \\"economic royalists\\" for what they were. Moyers' point is that the rich have no right to buy democracy. The politicians of terror \\"win only if we let them, only if we become like them: vengeful, imperious, intolerant, paranoid, invoking a God of wrath.\\" \\"Mencken got it right when he said, \\"Whenever you hear a man speak of his love for his country, it is a sign that he expects to be paid for it.\\" He denounces the consolidation of the media into a handful of plutocratic oligarchies. A statement that has stayed with me, because he repeated it during a book-signing in June 2004, was \\"No man is fit to be a master.\\" <br /> \\"The fight between the human scale and the giant scale--between the master and the governed--left unresolved by the Progressive Era, is returning for some kind of epic confrontation.\\" Today our liberties are threatened by the punishment of criticism and the distaste for variety or dissent. Our government is a study in bribery, conflicts of interest, corruption, and is awash in money from private interest groups. <br /> The media has turned to celebrity journalism, speed over accuracy, opinion over reporting, and this in turn is the result of concentrated ownership. (A panel of anchormen at the Democratic 2004 Convention admitted that they hadn't asked enough questions before validating the Bush move for war against Iraq.) \\"The job of telling the truth about people whose job it is to hide the truth is almost as complicated and difficult as trying to hide it in the first place.\\" A \\"deep and pervasive corruption has settled upon the republic.\\" Moyers calls this a \\"cynical age.\\"  <br /> The rest of the book relates episodes from Moyers' youth, a tribute to cultural literacy, liberal arts education, and contemplations about religion (he is an ordained minister). <br /> In sum, the book is an eloquent denunciation of the imperial state now in the hands of <br />          those with the Top Secret stamp all over government actions. It also includes a tribute to I.F. Stone, and a tip of the hat to poetry, which formed the basis for one of Moyers' PBS series. Describing an auto trip he made with his elderly father, he writes, \\"A later afternoon sun the size of a prospector's imagination was hanging in the sky as we drove out to their old farm.\\" A nice postscript. <br />	2004-08-25

New York: Putnam, 2003.<br /><br /> This book was a disappointment. Schieffer is basically a newspaper reporter, and his anecdotes about his long career with CBS-TV lie flat on the page. Aside from a few good quips, such as Dan Rather and Schieffer laughing over being described as \\"elitist\\" when they both attended small colleges in remote Texas towns, or Helen Thomas's retort to LBJ when he said that his answer to a question would be a very long one: \\"Then start at the end,\\" there isn't much that I didn't already know. Schieffer likes everyone: Nixon, Ford, Bush I, Bush II, and the defeated Democrats. But he hates Clinton because of his dishonesty and deception. This attitude tells me that (1) he's not very smart, (2) he is biased in favor of conservatives, and (3) he lacks judgment. This is precisely why I can't trust any of the talking heads on my TV screen. They're \\"analysis\\" of the news is superficial and gullible. The writing of the book is entertaining at times, more at the early (Vietnam) stages than the later, when his bitterness over the dismantling of CBS news shows through, but I missed the insights the author should have gotten over 40 years of journalistic work. His concerns were mainly for his career, and, if the book is to be believed, name-dropping and making contacts. His description of 9/11 and what has come afterward are naive and nothing new.	2004-08-25

New York: FSG, 2002. <br /> The topics covered by this uneven group of essays run from Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., to Larry Flynt and Jerry Falwell. Menand also has things to say about William James, T.S. Eliot, The New Yorker, Bill Paley of CBS, Pauline Kael, Christopher Lasch, Maya Lin, and \\"the mind of\\" Al Gore. Although I did a good deal of underlining--a lot of it trying to make sense of his comments about Christopher Lasch's philosophy against liberalism--there is something about Menand's conclusory style that is off-putting, as though his opinions are the only valid ones. For example, he claims that Justice Holmes \\"was utterly, sometimes fantastically, indifferent to the real-world effects of his decisions,\\" citing the infamous \\"stop-look-and-listen\\" ruling concerning automobiles at train intersections. I think there is plenty of evidence otherwise, and I'm reminded of the famous \\"yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater\\" opinion in Lochner v. U.S.  <br /> At his best, Menand can summarize a view in very few, well chosen words: \\"It is easy to appreciate [Maya Lin's] works as environmental installations....natural materials shaped in topological contours. It takes a little longer to see that they are also refinements on destruction...the Vietnam Memorial is made by repairing a large gash in the earth.\\" He also reminds us of things important to remember: that Al Gore wrote his senior thesis at Harvard on the impact of television on the presidency, concluding that \\"because television loves one face over many faces its effect has been to increase the president's political power at the expense of Congress's.\\" <br /> I had also forgotten that during the 1992 campaign Bush Number I \\"tried to make it seem that Clinton was a traitor because he had gone to Moscow as a student in1969.\\" This month marks the 50th anniversary of the famous statement by Joseph Welch in \\"Army vs McCarthy\\"--\\"Have you no decency, sir?\\" I remember it as a two-liner, the second being \\"Have you no sense of shame?\\" Clinton in Moscow was a campaign issue in 1992! <br /> The most startling conclusion reached by Menand is that Larry Flynt and Jerry Falwell really were on the same mission: to put the shame back into sex. The readers of Hustler Magazine also turn out to be members of Falwell's Moral Majority that claimed to have put Ronald Reagan into the White House. The chain of 7-Eleven stores sold 20% of all issues of Playboy, leading Menand to conclude that Falwell's TV audience of alienated lower class men was remarkably similar to the profile of the Hustler audience. When the Jim Bakker sex scandal brought him down during the anti-porn campaigns of the 80s, and 7-Eleven took Hustler and Playboy off its racks, it marked the demise of the culture of anything goes sexuality coincidental with the demise of the culture of televangelism. Mighty interesting.  <br /> Menand reviewed Eats, Shoots & Leaves in the New Yorker of 6/28/04, doing a carefully worded dismemberment of that sloppily written \\"punctuation text\\" written by a former sports columnist in caffeinated prose. He included an interesting digression about speaking versus writing: \\"The uncertainty about what it means for writing to have a voice arises from the metaphor itself. . . .As a medium, writing is a million times weaker than speech. . . .[C]hattiness, slanginess, in-your-face-ness, and any other features of writing that are conventionally characterized as \\"like speech\\" are usually the results of laborious experimentation, revision, calibration, walks around the block  unnecessary phone calls, and recalibration. . . .Writers are not mere copyists of language; they are polishers, embellishers, perfecters. . . .Does this mean that the written \\"voice\\" is never spontaneous and natural but always an artificial construction of language? This is not a proposition that most writers could accept. The act of writing is personal; it feels personal. . . . Composition is a troublesome, balky, sometimes sleep-depriving business. What makes it especially so is that the rate of production is beyond the writer's control. You have to wait, and what you are waiting for is something inside you to come up with the words. That something, for writers, is the voice. . . .What writers hear when they are trying to write is something more like singing than like speaking. Inside your head, you're yakking away to yourself all the time. Getting that voice down on paper is a depressing experience. When you write, you're trying to transpose what you're thinking into something that is less like an annoying drone and more like a piece of music. This writing voice is the voice that people are surprised not to encounter when they \\"meet the writer.\\" The writer is not so surprised.\\" . . .Some writers, when they begin a new piece, spend hours re-reading their old stuff, trying to remember how they did it, what it's supposed to sound like. This rarely works; nothing works reliably. . . . Sooner or later . . . the voice shows up, . . . and walks onstage.\\" <br />	2004-08-25

New York: Viking, 2004. <br /> Once again, the Lake Wobegon humorist shows us that he is better on the radio than he is on the page. His memories of childhood would have sounded much more genuine and moving if we could hear them in that low-pitched monotone, semi-mocking, that he uses on his show, which has been on the air for 30 years. <br /> The book appears to have been written in short segments and then sewn together disregarding repetitiousness. Thus, we learn many times that Keillor is 61, considers himself old, has had heart repair surgery, had a child in crisis rescued in minutes by the St. Paul EMT--much faster than the Republican, Minneapolis teams would respond (\\"when it comes to actually needing help from them, you shouldn't get your hopes up\\"), and so on.  <br /> It's when he compares Democrats to Republicans that his prose begins to spark. \\"[Republicans] are a party that is all about perceptions, the Christian party that conceals enormous glittering malice and is led by brilliant bandits who are dividing and conquering this sweet land I grew up in. I don't accept this.\\" The party of Lincoln has transmogrified into the party of \\"hairy-backed swamp developers and corporate shills, faith-based economists, see-through fundamentalist bullies with Bibles, Christians of convenience, freelance racists, hobby cops, misanthropic frat boys, . . . the shrieking midgets of AM radio,\\" and so on. He calls Bush an \\"Etch-a-Sketch president with a voice like a dial tone, . . . a dull and rigid man suspicious of the free flow of information and of secular institutions in general . . .\\" We are in the Gilded Age reincarnated, rallying to the cause of William McKinley. \\"The Republicans have turned into the Screw You Party.\\" \\"People with too much money and too little character, all sensibility and no sense, all nostalgia and no history.\\" <br /> Keillor sums up his philosophy in a single sentence. \\"I am a liberal and liberalism isthe politics of kindness.\\" He describes Democrats as people \\"who believe in decency and public spiritedness\\" and protection of the powerless, the party that upholds the generous spirit and respects the individual, the party that refuses \\"to hitch our wagon to yahooism and intolerance.\\" <br /> Keillor has changed since his earlier days. Instead of denigrating the humorless harshness of his Minnesota upbringing in a tiny Christian sect called the Plymouth Brethren, he reminds us that his parents' generation believed in helping their neighbors, in being of service and \\"accepting a rough road without complaining.\\" They had no need of barbiturates because they worked hard and were sleepy enough. <br /> I enjoyed the look back into the 40s, when students sat at little arm desks with inkwells and their report cards came home with marks in \\"deportment\\" for penmanship, obedience, cooperation, work habits, and citizenship, when we were taught to say \\"Please\\" and \\"Excuse me\\" and \\"May I.\\" I was glad to read that Keillor imitated Bob & Ray comedy routines and thought about space travel, that he practiced the art of invisibility and thought to himself, \\"Someday I won't have to do this\\" as he stood in gym shorts in a line of boys waiting to do a flying somersault. It was the library that saved both of us. He \\"entered into the stacks and there was pure heaven.\\" <br /> There is humor in the book. He served as the announcer for the college radio station, good training, until someone got up the courage to tell him that for lack of funding the station had gone off the air six months earlier. He danced with a classmate and, \\"we two being different heights, came out in 9/7 time.\\" He learned the art of the written essay, \\"a 440-yard dash through natural obstacles . . .meant to be esthetically elegant.\\" His first hangover gave him \\"a taste of what mental illness might be like, a sort of vacancy with dark shadows.\\" <br /> Keillor had a well-publicized hate-fest with Jesse Ventura, the wrestler turned governor of Minnesota, \\"whose first act in office was to sell the book rights.\\" After four years of him \\"it was a relief to go back to politics as usual, where soft-spoken people with ordinary chest sizes sit down and negotiate and get the job done.\\" <br /> Finally, he reminded me of my own visits to the South in the 1950s, with its segregated drinking fountains (a rusty pipe sticking out of a hole in the wall, draped with a sign reading \\"Colored\\"), and comments, \\"What exactly it is that the Republicans have done for the South other than wave the flag and the Bible, I don't quite fathom.\\" <br /> The second hundred pages of the book needn't have been written. It was all said in the first half. <br />	2004-08-25

This paperback novel comes with more than 20 blurbs on its covers and first pages. That made me suspicious. More than two dozen brand names are mentioned in the first couple of chapters. I guess that's part of the plot, but this reader was bewildered by those unfamiliar trademarks and all the hype. There's also one hell of a lot of description of clothing and interior decoration. It's quite a mixed bag.<BR> The author of several other novels, all set in the future, Gibson has put this one into the present, but a weird &quot;present&quot; consisting of Hotmail, domains, watermarked film footage, mysterious Russian spies, a female James Bond with a phobia for trademark logos, and lengthy e-mail messages that read as though they all were written by the same person. The heroine is drugged, assaulted, beaten, carted around blindfolded, and exposed to the strangest set of supporting players that could be imagined. In fact, they are far too strange for a novel. Gibson knows the Internet and a good deal of spook stuff--NSA, KGB, MI6, that sort of thing. But the novel lacks a life. I never did figure out why all the hocus-pocus. Only at the end can the protagonist, who lost her dearest and closest friend, her father, on 9/11, break down and cry. The writing is swift and sure, but the similes and metaphors are unpoetic, strained. Frankly, I'm glad it's over.	2004-02-16

Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill	Books	5	13	16	N	Y	A Fair and Balanced History	The surprises in this first book by a Bush II insider come unannounced: one is the long friendship between Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and their mutual concern over Bush's reckless economic policies. Another is Bush's sneering use of nicknames (\\"Balloonfoot\\" for Colin Powell, \\"Big O\\" for O'Neill). Paul O'Neill held the most important cabinet position next to State. For two years he attended one-on-one weekly meetings with the president, and attended meetings of the National Security Council. His meticulous record-keeping and John Dean-like near-perfect memory add to the persuasiveness of Suskind's fair and balanced presentation. The one suggestion I would have for readers unacquainted with the subject is to read up on macroeconomics. After all, Treasury is all about monetary and fiscal policy, economic trends, the current account deficit, and unemployment. We knew before this book came out about the controlling hand of Dick Cheney, hidden in a glove of silence; the overwhelming desire for secrecy inside the White House in an almost military \\"need to know\\" atmosphere; the demand that all administration hires be personally loyal to Bush and \\"stay on message\\"; and the slavish attention paid to big political contributors and corporate lobbyists. What O'Neill adds is the portrayal of Bush as virtually an empty suit lacking leadership qualities, a man who knows how to carry a grudge. O'Neill exposes the Iraq war for what it was: a neocon goal far earlier than 9/11. And he confirms what many readers have come to believe about the administration: that everything--everything, is political	2004-01-18

For the first 50 pages I took notice of his use of adjectives, quite innovative. The rest of the book, about a heartless, robotic man who &quot;becomes&quot; what he &quot;sees&quot; is nonsensical and cold. I knew what the ending would be, but held back my desire to skip to it and end the torture. Definitely not recommended for anyone who appreciates good literature or is looking for news on the human character or condition.	2003-10-10

Lefer lays her settings in a wide variety of  locales: Turkey, Manhattan, North Dakota, and various unidentified places  in &quot;The Heartland.&quot; Her characters are frequently perplexed.  Eileen, in &quot;Yasmin&quot; cannot find the political refugee she is  assigned to help. Midge, in &quot;Voluntaries,&quot; had a policeman son  who committed suicide. Ethan, an IRS agent in &quot;Mr. Norton's Wart  Hog,&quot; decides to take a bribe...next time. In &quot;Trompe  L'Oeil,&quot; Sheila decides to visit her mother as a hurricane approaches.  All of the stories are written so well that the reader believes the author  was really there. The stories are about relationships, from crazy mother  and daughter to crazy man and two women, to homemaker and homeless. They  are careful, thoughtful and compassionate. Lefer is not afraid to tell as  well as show, and she proves that it's the right thing to do a lot of the  time.	2000-08-19

The range of incident, humor, violence and dramatic confrontation  shown in these novellas were marks of Elkin's style. I especially recommend  &quot;The Bailbondsman,&quot; for in addition its odd twists the story has  depth and suspense and surprise. The narrator notices everything, even  &quot;the roller coaster&quot; of a man's fly when he sits. You have to be  ready to be shocked, but you will also find a whimsical streak in the  writing that delights. Elkin's final novel, &quot;Mrs. Ted Bliss,&quot;  might have been a continuation of &quot;The Condominium.&quot; Highly  recommended for all who appreciate fine writing or who are trying to write  on their own.	2000-08-19

It's decades ahead of the current mob of confessional autobiographies. I read it in almost one sitting. Not only does the author write gripping episodes, he writes them beautifully. I  noticed that on about a dozen occasions he slips from past to present  tense. Each time, it seems to be related to a dreamlike state, a  semiconscious state, a state of high emotion, or a state of intense action.  When I see that Conroy has edited &quot;Best&quot; stories from the Iowa  Review, I have to assume he really knows his stuff. Highly recommended.	2000-05-07

Having just finished reading &quot;A Sport and a Pastime&quot; I would say that Salter never gets around first base, whereas Zeidner hits  a home run. Layover, by Lisa Zeidner, is misleadingly described in the ads  as a spicy tale about a liberated woman who has a romp with every stranger  she encounters, as she runs a scam that gives her free hotel rooms. In  fact, it's the moving story of a terribly disturbed woman who has lost an  infant son in a car crash; her surgeon husband has admitted cheating on  her; and she has cracked. On the road in her sales job, she comes to a  complete halt, fails to go home or call, stops calling on customers, and  spends her time swimming in hotel pools without bothering to check in or  out. She seduces an 18-year old boy she meets in the pool, and then asks to  meet and have dinner with his mother. Her behavior becomes more and more  bizarre, and she knows it. She tracks down the boy's divorced father and  seduces him too. But there must come a resolution, and readers will find  the conclusion to this story unsurprising but satisfying. All through this  poetic, exquisitely written book, we sense the disintegration and confusion  the author provides this sassy, humorous, quick-minded but wounded and  dependent woman, as well as her anguish as she tries to work her way  through her life's major crisis. In the hands of any other author, it might  be a soap opera story, but Zeidner, a published poet, makes every word  count and every scene come to vivid life.	2000-01-08

Over the top, bizarre, deliberately flamboyant? No, just a different way of telling about emotional loss, incompleteness and yearning. The stories are fairy-tales,  folks.

Sarah, the protagonist, has had recurring nightmares in which she is holding her doll and stabbing it with a knife. The doll is bleeding. In  this episode, she sees an incident which explains her nightmares. Lessing  doesn't say it does, and Sarah doesn't say it does, but the reader knows it  because he/she has been shown it. The book is a masterpiece and a  heartbreaking scene tops it off. Don't know how she does it.	1999-08-05

Actually, it's a polemic of the revisionist history cadre and is as turgid as a prosecutor's brief.  The  author cheerfully acknowledges the good advice she was given by colleagues,  (and which she totally ignores):  (1) remain curious about the past rather  than judge it in the harsh light of' present-mindedness, and (2) conscience  and compassion are essential to the practice of history.  What we have is a  200 page diatribe against a popular magazine for shorting today's hot  buttons such as the ethnic groups so vocal these days, for not being  sufficiently anti-Communist during the McCarthy era, for not giving three  cheers when Jackie Robinson was hired by Branch Rickey (author: it also  failed to celebrate the fame and popularity of Rochester, Jack Benny's  chauffeur who was twice as funny and twice as smart as his boss), and in  general for being racist, class conscious and sexist.  Terrible.  How could  so many readers have taken out subscriptions?  Well, the author says the  subscribers and the readers of The New Yorker, as well as its advertisers,  its writers and its editors all suffered from the same benighted political  incorrectness.  Makes you stop and think.  Couldn't any thinking Americans  do anything right in that era?  Who is it who has the wisdom to make these  judgments about entire prior generations? (see advice item #1 above).  Oh,  and, World Was II was not a &quot;good&quot; war, and we should not have  dropped the A-bomb.  The author speculates about what she supposes was  &quot;nagging self-doubt&quot; exhibited in the magazine.  She ignores all  cartoons and articles that do not support her political bias.  The New  Yorker did not invent ethnic humor nor is it the only publication ever to  exhibit &quot;smug satisfaction.&quot; The author obviously does not read  the ads for fancy cars and expensive jewelry in today's magazines.  And by  the way, marrying young was not an invention of post-war America. What we  now deplore (some of us) about The New Yorker's alleged elevation of the  power of privilege over principle and of comfort over confrontation, will  look pretty silly when this era is examined by future historians.  The  narrow-mindedness, the Puritanic holier-than-thou attitude, the political  agenda, and above all, the total lack of amiability contained in this book  make it a red flag in today's culture wars: Caveat lector. I'd rather  remember Charles Addams' wonderful captionless cartoon of ski tracks  dividing to go around a tree trunk.	1999-05-05

Johnson draws her characters to perfection and we feel what they feel.  The suspense concerning the outcome of the divorce suit is excruciating and (from this lawyer's point of view) it seemed like a very real international case.  I loved the ironic view of the French, who consider themselves superior but are not in so many ways.  Johnson is a very assured writer and a joy to  read.	1998-04-02

Maxwell has written a minor masterpiece in this tale of two neighboring farm families in the early 1920s.  He manages to get inside the heads of every member of both families, even including the family dog!  His writing is astute, spare, kindly and although the story is tragic, he avoids bathos.  This book should be considered a &quot;sleeper&quot; in American literature, but it ranks up there with the best of Cheever and Updike and is reminiscent of John Gardner.  Not to be missed.	1998-01-14

It is narrated through the imagined or dreamed episodes of the narrator.  The plot concerns an affair between a young Aerican and a French girl of 18.  Although there is sex on almost every page, and there can hardly be any more ways of describing it, the scenes are narrated flatly and are set in dingy, rainy, grungy parts of France.  The affair has nowhere to go, the participants being dependent on one another for their happiness.  Without sex they have nothing to say to each other.  More interesting is the device of the third person narration.  We are given a description of the narrator, but he, too is flat and unemotional.  One might conclude that he has dreamed the whole story up.  Salter's writing is vivid and smooth, but his story is a one-note symphony.  It's hard to empathize with any of the characters, which leaves the main thrust of the book in the bedroom.  But it's better than average.	1998-01-13

The stories are life affirming, in the sense that the protagonists are &quot;good people&quot; who sometimes do a little praying and say Amen.  The situations are not usually exciting, though there is one violent death.  The characters explore loss, new relationships, changes of direction in their lives, and are not afraid to reach out and grasp opportunities.  This is work by an author who is very sure of her medium and her skill.  I found it thought-provoking and greatly interesting.	1998-01-12

They take place all over the world, where the author has been and has detailed knowledge: India, Burma, Thailand, France, New York, Buenos Aires, and one in the south somewhere.  I was impressed by the colorful and poetic use of language:  \\"Miss Bi Chin's water heart flows in uncontrollable sympathy toward the monk.\\"  \\"Inside my body, anticipation's orchestra tuned up: deep thrills on cellos, reedy squeaks.\\"  \\"I lay back and watched the live oaks slip past, their crowns like lung shadows on the X-ray sky.\\"  He used her first name \\"as he'd used mine, like an unpleasant forefinger pointing at her heart.  Or at her ego, to be precise and fair.\\"  \\"By the time I heard his tale, it had been retold so many times that it had flattened into myth, the verbal equivalent of a mural on an Egyptian tomb.\\"  \\"Squiggly rays go from holy man to Edward.\\"  \\"He didn't touch me, just wiped his heavy wingtips on the loon's head mat, his eyes moving from side to side like peeled eggs in a jar of oil.\\"  But these are troubling stories of women at loose ends, striving to find faith in weird religious practices with odd men, or bonding with inappropriate women, or having numberless affairs that leave them baffled and unfulfilled.  None of them have satisfactory relationships with their parents, some are runaways, some throw away promising careers for the slightest of reasons.  The author, ordained in Burma as a Buddhist nun according to the cover blurb, knows whereof she speaks when she writes sarcastically of the east, but one wonders why her characters have allowed themselves to get into the fixes they have.  Though they emerge changed in almost every story, the reader finds it hard to sympathize with them.  Still, the book is a great read	1997-12-22
