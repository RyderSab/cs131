I will only add this WARNING. Those of you, who, like myself, read about this book as the story of his mother's suicide, have been given a slanted idea about \\" A Tale of Love and Darkness.\\" Yes, his mother's suicide is here, but far more than that.<br /><br />As others have said better than I: It's a history of Palestine (pre-Israel), the autobiography of a writer, the way that European Jews experienced lower class/lower middle class life Palestine in the late 30's, early 40's, and all the myriad influences and people that created the great Amos Oz, who is surprisingly modest throughout. REALLY modest.<br /><br />Yes, as others have said, Oz is my favorite author. BUT, no one should imagine that this will be an easy read, because it is not. It isn't written to excite;is not plot-driven but meditative and far-ranging, as well as non-linear. It differs from Oz' other work, both novels and non-fiction, in that way. It is a long march and the reader must do some hard work to keep up with chronology and mostly to keep one's interest going.<br /><br />Do not buy this because of a few sensationalist views. Buy this, and yes, I too believe it is a MASTERPIECE, truly AMAZING-- if you are interested in: writing, Israel, Kibbutz life, in exile and hope, in situational despair, in character portraits, and in Oz himself.<br /><br />His mother's death IS utterly wrenching but hardly the main story and his father comes to life through Oz' genius, as well as his unhappy O how unhappy mom. Also, beware that because he meanders hither and yon, when her death happens it hurts, man o does it! During the second section and esp on the last pages I was sobbing, as her life's end is overwhelmingly sad. But whoever I first read claiming this is the story of his mother, I believe was wrong. It is a HUGE travel and the reader needs energy to keep going, to keep interested until at some point, one is simply hooked.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly but for experienced readers only, not looking for a quick fix, nor a page turner. For those who want a panoramtic and highly detailed tale, yes buy this and work it. I'm so glad Amos Oz dared to write a book so different from his other ones as he is a private man, a great one, and he got so much right here. Dig in and don't expect to love it all, not at the beginning. I remember almost every vignette now but it took three tries to get 'in'.o keep interested until at some point, one is simply hooked.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly but for experienced readers only, not looking for a quick fix, nor a page turner.

Though I've read Pogrebin's non-fiction, and found them extremely memorable,  this first novel of hers is entirely different.<br />I couldn't believe the brilliance that ran through the entire book. Nor do I  understand how anyone can say that these characters were stilted, or were told but not shown. Absolutely untrue, at least for me, each one leapt to life, as did many of the issues Leah, Shoshanna and Rachel brought with them. Each woman, or  daughter was absolutely three dimensional, vivid and unique. I dearly hope one doesn't have to be Jewish and/or a New Yorker to get the depth of the mind that created this work of art.<br />I found all the discussions of Judaic law, of Israel, of discord in a family so nuanced and was mesmerized by the tone of the entire book, which reminded me of Saul Bellow's mind, minus his self-indulgence. This book shines with a brilliance that is, as someone said below, breathtaking. How Pogrebin can make a middle aged woman racing across a busy street to save her rolodex exciting, I can't say, because I can't do it. But this first novel was  dramatic, flowing and exciting from cover to cover.  \\"Three Daughters\\" was for me a rare find. Alas, I am Jewish and a sometime New Yorker, so maybe it's an acquired taste. I surely hope not. Great writing speaks universal truths, and I was simply blown away by this novel, as few others do effect me. I highly recommend all readers to give this book a careful read-through. It's more than 5 stars, and as a first novel, if not a first book, kudos to the author for a wonderful, earth-shattering read. Thank you, Ms. Pogrebin!	2003-04-25

I don't know what we shareholders in a large Manhattan Coop would have possibly done without Sylvia Shapiro's brilliantly written book, &quot;The Coop Bible.&quot; One hundred plus owners were carrying this around, reading it as if it was the 'bible' all this past summer.<br />Even though we comprise over 300 apartments, owned by educated and business wise shareholders, we all needed and imbibed the wisdom, facts and great ideas that Ms Shapiro, head of a Coop Board and a lawyer, gives in this essential book. It is, no exaggeration:  head and shoulders above all others in this field.<br />We are in trouble with our board and with our managers. We would never have been able to mount our &quot;insurrection&quot; without the intelligence throughout this invaluable resource. Her wit and brillance shine through every paragraph. This book, 5 big stars, is something everyone considering buying a condo or coop, or already living in one but unclear as to their rights, should have on their bookshelves.<br />Ms. Shapiro even makes &quot;home visits&quot;  and does so with grace and intelligence. She is as smart and forthright in person as she is in this book. Do buy a copy asap, especially if you live in the wayward ways of Manhattan's buildings which by laws and boards and managers are often not fair nor kosher in relation to the owners. Problems with the above are hard to deconstruct even for the most savvy. She gives great insight, much guidance. Invaluable is the word that springs to mind. 5 Stars!	2002-09-09

To which I'll add that Shields makes many clever moves here--&quot;Unless&quot; is a great book about writing, about the impulse towards fiction, the necessity of writing, its healing aspects, the nuts and bolts.<br />Her feminist rants struck me as full of Irony especially as she is Wrong about the imagined feminist dilemma of the traumatized daughter, and with Reta's famed French mentor, the reining Canadian feminist who, as the world turns, has been traumatized by her own mother. So, the rage against male-domination is layered here, as is almost everything Shields touches.<br />At one point she has the mother/author Reta dismissing all politics, yet it is a political event that is pivotal, if swiftly handled in &quot;Unless&quot;. I disagree with those who say this book is feminine in any traditional sense. Shields is able to &quot;do&quot; philosophy beautifully. Philosophy as it intersects especially with language--those Chapter headings are meditations on words that turn lives, are alluring. She is a philosopher And a story teller, showing the strange way that thought and events can converge and/or diverge. She does this so naturally, like no one else I've ever read.<br />As for the repeated theme of &quot;goodness,&quot; that is also handled ironically, especially as Cramer has written, she achieves greatness here. A multi-dimensional book. No easy way to categorize it, in my opinion. Its plot shows the juxtapostions of living a life vs meditating and thinking on that life. Which is after all, true for all of us, conscious or not. There are continual shocks of self-recognition here.  Nothing simplistic or purely domestic at all. And now I'm off to read the rest of her ouvre, which I've not yet done.	2002-05-25

Now in paperback, it has, curiously and wisely, the same cover as the HC, a lovely image. Here, the paper is whiter, the print is handsome and so there's every reason to own it. Also,k there's a new family tree to help readers see clearly how the characters relate, literally, to one another.<br />I just finished re-reading &quot;Staircase&quot; and it is even more beautiful than I recalled. Hamilton is a wordsmith of such rarity that I consider her among the finest living writers. Her language is never ornate, but her word choice makes this book a MUST for anyone trying to write fiction. She knows more about how to tell a story than any first time novelist has a right to know: about plot, about character development, about how to choose the precise and elegant word.<br />People, BUY this book in paperback, it's an exquisite journey, a trip into another world, one that few have access to any longer. TRULY 5 Stars. So glad that the Number One Customer Reviewer, Ms. Klausner posted here. She's obviously a good reader and she loves this book. As did every professional critic. And ditto over here, a voracious reader.	2002-05-25

She did her research; traveled everywhere and had, via New York Times, mega-access. What she did not have was the right kind of heart to delve into the depths. Also lacking was writing that draws the reader into the adventure. This results, no doubt, from being a mainstream journalist, not a freelancer who has time to spend with ordinary folks in every country.	2001-08-02

Here: past, present and future intersect through fine imagery and almost perfect prose. &quot;Staircase&quot; is rich with visual, emotional and sensuous details, reveals how complex ancestral relationships explode in surprising ways.

I may be too high-brow or too critical, but I kept wondering why anyone would spend time writing this, no less reading it. &quot;In Fidelity&quot; is full of pseudo-wisdom and half-truths, is very busy manipulating the reader--which made me wonder about the writer. Where is the pleasure in recieved ideas and two-dimensional, at best, characters, and with a plot that never soars, but plods. All the seams are showing and yet this book gets much attention. Can someone tell me why? If we want potboilers or sexy one dimensional stories, there are far juicier bad writers.	2001-04-12

She wrote brilliantly. I also know, not as well, the Middle East she writes about in Martyrs' Crossing, a book I read the minute it was available.<br />I wanted to love it, but could not. It is not a good novel because it is more a parable than a plot. There is something terribly predictable here, and also I felt there was a steady  greyness, like rain, running throughout the entire narrative. I believe the author would have been wiser, and benefited her many readers, to stick with non-fiction. That's because for a novel one needs more interiority, less predictablitiy. There is something too pat about her descriptions of the region, even though she clearly knows the current political realities. That's not the point. She doesn't know how to write a good novel. A shame...	2001-03-12

I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It's the fruit of her years as a reader, a writer, a feminist, and a mother. Her persona here is enviably understanding of the men in her life. Weaving her actual life (stories of her kids, and her lucky husband) with the author's characters and with the author's themselves is Chutzpah with Heart. It works. It is SO good that in addition to giving it five stars, I actually had the fleeting thought that it should be more expensive than it is, a first that any like idea has occurred to me about ANY book. Buy it immediately. You will be in heaven while reading it. Brilliant. Award-Winning. Nothing like her essays in The New York Observer, if that's all you know of her writing.

It's an easy read. It's too easy a read. The author left the flesh from her characters, who are skeletal. She also didn't put the mystery in history. I love this time period in Palestine/ Israel, was anticipating a work more engaging, more poetic, revelatory or insightful. But the author plays it close to the bone (or to the skeleton herein). She doesn't spread her fictive wings. The narrative is far more pedestrian than heavenly. I don't recommended this book and am most sorry to say so.	2001-02-14

With that caveat, I will say that those who describe Rhodes' as self-advertizing, by my lights, get it all wrong. In this wonderfully helpful book, which covers not only writing but the pain of publishing too, Rhodes uses his own vast experiences to help others, not to pat himself on the back. Anyone who reads it that way, I believe, is mistaken (or in the wrong mood). I found this book up there with Anne Lamott, Betsy Lerner and on the fact of publisher's mentality towards writers, utterly unique, right on target. He also gives a ton of useful tips from one who  had ups and downs as a writer before winning the Pulizer prize. I prize this book. It crossed my life and came to inform my writing self at the right time, and is helpful as few other self-help books for writers are. Again, all reviews are subjective but those who think he's not delivering the goods, or not our to really help other writers have got it backwards. It takes courage and grit to go out on a limb, using oneself to let others see clearly. Do buy this if you are : a writer having any sort of problem. Richard Rhodes Knows.	2001-01-23

It's rich, dense, withstructural decisions with which one might not agree, BUT it is wonderfully memorable, complex, a rare great read. In addition, as said in my long title, above, reading this as a writer: it's a goldmine. Because Ms. Weber carries this book with a consciousness that mixes the mundane life we all live with a literary savvy we can also enjoy (what some of us live too). To put this simply: the plot can take anyone along but the real treat is to see how an &quot;intellectual&quot; can create an accessible world that has so many philosophical and photographic insights also dispersed throughout. I read the middle flashback section after the first and last because I needed to keep with chronology. But, however you choose to read this, do so. Recommended for those who love a good read and recommended especially for writers. Many many tricks of the trade are embedded if one reads this with a writer's eye. Thanks, Ms. Weber, for a book that seriously challanged this non-fiction writer to reach for more range in my own work. A marvel.	2000-12-13

The mom and daughter write extremely well and their reunion through letters, e-mails and visits is so good it is almost too good to be true. Yet they do shed light on dark side of even the best reunions ...As an adopted mom, who is open, so I thought to birth mothers more than most, I was bothered by the birth mom's seduction of her &quot;daughter&quot; which was obviously going to lead to problems for the relation with adopted mom. That was a subtext they did not addrss.. Also some of the psychological work each does struck me as a little rote. Another flaw: Their writing styles are too similar. Even if true, for the book's sake, they should have emphasized their differences. And not only in writing, but, now that I think about it: the whole point of this book was the display and joy of similarities=their love. I believe, as with their writing styles, that there were too many genetic connections celebrated to be true to life. I am not adopted and found none of the issues purely bound to that &quot;primal wound.&quot; Then again, what do I know about a reunion? All in all: a good and VERY easy read by two very intelligent women who ARE much alike but, guessing here, atypical of most reunions, atypical of  most adoptees, atypical of most birth moms.  Nonetheless, yes, recommended.	2000-11-16

It's a combination memoir, period piece, and mostly an evocation of place. It gives a (slim) view into her life in a neighborhood in Jerusalem. I, like most readers, prefer books that have characters and/ or plot. This book, well intentioned to be sure, has neither. The author never gets a tempo or rhythm going. What a shame.

Without his fame and the media hoopla surrounding this book, it would be seen for what it is: a tour of the divisions among USA Jews at this time, 2000. It is not written by a man with an ear for the art of writing interesting sentences. It is dazzling... not the book, but the fact that far lesser known books can change your life, while this book, like so many bestsellers, is just a prosaic lump of words from on high. I found this tour of Jewish American divisions full of atonal prose. The structure, also, is awkward and the omnicient voice, so male, so passe. I could be wrong about the merits of the book, but unfortunately I'd rather be laid out under a scorching sun for a week than have to bear re-reading this tome. And that's why I give Professor Freedman, who is not short on arrogance, a reluctant 2 stars. Reluctant? Because if everyone else is raving about it, perhaps I am wrong.

I found it compelling enough to stay up  all night reading it. BUT I found the interior and exterior dialogue ...  unrealistic and tiring. Everything is here that needs to be here.  And lots  is here that could have been cut. That would have taken the hard work of  editing out the repetitions, the wordiness, the paragraphs that could have  been pruned to mere! sentences. Maybe when one is as famous as Rosellen  Brown, there is a freedom? to NOT condense. To NOT keep the reader in mind.  So, I come away feeling both moved and tired.

But he hits you over the head with them in &quot;Spirit Matters&quot;. So, one, this reader, begins to wonder about the author's aim? Does he practise what he preaches or does he  preach to hear himself preach? Does this spirituality on-the-page rise from  authentic practise? Are these words full or empty?<br />It's hard to know. I  have read several of Mr. Lerner's other books, notably &quot;Jewish  Renewal&quot;. There, and here too, after overcoming the sea-sickness his  prose style begets, I have to wonder: Is his focus on selflessless real?  Does He find God in everyone he meets, as he suggests? Something about the  tone of tenacity and endless loquacity in &quot;Spirit Matters&quot; has  the quality of protesting too much. Lerner is exhaustive, yes, fine:  but  the writer is equally: Exhausting. Closing this book, I wondered: Does he  walk the talk? Or does he just talk (and talk...)?I'd give this book 1 star  except that the ideas, however wordily conveyed, are good ideas.	2000-07-27

And also that his own family is pivotal to Israeli's political life, their elections. Though the author can be  credited with a certain immediacy, he was mostly writing in his journal for  and about his family. The book is not well organized. It jumps around and  assumes too much interest in his personal life and not enough about the  great world all around him. And his self promotion runs throughout..	2000-05-15

While reading it I found it a little disjunctive, a little disturbing. But it wasn't until I slept that I woke knowing what is wrong with it. Unlike Thomas Friedman, Mr. Horovitz doesn't  mingle, as he admits, with Palestinians nor does he go into the West Bank  or East Jerusalem, except occasionally as a journalist. That would be okay;  what is not okay is the writer's quite unbelievable arrogance. He believes  he might have saved Prime Minister Rabin from his horrid fate--if only he  had been at the peace rally in Tel Aviv the night he was shot! He believes,  or strongly suggests, that his wife single-handedly threw the last Israeli  election--to Mr. Barak. Arrogance isn't interesting and neither is most of  this book. An attitude lies beneath it that is faux macho and lacking  artistic value.	2000-05-14

She's as funny as Anne Lamott, as personal as Natalie Goldberg. She is both an excellent writer and was a (top) editor at major publishing  houses as well. Now an agent, Ms. Lerner covers the writing life from all  vantage points, allowing all writers (and serious readers) to see the  editor's and agent's point of view, insights about which most writers  remain seriously in the dark. No Longer! Betsy Lerner's humor and wisom  make this book a page turner; I couldn't put it down. And having read it  twice, I feel so much the wiser for all the insights she offers. She's  succinct; she's hilarious and she holds a mirror to writers' lives as few  books do. Every writer on this planet will find him/herself here.. Which  means that writers the world over will have all those mysterious questions  about: agents, editors, acceptance and what goes on behind the dark screen  that is publishing resolved. As far as I know, no book has ever covered all  these bases before...If I could, I'd give this book 10 stars.	2000-05-13

HAVE A HEART!  I never found the notion of the Ramseys as murderers credible...They had no history of chld abuse, none. There were too many media distortions: a lynch mob psychology that surroundeded, and continues  to surround, them. I was impressed with the writing here, the emotional  logic, the credible string of details... I read it through in one sitting.<br />If you already believed in their innocence, this story is almost  unbearably poignant. Beneath the surface story lies an atmosphere of loss  and grief and attempts at stoicism that is heartwrenching.<br />If you are  sure they are guilty, it's important to just read this story and see that  the stress  they endure could happen to anyone.. If you are wealthy in  America, it's a weird rage that you can evoke--the Ramseys sure did. If you  are not Jewish, not cosmopolitan, not hip, not New Age, not intellectuals,  they are easy targets for derision. But what opened for me, who am all of  the above, was a whole world, the consciousness of being a Southerner,  being family-oriented, self-made, hard-working, quietly masculine dad,  ornamental oriented mom. For all that, in additon to their supposed GReat  Wealth, they were TARGETED. Readers with closed minds should at least try  and give them a hearing... Unlike other reviewers, I found the book not  only highly readable but well crafted. I don't know how they have held  themselves together. Their faith is alien to me and to most I know. And  yet, and yet... they explain a lot, clarify a lot and show an honesty  I do  not understand why others readers write off as so very suspect. They have  worked very hard to keep their life force going, and have more than less  succeeded. This narrative tallies. It clarifies. It tracks. I do not  understand those who vilify them. On what basis, aside from hatred of  Southern values, family money, Christian piety... do Americans decide that  they are guilty? Read this with an open mind. Put yourself in their shoes  and in JonBent's. Have a Heart! Think for Yourselves! Don't let newspapers  and TV have the last word.JonBent's. Have a Heart! Think for Yourselves!
