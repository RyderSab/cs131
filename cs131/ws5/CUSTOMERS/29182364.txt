Books	5	9	9	N	N	A harrowing journey	To those unfamiliar with French literature, this may seem a frustrating (if remarkably well written) book.  For in this book about nuclear conspiracy, terrorism, and fanaticism that span the globe, Bernard-Henri Levy frankly admits his own uncertainties.  It's as though he is constantly saying, \\"This happened.  Almost certainly it was this that happened.\\"  But then he stops, thinks, and pronounces, \\"But really, if you look at it from another point of view, taking this detail into account, it was really this that happened.  Almost certainly this.\\"<br /><br />And the reader, who perhaps expects the certainty and the suspense one finds in Robert Baer's prose (a certainty that Levy condemns) might be tempted to scream, \\"But finally what is this book about?\\"<br /><br />The answers are simple.  It is about a very smart man who was at home with himself and the whole world.  A Jewish American (Danny Pearl) whose passionate interest in men and women led ultimately to his horrific murder.<br /><br />It is about a \\"perfect Englishman\\" who was born in the maternity ward of Whips Cross Hospital in London's eastern suburbs. Like Danny this boy grows up between worlds; like Danny he is a prodigy. But unlike Danny, this boy, can never belong; not even inside his own skin.  And so he (Omar Sheikh) grows up to become not a reporter but one of the human links between al Qaeda and the Pakistani secret services.  He comes to be called Osama bin Laden's favorite son.  He grows up to hijack airlines, murder Indian civilians, help finance 9/11, and (ultimately) trap Danny Pearl.<br /><br />It is a story about a world where \\"Islamism is business\\" and where there are set prices for certain operations.  A world where the family of a prospective suicide bomber and the sponsoring organization negotiate the price of a man's death.  A world in which \\"suicide attack candidates come to fill out applications almost as naturally as for a loan.\\"<br /><br />It is a story about nuclear weapons.  About Bin Laden's (officially sanctioned) contacts with the fathers of Pakistan's nuclear bomb.  About the Pakistani Oppenheimer who feels that this bomb belongs to the entire Islamist community.  About a country where the \\"day of the first nuclear test-28 May-has the unofficial status of a religious holiday.\\"<br /><br />And it is about how two states (United States and Pakistan) encouraged the growth of Islamism within their own borders.  Pakistan to use against India; US to use against the Soviet Union.  And now, today, there are Islamist kolkhozes throughout America and Canada.  Kolkhozes run by one of Osama bin Laden's most trusted ideologues.  And Pakistan, nuclear Pakistan, is on the brink of collapse.<br /><br />And finally, this book is about one man (Danny Pearl) who may have stumbled on some (or all or more) of this and who was murdered for knowing too much.  And for being an American and a Jew..  About Bin Laden's (officially sanctioned) contacts with the fathers of Pakistan's nuclear bomb.

For, to both these men, the great sin is compromising one's principles for the sake of realpolitik.<br /><br />Perhaps because he feels a political kinship with Orwell, Hitchens' essay about him is so passionate.  In it, Hitchens defends Orwell from attacks from the Left (including from Hitchens' good friend Edward Said); takes pains to point out that Orwell cannot be read as a creature of the Right (a charge often leveled at Hitchens himself); and shows too that Orwell's was the face of the decent Englishman (one who, like Hitchens, was deeply ambivalent about `Englishness').<br /><br />And yet to Hitchens' credit, this is not an idealized portrait of Orwell.  Hitchens does not close his eyes to Orwell's lapses such as his lifelong detestation of homosexuality and feminism; nor is he blind to the racial prejudices Orwell worked his life to overcome.  Hitchens reports these human failings honestly; without attempting to \\"whitewash\\" them.<br /><br />The result is a genuine and eminently readable book that serves as good an introduction to Orwell as it does to Hitchens.  I highly recommend it.	2005-08-14

For that reason I would recommend this collection to people who are interested only in the development of international law and mores and who are not much concerned with the Iraq War.<br /><br />For those who are interested in the Iraq War, this collection is, I feel, indispensable.  Not because the authors agree (they do not) but because the debate in this volume has about it a quality that has been largely absent from the Iraq debate: candor.  Thus while the authors disagree on fundamental issues such as:<br /><br />* was the war in Iraq, on balance, justified;<br /><br />* did the governments that lead us to war lie or act in good faith;<br /><br />* was the suffering of the Iraqi people alone sufficient justification for war; and<br /><br />* do we have what it takes to see this war through<br /><br />they do so without simplifying the arguments and without assuming that the Iraqi people agree with their positions.<br /><br />For as profound as their disagreements are, the authors agree that:<br /><br />* Saddam's regime was genocidal;<br /><br />* leaving Saddam in place was not costless either (and most immediately) to the Iraqi people or (eventually) to the West; and<br /><br />* the Bush administration has terribly botched the occupation, thereby endangering the whole enterprise.<br /><br />And finally these authors point out that when in a public policy debate, the liberals sound like Henry Kissinger while the conservatives echo John Rawls, the political landscape is out of joint.<br /><br />This is the sort of debate liberals like myself had every right to expect in the days and months preceding the Iraq invasion.  We did not get it (for reasons addressed in this volume).  We get it here; in this collection of essays.  I highly recommend it.	2005-07-18

For this is at once a book about McCarthyism, family, and memory.  But perhaps most of all, it is about the human capacity to remember and to betray each other; a capacity undiminished with time.  As Roth points out \\"The master story situation in the Bible is betrayal.  Adam-betrayed.  Esau-betrayed.  The Schechemites-betrayed.  Judah-betrayed.  Joseph-betrayed.  Moses-betrayed.  Samson-betrayed.  Samuel-betrayed.  David-betrayed.  Uriah-betrayed.  Job-betrayed.  Job betrayed by whom?  By none other than God himself.  And forget the betrayal of God.  God betrayed by our ancestors at every turn.' (p. 185)<br /><br />And every character in this book is also betrayed.  Nathan is betrayed.  Nathan's father is betrayed.  Ira is betrayed.  Murray is betrayed.  Eve is betrayed.  Dorris is betrayed.  All of them are betrayed by themselves and by America.  An America they believe in; an America that never ceases to disappoint them for not living up to her potential.<br /><br />But finally too America is betrayed.  America is betrayed by Richard Nixon, the man who as much as McCarthy was responsible for McCarthyism and who it turns out, was no better than a common crook.  A petty common thief.<br /><br />And that perhaps is the moral (if there is one) of this story.  For the betrayals, all of them are petty.  They are petty because \\"people give up too easily and fake their feelings.  They want to have feelings right away, and so `shocked' and `moved' are the easiest.  The stupidest\\" (p. 219).  People want to be good; they want to be right; they want to be caring.  But being good, and right and caring involves a great deal of emotional and mental energy.  It involves work and it involves overcoming of prejudices.  Most people are not prepared to put in that kind of effort-nor do they want to.  How much easier to unthinkingly mouth the words Nixon and McCarthy put into your mouth?  For McCarthyism was the political correctness of the 1950s and if you simply said you hated the Reds or communists or whatever it was you were supposed to hate, people would say you were good.  And who knows?  Perhaps, like Eva, you might even have believed them.<br /><br />And then you would have been betrayed.  By McCarthyism, by yourself.  A petty betrayal of your own making.and McCarthy put into your mouth?

That is the question that haunts me now that I have put this incredible book down.  Is it a simple exercise of \\"finding your facts, selecting your facts, arranging your facts, considering missing facts, and explaining your facts\\" or is it, like all writing, a river flowing \\"toward the writer's own body and the writer's own experience\\"?  Is a biography then, in some way, an auto-biography?  After all, what is a fact (and how is it different from fiction)?  And what makes this (and not that) fact important?<br /><br />How will I (or a biographer) know it when we see it?  And what, in the end, is \\"experience\\"?<br /><br />This story, as much of a mystery as a story, grapples with these and other questions.  I was not necessarily satisfied with the answers-tentative as they were-at the end but that was not the point.  The point was the question; and the question is a good one.<br /><br />It made me think.	2004-12-05

Byatt readers have come to expect.  And as such, these five realistic fairy tales for adults will surely not disappoint.  But these tales are, in some way, something more.

Free to live our own lives, comfortable with themselves, their worlds, and their selves.  Free to know we are, indeed, quite special after all.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.	2004-11-22

And that decency, that honesty and sense of fair play come through loud and clear through this wonderful mix of editorial pieces and personal letters.  It does not matter whether he is writing about the Socialist movement, the Monarchy, the manner in which Americans were treated in England during WWII, the English language, writing, colonialism, nationalism, anti-Semitism, or how to make a proper cup of tea, his honesty is ever-present.  For he wrote these essays (I think) because although \\"emotional urges which are inescapable, and are perhaps even necessary to political action, [they] should be able to exist side-by-side with reality.  But this requires a moral effort.\\"  If you are prepared to make such a moral effort-or simply want to spend a few nights with a truly wonderful human being and gifted writer, I highly recommend this book.	2004-10-16

It is a story about change, about growing up, about dreams.  It is a story about families, their loves and even their politics.  It is a story about occupation and colonialism.

And yet they like intellectuals from all over the world have come together, in this book, to gaze with heart-breaking pain at the age-old specter of anti-Semitism.  Their \\"solutions\\" are many; their ideological commitments are numerous but they have one thing in common: they refuse to look away from this hideous spectacle though looking at it causes them intense pain.<br />It is with pain that Melanie Phillips writes, \\"Want to make yourself, really, really unpopular if you're a Jew?  Try saying that the world is witnessing a terrifying firestorm of hatred directed at Israel and the Jewish people in which the Europeans are deeply implicated\\"; it is with pain that Edward Said writes that \\"There is now a creeping, nasty wave of anti-Semitism insinuating itself into our political thought and rhetoric...When I mentioned the Holocaust in an article I wrote here last November I received more vilification than I thought possible..\\"  The pain these authors feel is evident; so evident that the reader will need to take breaks from this book.  Frequent breaks.  For the pictures it paints-from the European, American, Arab, or Israeli perspectives are not pretty ones.  They are ugly as only racism can be ugly.<br />But the authors of this book do not flinch from this ugliness; they stare it in the face.  They expose it for what it is.  They do not hide it behind euphemisms and double standards; they assure it that (as Harold Evans puts it) \\"There are things which are bad, and false, and ugly, and no amount of specious casuistry will make them good or true or beautiful.\\"<br />This book was written by those who dared to look, unflinching at this ugliness and, more, to write about it; to expose it.  And that is what makes this book, if not enjoyable, then immensely precious and worthwhile.  For it was written by the decent amongst us.<br />I recommend it.ile.

A seemingly unlikely friendship between a Tory Prime Minister and a Progressive President.  A friendship between an extroverted, warm human being and an introverted, many layered and often secretive man.  A friendship between two men who lived in a time not so very different from our own, when certainties were few, enemies seemed to spring up like mushrooms, and the whole world in danger.<br />Their friendship did much to save that world.  It was a friendship that made D-Day possible; and it was in part thanks to that friendship that Winston and Franklin made a joint decision to avenge, not save the victims of the Holocaust.  Their decisions saved and cost millions of lives.  They were two friends, doing their best in a world plunged into darkness.  And they brought it out again-together.<br />Winston Churchill led Britain when that island stood alone against Hitler for one year; Franklin Roosevelt patiently prodded an isolationist nation into accepting the responsibility that comes with power.  And in the end, they made a \\"world that is for many a better one than existed before\\" (283).<br />Thanks to their efforts, when \\"an American President and a British prime minister [today] walk through the woods of Camp David, or confer on a transatlantic telephone, they are working in the style and in the shadow of Roosevelt and Churchill. [They are reaffirming] the Anglo-American alliance [that] has been the bedrock of global order for decades\\" (366).<br />A bedrock Winston and Franklin created in those fraught years of a world war.	2004-06-07

Al-Andalus. Andalucia.  Spain.  Few in this country knew what he was talking about&quot; (255).  I (unknowingly following in Mary Lee Settle's footsteps) decided to find out.<br />Yet it was so difficult to discover any information about post-1492 Spain.  I had a hard time finding books telling me about Knights Templar's history and tragic end in Il Torre Sangrienta (the tower of blood); giving me an intimate portrait of Black Virgin's of Guadalupe's haunting eyes; telling me of Unamunno's dramatic defiance of Franco's regime; or telling me the scandal in Zamora.  And I had no joy at all in finding a book that tells the story of the many Spains (for in truth as Mary Lee Settle makes clear there is not ONE Spain but many) as though all its rich history grew up naturally--from the stones in the ground.  As though this history were but part and parcel of the sights, sounds, and smell of modern Spain.  Until, of course, I found this book.<br />For Mary Lee Settle's book does all of the above.  She tells her and Spain's story from the vintage point of an often lost and eternally fascinated traveler.  A traveler who romps through the physical Spain and through Spain's history equally and who manages to construct an immensely readable and thoroughly enjoyable book interweaving both journeys.<br />It is not, however, a history book and it freely admits this.  Indeed, perhaps one of the most precious (to me) parts of this book is the frequent history book recommendations.  Mary Lee Settle's Spanish Recognitions is thus the ideal book for someone like me: someone who wants to read about Spain's rich history and who would like to travel there armed with historical and cultural knowledge but who is not sure how to get started.<br />I highly recommend it.dge but who is not sure how to get started.<br />I highly recommend it.	2004-05-21

Jews are murdered, cut up, their murderers dip their hands in their victims? blood and the media says nothing, nothing at all.<br />A writer of Phyllis Chesler?s stature, a woman who virtually created a strand of feminism, writes a book sympathetic to Jews and to Israel and she is shunned by her colleagues; dis-invited to lectures; her books no longer sell.  All this because she, a woman who learned her feminism while married to an Afghani in Afghanistan wrote a book on anti-Semitism.  Because she broke a taboo.<br />These are chilling examples.  But perhaps the most troubling (to me at least) chapter in this brilliant book was entitled ?Modern Anti-Semitism before 9/11?.  Most of this chapter is a list really.  Part of it for, example reads ?On September 5, 1995, a terrorist broke into Daniel Frei?s house in Ma?aleh Michmash.  He was only 28 years old?. On November 13, 2000, two bombs exploded ?. On January 22, 2002? Danny Pearl?.?  This chapter is 47 pages long.  It covers terrorist attacks against Jews from 1920s till September 2001.  These atrocities took place all over the world.  And no-one said anything.<br />Why?  Because these attacks on Jews were not called pogroms; they were called attacks on Zionists.<br />They were and are the new anti-Semitism.  And the world?s reaction is the old silence and consent.	2004-04-24

For starters, it's in Latin, not English.  And, to add insult to injury, the Latin terms most often used have virtually no relation to the concepts they are supposed to represent.  Furthermore, teachers tend to teach Math which Ilan Samson rightly defines as \\"accurate, multu-stage reasoned thinking\\" by rote.  Why should we do it this way, Mrs. Smith?  Because I said so.<br /><br />So Ilan Samson wrote a revolutionary book that looks, in many ways like a standard Math book.  Perhaps it is a bit more readable than most; perhaps it has more jokes-but basically it's an ordinary math book.  With one important difference: it's written in English.  Not a Latin word anywhere.  So Ilan translates 4 to the power of 6 into self.mult 4, num.mult 6.  No, it doesn't sound right-but it gets your attention.  And once it gets your attention, you are able to follow along.  Not only that, but you can work out (without the benefit of a Latin dictionary) what these terms mean.  You can intuit that self.mult means a number that is multiplied by itself and num.mult means the number of times that number should be multiplied by itself.  And if you can work this out without looking at a math book, it means that self.mult 4, num.mult 6 makes more sense than 4 to the power of 6.  It means these not very elegant (but very English) terms make sense.<br /><br />And that's important.  Because terms that make sense allow us to \\"learn the meaning of every element in a given task\\".  We can thus work out (using only the terms as our guide) that since self.mult 7 num.mult 3 means 7 multiplied by itself three times and since self.mult 7 num.mult 5 is 7 multiplied by itself 5 times, the product of self.mult 7, num.mult 3 and self.mult 7, num.mult 5 is self.mult 7 num.mult 3 + 5 or 8.<br /><br />Really simple, isn't it?  And all for one equally simple reason: this math book is in English, not Latin.  This math book is not a traditional math book but it is very, very good at teaching math.  It explains each step of the way, it shows us exactly why similar triangles are important (p. 133) and how one goes about proving it and it is actually fun.<br /><br />For people like me, who have never liked Math much this was a timely reminder-one I am using at work.  I highly recommend it for any professional who deals with numbers, any student reviewing for math exams (eg SATs) for any teacher faced with a class filled with students asking too many questions, and for any college student who needs a reminder on how to do the things your professor just assumes you know.n.

For example, after George Bush published the roadmap for peace (something Tony Blair worked very hard to achieve) the Prime Minister received a call from Yasser Arafat.  He spent a bit of time on the phone with him (and got a chance to say a brief hello and congratulations to Abu Mazen before Arafat snatched the phone away) and when he replaced the receiver, he looked up at a television screen to see \\"a Palestinian representative damning Bush's motives.\\"<br />He says nothing but his aid says it for him, \\"They've got to be told [that] this is their chance.  If they don't use it, they'll lose it.\\"<br />And then there is the never-ending frustration with the BBC which John Reid may or may not have called the Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation.  But \\"even if he didn't say it,\\" Peter Stothard assures us, \\"it's ___ well true.\\"  The Secretary of Defense (and his porcelain cup which nearly suffered a terrible fate thanks to the BBC) would most likely agree.<br />And then there are the conspiracy theories out on the street, just outside No. 10.

In some ways, reading these stories (stories attuned to the everyday details of our lives); stories that describe the ringing of the phone, the belt buckle of the hairdresser; the color of the still-alive lobster in his \\"cage\\" with as much, if not more, attention as they do the \\"big themes\\" of life, death, and marriage.  They are haunting, they are short and crisp and precise.  The language flows gracefully and forcefully (though you do not notice the force until later; until you have closed the book).<br />And they stay with you.	2004-01-11

This tells us of the friends and foes he makes in his quest; of the Kurds he befriends in Iraq-the ones who nearly overthrew Saddam but stopped their operation because the White House could not \\"remember to care\\" whether Saddam was in power or not-and the enemies he makes.  Perhaps most notable of the last is Sheila Heslin, a prominent DC lawyer who represented Caspian oil in the Clinton Administration.<br />It is also the story of a quest that almost became an obsession: Robert Baer's determination to find out who was behind the bombing of the US embassy in Beirut in 1983.  He discovered his answer 15 years later: Yassir Arafat's Fatah bombed the US embassy on Iran's orders.  At the same time Robert Baer discovered that Usama bin Laden had made an alliance with Iran and with Egyptian fundamentalists-the latter most likely with ties to Arafat.<br />And last of all it is the story of an organization.  An organization that goes from being a serious spy agency to one that is so politically correct and so politicized at every level that when Robert Baer suggested sending someone to interview fleeing Afghanis, the central CIA office recommended giving them sexual harassment training instead.  For the \\"mantra at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue seemed to be: Get through the term.  Keep the bad news from the newspapers.  Dump the naysayers.  Gather money for the next election-globs and globs of it-and let some other administration down the line deal with it.  Worst of all, the CIA had decided to go along for the ride.\\"<br />And as a result, when the terrorists in Iran, PLO, and Saudi Arabia declared war on the US and the West, we decided to ignore them.  With what results, we all know.	2003-11-12

The CIA, for which Robert Baer worked, was informed in no uncertain terms that if a CIA operative \\"were to somehow turn over a rock and tattle to Washington [about the Saudis] his next job would be running the basement candy store in Langley.\\"<br />And never mind that the Saudis are currently financing every single terror cell from Chechnya to Kansas to Gaza.  (In this book you can discover, among other things, how much the operation in Kansas, USA costs.)  And never mind that this is as true today as it was before September 11, 2001.<br />And the same \\"consent to silence\\" applies to our \\"new best friend in the Middle East-Qatar\\".  We know, of course, that Qatar's foreign minister is sending al Qaeda checks on a regular basis but that does not seem to trouble post-9/11 Washington too much.  For although this man (called \\"good Hamad\\" inside the Beltway) probably paid to have 3,000 people slaughtered on September 11, 2001 he ALSO let Enron close a multi-billion-dollar natural gas deal in Qatar.  And for that, the oil tycoons (the people who really run Washington D.C.) are prepared to overlook a few flaws.<br />And when Robert Baer tried to get his former employer, the CIA, to pick up these many-fold threats to our national security; when he e-mailed the CIA the names, places, and targets he got a two word reply from his former bosses: \\"No interest\\".<br />Indeed, the only man Robert Baer could find who was interested in yet more Americans being murdered was a young Wall Street Journal reporter named Danny Pearl.  Danny never lived to see this book but it is dedicated to him and to \\"his unrelenting search for truth\\".<br />It is a book I like to think Danny would have approved of.<br />More importantly, it is a book that any American who wants to make sure that 9/11 does not happen again MUST read.read.	2003-10-19

For example, Israeli soldiers carefully guarded a Palestinian hospital's water and oxygen supply and blew up nothing that might endanger the hospital despite the fact that it served as a refuge for several wanted fugitives. The man who claimed that the IDF somehow endangered the hospital was in fact being treated in a hospital while the Jenin operation was occurring.  The hospital was in Afulla and it is an Israeli hospital.<br /><br />One of them men interviwed for this book, Abu Riali, was also interviewed by al Jazeera television.  It was there that he made up his story about &quot;thousands of victims&quot; (a story the UN later proved to be completely false).<br /><br />The book talks about a child who died when Israeli tanks flattened a Palestinian house.

Here we see a person who throughout his life sought to determine what was in the public interest and who then tried to persuade the people to act for their own good.  But he never tried to place what he thought good \\"above what they did\\".  Furthermore, he never tried to gain even adequate compensation for his long and hard years as a public servant because he believed that private property was not a natural but a society-given right and that society should therefore see to it that no-one had too much wealth.<br />This, of course, is not a view often associated with the author of the Poor Man's Almanac-even though he held this opinion since at least 1750 when he wrote that \\"what we have above what we can use, is not properly ours, tho' we possess it.\\"  Yet it is a view that we in a time littered with corrupt politicians who steal several million here and a billion there; who impose their idea of what is good on a people who as often as not are forced to obey or be killed; in a time when these thugs are yet called \\"leaders\\", might do well to recall.<br />For here in a little over 300 pages we have a portrait of a true leader.  A man who spoke little, listened a lot, and who led Americans to independence (although he would have personally preferred a British Empire of Equals).  It would be good for us to remember this man for we live in a time when the men we call leaders are often anything but.  Yet, perhaps when we recognize what makes a true leader we will once again have them.	2003-10-05

It does not prove any of its allegations for the simple reason that they have been Disproved --in at least one case in a New York Court of Law (a detail this book omits).<br />It never mentions any of the conclusions reached in any of the inquiries held (in different countries) about many of the incidents it portrays here.<br />Nor, does it even mention what Palestinians say about all this.  It does not, for example, mention the plight of Palestinians like Raja Shehadeh who are marked men because they truly want peace.<br />But that is not surprising--for in this book purportedly about the Palestinians the Palestinian voice is remarkably absent.  The Palestinians are never asked and their esponses are never recorded.  We know what the authors think the Palestinians' plight is; we do not, however, have any idea what the Palestinians themselves think.<br />For those truly interested in what is happening in the Territories from a Palestinian perspective, I would highly recommend Strangers in the House: Coming of Age in Occupied Palestine instead.<br />by Raja Shehadeh, Anthony Lewis	2003-10-02

Here we have Leila, an American, who chooses the Islamic-Iranian way over the American one because when she was ill and her family was too busy to drop everything for her busy she kept thinking \\"if I were in Iran the family would drop everything.  As soon as I was cured, I came back here and it really is a good life\\" (103).  And Geraldine Brooks takes pains to point out that for many women like American-born Queen Noor it is, indeed, a good life.  But she also points out that for other women: the women who suffer honor killings, clitoridectomy, inability to drive, inability to move around without a male relative's permission, inability to have a job that either their husband or the \\"politeness police\\" find inappropriate-it is not a good life.  And that these women live not only in some exotic Middle Eastern country; they are also our next-door neighbors.<br />And even as she finds it very agreeable to take a break from her own male-dominated world of journalism while \\"squatting on the floor of a Kurdish friend's kitchen, helping the women with the bread-making... surrounded by women [and doing] a task that was ours alone\\" (235), she is not at all pleased that a little boy is able to come in and break off tiny morsels of the bread while his sister is already \\"part of our bread-making assembly line.  Why should he learn so young that her role was to toil for his pleasure?\\" (235)<br />Indeed, why should he learn that at all?<br />For in such a world; a world where women are behind a curtain; where they must do things for their husbands' or brothers' pleasure, there is not one world but two.  In a book that looks at the lives Muslim women lead all over the world from Iran to Britain, Geraldine Brooks points out how the curtain segregating the men from the women has created in Islam \\"a dual society of male and female stranger to one another and unaware of each other's anxieties\\" (182).<br />She writes of women who find this arrangement relaxing, of professional Muslim women who look for a perfect husband \\"for babies\\" and nothing else and she writes of families who struggle to find ways of doing things together in strictly segregated societies.  She writes as much of happiness as of pain.  But most of all she writes of segregation.  Of two worlds: one for women and one for men and never the twain shall meet.  And, in the end she asks us all, is this what we really want?  Or will we make a stand against segregation based on sex?

Told in a series of sketches against the backdrop of European and German histories, this book combines the best of fiction and non-fiction in a seamless and utterly readable whole.<br />It is refreshing too that there are neither demons nor saints in these pages.  The Jews portrayed here (from Mendelsohn to Arendt) are simply people who try to convince themselves that they too can be German.  And for a while they succeeded not in becoming German (for the Germans never regarded them as anything but pariahs) but in convincing themselves that they had achieved that much-coveted status.<br />And when they had convinced themselves they forgot that \\"the step-child must always be on his best behavior,\\" forgot even that they were step-children; so heady was the illusory promise of Emancipation, so wondrous was Kaiser's pledge that \\"he no longer knows any parties, [he knows] only Germans\\" that the Jews allowed themselves to be deceived.  During WWI, they were \\"as conformist\\" as all others, forgetting that in war hatred abounds and that the fastest way to get hold of an ideology is to declare that they hate someone.  And that the easiest group to hate is a minority that had always been persecuted.<br />The reminder (a Jew census to determine how many Jews served on the front lines) was a shock but it was not a big enough shock to make the Jews flee Germany.  A place where they had lived for thousands of years; where they had lived before the Germans arrived.  For, as Amos Elon makes clear, there was noting inevitable about the Holocaust.  Even at the very end of the Weimar Republic, there was a paradox of surging Nazism and increasing assimilation, of growing anti-Semitism and growing Jewish prominence for Jews in every field in Weimar culture.\\"  For the Jews this meant that they could cling to the belief that they could yet become German; for the Nazis this meant that the Jews were increasingly prominent and therefore so much easier to hate.<br />The end we know.<br />But there was so much more to the German Jewry than their horrible and tragic end.

In these pages you will find a sketch of a man who was a Jew, a philosopher, a lover of Western culture and ideals, an American, and a homosexual who was dying of AIDS while looking for love; while teaching.  In it you will see a man who explained to his students (hand-chosen for their brains) the importance of Plato in a world where \\"you can't tell the wars from NBA events\\" (55).<br />This is a sketch of a Jew who, if given the choice between Athens and Jerusalem would have preferred to live in Athens but who mixed in Jewish jokes and expositions when expounding on Greek philosophers and who, at the end of his life, decided that a Jew \\"should take deep interest in the history of the Jews-in their principles of justice for example\\" (179).  That these principles were contained in the Torah, the Talmud and Commentaries which the avowed atheist Ravelstein seems to have recollected literally on his deathbed did not seem to bother him.  He was an atheist because philosophers had to be atheists; he \\"was following the trail of Jewish ideas or Jewish essences\\" (178) because he was a Jew and he still joked that \\"even God took his holidays in Paris\\" (which he loved).<br /><br />This is a sketch of a man who protested against the cultural and ethical relativism of today's liberal society because this society keeps us childish; it doesn't force us to do the grown-up thing and make choices.  And \\"it's up to you to make a choice.  Either you continue to see as a child, or else\\" (98).<br />But above all, this is a sketch of a man in love with life itself.  A man who was always searching for his \\"other half\\" who acquired HIV in his quest and who would not stop looking despite his illness.  A man who loved to gossip but who never betrayed a confidence, never let a friend down.  A man who was, above all, honest with himself and with those around him.  Ravelstein was who and what he was: a Jew, a philosopher, a homosexual, a man questioning all \\"isms\\".  Such a man, such a friend is indeed difficult to \\"give up... to death\\" (233).<br />And by writing this deeply moving book, Saul Bellow did not.he was: a Jew, a philosopher, a homosexual, a man questioning all \\"isms\\".

This is at one level an uplifting autobiography of an extraordinary man but at another level it is a guide to us a people living in a cynical (we call it \\"realistic\\") age in which we are bombarded by so many causes; all of them claiming to worthwhile, all of them claiming that they will uplift human dignity and freedom.  How can we choose amongst these causes?  How can we tell which cause is truly just and, having decided, how do we champion it effectively?<br />In his autobiography, Martin Luther King helps us do so.  He explains that \\"constructive ends can never give absolute moral justification to destructive means, because in the final analysis the end is preexistent in the means\\" (20).  Thus, if those whose cause we would champion are murdering babies to achieve justice, the end they and we will achieve will be child murderers whether we want it or not.  But if those whose cause we would champion march peacefully to save a life, write countless letters on behalf of a starving child, collect money so that a woman who has been cast out by her society and is facing death might have a good legal defense, then we can be assured that the end we will achieve with our peaceful means will be a saved and happy life.  Not least of all our own.<br />And how should we effectively champion our truly just cause; a cause we know is just because the means its proponents use to achieve their ends are right and noble?  We should concentrate on one issue at a time, highlighting that one issue by non-violent means.  And we must use nonviolence for today we do not face a choice between violence and non-violence but between \\"nonviolence and nonexistence\\" (360).<br />So let us choose, in our cause and in our methods existence over the nihilism of all too many movements that claim to be revolutionary and yet which \\"reject the one thing that keep the fire of revolutions burning: the ever-present flame of hope\\" (329).  Let us choose those causes that would bring our fellow men and women life and that would bring us all hope.  Let us follow in the footsteps of Dr Martin Luther King and, like him, not follow false causes that (like the Black Power Movement he gives as an example) promise much but deliver only death and despair.life and that would bring us all hope.

A woman who did much to save the Jews being persecuted by the various Inquisitions by, among other things, purchasing Safed to be a haven for Jews.  But that is not what this book is \\"about.\\"  For the question it seeks to answer is a very modern one.  This book tries to tell us why we should bother being Jewish, Sephardic, or anything at all; why being \\"just human\\" is not enough.<br />And as the story weaves in and out of romance, history, and all-too-familiar contemporary issues of feminism vs. family vs. career, we gradually come to realize, that it is worth being \\"a someone ethnic\\" because only by being Jewish, Sephardic, or any other culture can we \\"learn from the good that was part of your history, that which ennobled and raised your people even higher.\\"  We learn not \\"to insist that we were born rootless because the past can't be overcome.\\" Nor should it be overcome.  For in this world of \\"jeans and Rollerblades and bad T-shirts and Walkmans... there is no danger in our differences; but in the overwhelming tedium of the ... sameness that is drowning out what each of us has learned, what each of us can contribute.\\"<br />So in the end this beautifully-written historical romance asks (begs, really) all of us, whatever our culture or ethnicity to hold on to our rich heritage and thereby stop what many sociologists have called the McDonaldization of our world.	2003-09-04

And it is a story about a boy becoming a writer.<br />There must be thousands such coming-of-age stories; thousands of stories about that first (and naturally unrequited) love; and, since most of the people who write these stories are authors there are even a few tales of how boys grow up to become writers.<br />And yet this tale is haunting.  It grips the reader and never lets him go till the end and even long after.  And that is because this is also a story about a murder.<br />The murder is barely mentioned.  Oh, the narrator invokes it once or twice when for example he tells us that when he looked out at his family members during a Passover meal \\"most of whom, a few years later would be swallowed up by German crematory ovens\\" he found almost all of them terribly bland and bourgeois.  He also mentions it at the beginning when he informs us that his first (unrequited) love, Micol, her father, her mother, and her Grandmother were all \\"deported to Germany in the autumn of `43\\".  But that's not what this story is about.<br />This is not a story about concentration camps and the mechanized degradation there.  This is a hauntingly, heart-breakingly beautiful story about a young man and a first love in a wondrous garden.  A story that comes to an abrupt end because the children (the real flowers in the Garden of the Finzi-Continis) are made to pay the ultimate price because the Italians around them first resented that \\"the Jews were not enough like the others and then, having ascertained their almost total assimilation into their surroundings, [resented] the opposite: that they were just like the others.\\"<br />It is, in the end (to paraphrase Amos Oz), about Jews who were not to be special and who were not to be banal; who were not to be.	2003-08-30

The instructor assured us that this book was \\"all about\\" Faulkner's fear of and jealousy of women or more specifically of our reproductive power.  Even though I was very much a feminist at the time (hence the class in the first place) I admit, this interpretation ruined the book for me.<br />In fact, I never finished this book while at college and only read enough to get an \\"A\\" on the term paper and exam.  It wasn't until very recently that a good friend of mine finally succeeded in convincing me to give Faulkner another chance.  I did and this review is a kind of thank you to that friend.<br />For Absalom, Absalom! is an incredible work.  For those of you who want to know \\"what it's all about,\\" the plot is fairly simple: a poor boy goes to the West Indies to make his fortune, meets a woman there, marries her, finds out she is part Black, repudiates her and his child, gets another (White) wife and family.  Eventually his son by his first wife meets his second son, the two come home and his first son falls in love with his half-sister.  And the younger brother kills the older brother before the latter can marry their sister.<br />That's it. That's the \\"what happened\\" plot but the real \\"plot\\" is in the \\"why happened\\" not the \\"what happened\\".  This book takes us on a breathless journey to the depths of the human heart (a heart corrupted by an immutable caste system) and lifts us up again on a rollercoaster ride that is a bit hard to take sometimes.  It is about the way people think and react; about the way (and the why) they love and whether they acknowledge that love (or not) and what happens as a result.<br />It is about the choices we make once but that happen over and over as though those choices are not and can never be made only once.  And no doubt Faulkner's fear of women is in here too.<br />It's just that this time I didn't see it as much; or perhaps it wasn't the only thing I saw.hing I saw.	2003-08-26

In this book we see the texts from which the Jewish people can construct their identity.  Here is Dickens justifying his demonic portrayal of Fagin to a horrified British lady by saying that \\"Fagin in Oliver Twist is a Jew, because it was unfortunately true of the time in which the story refers, that the class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew.\\"  Or how about this quote from the famous novel \\"The Butterfl\\": \\"The language of the Jew reveals the Jew's hidden character, no matter what language the Jew tries to speak.\\"  And here too is the association of the Jewess with eroticism, with the orient; and of the male Jew with capitalism and with exploitation.  Here also is the image of Proust: a Jew, a Catholic, a homosexual, and a Dreyfussard struggling to also be French; and here is Leopold Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses.<br />These identities, these portraits emerge in a collection of essays by some of the most notable writers of our time; they ask us to think what it means to be a Jew in an European society today-not merely to answer the question \\"Why do they hate us\\" but to try to answer the question: \\"With such a rich tradition of anti-Semitism (for anti-Semitism is woven into the very fabric of European tradition) how can a Jew in a European country have a positive image of him/herself?\\"	2003-08-24

Her diary tells us everything Judy Lash Belint sees just by living in Jerusalem: from the daily terrorist attacks to the water being turned off when she gets back from yet another grueling day of work (in Jerusalem water is rationed and every apartment complex votes on when they will have no water but Judy Lash Balint was not there for the meeting and so did not vote and did not know...) and yet being so tired, no exhausted that never mind she can collapse and sleep without water or a bath or a drink.<br />And from her we hear what it is like to visit a family right after a horror attack.  Vadim was murdered and a Palestinian soaked his hands in his blood and held them up for the cameras of the world to see.  Irina his pregnant wife was watching television and saw it all on TV... and when Judy Lash Belint pays a condolence call and Irina says nothing because what is there to say?<br />And Judy Lash Belint tells us also of the Ethiopian Jews' custom of going up to the Western Wall to celebrate their gratitude for the Torah and she tells us of drinking coffee in a Starbucks and of the regular election debates.<br />The ordinary and the recognizable intermingle freely in these pages with the horrible and the incredible.  It is a book all those who are interested in Israel should read because it tells of one woman's experiences in Israel, in Jerusalem; day by day.	2003-08-24

The amazing thing (to me, an historian by training) is that there is fundamental agreement on the facts. All agree, for example that the Merneptah Stele (a tablet dated at 1212 BCE) exists, that it is Egyptian in origin, and that the Egyptian pharaoh (then the most powerful man in the world) considered the conquest of the land and people Israel the most important feat of his reign. The tablet says as much. But why was defeating Israel so important? A lively debate rages.<br />Likewise all agree that a people called Hyksos came into Egypt and eventually became its rulers starting about 1800 BCE. Yet Hyksos is a Greek term and there is precious little consensus about who these people were. (Aside from the fact that they were Canaanites of some sort.)<br />All agree that there are stones bearing characters that can be read if one is fluent in Hebrew in what was called Raddana once (but is today called Ramallah) but a debate rages about whether these are signs of a &quot;widespread&quot; Israeli literacy or of a &quot;privileged&quot; class. All agree that Israeli pottery, houses, and artifacts are different from the general Canaanite ones and that ancient Israelites were very active traders because their artifacts have been found all over the Middle East and beyond. Yet there is an interesting debate about just what was it that made the Israelites different from Egyptians and other Canaanites.<br />There too is a very active debate about whether Egyptian style houses made their way to ancient Israel or the other way around. And that's just scratching the surface.<br />In short, if you want to know a bit about ancient Israel and Middle East and about the archaelogical debates about both, this is the perfect book to start you on an endlessly exciting road!an endlessly exciting road!	2003-08-24

And since the \\"individual\\" is a Western invention (and since Harold Bloom is unabashedly in love with Western literature) this book is meant to be a kind of beginner's guide to the truly great books in the Western tradition.  This, of course, is a very individualistic guide.  Missing from it, for example is one of my favorite English authors, George Orwell whose \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" if not \\"Animal Farm\\" surely deserved at least a few lines; missing too are the great poets Pushkin, Lermontov, and Byron.  Virginia Woolf's name is mentioned a few times; her books, however are not.  I could extend this list ad nauseum.  But that, of course, is not the point.  This is Harold Bloom's list, not mine; and it contains his breath-taking commentaries that follow one another in a kind of unbroken chain that seems to sing or tremble; not mine.<br />The fast-moving commentaries are almost too much.  I could not read this book in one sitting. Reading about another's perception's of Nabokov and Hemingway and Cervantes and Shakespeare and Milton and Faulkner and Ellison and Morrison (to name only a few of the authors mentioned in these 283 pages) in one sitting is, for me, impossible.  I had to come up for air rather frequently.  I had to think about what I had read; I had to let the words I had heard sink in-for, as Bloom points out, we must listen when we read.  But in the end, I found the book well worth the effort.<br />For this book teaches the patient and attentive reader something few books on literature will: that we should read not out of any ideology, not to better the world but to better ourselves.  Or, as Rabbi Tarphon whose Pirke Abot saying Bloom quotes in his conclusion tells us tells us, \\"It is not necessary for you to complete the work, but neither are you free to desist from it.\\"<br />Being an individual-thinking for yourself--is hard work.  But while we draw breath it is our ethical responsibility to do just that.But while we draw breath it is our ethical responsibility to do just that.	2003-08-18

Orientalism has undoubtedly provided Middle Eastern Studies with a new paradigm-as Edward Said had intended.  The book begins innocuously, giving little indication of the stridency and moralizing to come.  Said proposed that Orientalism he was about to \\"sketch\\" was simply \\"a style of thought based upon an ontological and epistomilogical distinction between the Orient and the Occident\\" (p. 2).  He then brought attention to his fears that \\"distortion and inaccuracy\\" might thwart his account but consoled himself by the thought of the additional volumes that might be written by \\"scholars and critics\\" (p.24).  And indeed this book launched a study of Orientalism Said at first defined as \\"principal methodological devices for studying authority here are what can be called strategic location, which is a way of describing the author's text in relation to the Oriental material he writes about; and strategic formation, which is a way of analyzing the relationship between texts and the way in which groups of texts... acquire mass, density, and referential power among themselves... I use the notion of strategy simply to identify the problem every writer on the Orient has faced ... Everyone who writes about the Orient must locate himself vis a vis the Orient.\\" (p.20)<br />This then was \\"Orientalism\\" and it defines the limits of Middle Eastern studies to the present day.  Yet it is more than a new method for addressing old problems.  It created a whole new set of questions for Middle Eastern Studies and vigorously excluded others.  By strategic formation, Said referred to a way of viewing any text, artifact, or allusion, or even imaginative allusion (see his discussion on Jane Austen for example) to the Orient.  These were a priori objects contaminated by Orientalism.  Said thus has no interest in \\"proving\\" Orientalism; he simply assumed it.<br />But again and again we get back to the question of what exactly is \\"Orientalism\\" for Said defined it in two mutually excluding ways.  On the one hand, he describes the object of his inquiries as \\"an almost unconscious (and certainly untouchable) positivity\\", a kind of opaque object that gave his study focus.  And for this reason, one couldn't simply reduce the subject to a \\"western imperialist plot... a structure of lies or of myths which were the truth be told, would simply blow away\\" (p. 6).  And yet, on the other hand he trivializes the very claims he made by declaring that every European in saying anything about the Orient was \\"racist, an imperialist and almost totally ethnocentric\\" (p.204).  This is then a kind of \\"Just Say `No' to Orientalism\\" message---and yet, if this is the case why not simply declare the whole field off limits?  Why enunciate such a detailed paradigm for Middle Eastern studies?<br />What is \\"Orientalism\\"?<br />Said never provides us with an answer. Yet it is the new paradigm for Middle Eastern studies in our universities.On the one hand, he describes the object of his inquiries as \\"an almost unconscious (and certainly untouchable) positivity\\", a kind of opaque object that gave his study focus.

It is not the memoir of a man whose mother or father \\"had been hauled to a concentration camp\\" (p. 22).  This is the memoir of \\"one of the lucky ones\\" (p.22).  It is nonetheless, a tale of a survivor.<br /><br />It is the story of a man whose hormones forced him, a young adolescent Jew, to look at the hated newspaper Sturmer which portrayed Jews as evilly lusting after pure Aryan girls but which \\"could not leave sex alone.\\"  And while he looked at the images of the dangerous cockroach-like Jew lusting after pure beauties-him-he grew of age.  Is it to be wondered at that he did not, as he tells us, lose his virginity until long after university?<br /><br />And yet, Peter Gay was one of the lucky ones.  He only lost two members of his family to the gas chambers.  Both were blond and, in my opinion though not Peter's, rather pretty.  One of them played Germania in school plays.  The Nazis (or perhaps ordinary Germans? Or maybe Poles, Croats, Latvians?) gassed her.  Peter, however, was not gassed.  He was not even in a concentration camp.  Peter was one of the lucky ones.<br /><br />All he did was live in a world, a Berlin that became smaller and smaller.  Not only could he not do certain things but more and more he could not go certain places, be on certain streets, or associate with certain people.  Non-Jewish doctors for example.  And the radio and announcements and the laws and the newspapers made it plain to him that he, a Jew, was a \\"blot on humanity\\" with whom \\"true\\" Germans should not associate. Gradually, his world became his immediate family and his aunts and uncles.  Gradually, gradually he became a true pariah.<br /><br />Because he had become a Jew by dictat.  For Peter makes it clear that his family was (and took pride in being) an assimilated German family.  They did not think of themselves as Jews or as pariahs.  To them madmen were running their country: Germany.  And they were the true Germans.  None of this, of course, impressed the Nazis and since the madmen had the power, they, the true Germans, had to leave.  With a sensitive boy who was suffering from depression.  A boy who was one of the lucky ones.<br /><br />And finally this is the story of the lucky boy grown into a man; a man who tries to reconcile himself to his Berlin.  A boy/man who wants to desperately say (as did President Kennedy but in proper German) Ich bin Berliner but who cannot quite do so.  A man who still roots for Hertha H.S.C.

By that reasoning, if I were to say that there is peace on earth it would be the case.  Or as Said puts it (p. 144) because certain socio-political-economic powers in the West have a vested interest in a certain image of Islam, \\"those sectors have the power to propagate THAT image of Islam\\".  Thought thus becomes action.  If I think it; it is so.<br />Furthermore, by equating speech and action he has, in fact, denigrated both.  I, personally, find many things Edward Said says about Jews in general and Israelis in particular offensive.  I feel that by saying these ugly things he is drawing a false and mendacious picture of both.  However, I do not feel that because he portrays Jews and Israelis as greedy, profiteering, colonizers, and in general very bad people, he is intent on the \\"conquest\\" (p. 172) of the Jewish people.  Nor do I feel that I can equate terrorist acts with words as Said does in his Introduction when he states \\"Of course there have been suicide bombings and outrageous acts of terrorism, but have these accomplished anything except strengthen the hand of Israel and the United States?... [T]hey furnish an additional weapon in the contest to beat down, compel and defeat Arab or Muslim resistance...\\" (p. xxxv)<br />In other words, on the one hand terrorist attacks are really just words by other means and on the other hand they are, in fact, agents of the Israelis, the Americans and the imperialist Westerners.  Said contradicts himself but does not notice it-or perhaps cannot afford to notice it because any contradiction would bring his totalizing theory crashing down about his ears.<br />For to Said, words are deeds and deeds are words.  There is no difference between the two.  But he does not ask if this logic means that all of us, including Edward Said, must immediately cease and desist from portraying a group-such as Jews, Arabs, Indians or Europeans-in an unfavorable light because there is no difference between speech and action.  If we say or think or imagine a negative thing about any group we, by Said's definition \\"do violence\\" to that group.<br />We are therefore (Said included) precluded from saying-anything at all.light because there is no difference between speech and action.

But it has, as he recognized, obvious relevance to the intellectual climate in the post Cold War world.<br />Consider, for example, this his profound insight that the intellectual \\"protests against police brutality, the inhuman rhythm of industrial production, the severity of bourgeois courts, the execution of prisoners whose guilt has not been proved beyond doubt.... But as soon as he decides to give his allegiance to a party which is implacably hostile as he is himself to the established order, we find him forgiving.. everything he has hitherto relentlessly denounced.

They do not question whether Western democratic values are superior to those of the USSR but whether Western values are superior to those of Mid-East and Africa.  It is no longer fashionable to question whether the way we see communist countries is culturally apt; instead we question whether how we see terrorists is culturally apt.  After all, should we not look for \\"root causes\\" of terrorism?  That question is still asked.  It's just that before 1989 intellectuals asked that question about communist terrorism; today they ask it about Mid-East terrorism.<br />The myth of the revolution has moved to a new continent and intellectuals, the Revolution's devotees, have a new Pope.<br />What a difference a few years make!	2003-08-09

I have been reading it on and off since it was recommended to me about a year ago.  To understand it, you have to be well-versed in Hegel and Foucault and Said among others.<br />But it's a VERY important book.  It calls for a return to historiography in the true sense of the word and an end to the ideal types of Foucault and Said of object/subject; colonialist/colonizer.  Or, as the book itself puts it, what is needed is a study of non-ideal and non-homogenous society but a society &quot;constituted by at least two conflicting traditions.&quot;<br />All our histories are far, far richer than that and to say that all we are is either one or the other (as many of our history departments do) is to do all of us an injustice.

Reality always presents proliferating multiplicities.&quot;  We are not just object/subject or colizer/colonized and to call us by these ideal types alone is to do us all an injustice.<br />This book says that-but in very academic terms.

[This] is not a theoretical insight but a moral postulate... The students, of course, cannot defend their opinion... [but] to their way of thinking there should be no tolerance for the intolerant.&quot;<br />When I read that statement as a student, I was offended.  Later (as I got on in years) I realized what he was trying to tell me.  As a young and idealistic undergraduate I believed that one must stand up for what is right, be committed, get involved, and act against evil.<br />I also believed that truth and evil are relative.<br />I was being inconsistent and didn't notice it. That, of course, is Bloom's point too and he concludes from it that students are in error in their relativism and calls for an education focusing on Western values that will teach them better.<br />I think I was wrong but I would call for an education that would teach students about valid and invalid judgments.  Let's face it: many of the students in our universities are NOT Western and, although it would be good for them (and for us) to learn about Western culture, that is not the only culture out there.  We should all, however, learn about valid and invalid judgments; and we should all learn that it's okay to judge.<br />A valid judgment requires that I separate my own personal preferences from what I judge to be unversal standards.  That's not an easy thing to do.  But it means that I must separate my revulsion from certain foods and customs (say lip piercing) from a woman throwing herself on her husband's funeral pyre.  The first is my cultural habituation; the second a universal value.<br />Yet when I make those judgments I must do so humbly knowing that they are made by MY standards for I don't really know any others.  And for that reason, it would be good for me to learn what those standards are.  It would be good for me to learn Western values.<br />And those, I'm afraid, are rarely taught these days.<br />So I agree with Bloom's starting point but the conclusion he draws from it is perhaps not the only one possible.for me to learn what those standards are.

And, as is true of all Dr. Lewis' works, this one is painstakingly researched and well thought-out.<br />But that is not what makes this book so special; that is not why this short little essay almost warrants five stars.<br />This little book deserves its stars because it is written so clearly and with such gentle humour.  I felt, as I turned the pages, as though Dr. Lewis and I were having a little chat--over coffee or tea.  I felt as though I had gotten to know him a little bit, as though he told me something quietly wise; something I would have to think about after he had left.<br />Not many books about a subject as weighty as History can do that... yet this one does.  I highly recommend this book a true joy to read.	2003-07-31

Or, as Shehadeh, puts it so eloquently a conflict between Palestinians, Israelis, the \\"inside\\" and the \\"outside\\".<br />For me, the most touching moment of the book came when the young Shehadeh heard the PLO radio denounce his father for daring to work for a two-state solution.  \\"A.S.,\\" it declared, \\"you are a traitor, a despicable collaborator.  You want to surrender and sell your birthright.  We know how to deal with the likes of you.  A. S. you shall pay for your treason.  We shall eliminate you.  Silence you forever.  Traitor.  Collaborator.  Quisling.\\"<br />The PLO quite simply could not afford to lose the funding it received from the surrounding Arab states to create a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians and also to ensure that Israel would no longer \\"be the subject of fiery speeches in which the people's rage could be articulated and released-they would be distracted from dealing with all that was wrong at home.\\"<br />The PLO simply could not afford peace because it wasn't being paid to bring about either peace or an independent Palestinian State; it was being paid to keep the Palestinians miserable and angry.  To ensure that the Palestinian plight remained a distraction for the Arabs earning for democracy.<br />Shehadeh's father dared to stand up to the PLO and its backers.  He was murdered.<br />And now, his son is carrying on his father's work.<br />It is our job to make sure that Raja's life lasts longer than his father's.	2003-07-29
