When I first read all the reviews, I thought this might the book of the decade or something.<br />I'm not going to spend time debunking the facts vs. fiction or whether I believe any of what is stated in the book... smarter, more well-read people than myself have done so at great length. However, I am a writer, and so I'll base my opinion the quality of writing, storytelling, plot, foreshadowing, and the like.<br />I could forgive lack of character depth if the writing itself was tight (M. Crichton is the best at that), but its not. There were so many flashback's I often forgot where we were in the story. I still don't know anything about the characters even after finishing the book. Everything about them is told, nothing is shown. It's like being spoon fed pre-digested food; your brain never has to work at understanding them.<br />Part of the problem with writing about secret societies is, well, they're secret. So witholding information in a mystery-like fashion is a bit unecessary... since the vast majority of the readers wouldn't know the first thing about them.<br />Over all, the plot is interesting, but the story is abysmal. When they were on the plane and whats-his-face kept flashing back to his lectures, I actually decided I wasn't going to listen anymore. It was as if Mr. Brown had done all this research, put it in order, then tied it together with a couple of lame characters and then sent it to his editor. But I plodded on, hoping it would become better. I mean, come on, 80% of this book takes place either riding in cars or riding on planes... who would call that exciting?<br />Anyway, I'm probably being a bit over critical, but I've tried for years to break into the 'published' world, and I can tell you if you weren't Dan Brown and this was your first novel, they'd laugh you out of their offices.<br />oh well...	2004-07-12

It is apparent from reading the various reviews that most everyone was looking for something in this book... some found it, some didn't.<br />What I don't get is the people that have negative comments, stating that he's a snob because he could afford to take the time to heal himself. A snob? I read the book cover to cover and I never once got the impression that he was a snob. For christ's sake, at various times he was sleeping on the road, or in at motel six's next to truck stops. Sure, he can afford to take his time, but he is also constantly reminding the reader (and himself) that he can't continue it forever.<br />And I also don't get those that say he didn't go into his feelings deep enough. Huh? this is 460 pages of an open, oozing, wound. And for anyone who has followed Rush at all knows how hard it's been to even get him to emote in the slightest. I can't tell you how insightful this book was. He talks about his obsession with drums... where his inspiration for writing comes from, how he approaches creativity, how he feels about Rush, Geddy, Alex, and others, and what kind of music his likes and dislikes.  My God! What more could you want.<br />Anyway, this is a timeless story of falling down and getting back up. I actually got more bored with the travelogue than I did with the rest (unlike most of the reviewers). And as for his disdain for Americans... have you ever seen some the tubbo's that frequent Reno, Vegas, and some of the other places in the West. Let's be honest, we could all use to lose a few pounds and read a little more from the literary section and not from the Grisham/Clancy/King section. And if I was in his state of mind, I might be prone to lash out occasionally. Not everything is rational when dealing with grief.<br />'nuff said	2003-05-04

Apparently you don't need any of these things to make a book anymore.<br />Now before all you hardcore Ellroy fans get in an uproar, let me say that I've read almost every book ellroy has done (some of the collections from GQ, I haven't picked up yet), so I'm not basing my review solely on the Cold 6K.<br />My problem is that He seems to have lost his sense of telling a good story. And the 'beat' style wording was inventive and powerful when he started it back in the Big Nowhere &amp; L.A. Confidential, but by American Tabloid, it started to wear thin.<br />I just met Mr. Ellroy at a reading here in St. Paul a few weeks ago. I actually enjoyed the beat style when he read it aloud, but when you're reading for a few hours, it just gets old. It seems like he no longer cares if anyone reads his books, as long as they buy it.<br />anyway, if you're a hardcore fan, you'll probably like it, but if haven't read Ellroy before, for god's sake, don't start with this one! Pick up the Black Dahlia or the Big Nowhere, then start making your way to this one.	2002-07-11

It had tight writing, although it was about 50 pages too long, generally well developed characters and a few good twists.<br />However:  It did use the 'brilliant' psychopath theme a bit heavily.  There were a few too many victims at the end.  But I disagree that the teenage daughter's death was unecessary.  It was a direct consequence of another character's action (or inaction) and needed to be there.  Most of the torture scenes are short, without the gruesome detail (ala Hannibal), and are often seen from a post mortem viewpoint.<br />I like that fact that Mr. Mills didn't 'dumb' down the computer jargon and portrayed her as straightforward as possible.  It does suffer a bit from a man writing as a woman syndrome and I think her reactions thoughts sometimes were a bit stereotypical.<br />all in all, a good book	2002-01-03

Everything about this book is predictable and mundane.  There is so much wrong with this book, I can't believe it was ever published.  It just shows you how far the expectations of a the reading community has fallen.  <br />There is a glossary of terms at the front of the book, leading you to think that the author wants you to know what these things are so he won't have to explain them... but then he wastes precious page space re-explaining them... over and over.  <br />Mr. Deaver obviously read a book about hackers circa. 1990 and used that for the basis for every character in this book.  None of the technology is authentic and its chock full of mistakes, outdated information, and just plain idiotic conclusions.  There is actually a page and half explaining how a letter is displayed on the screen.  The stereotypes abound (unwashed, long-haired socially backwards computer geek...), the characters are cardboard and there's not even a mystery here.<br />In fact... I'm going to finsh this review and get started on my own book... it can't possibly be any worse than this one.	2002-01-03

You'll be dumbfounded (as I was) at how obvious some of the allegorical and symbolic elements of your favorite 'sci-fi' was in hindsight.  You'll also feel a bit manipulated, but don't despair... millions have been duped.  <br />Anyway, just as he warns us not to take any of the authors too seriously, you should apply that same logic to his own opinions and just enjoy listening to an empassioned, educated, practiced writer turning a critical eye to the genre we love...	2001-11-09

Let's see... an ex-cop, turned lawyer marrying a mafia princess while still in love with a globe-trotting journalist who's already married to the most famous actor in Hollywood. Sure, I can identify with these people. Despite my hesitations, I gave it the benefit of the doubt.<br />After about fifty pages, I was wishing someone had killed me. Did Mr. Woods used to write scripts for Soap Opera's? Here is an actual line from the book: 'With nothing left to do, Stone reflected.' What? Why would you even write that? I suppose you have to pad the word count for the publisher. <br />There are no interesting characters that aren't stereotypes to the hilt. The dialog makes All My Children look like the West Wing. <br />Its no wonder that talented new writers can't break into the market, .... I was suckered into it because I was desperate for something to read on the plane and the gift shop didn't have a lot to offer.<br />Oh Well, I know I seem harsh, but there should be some kind repercussion for churning out this kind of stuff. Almost everyone else here seems to think he's god's gift to mysteries. Go back to the classics from Chandler, MacDonald, or some new 'classics' from McBain or Ellroy.	2001-09-25

Despite the title, this book is more of a biography of Bruce Campbell the person than the behind the scenes look at a 'B' actor's career.  It takes almost half the book before he gets to Hollywood and by then he's already known for the first 'Evil Dead' movie.  <br />Once he gets there (Hollywood), the book picks up pace and the anecdotes move along well.  I enjoyed all of the info on the 2nd and 3rd Evil Dead movies, the Brisco County, Jr. series info and all of his bit parts.  The 'how-to' section on acting didn't do much for me, but if you're interested in a life in Hollywood, its an informative read.<br />All in all, a good read that unfortunately takes awhile to kick in.	2001-06-27

Like most, I read this trilogy when I was 13 or 14.  It floored me.  I actaully wept when it was done because I already knew ther would be no more adventures for Frodo and Samwise.  I read a lot of fantasy aftwards, but eventually I gave up because every one seemed to copy LOTR in some way or another (some were overt copies like the Sword Of Shannara series, while some were slight variations like the Thomas Convenant series by Donaldson).<br />I am re-reading this edition because it claims to be slightly more complete than previous ones.  This means that some of the 'corrections' contained in the editions from the 60's and 70's have been put back the way the author intended.  So far it has lived up to its hype and I am enjoying every minute of it.<br />If you have never read this series and you consider yourself a fan of fantasy or sci-fi (all the famous 'Space Opera' stories are loosely based on the same story arc), then you MUST read it.  If you've only read it once or twice, read it again and remember what it was to enjoy an 'epic fantasy' for the first time.	2001-05-29

Even Crichton himself says that the book was just an 'experiment' in combining historical fact with a mythic heroic storyline (Beowulf).  Every review here seems to confuse the book with the movie.  The movie was well-written, cast extremely well, and just overall a great story.<br />I read Eaters of the Dead over ten years ago and had a hard time with it (not from a reading perspective, its quite easy to read), because it didn't give enough information to be relevant.  The Journal style writing without any significant dialog made it feel flat.<br />After the movie came out, I couldn't remember all that stuff happening so I re-read it.  Unfortunately I couldn't get the movie images out of my head while I was reading it, which I think is the problem with most of the reviews here.<br />Anyway, it reads quickly, but lacks a certain depth that the movie made up for.	2001-05-16

Parker, the tough, take-it-to-them man from Richard Stark/Don Westlake, is trying to enjoy some r-n-r down south when a bumbling assassing tries to make it permenant.  He learns that the Outfit is still trying to recover from an earlier embarrassment and wants him dead.  <br />This leads to a pretty thin plot about Parker calling on all his professional buddies to put a hurt on the Outfit by ignoring an unwritten rule and knocking over Outfit rackets.  <br />The writing is tight, as you'd expect, but a bit dated (originally published in 1963)and doesn't cover any new ground.  Still, its enjoyable and worth a quick read (its only 215 pages or so).  Bottom line:  Don't expect to be spellbound, but you'll enjoy the experience.	2001-04-09

Kaminsky's Toby Peters is a classic hard boiled detective and lives up to the title in this book.  It has all the elements of a good L.A. noir story and is handled well.  The extra(s) are the inclusion of many historically famous personalities (Raymond Chandler, Judy Garland, Louis B. Mayer, etc.)<br />That being said this book suffers from the same thing all books written about pre-war L.A. by people who weren't really there.  The descriptions and directions tend to sound like someone reading off of a 1940's California map along with pictures from an old Life magazine.<br />Its fast-paced, short, and to the point.

This book is a refreshing addition to a genre overflowing with trite, lackluster efforts.  Elvis Cole and his zen sidekick, Joe Pike are true characters in every way.<br />The thing that sticks out the most is the honesty.  There is no flowery language to embellish weak writing.  This is straightforward, tight writing, very much in the Ross MacDonald/James Ellroy way.  Instead of telling us how Elvis feels, he shows us through his actions, sometimes contradicting what he is saying/feeling.  <br />Some disappointments, though.  Women are pretty much just set dressings here, even to the point where there are sex scenes for simply no reason.  Also there is an awful lot of mudane driving directions, i.e. &quot;I turned on the 101 and took the Echo Park exit...&quot; blah, blah, blah.  That gets tedious and isn't necessary unless you want to have a ten year old idea of how L.A. is laid out.<br />Anyway, great first book, look forward to more.	2001-03-26

I see absolutely nothing of Hammet or Chandler or Hemingway in Lehane's writing (I've read at least 10 books by the three of them so I feel confident in the comparison).  Those three kept their writing sparse, compact, and straight to the point. Lehane's writing is overflowing with extra thoughts, actions, and words in general.  So if you are thinking of reading this because of comparisons to the masters, don't.<br />Instead, this book is more of a fully populated world in which a brutal murder occurs.  we get deep, deep, deep inside the head of every character, important or not, through page after page of interior monologues and flashbacks (a little more so than I'd like, but it is handled well).  The characters get so introspective that occaisonally I had to remind myself what was happening in the story before they started thinking (not a good thing).<br />I gave it 4 stars because it is extremely well written and the mystery is diffused enough so that you don't guess the killer until fairly late in the book.  It was a fresh approach to an over-used plotline.<br />Bottom line:  A good mystery about 100 pages too long.	2001-03-09

Read up on the authors you really admire and you'll run across numerous references to their greatest influences.<br />Also, I'm not a profressional critic, but some very notable mystery/crime novelist were conspicously left off the list.

Unfortunately, I think they wrote a computer program to generate these plots and it makes it hard differentiate.<br />My main problem with it is the characterizations are thin.  I know, I know... so are most of the books out there.  Most people think that biographical information is the equivalent of deep characters, but its not and that's sort of what we get here.  Lots of information about people, some very interesting, but the plot is king here, not the people.<br />Bottom line:  You'll love this if you like plot-driven, high-concept stories with scientific information copied directly out of research papers, where the characters act and react according to the story's needs.  Otherwise you probably will struggle to get through it, wondering why half the character exist at all and why the book is so long.	2001-01-10

Easily the best of the LA Quartet books (Black Dahlia, Big Nowhere, LA Confidential, &amp; White Jazz), although many would argue for LA Confidential.  I found this one more readable because he hadn't slipped into his 'machine gun' style of prose that became his staple in the later two books.<br />A wonderful tale full of gritty characters, authentic locations, and an uncanny intermingling of real-life history with fiction. And only Ellroy could get away with one of his most bold plot twists (I won't spoil it here).<br />If you like gritty detective stories without the dated language of Hammet and Chandler, don't pass on this one.	2001-01-03

This was my third Ross MacDonald/Lew Archer mystery and probably my last.  As with all detective series type novels, they are starting to lose their luster.  As a stand-alone mystery novel it is top-notch in both story and charactarization, although the plot wandered a bit.  I don't have the deep insight provided by the previous reviewer, but I can say that if you like Chandler style LA Noir, this one is as good as it gets.	2001-01-03

I like characters I can Identify with, not super-powered brainiacs who could rule the world if they chose to.  Its hard to identify with ex-navy SEALs who also have advanced degrees in every discipline known to man.  It was like watching an episode of Baywatch where the characters were smart and good-looking.<br />I appreciate that the other reviewers like the fast-paced plot, and it is well written, but the dialog sounds like a bad soap opera (&quot;As you know, Bob, I...&quot;).  It was hard to finish.  Buy it at a discount if you like these kind of thrillers, but if you want characters, look elsewhere.	2001-01-03

Crisp language, tight plots, and geat dialog make for a gripping story.<br />A sad sidenote.  Don't rent/watch the insipid Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward movie 'loosely' based on the book.  Instead of LA they set it in New Orleans and they basically rearranged all the characters into pale versions of their literary counterparts.  Just thought I'd let you know.	2001-01-03

I read both the Alienist and Angel of Darkness and found them engaging, authentic, and incredibly enjoyable.  So what happened?  I think the previous reviewers hit the nail on the head, the plot was laughable, the characters were about as interesting as nails and his version of the future seemed ultra-contrite.<br />As for the prose, did an adverb bomb explode all over his computer?

They way he lets us see through  their actions and dialog what kind of people they are is very refreshing  (most authors today tend to tell us what the characters are  like).<br />However, the plot was a silly as they come and seemed to be there  only to bring the characters together for a climax (or anticlimax in this  case) and bears no resemblence to reality.<br />That aside, it was an  enjoyable read and introduces you to a different character for him other  than Spenser.	2000-08-21

I have read nearly every one of his books, but  this one just didn't cut it.  The haphazard approach of putting together  his essays on popular culture and hollywood with some short fiction based  on a few of his characters from the LA Quartet was too much.  I couldn't  get focused on any of the fiction, and the long winded diatribes on the  vaccuousness of celebrityism in LA (talk about an easy target), together  with an endless, hyper-syllabic dissertation on why the O.J. trial was a  circus (really?) made me long for the end.<br />Don't even check it out of the  library...	2000-08-21

Despite its laid back approach to a mystery, I liked its down-to-earth  descriptions of how the rich think and feel.

This was my first Mosley/Easy Rawlins mystery and I enjoyed it immensely.  It had depth of character and interesting plot twists and turns.  I also  liked the fact that it was a story about African Americans in 1956 Los  Angeles and it didn't rely on the 'N' word for shock value (unlike Ellroy  and a few others).  I think it was a great introduction to the series.	2000-08-21
US	51714757	R97OV6RME4PRO	0385333919	405352304	Be Cool	Books	3	5	6	N	N	Not very interesting...	I'm a big fan of Leonard's, yet I found this book, sort of, well, boring.  The Characters were as vivid as ever, but I felt myself comparing them  constantly to similar characters in his other books.  The plot seemed a bit  contrived and there was no real tension in the book... none.  You know  Chili is the baddest dude, so you know he'll be able to get away from all  the baddies.  No secret there.  We get a little insight into the music biz,  but not enough to make us believe we're privy to anything new.<br />I think it  might be a good book for those who haven't read a lot of his stuff (which  will be the case since its a sequel to Get Shorty), but I found the  Pronto/Riding the Rap books more interesting.	2000-08-21

I liked it because it was a good snapshot of a man trying to get away from his past and start a new life.  However, I only need to read about a few  beers and drinks and drugs and I get the idea... after a while it gets  pretty boring reading the laundry list of drink and drugs Nick is going  through.  Even at only 216 pages it could have been trimmed down.  He  definitely has to learn how to portray women in general and his love  interests specifically. It was almost like he added them later to create  tension, but didn't flesh them out at all.<br />Otherwise, I though it was a  well written, suspenseful mystery with a few twists.  I would buy it at a  discount (which I did), but don't pay full price.	2000-08-21

I, unlikely as it seems, didn't come to Ellroy because of the film version of L.A. Confidential, I started reading him because an awful lot of writers in the  genre admire and recommend his work.  I would recommend to any one thinking  of getting this book to read as much of the &quot;LA Quartet&quot; (Black  Dahlia, The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz) before tackling  it.  I think it makes more sense and is especially rewarding when you see  the direct correlations between what happened in his real life and what he  wrote about.  The police routine in the second half is a bit pedantic, but  I generally skimmed through a lot of it (as I suspect most people would  do).  When I finished it, I immediately pulled out Black Dahlia and began  re-reading it.	2000-03-03

I was summarily impressed to find out he is a favorite author of  the greats like King and Koontz.  I was not disappointed by it at all.  It  had a very thorough, yet concise writing style that is lacking in a lot of  today's horror writers (Anne Rice comes to mind) and I couldn't put it  down.  If you want to see where it all started, here you go.	1999-11-17

I did like the general idea and plot for this book, but I ended up skipping over the constant news clippings/police reports.  After the killer  is found out by the cop in Wisconsin, I almost lost interest.  It became  too strange.  Anyway it wasn't a long book, so its worth a peak.	1999-07-14

I bought Ellroy's book, and enjoyed it immensly, however I was constantly comparing his investigation with some of  the known facts from the case.  There's one point (I won't ruin it by  giving it away here) that came out much later about Elizabeth Short that  sort of invalidates all of Ellroy's investigation, so I probably didn't  enjoy it as much as I would had I not read up on the actual case.  Still I  would highly recommend it as a crime novel, and it ranks right up there  with Chandler and Hammet, only with a little bit of hindsight.	1999-05-25

It all made sense after this book.  I have the priviledge of being married to a left brainer, and I'm a classic right brainer.  Everything in this book was right on the money.  It helped both of us understand some of the  conficts we've had and allowed us to focus on methods of organization and  task assignments that worked for both of us.  If you are a highly creative  person (not necessarily an artist or writer, but anyone who thinks outside  the lines), this is a must read.	1999-05-03

This was my first look at enneagrams.  It makes you realize how pathetic identifying someone as simply a 'Type A' or 'Type B' personality is.  It helped me understand why my wife, whom had been categorized as a 'A' type  would act differently in different situations, while I, a 'B' type would do  the same.  Once you find your Enneagram, you will be amazed at how so many  things will make sense.	1999-05-03

I have to admit Franklet's handling of techno-babble is very good, but I got tired of reading a mini-biography about every character he introduced.  Why does every new author think that we need tons of biographical facts for  every character?  Show, don't tell. Also, I think there was too much  technical info, and even though it was well done, not every reader cares  how a network works. The book was a bit long, but I had a hard time putting  it down.  This book is much better than 'Ulterior Motives' which some  reviewers had recommended and I thought stunk.  A very good first effort,  and I look forward to more.	1999-04-29

I often wonder what other books people read before they read the one they reviewed.  I thought this book was average at best, and at worst I had to struggle to keep  interested.  The plot was the same as ten other novels, the story was so  over-explained as to be ridiculous (this could have been a 100 page novel  and still got its point across).  I will say that the action is well  written, so I suspect that consequent novels will be better  conceived/written.  Its a quick read, but nothing will stick in your head  past the last page.	1999-04-21
