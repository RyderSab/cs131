A business is not a &quot;thing&quot; that can be categorized within a fixed concept. It must be appreciated as an organism which have its own fuctions, but whose nature is defined by other forces such as its costumers, the shareholders and the employees. Therefore, any attempt to understand a business from a single angle implies a failure to understand its true nature, which will lead to its destruction sooner than later.<br />To make a stand before that challenge, Zen philosophy provides several mental tools to surf the paradigms of linear thinking and the reduced field of vision that a particular problem creates for a manager concentraded in the day to day activities of its business.<br />This books helps to ground anyone in reality, a large perception of reality.	2003-07-26

I mean why do they care about my decision. I am not limiting their reproduction options.<br />Obviously their speeches come supported by opinions that they believe to be universal truths, such as: (i) That all only children are ill tempered and problematic, (ii) that they will never learn how to share (iii) That his life will be lonely and depresive, (iv) that they are extremely dependent and some other rubbish.<br />This book with solid research and analisys shows that an only child can be as happy, mature, respectful, caring, sweet and independent as any other kid with sibblings. The outcome depends as with any other infant, in the quality of its upbringing.<br />Futhermore, the book indicates that an only child do have much better chances to grow as a self assured and caring person that those kids with sibblings, because they are hardly ever compared with other kids, they receive much more attention and quality time from his/her parents, jealousy and the quest for preference is basically non existent as they lack of any \\"competitors\\".<br />So if you are a parent of an only child this book provides excellent data and support to send any possible guily trip about your reproductive decisions, and those who feed it, to the trash bin.	2003-07-07

Eventhough their belief system is aimed toward collision, a local shaman decides to help him in his process of discovery of religious rituals and information gathering. However, the monk is surprised by how theorical are the foundations of his faith when he is shown by the shaman that he knows little of nothing about himself, so if he wants to conquer others, the monk must seek within his true nature. It is here were the novel becomes really boring, lacking any type of tension and becoming a bunch of fairy tale stories of ghosts, waking trees, ogers, and other stuff which must surely do not come from the Bristish Museum documents but from the imagination of the author.<br />So if you want to read fairy tale stories, the ones that offered in the children's section of the bookstore are much more fun.	2003-06-01

Since I belong to the 99.999% who do not give a hoot about them this book and the so call relationship of these beings with other transdimensional entities is quite boring.<br />On the other hand it feels highly contradictory with many other principles and opinions that the author teaches in his web page and other publications. Particularly the fact that the world is doomed (including our existence in the afterlife) no matter what and then to claim that every person is sacred and its soul is eternal and a part of God (whatever she/he/it/light or some other category is) so one is forced to conclude that God is also in very serious trouble in these round lands and that its sacred part inside of me or you is also doomed.<br />At the end feels like this chap is as lost (although quite right on his appreciation that we are much, much much, much more controlled that we would like to believe) as everyone else about the meaning of life, the true nature of self, the extent of love, and what wrong with the the dark side if it is also a part of God's plan.

The Narrative technique is spotless; the definition of the characters, fantastic; at some point the reader is not sure whether this is the description of real historical events, because the care placed into every detail its so well tuned that the concept of \\"fiction\\" does not sound appropiate to the work. Additionaly is fascinating to read a Spanish author writing in \\"mexican\\". The great use of mexican slang through the novel shows how deeply the author went to make its characters realistic. While you read you can almost hear the accent of Teresa Mendoza.<br />On the external part, this book also shows you how the war on drugs is more like a cruel and sad game if not a joke that is played by victims, criminals and governments without really knowing why.	2003-05-18

The state of science in the XVI century, the politics of the church on its ever lasting efforts to control the mind of its followers, the everyday life in a Franciscan convent of nuns, the thirst of knowledge of the commoner and obviously a very detailed biography of Galileo as scientist and family man.<br />It must be noted that all the letters which Galileo wrote to his daughter are lost, so the book is built following those written by Sor Maria Celeste to her father.<br />Indeed they reveal the close nature of their relationship, which in any case makes you wonder why on earth, if he was such a &quot;good&quot; father&quot; he buried his daugther in a convent. On the other hand, the letters will not reveal much of his scientific side since almost all of them address menial issues, between them.<br />Oddly enough, this could have been as good as it is without dwelling on this relationship. but then it would have been just another Galileo biography. However, with this book the reader feels like no stone is left unturned to show us how this epic clash of science vs the status quo of the church developed.	2003-02-15

The author provides a soul to each one of its characters, whereby, no matter how dark or alienated it grows, we can still find some simpathy for him/her. Its like a permanent reflection about how fragile we are, how odd is this existence where uncertainty is the only constant feature and why our judgment of others, is a waste of time, because none of us is in a moral ground above the rest.<br />The topic is really a tragedy set upon the 70's India, but made no mistake, it can happen everywhere not just in a far away land. The Patriotic Act enacted by the US Government is not that different from the Emergency Laws of Indira Ghandi, both are driven by the need to rob the individual of its fundamental rights, while preaching that they are doing so for the good of the nation.

Is that the reason why love is a fools game? This questions and several more are placed before the reader while in the surface the tale is just narrating how Herr Cazotte, will try to seduce Ehrengard. Not by having sex with her - that would be to crude and common for an artist like him - rather he will try to show her by means of a portrait, that her inner self was captured by his art in a painting while she was bathing naked in a secluded lake.	2003-02-05

Many attemps, sure, there are thousands of books from religious garbage to philosophy and fairy tales.<br />But the quest, the eternal quest to find something to ground us, to find a point of departure from which all the nonsense, beauty and cruelty we see in life could be explained, is brilliantly assembled in this book, using the inner strugle of Barabbas searching for an answer for the killing a guy called Jesus who died instead go him for no good reason at all. In his search he faces the same stupidity, fanatism, hate and superstition that surrounds the life of that man until today.<br />For the author, the inner pain of Barabbas have not faded with time and nowadays remains as valid as 2000 years ago, when there is no good reason to have faith in anything at all, but to claudicate upon such quest only leads to despair faster that to keep on looking for something we know nothing about.	2002-11-04

Granted, the book have several funny lines and characterizations, but I feel that those who even take a few lines seriously are not very keen into introspection.<br />The book fails to include the view of a single woman on her perceptions about dating. It never mentions that nice guys who are funny, witty and asertive, take to bed much more women that those which are categorized as jerks.<br />The problem for the large majority of the so called \\"nice guys\\" is that they fail to recognize that their sole motivation for being \\"nice\\" is to take a woman to bed. So they try to sell themselves as harmless and honest or use the strategy of \\"best friend\\" to get close while being undercover.<br />Women on the other hand have a great sense of intuition to feel that those guys who portray themselves as \\"nice\\" are just a bunch of sex starved hipocrits, who use a lame strategy to get into their panties and most probably if they lack imagination and self assurance they must be lousy in bed.<br />So the dilemma is not between being nice or a jerk, the real issue is how to express what we want and if the answer is NO, how to move to the next relationship with your self steem untouched.	2002-11-04

The odd part its that we, somehow arbitrarily, decide which of those are important, and when that happens, necessary we miss the big picture. Consecuently our grasp on life.<br />All the characters on this book have decided to make their life small and meaningless due to their lack of awareness. Even those who are cruel, their conduct is a result of their stupidity, more than out of inner evil.<br />Forthe characters in this book the accidental arrival of a baby in their life creates such pressure that just overwhelms their already very thin capacity to repond to changes in their neurotic patterns.<br />As expected the novel is construed upon the consequences of their emocional incompetence and their disastrous results, which at some points are funny. But more than that I agree with other reviewers that the author call upon us to medidate upon our petty obssesions and why, regardles of how important and significant we consider that they might be, the truth is that they are irrelevant and only refrain us from becoming happier persons.	2002-11-02

The line could be summarized as follows: A young Chinese girl is forced to become a prostitute for the officals of the Japanese Army during their invasion of Nanking. The father of girl finds out and kills her Japanese pimp.<br />On the other hand, the 300 pages of the books are just used by the author to show that he knows a lot of vocabulary. Sadly it is used most of the time to take the reader to the arms or Morpheus, not to develop a storyline. Now if you suffer from insomnia that might be a good reason to buy the book.	2002-10-07

They share the same name in memory of her aunt who died when she  was very young. One is an artist (Big Elsa) which is quite grounded and the other (Small Elsa) lacks a purpose in life. Out of that condition, becomes a member of a sect, and as expected from that type of congregations, ends up becoming a sex slave and losing the little sense of self she still haves within her. However, out of that vacuum she becomes aware of the falsehood of those persons who sorround her and scapes deciding to confront her oppresors, denouncing them to the Courts. Out of the confussion cased by the identical name, the cousin also becomes a target for the members of the sect. Situation which forces her to scape her town and all that is familiar to her. Frustrated also because it was not clear to her why was she being prosecuted, making her escape sort of ridiculous before others and herself.<br />Knotted on this framework, the novel also goes back in time to explore how the grandfather of the cousins, was displaced externally and internally from those aspects of his life that were dear to him, and how for every one of us, no matter how well we can remake our life after a loss, we can not exclude it from what we are and what we will become and how, either we want it or not, we pass that loss upon our succesors.	2002-10-07

Here when the humans find the way to travel through time, the desire to change the past is a by-product of such discovery, so the group of The Guardians of Time is created to precude distortions in the known time-line as well as to explore other possible developments that could have taken place.<br />The four short stories in this book are construed over the same premise and using the same lead character. The chosen events are: (i) The british isles in the XIX and V centuries; (ii)Greece in the III century B.C; (iii) California in the XIII century and finally, (iv) Rome during the Punic Wars.<br />Its obvious that these periods were choosen by the author out of his personal preference, but not because the felt that they were particularly important on the overall development of known events.<br />This is not a particulary interesting science fiction novel to have unless you are a hard die fan of Mr. Anderson.	2002-09-30

The author does not claim that the victims of the American Airlines Flight 77 who took off from Dulles Airport are false, or that we shall not join the grief and anger that the events of 9/11 brought to US citizens.<br />What the author argues is that departing from the physical evidence gathered at the Pentagon as well as from the graphic documentation of the crash, indeed a huge explosion occurred at the Pentagon. The problem is, that such evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that such damage could no be caused by a Boeing 757 travelling at a speed of no less that 250 mph.<br />Indeed, looking at the reasoning of Mr. Meyssan and the evidence he places before you the reader feels at loss to explain how the crash of the Pentagon would be the only case in the history of aviation when after the collision not a single piece of the plane is recovered because all the plane is melted in an explosion, which oddly enough does not affect the green grass on the field right in front of the building. Or how a plane of that size and with such a wide wing span makes a crack on the building which is al least 50% smaller that the size of the plane. In other words how is it possible that the wings and the motors did not touch the building? Or how a plane of that size and characteristics gets into the most heavily guarded air space of the USA and no single civil or military radar cares to wonder what is it doing there.<br />Mr Meyssan feels that such lack of coherence of the official version with the stark reality of the facts only proves that the US government is knowingly lying to its citizens in order to hide that what really happen on 9/11, including the destruction of the twin towers was a coup d' etat by the industrial military sectors of the US, covered up as a Muslim conspiracy against the US, in order to gain sufficient support from its citizens to attack Afghanistan and Irak and make a [heck] of a profit with the blood of honest, kind, patriotic but misguided Americans, while simultaneously gaining absolute control of the petroleum of the region.<br />If he is right or not I do not know, but indeed the absence of a single piece plane debris, together with the photos that the damage suffered by the Pentagon do not have the scale that should occurred if a real Boeing 757 had fallen against it makes you uneasy about how right Mr. Thierry might be.nest, kind, patriotic but misguided Americans, while simultaneously gaining absolute control of the petroleum of the region.<br />If he is right or not I do not know, but indeed the absence of a single piece plane debris, together with the photos that the damage suffered by the Pentagon do not have the scale that should occurred if a real Boeing 757 had fallen against it makes you uneasy about how right Mr. Thierry might be.	2002-09-10

Maybe future readers will feel that is a bunch of rubish and that the nature of the character is not that of the hero but that of an obnoxious artist. The same way some people see today Robinson Crusoe as a repelent friend of slavery.<br />Judging the moral merits of a novel more than 300 years after it was written is sort of futile because we can not demand from the author to be attuned to the cultural beliefs, world views, literary technique and metal structure of today's reader. But all the critics of whether it is fun to read or not, are perfectly valid, since being entertained is powerful reason to pick up a book at any time in history.<br />Now, for me Robinson Crusoe is a great book because it can be read at several levels, that is for some people is just the story of a guy stranded in an island. For others is a parabole about the reediming power of the faith. Some see an existencialist struggle between the freedom of the individual versus the complex workings of society and not few percive a shameless propaganda for white supremacy and slavery, and will gladly have the book banned as compulsary reading in schools.<br />The fact is that by the end of the XVII Century, a writing of this characteristics was unknown, nobody wrote like that. Such spark of originality is recognized and deserves attention, because it creates a turning point in the history of literature. If for today's reader is fun to read or not, that is really another issue. As you will see for many of Amazon.com's reviewers the answer is quite extreme between the opposites of 1 and 5 stars. I invite you to know why.	2002-08-26

Firstly because he feels that the love of music does not have any need of it, and secondly out of the failure of his first marriage, largely as a consequence of his wife obssesion with it, and its willingness to ignore and set aside all persons who might interfere with such purpose.<br />Then, while he feels at ease with himself,  and nothing new seems to occur in his life one of his new students will propel him again the the world of performances and the slavery of critics with painful consequences.<br />I give it five stars not because it is a great piece of literature, but the author do have the power to convey how for someone whose life is truly absorbed by music and the pleasure it provides to our soul, even when arbitrary persons and absurd emotions cloggle their everyday life, music will provide unshakable foundations to return them to their center. The dialogs are a secondary issue, because music is the only &quot;feeling&quot; that truly matters and it does not need success to exist.	2002-08-19

As everything in life nothing is black and white and indeed Mr. Grisham does a superb work showing how in life nothing is what it seems in the surface. Granted, he relies to much in coincidence to explain parts of the plot, but what the hell, the reader knows it is buying a shallow work, not a Pulitzer Price masterpiece. So that sort of happy go lucky developments are to be expected.<br />In any case, the book provides what it offers, that is, a very interesting novel in which the reader is hooked to the book to see how the main character Patrick Lanigan, whether a crook or not, works his way out of the mess he and his girlfriend are in. Since the solutions are not made out of bullets, kicks and fists, but out of sheer strategy, it is almost impossible not to feel a large degree of emphaty with Lanigan.<br />Some people wonder why shall a &quot;thief&quot; be the hero of the novel. Well, (i) Lanigan just wants to beat the system (a very strong need in all of us) and (ii) most of his actions are oriented towards self defense against other persons who are  essentially dishonest.<br />However, the last two pages of the book are not really necessary, they do not make the plot smarter, are difficult to encopass with the smart personality of Mr. Lannigan, and are not made for this type of novels. They are a BIG mistake by the author.	2002-08-03

He strongly feels that the state of the house is the consequence of the moral decay of its owner who is a good for nothing, solely interested in hunting activities and who had a bastard son with the maid of the house.<br />The priest believes that the sacrament of matrimony, will render the fruits upon Se&ntilde;or de Ulloa soul and sets hmself the goal of finding him a bride suitable for such high designations. The Marquis due to quite distorted reasoning ends up choosing a cousin who is not very attractive and a little weak istead of the one he was really attracted to.<br />The aims of the priest clash head to head wih the long term plans of Primitivo a sort of family housekeeper with a self appointed position who have been stealing the proceeds of the hacienda's and is waiting for the proper moment to take full control of the Marquis de Ulloa's land properties. At that moment will become due when Spain is shaken by liberal movements and the novelty of the democratic process.<br /><br />The role of women on this novel shall not go unnoticed, since both the maid and the aristocratic lady of the house are also a reflection of the era which is gaining momentum Spain and it is reflected on the health of both ladies and in which the Spaniars were simultaneously spectators and protagonists as well as in the sexual preferences of the Marquis de Ulloa.	2002-07-23

Here we have a guy who was trained to not think by itself while believing that he does. All the nasty effects of conformity and its permanent conflict with social ambition are perfectly displayed in a humorous tone with makes the satire of the author even more piercing.<br />While Babbitt struggles to find his place in the web of social fabric, he also is feeling lost about what is his role as a family man and what is the sense of coming back each evening to a boring and fat wife, who also happens to care for him. He is also boring, bald, ugly and fat himself but incapable to perceive these facts or at least acknowledge them. So, to a large degree he feels that life is unfair with him.<br />This explosive cocktail takes him in a quest to figure out what is he really capable of and to demand from existence what he believes it owes him.<br />While the reader accompanies Babbitt, he is easily submersed in his skin and laughs at him. Here is were the author does the magic trick and before you know it you are not laughing about the character misfortunes but to our own lack of understanding of everything. That is what this work a fantastic piece of literature.	2002-05-30

He was changed not simply by the horrors he saw but also by an unexpected and unasked glimpse about the eternity of the universe and futility of human might.<br />He perceives that all that can be said about where we come from is condensed in a rock. The odd thing is that a stone is something that nobody pays attention to, but the whole meaning of existence is hidden on it and it cries to be understood.

Still, the images and too frozen and it feels as a way of life that happened a long time ago but no longer exists. Actually the contrary is true, the Parisians are incorporating their dogs into their lives more closely than ever.

In this case, my rating is based on the simple fact that it is a simple plot with simple characters for those moments when you want fun, simple uncomplicated reading. In other words, this is not the type of book you suggest as a program for a reading club, but you will enjoy it in an airplane if the in-flight movie is too lousy to watch.<br />An the plot?

And why is it that the lack of understanding with the members of the opposite sex is such a source of anguish and pain? A genetic drive is not longer a workable explanation because the fact is that we are not desperate to cover the surface of the planet with more fellow citizens.

So here the couple feel that their existence is boring and meaningless, but if we look closer the reason for their drama, it is never really brought to life by the author. It does not seem to me that she wants to denounce anything in particular about human experience in suburbia, or to open the mind of the reader to issues that somehow live hidden before our daily lives. The burning of the house is an empty act that leads nowhere. To some degree it was not even necessary for the development of the story.

Although hate for the enemy is not exactly an absurd feeling and it can not be denied that in 1945 the German civilians were not considered an innocent party in the confrontation.<br />Furthermore, it can also be argued that the end everything that we do lacks a real sense of purpose, basically because the reasons we believe are ours have been acquired from someone else (our culture) and that includes giving up our life in a war, choosing a profession, or electing the next weekend movie.<br />For me this book superficially remind us that we spend our life sleeping while simultaneously being awake, but that if at some point we take the time to look at our thoughts we might be able to get unstuck from the situation in which we are living and really be an independent person.<br /><br />On the other hand this books makes you smile once in a while but is not hilarious.	2002-01-31

Otherwise, neither being owner of the biggest vessel in the Mediterranean or the CEO of corporate USA will be of much use to build a feeling of success.	2001-12-25

If you read it, is usually just because it fell on your hands during a raining afternoon, in which you do not want to watch T.V but you do not want to think about any complex issue either.<br />Here the KGB have discovered a system, whereby the mind of the president of the U.S.A can be pushed towards emotional reactions that will obliterate its rational capabilities. On the other side, the U.S.A. governmental agencies do not have a clue of what is going on. So as usually happens in these books the job to figure out what is going on follows upon the shoulders of a disappointed CIA employee recently divorced, with a big belly, highly critical of its employer but with a great drive towards individualism and imaginative thinking.	2001-12-09

So much, that life becomes uni dimensional. And that is precisely the reason why I rated it with only three stars.<br />The events,  the characters, the drama, the mental scenery, all about this book is circular, without colors, plain. If you read 100 pages or 400 pages it makes no difference, the action just stand still so much that this book can also be summarized as &quot;Azaro goes into madam Koto's bar - Azaro gets scared - Azaro leaves madam Koto's bar\\".<br />After this situation had happen 15 times, in 300 hundred pages, there comes a point you wonder why the author does not use his imagination and writing skills to lead the novel somewhere aside from the events in madam Koto's bar, in which invariably, the patrons become weird spirits or someone gets into a fight forcing Azaro to leave the bar. In other words this book is very boring.	2001-11-21

However, Ms Dillard proves such belief wrong.<br />This is  an odd book, because you can read it in any order that your fancy takes you. At the end it does not make any difference if you start in a paragraph in page 80 to continue then on another on page 24. Seems like a summary of observations and thoughts. The funny thing is that in this pilgrimage to the farthest reaches of the universe, the purpose of nature, the existence of beauty and other mind breaking topics, she hardly moves a mile from her home.<br />For me it is a clear statement that to understand the nature of self and the inherent truth of creation you do not need to travel further that your backyard. Just stop and see. Nature talks to you if you care to listen. Nonetheless, bear in mind that its speech will always surprise you.	2001-11-13

What makes this book so special, are the very numerous testimonies of the soldiers that live through such nightmare, without forgetting to tell the reader about the big picture of what was happening in the halls of Washington and Tokyo. I give it four stars because due to reasons only known by the author, the testimonials of the Japanese soldiers are almost non existent, so a very important part of the history (the other half) is excluded an that is absurd in the case of a 600 pages book.	2001-10-15

I started reading this book not being to sure about what I was doing, since to know about the habits of these primates is not exactly among my list of favorite topics. So I just started browsing and before I knew it, sixty or eighty pages had gone by as well as my possibilities of getting up early in the morning.<br />The author will guide your through the complex social structures in which chimpanzees live to the very detailed and amazing details of their everyday life. For example that they would eat gladly a human baby if given the chance. But more important she makes you care for their lives not as a consequence of a higher scientific purpose, but simply because the more that we relate to nature the more we are embraced in its blessings.	2001-07-31

His sort of intimate life viewed through the imagination of the author. In literary terms is not a masterpiece, and at some points some of plot gets weak but as most of the reviewers have said, Mr. Jennings provide you with all the elements so that you can visualize those times almost effortless and that alone is worth the reading. During few passages I was annoyed by the lack of respect he shows for some of the cultures and religions. For example the mocks the people of India as being lazy and of poor hygiene, while forgetting that the Europeans new very little about personal tidiness well into the XX Century. Those minor points aside, do not withdraw from reading it just because of is size, most probably you will be so entertained that in a few weeks it will be over.	2001-07-26

Therefore, there must be other previous books that explain his change of  sexual preferences and activities. (I do not know their titles)<br />That situation, will not preclude you from enjoying this book since it have a good suspense and have characteristic not easily found in most &quot;bestseller&quot; type of novels. Here the good guys are not really that good, and the people from the mafia simple criminals, but the author does not give you specific reasons to feel aversion against them. As a result, you might find yourself wandering why you care at all if Tom Ripley and company can succeed in their endeavors. But you do!!! This made the novel particularly interesting for me.	2001-07-07

Obviously, this book conveys more suggestions to attorneys that for any other group of professionals. However, it can also be of help to people involved in activities far apart from a court of law, like  a soccer player, or any other person interested to know about how to gain communication skills.<br />The chapter about how to deal with confrontations in the work environment is quite lousy, maybe because he is not a company employee, but labors solely for his independent clients.	2001-06-23

But the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; seems to lack a clear motive. Some may argue that is the quest to be immortal but even immortality must have a purpose, otherwise, why bother to achieve it.<br />I was also troubled by the apparent circumstantial events which lead to the connectivity of the characters. It felt to forced and artificial, and the author is aware of that that is why he tries to explain it as pre arranged destiny. But again, if someone can dispose and control at will others even when the parties involved do not know each and live in different continents, then why does it need to enact a charade to achieve its goals?<br />That is why, when I reached the last word of the novel, interrogation signs appeared all over my mind, and although I enjoyed the suspense, I truly did not get what this book is about.	2001-06-23

Accidentally, the doctor that is treating him mentions, that such person looks very similar to another doctor who is currently directing a clinic for the very wealthy, in Geneva. Obviously, the detective can not let his old instincts go and decides to unmask the war criminal by himself.<br />As a thriller, this novel is not particularly good, but the author uses the plot to try to unravel what sort of character could become not just mass murderer but worst, a person that tortures his victims for pleasure, How is it possible that pain can become pleasure under a logical perspective? The answer will not be settling.	2001-06-10

The same can not be said for his moral coherence. The portrayal of the British mercenaries and colonizers as humanistic and concerned for the welfare of the territories they attempted to control vs the solely rude and money minded Dutch, is one of the most shamelessly one sided characterization of events I have read in a long time. Besides its thesis of how Captain Courthope &quot;changed history&quot; is a funny isolation of all persons who simultaneously were living their imprint in history so that that the events that lead to the exchange of Manhattan for the islands of Indonesia, could take place.<br />However, if you approach this book without reacting emotionally to the myopic patriotism of the author and its absurd disregard for the rights and historical perspective of the natives, which were equally murdered cheated and dispossessed by all the european powers of that time you might enjoy it.	2001-06-03

Love is supposed to be unconditional, then you find out that lover has been involved in tragic, dramatic crimes, which can hardly be explained. Then, is it wrong to love that person? Are the acts of a person the same thing as the person? If we can always be defined by our actions, and what we do is contradictory, then what are we? Can any one really judge anyone? And if we judge how do we really know that we are viewing the situation form a superior moral stand point? And if we can not judge, them how can we relate to life and others? How can we evolve as better persons without a before and after to compare? How do we know is better? Is someone who kill one thousand persons worst that a person who kill one? Why? Can really life be quantified?<br />The questions which that came to our mind are certainly not limited to these few, but the intensity of the work and its basic humanness will certainly touch your heart.

But I find that effort to be fun, if the language is there, we better make use of its full extension.<br />However, it is true that many of the descriptions used by the author seem to lack a purpose and that they are being used solely to build pages into the novel.<br />The author also needs to master the techniques of suspense and momentum building, because you hardly feel immersed in the sufferings of the characters. Except for Ruby all of them are so plain that is difficult either, to reject or support them. This lack of resources is so sad, that even when Inman can finally undress Ada, after four years of being thinking of her every moment, the author describes such episode with the same lack of intensity that a couple of 37th years of marriage have when they go to bed after arriving from work.<br />I guess this novel won the National Book Award because the juries felt impressed by being forced to used the Oxford's Dictionary.	2001-04-29

Nevertheless, if you have found contradictions of some of its ideas, he makes a good effort to simplify a little more what he have said before so that those doubts are brought on the open for discussion.<br />I just regret that in some chapters, the system of questions and answers lacks continuity and seem too prepared so it feels that the answer was written before the questions was posed.	2001-04-29

You do not need this book to understand such very basic advice. Besides we all know that sharing is good and being respectful to others is desirable.<br />In other words you might have more fun and less consumption opening a fortune cookie and reading the little paper inside.	2001-04-04

Regardless of the very witty paragraphs ,and very funny situations that you might find in this book, I completely fail to see any coherence in the underlying drama. So an entity called Sunday decided to confuse six policemen and make each one of them appear as anarchists to the other, so that those same six guys will somehow be able to discover that they were in fact policeman is far from logical but them, to create another situation by which they are induced to follow him after an elephant and a balloon, then enter a party that could also be confused by an LSD trip, for the sole purpose of help them make sense of their lives is simply absurd.<br />You really do not know if this a suspense story (a very bad one if that is the case) or if it is really into social satire (then the books becomes much better)or if this an under cover new age novel for those with esoteric inclinations (there I do not know how to judge it, that is, he might be mocking all those with ideas about the existence of supreme beings, or he could be supporting those beliefs, but this book was written in 1907 and only until 1922 he converted to Catholicism).<br />The fact is that the author was well aware that many of his readers were clueless about what this book was about, so he kindly remembered them that the original title was &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday.

Among the many topics which this novel is about, this one seems to me the most striking one.<br />Timothy is a young fellow, with a very conservative father. The latter is afraid of modifying its daily routines and by the same token, is having a hard time understanding why his children will want something different of life than what he suggests. Not even the war changes him a bit.<br />Nevertheless, Timothy is willing to take risks although pushed a little bit by the example and funds of his sister, who left the family house to join the US army as a secretary, and is not willing under any circumstances to return to the dark and humid rooms of her home or the supervision of her parents<br />When Timothy arrives to Germany a country which was ten times more destructed than England he is shocked not only by the affluence of material goods that he can find in the US Army camps located there. He is also surprised by the spirit of its people. Willing to forget the past, and more than that anxious to lift its country from the bits and pieces that remained. While England although it won the war, remains a place were its politicians are unwilling to recognize that life will never be as before and for the same reason seem incapable to react and find solutions to their lack of material wealth.<br />While living in Hildelberg, Timothy will find not only that he alone is capable of directing its life but also to understand the basic need of freedom that guided the acts of his sister.<br />Those are reflected in the abandonment of its catholic affiliation, her economic independence, her flirtations with several guys at the same time and finally the taking of a casual lover.<br />What surprises Timothy the most is that she is not broken by this open defiance of family and British social rules, but actually that her life is fun, fulfilling and more interesting.<br />And when he synchronizes in the same frame of mind, life also opens up for him.e frame of mind, life also opens up for him.	2001-02-10

While I do not think that this book have embodied any kind of social message, it satirizes everything from family, the army, politicians, education, wealth, prestige etc.(Actually religion is left alone). Wilt is a professor at a polytechnic who like to think of himself as a humanist, and a no nonsense guy. Nevertheless, when female student dies of an overdose of heroin he becomes the main suspect of the police as being a provider of the substance.<br />While Wilt is oblivious to the fact that he is a suspect, the police department assigns an overachiever inspector to solve the case, who in its eagerness to catch who he believes is the biggest drug pusher in the county. Logically, Wilt will continue with is everyday life, that for some unknown reason refuses to be calm and quiet as he would like, forcing him to act in an awkward manner. The police inspector puzzled by his behavior  ends up breaching every possible law of privacy with the most hilarious results a reader can expect.	2001-02-10

The characters are forced by the circumstances that surround them to be involved in situations which in principle do not concern them  (A lot of Indians or Massais could not care less if the Germans defeated the British in World War I or viceversa but they have to fight in a conflict without a clue of the reasons behind it). But for the main characters of the novel, such unseen force is the same one that will lead them to explore aspects of their life which they did not even know that existed. The perfect example is how Pipa found his wife and the subsequent birth of a son who will follow its roots eventhough he is not aware of them.<br />Our existence is fun, tragic, confusing, arbitrary, ambiguous, etc. and for the same token many aspects of this novel follow the same pattern. The most important ones are the many unfinished events, which by the simple force of inertia find an opportunity that will make sense at least for someone, later on.<br />The author seems to remind us that life will always surprise us. It is simply to ample for anyone to imagine all the possible outcomes.	2001-01-10

It is hard to imagine that a family group like the one to which Karim belongs actually exists, and at least for me that is one of the reasons why is quite difficult to take his &quot;sufferings&quot; seriously. Actually it seems more likely that Karim took the approach of being an spectator of his own life. For example he is bisexual but his ambiguity in tastes does not create any sort of moral dilemma, and the events are taking place in the late sixties, early seventies, when for someone to express openly its non heterosexual tendencies could be very risky, moreover when his fellow school mates were a bunch of racists rednecks.<br />My feeling is that the author just want to convey that a world in which the social rules and parameters are always changing is more exiting than frightening no matter in which social group you belong. After all life is meant to learn and which courses you want to take is to a large extent only up to you.	2001-01-04

It shows with amazing beauty how life is more powerful than death. How every time a person picks up an arm to impose its ideas, he is merely a tool for the dispensers of stupidity.<br />I do agree completely with the other reviewers who have stated that this book can not be approached believing that is merely propaganda against Israel.

But what a stupid ending, if feels like she reach the point when she got bored of writing 700 or more pages and suddenly decided to end it. The worst part is that the nature of the secret this novel revolves around seems very interesting and suddenly it happens to be of such inconsequence that will hardly explain who why some intelligent people believed that  owns it will rule the world. Actually who ever ones it is screwed.<br />The worst part is that she portrays the nature of characters such as Napoleon Bonaparte (Who by the way I just think was a bloody creep, who hardly provide any benefit to their fellow men but who is protected by the nationalistic good press of the French)as a cowboy in a funny hat. That is simply ridiculous.<br />And the son of the heroin during the French Revolution, what was his role? None. Nevertheless the author uses him to create an expectative that is never accomplished.<br />And the romance between the American and the Russian is so cliche that makes you feel embarrassed on behalf of the author.<br />If you want to read a good novel, regarding the real &quot;importance&quot; of being immortal go and read &quot;All men are mortals&quot; by Simone de Beauvoir&quot; It is just fantastic.

No matter what the author is describing that object, view or event is fully colored (even if it is a dark room) However, Ms. Michaels concentrates so much in style and detail that at the end she loses the big picture.<br />For example, nothing was added the storyline by suddenly taking Jakob out of it, and placing an admired or his works, a complete stranger to him who out of nowhere is given full access to his house in Greece.<br />Why does this mysterious character suddenly abandons his wife of whom he is in love? Moreover when the person who was captivated by Jakob personality is she and not him.

Esta novela es un perfecto g&eacute;nero de romanticismo, no simplemente por ser una novela &quot;rom&aacute;ntica&quot; sino porque tenemos a un personaje dispuesto a perder su vida antes que vivirla renunciando a los ideales artificiales que se ha creado sobre ella.<br />En este caso particular, el Joven Werther sufre y es bendecido con una gran sensibilidad que al tiempo que le permite vibrar con cada peque&ntilde;o detalle cotidiano, le impide relacionarse con los dem&aacute;s de una manera que sea indiferente a sus personalidades. L&oacute;gicamente su vocaci&oacute;n de solitario sufrir&aacute; un shock cuando encuentra una mujer que, aunque prometida para casarse con otro y por lo mismo, fuera de su alcance debido a las convenciones de la &eacute;poca, le mueve el piso de manera tal que toda su energ&iacute;a vital la dirige a lograr su atenci&oacute;n y dedicaci&oacute;n, aceptando anticipadamente su destino al fracaso, pues aunque la desee, debido a que ella es su imagen de la pureza y la nobleza, si lograra su objetivo destruir&iacute;a su ideal y con eso la esencia misma de su b&uacute;squeda.<br />Por ello al colocarse en una situaci&oacute;n en la que solo puede optar por el desenga&ntilde;o o el sufrimiento opta por este &uacute;ltimo.<br />Como los suicidios por amor no han pasado de moda y tristemente a&uacute;n son muy frecuentes los est&uacute;pidos que los practican por esta causa, la trama de esta novela a&uacute;n puede acompa&ntilde;ar emocionalmente a uno que otro lector de este siglo. De hecho Goethe se esfuerza en justificar la conducta de su personaje durante la novela cuando le hace afirmar:<br />&quot;N se trata, pues, de saber si un hombre es d&eacute;bil o fuerte, sino de que si puede soportar la extensi&oacute;n de su desgracia, sea moral, sea f&iacute;sica; y me parece tan rid&iacute;culo que un hombre que se suicida es un cobarde, como absurdo dar el mismo nombre a quien se muere de una fiebre maligna&quot;.	2000-11-06

Manolo is a born loser, in every possible aspect of his life, incapable to consider any possible positive outcome to a situation. He lives several steps below the poverty line and his life circles around a group of people who are also miserable and without a possibility of redemption (or at least that is what they believe).<br />Simultaneously this characters spend most of their working days in hotel bars (how they pay their bill the author never bother to explain)and drink champagne in the mornings. So you are left wondering if they are so miserable how come they live the bohemian life of a depressed rich boy.<br />Everything in this book is sordid, it lacks any entertaining or literary value, and what its worst lacks any real insight into the lunatic nature of its characters.

However, the  book provides a pleasant read.<br />Maybe at the time that this novel was  written, when the contraceptive pill had just been released in the market,  and some catholic couples were struggling between common sense and the  stupidity of the Vatican in terms of family planning, the book was cleverly  mocking those captured in such particular doubts. But now when such dilemma  is largely ignored by any couple with its feet on the ground, the absurdity  in which the plot is founded loses strength.<br />The same happens regarding  to the other topic which is the mockery of academic research. Nowadays very  few people will spent one or two years buried in a library looking for  informationWe have the Internet. However most of the funny events occur  while Adam Appleby is at the library of the British Museum.<br />In other  words if you are looking for a book to laugh until your ribs hurt better  spend your time with &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; or also with a  book written  by Tom Sharpe.	2000-08-28

So if you are looking for an additional reason to buy it, I encourage you based on the fact that it allows your mind to  wonder in that place where everything is possible and exciting. The power  of the images created by the words you read will make you wonder why on  earth, we have chosen to go to sleep watching the news on television  instead of being glued to a book, which help you to create a wonderful  world for yourself.	2000-06-29

To my surprise this work is much more that what I bargained for. Eventhough most of the issues discussed herein involve deep philosophical  and scientific issues, from the fields of chemistry, physics and biology,  Mr. Capra does a superb job placing difficult concepts at a level, that any  person with a basic level of education will understand him. What is most  amazing is that he hardly falls in the custom of explaining through  metaphors, which usually misleads more than explain. On the contrary, he  carefully selects the words and phrases so the reader will not be left  behind or fall asleep.<br />The best way to summarize what this book is about,  is by using the author's words:<br />&quot;My thesis has been that a theory of  a living systems consistent with the philosophical framework of deep  ecology, including an appropriate mathematical language and implying a non  mechanistic, post-Cartesian understanding of life, is now  emerging&quot;<br />And guauu, this guy is a great advocate of his case.	2000-06-19

Undoubtedly, the precision to detail and the smoothness  used by the writer to convey its ideas is fantastic. My problem with it, is  that the drama in which the love story is build seems rather silly. We have  a character like Gatsby who is a young fellow who decided to become rich  the fast way (smuggling and other unidentified dirty business) to gain  social recognition for the sole purpose of being worthy of a rich girl of  whom he had fallen in love. Nevertheless, the author never takes the effort  to outline why in ruthless 20's, when wild capitalism was on the rise and  pragmatism was the only name of the game, a person like Gatsby,  who is the  living symbol of those forces,  who have laid more women that he can  remember and who have \\"known the world\\" from every possible angle, decides  to waist his life in pursuit of a romantic love and challenge the husband  of her beloved with the tact and style of a 14th year old. Such situation  just takes away all credibility to the drama. I guess the novel became  important for the reasons so many of the other reviewers have expressed. He  provided a frame of reference for the people of the 20's to perceive their  own time.	2000-06-19

However, upon finishing it became evident why the adaptation was  not something difficult. Each character is extremely rich in human  complexity and the author dedicates most of its effort to unveil their  soul.<br />The same happens with all the stories. However in each one of them  its end is somehow bewildering because they lack a conclusion. Is like  going to the movies and having the film ending with a &quot;to be  continued&quot;. I guess McCullens want to convey the idea that at the end  of the day nothing finishes because life keeps on going on.	2000-06-11

However, if you are in the mood for paradox and descriptions about the parallel lines that are drawn in the author life  between his inner quest (enlightenment)  and its outer quest (to find the  snow leopard in the Mountains of Northern Nepal) is very probable that you  will find this book interesting.<br />It is true that the book is written  with elegance and style. Nevertheless, I wonder if the author wanted to  reflect its tempo the geography of  Nepal, since it is full of up and  downs. In other words, in the same chapter one paragraph could be bright  and full of details, wonderful clever ideas and suddenly without any  transition you stumble into the most boring and superfluous descriptions.  Therefore, if you are into wildlife studies leave it aside, but if you want  to hear the traveling record of a Zen student you might enjoy it.	2000-05-29

It seems clear that the author does not give a hoot if the reader believes her or not. She just want to relate very funny and amusing  situations which she has gone through, the nature of her magic and some  very interesting explanations about white and black magic (no formulas or  spells are enclosed as addendum). From then you might draw your own  conclusions.<br />Mine remains the same. Life could be very amusing provided  you always remember that when conclusions are established, you are running  the risk to stop learning. My warm regards to Ms Bourne in case she still  around this planet.	2000-05-29

Tal vez lo mas impactante es como el autor pone de presente que la  bondad cuando se funda unicamente en la inocencia, no es una virtud.<br />La  novela es magnifica, pues a pesar de que no ahorra esfuerzos en hacer  sentir al lector lo enajenante que puede ser para el esp&iacute;ritu un estado de  perpetua violencia,  al mismo tiempo le resalta al lector como la belleza  siempre est&aacute; ante nuestros ojos sin importar las condiciones, solo es  cuesti&oacute;n de sintonizarnos con ella.	2000-05-07

It is clear as daylight that the way we feel about issues and persons bears a direct influence on how we act towards them. This book stress the fact that if we want to live a fruitful  life, we shall pay close attention to our feelings as well as to the  emotions of others. Only then we will acquire the mastery required to  function with ease in society. A person who is understood by others will be  trusted by them, and understanding someone is not just an intellectual  effort, it is also the capacity to relate oneself to the mental state of  that person, i.e. its emotions. Such feast can only be done if we develop  our emotional intelligence.<br />I guess this book will not tell you something  you do not know, but it will open your eyes about the fact that your  emotions are within your control, and that if you pay attention to them and  their underlying forces a new dimension of possibilities appear in your  life as well as in the life of those close to you, particularly, your  children.	2000-04-25

Here the main character, Yossarian, is someone who recognizes that absurdity has become a way of life for a world were logic reasoning has been twisted to support a group of persons who could not care less about their fellow beings.<br />The problem  for someone, as him, who suddenly becomes &quot;enlightened&quot; is that  he can no longer be understood. Besides he can no longer be in communion  with life as it was before. From that perspective everything that occurs  becomes absurd, and what is absurd is usually funny. Here is the strength  of the book, it proves that once you can laugh about the situations you are  living, you are in control of your life andabove those persons who try to  keep you under their grip.	2000-03-25

You wish, when you read books of this type, to be looking at events that no longer can take place in this planet, that hate for the sake of hate, and greed to obtain authority and power, are matters of the past. Sadly,  even when a person like H&ouml;ss who truly believed to be a decent human being,  places before your eyes his dark side, in an attempt to explain why he  became what he became, you still can not understand which is the side of  the conscience that shuts down to consider normal the destruction of other  beings, just because a leader or a newspaper says that we shall hate  them.<br />The world is so estrange that right now, after the Jews suffered  such terrible prosecution and destruction, many of the now citizens of  Israel do not have any inconvenience to kill, humiliate or exploit their  fellow neighbors and bothers of Palestina, just because they are afraid of  them. H&ouml;ss was also afraid of the Jews but such fear does not justify his  actions. Why do we still believe that fear is a just cause for our abuses  is something that neither this book nor any lecture about political  struggles will show us. Only if we look into our heart we will found out  that fear is an unfounded emotion. Therefore, also all the actions based on  it.	1999-12-25

Indeed, the  methodology adopted  by its authors to present their arguments is superb,  and their demise of meditation, exploration of  feelings, emotions and  intuition to discover the nature of reality is quite convincing.  Nevertheless, it left me anguished, since from their conclusions, the  reader could infer that man is just an evolutionary accident and as such he  is just subjected to a series of mechanical laws, without any interest or  regard for the world of ethics and  values. Therefore,  the meaning of life  is something which can be dictated according to its rational needs. In  other words that meaning does not respond to an \\"adaequatio\\" to a higher  plane of reality. On the contrary, meaning is something artificially  adopted by people and societies if it is convenient. Luckily, I found this  book by Mr. Schumacher, who with even higher elegance and spotless  reasoning explains why reason is not the only tool that could lead us in  the right direction if we decide to find what is Truth.  I certainly leave  to the author to explain his point of view. However, I will allow myself to  quote a small paragraph of his book which for me is a very good guide of  what is it about.<br />\\"Experimentation is a valid and legitimate method of  study only when it dos not destroy the object under investigation.  Inanimate matter cannot be destroyed, it can only be transformed. Life,  consciousness, and self awareness, on the other hand, are damaged very  easily and almost invariably destroyed when the element of freedom inherent  in this three powers is assumed to be non-existent. It is not simply  the  complexity at the higher Levels of Being which invalidates the use of the  experimental method, but much more important, the fact that causality which  rules supreme at the level of inanimate matter, is at the higher levels  places, in a subservient position; it ceases to rule and is, instead,  employed by the higher powers for purposes unknown at the levels of physics  and chemistry\\".d, but much more important, the fact that causality which  rules supreme at the level of inanimate matter, is at the higher levels  places, in a subservient position; it ceases to rule and is, instead,  employed by the higher powers for purposes unknown at the levels of physics  and chemistry\\".	1999-12-11

When a lost manuscript that Ravelais wrote to Parcelsus  reappears in the state of a Millionaire, just to be immediately stolen, the  reader might believe that the recovery of such document, is the core of the  drama. Not really, it is a little element that puts the novel in motion, so  that the writer can display very eloquently, why the existence of wit and  humor depend on the tendency of human nature to mess up any type of idea,  be it a complex issue such as the existence of God, or the if a particular  color is fun to wear.	1999-11-08

All the pages of the novel are washed away describing inconsequential conducts and behaviors. I fail to  see anything funny or at least an issue worth discussing with a friend, let  alone explain to him/her what the book is about. Its theme is actually  about nothing. Indeed my feelings for this book contradicts the  enthusiastic reviews offered by other fellows, and I am surprised because  some books which I have bought from Amazon.com based on the popular opinion  have not disappointed me. Well, I guess there is always an exception to a  rule.	1999-10-06
