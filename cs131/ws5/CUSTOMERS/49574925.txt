If you wish to learn the tone of our country after WWII was declared this would be a good book to start with as you learn of preparation and training of war only through the passing of trains in a small town named North Platte, Nebraska.  You learn of the love expressed by many toward the boys that had to go to war through a 10 minute or so visit in North Platte.  Many a lump was formed in my throat because of nostalgia as I lived through those days.  The change in our country from then to now is dramatic.	2003-03-11

Backbone is the word of perfect description.<br />This story is also for the aspiring attorney as the myriad of details and layer upon layer of fact gathering gives you the complexity of law-giving.<br />This is also for the true crime addict who soaks up the doing of the dastardly and derring do.  In parts the story is quite clinical, but the human interest is more overpowering and the results of lying is most compelling.  A good read.	2003-02-17

This is such a book.  You learn of the special relationship that twins enjoy (and infrequently &quot;not enjoy&quot;)and the rest of us mortals can only read about.  You learn of their life while a youth in the beginning, but the majority of the story  concerns the illness of Marty.  You learn a lot about bone marrow transplant and it is interesting.  Marty is ill over a long period of time and the many procedures and decisions that have to be made are sometimes overwhelming.  This story will keep you interested from beginning to end.	2003-02-09

You learn of the big difference of the society in Hungary vs America; it is great.  Andy Grove achieved great success, but you must read this book to discover why and how he did it.  It was all due to personal determination and you learn of the setbacks encountered during his journey to adulthood.  A fine read of inspiration.	2003-02-05

Fear is the overriding force that each citizen of Guatemala lived with during these times.  Over 200,000 people (not the military) were killed ... the supporters of the army and/or guerilla side.  <br />You learn of what happens when a dictator is the ruler of a country and/or the military has all the political control of a country.

I will read his other books now with the background given in this book that sets one up to know more about his stories and how they relate to reality.  <br />There is a lot about basketball here, but it adds to the intensity of the story and points out his yearnings that are thwarted by his father and basketball coach.  He rises above all his heartaches and succeeds multifold in my opinion.  This is a wonderful book and should inspire you to work hard in accomplishing goals and surmounting all types of problems.  I am not a sports fan (excepting the baseball world series and football in the Rose Bowl New Years day)yet enjoyed this tremendously!	2003-01-15

The story starts in the era of the early 1900's and goes up to the present.  The author's mother's name in Chinese means Wild Swans in English hence:  reason for the title.  Ms. Chang's parents were high up politically in China and she did get extra favors during her life, however, there was a lot of suffering goin' on due to Mao's policies.  How a billion people can get sucked into ravaging a country points out the importance of educating and training the youth...properly with high values!  This is one fine read.	2002-12-30

I was engrossed throughout by reading about a young black man who wonders how he can make something of himself and get out of the poverty and life defeating stream of his life in New York City.  He comes across the idea of being a stand up comic and this is his story of how he accomplishes his goal.  The author uses big show biz names which is woven into the story in a most effective way.  You wonder if Jackie Mann was really a part of the history of comedy during the 50's and 60's and beyond.  You will not be disappointed.	2002-10-08

This book gives descriptions of the battle event that was reponsible for the medal for a number of  veterans from the Civil War through Viet Nam.

It does appear many of the TV shows are most autobiographical and you learn about his friends in real life.

The author is a good writer and as he lived the subject matter, we are led into the life of a wannabe fighter.  I was totally unaware of the positive side of boxing and realized far more athletes in hockey, football and auto racing die or become maimed than in boxing.

His acting talent is self explanatory and the force of his book is not in the entertainment realm, but in his personal evaluations and description of the highlights and lowlights of his life....so far.

The construct of this story was unique (for me) as each chapter was specifically about one character in the story where you got to know and appreciate every single person involved.  It was a great innovation to me and helped in the development of the story.  <br />This is a true-to-life story of what happens to individuals and families when infidelity occurs that disrupts the lives of many people and puts them on the avenue of chaos and doubt.

The field reporter is constantly trying to keep out of the way, yet reporting on what is happening on the battlefield.  The reader is right in the thick of battle and is party to the success and failure of events as they unfold.

From poverty to great wealth based on musical talent of creating songs as well as a wonderful actor.  He had many highlights writing songs and acting but after rock &amp; roll took over the musical scene his talents went for nothing as no youth were interested.  <br />Mr. Sudhalter covers Hoagy's entire life and an interesting one it was.  The writing in many places is of a &quot;text book&quot; nature, but the content of relating Hoagy's life puts the reader in the center of life as it existed in the 20's through the 60's.  Apparently Hoagy's type of music is gone forever which is a loss without question.  New generations continue on and what was usually stays behind as merely history.	2002-04-25

It is a time consuming endeavor and one that requires truckloads of money at (great) risk.  Mike Medavoy &amp; Josh Young make their story interesting from beginning to end and talk more of the business end of films as that is Mike's expertise.  There are a few stories about stars, but primarily it is the problems encountered in making and financing a movie.  I learned a lot about the film industry which is now approaching an entirely new way of doing things as regards the technical composition (digital and computer enhanced)as touched on at the end of this book.  This is an intelligent and interesting book about filmmaking.	2002-04-19

I haven't read a mystery for many decades and this was a good read as I finished the book (which is a good sign), however, felt the evil one(s) were not much of the story.  There are about 4 characters that are well developed and the rest are in and out.  There is a part in the book where a Doctor takes Anna Pigeon on a date and shows interest in her.  Then Anna discovers he is into pornographic pictures and drops him like a hot potato. I did not discover where this added to the story and felt it was left in limbo.  I would not rate this over 3 stars.	2002-04-09

This would be considered true crime, however, any suspense is non-existant as the author only talks about one suspect and no others so you know from page 5 who the culprit is.  If others were mentioned as to rape suspects and a little bit of history given to others, then it might have been more interesting.  <br />The interesting part of the whole story is how the culprit leads two different and distinct lives for a period of time and then how his personality begins disintegrating toward the end and the ruse used to get a confession out.  The major victim is given a roller coaster ride that is heartbreaking.	2002-03-28

This book is what you are looking for.  A true story of majestic proportions that create throat lumps every once in awhile.  If these mentally challenged children that don't know the meaning of self discipline can find within themselves a goal of monumental meaning whereby they change their entire life in a period of about a year to compete against two hundred other students and accomplish fantastic results then you can do the same for yourself.  The story ending is one that make dreams come true because of what has happened before.  Don't miss this one!	2002-03-24

If 50 to 75 pages of this type dissertation was edited out, it would be a much better story.  The religious nature of both primary familys' is very important to the story, however, it is overdone.  While reading I was comparing the American Indian's religious beliefs (which I love) along with the Mexican Indian's outlook.  Quite the same in many ways, particularly when actually changing from human to animal form and then back to human.  Fascinating.<br />I read this book out loud to my wife and she also enjoyed it and would most certainly recommend this being a fine reading experience, however, she also agrees there is too much philosophy given by Dona Guadalupe, Salvador's mother. Her meanderings are important to the story, but you can pass by many paragraphs when she gets too wound up.	2002-03-21

The author got her idea from Monty Roberts (on her own by the way) who wrote a wonderful book about horses.  Most anyone should be able to follow the instructions as encompassed in this book as attested to by other critics writing with Amazon here.

Great reading!<br />This book is about a black man named William Henry Sheppard A/K/A<BR>The Black Livingstone...for good reason.  Others complain about using conjecture in writing this story, however, the author, Pagan Kennedy, admits there are huge holes missing in the life of William Sheppard and I believe she did a fine job in telling this story.  To make it interesting she just had to use conjecture or there would have been no book.  There are plenty of facts, however, to prove that a whole lot of life-threatening danger was involved and original exploration and pathfinding done by the Black Livingstone. <br />This is the story of a black man's life that started as a nobody, then through hard work and some chicanery became a sought after celebrity and then in the waning years again became a nobody.  <br />The relationship between Sheppard and his wife is an interesting one.  All of her life she dreamed of living a certain way and after MANY decades she finally realized her dreams as outlined in the epilogue.<br />This was a fine book for me as the author did well in assembling the information at hand.  I had never heard of Sheppard and the others in this story and am glad I read it!	2002-03-08

Apparently this is the 5th book she has written which takes a lot of work, know how, and perserverance.  She was literally frightened of her own shadow and would allow...and even requested battering to prove how non-deserving she was as a human being...plus trying to commit suicide a few times.  The title is apt as her dog Katie is what holds her life together and apparently &quot;the only one who understands her&quot;....until she meets the right man.<br />The story is distressing and points out what a little...strike that...what a lot of cosmetic surgery can do to enhance a personality.<br />You should never be bored reading this book as I read this story out loud to my wife (who is very difficult to please as to books) and she was as pleased about the story as I.	2002-02-17

I surely appreciate the U.S.A., but find it somewhat difficult to understand the preference of living in Africa and foregoing all the amenities offered in &quot;more civilized&quot; territories.  There is a charm in the telling of this tale and also a sharp edge of living conditions that I would not wish to put up with.  The author does well indeed to keep things interesting.

It seems all the top people in G.E. are all MBA's and are talented far above the madding crowd.<br />You feel the effect of smallness in about the largest corporation in the world.  The way Welch describes the various parts of General Electric, each unit is a &quot;small&quot; business by itself [ of course they are NOT small, but seem that way in the description of development]and growth by the executives are described in detail as to how accomplished and where the CEO fits in to the G.E. picture.<br />I was out of my league as to abilities in business and education, but learned a lot of the details of big business.

I always check with Amazon critiques regarding all the books I read and usually attempt &quot;5-star&quot; books only when reading novels...and most of those I seldom finish.  Well..I finished THE LAST CITY ROOM and enjoyed every page.<br />The characters are developed where you care about them (even the bad guys...to get their due)and the events and personalities are interesting and true-to-life.  On one side the reader can see where a reporter could be a celebrity type person where they are in the spotlight and then again the job could be filled with drudgery and danger....as well as low paying to the extreme.<br />This story depicts the times of the sixties and many of the events that went on at that time.  For me the &quot;flavor&quot; of a newspaper job was well developed as was the personalities of many of the characters.  I don't believe anyone would be disappointed with this book.	2002-01-13

From young manhood on his life is so outstanding it is difficult to believe....though I do so explicitly!  This Polish Jew escaped from being in the ovens of the holocaust 2 or 3 times and those events are page turning.  Then he becomes instrumental in the French Underground during WWII and has many harrowing experiences.  Then he becomes a soldier in the U.S. Army (never yet being in the U.S.)and is instrumental in interrogating German prisoners...then develops an incredible program for learning foreign languages.<br />[....]P>This book was so good for me I couldn't keep it to myself so I read it outloud to my wife and we both enjoyed it immensely.

This is telling the reader the result of what happened to 3 chums living in Hell's Kitchen in N.Y. after they did an innocent prank to a street side vendor selling hot dogs and why and how it changed all of their lives.  They are sent to a boy's school (as they were in the &quot;13&quot; age group)and the experience in that institution was just awful.

The ups and downs are most interesting to read about and particularly the experience of Wolfgang Puck (a good personal friend)starting his first restaurant in L.A. along with his Significant Other and the tribulations to get the business opened.<br />You probably will want to read the whole book after you hear this appreviated rendition; it's a winner from beginning to end.	2002-01-07

It seemed there was no editor involved.  Yet, if the sentences and grammer were more refined, then the reader wouldn't get the proper impact that develops as the story unfolds.<br />No one could make up this story.  It is told with as much sincerity as one could give which adds to its interest and belief of reality.  The events are of a dysfunctional family for sure that practices terror by the adults and eventually gross disappointment by the siblings.<br />This life story is certainly interesting where one could say, &quot;and there, but for the grace of God, could go I&quot;  because it probably happened to many uneducated families as to the treatment of their children and the selfish attitudes of most involved.  <br />I started reading this to my wife and both of us enjoyed the book thoroughly.	2001-12-24

Apparently this is the first book by Nasdijj and a winner it is.  His vocabulary is outstanding and the force of his words are delightful.  I did not realize what a alcoholic mother does to her forming baby, but it is terrible.  Nasdijj lived in abject poverty and pulled himself up by the bootstraps by teaching at a college from time to time.  He doesn't go into any of his accomplishments and I am sure that would make a fine story if told by him.<br />This could be a very quick read, but you do slow down as you wish to savor his thought process.	2001-12-03

It points out the complexity of humans and many of their foibles.  I read this book because of the 5-stars I noted on Amazon when I found the title elsewhere.

Usually foreign phrases and words turn me off, but when the Iranian is speaking and uses a foreign word the author immediately tells you what it means; that I was thankful for.  The Iranian speaks different than the female caucasian and the two different outlooks on life is certainly worth the reading.  For me the ending was quite implausable, yet didn't interfere with the story overall.<br />As with most fiction (I do not read that much fiction anyway) there are holes galore at the end with a few sprinkled throughout the entire story.  <br />I read the whole book which denotes an interesting story as I won't read a book that doesn't hold my interest.	2001-11-03

This book explains in simple detail what an Indian is about as it is written from the viewpoint of a 6 yr. old.  <br />Indians are purely physical as to their world makeup and they know what nature brings them and how it protects and feeds them.  They also have a deep spiritual awareness that includes the ability of animals to aid in their daily life and help them in many different ways.<br />This book does not go into some of the complex issues of Indian philosophy, but introduces one into the reality of life as ascertained by most Indians.  A short read and one most worthwhile.	2001-08-10

Poor writing is also a comment; I would say it is good, but certainly not great.  I believe emotion got in the way of some of the mechanics of writing yet this is a fine story that does get confusing at times.  The royal treatment in the beginning juxtaposed with the status of a criminal the rest of the way through the story gives a riches to rags flavor.  There is tragedy and raw survival and during the escape section, real excitement that everyone should find well worth reading.  <br />One also better understands the social and family relationships of the middle eastern society as related in Stolen Lives which is very different from the West.	2001-08-10

This book should hold you 'til the end as it has WW II action in the part of the world that was not as publicized as others; love stories that are heartfelt and point out the difference between men and women and a gutsy author who beat the probability of death many times.  She was the only female in the French Foreign Legion and her tale is one you will not soon forget.	2001-08-06

Because the Chinese society is so different from the western world I have read many books about the Orient and have enjoyed most of them.  This would rate right at the top as regards what's happening in China as of today...2001.<br />Great insight is relayed by the author as to the character and mores of the Chinese individual and points out that each individual is unique...and different...even in China.  The government &quot;line&quot; is strictly adhered to as regards politics, but other areas of life are also different than ours.<br />Peter Hessler gives us an excellent picture of every day life in a most interesting and loving way and I could not put the book down.  This is about life in a tiny spot on the map which is part of a billion souls nation and the interests of all concerned.  Peter makes a name for himself by winning a foot race which sets the reader up to get the &quot;inside story&quot; of many things.  A grand read.	2001-07-31

It is a pro-life story filled with land mines.  I was most interested in the relationship between Milly and Morton as there are many parallels in my life to how M &amp; M &quot;operated.&quot;  One example is almost each day I ask my wife if I have said, &quot;Have I told you how much I love you today?&quot;<br />How Milly and  Morton met and then their courtship is worth the price of the book alone.  The incidence of Parkinson's and the progression of the disease and what was done for counteraction was most interesting.  Then the details of how political it is for getting funding for various diseases was eye-opening.  Then, the final stages of Milly's dilemma is heart rending. <br />Through everything the love between a man and a wife and along with that, the love of a multitude of friends and their support is enlightening and satisfying to the reader.  <br />I read this book in two days; many others could get through it in one.  Easy to read, with interesting information on every page, this is a book that will lighten up your life!  Many times you will say, &quot;I'm sure glad that  hasn't happened to me,&quot; or you could say, &quot;I was just diagnosed with Parkinson's; hope scientific research find the cure within the next year or so.&quot;	2001-07-28

Here a young girl talks of her life in the jungles of the Philippines living with her parents in a remote area where they manage to keep away from the Japanese all during the war.  Thankfully, her father stored a large amount of food and supplies that lasted them during most of the duration.  The heat, the rain, the floods and other calamities kept the enemy away from the remote area.  <br />So this is a story of a primarily safe existence during a time of danger.  Don't expect an exciting story fraught with dangerous happenings as it wasn't that for me.  To be sure many hardships were experienced, yet, a young girl was not privy to the probable dangerous experiences of the adults....if there were any.  The author's much older brother was somewhere unknown all during the war and no one knew if he was captured by the Japanese or even if he was still in the Philippines.<br />This would be a grand story to read aloud to a youngster, male or female as plenty of things happen to keep their interest.	2001-07-17

Uncanny really.  This is still an adult book for sure, but filled with circumstances, thoughts, and memories of a typical 10 yr. old.<br />Your interest is sealed in every minute as you want to know what is going to happen next.  Jenny is most resourceful and how she carted furniture, a bed, and other items for about 12 city blocks all by herself is a wonder.  If a hole exists in this story, it would be &quot;why didn't her brother help her?&quot;  A fine reading experience is guaranteed for all.  I am overjoyed when I read the author is now writing a sequel to Blackbird.  BRAVO!<br />Why did I title my review &quot;Counting Steps...?&quot;  You will have to read the book to find out; 'tis most appropriate.	2001-07-13

The only reason I am giving this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is not an &quot;easy&quot; read.  A good read for sure, just time consuming.  Author Bird talks about Iran like it is a benign, peace loving place you should not be concerned about.  I personally don't hold those views, but it is most interesting to read why the author does.  In fact the reader is impressed of how the Iranians (most of 'em) love the Americans.<br />You get a lot of interesting history and how the Iranian citizen live their daily lives.  Family is truly the heart of the nation and large numbers of people participate in social events within broad family members.  People help each other in many different areas and they more or less ignore the government in many ways.  One weird thing is that the whole country hires &quot;dress police&quot; where fines and arrests occur if you do not dress properly (particularly the women)according to the government.  Citizens rarely rat on each other due to the wonderful social graces of the population.	2001-07-04
