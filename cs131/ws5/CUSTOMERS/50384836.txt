The pages are large, the text is big, the illustrations are very colorful. The stories are easy to read. It's so less overwhelming than the average history textbook, and presented in a much more interesting format. <br /> <br />It starts with the theory of early Americans coming over the land bridge from Asia. However, it presents this as FACT, rather than the theory it really is. Just recently, human fossils were found that proved humans were in North America 50,000 years ago - long before the last ice age began (which I believe was about 13,000 years ago.) <br /> <br />That's always been an irritant to me - books that present theory as fact, without giving kids the opportunity to judge for themselves, or even allowing them the possibility that \\"the teacher\\" might not know everything! <br /> <br />The book doesn't give much to 20th century America - and it focuses very heavily on Indian affairs. In fact, the second half of the 20th century is covered in only about 30 pages.  <br /> <br />There is an unusually high percentage of text devoted to causes that normally don't get so much attention. For instance, the Vietnam Memorial gets 5 pages, and Exxon Valdez disaster gets 5 pages - but there is NO mention of Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Clinton, or either George Bush!  <br /> <br />It's definitely not enough for a full years' curriculum, but a good book for any student who is shy of history - because the stories really are easy to read and nicely illustrated. <br /> <br />Each section has interesting but not really educational activities (draw a mural about life in America, write a message in Morse code) but doesn't contain tests, essays, or other difficult tasks. <br /> <br />It's labeled for grades 3 - 5, but I wouldn't give it to the average 3rd grader, due to the reading level. And for children older than that, this is only supplementary or remedial.	2005-02-19

I did not get a good science education, therefore, in teaching my own kids, I normally let my husband handle ALL science instruction! <br /> <br />He has had this book since he was a kid, and I have found it VERY helpful to my own understanding of physics. <br /> <br />In reading this book, I have come to understand that the science classes I took skipped really basic stuff, which left me dazed and confused. This book is helping to un-confuse me! <br /> <br />It starts with the most basic of scientific principals - matter and measurement. Did you know that the standard yard is the distance between two scratches on a metal bar kept by the English govenment?  <br /> <br />This might seem trivial - but I realized I had never considered that there would need to be some standard that could ALWAYS be referred back to. <br /> <br />Of course the book covers motion, levers, gravity, electricity, and light. Each subject is broken up into small sections that make the information easy to digest.  <br /> <br />If you can get your hands on this book, I do recommend it - whether you're a scientist or not!	2005-02-19

However, I really like this one. <br /> <br />This book gives great historical and cultural information, which has really helped my understanding of the New Testament. I realized, when reading this, that there is a lot more to understanding the New Testament than I had gotten from just reading the Bible. Without the historical background, some things just didn't make so much sense. And the entire story was sort of flat for me before. <br /> <br />I really appreciated the comparative look at the books of the New Testament, and the perspective given on the authors and the intended audience. <br /> <br />Of course this in no way replaces the Bible. But it gave me an understanding I NEVER could have gotten by studying the Bible alone!	2005-02-19

I'm not one of those people who can figure out how tricks are done just by watching. I have to read a book! This book is great, full of very easy to understand illustrations. <br /> <br />Besides card tricks, it covers tricks with money, the three shell game, torn paper (magically whole again), vanishing salt shakers, etc. <br /> <br />This book alone is enough to make a great magician out of anyone! Enough tricks here to entertain an audience for a very long time.	2005-02-19

There were some things about this book that bothered me, however. <br /> <br />From the start, the heroine and her sisters are at what I thought was a tea room - drinking tea and eating pastries. Then one of the women is asked to DANCE. That seemed odd. <br /> <br />The heroine dates - as in going on dates to restaurants and parties with a man.  <br /> <br />Maybe that was done during this time period, but I don't think it was done by members of the England upper class. <br /> <br />The story is written in what I've come to think of as a Regency style - but it takes place in the late 19th century. <br /> <br />I did like the characters, but did feel that they jumped into bed too quickly and too casually.  <br /> <br />That sounds like I didn't like the book - but I did! The writer has a very smooth style of writing. I did enjoy the feminist viewpoint - it was refreshing.	2005-02-19

(As happened the other day, when I read that Ben & Jerry's was naming an ice cream flavor in honor of Michael Moore.. I thought, \\"really???\\") <br /> <br />That said, I must say that they didn't seem to pick the funniest stories for this calendar. Some are simply hilarious. Some are just sort of cute.  <br /> <br />The funny ones, however, are worth wading through the \\"so-so\\" ones.  <br /> <br />Just be prepared to not want to tear off any of the pages! They're too good to throw away! <br /> <br />Today's joke is: \\"Weird Coworker Apparently Likes Walking Two Miles to Work Every Day\\". While it's cute, I didn't find it hilarious. <br /> <br />However, one very funny one has the headline, \\"Pepsi CEO's Wife Buys Coke When She's Mad at Him\\".  <br /> <br />I guess it's like SNL - it's not all brilliant, but it's worth watching because you know something brilliant is going to happen at some point, and you don't want to miss it! <br />	2005-02-19

Parts of this book were hard to read - I definitely wouldn't call this light reading! Details of the crime committed were hard to read - I cried a little while reading it! <br /> <br />This book really is about the white/black relationships in the deep south a few decades ago, as well as the story of the trial.  <br /> <br />I found the details interesting - I was very involved in the story, and really cared about the characters. Unlike \\"The Jury\\", this book is much more emotionally intense - much more about the characters, and less suspenseful. <br /> <br />The plot was interesting - I had no idea how it was going to turn out, which is pretty typical for me when reading a Grisham novel. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite books by him.	2005-02-19

Nations can fight. <br /> <br />Most people get wrapped up in trying to figure out \\"what went wrong\\" when often it is very simple - there is a 3rd party making things go wrong. <br /> <br />Like the gunmaker that supplies guns to both sides - the French AND the English - there are people who feel they will benefit if two other people or groups are at odds. <br /> <br />Anyone who has watched a soap opera for a few weeks can see how this can play out between individuals. It is very clear on the soaps.  <br /> <br />In real life it might be harder to spot the person who has an investment in the disagreements of others. This book provides data about how unresolved conflicts come about - and better yet, it provides the SOLUTION to these problems. <br /> <br />My husband and I were having some trouble, and we used the process in this booklet - it worked! We both discovered that a \\"friend\\" was not very friendly, in fact. She was creating upset in both of us - and creating conflict. <br /> <br />Once we spotted this, using the tools in this book, the disagreements ended! <br /> <br />This is an amazing tool!	2005-01-31

It CAN be difficult for the layman to read.  <br /> <br />This picture book helps to clarify the main concepts in the book. By itself, it is a good education in the mind, and how it affects the spirit and the body. The resolution for problems created by the mind (psychosomatic illnesses, phobias, irrational emotional responses, etc.) are presented in \\"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\\", but the basics behind it can be read in the Dianetic Picture Book. <br /> <br />I recommend this to anyone who has had trouble understanding Dianetics and wants to learn more about how the mind affects the body and spirit.	2005-01-31

I gave The Complete Tales of Winnie-the-Pooh to my older daughter for her 10th birthday. She reads portions of it to her younger siblings. This is one of her favorite, most cherished books.<br />Don't be deceived into thinking that Pooh is just for toddlers and pre-schoolers. The humor is very intelligent, and the characters are just plain wonderful. It is written in a very British style, which I think makes it a great introduction to English literature for children.<br />This is a true masterpiece, and would make a good gift for anyone who truly loves good literature, no matter what their age.	2003-10-22

I've seen reports in the news in the past few years, that show that new research indicates that one's mental state affects how quickly healing occurs. I'm sure you've read them - older people with a pet at home recover faster from stroke. People who laugh often are less likely to have heart attacks. People who get hugged every day heal faster from certain illnesses.<br />Well, the idea is that the mind is a very powerful thing - that our bodies are affected by our state of mind.<br />This booklet gives these actual techniques you can use with someone who has been hurt, to help them with the mental and emotional affects of the illness or injury. <br />I'm telling you, these work!<br />These methods are called assists. My favorite assist is called a Locational. The technique is detailed in the book - exactly how to give someone a locational. I use this one on my children pretty often. <br />You know how kids sometimes will get upset about something, and stay upset for a while? For instance, a toddler runs across the room and falls down. Then proceeds to cry - for too long. You know he isn't really hurt, he's just upset. What do you do to help him get over it?<br />Well, I would give my toddler a locational - and by the end of the locational (usually less than a minute, in this kind of situation), he is laughing and happy! <br />My kids don't get sick very often, but when they do, we give them assists. They've learned to give them, too, and will give them to one another. They heal very quickly. When my youngest had RSV, a potentially deadly illness in a child his age, we gave him an assist in the hospital. <br />He was really sick - we took him to the emergency room when he developed a sudden fever and was having obvious respiratory problems.They transferred us to a larger hospital less than 2 hours later, as he wasn't responding to medication (his fever kept climbing - was at 104, and despite treatment he was having more difficulty breathing). It looked very scary, since nothing was helping him.<br />As soon as we arrived and got him settled into the emergency room at the second hospital, I gave him an assist outlined in this book. 20 minutes later his fever was suddenly GONE and his breathing was totally normal. The doctors were very surprised. They had him stay under observation for 4 more hours, then released him. His fever and other symptoms never returned.<br />The techniques in this book do not heal the person - but they help his state of mind so he CAN heal. So he CAN respond to treatment. So he isn't so distressed, and the power of his own mind can aid him, rather than hurt him in his healing process.<br />This is a vital book for anyone, but especially parents, because kids tend to live such rough-and-tumble lives. (At least my boys do!)	2003-10-15

Not quite as intense, but still far different from the typical historical romance light reading.<br />The heroine finds herself suddenly needing to deal with the ton, after basically being raised in the jungles by her father. She's afraid she won't fit in, and she's struggling to make her way in society alone.<br />The hero is an outcast, too, and very quickly we see that these two people are going to need to find each other while trying to navigate their way through high society of Regency England.<br />There is more action in this book than other stories Kinsale has written, and the hero is somewhat less the tortured hero needing saving from himself. His problems are very real, but they are more external than internal. The hero himself is pretty well-adjusted. Which works, since the world around him seems to really be trying to do him in, and he's got enough troubles as it is.<br />I found the heroine to be very sweet, and I really enjoyed reading about the troubles she had dealing with high society in Regency England. As an American, I am sure I would have the same problems, thrown into a similar situation. It was interesting to see that period described from this viewpoint. <br />This is a phenomenal book for a first novel!<br />If you haven't read &quot;The Shadow and the Star&quot;, I would recommend reading this one first, then following up with &quot;The Shadow and the Star&quot;, since it's sort of a sequel (although I think &quot;The Shadow and the Star&quot; is my very favorite historical romance.)	2003-10-15

I found it actually helped me deal with my own grief - not something I expected when I started to read it.<br />As a child, I adored this book. As an adult, I have an even greater respect for the philosophies in it.<br />I can see now, from the perspective of a few years, that this book really did help me develop my own spiritual beliefs and understandings.

I ended up with questions I'd never had before, which made this book really valuable to me.<br />The death penalty, racism, hate crimes, family struggles, forgiveness, taking responsibility for one's actions are all covered in this one book - it was truly an intense read. <br />I cried through a lot of it. This is definitely not escapism, light reading! It's not terribly action-filled - very unlike other Grisham books I've read.

Johnny Goodboy Tyler is a true hero -- we don't find him weakened by internal struggles or suffering much. He knows exactly what the right thing to do is, and he just does it. <br />The villains are really horrible - no bones about it. You just want to watch the hero wipe 'em all out, with no second thoughts. <br />These elements are really pretty fairy-tale-ish. Most modern-day books don't have such black-and-white heroes and villains, and I found it a refreshing change. <br />Our hero is larger than life - the story is larger than life. It's really HUGE! It's a fast, action-packed story, highly entertaining. Once I picked it up, I truly could not put it down. This was actually a bit of a struggle for me, since the book is over 1,000 pages and can't be read in a day. <br />I found the story slowed down towards the end, as the fast paced action gave way to the subtleties of diplomacy. I've read this book a couple of times (I always re-read my favorite stories), and the first time I really didn't enjoy this part of the reading at all. The second time through I found myself enjoying it much more. Perhaps with age I've learned the importance of diplomacy, so it just made more sense to me. When Johnny Goodboy Tyler perfects his diplomacy, I find he's even more larger-than-life than before.<br />This is a great story if you're looking for a book with big, heroic heroes, and villians you can really hate, and a great, big, huge action tale!	2003-10-08

Every child can relate to the topic of being afraid of a new food that looks weird. <br />It's so imaginative... really, a wild enough story to satisfy any child.	2003-10-06

I wish I had been given this book before I started college - it would have made my studies much easier. <br />This book covers the basic technology of successful study. <br />Did you ever get to the bottom of a page and realize you don't know what you just read? <br />Have you ever gotten headaches or stomaches while studying?<br />Have you ever felt frustrated by study materials? <br />Did you ever just want to throw a textbook away and quit the class?<br />I, like probably most everybody, have experienced all these things. This little book explains what EXACTLY happens to cause these different phenomenon. Not only does it explain the cause, but it gives very simple - VERY simple - ways to handle them! <br />I use these study techniques with my children. My 12-year-old just read the whole set of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and is now reading &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; - not something most 12-year-old kids can do. He's been reading high school science books for a few years now, and he uses these techniques himself in his study.<br />This study technology makes it possible for anyone able to read to be able to read anything. Legal documents, scientific texts, whatever -- if you use the techniques as laid out in this book, you can learn anything.	2003-10-05

This is one of the best books on education that I've read.<br />Holt really just advocates that we treat children with respect, and allow them some self determinism in their own education.<br />It is a radical viewpoint, unfortunately - he really strips away many of the false notions regarding education that the teacher's colleges seem to promote - but I think it's a sane viewpoint, all the same. Children raised and educated this way are surely more whole, stable, self-confident and able.<br />The book is a series of essays, which is a great format for this kind of material. I found it really compelling reading.<br />While I don't agree with absolutely everything in this book (he recommends that we have children guess at word meanings, rather than having them use a dictionary, which I strongly disagree with), almost everything else he says rings true for me.<br />Highly recommmended!	2003-10-05

But if they really want dessert, they are going to have to learn to follow the rules.<br />It's a really sweet story - little kids can relate to the temptation to break the rules, and the joy of feeling the freedom the puppies experience on the hillside as they're exploring the brand new world. <br />We love this story!	2003-10-05

How horrifying -- the heroine of this story does not get to choose her own husband. And unhappily, her father does not seem to care whether her future husband belches at the dinner table, has children older than she is, or doesn't seem to notice that she is a real person with thoughts of her own.<br />Catherine is a young girl, but faced with real grown-up problems. She is child enough to have little control over her own destiny, yet considered old enough to be married to the richest suitor.<br />The story begins with Catherine as a self-absorbed, rebellious child. It is her diary - and we follow her throughout a year, as she grows into a mature young woman. <br />In the end, she accepts her destiny with wonderful grace. I felt very proud of her, and also very glad that times have changed since the Middle Ages!<br />Very appropriate for young girls - very thought-provoking and challenging, but not in any way controversial reading.	2003-10-03

This is a very intense tale of a man who is plunged into madness, only to find himself in an institution for the insane (the last place anyone would want to be!) and the spiritual woman who tries to save him.<br />The hero - a once able, vibrant, brilliant man, has been laid low by a stroke - not understood at the time. It was actually horrifying to read his struggles - tied to his bed, tossed into icy water by vindictive &quot;caretakers&quot;, treated like an imbecile.<br />His journey to health is complicated by the desire of his &quot;doctor&quot; to keep him powerless and under his command at all costs. <br />Not just any woman could have seen the beauty in this man - it took a very strong woman with a vast reserve of spiritual strength and great integrity to even see him inside the damaged frame, let alone help him. <br />The heroine fights her family, her friends, and society to save the hero - a wonderful change from &quot;hero-saves-heroine&quot; type of love story.<br />This is definitely not light reading, but it is really a brilliant work, and one of my all-time favorites!	2003-10-03

Yes, it was intense -- the purification process laid out in this book took me 9 days, 5 hours a day. But it changed my life.<br />I spent my childhood swimming on a beach that boasted a view of a nuclear power plant - it sat on the same lake, just down the beach a bit. Living in big cities, I absorbed plenty of toxins from the air and the water. These reasons alone would have justified the time and energy it took me to handle the toxins - but I really needed to handle the effects of medical drugs I'd taken over the years, not to mention the street drugs I had &quot;experimented&quot; with when I was in college.<br />Before I did the purification process, I felt very foggy - I couldn't think as clearly as I wanted to. I was critical of everyone and everything. I had trouble reading -- I was just too foggy!<br />By the time I completed the program, I was a different person. It's like I had been viewing the world through the wrong end of a pair of binoculars - everything seemed so distant, and I was disconnected from it all.<br />Now I know that was the effects of the drugs - not only did they create this distance between myself and the world, but they also created the negativity and critical attitude I had. The strange thing is, I didn't even realize I was critical until I was on the program, and it alleviated!<br />I found myself feeling young again - bright, joyous, able to really take pleasure in life. I like people again!<br />This was an amazing process for me. It gave me back my life. <br />I can't recommend it highly enough for anyone who has had any medical treatments or drugs.	2003-10-03

I felt I was living the aftermath of Ground Zero with him - the present-time living intermingled with the backflashes of horror and grief that must be either be drowned out or dealt with eventually. (And in my own faint mirror of his story, I can relate. Although I am a stay-at-home mom living thousands of miles away, I know the experience of having the horror of September 11th creep back into my consciousness, bringing with it moments of grief and loss. I can only imagine how much more intense this must be for a man like McCole, who grew up with firefighters in New York and, as a Lieutenant who was not assigned to a particular firehouse, worked with many of those firefighters who were lost at the World Trade Center.)<br />Lt. McCole, consistent with the courage that firefighters display when challenged by physical threats on a daily basis, chose to confront both the mental and emotional pain of September 11th, and the physical trauma that affected him as it has so many of the firefighters who worked at Ground Zero. Likewise, in this same tradition of heroism, he shares his tale of how he worked to bring the same solace and help to his fellow firefighters. And so the story becomes not just a maudlin tale of the aftermath of terrorism, but a tale of one man's spiritual journey and his determination to bring help of a more lasting kind, to his fellow heroes.<br />This book sat on my shelf for two months, unread. I feared that reading it would feel like slowing down on a freeway in order to gawk at the scene of a terrible accident, or like watching some grisly murder story that the news tends to sensationalize it a macabre circus these days. Instead, I found myself challenged spiritually and deeply grateful for the glimpse into the heart and mind of a truly courageous hero. Thank you, Lt. McCole, for your contributions above and beyond the call of duty.	2003-02-19

Each monster has its own set of pages - one with a big, bright picture of the monster, and a poem on the facing page. <br />The pages are very big, the illustrations are really fun and bright, and the monsters are not very scary at all - quite loveable, actually. <br />This book is appropriate for very young children.

Then a range of choices are given... advice on actual steps one can take to restore or improve communication, and why that is important, pitfalls to avoid in these situations (like deprogrammers), how to communicate your concerns to your loved one without alienating him or trampling on his rights, etc.<br />Surprisingly enough, the book gives good advice for parents about how to prepare one's child for the myriad of religious choices out there! Very useful for just about any parent, I think.<br />Many varied real-life examples are given, along with their successful resolution.<br />No one religion holds the focus of this book, and it is not an overview of the religions of the world, but rather a basic guide anyone can use in restoring communication with a loved one who has joined a new or little-known religion. Advice on researching the religion is very clearly written and easy to understand and follow. Reading this book should be a first step towards resolving this sort of conflict.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is concerned about a loved one's religious choices. Also, I would recommend this book to anyone who has changed religions and may have relatives or friends who are concerned about this change - this book is sure to assist in fostering understanding and preventing a host of upsets in the future.<br />Every library should have a copy of this book, and I recommend it to mediators, religious leaders, family counselors, etc.	2002-04-03

I am so glad I found this book!<br />My oldest daughter is approaching the pre-teen years, and I knew I'd have to get her a book that explains all the stuff I learned in 'sex ed', but I didn't want to give her all the psycho-babble that came with my class. <br />I like this book because it is simply a how-to of body care. The approach is, \\"you've got a body, and you're growing up, and you're going to have to take more responsibility for taking care of your body. Now, since you're growing up, there are some things that will change about caring for your body...\\"<br />The book covers such innocuous topics as brushing your teeth and taking care of your hair. But it explains also about braces, and how to prevent head lice, and how often to shower. How to handle body odor and what to do when hair starts growing in new and unusual places. Nutrition, exercise and athletes feet are addressed. <br />Of course, there is plenty of data on how to find a bra that fits. What happens when a girl menstruates, and how to practice good hygiene. There is a brief discussion about body image, and it's all very positively handled in the book.<br />The only part that I thought wasn't totally correct was the bit on nutrition. It assumes that the \\"food pyramid\\" is a correct diet for everyone and it says that a person should eat all these grains every day. (When in reality, a huge number of people are allergic to grains, and most people can survive better on just vegetables, fruit and protein. Of course, the cereal companies gave the government educational system lots of money to promote the massive grain consumption, so there you go. It's now part of our \\"education\\". I do feel this was a little slip in this book. They bought into the government-pushed propaganda, and I didn't like that. Other than this, though, the book is just excellent.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone with a pre-teen daughter. Very useful, and positive.	2002-02-25

This book has a lot going for it, but I wouldn't recommend it for every child.<br />A very positive point for this book, is that it's written at about a second-grade level. Equivalent to the \\"Step 2\\" or \\"Level 2\\" books. It's actually got quite a story, but it's written easily enough for beginning readers to enjoy, which is really great and sometimes hard to find.<br />I thought the illustrations were wonderful and whimsical. <br />The story itself might be a little tough for an already extremely empathetic child to read. Since it depicts the feelings of ducks who are being hunted, this might be a sensitive issue for some. Introduce this book to the child of a hunting family, or even just a family of typical meat-eaters and you might find yourself with an angry little vegetarian on your hands! (Especially interesting, when contrasted against Dahl's \\"Danny, The Champion of the World\\" - a hunter's hero!)<br />My children enjoyed this story (and still eat their burgers), but I think for some children, it might raise some ethical problems. Which isn't always a bad thing, of course! But parents beware! This story might lead to a domestic revolt.<br />Of course, any family of vegetarians won't have a problem with this story at all. And, as another reviewer mentioned, this book can certainly offer some good \\"empathy\\" discussions with children.	2002-02-15

Put the sticky puzzle aside, and perhaps the next day a new line of attack may suddenly strike you. Or you can try to solve an easier puzzle similar to the sticky one.

This book is a Dr. Seuss \\"Bright And Early for Beginning Beginners\\" book. However, I have found the phonics method to be too tough for any beginning reader.<br />It seems to be written for the parent to read to the child; after all, a book introducing the letter \\"A\\" is not for a child already reading. So, we're looking at a child between the ages of 3 and 7. And this book as one of the first looks at the letter \\"A\\". <br />But the letter sounds used are \\"a\\" as in \\"ant\\", \\"angry\\", \\"across\\" and \\"aaaarrrgh\\". <br />The problem with this, is that most phonics methods introduce only one \\"A\\" sound at a time (usually the short a sound, as in \\"ant\\".) To introduce all these sounds at once for just one letter can be confusing to a child.<br />Also, there are only 28 words in this book, but several of them will be unfamiliar to the average 3, 4 or 5 year old. Such as \\"advance\\" (as in what an army does), apricot, angleworm, acorn and Arizona.<br />I think this book could be confusing to some children, and isn't worth much in terms of teaching a child beginning phonics. This is definitely not my favorite Berenstains' book.	2002-02-15

This marvelous story about a boy and his admiration and love for his father is a true masterpiece!<br />I fell in love with both Danny and his father, and both characters were so compelling I could almost overlook his father's deep, dark secret. (I won't ruin the surprise for you.)<br />Danny has a rather unconventional upbringing. His father, a mechanic, keeps him out of school until he is seven, because he feels it's important that the boy be able to completely take apart & put back together an automobile motor by the time he enters school. Danny's home education is by no means limited to automobiles; his father is a true naturalist, and shares his knowledge of birds, plants and animals with Danny.<br />Not only does Danny adore his father, but it is clear that Danny is his father's best friend.<br />The story really gets going after Danny is in school -- and discovers his father's secret. That's where the fun begins!<br />This tale was alternately heart-rending and hilarious. I absolutely love this one and expect that our copy will become very tattered in a few years' time.	2002-02-15

Because it is broken up into 1,000 + lessons, one can study as much or as little as one wants per day.<br />Other Esperanto language books that I've seen (including Esperanto) introduce a number of grammar rules (or exceptions), vocabulary, and exercises. This is way too much for a young child! But this book breaks every new concept into it's own section. For instance, in one section you'll learn that there is no translation of the articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; in Esperanto.<br />Now, that's obviously too small a section to take up at one time... but you might want to only cover 2 sections, or maybe you'll want to take on 8 sections at a time. It's up to you - how much time you've got on your hands, the age of the student, etc.<br />One section, which introduced the first sentence and a number of nouns, I spent a week on with my children. But it was just one simple grammar rule, so it wasn't overwhelming at all. We all had fun.<br />The biggest drawback to this book is that not all the words are defined - the author assumes you will understand that &quot;monto&quot; means &quot;mountain&quot; and &quot;dromedaro&quot; is &quot;dromedary&quot;. You'll need access to a good Esperanto/English dictionary in order to really succeed with this book. <br />At the end of 2 weeks study with this book, my kids knew well over 200 words (and we skipped the ones that would be more difficult for the younger ones, like the translation for &quot;ideal&quot; and the cities and rivers). We were on page 6... and already knew hundreds of words.<br />There are some really entertaining poems and quaint little words of wisdom. The author is quite a character, and the book is very lively.<br />This is an excellent resource, and I highly recommend it. Please email me if you would like some suggestions about using this book with children - we've been having a lot of success and a lot of fun.	2002-02-15

I think the main message to this story is that children are absolutely wonderful.<br />In this story, Thomas starts the day sad... he wants to play with the children, but he has to work instead. The happy ending is when he helps his friend (the bus which breaks down) by taking the children home. <br />Thomas is obviously thrilled to be able to help the children. What a warm, sweet message to give to the young readers!<br />This is an \\"I can read it all by myself Dr. Seuss Beginner Book\\", and it's written as though a young reader should read it, in very short, choppy sentences (\\"My name is Thomas. Watch me push! Watch me pull!... Stop or go. Help or hurry.\\" <br />But the actual words used are not those that the true beginning reader will be able to read on his or her own. (station, somebody, coaches, Clarabel, bridge, should, friend, passengers, etc.) It's fine to have very simple sentences for the beginning reader; or to address the book to the not-such-a-beginner-reader. But this book seems to take the worst combination; dumbed down story with too-hard words.<br />That said, my children really enjoy this book; the annoying aspects only seem to annoy me. And, of course, their opinion is what really counts. The older kids love to read it to the younger ones, and they think it's great that Thomas gets to have his trip with the children.<br />4 stars because the kids like it so much, and because it really does have a worthwhile message for children.	2002-02-15

And boy, was it was fun!<br />Although the title gives the impression that this is the kind of book a parent ought to pass up, it is really very well done. <br />Of course, it includes the list of 101 ways to bug your parents - which was the theme of Sneeze's own story in the book. But can you blame him? After all, his summer vacation WAS ruined!<br />But while Sneeze misses out on his summer plans, he gains a great deal in wisdom. A lot of important things are touched on in this book - what it might feel like to lose one's parent, a growing awareness of financial problems that adults often face, what's truly important in a friend, and even a hint of budding romance.<br />It's all in there! And it puts everything into perspective for Sneeze. I think most kids could learn something from this story.<br />I am impressed by this book and will look for other titles by thia author for my kids to read.<br />Well done!	2002-02-15

This story (about a boy who brings a puppy home) is told from the boy's point-of-view, but the illustrations are another matter!<br />The boy says, \\"I am teaching my puppy how to heel\\" and we see the boy wrapped in the leash... the puppy straining to break free and play. The boy says, \\"...he already knows how to fetch\\" and we see him throwing a stick. On the following page, an angry lady is chasing the puppy... who is running away from her with a lady's hat in his mouth!<br />The story ends on a sweet note.<br />I really love how the Little Critter books focus on events that are real to children, and focus so much on the family in such a positive, light way.<br />And my children love this book.	2002-02-08

I have found that I can't trust the data in this reference book at all.<br />For instance, under guaifenesin (an expectorant) it lists 22 over-the-counter liquids/tablets/capsules that contain guaifenesin, but it doesn't say which is in what form! So, if you are looking for guaifenesin in capsules (without the sugars and dyes found in the liquid), good luck! You'll have to contact 22 companies to find out which ones make it in capsule.<br />Then it mentions when to stop giving your child the medication - for instance, ifyour child becomes drowsy or develops nausea. Now, everything I've ever seen about guaifenesin indicates that rare nausea is the only known side effect, so this other warning about drowsiness doesn't make much sense to me. Why would a child become nauseated? No more info is given on it, so I'm left with a mystery...<br />Then, onto Ritalin, which I checked, just to see what it had to say. First of all, Ritalin doesn't have a listing by that name - but in the index it directs the reader to \\"Methylphenidate Hydrochloride\\", it's scientific, but little-known name. It mentions that Ritalin is a \\"mild central-nervous-system stimulant\\", but fails to mention that it is a Schedule II CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE, in the same category as cocaine and methamphetamine!!! <br />It does list the serious potential side effects, such as Tourette's syndrome, seizures, hallucinations, convulsions, delirium, etc., as well as the importance of not keeping a child on Ritalin for long periods of time. But it does not mention the possibility of suicide in children when they are taken off the drug, nor the very high percentages of children who use other drugs once Ritalin is taken away from them! The entire addiction factor of Ritalin is ignored by this reference book.<br />Another example is the Talcom Powder listing. It doesn't mention that talcum powder sometimes contains asbestos, and that a relationship between talcum powder use and ovarian cancer has been established.<br />Allin all, this is a very poor reference book, and I feel it's a potential liability to anyone who trusts the data within.	2002-02-07

This review is on the \\"Autobiography\\" as I have not read this particular edition, so I don't know what the \\"other writings\\" are.<br />This story is brilliantly written. So powerful, I had a hard time believing that Miss Jane Pittman is a fictional character; she was very real in my mind.<br />As a look at life for African Americans during the Civil War, the post-Civil War years, through the first half of last century, and the civil rights protests of the 60's, this story made these times for this particular population more real to me than any other essays, letters, stories or histories ever had before.<br />This book is not the easiest to confront - nothing is glossed over, yet it is not depressing to read, oddly enough. The writer masterfully uses the sad, cruel events of those times to demonstrate the strength and beauty of his heroine. <br />I would not recommend this book for young children, but I think this would be a wonderful addition to any high school education.	2002-02-07

It is best when used with the other books in the series, as certain portions of it - especially history - are intended to follow the earlier books in the series, and be followed by the 6th grade book.<br />Language arts include stories and speeches (including exceprts from &quot;The Iliad&quot; and &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Lincoln's Gettysburg Acddress and &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;), poetry (including &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, &quot;Ballad of John Henry&quot;), some basic grammar, discussion of literature (such as alliteration, use of imagery and symbols) and the meanings of various common sayings.<br />Geography and World Civilization cover latitude and longitude, and the formation of lakes, with emphasis on the Great Lakes. World Civilization covers the Incas, Aztecs and Mayas, the European exploration of the Americas, the colonies, the Renaissance in Europe, Feudal Japan, Russia from Ivan the Great through Catherine the Great, The Enlightenment and the French Revolution. There is a good look at the philosophical influence of Descartes and other Enlightenment thinkers on the founding of the United States. <br />American Civilization covers the period of time from the Missouri Compromise through the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Impeachment of President Johnson (with a discussion of the government's form that permits this sort of thing), the &quot;Wild West&quot; and Transcontinental Railroad, Treatment of Native Americans, the Cuban War and Yellow Journalism, culminating in how the U.S. became a world power.<br />This section is full of pictures, and I really like the scope of topics discussed here.<br />Fine arts mostly discusses art of the Renaissance, including paintings, sculpture and music. <br />Math is comprehensive, from reviewing such basics as simple addition to decimals, division, fractions, measurement, ratios and graphs, finding volume, rates and speed, and functions and equations. The math is definitely not intended to be a student's only textbook, but rather an overview and explanation of what should be covered by the end of 5th grade.<br />Life sciences covers classification, cells, the &quot;other three kingdoms&quot; (fungi, protists and monerans), reproduction in plants and animals, and the human growth cycle. Reproduction in humans is briefly explained, in a very matter-of-fact manner without a bunch of &quot;psychology&quot; added in.<br />Physical sciences covers mechanical concepts, electricity, transferring heat energy, and engines, as well as some little biographies of scientists.<br />Although all these subjects are crammed into this one little book, it seems that no space is really wasted. There is a lot of info in here, and it is broad enough that a child can find something that interests him, for further research.<br />Highly recommended!	2002-02-07

I like this book, because it's written for a young child to read herself . My kids are able to read this one by the time they are 7, which is nice. It has a lot of pages, lots of story to it - which is hard to find in books that are written at the young reader's level.<br />What really surprised me about this book is that it addresses what happens when one has a friend that isn't very nice, and it really went into the situation in detail. The heroine of the story didn't become a martyr, and neither did she just turn her back on her friend altogether.<br />When my daughter first read this book, she'd had some bad experiences with a friend - who is remarkably like Thelma, Frances's friend. I thought it was a nice tool for us - we discussed how sometimes a friend might not be very nice, and what the options are in dealing with this type of situation.<br />This is a very good early reader for girls and a nice story for any girl who has a friend they really can't trust.

I like this one, because, unlike most children's dictionaries, most words a child will need to look up will be in there, and because most of the definitions are adequate. (Children's dictionaries are usually  notoriously incomplete!)<br />My kids have a couple of dictionaries available when they study - if the word they need to get defined is not in this one (or if the needed definition is not included), they'll look it up in a high school or college dictionary. Fortunately, this doesn't happen very often!<br />I do recommend that every child have a copy of THIS particular dictionary, as it's the best one I've come across for younger kids. Also, I recommend Hubbard's \\"How to Use a Dictionary\\" book/course, so every student can really use dictionaries with success.<br />Happy studying!	2002-01-26

One thing that was missing in my own education was instruction on how to properly use a dictionary. Usually, when I tried to look up a word, I went away more confused than before!<br />This book explains the proper method of using a dictionary so more confusion does not result! Which may not seem, at the outset, to be very important, but I believe it is the single most important aspect of education.<br />In modern education, children are usually taught to \\"guess\\" at the meanings of words. Which might sound fine, unless your mother is about to undergo surgery, and you consider the strong possibility the surgeon about to put her under the knife came across plenty of words in his study that he was told to \\"guess the meaning\\" of. Or how about the next time you board a plane? Do you really want a pilot who was taught to just \\"guess\\" at those definitions? I sure wouldn't want a lawyer to draft a contract on my behalf, unless I knew for certain that HE knew the definition of every \\"heretofore\\" and \\"forthwith\\"! (\\"heretofore\\" means \\"up to this time\\" and \\"forthwith\\" means \\"immediately\\".)<br />To be truly successful, one must fully understand the meanings of the words one comes across in life, and especially in one's profession. <br />This book will give your child that advantage. His SAT scores will be better. His ability to fully understand what he is studying depends upon his ability to discover the exact meaning of the words he comes across. His LOVE of study depends on this as well!<br />My children studied this book, and continue to apply the principles. When they come across words they don't understand, they get them defined! As a result, they are bright and interested in learning.<br />With this book, you will not only learn HOW to use a dictionary, but WHAT dictionaries to use. <br />I recommend this book to every parent I know...	2002-01-22

It is not intended to be a child's only source of materials, but rather a guideline for what should be covered each year.<br />I would not imagine that a child would sit down with the book and read through it; that is not actually the intention of the editor. Rather, it covers the basic subjects and give further resources where the parent or teacher can find more information on the subjects. <br />As any reviewer of this book should have read, in the Introduction, the editor writes, \\"The books in this series are designed to be useful tools for parents and teachers, both at home and in school. They are called 'resources' to signal that they do not replace the regular local school curriculum, but rather serve as aids to help children gain some of the important knowledge they will need to make progress in school and be effective in society.\\"<br />For my children, we use checksheets that cover the material in the books, but use corresponding reference matter that we already have. For the younger kids (grades K - 2), I would not recommend sitting them down with the book at all... but rather, sitting down with them - reading it with the child - making it interesting. Looking for more data via the internet, or World Book, or atlases. <br />The idea behind the series is that if each school district, private school and homeschool uses a different format each year, children who move around will be at a severe disadvantage. A child going from a homeschool environment to a public school, for instance, may spend two years studying the same material, and may miss some other vital component to his education completely. The Core Knowledge series, used as it is in private and public schools alike, eliminates this problem.<br />Someone with a 3rd grader in a private school that uses the Core Knowledge guidelines will know their child is \\"on track\\" with the public school's 3rd graders, if they use the same system. Then, if that privately educated 3rd grader transfers to the public school in 4th grade, he is not at a great disadvantage.<br />Since we create our own curriculum, this is a very nice reference to have. I make sure everything in these books are covered in my children's homeschooling. That doesn't mean it's all we do! But we do cover this material.<br />The 3rd grade book covers extensively the Roman Empire, including Roman mythology, the Roman invasions of North Africa, and the rise of Islam. American history stretches from the first Americans through European settlements in America and culminates in the signing of the Declaration of Independence. <br />The math section is strictly to be used as a guideline for what the typical 3rd grader should be learning in math. Explanations for various math concepts are given, but exercises must come from another source.<br />Science briefly covers the food chain, environmental pollution, animals that live in colonies, the human nervous system, electricity, chemistry, astronomy and famous scientists. Again, this information is not intended to be the sole source of educational materials for your child, but rather an overview of the subjects that should be covered in 3rd grade.<br />Language Arts contains excerpts from a few classics \\"Arabian Nights\\" and \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\", among others, some poetry, grammar, sayings and phrases and Norse mythology.<br />I highly recommend these books to homeschoolers, teachers and all parents who want to ensure their child is receiving a comprehensive education... I have been using them for years now, and my children are doing very well...	2002-01-06

This and the other books in this series, are such a great idea. <br />They give a basic structure to what your child should be learning about each year, which is particularly important if your child is likely to change school districts, or go from private to public school, or from homeschooling into a school setting. Because so many schools use the Core Knowledge guidelines, your child won't have big gaps in her education, if she has been taught a curriculum based on these guidelines.<br />Each book in the series cover all the basic subjects: math, science, history, geography, language arts, art and music. The sections are broken down into small pieces, and one part can be taken up each day pretty easily.<br />Additional references are included for every subject, so your child can more fully explore the areas that interest him.<br />The language arts section includees excerpts from some great adventure classics, like \\"Treasure Island\\" and \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" It also covers poetry, grammar, and common sayings and phrases. The grammar is not in itself adequate, and I would recommend that homeschoolers use additional materials for grammar.<br />World Civilization covers the Middle Ages. European history is extensive, but this also includes a very nice look at Asia during this period of time. This is much more extensive than what I was taught of the Middle Ages during my entire elementary education. The geography section corresponds with this study, but also looks at all parts of the world.<br />American Civilization pretty much covers the period from the signing of the Constitution through the 1840's (Manifest Destiny and the Mexican War). Again, if your child has studied the previous books in the series, this will fit in nicely - the 3rd grade book covers the colonies through the signing of the Declaration of Independence. There are lots of pictures and other resources you can use to augment this study.<br />The fine arts section covers music (hard to do with a book, but notes & reading sheet music is in there) and visual art, which largely discusses architecture during the Middle Ages.<br />A very comprehensive overview of math is given. This is not to be used as the sole source of math work, but a basic overview of what your child should be learning during 4th grade.<br />The science section covers paleontology, the cardiovascular system, rocks & the composition of the earth, weather and electricity. The best part about the science section, is that you can find out what really interests your child, and there are additional resources recommended for the various studies... ...	2002-01-06

Anyone who feels a bit &quot;run down&quot; by life, or who has suffered losses, can be assisted by this method.<br />I wish I had known this technique when I was a rape crisis counselor - it would have helped many women I knew enormously!<br />The purpose of these processes are to pull a person back into the here and now. After the death of a loved one, failed relationships, serious injuries, etc., one can become &quot;stuck in the incident&quot; - and have a gloomy outlook thereafter. These processes gently bring a person's attention back under their own control - and out of the past incidents that have been haunting them.<br />One can use these processes on himself, or on another. They are even good to use on children, and not necessarily just for people who have experienced trauma. They can improve a person's memory, and just brighten one's outlook in general.<br />Even my 9 year old daughter is able to use these processes on her younger siblings and her friends. My kids consider Self Analysis to be &quot;fun&quot; and it is!<br />You can just try it out and see how you like it. I think it's great!	2001-11-09

It is useful as a history of Esperanto, because it was first written in the '40's. There is a great deal of information about the then-current groups of that era, as well as discussion about government and other organizations using Esperanto, and the growth of the language at that time.<br />This book seems to have been written for the Esperanto &quot;traveler&quot; - the excercises revolve around conversations involving restaurants, hotels, and train stations. Not very useful, I think, in this day and age when the average hotel clerk has almost no chance of knowing the language. But the excercises are well laid out - not too much vocabulary all at once, and good dialogue in each chapter.<br />What I most appreciate about this textbook are the notes on grammar. I have found these to be just wonderful help, very needed!  <br />I have really enjoyed this book and would recommend any Esperantist to get it if he or she can find it!	2001-11-03

The vocabulary choices are good, with more difficult words being introduced in a logical manner (not all at once!) The excercises are at a good gradient - not too hard -- and the words a new Esperantist would need are introduced early on.<br />Within just a few days I was able to correspond with Esperanto speakers from all over the world.<br />I highly recommend the language and this book!	2001-11-03

I first read this book years ago when expecting my first child, and I continue to re-read parts of it whenever I feel I need some more support.<br />The beginning essay, &quot;How to Live With Children&quot; is truly wonderful. My viewpoint on children didn't necessarily change from reading this book, but was certainly strengthened. Children aren't animals to be trained, they don't &quot;belong&quot; to their parents (they are individuals with rights of their own) and they deserve to be treated with respect.<br />It is true that children can try a parent's patience, though, and the author, a father himself, was well aware of that. He provides some very simple, wonderful methods for handling common problems that children and their parents can have.<br />For instance:<br />What do you do when you give your child a new toy and he immediately breaks it?<br />What do you do when your child gets hurt and doesn't cheer up for too long afterwards?<br />What do you do when your child acts up in order to get attention?<br />What do you do with a child who is angry and rebellious, or who has suffered losses and is stuck in grief?<br />With 6 young children, these things are important for me to be able to handle successfully. My kids are very able, happy, well adjusted children, and this book has a great deal to do with my overall success as a parent.<br />I recommend this to anyone who deals with children in any measure!	2001-11-03

Some answers, real explanations, and a cure!	As a fibromyalgia sufferer for many years, I was first unaware of what was wrong with me - then, upon proper diagnosis, I was disheartened. No one seemed to understand the causes or cure for this illness, and from everything I read, it was clear to me that I was only going to get worse.<br />This book explains how fibromyalgia occurs - what the cells are actually doing, and why it results in such a myriad of symptoms and so much pain. Why one month I would feel fine, and then suddenly WHAM! I was unable to so much as walk to the park with my kids.<br />The treatment is simple, although it's not a quick-fix. It IS a fix, however, and that gives me a great amount of hope. There are many people who have been on this treatment for years, who have had marvelous results and who say they finally have their lives back. <br />I have just begun the treatment, and I am noticing a difference. This book is a must-read for anyone with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, myofascial pain syndrome, irritable bowel or bladder suyndrome, chronic candidiasis, insomnia, hypoglycemia, muscular pain. These may all be related to fibromyalgia, whether you feel muscular pain or not. (A doctor can properly diagnose you.)<br />The book is easy to read, with great diagrams to assist in one's understanding of the technical concepts. It is written with compassion and humor. <br />My understanding of my illness has increased enormously as a result of this book.	2001-11-03

What a cute idea! <br />A medieval mouse couple find an adventure, and your child gets to imagine the dialogue and create the narration as she goes along.<br />The story is told without words, using half-pages that show action (each page has a little page you turn to see what is happening - for instance, the mice approach a drawbridge... flip the tiny page, and you see them crossing the drawbridge.)<br />It's a small book, but nicely illustrated. We like it!	2001-11-03

This is a very concise, yet thorough look at our language. It starts with the history of languages, the percentage of the world population that speak the most common languages, a diagram of Indo-European languages and which one evolved from what. It defines terms like &quot;semantics&quot;, &quot;phonetics&quot;, &quot;phonemics&quot;, &quot;phonics&quot;, &quot;morphemics&quot;, etc. It gives nine different alphabets, including sign language, smoke signals and morse code. It gives examples of Hebrew and Japanese. There are some very informative drawings of the mouth, and how sounds are made.<br />And that's just the first 15 pages.<br />If you want to know what the &quot;CAT&quot; in CAT scan stands for, or why we write &quot;please R.S.V.P.&quot; on party invitations, you can find the answers here.<br />This book is very nicely laid out, easy to read and aesthetic, with nice pictures and lots of color. There is just tons of information in this book, but it's not weighty or difficult to understand. Unlike a typical textbook, one piece can be understood at a time - one doesn't need to start from the beginning and read all the way through it.<br />I knew this book would be useful for my kids, but when I read the page that completely - and simply - defined &quot;past perfect tense&quot;, &quot;present perfect tense&quot; and &quot;future perfect tense&quot;, I was sold. I immediately called my friend who is the head teacher at a K-12 school, and told her she needed to get this book! (Turns out she already has it, and uses it all the time with her students.)<br />I can't say enough good things about this book!	2001-10-25

The author explores a deeper sort of love - not based on mere physical attraction or infatuation, but based on deep, abiding friendship and respect. This story, too, has its lessons.<br />The character development in \\"Villette\\" was more complete than in any other novel I've ever read. I became fascinated by the unattractive little professor, and by other characters as well.<br />Unfortunately, there is a lot of French in this story, and what appeared to be the most pivotal moments were written in French... dialogue that I really wanted to understand was just lost on me. That was truly unfortunate. I'll have to find someone to translate for me sometime.<br />\\"Shirley\\" is the best of all. The beginning is arduous. I had to use my dictionary throughout, but the beginning is particular difficult. Shall I say.. boring, even. I found that, once I forced myself through the beginning, I was very much rewarded.<br />This story is a gem. The female heroines - Shirley and Caroline - were wonderful to get to know. Shirley is not the sort of female I would have thought Bronte had had occasion to know, so this was enlightening for me.<br />Truly an eye-opening look at 19th century feminism! And incorporated into these wonderful romance stories.<br />\\"The Professor\\" was a bit more dry than the others, although it was fun to read a romance story strictly from the male viewpoint. For a first novel, this was really incredibly well written.<br />As for \\"Wuthering Heights\\", it's beena number of years since I've read the story, so I won't attempt a review here.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes \\"Wuthering Heights\\" or \\"Jane Eyre\\". All these stories are wonderfully written, with complex characters and interesting plots. The work of true genius.	2001-10-25

This book was designed to bring out the cutest in your baby!<br />My little ones have had so much fun filling up the little holes with cheerios. It's a &quot;find the missing part of the picture&quot; game, and encourages their coordination, as they put the cheerios in the empty spaces. It's really a very fun book, part game and part learning, and then there's the eating involved...<br />We have had lots of fun with this one.

I helped my son and an adult get through the course that is included in this book. They had wonderful results!<br />The adult was a guy who went through the public school system - 20 years in the workforce - but just felt his literacy level wasn't what it should be. He had never really learned the simplest grammar rules, and was confused about a lot of what he read.<br />When my son did this course, he was 9 years old. It was great for both people. The steps are laid out clearly - without all the \\"confusion\\" usually found in grammar instruction.<br />I always did very well in English classes, and always earned an \\"A\\" in English on my report cards - I read a great deal, too. But even I learned a lot from this course!<br />It's just so simple, anyone with a 4th grade reading level can do it. But it doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the student, so it's appropriate for adults, too.<br />The pictures are fun, and the cartoonist who drew them was a Disney cartoonist! The pages are nice and big, too. The hardback version is very nicely bound and can both it and the paperback can put up with a bit of abuse. (I have six kids, this is important to me!)<br />Highly recommended for any parent, teacher or tutor. Or anyone who knows someone whose literacy level could use a gentle but effective boost!<br />(I do recommend the \\"Learning How to Learn\\" book or the \\"Study Skills for Life\\" book be studied first.)<br />You can email me for further info: (e-mail address)	2001-07-22

This book is really wonderful, in that it provides what is lacking in today's nonreligious culture. This moral code is up-to-date, and the concepts will not become outdated. &quot;Do not tell harmful lies&quot;, &quot;be faithful to your sexual partner&quot; and &quot;try to treat others as you would like to be treated&quot; are codes that we can live with, despite the culture we live in!<br />I recommend this book to anyone.	2001-07-16

Lots of brightly colored, fun pictures, and the words are very large on the page. Each page presents one simple concept, and many of them involve cutting things out and taping or gluing them. Lots of fun.<br />The phonics concepts are presented in a correct order, step-by step. The pages tear out nicely, too.<br />I can't say enough for this book. We've had at least 25 different phonics books/programs/workbooks and now our various children, and this book is my favorite.	2001-06-20

For one thing, it took me over a week to read it. I put it down, forgot about it, remembered the next day.. I NEVER do that with a good romance. <br />Devereaux's style is less melodramatic than that of most historical romance writers that I've come across, and in this particular book, the writing is very smooth. I just didn't like the hero at all. He was one of the least appealing heroes I've ever read about in a book. <br />But that wasn't really the problem for me. What it comes down to is that I felt &quot;yucky&quot; reading this book. Instead of lifting my spirits, this book depressed them. The hero was pretty degraded and he treated the heroine with such disrespect that I stopped pitying her and started hoping she'd leave him.<br />While I don't recommend this book, I can easily recommend other Jude Devereaux books, &quot;Remembrance&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot; come to mind as excellent examples of good, fun historical romance.	2001-06-09

My doctor recommended it to me, and he swears by it. <br />With this book, I've been able to identify my own metabolic type (it's not what I thought it was!) and I've realized some very important things about how my body works, and how it reacts to certain foods. <br />This is not a &quot;simple&quot; sort of fix. It takes some trial and error in the diet, to find out what is actually occuring with the body, and it's not as easy as Atkins or a low-fat diet. BUT, it's designed for each person's particular metabolism, and takes into account that some foods make some people sick, while they work well for others.<br />I recommend an interested person read through this book several times, and retake the test as you go along. I found that when I took the first test, I was not as aware of my body as I should have been. The results were different (and MUCH more effective) when I took the test again later, after working on the diet for a while.<br />I do think this is THE solution for people who have been struggling to find a diet that works.	2001-05-24

This was when fathers were relegated to the waiting room, and childbirth was treated like a disease that the good doctors &quot;cured&quot;.<br />Bradley examined the situation for himself, and realized that it was preposterous for childbirth to be handled the way it was. And a good thing for us that he did this!<br />In this book he explains his research, and his experiences as a doctor. He also gives the practical information that expectant fathers need, and he advocates such wonderful things as breastfeeding and &quot;taking your wife out once a week for a date!&quot; <br />Some women today might find him to be a bit &quot;patriarchal&quot;, but I think he's charming, and he's obviously got a lot of respect for women and the natural processes of the female body. He does tell the husbands to make sure they get their wives to do certain things, but I think it's great that he expects husbands to take so much responsibility! In those days, childbirth and pregnancy were not in the &quot;man's domain&quot; at all.<br />He also advocates drug-free childbirth as being the safest route for mother and baby. He gives a method of childbirth that helps ease the pain, and I advise pregnant women to read this section carefully, and do the exercises! It really does help! <br />I recommend this book to anyone who is expecting, or plans to be expecting, a baby. As an advocate of natural childbirth, I give this book 2 thumbs up!	2001-04-05

Questions that outsiders might have about any religion are answered here - an example is a list of Scientology holidays, and the history of the church, etc.<br />There is a colorfully illustrated biography of the founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and an illustrated history of the religious heritage of Scientology, too.<br />All the basic books, courses, and auditing processes are described here, as well a description of the different types of Scientology churches and groups, and their different purposes.<br />This reference is a must for anyone who is interested in the subject of Scientology, or who has friends or relatives who are Scientologists, or who simply would like to find out why this religion is becoming so popular.	2001-03-20

This is a cute story about a boy who has moved to a new apartment and has to make new friends. He's a bit insecure because of the recent changes in his life, but then Halloween comes and no one looks like they're supposed to.. <br />He thought he was too big to get scared on Halloween, but he finds out that's not the case!<br />This story isn't really scary to read, so it's appropriate for young children. The reading level is not for just-starting-out readers. Some of the harder words in the book are as follows: either, point, know, invited, climbed, faraway, special, though.<br />The text is big, and it's 48 pages. It's also a chapter book, so that's a nice encouragement for kids. There are only 8 chapters, and an average page has about 30 words on it. The pictures are nice, and the story is cute.<br />I recommend this one for kids at the 2nd grade reading level, as long as someone is there to help with the more difficult words.	2001-03-17

This is unlike most journals in that, instead of blank pages, it's got some idea-starters for kids. I have found it's easier for my kids to think of things to write about if they have something to start from. <br />This one has various lists of things started already for the young writer. For instance, the topic will be provided: &quot;Things to bring to Hogwart's school&quot; and then some examples will be listed: cauldron, owl, broomstick, etc. Then the writer can add more things that should be taken to Hogwart's, according to the book. Or things HE would take to Hogwarts, like a favorite baseball cap or something like that. OR he could make a separate list on the opposite (blank) page of things he would take to HIS school. There is plenty of room for creativity here!<br />I think this is a great way to encourage writing in children.

Every time I read it to my kids I get choked up.. have to stop.. try to pull myself together. It's very emotional, without being morose at all. Just a simple story, a sweet little song, and a &quot;circle of life&quot; theme that, in its simplicity, has this amazing power to bring one to tears.<br />And it's not just me; I handed this one to my friend to read in a bookstore, and she started crying, too. I joined in, and we were both very embarrassed, and laughing and crying at the same time. <br />You have to read this one for yourself, in order to understand. The story itself does not appear to be wringing out one's emotions intentionally; it's just there, a simple little song, but it just sort of pulls on one's heart and creates this wonderful effect.<br />Recommended, but don't blame me if you cry over it.	2001-03-17

This book gives the answer to why people engage in irrational, self-destructive behavior.

Even board books don't last long in my house (6 young children here), but this one has been around for well over a year, and it's well loved, too.<br />The rhymes are shortened to their most essential parts, perfect for little ones. We can go through the book several times in one sitting, and each poem fits neatly on a page.  <br />Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, Down By the Station, and several other popular nursery rhymes are in this book.

The concepts are defined, and instead of feeling guilty for one's transgressions, there is a very simple, yet incredibly effective, way to address these things. The result is a feeling of relief.<br />People are basically good. When we make mistakes and hurt ourselves or others, we feel guilty. Until now, there has been no easy resolution to these feelings of guilt. <br />I recommend it for EVERYONE, but I want to state that it is very effective with preteens and teenagers, too. I know many families with teens that are doing great in life, and this technology has been indispensible to these families.<br />Since reading this information, my 9 year old son has become very honest. If he does something he shouldn't, rather than keep a secret about it, he'll come to me, which is a MUCH better solution than hiding one's transgressions.	2001-03-14

They are written just as I would have written them! <br />I do wish the books were larger in size (not more pages, just bigger pages) and the pictures are just drawings - no color. An improvement of better, more colorful pictures and larger pages would get a 5-star vote from me.<br />These are great tools, and I recommend them for every beginning reader.	2001-03-13
US	50384836	R1UHYQTBRS3NSC	0884048993	286596821	The Scientology Handbook	Books	5	30	62	N	N	Lots of valuable information for parents	This book has several sections which I have found invaluable in terms of handling my children. The chapter called &quot;Children&quot; has a ton of data on how exactly to handle children and what kinds of things to avoid doing, and why. I have found this to be extremely helpful for me. I have six kids, so it is really important to me to be able to really handle my job as a parent well.<br />So far, so good. Using this data has helped me to make good decisions in parenting, and I have been able to avoid so many of the pitfalls other parents fall into.<br />It is by far the best information on child-rearing out there, and can be used by parents from all different cultures and points of view.<br />The section on assists (actions taken to help people who are ill, upset, or have been injured) is likewise invaluable. My older kids have learned how to give assists to others, and they really know what to do now when someone has been hurt! Which, I don't need to tell any experienced parents out there), is a very common occurrence when you're surrounded by toddlers and preschoolers.<br />If one of my children gets upset, I know what to do. If one has a nightmare and wakes up still upset and can't get over it right away, I know what to do. If a child gets ill, I of course take him or her to the doctor, but after that, I can take further steps to help him heal his body, and all that is fully described in this book.<br />I think this book is a lifesaver for parents, and I highly, highly recommend it.	2001-03-13
US	50384836	R1RW03RJS0M8VE	0064433935	613567338	The Lily Cupboard	Books	5	19	20	N	N	Touching story that leaves much unsaid	This story is told rather ambiguously... the facts of the girl going to the country to stay with a family, and where she hides when the soldiers come, is simply told. Why she has to go to the country and why she has to hide, are more complex issues. This story does not attempt to explain all the details and reasons why. Because of this, it is appropriate in the opening of dialogue about WWII and the Holocaust with children of all ages.<br />I could read this story to my 4 year old, or I could have my 9 year old read it. It's not the complete story - but not all children can fully understand or are ready for the complete story.<br />I felt that the information was handled with dignity, and it wasn't told in a maudlin manner at all. As a teacher and mother, I can recommend this book to any child who is ready to learn a little about this tragic time in our history, even the most sensitive students.	2001-03-13

The characters are very unique, and well formed, and the plot is surprisingly smooth. I did not detect any uncomfortable plot devices - the story was very natural, and the narration was interesting and light.<br />Devereaux has a wonderful sense of humor, and a very positive way of looking at people. Her appreciation for different personality types comes through in her writing, and I found this book to be full of characters I could admire. The conflicts were real, but not because of some &quot;evil&quot; person, which I find refreshing.<br />There are lots of shades of grey in life, and in this book, and I appreciate Devereaux's ability to show this to us while maintaining such an overall upbeat attitude.<br />She's really one of the best.	2001-03-08

I don't normally review Kinsale's books because I think they are just too perfectly written for my meager attempts at review, but then that's not fair, is it? So, I'll attempt to put my admiration for this book into words...<br />Jervaulx, the hero of this book, is as flawed and perfectly loveable as all Kinsale's heroes tend to be. And Maddy, our prim and proper heroine, is the typical Victorian miss -- except  for her strong spiritual sense and her impressive reserve of courage and integrity.<br />She is truly an inspirational heroine, in her quiet, unassuming way.<br />One of the things I like best about Kinsale's couples is that the sense of belonging is right there, from the very first meeting. The conflict is most definitely there, but that irrepressible down-deep knowledge and acceptance of the other exists for the heroine and hero both. This is what really makes a romance novel click for me - the ultimate truth of the &quot;rightness&quot; of the relationship, despite all the things that are telling the hero and heroine that it must be &quot;wrong&quot;.<br />Of course, the dialogue, the narration and the plot are very smooth. Just as one would expect from Kinsale, the characters are intense and very real.  <br />I've read this one four times so far, which means the cover is about destroyed, and I'm going to get another copy very soon.<br />Highly recommend for all admirers of romance.	2001-03-08

The book starts with ancient American history and goes through Y2K. Pretty comprehensive.<br />It's written in an easy-to-read format, with chapters and sections clearly outlined, so one can just pick it up and start just about anywhere and read a section.<br />It's pretty condensed, but a great starting point for lots of basic information. It's also not just about wars and other political incidents, but addresses things like the Constitution, Ross Perot, how Rockefeller got started, the end of slavery, the Right to Life movement... like I said, it's really comprehensive.<br />I highly recommend this to anyone who likes history, but doesn't need or want a scholarly tome on the subject.	2001-02-03

(I have six kids, this is my favorite)... a woman sorting through laundry to wash, trying to separate the colors. Laundry is all over the floor in front of the machine.<br />The solution: A frame is built which holds six little trash bins, stacked up one on top of the other, so clothes can be sorted into them by color, without taking up much floor space at all. Then the woman is shown, emptying the whites into the washer - no mess!<br />No words are used but the methods of creating these little organizational solutions are very simple to understand.<br />I am not a handyman (or handywoman) at all, but I really felt these concepts were clear, and we have used several of the solutions presented.<br />Other little gems in this book are: drawing paper dispenser, making a 2-pole closet, creating a nice organizer for rakes, shovels and the like, a neat little stand for roller blades, a ball stacker that goes on the back of a door, and even a baby bottle rack.<br />Every project is simple to do and easy to understand.<br />I recommend this book for any large family! Some of us just need to have every organizational tool we can get our hands on!!	2001-02-03

I do think it is a vital book for anyone who is actively searching through different spiritual philosophies, looking for some answers to the basic questions of existence.    Chapters in this book discuss freedom and why we have barriers. The relationship between the mind, spirit and body. How we can be spiritual beings, yet are in a position where we have limited knowledge and abilities.    This is really intense stuff - and the meat and potatoes of true spiritual philosophy. I find this book to be challenging, yet inspirational to me every time I read it.     I recommend this book to anyone who is awake enough as a spiritual being to pose the questions, \\"Why am I here?\\" and \\"How can I improve my situation?\\"    Happy reading!	2001-02-03

It begins with scientific information about how earthquakes occur, and then goes through what may happen during an earthquake, such as buildings falling down, fires, gas leaks, etc. It goes into further particulars, such as how it feels to be in an earthquake, and what safety measures to take.<br />The illustrations are very simple, and not especially appealing, but they do help illustrate the points well.<br />All in all, a good book for children ages 8 -12 who live in earthquake prone areas, especially.	2001-02-03

Pretty intense. He discusses ways to prevent this from happening to oneself or one's loved ones. Very good information.<br />The five pages he devotes to infant abductions, however, is a bit extreme, I think. In From 1983 to 1996, 89 infant abductions occurred in hospitals. Which, of course, is way too many, but I think that the prioritizing of the issues in this book leaves something to be desired.<br />After reading just a little of it, I began thinking that hospitals were horribly dangerous places to be, and I had to really look at the facts presented in order to see that the presentation of the facts was more horrifying than they needed to be.<br />I really like the advices for how to protect oneself in a hospital, but I think it could have been presented better.	2001-02-03

Ms. Allen breaks down the art of storytelling into 5 minute exercises that are easily done, and that can be linked together to complete longer stories - even full-length novels! By breaking the assignments down into 5 minute exercises, she takes a rather daunting task and turns it into something easily confronted and easily done. She gives lists of exercises which are varied and interesting, and which are geared to really stimulate one's creativity. There is even a section of photographs that one can use as a starting point in their writing. <br />I really enjoyed reading the samples of short shorts which she included, both from unpublished and published writers, and I found her appreciation for her students to be very encouraging.<br />I think she must be a wonderful teacher, and I am actually quite grateful that she has written this book. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys writing, or who thinks they MIGHT enjoy it if given the proper encouragement.	2001-02-03

It is fun to read with nice illustrations, and told in a story-like manner. The problem with that is that it seems very fictional. Why does the author suggest that this is how ancient Egyptians lived? There is not much information about what has been found in ancient Egyptian tombs which verify the author's claims. <br />Perhaps this is fine for children with a passing interest in the subject, but my 9 year old is very skeptical and wants to know WHY it's supposed that Egyptians trained housecats to hunt, for instance.<br />The language is simple enough for 9 year olds, and there is enough to read to make it interesting.	2001-02-03

The 2nd grade book contains poetry (including &quot;The Night Before Christmas), stories (including a section from Charlotte's Web), American tall tales (including Paul Bunyan), Myths from Ancient Greece (10 stories in all), Learning About Language (nouns, verbs, sentences, etc.), and Familiar Saysings and their origins.<br />And that's just the language section.<br />History and geography, visual arts, mathematics, sciences and music are also included in this book. I especially like the history sections in these books. In the 2nd grade book, Civilizations of Asia and Ancient Greece are particularly interesting, with lots of great pictures. The religions of the cultures involved are discussed in a matter-of-fact and respectful manner. The section on ancient Greek politics leads right into the section in American History and democracy. <br />The next logical step is to discuss slavery in the United States, and important facts of the civil rights movement are explained. Civil rights heroes like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks are given attention, and overall it is done with a proper amount of emphasis, and ends on the positive note of changes and improvements in our culture, rather than stopping with the Civil War and leaving it at that.<br />A basic overview of what a 2nd grader should know in terms of math is included, along with illustrations and details of the various mathematical concepts. This is not meant to be a complete math text by any means, but more of a checkout point. Anything the child is behind in can then be noted and remedied, and the basic concepts are there so the parents at least can figure out what needs to be taught.<br />I find the science and visual arts sections to be just a brushover of what should be covered. I only use this information as a starting point, and I find other materials to back these subjects up. <br />This book is very good as part of the overall Core Knowledge curriculum. By itself, it is an incomplete curriculum for a 2nd grader, I think, but it is very good in terms of history, and for the other subjects, I think it is a great starting point.<br />Whether your child is homeschooled, or goes to school outside the home, I think this is a good book to have around, and the entire Core Knowledge series is a sensible starting point for a homeschooler who creates their own curriculum, like I do. I think for all other parents, it is very important to have this book, in order to fill in any gaps in your child's education.	2001-02-03

My 9 year old son is currently studying this book, and I've happily thrown away the grammar materials he was using before. This book is written very clearly, and the data is presented in a straightforward, easy to understand manner.<br />My son now has certainty on the parts of speech, and punctuation. His writing has improved tremendously, and his understanding of what he reads has also improved.<br />This is a must for every homeschooler, and for anyone who found grammar confusing in school. It's not a difficult subject, and not nearly as painful as my elementary school teachers made it seem!<br />I would also recommend this book to anyone whose child is not doing as well in school as they would like. This is certainly the best grammar resource I've found.	2001-02-03

Each problem listed contains a description of symptoms, possible underlying causes of disorder, nutrients which are listed as either essential, very important, important, or helpful for the treatment of the disorder, a description of various herbs which may help, and how to use them, and other recommendations and considerations. <br />For instance, under bronchitis, recommendations includes &quot;drink plenty of fluids. Pure water, herbal teas and soups are all good choices.&quot; and &quot;Add moisture to the air...&quot; Under considerations, bronchodilators are discussed, inhalers are mentioned, and one is advised to get a chest xray if bronchitis &quot;does not clear up in a reasonable amount of time.&quot;<br />There are actually hundreds of disorders listed in this book. It is the most complete reference I have seen for natural remedies, written for the layperson.<br />There is an extensive section on various nutrients, why they are necessary, for what conditions they should be used, and how they should be taken. At the back is a list of manufacturers of the various supplements mentioned.<br />This book certainly does not displace medical care, but it is a good supplement. It is very useful for minor ailments for which one would not want to see a doctor, or for chronic conditions such as endometriosis or chronic fatigue syndrome, which traditional medical practitioners are unable to easily cure.<br />I can highly recommend this one to anyone who takes supplements and wants more information on how to heal the body with natural remedies.	2001-02-03

Why does it happen that as one ages and learns, one becomes less enthusiastic about life? Is there a way to retain one's wisdom, but regain that youthful enthusiasm?<br />Well, there is, and this book gives the exact processes to do just that.<br />These processes are truly remarkable, and very simple to use. Just about anyone could be helped with these processes, but I think they are especially good for someone who has suffered some kind of trauma - the loss of a loved one, for example. <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in what makes us go &quot;tick&quot; and who wants to help others.	2001-02-03

I read &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; in high school, as part of my required reading for history class, but I think this book is much more complete in terms of what actually influenced Hitler, and the undue and horrifying influence the psychiatrists had on civilization.<br />What is even more upsetting is the realization that this same &quot;science&quot; continues to hold power over our culture. The proteges of psychiatrists who advocated horrific &quot;experiments&quot; and treatments including execution, are now influential psychiatrists in practice or in universities. This is frightening, folks, but I think it's important that we take a good long look at this book and the data presented.<br />My thanks to the author for presenting this material in such a compelling manner.	2001-02-03

The motivations of all the characters was stated in an overly straightforward manner - again and again and again. And both the dialogue and narration, as an another reviewer mentioned, were filled with &quot;'twas&quot; and &quot;zounds&quot;, which would have been fine if it did not read in such a stilted manner.<br />The plot was actually quite good, and the characters themselves were interesting and fairly believable (although the heroine's attempted rape seems to have left her curiously unscathed.) All in all this is an acceptable romance novel, at least compared to most in print, but I do think that better editing would have made this a much more enjoyable story.<br />I wouldn't recommend this one unless you really have nothing better to do on a rainy day, but I haven't given up on the author. I think she could do better, and I will read her books again, hoping for better results.	2001-02-03

It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it. <br />It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others. <br />In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.<br />I definitely recommend this one to parents and children.	2001-02-01

Currently he is reading Where the Red Fern Grows, which is generally read by teenagers. My 8 year old is reading Little House on the Prairie and she, too, has had great success in applying the techniques set forth in Learning How to Learn in her own study.<br />If you only purchase one book for your child's education, let it be this one.	2000-09-28

There are a lot of characters, and the plot is rather  complex, and I would imagine that it would be easy to miss out on some of  it if the books aren't read in order.<br />I am impressed with the humor in  these stories, and I think they are great for children.

My M.D. has had many patients on this diet, and  he told me that only 4 of them have been successful in following it with  precision -- and those four individuals are all engineers.<br />The research  that Dr. Sears has done is extensive -- and from the few months that I  followed this diet to the letter, I can say that it works. I felt very,  very good. The only problem is that it does take extensive planning and  continual calculations. I was pregnant with baby #5 at the time, and felt  really good -- but could not continue following a diet so closely for long.  My life is just too busy for that. <br />I did come away from this experience  with a very good idea of what I *should* feed my family, and I do keep  pretty close to this diet with family cooking. I actually do better on  Atkins, personally, so I follow that for myself, while keeping my kids on  more of a Zone diet. I can't say that they are actually &quot;IN&quot; the  Zone at all times, but their diet is much more balanced now than it was  before I got this information.<br />The book can be difficult to understand in  some places. Sears does an excellent job in explaining why this diet works,  but for the layperson it can be an awful lot of information, and a lot of  technical/medical terminology. Be sure to have a good dictionary on hand  when reading this one!<br />It also deals with &quot;macronutrients&quot; -  the relationship of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates and blood sugar and  metabolism. It doesn't go into vitamins and minerals, so in my opinion,  it's only half the story, but an important part of nutrition that is too  often overlooked. It should be helpful to anyone with blood sugar or  metabolic disorders, such as diabetes, hypoglycemia, obesity, that sort of  thing. It's also a diet that ANYONE (not just overweight or ill) people can  use safely and with great results.<br />I would recommend that EVERYONE read  this book, and decide if this diet will work for them, based on their  experiences.	2000-08-07

A bridge with water running under it and cars driving over it become,  when upside down, a fence with electric poles and wires running alongside  and stars in the sky above!

There were a few instances of kissing (one  while rolling on the grass) while his girlfriend was kept in the dark.<br />I  don't know about other readers, but I can't admire a hero who cheats on his  girlfriend, or a heroine who steals a man from another woman.<br />I have  another book by Spencer waiting for me to read, and I don't know if I'll  bother.	2000-07-24

In  the style of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, the &quot;bad guy&quot; confesses all,  and long drawn out conversations ensue -- all while the &quot;bad guy&quot;  is holding the gun and we're waiting for him to pull the trigger. I find  this particularly irritating in a story. Maybe criminals actually do  confess all and engage in an interview with their intended victims about  their motivations and how they did what they did, just before they plan to  kill them, but it doesn't seem real to me. I had the feeling that the  writer was taking the easy way out of unfolding a rather complicated story  by letting the criminal spill the beans this way.<br />I was also a bit  disturbed by the ease the main characters had in falling into bed with one  another. There wasn't enough sexual tension, and the whole sex thing seemed  just a bit too casual for my taste. Because of the backgrounds of both the  hero and heroine, I felt that there was a whole lot of depth to these  characters that I never got to see, which was disappointing.<br />Krentz does  have a strong talent -- the writing is smooth, but it seems as though she  rushed through this story, and brushed over some failings in the plot.  <br />This is the 2nd story by her that I've read -- I'm intrigued enough to  keep reading, I am sure she is capable of writing some very good stories,  even though this one was a bit disappointing.	2000-07-13

Dress up for a masquerade --  in the tub. Dine with him -- in the tub. <br />The lyrics are cute, but the  best part of this story is, without a doubt, the beautiful illustrations.  <br />This one is a keeper.	2000-07-13

He's a charming sort of hero -- the lost, brainy sort of fellow, surrounded by people who can't appreciate his abilities, but who manages to find his own kind and use his talents to  save the day.<br />This book is very funny, written with a definite British  sort of humor. I am pleased to know that so many children are growing up  with this book. It's not &quot;dumbed down&quot; like many popular  children's books (particularly for this age group) are today.<br />My 9 year  old son had gotten bored with Goosebumps and the like, and he was really  ready to move on. From the first page in this book he was saying,  &quot;Mom, this is really funny!&quot;<br />The first chapter was a bit slow,  I thought, but the story really picked up after that. I finished this book  myself and went right out to buy #2 in the series. I can recommend this one  for any child -- or adult -- who who likes imaginative, funny stories, and  doesn't mind a bit of the absurd.	2000-07-13

I thought it was a great find -- free textbooks! I soon realized that not only was this book too dumbed down for  my 1st grader (I homeschool), it was too dumbed down for my 4 year  old.<br />For instance, I just flipped the book open and find, &quot;You can  see shapes. You can feel shapes. You can use shapes. Shapes help you learn.  What shapes do you see in the picture?&quot; That is an entire page of this  &quot;textbook&quot; -- the entire book is written at that level.<br />It  might be a really good tool to use with a 3 year old. It is not something I  would ever insult a 2nd grader with. I cannot stretch my imagination to the  extent of understanding how any teacher of 7 year old children could find  this book useful at all. <br />My advice is to skip this one, unless you're  looking for a really good reason to doubt the sense of textbook publishers  and public schools.	2000-06-28

Some of the advice is basic (Revlon cosmetics are less expensive at K-Mart) to some things one  really might not know (the time to buy audio equipment is between January  and April).<br />This book is full of 1-800 numbers for catalogs and other  information. I would have liked some website addresses, but the book was  published in 1996 -- can't have everything!<br />The best thing about this  book is that I DIDN'T pay retail -- I picked it up for $3.99.

My 9 year old son read this book, and so I read it, too, so we could discuss it together. It's a very engaging story. My son read it in a day - he couldn't put it down, and I found that I couldn't, either.<br />There are  some very good themes in this book -- the main character is very strong,  determined, and survives despite having the odds stacked against her. One  thing in particular that I liked is how she doesn't necessarily learn how  to do new things with great speed -- but she keeps at it until she has  learned a new skill, and is successful at it. I think this is a  particularly good thing for children to read about. Not all skills are  immediate, and working to achieve proficiency is worthwhile.<br />Other major  themes are the importance of voting, the rights of women, the ability of  girls to learn to do jobs formerly considered only fit for boys, facing  fears in order to overcome subjugation and make a better life for oneself,  and growing up without parents. Slavery is touched on.<br />This book lends  itself to the discussion of any of these topics, and my son and I had some  very good talks as a result.<br />I did feel the story ended a little  abruptly. I was completely unprepared for it to be over, I was hoping more  would be explained, and I felt dissatisfied after finishing the book. <br />I  must say that I also felt a bit uncomfortable reading about the woman whom  the story is actually based on. (She lived her life as a man, and it wasn't  discovered until after her death that she was female.) While this book  presents topics for children to discuss that are interesting and  worthwhile, I don't know that all parents would feel that this book is  appropriate for their children to read. <br />I would suggest that parents  read the back of the book first, before handing it to the children to read.  Be prepared for some questions!	2000-06-19

I'm not much of a cook, and with a family of 8 to cook for, having to prepare Atkins meals for myself was trying.<br />This cookbook really increased the different types of meals I am eating, and broadened my scope  of foods considerably. When I found myself having extreme cravings for  chocolate and sugar, the dessert recipes were a definite help! <br />The  recipes are simple, the ingredients aren't so obscure or expensive as to  render the recipes useless, and the cooking time is minimal. <br />I loaned my  copy of the book to a friend -- and haven't gotten it back! She had been on  the Atkins way of eating for 3 years, and was going crazy with the monotony  of it. This book salvaged her as far as Atkins is concerned. <br />I highly  recommend this book to anyone on Atkins, especially anyone with a busy  lifestyle without a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.	2000-06-19

Books	5	34	34	N	N	My favorite of Vonnegut's works	Vonnegut himself said he couldn't decide if this book was his worst - or his best.<br />I love this one and it's my favorite Vonnegut book.<br />In it he actually discusses his own life a good bit, and his relationship with his  sister, with whom he was very close. I felt like I had a much better idea  of who Vonnegut is after reading this one. <br />The two main characters are  very engaging, and the story is classic Vonnegut -- you gotta love people  despite all their faults. The story is post-Apocalyptic, as so many of his  stories are, but it has a more positive feel to it than many of them,  despite the poor circumstances the people are in. <br />The message that life  goes on is a hopeful one. I found the relationship between the main  characters to be very thought-provoking. I think the critics vilified this  one when it was first published, and I can't say that if you like Vonnegut  you'll love this one -- because even some of his fans didn't like this one  so much.<br />But if you like the idea of 2 soulmates being better together  than they are separately, and if you've a fondness for the idiosyncracies  of geniuses, you might like this one as much as I did.	2000-06-18

His younger brothers (ages 5 and 2) also liked  it, and my 2 year old can now name at least 75 Pokemon by sight as a  result!<br />I think it's a good, fun tool for the kids in that it develops  their memory.

The book is rather small -- no  long, drawn-out story, but it communicates the story well, with a beautiful  sort of grace.<br />I felt I understood the culture better, and the characters  were very real to me. Their story was touching. The ending, which is the  type which normally would leave me feeling dissatisfied, did not. It's not  the perfectly happy, romantical type ending, which I normally like, but  instead it shows that even when the fairy tale does NOT come true, life can  be blessed and well worth living.<br />My children will read this one for  sure.	2000-06-15

During my second pregnancy, I actually gave my copy away to a friend. I, like another reviewer here, found it needlessly alarmist, but that has to do with my  philosophy of pregnancy and childbirth. <br />I think if there is reason for a  woman to be concerned about a troublesome pregnancy or birth, then this  book could provide some good, basic information. Also, any woman who really  trusts the standard medical protocol regarding childbirth and pregnancy,  will probably like this book.<br />For women who tend to question EVERYTHING  their doctor or midwife does, they will not like this book! Just about  everything that can go wrong is discussed and the standard procedures that  doctors do are not questioned.<br />For the rebellious mother, I would advise  that you skip this one and get &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot; and  one of the books by Dr. Brewer.<br />And have a happy pregnancy and birth!	2000-06-15

Nothing advanced, just basic stuff.<br />This book was great for me, because it gave me lots of basic html codes and it's all right there, easy to find  and easy to understand. I couldn't for the life of me understand frames  before this book, but how to do frames was explained so well that I had to  laugh at the troubles I had had with them in the past.<br />This book also  gets into some more advanced stuff, such as style sheets, and dynamic html.  I had no experience in any of this, and I found that these things were not  explained well enough for a novice such as myself to fully understand. I  got lost. <br />Someone with SOME experience in these other things might find  this book to be a great resource for dynamic html, but it was a bit too  much of a jump for me. For a beginning web page developer, this is a good  resource for the extensive html coding it presents. I can't say about the  more advanced programming, as it wasn't helpful to me personally.	2000-06-12

I come from a family of public  school teachers, and I am a homeschooler, partly because of what I have  heard from the p.s. teachers in my family. There are problems inherent in  the public school systems, and in this book, many of them are  delineated.<br />Sykes briefly touches on the impact of psychological and  psychiatric programs in the schools, but I think he fails to realize that  they are actually BEHIND many of the other problems.

I tended towards the  simpler &quot;snack&quot; recipes, partly because some of the other ones  did take more time to prepare.<br />I've also got a large family (at the time  I had 4 children) so the recipes had to be increased a good bit for my  family. Which wasn't a huge problem, but some of the meals were just too  expensive to make for so many.<br />There are some great egg recipes in there,  and very easy to fix snacks, and it's all thought out and balanced, which,  of course, is a definite plus for staying in the Zone.<br />The recipes were  very easy to follow and understand, even for a novice cook such as myself.

My hips were particularly bad, and bending over was nearly impossible for me without terrible pain. Imagine that -- with 5 young  children to pick up after!<br />During one pregnancy I was in a wheelchair due  to this pain, and even after the births, the pain was never completely  gone.<br />I spent thousands of dollars at the chiropractor, and found no  relief until I tried prolotherapy and these exercises. I had only one  prolotherapy treatment when I became pregnant again, and so couldn't  continue the treatments. I felt better, but still had a disabling pain in  my hips.<br />I actually only did the Pain Free exercises 4 times -- over a  period of 3 weeks -- but that was all that was necessary to completely  eliminate all the hip pain I had been having for YEARS.<br />What is even more  remarkable, is that 3 of the times I did the exercises I was 8+ months  pregnant, and once was soon after the birth, so I couldn't do all of  them.<br />Even still, just the little bit that I COULD do was wonderful! <br />I  recommend this book to everyone I know who has back problems.

Kids can really relate to the humor -- Amelia Bedelia finds herself  in trouble over misunderstanding the dual meanings of words.<br />This is a  good illustration of what not understanding the full meaning of a word can  do to a person (and all the trouble that it can create) and it's something  that every child has come across at some point or another.<br />It is  ridiculous and funny, and what kid doesn't like ridiculous and funny?  <br />This is a good one, particularly for girls, I think, since the Amelia is  female, and there don't seem to be as many books out there starring women  or girls as there should be.	2000-06-01

They are naturally helpful and happy, but this book has helped me to reinforce positive  behaviors in my children even more.<br />It comes with a gameboard that sticks  to the fridge, and little magnetic pieces. We had to get some extra pieces,  since we had 5 kids playing the game and only 2 pieces that came with it.  We just got some little magnets from Radio Shack, which work  great.<br />Here's how it works: each left-hand page shows a negative behavior  (such as a kid throwing his dirty clothes on the floor) and on the opposite  side is the positive behavior (the kid putting the clothes in the hamper).  No words -- just the pictures. <br />This may seem boring, but my kids have  spent HOURS perusing this book, ON THEIR OWN, and discussing the actions  with one another.<br />We use the game by moving each child's piece forward  one square everytime they do something helpful and positive. We don't  &quot;punish&quot; for negative behaviors, just reward the positive ones.  When they get to the end of the game they get a prize -- I keep a box of  books, candy, little toys, etc., that they can choose from.<br />This is a  WONDERFUL system and a WONDERFUL book.

The technological concepts are sound, but this is not a book about machines. <br />It's about the triumph of good over evil.

The humor actually  got past me completely until the 3rd time I read this book -- then I  realized it is REALLY funny!<br />This is a very long book -- but there are  many themes interwoven throughout, and each time I read this book, I see  more and more in it to think about. <br />It's a positive tale, similar to the  old classics in which the hero is truly heroic. Some of the tongue-in-cheek  might indeed be missed by the reader, but even still it is a good story.  For those who understand the humor in it, it's a great story.<br />I highly  recommend this one!	2000-06-01

You want your children to understand references to  literature. You want your children to know what others are talking about  when they refer to a mythological figure.<br />These books not only provide  the parent with a few basic stories, but they also put it in the mind of  the parent that these things are important for the child to come into  contact with. <br />The social studies are nice and simple, with little maps  and nice little pictures. For my children, I develop checksheets to go  along with them -- they read a section in the book, then they draw a  picture relating to it, or look at a globe and point out the place under  discussion, or create an animal from that part of the world in clay --  something involving DOINGness, instead of just READING. They really love  this and it makes the material stick in their minds that way.<br />I make a  checklist out of the math section, to verify that the kids are up to speed.  <br />Overall, I think these are valuable books, and well worth having. I  would warn parents to watch for the vocabulary used in the literature --  kids will get confused if many of the words are not defined for them - the  literacy level is pretty high per each grade level.	2000-06-01

My hips were particularly bad, and bending over was nearly impossible for me without terrible pain. Imagine that -- with 5 young  children to pick up after!<br />During one pregnancy I was in a wheelchair due  to this pain, and even after the births, the pain was never completely  gone.<br />I spent thousands of dollars at the chiropractor, and found no  relief until I tried prolotherapy and these exercises. I had only one  prolotherapy treatment when I became pregnant again, and so couldn't  continue the treatments. I felt better, but still had a disabling pain in  my hips.<br />I actually only did the Pain Free exercises 4 times -- over a  period of 3 weeks -- but that was all that was necessary to completely  eliminate all the hip pain I had been having for YEARS.<br />What is even more  remarkable, is that 3 of the times I did the exercises I was 8+ months  pregnant, and once was soon after the birth, so I couldn't do all of  them.<br />Even still, just the little bit that I COULD do was wonderful! <br />I  recommend this book to everyone I know who has back problems. Egoscue is  wonderful and has really made it possible for me to improve my life! I feel  I owe him a great deal for this.	2000-06-01

I just read it for the 3rd time, in anticipation of Battlefield Earth, the movie. Each time the read was even better than the last.<br />It was action-packed!<br />I cried at a few points, and laughed at  many others. This book was really a lot of fun to read.<br />If you like  science fiction, and you like adventure, then I highly recommend this one!	2000-05-05

I want to meet characters who are complex and not easily understood on the surface. I want the entire book to be an unravelling of the personalities involved -- I  want to know the hero as well as I know my own husband, and I want to know  the heroine as well as I know myself. And I want to love them both.<br />This  book does not disappoint.<br />Kinsale shows an incredible sense of compassion  for people by the way she portrays human frailty. I don't think many  writers could create a character like Ruck -- puppy-like in his loyalty to  a woman who didn't even know he existed. Or Melanthe, beautiful, cold and  cruel. <br />How could a doormat like Ruck be a hero we could fall in love  with? How could an unfeeling, selfish heroine like Melanthe be someone we  could identify with?<br />Only Laura Kinsale could weave a story around these  two characters that allows us to understand them so fully. She reminds me  of the basic goodness of people, and she reminds me that sometimes there is  a lot more to people than meets the eye.	1999-12-28
