Reading reviews of this book, I see that we're playing a kind of 'emperor's new clothes game' in which few people are willing to stand up and say, 'Hello, people! This stuff is BAD.&quot; It is bad, not cool and out of the box and chic and trend setting. Just bad.	2003-10-06

A small book with lots of small pictures. Kind of disappointing. Other books on cottages and second homes do the job getter. I have found these are my favorites:<BR> * Second Home: Finding Your Place in the Fun. This is comprehensive, large, with great shots of homes in all styles and shots of their settings too. Great to look at but filled with tips on everyting from finding a location to decorating.<BR> * The Cabin. Gorgeous, big pictures, lots of variety in the cabins shown.

My husband and I both have careers, and we both could use this kind of information for ways to keep our house better. However, this weighty tome is extremely difficult to use. You can't simply turn to a section and get the tips you need. Also, the author, who (to be honest) (...)has no background in this area, writes about herself, and, to be honest, I don't care about her thoughts or her life. I just want the information. I mean, if I have a stain in a sink or want some information on where to put the dessert spoon when I set the table, I don't want to wade through irrelevant ramblings from the writer. So, the bottom line is this: This is a good topic. But this is a BAD book.	2001-12-06

My husband and I both &quot;keep house,&quot; and we both need help. This book is so well organized that I've already learned I can quickly turn to whatever I need. The book is blissfully brief also as the information is boiled down into clear but simple tips. I expected lots of cleaning and care information, which the book includes, but I was pleasantly surprised with the bonus information on buying furnishings or appliances, setting the table, writing a thank-you note. I liked the section on organizing and storage too. My only complaint is that the book came shrink-wrapped, so I couldn't see what I was getting (and how complete this book is) until I paid for it and opened it up. I bought it on faith because it was done by the Better Homes and Gardens people, and I'm glad I did. This book is solving one other problem for me----what to give friends for birthdays or what to take to wedding showers. It's a great gift book.	2001-12-06

(I logged on to order a copy for a friend's first-home housewarming.) I have to agree with a recent reviewer who said that she likes the fact that the book is filled with classic design. The book does have more cottage, country, and traditional rooms in it than contemporary ones, and that suits me (I am an early 30-something). My friends and I (local friends and college friends who now live in Connecticut, Chicago, Denver) are all much more traditional than my mother and her friends who grew up on contemporary design in the 1960s and 1970s.	2001-01-30

Both books, however, make me feel that I am simply looking through a window at something I cannot have. I find I prefer a new book called Second Home, because it offers the same kind of yummy dreamlike quality yet talks to me about how I can make my getaway dream come true. If you can afford a stack of books on retreats, add this Family Houses volume to the pile. If you can only afford one or two books, I highly recommend Second Home instead.	2001-01-18

I have looked long and hard for such a book, and I usually come up with books that are either about building a log home or those about locations that have nothing to do with my life. In contrast, this book does it all. I am so inspired by the homes featured, and my husband keeps grabbing the book away from me. Beyond the great photography are all the helpful tips on choosing, building,and  decorating a second home. I can afford to dream about our second home, because this book makes me believe that I can make the dream come true.	2000-11-20

The other book we've just gotten and love is Better Homes and Gardens Second Home, which takes us on a tour of wonderful homes in the U.S. and gives ideas about how to shop for, build, remodel, decorate our own second home.

This Cabin Fever book is a bit narrower in scope, but I am enjoying all the photos.    Because I love Better Homes and Gardens Cottage Style, I just bought the new BH&amp;G book called Second Home, which shows one great house after another. I'm getting lots of decorating ideas from those homes. But Second Home also has great information on real estate shopping, home design, and decorating, too. It's my kind of book, because it's a dream book that also helps me do something to achieve the dream.	2000-10-19

She called from college to tell me that was a mistake. Her class tore this book apart, apparently due to the fact that the book is filled with the kind of opinionated bias that journaism students are taught to avoid at all costs. My daughter says that her professors are concerned about Americans' eroding confidence in the news media and that this kind of book fuels that lack of confidence. &quot;We're told to present just the facts as impartially as possible,&quot; my daughter said, &quot;and to keep our opinions to ourselves.&quot; I guess that Mr. O'Reilly did not study journalism.

The book makes me realize that he's fun on TV but probably not a great design authority. The rooms he would have us create are too-too. Looking at my friends' homes and at my own, what I see is that we have too much darned stuff. And we talk about needing to clean up the clutter and simplify our surroundings so that we can relax. Mr.Lowell seems to want us to add something everywhere we look. I guess I am looking for something more sophisticated than what this book can teach me. One thing that scares me is how many of my less-than-talented friends are going to use this book as a license to junk up their homes.	2000-10-02

I found her premise snobbish, because she clearly thinks  that she'sjust discovered this idea and that the rest of us still need to  be told or convinced that putting our personalities into our homes is the  thing to do. She is way behind the times and seems to just be catching on  to what the rest of us have been doing in our homes for many years now.

Mistake. The  idea of learning about and expressing your own taste is covered so much  better in so many other decorating books. This is very hard to use, as an  earlier reviewer said.

Many of the  interiors have a dated quality. And they tend to all be neutral with lots  of wood and an overriding Craftsman look. The point of the book is great,  but I'd love a book that shows me small houses in a wider range of styles.  How about something slick and modern? Or how about showing a traditional  Cape?

You don't have time for it. If you did everything the book suggests, you would drive yourself crazy, not to mention have to quit your job and go on welfare! If you're a  parent, you will not have time for parenting but only for cleaning!  Seriously, there is much good information in the book but it is TOO MUCH. I  thought that HOME COMFORTS would be warm and fuzzy and comforting. Instead,  it's yo-yo-heave-ho. It's like an old fashioned textbook with too much  writing, and I discovered that finding the information you want is not easy  at all. I don't see this as a validation of homemaking and housework but a  throwback to a time when the little woman was supposed to stay home and  scrub, scrub, scrub. This book is detrimental because it promotes the kind  of guilt and anxiety (the feeling that one is never doing ENOUGH in terms  of keeping the house perfect) that today's women (working or not) do not  need. I'm trying to clear up the clutter in my life, not add to it with  more to-do lists. And, believe me, this book will inspire you to write one  anxiety-producing to-do list after another. I know many frantic women who  are juggling work and homes and kids and spouses plus caring for their own  parents, and this kind of book would simply drive them nuts. Personally,  I'll donate my copy to a local charity book sale. I will feel relieved just  to get this book out of the house. Whew!	2000-07-20

What he says may not be new, but the way he says it is. He addresses common problems and offers direct advice while also making us  laugh at ourselves. An earlier reviewer missed the point when he/she said  the book seemed &quot;aimed at people who live in ideal houses with some  old style charm or super modern chic.&quot; Wrong!

If you think &quot;Disney for Adults&quot; or &quot;Golden Book for  Grownups,&quot; you'll understand what these books offer. I was given a set  of 4 Mitford paperbacks, which I read in a couple of evenings. I found them  relaxing and even sleep-inducing, which isn't all bad. Fine writing and  fine fiction? Of course not. Given the stress in the world today, I  understand the popularity of books like these that are utterly undemanding,  emotionally or intellectually. The hunger for these (as expressed in many  customer reviews) does say something sad about the emptiness of people's  lives -- so empty that they must fill them with these shallow fictional  characters? Because of the bland nature of these books, they make a good  gift for someone in the hospital. Just be sure the personal you give them  to is Christian, because the books will offend those of other faiths with  the idea that perhaps the author is trying to convert them!	2000-07-18

That isn't possible for us right now, but this book, Cottage Style, is helping me give our suburban house that weekend-house look. At first, I thought cottage style was just  one decorating look, but it isn't. It includes LOTS of looks (farmhouse,  Adirondack, and so on) with one thing in common: giving any home that  &quot;getaway feeling,&quot; as the author explains. The book is just  great. I'm planning right now on how to turn our family room into the  northwoods &quot;cabin&quot; that my husband and I have always wanted.

Interesting that the author shows  very expensive homes of wealthy people yet has designed a collection of  getaway furniture for a low-end furniture maker whose products would never  appear in the homes shown in the book.

The author has the focus right  -- this is about creating personal style, not about buying junk.	2000-04-03

I see now. I want a home that's homey, comfortable, charming, relaxing, timeless, and simple, and this book has  captured that. Like an earlier reviewer, I was surprised too that there was  so much variety within cottage style. I like the big color pictures but  also the idea that the author has explained decorating principles so I can  not just copy the rooms I see but create my own look. The book is lovable,  and I hope my rooms will be the same. My problem now is that I pick up the  book and end up sitting back and just daydreaming with it instead of  getting going on decorating. A pleasure to look at.	2000-03-29

If you want more options, my favorite new book of the spring season is Flea Market Decorating, which for me captures the fun of finding flea market  treasures and then using to create highly personal rooms that range from  cottage to contemporary.	2000-03-29

(Why doesn't amazon show thebook's cover? ) The book is fun, sophisticated, full of fresh ideas, and beautifully photographed. I liked being taken to flea markets around the  country and to see how some of the objects found at those flea markets were  used in decorating real rooms. If you love antiquing and flea marketing,  you'll love this book. It conveys the thrill of the hunt and the fun of  decorating, too.	2000-03-23

There's no nice way to say this, but maybe there is a new money-old money difference in perception here. What I see in the book is one gorgeous and  highly livable room after another. Lively, vibrant, personal and  comfortable homes obviously used by real people. What I didn't expect was  that I would pick up as many decorating ideas for my own home as I did.	2000-03-14

This book is a big, big disappointment.The pretty picturers don't reflect the real stuff that most of us live with and must organize. In other words, the book is not really  about &quot;organizing the stuff of life,&quot; as it promises. And  regarding the previous review, who is Julie Morgenstein? Never heard of  her.	2000-03-02

I never plan to sew anything, so that's not what I wanted. I'm glad I happened on this book, because it's about decorating with fabrics and wall  coverings, not simply stitching up a pillow or slipcovers. Now I can plan  my decorating scheme and leave the sewing to my seamstress.	2000-03-01

I can't live by the sea now, so I'm supplementing this book with a decorating book called Cottage Style which is all about  decorating with such vacation-home looks in mind.	2000-02-28

If you want little crafty projects, the book is fine; if you want a decorating book, look elsewhere.	2000-02-24

One gets the idea that this author has just discovered that it's OK  not to be &quot;in,&quot; when most of us who love our homes reached that  conclusion long ago. I thumbed through and picked up a tone that suggested  that the author has set herself above the rest of us. A definite turnoff to  anyone who already loves her home and has a strong sense of style.	2000-02-22

An idea-filled book about redecorating and remodeling basements. I love the gorgeous photography and all the planning tips. I think the previous reviewer misunderstood the book -- obviously,this is not a  do-it-yourself &quot;build-a-wall&quot; kind of book. (There is plenty of  that at the bookstore already.) This book is helping me see all the options  and plan how we want our basement to look and function. It's even giving me  tips on finding a contractor who will do the work. And my husband loves the  specific projectg ideas with actual COSTS included so we can figure out if  the estimates we get are reasonable or not. Love the room arranging kit  that comes in the book, too. (Can you tell I love this book?)	2000-02-17

I know, because when I signed up for an interior design class at a local junior college, the textbook was The New Decorating Book put out by Better Homes  and Gardens. It covers balance, scale, and so on and also includes  furniture templates for furniture arranging. And it has hundreds of  excellent color pictures.	2000-01-24

I figured someone was trying to tell me something! I got it at the store, only to see that it's cheaper at  amazon. Oh well. I'm glad I bought this book, because it is relevant and  current, as the previous reviewer said. I'm really excited about all the  ideas in the book, and I can see that it's also going to teach me all those  decorating basics that I need. I didn't expect this from Better Homes and  Gardens, but I must admit that I don't read the magazine. The book is over  400 pages and full of great color photos of very stylish rooms. A bargain!	2000-01-19

A roomful of musty old furniture with peeling paint and faded fabrics had some appeal a decade ago, but enough already.

Some good tips, but I'll take this book back to the store.  Here's my recommendation: For Xmas I received The New  Decorating Book, which gives me more help and also seems pretty focused on  the way most of us decorate using the things we have-it is telling me how  things go together, and it also has a realistic look and lots of big color  pictures obviously taken in real homes.	2000-01-18

It's OK if you are just starting out in life and have the luxury of buying things that naturally go together. In that case, the premise that you can cut clutter  by displaying your possessions (because they're all the same color) works.  Unfortunately, most of us own and love a variety of objects, such as gifts  and family heirlooms, and those things don't always go together naturally.  So, Ithink the authors cheated a bit, making it easy on themselves by  showing us how to group those things that do, of course, go together. The  book seems to be more a statement of a certain style (white, white, white)  instead of delivering what it promises in terms of storage help.	2000-01-17

I thought I was buying a pretty dream book to get me through the winter, but now I've put Post-it Notes on page after  page so I don't forget all the ideas I'm getting. The first thing I'm going  to do is paint the old brown paneling in our den, slipcover the couch, and  put up some lace curtains. As I said, I just love this book.	2000-01-11

The pictures are gorgeous and include a wide range of styles, and the writing quickly and simply what you need to  know to pull your own rooms together. The quizzes are fun, too. It's the  best book for people who like me who want inspiration, information, and a  little respect. This book shows me the options and talks to me like a  friend so I can do things MY way. It's great.	2000-01-07
