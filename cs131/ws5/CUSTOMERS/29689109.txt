Twenty-one years later, he's still in the SCA and even serves on its Board of Directors. <br /> <br />Although it's been more than fifteen years since I was an active SCA member, I do remember fondly some of the time I spent as an adolescent in the Society, and I read this book as a means to reminiscence.  This little book is a terrific mystery yarn that is also a very accurate portrayal of the nuances of SCA society and culture.  I don't know if a non-SCA person would want to read it, though---it might be too confusing.  But to current and former SCA folk, this is a terrific read, and it also shows that SCA folk on whole are just \\"regular people\\" with a rather unusual hobby.	2005-04-30

Make sure you read the three CRYSTAL SINGER books in the proper order (CRYSTAL SINGER first, then KILLASHANDRA, then CRYSTAL LINE)---if you don't, you'll have a hard time following what is going on.  This end to the trilogy does have a few minor flaws and inconsistencies, but as always with McCaffrey's writing, her plot and universe is so compelling, you'll keep reading anyway.	2005-04-28

I think this book has some flaws but it is still a very worthy read for SF/F fans.  I know Matthew Hughes' work mostly from the short stories he has published in THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION.  My favorite stories from that mag involve the noonaut Guth Bandar, a scholar who travels the Commons---the dreamscape of all human achetypes and experiences. (Think Carl Jung's collective unconscious).    I have not read the two novels that precede BLACK BRILLION, but I am familiar with the Old Earth universe via the Guth Bandar short stories.  I have to admit that I did not get into this book at all until about 50 pages in or so, when Guth Bandar shows up and throws a monkey wrench in the main character's undercover police operation.  When Bandar and the Commons become involved in the story, it gets a lot more interesting.  And the last 100 pages are a total page-turner---I stayed up late to finish the book.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with the ending---it seemed a little too tacked-on for such a complex narrative.    Still, I am glad I read this book.  I think Matt Hughes is a very talented writer we should see a lot more of, and that this book is well worth purchasing in hardcover.    BTW, I am no relation to Matt Hughes.  Just a coincidence that we have the same last name.	2005-04-19

Great for a lazy day around the house or at the beach.  I read it in almost one sitting.  The story is hilarious, and does a fantastic job of satirizing the guilty pleasures of reality television, plus also gives a realistic depiction of the struggles plus-sized women go through in our current culture.  Very funny, wacky, and touching.  I recommend this book to all chick-lit lovers!	2005-04-17

For me, it ranks right up there with THE COLOR PURPLE and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES AT THE WHISTLE STOP CAFE.  A very touching story of turbulent-yet-close relationship between two young girls and the events that swirl around them.  Beautifully written and executed.  Also has an element of mystery.  I definitely recommend this book highly---you will stay up late to finish it!!!	2005-03-27
US	29689109	R3GQJWAFVFO9NU	0743418204	418870210	In Her Shoes: A Novel	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Jennifer Weiner is the chick lit genre's best writer!	I believe that Jennifer Weiner is doing a lot to elevate the \\"chick lit\\" genre above its current pulp status into a legitimate form of literature.  Her strength by far is her amazing skill at characterization.  You get inside the heads of every character in this book---from the main heroines Rose and Maggie to the many supporting roles.  Like an Oscar-caliber movie with a good ensemble cast, Weiner draws you in and makes you care deeply for all of these characters---even the scummy ex-boyfriend Jim, who dates Rose while bedding Rose's sister Maggie---by exposing the dark reasons behind all their personal flaws. <br /> <br />Also, when it comes to mixing dark, poignant emotional tragedy with flippant humor, Weiner can't be beat, and IN HER SHOES is no exception.  This was the first Weiner book I read, and she has found a fan for life.  I will be sure to follow every book she releases from now on.	2004-11-17

Still, the historical information Plaidy has gathered in this novel makes it worth reading despite the plodding pace of the plot.  Very little has been written about Henry VIII's sister Margaret, and I found the historical details of how a young noblewoman lived day-by-day and how she had to scheme and plot just to keep her children quite interesting.<br /><br />Not on my Top 10 list, but educational.  I'd recommend checking it out of your local library before I'd recommend buying it.	2004-10-08
US	29689109	R1PDOIDC4HLGWA	0671656155	890769453	The Fall of Atlantis	Books	3	49	50	N	N	Not one of her best, but IMPORTANT to read nonetheless	This is one of MZB's earliest novels, and you can tell she wrote it early in her career, because the quality of the writing is not up to par with her later books (e.g., the MISTS trilogy).  However, this book is ESSENTIAL reading for someone who wants to get the most out of the MISTS OF AVALON series of books----so much of what is contained in those books, especially THE FOREST HOUSE and LADY OF AVALON, relates directly to the plot of THE FALL OF ATLANTIS.  So, pick it up now that it's back in print, and enjoy!	2004-10-08
US	29689109	R3VM0MO9HQBA2S	0765307995	427293527	Bonnie and Clyde: A Love Story	Books	4	3	5	N	N	Beautiful writing, interesting speculative history	What this book has to offer more than anything else is that it focuses on Bonnie and Clyde's romantic relationship (as well as the relationships Bonnie has with other men) instead of their crime sprees---which have been done to death.  I picked this book up at my local library hoping to learn something new about Bonnie & Clyde (I've been a buff of their story for many years) and this book does have plenty of new insight to offer, as well as some very creative \\"what-if\\" historical fiction that Brooks is quite famous for.   <br /> <br />It's a quick, easy read that is filled with some lovely, artistic phrasing.  Great for reading on the train or at the beach, but still has a lot of substance and history.	2004-10-04

I believe THE FOREST HOUSE is the weakest of the three---although I love all of them.  WHat may be causing a problem for some is the fact that this novel refers heavily to one of MZB's early, little-read novels, THE FALL OF ATLANTIS.  I recommend everyone read THE FALL OF ATLANTIS (it's recently come back into print) before reading LADY OF AVALON; the plot will be a lot more interesting and make a lot more sense if you have the Atlantean background given in FALL OF ATLANTIS to make sense of a lot of the ancient Avalon lore, as well as the understanding that the three souls that keep getting reincarnated in each era (The Son of Kings, Isarma, Dierna) are actually traceable back to FALL OF ATLANTIS.	2004-10-04

I read Futureland earlier this year and when I saw that his latest novel, THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT, was not part of his mystery series I grabbed it from my local library.  This novel is mesmerizing---I read it very nearly straight through.  The main character Charles is despicable in many ways---lazy, selfish, corrupt, a thief, a womanizer---and yet Moseley makes us like him---mostly because Charles is very, very funny. <br /> <br />Mr. Bennet, who Charles agrees to allow to stay in his basement in a makeshift prison cell in exchange for a pile of cash, on the other hand, is pure evil.  Compared to Bennet, Charles is a saint, and as Charles gets to know just how evil Bennet is, it helps bring about his own redemption.  The kinds of evil Bennet is involved in gives me chills even several weeks after reading the book.  An excellent study in the real definition of evil and responsibility.	2004-10-03

For anyone who loves the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, this is a gorgeously written end to the series, which ties up all the loose ends nicely.  It is less concerned with Precious Ramotswe's detective work than the personal lives of Precious, Mr. J.L.B. Matakone, Precious' secretary, etc.  A lovely, life-affirming book.  I recommend all the books in this series---truly wonderful, joyful prose, for mystery lovers and literary lovers alike.    Another thing you will appreciate about these books is their detailed look into the daily life of Botswana.	2004-08-10

Several of the stories (The Man in the Black Suit, Everything's Eventual, and The Death of Jack Hamilton) are of literary quality.  The rest are largely a return to the tight, well-crafted short stories that marked King's early career. <br /> <br />The only piece I did not like was the Dark Tower story.  Never been a Dark Tower fan.  Even so, there is something in this collection for everyone.	2004-08-10

I'll keep it brief, since there are plenty of other reviews here, but hands-down, one of the best books I've read in the past ten years.  The prose is pure joy.  The mysteries Precious Ramotswe uncovers in her detective work are wonderful looks inside African culture and the human psyche.  The humor is life-affirming and lovely.  Read this book first, then the whole series.  You'll be glad you did!!!	2004-08-10

Unpredictable and funny, and also sensitively examines the difficult subject of adopted children's struggles to come to terms with their birth mothers' giving them up, mourning the death of a birth mother the heroine never knew, etc.  A mature chick-lit novel for the 30+ crowd.	2004-08-09

Is God mental illness?) that I found very appealing.  Book seems to assert that what our society labels mental illness is what past societies would have labeled mysticism or sainthood.  A nice light summer read that still makes you think.	2004-08-06

I would not ordinarily be interested in a horse novel, but RIDING LESSONS is a terrific read. The writing is very accessible and honest---the heroine is a flawed and neurotic, but likeable. You can't help rooting for her even when her irrational behavior drives you nuts. Also an interesting look inside the world of horses rescued from abusive situations. I'll definitely want to read Sara Gruen's next book.	2004-07-26

This true-crime book is excellent and highly compelling.  A real page-turner that is essential reading for any aspiring writer.

Even if you don't like Stephen King's novels, any serious fiction writer should read this book.  It is hands-down the most informative, entertaining, and honest book about the writing process.  You'll learn a lot of useful information about hwo to be a self-directed, self-disciplined writer, as well as read some absolutely fantastic (and often hilarious) anecdotes about King's writing life, from childhood to the present day.

It's funny, and the author has a strong voice and wicked (and sometimes rather gross) sense of humor.  It's a fun read and a nice dark look into self-indulgent London society,  However, I think it needs an editor---there are some plot holes and inconsistencies that are a bit jarring in places.

This is a gorgeously written book, and I've been reading Marian Zimmer Bradley's work for years.  It's not quite up to snuff with her masterpiece THE MISTS OF AVALON (for which it is a prequel) but it is still a gorgeously written, feminist examination of the conflict between Druidic and Roman cultures in early Britain.  I recommend reading it after you read THE MISTS OF AVALON, because you'll get more out of this book and also color what you learned in MISTS in sharper focus.<br />I also recommend reading one of Zimmer Bradley's early novels, THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, which was recently put back into print by Baen Books.  THE FOREST HOUSE alludes to Atlantean culture as an ancient source for Druidism, and if you've read THE FALL OF ATLANTIS, you'll pick up on some of that.  It's cool to see how Zimmer Bradley's books fit together, even if they were written thirty years apart.	2004-06-01

Books	3	2	3	N	N	Cute and fun, but formulaic	I've liked Sophie Kinsella's books as light-hearted &quot;beach reading&quot; for several years, and this one was fun, but she seems stuck in the same formulaic plot rut as she did in the Shopaholic books.  Emma Corrigan is just Becky Bloomwood in a different body, with an obsession for secrets instead of shopping.  This book had a few fun moments, but for the most part it was predictable and more of the same.  I hope Kinsella finds a new plot structure for her next book, otherwise I might move on to more sophisticated things.	2004-06-01
