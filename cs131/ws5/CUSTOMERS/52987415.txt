His words still inspire a few folks to chuck their lives of quiet desperation and head for the hills to get away from it all.  Some are successful, some are not.  Many stay there only a year or two before the most pressing need -- the financial one -- forces them to return to civilization.<br /><br />That's not the case with Thomas Rain Crowe, who spent four years (1978-1982) living alone in a cabin in the Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina.  Crowe went back to his home state after living in a variety of places, doing a variety of work, communing with a variety of people.  When given the opportunity to be the cabin tenant, he made the most of it.  He worked hard to be self-sufficient, growing his own food and tending to his home and his tools.  Others might have been bored in such a setting, but not him.  He was always busy: gardening, fishing, taking care of his beehives, making homebrew, digging his root cellar, taking notes on the experience.  And he regained the use of one his most valuable resources, the Southern Mountain speech of his childhood.  He was downright satisfied with the situation.<br /><br />His mentors in this effort were several local men who offered advice from time to time:  Zoro Guice appeared in Yoda-like fashion whenever Crowe needed to learn how to perform a certain task.  Walt Johnson was the scamp of the neighborhood, but was also an accomplished dowser who could find water every time.  From these and other natives Crowe learned how to live close to the land, to live in the time of the seasons.  The reader senses that Crowe would be living there still, if civilization hadn't encroached upon the property and changed it forever.  That's when he knew he had to leave.<br /><br />Not just a doer, Crowe is also a viewer -- a writer, a poet, a spiritual man who feels a strong connection to the natural world.  His poetry uses simple words and turns of phrase to evoke powerful images.  On the other hand, his prose, the narrative of his story, is the work of a learned and literate man.  Complex constructs entice the reader to keep on going, to chew on the concepts and experiences offered.  It takes time to digest these lines, and it's time well spent.  Having witnessed Thomas Rain Crowe read some of this book aloud in person, I have the benefit of having heard the hint of the Smokies in his voice, the love for the place evident in every well-spoken syllable.  No matter; it comes through in the typewritten text as well.<br /><br />So was Thomas Wolfe right or wrong?  Can you or can't you go home again?  The reader decides.  In the meantime, \\"Zoro's Field\\" should be placed on a shelf with the works of the old and new naturalists (Thoreau, Burroughs, Leopold, Carson, Eiseley, Bass) to one side, and the \\"Foxfire\\" books to the other.

US	52987415	RY6H6VIHRBERP	0152053042	383864092	Leaf Man	Books	5	53	53	N	N	What fun!  So much to see!	This book is getting good reviews for good reason.  Lois Ehlert uses images of actual autumn leaves to tell a simple story.  And yet, it's not that simple.  In each colorful double-page spread, the leaves are arranged in order to form figures:  a man, barnyard animals, farm crops, etc., whatever supports the text.  As we advance through the story, we realize something different about the book.  The top edges of the pages aren't cut straight; they swoop to become horizon lines that change with each page turn, simulating the colorful rolling hills of autumn.  What a wonderful surprise!  Who would have thought of that technique?  It's perfect for the story.  The leaves are close at hand, and yet your eye catches the distant landscape, just as it might in real life.<br /><br />What I like most about this book is that it is educational in a subtle way.  It doesn't scream, \\"Here are leaf projects for you to try!\\"  It merely tells a story using leaves, and lets the readers become inspired to gather up and create leaf creatures of their own.  In other words, teaching and leading by example.  On the end-sheet of the front and back covers, sample leaves are each identified by tree name -- again, with subtlety.  If you want to know the names of the trees they came from, fine, there they are.  If you are too young (or too old!) to care, then the words do not intrude on your view of the leaves or the enjoyment of the book.  I can see that reading this book to a group of observant youngsters would take quite a while.  There's so much to see, and you might not catch it all the first time through.  \\"Leaf Man\\" requires multiple readings.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, educational picture book that will appeal to all ages.  It should be mandatory for nature center libraries and elementary school libraries.	2005-09-29

David Gessner employs the same technique here as he looks at the life of Cape Cod naturalist and writer John Hay.  Perhaps the general public is not as familiar with Hay's work as it is/was with Brower's, and that's a shame.  His is the third name linked to the nature writing about the Cape, after Henry David Thoreau and Henry Beston.  Founder of the Cape Cod Museum of Natural History, Hay started out as a poet apprentice to Conrad Aiken.  Gradually he found his own voice and began writing longer pieces, eloquently describing the habitat and birds and fishes of his adopted home.  When \\"The Run\\" came out in the 1950s, it was the first book to focus on the lives of herrings and on their place in the grand scheme of the natural cycle of seasons.<br /><br />Gessner becomes friends with Hay, and as he accompanies the elderly gentleman on walks, he learns much about the man and about the way the Cape used to be.  \\"The Prophet of Dry Hill\\" reads more like a few casual excursions and tame adventures than a traditional biography, and that suits the subject just fine.  Hay, then in his mid-80s, is slowing down, and both men believe that his time here is limited.  And like David Brower, Hay says what he thinks about the interconnectedness of all things and the blindness of politicians to see it.  It's the end of an era on the Cape, where little old cottages are being torn down to make way for million-dollar mansions.  In fact, by the end of the book, Hay and his wife have relocated to a more secluded place in Maine, and Gessner and his wife have moved to North Carolina.  Neither can afford -- in one way or another -- to stay on that beautiful sandy peninsula at the easternmost edge of the continent.<br /><br />This book is not the first to reminisce about the way the Cape used to be.  It surely won't be the last.  But it also serves as possibly a final walk along the shoreline with a man who cared deeply for the land and all of its creatures; a man who made a difference in conservation of Cape land; and a man who contributed deeply to our canon of American nature writing.  It also solidifies David Gessner's place in that genre as well.

Not only does she know every inch of the island, but she also knows everyone on it.  She's the perfect person to help solve the mystery of the chilling obituaries that newspaper editor Colley Jameson keeps receiving -- ones that feature himself as the deceased.  Chapter by chapter, author Riggs introduces us to a variety of characters whose paths must eventually cross and criss-cross again.  In soap opera fashion, everyone seems to have been married or involved with everybody else in the community.  (Writer Tom Dwyer should seem vaguely familiar to those who have read Philip R. Craig's books.)  When people start dying and Colley's fake obits come too close to reality, Victoria vows to get to the bottom of it all.  She is a feisty senior whose quirky approach to investigation is fun to follow to the end.  An entertaining read for cozy mystery afficionadoes.	2005-09-05

Thoreau had the town of Concord and the Concord River to inspire him.  Andrew Wyeth has Chadds Ford and the Brandywine River.  This large coffee table book places quotes from Thoreau against -- not Wyeth artwork -- but photographs of the Brandywine area taken by James A. Warner and Margaret J. White.  Some of the sites depicted also appear in Wyeth's work, and eight pieces of his own are actually reproduced here.  The photos are lovely and the quotes are nice enough.  Thoreau's words are printed in all caps, making them appear to shout from the page.  It's kind of an odd combination of text and images:  loud sentences and bucolic rural scenery.  This book may appeal to Wyeth fans or to natives of southeastern Pennsylvania.	2005-08-30

Though she has author delusions of grandeur, she knows in her heart that she can't compete with the likes of Rita Mae Brown, Lilian Jackson Braun, and her closest rival of all, Isabelle Hotchkiss.  But Felicity does have a small following, and her fans would be shocked to learn that (a) she's never been involved in solving a murder, and (b) she's never even owned a cat.  After a local book signing, Felicity returns to her home to find a dead man and a drugged cat in her vestibule.  Suddenly her fictional life becomes real, and she begins to put herself in her protagonist's shoes.  What would Prissy LaChatte do, and what crucial information would she glean from her cats, Morris and Tabitha?  Much to Felicity's dismay and exasperation, she learns that actual American murder investigations don't proceed like the fictional ones do.  Why isn't the handsome detective falling in love with her?  And real cats don't act like fictional ones, either.  Why do her new feline companions, Edith and Brigitte (both originally owned by the deceased), sleep most of the time?  And why does their cat food emit such a horrendous odor?  Most importantly:  How can Felicity solve this crime and get some free book publicity out of it?<br /><br />This is hands-down the funniest book I have read in a long time!  It pokes fun at cats, cat owners, mystery readers, mystery writers, writing groups, Bostonians, and Scottish-Americans.  It's great entertainment for any of the above.  Five tails up!	2005-08-27

Boston lawyer Brady Coyne needs to find her and reunite her with her ailing adopted father, Brady's Uncle Moze, before the worst happens.  His search covers ground from his ancestral home in southern Maine to towns west of Boston and south to Rhode Island.  Cassie's new husband and stepchildren are less than helpful and seem to know more than they're telling about her disappearance.  The task gets even trickier when Cassie's previous boyfriend is murdered mere minutes before he can talk to Brady.  Very few strands of a trail exist, and Brady diligently pursues each one of them.  If Cassie's not responsible for the most recent attacks, then who is?  At the same time, Brady is serving as a mediator to a couple planning divorce, and that causes him to debate the stability of his own two-year live-in relationship with Evie.  His own reunion with Uncle Moze forces him to think about the family matters that he usually ignores.<br /><br />With a storyline that's driven by dialogue, this is a fast read that can be finished in one or two sittings.  Now that we know more about Brady's past, some of us may want to &lt;sigh> read (or re-read) the 23 previous episodes in the series at our earliest convenience.	2005-08-27

Contemporary readers demand CONSISTENCY.  We want an author's future titles to be similar to her first one(s) so we know what to expect when we pick up a book with her name on it.  \\"Rococo\\" doesn't resemble the Big Stone Gap books.  So what?  Give the author a break!  Let her indulge in telling a story from a male character's point of view.  Let her write about the world of interior design.  We can't always read about the quirky folk in small-town Virginia.  The New Jersey coast will do just fine.<br /><br />2.  Contemporary readers want the main character to face IMMEDIATE CONFLICT.  Here our hero, Bartholomeo \\"B\\" di Crespi, doesn't come across his major professional conflict until page 59.  Too bad for those folks who allow an author only 50 pages to hook them.  The miscellaneous familial conflicts seem to be merely indicative of daily life in a large close-knit Italian-American family, but they turn out to be part of the major theme of the book.  Yes, the decorating challenge could have come on page one.  But how would we have known of B's expertise, inclinations and family background if that had been the case?<br /><br />3.  Contemporary readers prefer ACTION AND CONFLICT to SLICE OF LIFE DESCRIPTION.  Well gosh, real life isn't always chockful of high-paced action and stressful conflict.  We need birthday parties and family angst and trips to Europe to fill our days.  (Wishful thinking on that last item.)  Trigiani has provided us with descriptive imagery that is as rich as the rooms B has decorated.  But of course the narrative HAD to be that way because everything is seen through B's eyes, and he's been trained to notice every detail.<br /><br />Some readers will say gee, this book doesn't seem to be ABOUT anything, other than a guy who wants to renovate his hometown Catholic church.  Ah, but you've got to read on to discover the underlying theme, disclosed late in the book.  B -- a 40-year-old bachelor interior designer -- doesn't realize it, but he's the one who the rest of the family comes to for advice and solutions.  And when HE needs help -- much more substantial help than the kind he's usually asked to give -- his family and friends surprise him by coming through for him, big time.  This is real life, Italian style.<br /><br />I say, let your literary diet be as varied as your culinary one.  (Some of the recipes scattered throughout this book may help you on both accounts.)  Yes, \\"Rococo\\" is different in many ways.  Hallelujah for variety!  Though not everybody's cup of frosting, this is still a dandy read.

This second title in the Cottage Tales series is just as charming as the first, \\"The Tale of Hill Top Farm.\\"  Set in England's Lake District in the early 1900s, each episode centers on the pastoral lifestyle found in Near and Far Sawrey.  But even in a rural landscape, bad things can happen.  Children's author Beatrix Potter, now a farm owner and part-time Lake District resident, helps to solve the mysteries that confound the people of her new hometown.  She's aided by animals -- her own pets, the other domesticated animals of the community, and the wild ones who live nearby.  The result is the kind of book Potter herself might have written for adults, if she had had the time and inclination.<br /><br />After reading the first book, I realized I didn't know much about Beatrix and her children's books, so I read \\"Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller, and Countrywoman\\" by Judy Taylor.  (Another book that I highly recommend.)  Now I can see that Susan Wittig Albert is tackling and mastering three tasks at once:  weaving a ficticious mystery; setting it closely against biographical and historical fact; and sprinkling the story with the kind of animal insight and \\"dialogue\\" found in Potter's original tales.  The result is a wonderful and engaging narrative that is simply a joy a read.  Yes, it's \\"cozy,\\" but it's also more comfortable and familiar than others of that genre.<br /><br />Though she's been gone for more than 60 years, Beatrix Potter's spirit lives today:  not only in the reprints of her own work, but also in this new series by Albert.  How lucky for us!	2005-08-12

He's masculine, he's sexy without being overtly so, and he does great work as a carpenter.  This California boy somehow lands in the rural central U.S. plains and decides he likes the place. The plot follows a typical big-city-boy-settles-down-in-small-town-and-falls-in-love-with-hometown-girl format until the news gets out that an unnecessary interstate highway is planned to plow through Carlisle's new digs.  Suddenly a casual romance turns into an environmental mission in which the bad guys wear suits and drive vehicles with official logos on the doors.  Yes, Carlisle likes tango music and Susanna likes to do freeform naked gyrations on Wolf Butte, but it's the suits who take temporary center stage as they tapdance their way around ethical behavior.  Once that battle is over, Life resumes, albeit just a bit differently.<br /><br />Waller's descriptions are among the most vivid in literature today.  But the book is not without its difficulties.  The story unravels through several varying and overlapping viewpoints that might confuse the reader.  The identity of the occasional first-person reporter is never revealed, which was personally frustrating to me.  And though a heavy environmental message is thrust into the middle of the book, that segment winds up without a clear and satisfying conclusion.  Nevertheless:  decorated with a few Native American stories and mystical speculations, \\"High Plains Tango\\" is a decent read that can stand on its own merit.	2005-08-05

And that place turns out to be the home we should have been looking for all along.  That's what happened to NYC residents Wendy Bounds and Kathryn Kranhold in the aftermath of 9/11.  Their post-traumatic experiences eventually put them in Garrison, a small Hudson River settlement 50 miles north of Grand Central Station.  What makes Garrison most memorable is a combination store-and-bar called Guinan's (GUY-nenz).  Named after proprietor Jim Guinan, the building serves as a newspaper outlet for rail commuters, a refreshment stand for thirsty West Pointers, a monthly mecca of Irish ballads for local musicians, and the social center of the community.  How this family business got started and keeps on going is the real story, and it comes to light now because Wendy is a Wall Street Journal reporter.  Her journalistic instinct led her to take notes and record conversations; her heart led her to a real estate agent to make permanent her connection with the people and the area.  The CHEERS theme song got it right:  You want to be where everyone knows your name.  A warm, beautiful, compelling, and true example of sense of place.	2005-07-24

As with any new friends who have just met, the two begin to learn things about each other -- what they like to eat, and whether or not they like to be in water.  Once they've compared a few differences, it's time for fun.  Should they play hide-and-seek or find-and-eat?  How about pin-the-tail-on-the-turtle?  And just what is Fuzz hiding under the pointed leaf?  Before the book is over, they discover that they have at least one common interest.  That's all their friendship needs to keep it going.<br /><br />Lisa McCue's illustrations are wonderful and perfectly fit the playful mood of the storyline.  Her depictions are reminiscent of the classics done by Garth Williams, as two-dimensional animal fur looks soft enough to touch.  And author Dori Chaconas has thoughtfully chosen two main character critters that many people cannot tell apart.  Therein lies the teachable moment.<br /><br />Here's hoping for much success as this episode launches a new series.  Cork and Fuzz deserve to share many future adventures together!	2005-07-21

Well, that's what it *almost* does.  Yes, each double-page spread contains at least one crisp and lovely photo from the natural world.  And yes, the chapters follow the seasons and add relevant journal entries to the illustrations.  But the journal entries were written by Stephen J. Krasemann, not Thoreau.  42 quotes from Thoreau *do* appear throughout this 160-page volume, and those lines are set in larger print than Krasemann's journal entries.  The casual reader may scan through and think the journal entries are also Thoreau's, until he / she reaches the one that mentions automobiles.  Thoreau wrote about automobiles?  I don't think so.  That's when someone may think to look back at the verso of the title page to see the note \\"Larger type throughout book by Henry David Thoreau.\\"  The technique is a bit deceiving, but it goes along with the subtitle of the book, \\"Thoreau revisited.\\"  Readers should also be aware that the images and corresponding text refer to flora and fauna found in Wisconsin, the publication's origin.  That's why a thirteen-lined ground squirrel appears.  (He's not a native of Thoreau's New England.)  Nevertheless, this is one of the better Thoreau quote books from the 1970s, especially because of the all-color professional photographs.  A nice gift for a nature lover, and it's available inexpensively from book dealers and individual sellers.	2005-07-03

Bush looked at his wristwatch as a woman from the audience asked a question.  His subsequent attempt to answer her question failed, and those offered by his competitors (Ross Perot and Bill Clinton) were much more on target.  What should he have done differently?<br /><br />That's one of the real-life examples studied in \\"In the Line of Fire.\\" Author Jerry Weissman has years of experience coaching high-profile executives in presentation skills.  Invaluable too is his background as a television producer who worked with Mike Wallace, one of the toughest interviewers of all time.  When asked a crucial question in a public forum, a novice may panic and freeze.  Weissman shows how the speaker can control the question, the answer, the questioner, the audience, the time, and himself/herself -- and create and maintain a positive image in the process.<br /><br />Weissman provides techniques that will help someone defuse hostile inquiries without being defensive, evasive, or contentious.  When you get right down to it, most of these strategies seem obvious and logical.  Rely on absolute truth.  Honor the audience.  Listen effectively.  Paraphrase and restate the Roman Column (the key issue) of the question.  Identify and develop position statements for each red flag issue.  Achieve Topspin. Prepare and practice, practice and prepare.<br /><br />What makes this book additionally entertaining as well as educational is the use of real-life case studies from the realms of television, sports, and most of all, politics.  After all, \\"Politicians speak far more often than do mere mortals.\\" (p. 120)  Transcript excerpts and still photos from presidential debates (1960-2004) and official press conferences serve to show what to say and do, and what NOT to say and do.  Here we see the best and the worst of the figures we're all too familiar with:  Lloyd Bentsen, George H. Bush, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Trent Lott, Ross Perot, Colin Powell, Dan Quayle, Ronald Reagan, and Norman Schwarzkopf.  The narrative is an amusing but instructive walk down Memory Lane.  With such prime examples to refer to, we're more apt to remember their successes and failures.<br /><br />My sole criticism is that the case studies are exclusively MALE.  What, no Hillary Rodham Clinton?  No Geraldine Ferraro?  No Janet Reno?  No Condi Rice?  Maybe women don't make the same mistakes that men do.  &lt;grin><br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"In the Line of Fire\\" is an engaging read, aimed primarily at those folks who do presentations and then field Q&A sessions afterward. It is relevant to anyone in a position of authority who must deal with the public or with employees or colleagues.  It offers good advice for everybody, even those not running for the presidency of a country, a company, or a community group.  The examples are clear, easy to understand, and empowering.  This book is a good resource to chew on once, mull over, then revisit before walking out to the podium.  An accompanying DVD is planned for release.

The narrative is an amusing but instructive walk down Memory Lane.

It is relevant to anyone in a position of authority who must deal with the public or with employees or colleagues.  It offers good advice for everybody, even those not running for the presidency of a country, a company, or a community group.  The examples are clear, easy to understand, and empowering.

Well, you might come close by using the techniques and tips offered in this book.  \\"Qualitative Natural History\\" is a four-part process that involves an event, meanings, feelings, and felt-significance.  Thoreau's own method of inquiry followed those lines but was less formal.  Since long walks and independent exploration were part of Thoreau's regimen, author David Pepi focuses on those activities.  \\"Skills\\" chapters provide tips about the art of walking as well as choosing appropriate clothing, gear, books, and binoculars.  \\"Excursions\\" chapters describe habitats and circumstances where you will encounter flora and fauna.  Published in 1985, this book is outdated in many respects.  The encouragement to submerge oneself in a bog is especially disturbing.  Natural peat bogs are fragile and unique environments that are now often under state or federal protection, so walking on the spagnum moss mat or taking a brief dip in the muck is no longer a good idea and usually isn't possible.  But the basic tenet of venturing afield and seeing what's out there is still valid -- perhaps even more so today, when many folks are disconnected from the environment.  A marginal addition to either Thoreauvian or nature studies.	2005-06-24

Here he traces the course of Central Pennsylvania's Juniata River, which he has been fishing since he was 15 years old.  He highlights its fishing opportunities and gives historical background along the way.  Chapters follow McIlnay and his friends as they float down and fish sections of the river, then alternate with stories from the colonial and native history of Pennsylvania.  For a self-published book with a local focus, it's just OK.<br /><br />The \\"floating\\" chapters provide decent fishing and navigation tips.  The Juniata River covers 100 miles, from the confluence of the Raystown and Frankstown branches near Ardenheim, to its mouth at the Susquehanna River, just north of Duncannon.  Even though I have driven alongside the Juniata River hundreds of times, I couldn't envision all the places mentioned. I had to read this book with an extra Pennsylvania atlas open on my lap so that I could place some of the descriptions.  This travelogue and guidebook *desperately* needs current, detailed maps of the river sections.  The text is supplemented with b&w photos: 28 present-day photos and 10 historical images (including a few state historical maps).  Yet while the book's main focus is on fishing, it contains no photos of fish, nor of McIlnay's jonboat.  A close-up of the leafy \\"Lizard's Tail\\" plant is nice enough.  But what of the carp, bass, muskies and shad?<br /><br />While the history chapters *do* include interesting state maps, the accompanying text is not always applicable to the topic at hand, the Juniata River.  The stories tend to focus on Native American atrocities throughout Penn's colony in the 1600s and 1700s.  For example, the Walking Purchase was indeed a land swindle that the whites pulled on the natives.  But it covered territory near the Delaware River in eastern Pennsylvania, not along the Juniata.  Too much irrelevant historical background is presented here.  Omitted are the interesting local stories that surely must surround communities like Huntingdon, Mount Union, Lewistown, and McVeytown.  River towns such as these are sure to have their own share of \\"sorrows,\\" if that's a key focus, and those events didn't all happen before the Revolutionary War.  Reciting earlier history throughout the rest of the commonwealth (like the native settlements in Sunbury and Kittanning, both located outside the Juniata River watershed) reflects much research but is just too tangential.  It bogs down the narrative.<br /><br />Readers in search of great fishing reading would be better served by picking up a copy of William Tapply's \\"Gone Fishin',\\"  which is set in New England.  Those who want to know more about the local history of Central Pennsylvania may have to stick to the newspaper columns that occasionally run in the Altoona Mirror, the Centre Daily Times, the Harrisburg Patriot, and the Lewistown Sentinel.ted here.

They traveled by rail to the Mississippi River, then sailed up to St. Paul and spent a month in that area.  Their return trip used Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, then returned to the railroads to pass through Canada and New England.  They covered more than 2000 miles from May to July 1861.  And they did it amid sickness and during the uncertain time of the early days of the Civil War.<br /><br />Yet this adventure is not well known, probably because neither man had a chance to publish a book or even an essay about it.  Thoreau took notes along the way; but he was in poor health and his notes are brief, probably meant only to jog his memory until he could write more when he got home.  Horace Mann, Jr., wrote letters to his mother, describing some of their activities.  Those two primary sources form the basis of what we know about the excursion.<br /><br />Thoreau expert Walter Harding took both of those resources and printed them in this slim volume.  He made an attempt to briefly explain or correct some of Thoreau's abbreviations or Mann's references, and his interpretations are set off in brackets throughout the text.  While this effort indeed offered more information than we previously had available, it was far from a definitive narrative of the trip.  The few researchers who have subsequently written about \\"The Journey West\\" have used Harding's work as a foundation or jumping-off point.  In that respect, this book is invaluable.  But some of Harding's assumptions are simply incorrect.  And when you find one mistake, you have to wonder about all the remaining observations.<br /><br />If you have just a casual interest in this little-publicized event in Thoreau's life, then this title is an interesting one to skim through.  Copies are often available in academic libraries.  If you want to know The Truth about the trip, you'll have to dig much deeper.cademic libraries.

Though his original intent was to go there to write, he did some nature observation and terrain exploration as well.  He chose to make his retreat during the winter of 2000-2001, beginning just after election day.  We who were stuck back here in civilization can only envy his self-made cocoon of quiet, blissfully removed from the incessant media analysis of the Bush-Gore-Florida quandry.  We can merely shake our heads, remembering.<br /><br />Memory comes into play quite a bit here.  After taking care of his immediate needs and taking in the natural world around him, Daniel spends much of his alone time considering the past.  Or two pasts, really: his father's and his own.  Something he sees or thinks about at the cabin will remind him of something else from the past, and he follows that tangent. He writes about his father and traces the man's work in the American labor movement as well as his struggle with alcoholism.  At the same time, he reveals much about his own life and about growing up in a 1960s culture that was both anti-Vietnam and pro-drugs.  \\"Rogue River Journal\\" is as much about Daniel's voyage of self-discovery as it is a temporary escape from society.  By the end of his sojourn, it seems as if he has come to terms with all of it: his relationship with his father, his own varied and sometimes illegal activities of his younger days, his writing career, even the choice to enforce this self-imposed confinement.  Daniel gets *very* personal, yet this is not a pure autobiography.  It's funny, it's sad, it's thought-provoking, it's Life.<br /><br />Daniel writes, \\"I thought I might find two books here -- one about the experience of solitude, the other the story of my coming of age and my father.  From the start though, the two wanted to loop and weave together, and I saw no reason, and see none now, to discourage their union.\\" (p. 301)  The result honors both men.  Obviously Franz Daniel passed the story-telling gene onto his son John.  He has a knack for offering vivid descriptions and the tales to go with them, knowing just when to bring one segment to a temporary close so that we'll want to turn the page to discover what happened next.  Baby Boomer readers will have no problem reminiscing on their own, inspired by Daniel's candid ruminations.  This book is more contemplative than most \\"Walden\\" wannabees.<br /><br />John Daniel uncovers two truths for us:  We need occasional solitude in order to understand who we are as individuals.  And we also need distance from the past in order to comprehend its contribution to our personalities and lives.

Perhaps you instead have the two-volume reprint done by Dover in the early 1960s.  You might even be collecting the books in the Princeton University series that is gradually re-issuing Thoreau's journal in a fully-indexed, more accurate form.  In any case, you might assume that you have the whole text of his journal.  Wrong!  Look closely at the dates.  What's missing is Henry?s original volume 3, covering the time span between July 30, 1840, and January 22, 1841.  He was 23 years old then and hadn't yet gone to the cabin at Walden Pond.  His life was only half over, and many more writing days lay ahead of him.<br /><br />Perry Miller \\"discovered\\" this misplaced volume and made it available to the rest of us.  Thoreau's observations actually take up fewer than 100 pages of \\"Consciousness in Concord.\\"  The first half of the book is Miller's commentary about Thoreau, his writing, the times, etc.  His analyses are interesting, and he poses some theories not available from other experts.  He maintains that Thoreau *always* intended for the journal to be published.  He also thinks that Transcendentalists in general (and Thoreau specifically) were obsessed with death.  He supports his arguments with his own brand of logic, leaving it up to the reader to agree or disagree.<br /><br />Amidst Thoreau's \\"lost\\" words are some gems of wisdom that we missed out on before, as of course there must be:<br /><br />\\"The true laborer is recompensed by his labor not by his employer.\\"<br /><br />\\"When we rise to the step above, we tread hardest on the step below.\\"<br /><br />\\"Floating in still water, I too am a planet, and have my orbit,  in space, and am no longer a satellite of the earth.\\"<br /><br />\\"When one hears a strain of music he feels his blood flow in his veins.\\"<br /><br />\\"Consciousness in Concord\\" is a classic and indispensable work for Thoreau fans who want to have *everything* -- even those who disagree with Miller.  It is often used as a source in other books of literary criticism.

In \\"Harp on the Shore,\\" Willard Bonner branched off and analyzed just the sea-faring references in Thoreau's works.  At first glance, the reader may think this to be a rather narrow field of research.  But you can find an amazing number of these references in his journals and published works when you take the time to look and to understand the language of his day.  Though he'd never sailed much himself, Thoreau was not above using the folklore of the sea that was/is so prevalent in New England.  And isn't Life the biggest voyage of all?  An interesting focus, recommended just for those who seek further depth in their Transcendental reading.	2005-06-03

It's almost difficult to believe that Tharp and Marshall used some of the same personal letters as source material.  For this new offering is the masterpiece, a Rolls Royce to Tharp's tricycle.  No wonder it took decades to assemble and complete.<br /><br />Though the sisters had three younger brothers, the accomplishments of the men pale in comparison with those of the women.  Elizabeth (1804-1887) was a teacher, writer, publisher, and encouraging friend (and never more than that) to many of the Transcendentalists and their crew. Mary (1806-1887) was the beautiful one, another teacher, who set her sights early on snagging Horace Mann as a spouse (and eventually succeeded).  Sophia (1809-1871) was the invalid artist who found her creative dream partner in husband Nathaniel Hawthorne. All were inspired by the example set by their mother, Elizabeth Palmer Peabody (1778-1853), whose liberal and feminist ideals are in retrospect more suggestive of the late 20th century, and not of her own time.  The Peabodys were not among the financially elite Bay-Staters, but they seemed to have their fingers on the pulse of the commonwealth and on the trends of the country.<br /><br />Framed at beginning and end by Sophia and Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1842 wedding, this volume is one of the most detailed narrative chronicles of familial correspondence you're apt to read in your lifetime.  It's never tedious, simply all-encompassing.  The very words of the individuals themselves are so revealing, so personal.  We can tap into their emotions of the moment: their joys, sorrows, angers, jealousies, misunderstandings, and hopes.  After just a few chapters, the reader comes to KNOW these women and their fellow correspondents.  The text is supplemented with b&w portraits of every major character in this real-life drama, giving us a chance to truly SEE them.  Those were the days when people wrote and sent letters, then read the answers aloud to drawing-room audiences of friends and relatives.  A different time indeed.<br /><br />Though I and other reviewers elsewhere have given this book a high rating, it won't be for everyone.  It's highly recommended for students (both casual and formal) of American history, American literature, and women's studies.

Lydia Jackson heard him speak in her hometown of Plymouth, and she felt honored and almost unworthy when the great man afterward engaged her in personal conversation.  Any number of women would gladly have exchanged places with her.  But it was *she* whom Emerson sought out and *she* to whom he proposed marriage. (And *she* of whom he also demanded a name change and a move to Concord, but that's beside the point...)<br /><br />Theirs was to be an intellectual match of equals and a real partnership, which was an unusual and ambitious undertaking for the time.  But after the arrival of their first child, Waldo and Lidian fell into the traditional roles that marriages generally adhere to.  For Lidian, the experience resulted in feelings of abandonment and unappreciation.  She was often the last to know Waldo's travel plans for lecture tours.  She became jealous of every female guest who spent time in parlor discussions with her husband -- with or without good reason -- especially Margaret Fuller.  This was *not* the fulfilling life she had imagined.<br /><br />And so, wanting more, she turned to a close family friend for conversation, caring, and concern - Henry David Thoreau.  History has shown that the two were friends.  In this novel, they become a bit more intimate, with Lidian being the instigator.  In the 21st century, we're not surprised by this kind of turn of events, for we read similar headlines about celebrity marriages and third-party affairs on the front covers of grocery store rags.  Those of us who are Thoreau fans would like to think that he would have been above that kind of behavior.  And Lidian too, for that matter.  They were *Transcendentalists*, for heavens sakes!<br /><br />I was prepared to hate this book because I knew I disagreed with the Lidian-Henry relationship it describes.  But I can't hate the book.  It is a work of fiction, after all.  I think it's otherwise a fair and valid portrayal of Lidian's life as Mr. Emerson's wife.  Too frequently we hear about Ralph Waldo Emerson, and his second wife fades into the background, if she's mentioned at all.  Reading this novel will provide a little more perspective into the daily life of the most influential man in 19th-century Concord.  The moral of the story is: be careful what you wish for.ok.

But that's after we have spent a great deal of time in the woods with this likeable and contemporary disciple of Edward Abbey and Aldo Leopold, listening intently and eagerly grabbing every observation he tosses in our direction.<br /><br />In standard natural history narrative style, Petersen shares a sample year with us.  He and his wife Caroline live as simply as possible in a mountain cabin near the city of Durango, Colorado.  They raise or find their own food, with Dave the hunter providing meat from a single elk each year.  While this lifestyle has immeasurable benefits -- like witnessing a screen-door nose-touch between a bear cub on the porch and the family dog standing inside -- it is not without its pitfalls.  Ranking high on that list are the lack of medical insurance and the near-constant verification of the stupidity of mankind.  It's not as easy to \\"simplify\\" today as it was in Thoreau's time.<br /><br />Page after page, Petersen teaches us much about the natural world of the Rockies. As far as plants, insects and stars are concerned -- well, their numbers are so many that he admits he doesn't know much about the individuals among them.  Give him mammals -- the bigger, the better -- and he can rattle off every one of their habits and preferences.  Deer, elk, and bears are among his favorite fellow creatures.  And though he hunts, he's conscientious when it comes to aiming his arrow.  His behavior and choices mirror that of any other wild predator.<br /><br />Reading and thinking about this lifestyle provides great environmental joy, but it's also a double-edged sword.  This is the kind of book we read and say, \\"YES! That's the life I've always wanted to lead.\\"  But if we all lived it, it would no longer be unique, and the wilderness -- the very thing we'd want to get close to -- would be destroyed in the process.  The intelligent tactic for us, then, is to let folks like Dave and Caroline Petersen be the forest dwellers.

The younger woman realizes how little she really knows about Sylvia as she goes through her possessions.  Too soon she finds out that some of the other town residents don't hold Sylvia in as high esteem as she does.  Someone obviously hated the woman and now has transferred that hate to Torie, for an as-yet-unknown reason. She's physically attacked, and items are stolen from the Gaheimer House.  And just about everyone is beginning to treat Torie differently.<br /><br />Torie believes the underlying secret has something to do with photos of a little girl she's found among Sylvia's things.

Avid readers of this series will remember that Sam pursued Julia at every turn, and she was too close to see his attention for what it was.  She's still not sure about his intentions, even though they're now married -- or are they? Seems the minister they ran to in Tennessee wasn't ordained by a legal church. Ooops!  So Julia and Sam are in trouble, as are a few dozen other couples and a famous country singer whose wedding-gone-awry story appears in a supermarket tabloid.<br /><br />That's only the minor storyline here.  The big news is that Hazel Marie is planning a local beauty contest, and to that end she enlists the help of Miss Julia and her nemesis, Etta Mae Wiggins. The six contestants must be taught how to walk, talk, dress, and make themselves appealing to the audience and the three judges.  Hazel Marie and Etta Mae do most of the work with the girls, so no formal School of Beauty exists. But to Miss Julia's credit, she takes the most needy contestant under her wing and does pretty well with her.  And the pageant is a success.<br /><br />Other readers may think this episode is somehow lacking, but I laughed out loud more than once at Miss Julia's observations and succinct assessments. Her constant appraisal of everything that comes her way is one of her endearing qualities. She *does* need to calm down where Sam is concerned and simply trust that he is indeed a good man who is hopelessly devoted to her.

And it's a long struggle in the remote wilds of Rocky Mountain National Park.<br /><br />I was captivated by the turn of events and the characters and read the last half of the book with both curiosity and dread.  I like to be mystified, but I don't like to be scared. I don't watch horror movies and I don't usually read dark and sinister stuff.  That being said, I think HARD TRUTH may be the last Anna Pigeon book for me.  I've read each book in the series and have enjoyed them overall, especially as they are set in such wonderful surroundings. But the darkness and the violence is getting too much for naive, little me.  I wish Ms. Barr and Anna well, and maybe our paths will cross again someday.<br /><br />HARD TRUTH is an intriguing, suspenseful, well-crafted story that could all too easily be true.

Gilbert (1870-1942) was probably the first African-American landscape photographer. Author John Hanson Mitchell sets out to prove this fact after finding thousands of glass plates initially attributed to William Brewster (1851-1919) , the first president of the Massachusetts Audubon Society.  For it turns out that Brewster had a \\"factotum\\" -- Mr. Gilbert, an employee who accompanied him on photographic excursions throughout New England, and who actually took the photos and developed the images. The search for Mr. Gilbert begins.<br /><br />Several interlocking histories emerge:  Mr. Gilbert's life, William Brewster's life, the origins of the Audubon Society, the aristocratic circles of the Boston Brahmins, and the lifestyles of the Southern blacks who migrated north after the Civil War.  Each chapter opens with one of Gilbert's b&w photos, giving us just a taste of his work.  What a teaser!  We want to see them ALL!  Hopefully, MassAudubon will someday hold a showing of more of these wonderful bucolic scenes from the beginning of the last century.<br /><br />Another underlying story here is the relationship of the researcher with his subject.  Mitchell is the kind of investigator who knows that the answers he wants cannot be provided by the Internet or through interlibrary loan.  Sometimes you just have GO and ASK. He may be a soft-spoken observer, but he has no qualms about going anywhere, doing anything, and talking to anybody who may be able to provide clues in his quest for the truth.  His own re-creations of Mr. Gilbert's life take him from the valleys of western Virginia to the mountains of southern New Hampshire, from the streets of Boston to Paris. He watches, he listens, he analyzes.  And he gets lucky in meeting a few folks who either knew Mr. Gilbert or at least knew someone who did.<br /><br />This book provides a great escape into another life in another time.  It's also noteworthy in its focus on an average African-American man who wasn't famous in his day, but did good work and should be given credit for it.'t famous in his day, but did good work and should be given credit for it.	2005-02-28

The organization celebrated its 50th Jubilee anniversary with a two-week-long extravaganza in 1991, and many of the presentations appear in this collection.  Represented is a wide spectrum of topics: from literary to biographical, geographical, ecological, scientific, and the eclectic.  Each of the seven sections begins with a few Thoreau quotes for inspiration.  The preface contains Walter Harding's resignation after decades of serving as secretary and newsletter editor of the Society.  Also included is Laura Dassow Walls' essay \\"Seeing New Worlds: Thoreau and Humboldtian Science,\\" a paper which preceeded the book that she published in 1995.  The Jubilee was a landmark event, and this is a solid volume of voices.  Thoreau researchers of any ilk are bound to find something useful and  / or entertaining in this book.<br /><br />CONTENTS:<br /><br />Recollections of the Early Days of The Thoreau Society ~ Walter Harding<br /><br />Henry David Thoreau and the 21st Century ~ Robert C.

Jackson and Brady Coyne usually have their own escapades and their own mysteries to solve.  But the men are friends and live only a few hours apart from each other, so it seems inevitable that on occasion their paths will cross.  Authors Craig and Tapply have led them to do so in \\"Second Sight.\\"  Brady is helping a family friend find his missing daughter.  J. W. has agreed to provide security for a high-profile visitor to Martha's Vineyard.  The characters take turns narrating chapters, so readers eavesdrop on both men's prospectives.  Both Massachusetts natives seem to find themselves in situations that they think are just a bit beyond their investigative capabilities.  Other than that -- and their mutual love of fishing -- the two have unique approaches and personalities.  It is their individualities and the dichotomies of their situations that make this combination novel intriguing and worth reading.<br /><br />J.W. is an ex-cop-turned-fisherman who lives to be on the beach.  Brady is a hard-working lawyer up in Boston.  J.W. is now an established family man, caring for wife Zee and kids Joshua and Diana. Brady's in a relationship that he's currently questioning.  J.W. knows nearly every nook and cranny of Martha's Vineyard and has the contacts to follow up on leads.  Brady is more familiar with the Boston metropolitan area and is less certain of the terrain he must cover for this assignment.  And while J.W. is defending a famous celebrity who's known by millions by sight, Brady is searching for an average teenage runaway who hasn't left much of a trail. Two-thirds of the way through the book, the men realize that the fates of both of their charges hinge on what will happen at the Celebration of Humanity peace concert, which could be anything BUT peaceful.  Once the two plots converge, it's all the reader can do to hang on and hope that the good guys will be able to prevent an unspeakable horror of 9-11 magnitude.  The ultimate irony is that the action takes place on Martha's Vineyard, a prime vacation island and second home to some of The Rich and Famous. In \\"Second Sight,\\" it's a hazardous and tragic place to find oneself.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful installment for readers of either mystery series.  And if you \\"know\\" only J.W.

Publishers have responded in kind by releasing many biographical series targeted at the teenage audience.  Though the quality of such books varies, the volumes always meet the teachers' 100-page minimum and offer at least a modicum of academic credibility.<br /><br />Here's one of the better samplings covering the life of Henry David Thoreau.  Miller begins by focusing on the Walden Pond experience, and then retreats to cover the usual background information.  He's already snagged his readers and waits until page 20 to broach the concept of Transcendentalism, which is probably a good tactic.  No sense in bringing it up earlier and running the risk of having the young readers stop turning pages because they don't understand the vocabulary.  While this book is obviously not an in-depth literary or biographical analysis, the author doesn't dumb down the information and doesn't approach it in an overtly scholarly fashion.  Facts and stories are told in an interesting and personal way, using a conversational style and often adding Thoreau's own words to illustrate his observations and philosophies.<br /><br />Some devoted academics might scoff at Miller's interpretation of one of Thoreau's most-dissected statements: that of losing \\"a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove.\\"  The contemporary take is that the tale is merely about life's losses.  Here, Miller says the trio \\"represents the spiritual reality behind nature.\\"  What?  Hmmm.  That excerpt aside, the author is obviously a Thoreau fan and did not merely churn this book out to meet a publisher's criteria.  His concluding statement is \\"If our planet is to survive to celebrate the bicentennial of his death in the year 2062, the world would do well to heed his vision.\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />A sole criticism of this work is that Thoreau's statements are used without footnotes.  While this technique makes for easier adolescent reading, it can be vexing to anyone wanting to locate the original source of those quotes.  A three-page narrative bibliography is quite useful, as is the full index.  School and public librarians would do well to make this title available to their patrons.  It serves a population that's not quite ready for the standard full-bodied HDT biographies by Canby, Harding or Richardson.thout footnotes.

It's winter, and the book opens during a Thanksgiving snowstorm.  This time the Piedmont community has to deal with several murders related to what appears to be a sacred miracle: tears of blood streaming from the eyes of a Virgin Mary statue at a nearby Blue Ridge mountain monastery.  In addition to unraveling the story behind the story, Harry and the gang do some individual soul-searching about their religious beliefs and also over personal issues like mid-life crises and sexual orientation.  Harry herself is at both a personal and a professional crossroad: she's out of a job at the post office, and her ex-husband has proposed to her again.  What to do, what to do?  Don't worry: by the last page, her future becomes clearer.<br /><br />In the meantime, the Crozet pets talk to each other, as has become their habit.  They continue to muse about the failings of humans: from their propensity to sit for hours looking at a computer screen, to the wars they wage upon each other.  Some of the most insightful conversations in the book take place among the cats and dogs.  After all, they are the REAL investigators in each mystery.  One has to wonder why they don't mind traipsing through the snow after their masters, especially the cats.  Most felines I've known would rather watch the snowflakes from a warm windowsill than set one furry paw in a snowbank.  Mrs. Murphy and Pewter must be the exceptions.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is an interesting episode in the Mrs. Murphy series.  Best read during a snowstorm of your own, with a cup of hot tea and a steaming buttered scone at the ready, and (of course!) a cat curled up on your lap.	2005-01-30

Some images are reproductions of Thoreau's own drawings; others are historical sources that he might/must have consulted.  Any originals here are more accurate than the master map in John Christie's \\"Thoreau as World Traveler,\\" though a few minor lines are not quite exact.  Each map is accompanied by explanatory text about the trip and Thoreau's methods of transportation.  In some places, the photos or maps are a page-turn away from the text that explains them, making the reader scan back and forth.  But for the most part, this book is an invaluable volume for contemporary Thoreau disciples and researchers to own.  It provides the when, where, and how of Thoreau's excursions, and it supplements the details with period photos of places and transport.  A chronology of his travels and a full index complete this useful work.  Used copies are surprisingly easy to find, too.	2005-01-27

What a good decision!  I love reading mysteries, and this one meets every criteria I can think of to make a good, entertaining, and suspenseful read.  Other reviewers have spoken about the plot, so I need not address it.  Suffice it to say that Judge Deborah Knott is an independent woman of a sensible age who is intrigued by crime and murder even when she's not on her home turf.  All of the characters here are believable and likable -- at least, at first -- and they talk like people do in real life.  Maron's descriptions paint such complete scenes that I could picture the town of Cedar Gap fully: the streets, the businesses, the big MacMansions built by the Florida seasonals.  I spent such an enjoyable time in Cedar Gap that I must go back and read the other nine Deborah Knott novels, in order.  Perhaps by the time I'm caught up, another one will be waiting on the shelf...	2005-01-13

What we -- and numerous beachside homeowners -- have forgotten is that a coastline is a dynamic natural environment.  The wind and the waves are constantly reshaping the shore: taking grains of sand from one place and relocating them in another.  When a house gets in the way, well, guess what happens? The Southeast Asian tsunamis of December 2004 were a catastrophic version of the give-and-take played out on every beach on earth, every minute of every day.<br /><br />Dealing with shoreline erosion is not a new concept to the residents of the Cape Cod town of Chatham, Mass., and its Nauset Beach area.  \\"The process makes Nauset Beach one of the most powerful sand transport systems on the planet.  The south end of Nauset Beach grows 200 to 300 feet a year, or about a mile every ten years.  We can see the process from space.  If we discovered something like this happening on another planet, it would receive worldwide attention.\\" (p. 20-21)  William Sargent describes how living in this kind of habitat affects Chatham residents after a northeaster in January 1987 dramatically changes the landscape.  He stays with the story through 1994, then revisits the area ten years later.  As with any complex environmental problem, politics ultimately gets involved.  No one has a definitive answer.  While scientists can supply good research based on past experience, residents and politicians ultimately must come up with remedies or methods of coping with the destruction. \\"The amount of erosion occurring on the coasts is no different today than it was a hundred years ago and is probably no different than it will be during the next hundred years.  The only difference is that there are many more people living on the coasts today than there were a century ago.\\" (p. 143)<br /><br />While the author's approach to his subject is fine, his (or his editor's) command of proper grammar gets in the way of the message.  A dozen times in the text, the word \\"it's\\" is used as a possessive pronoun instead of \\"its.\\"  On page 18, this mistake happens three times in one paragraph!

In school, we learned to say \\"Robert Fulton\\" whenever we were asked to name the inventor of the steamship.  Alas, not only is that answer wrong; but a correct one cannot be summed up by just one name, one year, or one event.  Andrea Sutcliffe unravels the tangled web of men, machines, failures, successes, financial backers, patents and politics involved in getting steamships chugging on American rivers during the time period of 1784 to 1811.  Here we learn about people like John Fitch and James Rumsey.  We discover how George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were involved in the process.  We read about boiler explosions, innumerable tinkerings and improvements, and proving \\"who had what idea when.\\"  The newly-formed Patent Office plays a huge role in this drama.  Robert Fulton doesn't even make an appearance until the last third of the book.  Throughout it all, one has to wonder about the tenacity and sanity of the men who not only had to deal with the temperament of machines, but also with the skepticism of state and federal authorities.  Imagine attempting to take a prototype steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers during the New Madrid earthquake of 1811!  Why didn't we ever hear about these stories in school?  As for Robert Fulton:  \\"As Fulton freely admitted, he never really invented the steamboat.  Rather, he built the first steamboat that really worked.\\"  (p. 180)  And he comes off as a dandy and an opportunist in this book.<br /><br />You might scoff and ask, \\"How interesting can the history of the steamboat be?\\"  Read this book and find out.

Bly approaches Thoreau's writings in five ways, then adds examples of poetry, journal entries, and book excerpts to illustrate his analysis.

Editor Carl Bode can tell you why:  \\"There are, on analysis, three major reasons why most persons have ignored Thoreau's poetry.  The first in importance, perhaps, is its uneven quality. The second, and related, reason is the fact that he himself lost enthusiasm for the poetic medium; the quantity of his production quickly dwindled.  The third is the mistaken belief that the verses are mere fragments woven into the prose ... and inseparable from it.\\" (p. vii-viii)  Then Dr. Bode assembled all the known HDT poems into this book.  Some are just two lines long; others span several pages.  Most do not follow conventional poetic form, other than the one imagined by the writer.  While Nature is the topic of many poems, Friendship and Love show up occasionally as well.  Alas, these poems are not quite as \\"quotable\\" as Thoreau's prose is.  Bode includes explanatory appendices for the scholars and a useful index of titles and first lines for the rest of us.<br /><br />This publication was originally released in 1943.  An enlarged edition containing 12 additional poems was published in 1965.  A copy of either book will give you access to more Thoreau poetry than is traditionally available in popular literature.	2005-01-05

He did manage to journey a bit throughout Massachusetts and New England.  He once lectured in Philadelphia and even lived for a time on Staten Island.  He made a Canadian excursion to Montreal and the St. Lawrence River, and he visited Maine three times. His longest trip occurred in 1861, when he took two months to travel to Minnesota and back via train and steamship, in the hopes of curing his consumption.  But compared to the other Transcendentalists, Henry was generally a stay-at-home man.<br /><br />While sitting in Concord, he could travel a good deal through books. The travel narrative was a thriving genre for 19th-century readers.  Thoreau not only pored through such volumes, he even wrote one or two of his own. He was first enamored by the travel writings of Goethe, Alexander Henry, and Charles Darwin.  Those men set the stage for the narratives Thoreau would read later in life -- books that would take him to every corner of the earth without having to leave his beloved Concord.<br /><br />The intent of \\"Thoreau as World Traveler\\" is to chronicle both methods of travel for Thoreau: the real and the vicarious.  Map the paths of his actual journeys, then turn to those made by the authors he traveled with on the printed page.  This worthy endeavor required a lot of research for author Christie, as he duplicated Thoreau's reading habits.  While he begins with details of the real excursions, the meat of this work comes in<br /><br />the second half of the book.  There he dissects Thoreau's readings and shows how the 19th-century naturalist's writings and philosophies reflected those of the authors and places he was reading about at the time.

Books	4	4	4	N	Y	Simple, logical advice to overcome a popular problem	Succinct motivational business books have blossomed ever since the success of \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\"  This one addresses a topic we're all familiar with and may need to be reminded of every so often:  accountability.  While the problem and its remedies aren't new, they're presented in a fresh package here.<br /><br />As has become the standard preamble for this genre, this book begins with a parable.  A worker who has encountered a problem wants desperately to find a solution.  But everyone he asks has an answer involving THEY.  THEY make the rules.  THEY need to do something.  The worker tries to track down this elusive THEY, moving through the administrative levels of the business and to the board, the labor union, the finance department, and human resources.  He finally comes to a realization while talking with other workers in the company bathroom and looking in the mirror.  What if we use the words ME and WE instead of THEY?  Doesn't that simple approach change everything?<br /><br />The second half of the book addresses the process of putting the ME / WE concept into practice.  Quizzes measure levels of accountability and personal responsibility.  Quotes from successful people inspire us.  A standard method is introduced for approaching problems, assessing needs, and setting goals.  An added emphasis is that if you want to make change, you must realize that you can change only yourself.  Then you can hope that your own behavior influences others.  The chronically-negative folks and professional victims should be left alone to either stew in their own juices or to join the crowd when the mood strikes them.  The goal here is to move from Whiner to Winner and from Victim to Victor.  The book makes the transition seem fairly easy.  Using it in real-life situations will be more challenging.  While this book isn't a cure-all for this organizational ailment, it will at least get workers thinking.<br /><br />\\"Who Are 'They' Anyway?\\" is obviously a promotional tool for the two authors.  The book concludes with advertisements for supplemental materials and personal lectures or consultations.  But the message is still a worthy one to consider.  Read this book this afternoon, and a red flag will wave before your nose the next time a co-worker complains about a decision that THEY made.  Perhaps you'll be bold enough to initiate the ME / WE practice at that very moment.book concludes with advertisements for supplemental materials and personal lectures or consultations.

The differences here are that (a) the text is solely Thoreau's poetry, and (b) the accompanying visuals are pieces from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  It is Thoreau's *prose* that is most often quoted and reprinted ad infinitum.  In spite of the fact that he described himself as a poet by profession, today Thoreau's poetry is frequently dismissed as being sub-par or not worth considering at all.  This treatment serves to remedy that situation.<br /><br />Here, 52 poems are illustrated with the work of more than 20 artists.  Sixteen of the paintings are from Winslow Homer and six are from John Singer Sargent.  Putting Thoreau's words next to Homer's artwork is a perfect match.  Both men were inspired by the natural world and conveyed their connectedness in their creations.<br /><br />One of the most compelling entries is not Nature-oriented.  \\"I Am the Little Irish Boy\\" tells the story of a youngster whose father was a railroad worker.  The facing page shows Jessie Wilcox Smith's red-haired tyke looking out from her illustration called \\"When Daddy was a Little Boy.\\"  The well-dressed boy in the picture is better off than the one described in the poem, and yet his eyes will catch you and make you think about the similarities instead.<br /><br />This smallish coffee table book could be opened to a different poem and painting each day, it's that nice.

The eccentric antiques / junk dealer of Owls Head, Maine, had eleven acres of stuff piled high, in mounds and mounds, in and around several buildings.  At first the artist in Purcell was intrigued; she was moved to photograph individual objects or random groupings of items.  Then at various times over 20 years, she continued to stop to buy things and to talk to Buckminster himself.  She took the items back to her own studio in Boston, where she arranged and rearranged them into her own special kind of artwork.  And we're not talking about \\"whole\\" objects here -- rather, they include broken toys, books in varying stages of disintegration, pieces of furniture, old lobster traps, window frames, rusted parts of machinery.<br /><br />Gradually Buckminster took on a near-mentor role for Purcell, and it's obvious the two vastly different people came to care about each other.  She took him to museums and doctor?s appointments, he took her to pool halls.  And as they climbed around the junk piles and investigated nooks and crannies in the buildings, Purcell learned more about Buckminster's personal history.  The result is a kind of dual biography pressed against the backdrop of both the antique business and the art world, sometimes questioning which is which.<br /><br />Some of Purcell's b&w photos accompany the text.  But only the photo printed on the cover flyleaves gives us a grander perspective, as a wide shot of the property shows a pile of indecipherable objects stretching from one building to the next, one story high.  Reading this book could be a nightmare for neat freaks. It can be heartening to those of us who are ordinary pack rats by comparison; for even after just a few pages, we can say to ourselves, \\"Well, at least I'm not THAT bad.\\"<br /><br />This is an unusual book, and it's difficult to nail down what audience it might appeal to.  Fellow photographers may be interested in Purcell's process and artist's eye.  Fans of Maine life might enjoy the depiction of the eccentricity of a real Down Easter.  Still others might enjoy a respite from typical genres.  You will certainly look at junk yards differently after reading this one.al to.

The first performance took place on July 6, 1975, in Concord, Mass.  This book appeared three years later.  Here the selections are organized into fourteen chapters that address a variety of topics, such as Gods, On Being a Writer, Friendship and Singularity, and John Brown.  Source footnotes appear in an appendix.  The book begins with an introduction by Thoreau Society secretary Walter Harding.  Selected wood engravings by Michael McCurdy supplement the text. Mr. Childs later went on to become a spokesman for the environmental organization Greenpeace.  In 1998, he published \\"The Spirit's Terrain: Creativity, Activism, and Transformation.\\"<br /><br />This title is just one more in the dozens upon dozens of Thoreau quote books that have been produced since his death.

And whenever he was interested in something or wanted to mull over something, he jotted his findings and his musings in his journals.  David Foster has analyzed the journal entries and has compared all the descriptions of Thoreau's New England landscape of the 19th century with our present-day environment.  The result is a marvelous insight into the complex intertwinings of natural succession and human land use over several centuries.<br /><br />At first glance, you might think this book is just another mere compilation of quotes from Thoreau's journals.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  The chapters address a variety of aspects of the landscape.  Each chapter begins with Foster's original explanation of the topic, and he backs up his interpretations with Thoreau's dated journal entries.  We are fortunate to have these daily observations and to be able to see the pond of \\"Walden\\" fame as a microcosm of the 19th-century New England landscape.  For while Thoreau wrote that he \\"went to the woods,\\" the place he went to was a far cry from what we would now typically call \\"wooded.\\"  Foster says, \\"It is ironic to recognize today, when a high value is placed on nature, wilderness, and old-growth landscape, that America's premier nature writer and propounder of conservation and wilderness values lived at a time when the New England landscape was arguably the most tamed and most dominated by human activity in its entire history.\\" (p. 222)<br /><br />And while the writings of Thoreau are generally approached through American literature classes, we've been remiss in not giving more credence to the *science* in his observations.  He had ideas about sustainability that were unusual and ahead of his time, and we are gradually coming to realize that his notes make perfect sense today.  \\"More than half a century after Thoreau laid out the story of succession in painstaking detail in his journals, his lessons had to be relearned by the forest ecologists at Harvard.\\" (p. 226) David Foster has the benefit of being able to draw on both knowledge bases:  Thoreau's and his own, and he can easily compare the two in this volume.  Indeed, this is exactly the kind of book that Thoreau would have read and would have been captivated by, for he was forming his own theories about the trends he found in Nature.<br /><br />In this volume, Foster puts a new spin on the concept of conservation, preservation, and exactly what is \\"native\\" or \\"a natural state.\\" Every inch of our world has been affected by some sort of human activity.  \\"We are caught in a cultural dilemma in which we seek to maintain what we know and what is becoming rare even though it is largely the consequence of intense human activity.\\" (p. 225)<br /><br />The text is accompanied by the beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations of Abigail Rorer, who has done similiar work for other \\"Thoreau books.\\"  Foster's additional bibliographic essay provides documentation and the processes he went through to conduct his research.  A list of sources plus a 10-page bibliography cap off this work.<br /><br />While this is an easy enough book to read, Foster's narrations and conclusions take time to digest.  They must be savored and absorbed.  The reader needs time to stop and think about what he/she's just read.  So while this is a worthwhile read, it isn't necessarily a quick one.  Recommended for Thoreauvians (of course!), and should also be mandatory study for land managers throughout New England, the Northeast, and in other North American regions.

She was new to the profession, did most of the work by herself, and wasn't always sure she was doing things \\"properly.\\"  Perhaps that's why she kept a journal, jotting down encounters with people and books, and reacting to current events as they affected the library and her town.  The result is a book that's interesting on a variety of levels, as it recounts not only the culture of a possibly simpler time in small-town New England, but also the day-to-day operations of the pre-automated library.  Ms. Lord retired from her position in December 1960.  She has provided for us a nice reminscence of the past.  And yet, for better or for worse, librarians of today will connect and commiserate with Ms. Lord's laments about limited finances, limited space for limited resources, and unruly young adult patrons.  Librarians in similiar small towns and especially in New England will find themselves nodding their heads at Ms. Lord's notes.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.

Thoreau	Books	5	10	10	N	N	A nice compilation for the casual Thoreau reader	When Professor Hyde set out to use selected Thoreau essays in his seminar at Kenyon College, he found no book that contained the writings he wanted. So he created one that did.  The result is this handsome book, made up of 13 political and / or nature essays:  Natural History of Massachusetts ~ A Winter Walk ~ Paradise (to be) Regained ~ Ktaadn ~ Civil Disobedience ~ Walking ~ Slavery in Massachusetts ~ Life Without Principle ~ Autumnal Tints ~ The Succession of Forest Trees ~ A Plea for Captain John Brown ~ The Last Days of John Brown ~ and Wild Apples.<br /><br />Some of these titles are more familiar to us than others, because writings such as \\"Civil Disobedience\\" and \\"Walking\\" appear in dozens (if not hundreds) of compilation volumes.  I found two gems in this book.  The first is Hyde's own introductory essay, \\"Prophetic Excursions,\\" which provides a personal and unique perspective for approaching the genre.  The second is \\"Paradise (to be ) Regained,\\" in which Thoreau reviews the 1842 book, \\"The Paradise within the Reach of all Men, without Labor, by Powers of Nature and Machinery. An Address to all Intelligent Men\\" by J.A. Etzler.  Talk about FUNNY!  Mr. Etzler evidently proposed to use the energy produced by the wind, the tide, the waves, and sunshine in order to power all the machinery needs of mankind.  And Henry shoots him down at every turn!  One wonders what either man would think of our current solar energy efforts and those proposals to put wind farms on Cape Cod.  Of additional interest here are the annotations to the text, in which Hyde lets us in on many of Thoreau's inside jokes and references -- the kinds of remarks that would have been obvious to his contemporaries and to anyone with reading knowledge of classical literature.<br /><br />Even the cover art was well-chosen for this volume.  It's \\"Water Lily,\\" a painting done by American John La Farge in the early 1860s.  The inspiration was obviously taken from \\"Slavery in Massachusetts,\\" when Thoreau stops in the midst of railing against the injustices of the Fugitive Slave Law to talk about the scent of a water lily:<br /><br />\\"It bursts up so pure and fair to the eye, and so sweet to the scent, as if to show us what purity and sweetness reside in, and can be extracted from, the slime and muck of earth.  ... It reminds me that Nature has been partner to no Missouri Compromise. ... The foul slime stands for the sloth and vice of man, the decay of humanity; the fragrant flower that springs from it, for the purity and courage which are immortal.\\" (p. 193)<br /><br />Even in his political essays, Thoreau couldn't avoid making analogies with the natural world.  That's one of the points Lewis Hyde makes with this volume:  you can't separate the natural from the political when you're dealing with Thoreau's writings.  It's impossible to focus on just one or<br /><br />the other.hen Thoreau stops in the midst of railing against the injustices of the Fugitive Slave Law to talk about the scent of a water lily: <br /> <br />\\"It bursts up so pure and fair to the eye, and so sweet to the scent, as if to show us what purity and sweetness reside in, and can be extracted from, the slime and muck of earth.  ...

Written in conversational essay form, the text uses eleven chapters to cover biographical information, writings, and philosophies.  Such briefness assumes that the reader is already familiar with some or most of the details.  This encounter is merely a \\"revisiting.\\"  If you've read the now-standard HDT biographies by Harding, Richardson, or Canby, you won't find many surprises here.  A few observations may jump out at the reader:<br /><br />\\"For a time the companionship of nature seemed a happy substitute for the more exacting association with men and women, and so Thoreau's isolation was at once deepened and made to seem tolerable.  If we may trust certain entries in his journal that become more numerous toward the end, Thoreau was increasingly aware of a growing impoverishment and emptiness in his life.  It is doubtful if he ever realized explicitly that worship of nature is only a thinly disguised form of self-worship, leading to sterility.\\"  (p. 75)<br /><br />\\"Thoreau was not a scientist, and his persistent measuring of the girth of trees, the height of floods, the thickness of ice, and so on would be dismaying in their clumsiness if regarded as attempts to collect scientific data.  But probably they were not that.  They were the awkward caresses that Thoreau lavished on the one consuming love of his life.  He simply could not know enough of the world around him.\\" (p. 79)<br /><br />Today's Thoreauvians may take umbrage at one or both of those assertions.<br /><br />In the preface, the author voices his dismay at the pollution and overuse of Walden Pond in 1945.  \\"Of more concern than the state of Walden's water or the beauty of its shores is the moral heritage of human freedom and loyalty to principle that descends from Thoreau.  Nothing could be more opposite to the totalitarian doctrines of our times than the transcendentalist's belief in the dignity of man and the supremacy of individual conscience over a debased collective authority.  The hope that these ideas may still be cherished and made valid is the mainspring of this essay.\\"  When those words were written, the Second World War was in its final phase, and the fate of mankind must have seemed up in the air.  Perhaps Mr. Whicher's book helped to heal some souls by turning them back 100 years.'s belief in the dignity of man and the supremacy of individual conscience over a debased collective authority.

The naturalist reveals and explains his most popular philosophies to her.  He even takes her to Concord and shows her the town.  Eventually Little Mouse meets Carpenter Mouse, and they make a home together.  I guess we shouldn't be surprised at the relationship between Thoreau and Little Mouse.  \\"Mice and people still get along very well.  They are friends with each other today, just as in Mr. Thoreau's time.\\"<br /><br />Background information about Thoreau appears at the front of the book, along with the excerpt of the mouse episode from \\"Walden.\\"  The book concludes with photos and descriptions of the Emerson house, Concord Museum, and the cabin replica at Walden Pond.<br /><br />At least two children's books have focused on this small tale from \\"Walden.\\"  \\"The Mouse and the Song\\" by Marilynne K. Roach is more subtle in its approach and is not as anthropomorphic as \\"Little Mouse.\\"  While Mr. Montague uses an interesting approach to introduce Thoreau's ideas to children, the text is just too \\"teachy.\\"  In more recent years, D.B.

Roach produced several books which introduced youngsters to the writings and life of Henry David Thoreau.<br /><br />\\"Down to Earth at Walden\\" is partly a biography and partly a streamlined interpretation of \\"Walden.\\"  The chapters generally follow the same topics that Thoreau addressed in his most famous work, and Ms. Roach adds relevant explanatory details about his life.  The text is generally accurate and interesting to read.  Her pen-and-ink illustrations are wonderful!  This book is better simply because of them.<br /><br />Even though this is an historic topic, there could be concerns that this book is dated. The concluding sentence about the pond in Concord, Massachusetts, reads: \\"Current problems of overuse and misuse once again show Walden to be a microcosm of the natural world.\\"  While that statement is general and still true, much has happened at Walden Pond State Reservation since this book was published in 1980.  School libraries still circulating this volume will therefore want to add a more up-to-date Thoreau biography to their shelves.  Public libraries can direct older students to \\"Walden Pond: A History\\" by W. Barksdale Maynard for a comprehensive study of that area.<br /><br />This title is an average introduction to Thoreau's life, but with great illustrations. Perhaps readers will be motivated enough to turn to more current biographies or eventually to \\"Walden\\" itself.	2004-11-03

Roach produced several books which introduced youngsters to the writings and life of Henry David Thoreau.<br /><br />\\"The Mouse and the Song\\" begins by describing the life of Mouse, who lives in an unnamed woods near an unnamed pond.  She leads a typical mouse life, full of the usual dangers and the activity of the food-gathering business.  Mouse eventually encounters a man in the woods, and she eventually grows trustful enough to eat a piece of cheese from his hand.  She is enchanted by the music she hears when he blows through a tube with holes in it. \\"The fox, the owl, the weasel, the hawk were still a part of Mouse's days and nights, but now she had the music as well and it could not be taken from her.\\"  By the end of the book as winter approaches, Mouse finds a new home territory, away from the man and his flute.  She also finds a song of her own and soon sings \\"from the center of her being.\\"<br /><br />A brief foreword tells the reader that this storyline was inspired by the mouse episode in Thoreau's \\"Walden.\\" Otherwise, the text is blissfully unmarked by reminders, thus allowing the reader (child or parent) to choose whether or not to make the connection.  Either way, it's a good story.  As for whether or not mice actually sing -- well, you'll have to make that decision on your own.<br /><br />At least two children's books have focused on this small tale from \\"Walden.\\"  \\"The Mouse and the Song\\" is more subtle in its approach than \\"Little Mouse\\" by Bill Montague, and I like this one better for being so.

Ray Angelo has combed the standard 14 volumes of Thoreau's Journal in search of references to flowers, trees, and other vascular plants. (Mosses, lichens, mushrooms, and fungi are not included.)  This index lists the plants by common name and by Latin name.  [The savvy researcher might want to know both names ahead of time.  Cross-references between the two are used, and the common name entries seem to provide the most \\"hits.\\" But it's probably a good idea to look under both.]  Entries direct the user to the volume and page numbers of the standard 1906 publication of the Journal.  In order to make the most of this book, you have to have access to a copy of the Journal as well.<br /><br />But this work represents more than mere indexing of words.  Ray Angelo took the time to do it right.  If an organism's Latin name has changed since Thoreau's time, he noted it.  If the common name of a plant has changed, he noted it.  If a former variation of a species is now a separate one in its own right, he noted it.  If Thoreau might have used a name in a different way, Angelo figured it out.  He standardized spellings as well.  It took a botanist to assemble this information, and Ray Angelo leads his field.  His essay \\"Thoreau as Botanist,\\" included in this volume, reveals even more details about the transcendental naturalist's botanical studies.  Angelo is known as the person who located the site where Thoreau found the rare \\"climbing fern.\\"  He recently co-authored \\"The Atlas of New England Flora.\\"<br /><br />The Princeton editions of the Journal, still in various stages of ongoing publication, include detailed indexes with each volume.  But you have to look in the back of each book in order to locate specific references.  Angelo's index will continue to provide a shortcut and a competent starting point for researchers and quote-seekers alike.	2004-11-01

Sherman's Army has taken Atlanta and is continuing its march to the sea, aiming for Savannah.  Residents of the area prepare for the worst, based on the stories and rumors they've heard of the atrocies caused by the Union forces.  Twelve-year-old Hattie Lester and her mother Sara live alone on their rice plantation, now that the slaves are gone and Ladron Lester was lost in the war.  Hattie is a tomboy and a spit-fire in her own right, and she can often be seen leading her pig Amelia around on a leash.  Hattie is convinced that she'll reach out and kick any Yankee that tries to come near her.  (And she eventually does!)  Much of this story follows Hattie and her mother as they deal with their situation.<br /><br />Along the way we meet other representative characters who interact with the Lesters and with each other.  Legrand Parmenter is a neighbor and friend to Hattie who leaves to join the fight.  Captain Stephen Hopewell is a reporter attached to the Union army, originally from New York state.  Zip is a newly-released slave who follows the army ranks.  Tybee Jo Swett is a prisoner released from the capital city of Milledgeville, and he makes his way back to Savannah to finish his business.  Alpheus Winks is a Union sergeant from Putnam County, Indiana, whose small band of men \\"forage liberally\\" throughout the countryside.  Isaiah Flegg is a New Jersey carpetbagger who kidnaps blacks and ships them north to substitute for Union men choosing not to fight.  The Drewgoods are relatives of the Lesters who deem themselves in a higher class.  And then there's General William Tecumseh Sherman himself, who makes a few appearances and interactions of his own.<br /><br />\\"Savannah\\" is not as long or as detailed as past Jakes volumes, and it is not the best book he's ever written.  It's still worthy of reading, though, especially since it highlights a portion of our history that I suspect is unfamiliar to many of us.  And it will surprise those readers who believe the same stories and rumors that Hattie and her mother heard before encountering the Yankees themselves.ose readers who believe the same stories and rumors that Hattie and her mother heard before encountering the Yankees themselves.	2004-10-25

Her mother explains to her the kind of things she would do if she were a writer.  She would work with words and think of the right ones to use.  She would *show* a story, not tell about it.  She would let the storyline gell in her mind before writing it down.  Melia's mother also gives her some tips on how to get started and how to get ideas from the world around her. By the end of the book, Melia practices doing each task and is on her way to becoming a writer.<br /><br />\\"If You Were a Writer\\" could be put into the hands of grade-schoolers who show affinity for writing or who need some guidance in beginning to write on their own.

Eddie likes to both read and write.  His teacher encourages him by saying, \\"We are all authors with important stories inside us.\\"  Each child has prepared a question for the author.  Eddie's question is: \\"How do you write books that have parts meant for me?\\"  But during the author's presentation, Eddie doesn't get a chance to ask his question.  The author sees him afterward and makes a special effort to talk with him and give him a chance to pose his question in person.  Eddie is awed by the experience, and he intends to write about it.<br /><br />While the identity of \\"The Author\\" is kept anonymous throughout the text -- a technique that lends even *more* mystique to the specialness of her appearance -- this book is obviously an autobiographical story for Borden and is based on her own school visits.  The narration is told in such a way that the reader's anticipation builds just like it would if we were looking forward to meeting a celebrity ourselves.  We've all been there. Even adults become nervous and tongue-tied when faced with speaking to someone they admire and respect.  Thus does this book transcend audience level.  We can *all* relate to Eddie's situation.<br /><br />Adam Gustavson's realistic paintings add greatly to the story.  They convey freeze-frames of realistic emotion from every character, especially of Eddie and The Author.<br /><br />This title is certainly useful for preparing elementary students for author visits.  Secondarily, it's highly recommended for aspiring writers of *any* age who seek advice from \\"a real author.\\"	2004-10-20

He spends time fishing, reading, hanging out with his dog Ralph Waldo, and working in Kate's Bait and Tackle Shop.  The first mystery is:  Who is Stoney, really?  He knows he was released by a veteran's hospital in Virginia five years ago.  Severe amnesia prevents him -- and us -- from knowing the rest of his history.  Occasional deja-vu moments and dreams provide fleeting glimpses of people and circumstances from \\"before.\\"  Sometimes Stoney finds himself doing things he didn't know he could do, and he struggles to piece together an imagined identity based on his newly-rediscovered talents.  What a gift to the reader!  We get to learn more about Stoney just as he is learning about himself.  Not many books honor us in that manner.<br /><br />As intriguing as *that* mystery may be, a second one quickly emerges. Stoney's friend Lyle is missing, along with the Florida tourist that he took on a fishing outing.  When Stoney later finds Lyle's body, he feels obligated to begin his own investigation of the murder.  Thus does this second mystery hinge on the first, for Stoney's methodical strategy indicates to him (and to us) that his past might have included police or military experience.  Even the local sheriff senses that Stoney is not crazy and knows what he's doing, and he welcomes the extra help in solving the case.<br /><br />While a satisfying conclusion eventually brings the murder mystery to a close, we're still left with questions about Stoney Calhoun's identity.  Should we believe the struck-by-lightning story the officials gave him? Who is the Man in the Suit who shows up from time to time?  What source is sending money to Stoney?  Will he ever remember his past, and will he ever know the real cause of his hospital stay?  And if he remembers, what will become of his relationship with Kate?<br /><br />Mr. Tapply is a worthy angler who has tied an intricate fly, sure to successfully lure all of us hungry mystery-devourers into the current of a new character-driven series.

The 35-year old corporate executive not only holds a dream job; she's also acquired skyrocketing fame because of her involvement with the TV show, \\"The Apprentice.\\"  Millions of us watch the program each week in order to see Donald Trump issue those classic final words to an unsuccessful candidate.  But it's Carolyn that the fans, especially women, are now seeking out for business advice.  Hence the need for this book.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with the text of an actual e-mail sent to Carolyn: one from a fan, asking a basic business question.  Her expansive answers draw on her personal experiences and the business sense she has gleaned throughout the course of her career.  Through these stories, we learn of her transformation from Avon-selling teen to high school volleyball captain; from waitress to Manhattan restaurant manager; and from country club director of sales and marketing, to general manager of Trump National Golf Club, and finally to her current position as an EVP and COO in the Trump Organization.  Along the way, Ms. Kepcher addresses such topics as employee-boss relationships, management styles, job searches, qualities of a good manager, qualities of a good employee, qualities of a good company, team-forging, and women's and family issues in the workplace.  The chapters are sprinkled with Carolyn 101 maxims -- 68 of them!  Each one could be printed and posted as a desk-side reminder for motivation.  Examples are:<br /><br />\\"You're the one in charge of your learning curve.\\"<br /><br />\\"Be the real thing, because all the highfalutin' pictures in the world won't hide it if you aren't.\\"<br /><br />\\"In the absence of trust, even the most generous act seems questionable.\\"<br /><br />\\"It is appropriate to go above your boss's head when he or she is managing you to fail.\\"<br /><br />\\"Never forget that today's mailroom clerk could be tomorrow's manager.\\"<br /><br />\\"The biggest office isn't always the best.\\"<br /><br />\\"A bad apple with a bad attitude can compromise the team.\\"<br /><br />\\"The best team is the team that continues to perform even when the manager is absent.\\"<br /><br />\\"Succeeding at difficult tasks is what will make you great.\\"<br /><br />And the resounding cry repeated throughout the text is the Trump credo: \\"If one of us succeeds, we all succeed.  If one of us fails, we all fail.\\"  This stuff may sound trite to an MBA graduate, but it obviously works.<br /><br />This book came to me at an appropriate time.  Six months ago I resigned from a management position (under a \\"toxic boss,\\" I've figured out, thanks to this book), and next week I will begin working in a new job with another organization.  Ms. Kepcher's words were self-affirming and inspirational to me, coming as they did after tedious months of answering ads, mailing letters and resumes, and going to interviews.  I now recognize my management style, and I now know what kind of environment I want to foster for my new fellow employees.  I highly recommend \\"Carolyn 101\\" to anyone becoming a manager for the first time. I recommend it to anyone who's currently \\"between jobs.\\"  It'll help them work through the inevitable \\"could have, would have, should have\\" introspections.  I recommend it to folks who have had at least two different bosses and/or employers, because readers who have had a variety of work experiences will better relate to the situations described here.  And yes, the book will be helpful to recent college grads looking to enter the business world.  But they should keep the volume in a safe place, because they're sure to want to come back to it again once they have some of their own comparisons to make.<br /><br />Though \\"Carolyn 101\\" was obviously published quickly in order to capitalize on the TV show success, it is not a fluff piece with a short shelf-life.  It is well-written and thought-provoking.  And I suspect it will not be the last time we'll benefit from Carolyn Kepcher's insights and advice inprint.	2004-09-29

The assorted ruminations cover the genre of nature writing, overdevelopment of Cape Cod beaches, Ultimate Frisbee games and teams, the writing life, urban vs. rural life, family relationships, and a side trip to the jungle of Belize, all capped off with a coyote trilogy.  But as the reader progresses from one selection to another, a unified theme becomes clear.  This book is an exploration of all aspects of wildness -- in the author, in other humans, in animals, in habitats.  Gessner poses the fundamental questions and struggles to provide reasonable answers.  What is wildness?  Where is it?  Is it fair to study wild animals via an electronic scientific method?  And is a wild turkey still wild if it struts along the back alleys of Boston?<br /><br />Devout animal lovers, be warned:  David Gessner puts realism into his nature writing and glosses over neither death nor decay.  If you prefer your nature Disney-fied, rent a movie.  Not to be missed in this book:  the imaginary Nature Writers party on pages 4 and 5, and what might happen if Edward Abbey slipped alcohol into Thoreau's water glass.<br /><br />These are thought-provoking essays that are recommended reading for nature lovers, nature writers, and memoir fans.  At the very least, you'll start studying shadows for coyote shapes.	2004-09-19

Only a few of the selections run longer than a dozen pages, so this is a perfect volume for browsers.  The writings are grouped by topic, and Finch first provides appropriate background and explanation for each section.  More than mere introductions, these summaries draw on his vast knowledge of the genre and include asides that reveal his own wry wit.  Skim through these pages and you'll proceed from early settlement histories and biographies, to whaling and seafaring, to Cape Cod nature and summer vacations.  My favorite episodes are about the activities of the \\"mooncussers\\" and the \\"wreckers\\" who throughout the years salvaged remnants from the inevitable shipwrecks along the dangerous coastline.  (Probably more than 3000 ships have been grounded and/or lost around the peninsula's circumference since 1627.)  There truly is something for everyone here.  Finch thoughtfully provides mini-bios of all 67 writers and always notes sources; so if a particular entry strikes your fancy, you'll be able to track down the original work for more in-depth reading.

Well, Cape Cod history precedes the arrival of the Pilgrims in 1620.  And that doesn't even count the native settlements that predated European arrivals. A few centuries is a lot of ground to cover in one volume.<br /><br />First published in 1930, this book is a detailed history of the peninsula. The text might look dry and dusty at first, but it's got its interesting moments. Kittredge traces the naming and settlement of every Cape town and moves mostly chronologically through time, with a few backtracks to cover special topics like religion, wars, the canal, whaling and fisheries. Of utmost importance, of course, is the continuing relationship of the residents to the sea.  Some of the most fascinating (and brutal and tragic) stories can be found in the \\"Storms, Wrecks, and Wreckers\\" chapter.  Truly sobering is the reproduction of a map showing the location of every known shipwreck off Cape Cod just from 1880 to 1903, when 540 wrecks were reported.  That's a staggering number to consider.<br /><br />On the lighter side is the chapter regarding the construction of the Canal.  Cutting a waterway through the Buzzard's Bay area had been an occasional topic of conversation and speculation since 1676.  But the final product, the current canal, wasn't started until the 20th century, and it opened for business on July 4, 1914.  Getting to that point makes for fun reading.<br /><br />For this second edition, local naturalist John Hay provided an Epilogue covering major changes during the years 1930-1968.  That's when tourism became a key part of the economy and also when the National Seashore was created.  He touches on conservation issues and the beginning efforts to protect the unique landscape that entices vacationers, part-time residents, and year-rounders alike.<br /><br />Readers without enough time for details might be better off with the more recent and thinner release, \\"Cape Cod Companion,\\" by Jack Sheedy and Jim Coogan.

First published in 1948, \\"Northern Farm\\" recounts a calendar year's worth of rural life in that northern clime.  Brrrr.<br /><br />The chronological narrative begins as the Bestons return to their snow-covered fields and ice-capped pond after celebrating the Christmas season with friends in New York.  Each chapter combines factual events with entries from Beston's farm diary, plus his summary philosophical statements.  And boy, does winter sure seem to last a long time! It frames the progression of the book.  Thankfully Beston takes the opportunity to describe the wildlife he's able to encounter between snowstorms.  An overwhelming sense of community surfaces here as well.  Remember: this story takes place in a farming landscape just after WWII, before a television could be found in every living room, and when people relied on each other for help during challenging times.  They were the kind of times when you left a lantern burning in the front room so that you could more easily find your way home after attending a church supper on a rainy night.  \\"The good old days,\\" for some.<br /><br />In addition to his notes about managing a small farm and following Nature's course, Beston ruminates about international issues.  The war is still fresh in his mind, and he needs to speak about it.  Read in post-9/11 times, his comments strike an eerie chord of familiarity.  For example:<br /><br />\\"No age in history can afford to lay too much emphasis upon 'security.' The truth is from our first breath to our last we inhabit insecurely a world which must of transitory nature be insecure, and that moreover any security we do achieve is but a kind of an illusion.  While admitting that a profound instinct towards such safety as we can achieve is part of our animal being, let us also confess that the challenge involved in mere existence is the source of many of the greater virtues of human character.\\"  (page 47, in my paperback copy)<br /><br />Wow!

Through these extensive descriptions, we can accompany Thoreau to Wachusett and Greylock in Massachusetts; to Katahdin and Kineo in Maine; and to the Vermont and New Hampshire peaks of Wantastiquet, the Fall Mountains, the White Mountains (Washington, Tuckerman Ravine, Lafayette), and Monadnock.  Howarth periodically added sidebars of contemporary geography to the naturalist's words and experiences so that the devoted reader could have directions to attempt to retrace the 19th-century naturalist's steps.  Obviously Howarth did the hikes himself.  But we discover through Howarth's notes that sometimes Thoreau wasn't even sure of his location.  Sometimes he flat out misidentified landmarks or tree species.  Therein lies part of the fun, of course: correcting historical documentation.  We can also see how the New England landscape has changed over the past century and a half.  We know that we have more woodland than Thoreau saw or encountered, and that our current views from mountain summits aren't the same as his were. Still, it's interesting to read about the way it was and to share in Thoreau's continual wonder at the natural world.<br /><br />This volume has been updated by a newer edition called \\"Walking with Thoreau: A Literary Guide to the New England Mountains.\\"  Either book is especially recommended for hikers.	2004-08-27

He approaches the book reluctantly at first as he remembers hearing that \\"the author was a sour curmudgeon,\\" for Mulloney \\"had enough live curmudgeons to deal with.\\"  But Thoreau's descriptions of walking through the Cape towns strike a chord with Mulloney -- so much so, that he decides to recreate and follow the naturalist's treks along the outer Cape banks.<br /><br />And so the adventure begins.  Mulloney isn't a plan-ahead kind of guy, which gets him into a bit of a bind when he tries to find last-minute lodging on Labor Day weekend.  He even forgets to take drinking water along as he hikes.  These oversights seem minor as he discovers for himself the beauty of the sand, the ocean, and the flora and fauna (including humans) he encounters on the way.  Readers learn about this dynamic landscape from the author's personal, conversational manner.  You can almost feel the warm sand scrunching between your toes.  Mulloney miscalculates and doesn't have enough time to complete the journey in one stint; he has to return over Columbus Day weekend to finish the path of the original walk.<br /><br />David Gessner similarly tells of his own re-enactment of Thoreau's on-foot Cape travels in a section of \\"A Wild Rank Place: One Year on Cape Cod.\\"  The two men cover the same territory within a few years of each other and find slightly different (and mostly positive) experiences.  Both accounts are worth reading, even if you're not the hiking type or even a Thoreauvian.  The dual conclusion is clear:  When you're walking, you see a more vivid Cape Cod than the one you can see from a car window.	2004-08-25

With each turn of a page, we advance two hours and encounter a variety of creatures, from moose to dragonfly.  The two-hour intervals begin at 6 a.m. and continue until the next morning at 6 a.m.  Wadsworth's natural information is good, and Kratter's paintings combine well with the words to make it a unified presentation.  His colorful illustrations have a watery, river-like look to them, which are just perfect for this book.<br /><br />\\"River Discoveries\\" is great for reading aloud at story hour and for introducing children of any age to a river habitat.  The helpful end-page glossary defines concepts that might be new to the youngest readers.<br /><br />This is a book that young nature lovers will never outgrow.  In fact, it's difficult to close the cover and put the book aside.  When you finish it once, you find yourself turning right back to the beginning and reading through it again.	2004-08-20

The stories are organized generally chronologically and by such topics as first settlement, business ventures, shipwrecks, lighthouses and lightships, military endeavors, and interesting people and places.  They uncover some fascinating bits of lore that an ordinary resident or reader might not know.  This is not a straightforward history of any of the towns, but it's good enough for a taste of each one.  Great for visitors who like to know more about the scenery around them -- especially the odd and unusual stuff!  A few minor errors and lack of a map prevent this otherwise-nifty book from getting a five-star rating.	2004-08-19

White: A Biography	Books	4	19	19	N	N	A  good biography that's inspirational to writers	He's so much more than \\"Charlotte's Web\\" or \\"Stuart Little\\"! Read a volume of E.B. White's essays first and follow it up with this biography, and then you'll know almost everything about the man and his work. Author Scott Elledge was fortunate enough to have corresponded and visited with White; this work is therefore as accurate and as personal as one can be. It begins with the birth of Elwyn Brooks \\"Andy\\" White in Westchester County, N.Y., and follows his path to the West Coast as a young man and eventually back to New York and The New Yorker magazine, with diversions to a farm in Maine. The chapters about The New Yorker offices are the most interesting to those of us curious about how that publication works. And don't take that \\"Elements of Style\\" paperback on your bookshelf for granted! (And who *was* Strunk, anyway?) You'll learn here why White got involved in that project and what work went into its revision.<br /><br />This book includes more than 30 pages of photos, illustrations, and original essay drafts. It's fascinating to see White's penciled editorial changes over his own typewritten paragraphs.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of E.B. White, fans of The New Yorker magazine, and writers of all genres.	2004-08-18

Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges.  Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from.  Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text.  The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004).  Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond.  Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.<br /><br />\\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" by Jeffrey S. Cramer was released in August 2004, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the original publication date.  Cramer is the curator of collections for The Thoreau Institute and therefore has access to some of the best primary and secondary source material available -- including Walter Harding's notes.  In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few \\"extras\\": an introduction to Thoreau's life but only as it applies to his cabin stay and WALDEN writing; a bibliography; notes on the text; and a detailed index.  The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- are quite extensive.  They are set off from the WALDEN text with page-within-a-page graphic detailing and are easy to read.  Cramer did not merely merge Van Doren Stern's and Harding's previous notes with those from David Gorman Rohman's dissertation.  His analysis at times echoes that of Harding, but when it does, Cramer often goes one step further with a definition or citation.  He has thoughtfully used a \\"Notes on the Text\\" appendix to outline HDT's wording differences in the various drafts of the work.  Thus his annotations are not bogged down by minor editorial alterations that the casual reader may not care about.  Unlike Harding, Cramer refrains from expressing personal opinions and lets the research speak for itself. An added bonus is a reproduction of Edward Emerson's map of Walden Pond which shows the location of Thoreau's bean-field as Waldo's son remembered it.  The only cumbersome quality in this publication is the placement of WALDEN chapter titles at the bottom of the pages instead of the top.  This otherwise stellar volume is beautifully presented with a cover photo of the cabin reproduction as it currently stands in Walden Pond State Recreation Area. A classy edition by all accounts.<br /><br />Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal.  Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.<br /><br />\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\"  (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life?  Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses?  Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph.  He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more.  His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\"  Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories.  At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\"  So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.<br /><br />\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\"  (\\"Conclusion\\")  Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts thatThoreau was fond of reading at the time?  Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript?  Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life.  Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement.  Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with \\"It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau.\\"  In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.<br /><br />Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text.  Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others.  I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three.  Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that \\"Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in\\" is NOT about fishing at all.<br /><br />Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions.  Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions.  If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book.  If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his.  Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by Jeffrey Cramer.

More than 70 vignettes are organized into seven chapters, with topics as varied as tourists, black flies, yard sales, county fairs, funky mailboxes, and town meetings.  McDonald confirms as true the rumor that people \\"from away\\" who order delivery of live lobsters often discard them because the creatures they receive aren't red.  Many Mainers report relatives or far-flung friends making that costly (and silly) error.<br /><br />This easy and fun read gives you the flavor of Maine, and natives will certainly relate to it.  It's especially funny if you've been there as a tourist and can laugh at yourself and the traffic you cause.  Some tales are similar to ones told in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and the New York Adirondacks.  Is it just the northern climate that makes people so interesting, or do the long winters themselves lead to such storytelling?  Some of these narrations are simply universal, and Maine is merely the background.  More than a few of them will have you nodding and smiling.<br /><br />This book is more substantial (and quite frankly, funnier) than typical regional humor paperbacks.  Forget all those you-know-you're-from-[location] throwaway joke books available at tacky rest stops and order this one instead.  You'll be better off.<br /><br />Attention fiction readers:  Mr. McDonald seems to be a real-life version of Jim Qwilleran, the character made famous by Lilian Jackson Braun's \\"Cat Who\\" mysteries.  If you like reading items from \\"The Qwill Pen,\\" you'll enjoy the stories in this book, even if you've never set foot in Maine.	2004-08-12

Cramer, 2004).  Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond.  Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.<br /><br />\\"The Annotated Walden\\" by Philip Van Doren Stern was first released in 1970.  The editor had also worked with the writings of Thomas de Quincey, Edgar Allan Poe, and Abraham Lincoln.  In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes many \\"extras\\":  an extensive Thoreau biography, details about the original publication, a lifetime chronology based on Thoreau's journal entries, photos of people and places featured in HDT's life and in Concord, selected woodcuts illustrative of the time, a bibliography, an index, and an annotated version of the essay CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.  The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- shed some light on the more complex references and turns of phrase.  But Van Doren Stern was  preoccupied with editorial minutiae: alternative phrasing between the final text and similiar journal entries, or how the final text differed from a previous draft or manuscript.  As a result, these stylistic notes dominate the margins that should really offer more explanation of interest to the general reader, often making the annotations less than useful or interpretive.  The index is merely a general one and doesn't help to pinpoint key passages.  On the other hand, the volume is very visual and is more comprehensive than the others because of the photos, biographical material, and addition of CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE.  The text of WALDEN used here is a photographic reproduction of the printing used in the very first edition, which also makes this<br /><br />volume unique.<br /><br />Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal.

Harding was a founding member of the Thoreau Society and devoted his entire life to the man and his writings. He is still regarded as *the* HDT expert of the 20th century.  In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few \\"extras\\":  a four-page forward that contains a biographical summary; a bibliography; journal entries and original HDT sketches scattered throughout the book's margins (a favorite Harding technique); and a special appendix regarding the story about \\"a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove.\\"  The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- define a number of references both in word and phrase.  Harding didn't copy anything from Van Doren Stern's previous work, and he also didn't include as many stylistic comments as his predecessor.  He offered more frequent explanations and backed them up with a variety of source materials.  He also throws in his own opinion every once in a while.  The occasional ink doodlings from the journals serve well to break up the text.  But lack of an index is a major failing.

Young students will learn much more here than they'll find in an encyclopedia entry, and the text is written in an easy reading style. Much emphasis focuses on the love of the natural world, which is perfect for a book on this topic. The concept of transcendentalism is even approached: &quot;By being close to nature, we can get a hint of the spirit that *transcends* (is above) material things. All we have to do is get away from useless, routine activities, go outdoors, and listen to nature as it speaks to us.&quot; Some scholarly descriptions don't make as much sense as those two sentences do.<br /><br /> However, readers should be warned that some details here are not quite accurate. For example, you cannot see the foundation stones of Henry's Walden Pond hut, as the author states. Granite markers outline its original perimeter, but they were installed in the 20th century. The most blatant error occurs on pages 12 and 13, where a photo of the North Bridge appears. The text claims that Henry and his brother John often walked across that bridge. Wrong! When they were alive, no bridge spanned the river at that site. The one the Minutemen used in 1775 was gone and had not yet been replaced. The current wooden bridge wasn't built until the 20th century. The Concord of today is not a carbon copy of the Concord of the mid-1800s.<br /><br /> Yet the basic information presented here is good. School libraries will want more options than just this one on their biography shelves. Families should supplement this book with others on the market to give children an accurate portrayal of our first American environmentalist.	2004-08-05
US	52987415	RUUQYP21WVNXI	0802117767	464236800	Hawthorne in Concord	Books	4	5	6	N	N	More than Hawthorne AND more than Concord	Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) and his wife Sophia Peabody Hawthorne spent a total of just eight years of married life in Concord, Massachusetts. Those years were spread out over three decades. Yet the couple's extended familial and social circles included many names known to Concordians then and to us today: the Emersons, Alcotts, Stowes and Peabodys; Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, Horace Mann, Horace Greeley, Ellery Channing, William Dean Howells, Samuel Hoar, and Nathan Appleton; publishers James Fields and William Ticknor; and Nathaniel's college friends, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Franklin Pierce. The Hawthornes were in the thick of the 19th-century New England literary life that had Concord at its very center. Their residency can thus be used as a focal point to study the time and its place in history.<br /><br /> While this book attempts to do just that, it delves into more lives than just the Hawthornes (as noted above) and travels as far away as Italy. It follows tangents to their end but always eventually returns to Nathaniel and Sophia and to their two Concord homes, the Old Manse and the Wayside. The details of the pair's devotion and amazing romance may surprise those readers who remember only the dark themes of short stories read in high school English class. It's difficult to fathom that the same pen that wrote &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and &quot;The Minister's Black Veil&quot; also wrote adoring love letters to his Dove.<br /><br /> I found the writing style a bit unnerving to follow, as the narrative overlaps itself and doesn't always follow strict chronological order. Nevertheless, this book should prove of interest to anyone who enjoys the transcendental period of American literature and history. For a full biography of Hawthorne, look elsewhere.	2004-08-01

Englishman Walter Hatch built the original structure in 1647. Ownership passed through 9 or 10 generations of Hatches until 1965, when it left Hatch hands and Messer's parents bought the house. Thus is the author linked to her subject.<br /><br /> She alternates between her own family's history and that of the Hatches, tracing both the fate of the individuals and the imprint each left on the house. There are additions, renovations, fires and restorations. Relatives move away and others come back. Time passes, and the Red House outlives all of its inhabitants. And all along the underlying question is: Whose house is it, really?<br /><br /> &quot;The house contains both the living and the dead, and there are always traces, because the house is not separate, has not one owner but many, has many beams, many different panes of glass, the way a body might have many lovers, the way each owner might look at the house as if at the body of a lover. If the window is removed, is it still a part of the house? If the fireplace swing-arm is taken and put in a museum, is it no longer a part of the house? Can the house be removed from itself? The owner, the past, the parts of the house. I thought: Who can steal a house? Who owns the lover but the loved?&quot; (p. 234)<br /><br /> This reader cannot help but be reminded of a farmhouse in her own past: one that's been in her family since 1915 and might not survive the decade with that surname on the mailbox. But that's a story for another day.<br /><br /> To delve into this fascinating book is to relive the cultural and coastal history of the Bay State through the lives of one extended family, and to further ponder one's own footprint left on the earth. Highly recommended for all who know of such homes and who want not only to restore and remember them, but to also know intimately the souls who once spent (and perhaps STILL spend) time there.once spent (and perhaps STILL spend) time there. <br />	2004-07-26
US	52987415	R1Q2PY1E5JLSR6	1553956478	846976733	Cape Cod Summers	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	An entertaining reminiscence told in two voices	Paul Vaughn grew up as Paul Fithian in the Boston area. He was one of those lucky kids who spent a month on Cape Cod each summer of his childhood. He remembers those days -- mostly in the 1940s -- in 41 vignettes written from his point of view back then. Each short chapter ends with observations and explanations from Paul today.<br /><br />  Paul the Younger is obsessed with all the things that typically make up a child's world: Eating ice cream, candy, and clam chowdah (usually in that order). Encountering bees, blowfish, bluefish, blue crabs, seaworms, ticks, lightning bugs, Northern Lights. Playing family card games, rowing a little red boat, caddying at a local golf course, mistrusting alien New Yorkers, and above all, fantasizing about Doris Day. He tries to survive each day as the youngest of three brothers. He wonders about girls, he ponders his future, he wishes he could communicate better with his retarded Uncle Clyde, and he finds amazement in how little the adults around him truly know him.<br /><br />  Paul the Older comments on each story from his perspective 50 years later. He's older and wiser, is a father himself and now lives in California. The stories are his, of course, and it's as if he's sharing them with the reader in the comfort of his own living room.<br /><br />  The result is an easy read that at times is chuckle-out-loud funny. A nice diversion for anyone with similar Cape childhood memories, or anyone who wants to remember what it's like to see the universe through the eyes of a child.	2004-07-23

Young Edward has two passions:  keeping time with John Philip Sousa marches, and watching the wild ducks fly over his native Tennessee hills. When one duckling appears to be lost, Edward adopts him as his own and takes care of him ... even insisting upon taking the little guy to work.  The hotel staff help Edward hide his pet from Mr. Schutt, the hotel manager.  When the secret leaks out and Mr. Schutt demands an explanation, Edward demonstrates how he has trained the duck to march and maneuver to Sousa marches.  Mr. Schutt is impressed but gives Edward a test project:  just one month to train a whole flock of ducks to march to the hotel lobby fountain and to swim there all day.  Of such stuff are legends born!  Edward succeeds and becomes the Duckmaster of the Peabody Hotel, and the flock is led by his first adoptee, now dubbed John Philip Duck.<br />Patricia Polacco's illustrations are deceptively simple yet vibrantly rich. They look as if one of us has colored in someone else's freehand line drawings -- until you see the outlines of the glasses on the tablecloth and the shadows of the china on the wall.  The hills around the Pembroke house look as wild as the high-class Peabody Hotel is distinguished. The pictures match the storyline.<br />This colorful and entertaining book should amuse both children and adults.  And if you've never witnessed the twice-daily Peabody mallard march, you may have to schedule a trip to Memphis after reading this fictionalized explanation.  Seeing is believing!	2004-07-18

Kinsey Millhone is hired merely to retrieve Reba from prison and deliver her charge to her wealthy father's home.  But the two women connect, and Kinsey becomes an ally while Reba seeks to right personal wrongs.  Perhaps it's about time Kinsey had a real female friend to hang with.  The only other woman present in her daily life is Rosie, the Hungarian restauranteur who dismisses orders and instead shoves plates of her own chosen fare before customers.  In spite of Kinsey's best judgment, she follows Reba.  At the same time, our favorite private investigator is also beginning to date a cop named Cheney.  Hurray!  She needs both of these relationships.  I hope they continue in future books.<br />The details of an embezzlement and money-laundering scheme aren't as action-packed as other cases Kinsey has handled in the past, but they're still engaging.  I welcome some of the descriptions because I've never been to California or Nevada to see the landscape for myself.  Also refreshing is our return to the year 1987, when over-reliance on computers has not yet taken hold, and when Kinsey scarfs down Quarter Pounders with Cheese and Egg McMuffins with such intensity, it's as if someday someone would question their nutritional value and/or healthiness!  You go, girl!<br />At first I intended to give this title a 4-star rating.  That was before I read the last 30 pages.  Grafton need not apologize for this installment in the series.	2004-07-17

Adriana Trigiani is a genuine romantic, and this novel shows it even more than her previous volumes do.  Her characters believe in love at first sight, the endurance of love, the power of strong women, the need to live personal truths, and the importance of family and of ancestral heritage (i.e., Italian).  Other reviewers have spoken to the plot of &quot;The Queen of the Big Time,&quot; so I need not repeat it here.  Yes, you'll need a few tissues on hand, especially when you reach the Epilogue.

From 1800 to 1870 tuberculosis was responsible for one out of every five deaths.  Paying little attention to geography, social class, or age, it struck rich and poor, young and old, and urban and rural residents.&quot;  These statistics in Rothman's introduction are tragic enough.  The narratives that follow are even sadder.<br />Consumption -- as it was known at the time -- was thought to be either inherited or the result of a sedentary life.  (The communicable tubercle bacillus wasn't discovered until 1882.)  Doctors focused on a three-pronged cure for their male patients of means:  daily exercise, a good diet, and travel to a better climate.  On the other hand, female patients were told to handle their domestic duties as best as possible and to get assistance from single female family members who could move in temporarily.  Invalids and their families eventually dealt with the inevitable outcome and prepared for death.  In the twentieth century, patients were sent off to sanatoriums.  Chances are good that someone in your ancestry was affected.  At the very least, they knew people who were.<br />This book is revealing because it is written from the patient's viewpoint and with the individuals in mind.  Letters and diaries of consumptives show that people commiserated with fellow sufferers and exchanged news of symptoms and possible curative measures.  The focus of the story-telling is thus very personal rather than medical.  It makes for compelling reading.<br />&quot;Living in the Shadow of Death&quot; is mandatory reading for anyone interested in life in the United States in the 1800s and early 1900s.  Genealogists and academic researchers in the humanities (especially literature and history) should put this title on their to-read list.  &quot;The good old days&quot; really weren't.	2004-07-07

Gina Stebbins is going through a tough time, and Sophie is on hand to be her cheerleader, coach and companion.  When Gina gets the almost-crazy notion that a trip from Massachusetts to Booley, Ireland, will give her all the answers, Sophie goes along to lend her support.  Quite unexpectedly, Booley casts its magic on Sophie instead.  Gina quickly goes back home, and  Sophie remains to take over the identity left behind by craftswoman Finola O'Flynn.<br />Finola was everyone's friend and confidant when she lived in Booley.  Her influence seems to be everywhere.  Her name graces the shop where Sophie finds work, where the boss was once Finola's lover.  Sophie eases into Finola's shoes -- reluctantly, at first; and then with more confidence as she often ponders what an independent woman like Finola would do in any situation.  As is often the case, the myth is grander than the reality.  Sophie turns out to be a better Finola than Finola really is/was.<br />Shea's first-person characters are always observant.  Sophie compares everything she sees to her personal knowledge base of brand-name products, popular music, and classic television shows.  She thinks the way we Baby Boomers think, which makes for fun reading.  The culture and conversational style of the Irish are also well presented here, as are the idiosyncracies of American tourists.  If the stereotype fits...<br />&quot;Becoming Finola&quot; is good entertainment that may entice readers to think about international travel themselves; or at the very least, to search high and low for inspirational bead-and-charm bracelets with magic powers.  Perhaps there's a Booley waiting out there for each one of us.	2004-07-03

It could also serve as an introduction to the lives of major authors.  Featured here are home descriptions for Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Eugene O'Neill, Edith Wharton, Helman Melville, William Cullen Bryant, Emily Dickinson, Bronson Alcott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier,  Robert Frost, and Sarah Orne Jewett.  Each entry begins with a detailed line-drawing view of the house by illustrator Tom Siebert.  It's followed by basic site information, an author photo, author chronology and extensive biography.  Site information should be checked with another source, for hours and admission prices are sure to be different now.  Each site has a web page by this time too.  I've visited 8 of the 19 homes described here, and I can tell you that while much of the information is applicable, at least few major site changes have taken place for the better.  Emily Dickinson's home in Amherst, Mass., has undergone administrative changes, and it's now more accessible than it used to be.  At Walden Pond, a replica of Thoreau's cabin now stands next to the parking lot, while the original site is a brisk walk away along the far north side of the pond.  The book also includes 11 pages listing other minor literary sites in New England.  If you enjoy reading the works of these authors and want to see where they created them, this guide is for you.  Someone should produce a third edition that's up-to-date.	2004-06-25

Copplestone traces the history and origins of the technique, then follows with brief biographies of some of the best-known River School artists.  Featured are:<br />Thomas Doughty (1793-1856)<br />Thomas Cole (1801-1848)<br />Asher Brown Durand (1796-1886)<br />John Frederick Kensett (1816-1872)<br />Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902)<br />Jasper Francis Cropsey (1823-1900)<br />Robert Scott Duncanson (1821-1872)<br />Thomas Worthington Whittredge (1820-1910)<br />Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900)<br />Sanford Robinson Gifford (1823-1880)<br />Martin Johnson Heade (1819-1904)<br />Thomas Moran (1827-1926)<br />Charles Codman (1800-1842)<br />The book is illustrated with 45 plates of original paintings.  Each artist listed above has from one to seven plates of his work included.  &quot;Extras&quot; are single examples from James Hamilton and George Peter Alexander Healy without biographical information.<br />Unfortunately, the placement of the plates doesn't seem to follow any order.  Appropriate plates are not necessarily adjacent to artist biographies.  Alfred Bierstadt's &quot;Niagara Falls&quot; is included *twice*, while Frederic Edwin Church's depiction of the Falls is much better known and is even mentioned in his bio, but there's no visual.  The lack of an index also makes it tricky to match the artists with their work.<br />If you like the Hudson River School style and want just a brief sampling for your reference library, you'll find this volume to be a reasonably-priced option.  If you really want to dive into the genre, look elsewhere.	2004-06-18

Once it was a peninsula inhabited in the past by Indians and then later by summer tourists.  Over time, Nature and conservationists intervened.  A powerful Nor'easter caused a separation with the mainland in 1958; twenty years later, a blizzard broke that island in half.  Now that the Monomoy area is part of the Refuge system, its human visitors are most often only birders, fishermen, and scientists.<br />Cairn's essay-like chapters reveal Monomoy's history and its unique flora and fauna, told with the pen of the intimate insider.  While she confesses that the island provides a much-needed solace in which she can process events from her troubled past, she thoughtfully neglects to share her entire backstory with the reader.  We know that part of her residency was for spiritual reasons, and she doesn't overwhelm us with more details than we need to know.  We all have baggage; it's enough to know that Cairn was lucky enough to find a place where she can deal with her own.  Her descriptive prose may get you thinking about visiting Monomoy yourself someday.  At the very least, you'll look at gulls a little differently from now on.	2004-06-16

Over the years, lots of books have been written by city folks who summer in or retire to cabins in rural or remote or beach or otherwise-touristy areas and who feel the need to share their experiences with the rest of us.  &quot;Frankie's Place&quot;now ranks at the top of that genre.<br />This book is not just about two NYC writers who spend extended summers in a cottage on the coast of Maine.  It's about Sterba's own personal lifetime journey, from his Michigan childhood to a career as a newspaperman covering stories in Asian countries.  He's a well-traveled, well-seasoned reporter, and his prose reads like a conversation and his description paints pictures.  Even if your only exposure to the Maine lifestyle has been through stereotyped glimpses of it during &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; reruns, you'll find yourself experiencing it firsthand here.  You'll see and feel the rocky shoreline, the brutally brisk-cold seawater, the drenching damp of a day-long fog, the delight in allowing yourself to be treated to a lobster dinner.  You'll know what it's like to live in a resort area, both before and after the busy season.  And as you read along, the text becomes a subtle but most meaningful lecture on Sense of Place.  You quietly walk toward that goal with Jim and Frankie, and each one of you knows what the final outcome will be.<br />Treat yourself to Sterba's book especially if you're feeling lost in 21st-century civilization.  It will bring you peace, laughter, good food, and light contemplation.	2004-05-23

Beforehand, the only thing I could remember about the Erie Canal was the folk song we learned and sang (a lot, it seemed) in elementary school.  My goodness, there's so much more to know!  Mr. Condon does a marvelous job of chronicling the history of the canal and putting it into the context of the events of the day.  He traces the feat from budding idea to reality, with much of the progress due to the political management of De Witt Clinton.  Of course, it was then up to the local farmers and the immigrant Irishmen to actually dig The Ditch that was to be 40 feet wide and four feet deep, covering 363 miles from Albany to Buffalo.  Here we not only discover the story of the creation of the canal (1817-1825), but also details about the lives of the people associated with it and with the cultures of the individual towns that grew along its towpath.  This volume is an example of a comprehensive history done well.  The writing style allows the reader to join the author in admiring the work of the past while occasionally laughing at the funny side of everyday life, across time.<br />More contemporary and illustrative books like Stark and Marquisee's &quot;Cruising America's Waterways:  The Erie Canal&quot; are great supplements.  But if you start with Condon's book, you'll be able to better appreciate the present-day photos and interpretation.  Since &quot;Stars in the Water&quot; was written, President Clinton named the waterway a National Heritage Corridor, and it's become a recreational resource as well as an historical one.<br />Now if I can just get that darn song out of my head...	2004-05-19

It can also put you into contact with a wide variety of people with a wide variety of interests and/or problems.  Any one of us could write a book about it, and Suzanne has.  She details her duties in her part-time job at an independent bookstore, where she began to work after surviving radiation treatments for cancer.  Here she learns the tricks of the retail trade.  She prepares displays for every holiday on the calendar.  She watches consumer reactions to 9/11.  And she figures out what to tell people who say that they're looking for &quot;something that isn't going to make me think.&quot;  In a way, her employment is as recuperative and as rehabilitating for her as it is to the customers buying from the store's self-help section.<br />But the story isn't just about a bookstore in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Suzanne also traces her own lifetime encounters with books, including those happy childhood days when the community bookmobile would visit her neighborhood.  She tells us about the other bookstores she visits on book signing tours (she's published five other volumes) right down to the Polish pierogies that are served as refreshments.  Here's a woman who's in love with every aspect of the written word and who conveys that emotion to us on every page.<br />Anyone who frequents a library or a bookstore will be able to relate to Susanne's observations.

Kate Whouley shares with us an experience full of excitement, possibility, drama, finance, frustration, spirituality, and above all, friendship and humor.<br />The first task is to figure out how to move a cottage from one town to another.  The second is to take care of the extensive interior work that will unite an existing house to its cottage addition.  Woven in and around it all are the plans and official paperwork that must be filed with the proper authorities.  Though the originally simple thought of attaching the two structures becomes more complicated as the weeks go by, the author has a support staff of friends and local artisans who keep her spirits high and keep making construction progress.  And of course the whole operation is supervised by Egypt, the resident cat-in-charge.  The eight pages of b&amp;w photos barely cover all the stages of the project, but Whouley's descriptive prose more than makes up for the lack of additional visuals.  By the last page, you know her home almost as well as she does.<br />A fun and fast book to read, even if you don't know your flathead from a Phillips, and especially if you're thinking of enlarging your own home.

Ricketson	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Who are these guys?  Why should we care about them?	The short answer is that these men were passionate Thoreau &quot;enthusiasts&quot; from varying backgrounds who had a common goal:  to promote in positive fashion the life and work of Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862).  This selection shows the web of correspondence that took place from 1889-1907.  Unveiled is the beginning of true research into the naturalist's life, work, friends, and reputation, with contributions from both academic and non-academic standpoints.  These jottings are not just personal letters: they also contain primary-source explanations about people, publications, events, and lifestyle details.  Today's astute reader/researcher can watch now-accepted facts gradually come to the surface.  The participants even had a sense of their spot in literary history.  As Dr. Jones wrote to Fred Hosmer in 1892:  &quot;I do not believe that Thoreau ever dreamed that such an amount of writing would be done about him.&quot; ... &quot;All these little things are going to have an importance when the people who can give information are dead, and we who are the link between Thoreau's days and the future should attend to them.&quot;<br />The group represents diversity in a century before that term became popular.  Dr. Samuel Arthur Jones was a homoeopathic physician in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Alfred &quot;Fred&quot; Winslow Hosmer was an amateur photographer from Concord. Henry S. Salt was a former British schoolmaster turned socialist and reformer.  The quintet was completed with two of Thoreau's friends:  Harrison Gray Otis Blake of Worcester, and Daniel Ricketson of New Bedford.  Each man had his own focus and contributed uniquely to the knowledge of the rest.  Together they debated and uncovered answers to what they thought were the most burning Thoreau questions of the day.  What were his parents *really* like? Who was the woman that both Henry and his brother John loved?  Was the Walden cabin used as an Underground Railroad stop?  Who paid the tax to get him out of jail?  Who owned the copyright to his work?  How many photos and daguerrotypes were taken of Thoreau during his lifetime?  When and where were these taken, and who had copies?  We witness their problem-solving techniques, thought processes and conclusions as each piece fits into the great Thoreau puzzle.<br />But it's not all seriousness here.  Here and there we read the exclamations of these distinguished 19th-century gentlemen, cooing over shared copies of publications and pictures with as much giddiness and glee as 21st-century schoolgirls over glossy pop star magazines.  Imagine, exchanging copies of articles and pictures in the days before photocopiers!  These men kept their pens and their postmen busy.  And they weren't above gossip, either.  They weren't afraid to launch disparaging or scathing remarks at anyone who didn't hold Henry in the highest esteem or who may have misrepresented a single detail about him.  They questioned the sincerity of Dr. Edward Emerson (sarcastically referred to as &quot;the son of his father&quot;) and the accuracy of the biographical writings of Franklin B. Sanborn, Ellery Channing, and Dr. A. H. Japp.  Sometimes they doubted even each other's motives without real cause.  Jones and Salt produced their own Thoreau works, the first writers outside Concord community or the inner circle of Transcendentalists to do so.  Hosmer took photos of Walden Pond and its environs to supplement the reprinting of Thoreau's writings.  Blake published seasonal excerpts from the Journal.  We get insight into the creation of their own publications and the reactions of the others to them.<br />A reader with scant regard for Thoreau will find this book boring, confusing, or unnecessary.  But it's absolute fun for Thoreau devotees, who will laugh out loud at some of the statements and realize that contemporary versions of these characters exist today.  And it's apt to give diehard Thoreauvians a list of &quot;new&quot; publications to track down and digest in their original form.digest in their original form.	2004-04-08

He says, &quot;If I'm driving down the road, I don't care if I pass a yellow house with a white picket fence and a dog tied up in the yard.  I just want to get to where I'm going.&quot;  While I've shaken my head at his chauvinistic view, it has caused me to pay more attention to differences in writing styles.  Maybe the variety is somewhat gender-based, maybe it isn't.<br />&quot;Whisker of Evil&quot; includes a lot of detail that doesn't always seem to &quot;get us where we're going.&quot;  The murder on the first page demands our immediate attention.  And those of us who are fans of this series will enjoy watching Harry, Fair, Susan, Miranda, Cooper, Rich, all the animals and the elite of the Crozet equine community figure out what's going on in their neighborhood.  But there are multiple instances when the action is stalled by extraneous explanation and back story.  It happens often enough that I took notice and wondered how much of the information I'd have to recall down the line.  Having faith in the author, I continued on.  If not for that, I could easily have abandoned the book and gone on to something else.  Maybe I've been reading too many male authors and/or quicker and shorter mysteries lately!  Or maybe my reading tastes are changing.<br />I've read many of Brown's books with pleasure.  I love her technique of sharing the animals' communications through the use of italics.  This is the first Mrs. Murphy Mystery that was slow for me.  It won't stop me from reading her future work, for I especially want to know what ensues from the recent changes in Harry's life.  My advice is to pick up this volume knowing that there's A LOT going on in it.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that...)	2004-04-05

The Elm Creek Quilters have decided to secretly craft a special quilt to honor their hostess and leader.  They've asked each one of Sylvia's friends and former campers to stitch a patchwork block that somehow celebrates her inspiration to others.  The contributions will be pieced together and presented as a belated wedding present to Sylvia and her new husband, Andrew.  This book would be interesting enough if it merely reproduced all of the resulting letters with their stories and creative choices.  But no:  the local women have lives too, and they can be just as complex and frustrating as our own.  Their own dramas wrap around the central theme in the same way that the incoming squares reveal portions of Sylvia's life.  And they're told in block fashion as well, with each chapter focusing on one individual until the finale is devoted to the Master Quilter herself.  While newbies to this series might be overwhelmed by the number of characters involved, they shouldn't let that bog down their reading.  They've got plenty of time to catch up on the previous installments later, and then &quot;the whole story&quot; will be understood.	2004-03-31

This picture book combines the act of counting with cat facts; in particular, it's about calico cats colored orange and black and white.  The narrator is a mouse named Willy Whiskers, though he fades away from the focus as the pages turn.  What's remarkable here is Tildes' artwork.  These cats are so furry, you almost expect to be able to pet them.  For children, especially those with a new pet ... but quite suitable for cat lovers of all ages.	2004-02-18

She begins her text with the Thoreau quote that \\"We need the tonic of wildness. ... We can never have enough of nature.\\"  The real-life vignettes that follow illustrate the healing / spiritual power that nature has had on individuals of varying ages with special mental or physical challenges.  We see how connections are made between the human spirit and Nature -- in the form of dogs, rabbits, moss, seaweed, even buckets of ocean water.  The sight, smell and touch of cattails, grasses, marsh ice, and rabbit fur can console and heal.  They can stimulate communication where none previously existed and unearth personal histories that were previously buried and unknown to caretakers.  Reynolds' storytelling style makes it easy to witness these encounters in person.  Readers can feel the starkness of a typical hospital room made temporarily more livable by bringing Nature inside.  Inspirational reading for environmental educators, pet therapists, animal lovers, and those feeling a bit disconnected or locked behind four walls themselves.	2004-02-18

Dixon	Chelsea House's \\"Who Wrote That?\\" biography series features the lives of authors familiar to young adults.  They won't recognize the name Edward Stratemeyer right off the bat, though.  He began as a writer in his own right and gradually became the driving force behind the publication of a myriad of mystery series aimed at teenagers in the early 1900s.  Among his most popular character-creations were the Rover Boys, Tom Swift, the Bobbsey Twins, the Hardy Boys, and Nancy Drew.  While he outlined the plots, a variety of individuals in his \\"Stratemeyer Snydicate\\" actually penned the texts.<br />Not much is known about Stratemeyer's personal life, so a large portion of this volume is spent in focus on the series books themselves.  Lange includes quotes from some of the \\"real\\" authors who had initially agreed to Stratemeyer's silent ghostwriter rule.  She also summarizes research about the series' popularity over the years and how they were the right publications for the right audience at the right time.  For example, the fictional depiction of independent young females like Nancy Drew gave credence to the real-life feminism of the day.<br />Diehard fans of all ages may find it disconcerting to learn that no Carolyn Keene or Franklin W. Dixon exist.  While that knowledge might take away some of the magic and appeal of the titles, it also serves as proof of the success of such a publishing endeavor.  Equally disturbing may be the fact that our heroes are all pretty old:  Frank and Joe Hardy and Nancy Drew first showed up in print in the 1930s, and the Bobbsey Twins appeared in 1904!  And yet they endure and remain among the classics of children's literature.	2004-02-14

While she &quot;works&quot; as a waitress in the Ahwahnne Hotel restaurant, she keeps her eyes open, asks questions, and noses around a bit.  After she takes a long hike and finds a secret lurking in a remote area of the park, the action takes off and this book is difficult to put down.  (Turns out the elevation isn't the only thing in the park that's &quot;high.&quot;)  Anna ends up finding some rather nasty folks in the midst of the spectacular glacial scenery. Thank goodness she's a trained and capable law enforcement officer and outdoors-person.  A lesser woman wouldn't make it past page 155!

Henry David Thoreau spent time living in the Emerson house and was the substitute head of the household several times when Edward's father was out of town.  He entertained the children and was remembered fondly by the young people of Concord.  Here Edward includes those memories with his own and with excerpts from Thoreau's journal.<br /><br />While these facts and quotes are valid, they don't paint a complete biography of the man.  Some of the incidents make sense only to the savvy reader who already has a Thoreauvian background.  And only the first 50 pages are text; the remaining 30 consist of expansive footnotes.  If you want to glean the full story, you'll have to constantly page back and forth. Yes, it's a worthwhile view that comes from a friend, but it's not the best or most detailed chronicle.  An optional read.	2004-01-31

But Louise Dickinson and Ralph Rich lived together in a remote region of Maine for only ten years.  What else did Louise do?  This book tells us:  she wrote.  Through personal interviews with her children and close friends, the details of Louise Dickinson's life are presented.  Included are the original texts of letters, journal notes, and diary entries, even though the latter make for somewhat tedious and clipped reading.  The second half of the book rewards us with further selected writings from Louise.  She lived in a variety of places in both Massachusetts and Maine, and she had a wide circle of friends.  Her experiences turned her into a quintessential describer of New England life, whether she was writing for adults or, later on, for children.  This is the story of a writer who put in her time and eventually gained fame but not fortune.  Of interest to naturalists as well as struggling authors.	2003-11-17

Posthumous biographies helped to draw attention to his life in Concord and thus to his writings.  These books can be shelved into four categories:<br />(1) His journals themselves, in addition to his books and essays, provide the closest primary information.  Chronologically though, they should be ranked third because they were made available to the public more than 40 years after his death when they were first printed in 1906.<br />(2) A few friends and acquaintances released book-length biographies based on their personal relationships with the man.  William Ellery Channing's _Thoreau: the poet-naturalist_ (1873) and Frank B. Sanborn's _American Men of Letters: Henry D. Thoreau_ (1882) are the classics.<br />(3)  Men who were inspired by Thoreau's writings began to correspond with his Concord friends in order to learn more and to write their own books.  Examples include the 1890 publications of Henry S. Salt's _Life of Henry David Thoreau_ and Samuel Arthur Jones's _Thoreau: A Glimpse_.<br />(4) Everyone who came afterward had to rely on interpretation of all of the writings and letters from those previous categories.  The most famous remain Henry Seidel Canby (_Thoreau_, 1939) and Walter Harding (_The Days of Henry Thoreau: A Biography_, 1962).<br />Englishman Henry S. Salt (1851-1939) published his first Thoreau biography in 1890, and released a revision in 1896.  Neither one sold well.  By 1908, he was looking for a publisher to print a third and more complete edition.  While he spent the rest of his life in that search, his efforts were to no avail.  But he sent a copy of all of his material to Professor Raymond Adams of the University of North Carolina, in the hopes that the professor would be able to use it for publication.  Dr. Adams was too daunted when Henry Canby's book was released in 1939, and so Henry Salt's notes were archived with his own.  That is, until they were found and reprinted here.  The result is the best revision of Salt's meticulous research and correspondence, augmented by minor corrections made by the 20th-century compilers.<br />Salt was a genuine Thoreau disciple, and so this biography paints a positive picture of the man.  It's probably my second favorite, with Canby's being first.  There may still be a few small errors that weren't fixed.  (Thoreau's companion on the Minnesota trip was Horace Mann *Jr.*, a title needed to distinguish him from his more famous father.)  Overall, though, this book is a welcome addition to the ranks, and we are lucky that the editors found the manuscript, prepared it, and shared it with the rest of us.e found and reprinted here.

He screamed at and somehow motivated nearly every male in the county to don a green and white Spartan jersey, to push forward, to win and never fail.  His record was 418-62.  His teams won 13 state titles.  And a nearly perfect coaching career was marred by two events -- one that divided the town, and another that was so secretive it still generated gossip and speculation 15 years later.<br />Now the Coach is on his deathbed, and his former players have migrated back to The Field to hold vigil.  They come from all walks of life.  Some of them never left Messina.  Some have found success in a profession, and others haven't.  All share the common bond of playing under Coach Rake.  Theirs is a football fraternity that spans years and hundreds of teammates.<br />Neely Crenshaw was a quarterback on one of the championship squads of the 1980s.  He's remembered by most locals as Messina's only All-American ... and the one whose playing career was cut short by a side tackle during his second year in college.  We follow Neely as he returns to his hometown with apprehension but a sense of duty.  He's still not sure if he hates Eddie Rake or loves him.  It seems his old teammates feel the same way.<br />Grisham's technique is stellar.  Just four chapters are needed to fill in the backstory and to get the audience ready for the obvious conclusion, and each chapter connects to the book title.  He issues respect by capitalizing the noun \\"Coach\\" even when it's not followed by a personal name.  For although Coach Rake never appears in person on the page, he is indeed the subject of the story.  The writing is so real that at times you can touch the green crest of the manicured turf, and you can feel a cold aluminum plank under your seat.  The most emotional scene of all comes 20 pages before the back cover, and yet we cannot stop reading.  It's almost like being in Canton on Induction Weekend. [I've been there twice.]<br />Critics might say these characters are stereotypical.  Coach Rake is like the Woody Hayes, the Bear Bryants, and the Lou Holtzes of the game.  Clones of Neely Crenshaw and Jesse Trapp, the kids who should \\"make it big,\\" can be found on teams at every playing level.  But stereotypes always reflect some truth, and every small town has its own equivalents of the men we meet in this book.  That's why we'll all nod and say, \\"Yup, that's just like -----\\" when we're finished with _Bleachers_.  It inspires us to think of our own former teachers, coaches, and classmates.

But intertwined with those times and those people were others who were washed with the same spirit of the place.  While the Hoar family was distinguished and well-known within Concord society, its members remain historically shadowed by such friends as Daniel Webster, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, James Russell Lowell, and Margaret Fuller.  This book serves to remedy any past omissions.  Thus is _The Royal Family of Concord_ not a chronicle of a town; yet we have no choice but to absorb Concordian history and culture.  The text is not an Emerson biography; yet we are given the opportunity to read his personal letters and hear the man's voice in each chapter.  No, this is the tale of an American family who, generation after generation, was in the right place at the right time to witness and participate in the most memorable issues and events of the 19th century.<br />Though the extended Hoar clan contains many notable individuals, cousins and in-laws, three main characters emerge here.  Samuel &quot;Squire&quot; Hoar, Jr. (1778-1856) was a lawyer and statesman at the state and federal level.  In Concord, he was THE conservative authority figure who knew the Constitution and the American legal system inside and out.  His daughter Elizabeth Sherman Hoar (1814-1878) was a smart and caring woman whose friendship with the Emersons led her to become engaged to Ralph's brother, Charles.  He became ill and died before the two could be married, and Elizabeth vowed to remain true to him.  Her decision freed her to devote time to countless friends and relatives, who saw her as an intellectual equal and a caretaker when needed.  Ebenezer Rockwood &quot;Judge&quot; Hoar (1816-1895) followed in his father's legal shoes and became a lawyer and a judge.  He served as U.S. Attorney General during Ulysses S. Grant's presidency and was continually involved in politics at both the state and federal levels.<br />Another Hoar son, Edward, was a friend and companion to Henry David Thoreau.  In fact, it was Edward who was with Henry when they accidentally set fire to the local woodlot, thus raising the ire of the Concord community.  Author Robbins makes an assumption about Thoreau's personal relationships:  one that is arguable and objectionable to most Thoreauvians (this one included).  But the focus here is on the Hoars, and this minor slight to Henry is remedied in other scholarly works.<br />_The Royal Family of Concord_ is a detailed but readable chronicle that serves as a sample of upper class life in the 1800s.  Above all, Elizabeth Sherman Hoar emerges as the pure heroic pebble cast into a sea of lawyers and politicians.. Attorney General during Ulysses S.

We become familiar with bits and pieces of Nevada Barr's past, but only as they apply to her personal maturing process and evolving spirituality.  She presents and discusses religious tenets, but not in the new-age fadlike fashion of _Conversations with God_ by Neale Donald Walsch or _Celestine Prophecy_ by James Redfield.  And she's someone famous, someone we already \\"know\\" -- but not an author we'd expect to hear such talk from.  Therein lies the charm of _Seeking Enlightenment_.<br />In short and easy subject-based chapters, Barr reveals her basic philosophies of life.  Readers can decide whether or not they agree with her conclusions.  There's no pressure here...except perhaps for the chapter called \\"Do animals have souls?\\", which begins with the succinct first paragraph: \\"Of course they do.  Don't be an idiot.\\"  (Hear! hear!)  I found myself smiling at and re-reading some passages and later hurrying over others. Sometimes the stories sounded so close to the experiences of friends that I made a mental note to share this book with those folks after I'm finished with it.  Or better yet, I'll buy and distribute copies as gifts.<br />Some fans will pick this book up because of the author's name and will leave most of it unread when they realize it's not another Anna Pigeon mystery.  The more curious ones will continue on with an eye to compare Nevada's background, beliefs, and behaviors with Anna's.  They'll nod in satisfaction when some of Anna's history does indeed show up in Nevada's own life.  Still others will savor these casual observations enough to sit down and think about their own philosophies.  If a busy mystery writer can take the time to contemplate Life, why can't we?	2003-07-30

The ragtag group made up of Stuart, Hollis, Beth and Rachel takes the assignment to heart.  They each sign a \\"Henry Contract.\\"  And before you know it, they've somehow constructed a cabin in nearby Wayburn Woods.  Each member of the group eventually finds a niche -- one that didn't exist before, and one that highlights heretofore unseen talents.  Thus do these \\"invisible\\" personalities become known to the rest of the school.  By the time Wayburn Woods is threatened by a housing development, the place has become familiar to a wider range of students and community members.  We can only speculate about what the future holds for our characters and their hometown.<br />Robin Vaupel has crafted a wonderful YA novel that's sure to turn young people on to Henry David Thoreau.  His words and philosophies are peppered throughout the plot, and each chapter begins with an inspirational quote.  [I'll forgive a small error:  \\"In WILDNESS is the preservation of the world,\\" not \\"in wilderness.\\"  That's a common mistake that even finds itself painted onto the walls of nature centers.]  The story unfolds from Beth's viewpoint, and I found myself wishing I could be fourteen again and could be Beth.  My experience in high school libraries convinces me that teenagers of both genders will find this book a worthy read.  The most environment-oriented among them may use it as motivation to see and save their own special places.  The world could use such inspiration!	2003-07-21

But while the famous Transcendentalist took copious notes from his readings and often cited his sources, he didn't leave us a definitive chronicle of titles to study.  Why would he?  And why would we even want to consult such a thing today?  Because of his frequent use of literary allusions in his writings, especially in the two books published during his lifetime, _A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers_ and _Walden_.  Because, too, he was a man who was often affected and impassioned by the words that passed before his eyes.  Dr. Sattelmeyer has done a great job finding clues not only within Thoreau's writings themselves but also through extant library records held in Concord and Cambridge.  The resulting prepared list takes up only two-thirds of this book, though.  The four chapters at the beginning help to make sense of it all.  They pose Thoreau's choice of reading material and his subsequent reactions against the perspective of life and events of the mid-1800s.  The explanation of the changes occurring in natural history philosophies and theories --  culminating in the release of Charles Darwin's _Origin of Species_ -- is especially enlightening.  Thus does the introductory text make this volume useful to anyone with a moderate Thoreau and / or 19th-century interest, and it dispels any first impression that this title focuses on an esoteric subject matter.  If you enjoy reading _Walden_ and are interested in Thoreau's life and the prevailing thought of his day, seek out a copy of this book.	2003-07-07

But many of these essays describe creatures and natural phenomena that take place in other locales as well -- it's just that we're too busy or too apathetic to observe them.  He sees.  And then he tells us about his encounters, just as easily as if we're sitting across the table from him at a casual eatery.<br /><br />My favorite passage is beach-oriented and describes a old cottage being overcome by natural forces:  &quot;Sand sifts slowly, like age, over everything, softening, obscuring, and finally obliterating each distinct thing into a semblance of itself and the next thing.  In this sense, sand is the ultimate progressive poet, whispering, 'This chair is like this table, is like this bed, is like this sink -- and each thing is, more and more, like all the others, until finally they are all -- like me'.&quot; (p. 153)  Of course!  Why didn't any of the rest of us think to say or write that?<br /><br />Save this volume for a time in your life when you need the peace of Nature to drape itself over you and slow down your blood pressure.

Though they've collaborated informally to solve murders in the past, the couple now works part-time after school hours in a private investigation firm.  After all, poorly-paid private school teachers and beginning graduate students have to watch their pennies, and additional income helps.<br />Enter Claire Fairchild, an elderly woman who hires them to do a background check on her daughter-in-law-to-be, Emmie Cade.  Amanda and C.K. easily uncover a number of sordid details from Emmie's dubious past.  When they stop by Claire's condo to drop off the information (and hopefully get paid for their work), they discover that their client has died, presumably from a heart attack.  But what really happened?  And was Emmie involved?  While Amanda wants to sort it all out -- against C.K.'s better judgment -- she's simultaneously bombarded with visits from her future in-laws and her own Florida-based parents, and everyone's pressuring the two to set a wedding date and get on with marriage plans.  And it's the first week of school, for heaven's sakes; Amanda's also dealing with adolescent angst and _The Lord of the Flies_ to boot.  How many balls can she juggle?

The curtain call of each chapter is a recipe from Roberts' own files, a technique which has the effect of not only sharing a part of herself but also tying her even closer to her onscreen character.  And who knows?  Maybe she'll start a fad of throwing holiday Greed Parties!  A natural sequel to Patricia Heaton's _Motherhood and Hollywood_.  _Raymond_ fans will not be disappointed.	2003-05-11

For _My Friend, My Friend_ serves as a good overall biography of both Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson and describes in understandable terms the transcendental movement as well.  The added focus is what each man thought of friendship in general and how it pertained to his relationship with the other.  Newbies to the works and lives of these two men would do well to start their education with this volume.  Ardent fans of either writer will find they disagree with some of the author's suppositions, though, especially in the discussion of how the men's real lives differed with the public personas they each created.  Even so, it's an engaging read.	2003-05-11

I like Margaret Barlow, the protagonist and Jessica-Fletcher-like widow who's trying to figure out exactly what is happening on her island home.  The plot was intricate enough that I couldn't identify the &quot;villain&quot; until just before the climax, and that's the mark of a good mystery.

US	52987415	REGZPZHG8BL7H	0870232312	515494006	Young Man Thoreau	Books	3	3	4	N	N	More about Thoreau than one might want to know	There are biographies of Henry David Thoreau, and there are literary criticisms about Walden and his other works.  _Young Man Thoreau_ is closer to the former than the latter.  It's a psychological analysis of his early pre-Walden life based on his own writings, records of his life, and remarks made by his contemporaries.  Those insights are juxtaposed against Freud's theories and Erik Erikson's life-cycle model of human behavior.  And the verdict is that Thoreau experienced a prolonged adolescence with a psychosocial moratorium that delayed the burden of adult responsibilities.  His eternal search for a \\"great man\\" can be traced to his own family situation, which featured a weak father figure and a domineering mother, so of course the author brings Oedipus into the picture.  Further discussion is held about the triangular relationship between Henry, his brother John, and their friend Ellen Sewall, who turned down both brothers' offers of marriage.  Henry's reactions to his own accidental fire-setting to the Concord woods and the early death of his brother are also put under the figurative microscope.  The result is probably as accurate an examination as we can get, given that the actual man is not here to defend himself or confirm the diagnosis.<br />And yet the fact remains that he *is* not present.  So how can we tell if this analysis, though well researched, is the truth?  If you have your own comfortable ideas about Henry David Thoreau, you probably would do well to steer clear of this book.  Or read it with a discerning eye, knowing that you'll be shaking your head at some of the suppositions offered.  Interesting but not essential.	2003-04-25

Anthony &amp; Elizabeth Cady Stanton get more press...	...but they and the entire women's rights movement owe a great deal to Lucy Stone (1818-1893).  This extensive biography profiles the woman who makes her way from a farm in central Massachusetts to Oberlin College (the only institution admitting women and blacks at the time), and then on to the lecture circuit and the issues of anti-slavery and suffrage.  A fiercely-independent woman who vows never to marry, she fends off and is simultaneously intrigued by romantic advances made to her by Henry Blackwell, the Ralph Kramden of his day.  They marry in 1855.  Lucy continues her speaking tours, eventually takes care of daughter Alice, publishes the Women's Journal, and finances all of Henry's ill-fated get-rich-quick schemes.  Intertwined with the details of her personal life are her relationships with the key people in both movements (Anthony, Stanton, Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison) and the splits with leaders of both.  Thanks to many pieces of archived correspondence, we can know the reasons for the rift among suffrage leaders, the division into separate organizations, and their reunion many years later.  A fascinating must-read for feminists of all dimensions.	2003-03-31

Lilly Armbruster is angry, and for good reason.  The twenty-year-old woman has lost both parents; the family farm has been sold, and her older brother has gambled away all the profit.  The once-peaceful farm community of East Chelmsford, Massachusetts, has been transformed into an industrial town named Lowell.  And Lilly has no choice but to find a room in a boardinghouse and join the throng of girls who work long hours in the mill.  Worse yet, her former beau Matthew Cheever, a former farm boy himself, has handily switched allegiances and is now an executive for the Associates.  Lilly is so full of disdain that she plots to somehow put a stop to the mill and to hate Matthew forever.  Inner conflict arises when she tries to find answers in the Bible.  After all, couldn't it be God's intention for her to sabotage the mill works?  A captivating insight into the time period, this first episode of the &quot;Bells of Lowell&quot; series should prove of interest to fans of historical novels as well as to those who read Christian fiction.	2003-03-08

You might see the title of this book and say, &quot;Oh, OK, he was the guy who thought up the idea for a footpath from Maine to Georgia.  Big deal.  I've never stepped on it, so why should I care about him?&quot;  Well, without Benton MacKaye, we probably wouldn't have the Trail.  We might not have a Wilderness Society, the Wilderness Act of 1964, the National Trail Systems Act of 1968, or the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.  We might not have Shenandoah National Park in Virginia or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park straddling the Tennessee-North Carolina border.  We could instead have just interstate highways crowning the entire length of the eastern mountain range.  We could conceivably have uninterrupted suburbia from the Atlantic coastline to the Midwest, with little consideration given to the mountains or any natural area in between.  Benton MacKaye might very well be one of the most influential 20th-century American environmentalists you've never heard of.<br />A New Englander with a Harvard graduate degree in forestry, MacKaye spent most of his professional life taking a variety of short-term government or association jobs that dealt with conservation issues.  Eventually he carved a niche for himself as an outspoken regional planner.  He was adept at writing articles and proposing legislation that included catchy words or concepts:  geotechnics, new exploration, townless highways, highwayless towns, watershed democracies, wildland belts, and habitability.  For MacKaye was at heart a boy who loved to wander through the natural landscape of central Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont.  In the early 1900s, he was already worried about increasing numbers of motorists invading those wild spaces, particularly into the region's mountainous areas.  He spent the majority of his life fighting to keep those places &quot;sound-proof as well as sight-proof&quot; from the intrusion of contemporary civilization.  In some ways, he was the Thoreau of his day.<br />The formal publication of &quot;The Appalachian Trail:  A Project in Regional Planning&quot; (included here as an appendix) came to fruition in 1921, and it laid the foundation for the rest of his articles and essays.  We who consider ourselves environmentalists today find his words still striking an inner chord.  MacKaye wrote in the 1950s:  &quot;Verily, the first and simplest rule on earth:  Give back to the earth that which we take from her.  Return the good we have borrowed; in short, pay our ecological bills.  Pay them in dirt, not dollars.  It's the only currency the good earth accepts.  Too long have we lived on dollar ecology.&quot;  (p. 336)  Yes, Mr. MacKaye, yes.  Let's shout that one from the mountaintops, if we can still find them.<br />Anderson is admirably neutral in presenting the facts and interpreting MacKaye's connections with and influences on more &quot;famous&quot; individuals like Lewis Mumford, Aldo Leopold, Bob Marshall, and Olaus Murie.  That must have been a tough job indeed, since the author obviously spent a huge amount of time with his subject.  The resulting details are valuable to have compiled into one volume but might limit readership to scholars of the AT or of the environmental movement.  With every turn of a page, though, his chronicle of MacKaye's endeavors brings home a basic truth that still holds today:  that every environmental debate is a political one.

But a part of it stayed with me, and I found myself thinking about it and occasionally sharing it with others.  So when I saw another copy of this volume in a used bookstore, I scooped it up for myself.  I stood there and thumbed through the pages until I found it -- Chapter 10, &quot;Flying Squirrels: Phantoms of the Night,&quot; the story of a young flying squirrel named Hepsey.  John Terres had the opportunity to keep Hepsey almost like a pet for most of her life.  While that kind of arrangement is generally not a good one for human or for wild creature (and would easily have been fodder for a 1960s Disney film), Terres learned quite a bit about squirrels that a more formal study might not have revealed.  He wondered about her nut-hiding talent, for example.  So he put 100 hickory nuts out on a table and left the house.  When he came back, each nut was hidden somewhere -- in a shirt pocket, in a shoe, etc.  He put another 100 nuts out that same night, and they disappeared as well.  Based on Hepsey's behavior, Terres projected that a typical squirrel could probably store 10,000-12,000 nuts in one winter season.  A fascinating tidbit of information like that sticks in your head.  But the fun of it all is in his narration of the escapade and of other Hepsey happenings.  That chapter is arresting enough to warrant reading aloud during a nature center program.<br /><br />Terres' ruminations and nature observations are based on his rambles through the North Carolina landscape.  &quot;How Vultures Find Their Prey&quot; is another interesting test (by sight or by smell?) that you will remember.  But it's Hepsey who will capture your imagination.	2003-02-24

Henry David Thoreau wrote in 1850 about \\"a sweet wild world which lives along the strain of the wood thrush,\\" and here William White reveals glimpses of that realm through selected journal entries arranged by season.  White rightly asserts that the transcendentalist's formal poems are clumsy concoctions and are less than memorable, but his prose -- especially portions of his journal -- contains a poetic quality worthy of transcribing into free verse form.  Hence, this volume.  Individual excerpts appear on separate pages and are enhanced with 16 seasonal pen-and-ink illustrations by Georgia Dearborn.  A tasteful gift idea for nature lovers, and certainly less expensive than one of the innumerable coffee table books with full-color photos accompanied by random quotes.	2003-02-24

She possesses a wry wit, a caustic tongue, and a mind for metaphor.  Yet she's not above allowing her thoughts to dwell on people doing \\"the horizontal hootchy-kootchy\\" or \\"the mattress mambo.\\"  She knows her Bible and the commandments through and through, but she's got enough common sense to know when circumstances demand that the rules be bent a little.  That's always the case whenever she stumbles upon a murder and feels the need to find the perpetrator.<br /><br />In this episode, millionaire Colonel George Custard comes to the PennDutch Inn in his limo, accompanied by two servants.  The bad news is, he has plans to build a huge hotel that will destroy small-town Hernia's ambiance.  The good news is, he's soon murdered, and Magdalena leads the investigation.  She *has* to, doesn't she?  The local law officials -- her dim-witted brother-in-law and his Tammy-Fay-Mimi-Bobeck-clone sidekick -- are clueless and useless.  And they're just two of the many unique characters that pepper this community.<br /><br />I wouldn't want to meet Magdalena Yoder in person.

And why should we read them?	Dr. Samuel A. Jones (1834-1912) was a physician and Thoreau scholar who lived in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Horace Hosmer (1830-1894) was a small businessman in Acton and Concord, Massachusetts.  They formed a friendship when their paths crossed in 1890, and they exchanged letters from that point on until Horace's death in 1894.  Much of their correspondence dealt with the then-contemporary image of Henry David Thoreau, who had been popularized in an 1888 biography by F. B. Sanborn.  Dr. Jones was a devoted fan of the naturalist; Horace was a family friend who had once been a student in Henry and John Thoreau's school.  Both set out to refute details revealed in the Sanborn book.<br /><br />Enter George Hendrick, an English professor who in 1974 discovered this collection of Horace's letters in the attic of Dr. Jones' daughter-in-law.  While the doctor's replies have not survived, Horace's side of the conversation is revealing enough, and we can fill in the blanks.  We get a general idea of what life was like in Concord in the 1890s, especially regarding politics.  And we learn a great deal about the personal life of Horace Hosmer, of course.  He gives specifics about his own health condition, which seems natural enough because he was speaking with a doctor.  He talks about his own pencil-making business and compares it to the Thoreau family operation.  He dispels rumors that Henry's cabin was a stop on the Underground Railroad.  He glows with respect for Henry's brother John and for their parents, John and Cynthia.  Just as we come to know and nearly understand this common man, we read a final letter from his daughter, who writes to Dr. Jones the day after her father died.<br /><br />An informal but revealing and sometimes amusing glimpse of life at a certain time, in a certain place.	2003-02-19

You realize that the look of leather on the cover is just that, a look.  You flip through the pages and find a scrapbook, complete with worn and mildewed pages, enhanced with token mementos that look so three-dimensional you must trace them with a tentative finger.  A letter from Thomas Gage to Lieutenant Colonel Smith is tucked inside the front cover; the Deposition of Paul Revere is stuck in the back.  We find a map of the British plan and a corresponding map of the Middlesex Alarm, including Revere's actual route.  This is *not* just a casual recitation of the classic poem.  The words proceed on faded sheets while Bing's illustrations hint at period woodcuts.  No explanations are necessary within the text. Notes are saved for the end, and they reveal the minor inaccuracies in the Longfellow version (one of the biggest being that Paul Revere was captured outside of Lexington and that his companion Dr. Samuel Prescott was the one who made it all the way to Concord).

This 18-mile-long reservoir was created in the late 1930s and early 1940s when the Swift River Valley in western Mass. was deliberately flooded.  The goal of the project was to provide water to Boston and to other selected cities in the commonwealth, which the reservoir still does today.  Four towns were lost in the process, however, and a certain historical mystique still surrounds those communities.  Here journalist-naturalist Michael Tougias takes us on a tour of the region with stories and scenes from yesterday and today.  We learn of the history of the region, the activities of the Metropolitan District Water Supply Commission, who the \\"woodpeckers\\" were, and the displacement of residents of Prescott, Enfield, Greenwich, and Dana.  Quabbin's magic continues in its gradual acceptance and promotion as a natural resource and recreational area.  Today a bald eagle may fly over you as you proceed along a hiking trail or traverse the length of Winsor Dam.  At the water's edge, you might startle a feeding moose or hear a loon call to its mate.  Take Tougias' book along, and you'll know which of the 55 gates you'll want to use and what you'll see when you get there.  Neighboring towns offer unique diversions as well, and the author provides lists and notes for wanderers exploring the area on foot, on bicycle, or by car.  Quabbin's beauty can be breathtaking; reading and consulting this book will further your appreciation of the place.  A must-buy for New England libraries and for any weekend adventurer.	2003-02-06

He attends the local school and he helps out in his uncle's general store.  He also meets and is mesmerized by resident Henry David Thoreau.  Joel goes on walks with the naturalist, and he practices Latin lessons with the Harvard graduate.  As a result, his stay in Concord turns out to be much better than he had anticipated.<br /><br />Thoreauvians and general historians may cringe at the number of factual inaccuracies in this work of fiction.  But _The Wayfarer's Tree_ isn't the kind of book that most young people pick up these days.  If one of them does, and reads and enjoys it and wants to learn more about Thoreau, then the effort is worthwhile and the errors relatively harmless.	2002-12-25

The trouble is, the Hollands have been separated for almost a year and now have been asked to work together undercover as the married housekeeper and butler. And the other trouble is, no one knows how seriously the recent threats against the President's mother should be taken.  So with a feisty senior citizen under their eagle eyes, the Hollands try to make the best of the personal situation:  individually wondering about the future of their relationship and simultaneously taking part in drop-of-a-hat domestic squabbles.  The way these two go at each other's throats (and hearts) is reminiscent of Ed Stevens and Carol Vessey, seen Wednesday nights on NBC.  We think they really do love each other, but even they are not so sure.<br /><br /> McBride's use of varied third person narrative lets us alternate into the minds of Angela, Bobby, and even presidential matriarch Daisy Riordan.  This technique accelerates the action and builds the tension so much so that on page 324 of this 358-page book, the reader figures out the truth at the same moment Bobby Holland does.  \\"And then it hit him.

And yet -- how much do you know about the man?  Other than admiring magazine covers and once visiting the museum in Stockbridge, Mass., I didn't know any of the particulars of Rockwell's life before I picked this book up at a local library sale.  What a find!  Author Donald Walton is probably a biased source because of his friendship and professional relationship with the man, so we encounter very few negatives and many positive insights into the persona of Norman Rockwell.  The reader's conclusion will be that this was a man who knew early on what he wanted to do in life.  He accomplished it, he saw the world, he took on the projects that most captivated his creativity, and above all, he enjoyed life to its fullest.  He was a celebrity with thousands of admirers and followers, many of them celebrities themselves.  We all should be so lucky.  The chronological text moves smoothly and is firmly supplemented with hundreds of b&amp;w photos.  A &quot;feel-good&quot; biography when you need one.	2002-12-15

Why they don't include some of the essays of Margaret Fuller is a mystery, especially in our current age of political correctness and emphasis on diversity. She provides a woman's opinion of life in general and of the landscape and people of the Midwest in particular in this, her first published book.<br /><br />_Summer on the Lakes, in 1843_ is first and foremost a travelogue of Fuller's tour of the Midwest, and we follow her to Chicago and Milwaukee and into rural Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. Her trip not only predates her friends' visits to the same area (Emerson first came through by stagecoach in 1850, and Thoreau took the train in 1861) but it also offers more observations about the people and the living conditions out on the prairie. Fuller had more time to spend roaming and adventuring, and she seems to have been more interested in the local culture than the men later were. (Or perhaps Emerson and Thoreau figured that Margaret Fuller had already provided the world with descriptions of the region, so they need not bother.) Midwestern readers should particularly enjoy the historic look at familiar landscapes, written at a time when white settlements were just beginning to congeal and take hold.<br /><br />Secondarily, Fuller focuses much of her writing on the plight of American Indians and also of women in general. She had read a great deal about the native people and seems disappointed to find that most of the Black Hawk War survivors had already moved west by the time of her visit. She also points a critical eye to the fate of the members of her gender who were helping to eke out a living on the prairie: \\"The great drawback upon the lives of these settlers, at present, is the unfitness of the women for their new lot.\\" ... All domestic labor \\"must often be performed, sick or well, by the mother and daughters, to whom a city education has imparted neither the strength nor skill now demanded.\\" (p. 38) And yet, many of the people she meets seem to be happy; and while life is hard and without most amenities, entertainment (even the occasional piano!) and merriment can abound.<br /><br />The narrative tends to languish when Fuller digresses into long-winded stories of the plights of specific women she either knew personally or heard about second- or even thirdhand. While these plot interruptions get tedious to the casual reader, they are further glimpses of feminine life in the early 19th century. Seen in that light, they can provide interesting diversions to the travelogue.<br /><br />Original illustrations by Fuller's traveling companion, Sarah Ann Clarke (sister of James Freeman Clarke) augment the text. This edition's introduction by Susan Belasco Smith helps to bring perspective to the trip and the writing.

But a long-distance train is a mobile motel, a steel-rail Love Boat, full of real and diverse and interesting characters cooped up in a confined area.  There's mystery, there's romance, there's adventure, there's intrigue.  Train lore abounds, and literary and cinematic references are thrown in for good measure.  You cheer for the guy, you cheer for the girl, and somehow -- perhaps with the help of a few surprises and miracles -- things work out in the end...	2002-11-12

And some of our favorite &quot;Cat Who&quot; personalities and families are mentioned, so it's like coming home to familiar faces.  These 27 tales just won't be entertaining or meaningful to anyone who hasn't read at least a few of Braun's episodes.  The best myth / legend is saved for last, in which the mystery of Midwestern scamadiddles is revealed.  That one could be shared aloud with others, even if they don't know that KoKo and Yum Yum are Siamese cats.  But a larger question looms here:  Does this publication, authored by fictional character James &quot;Qwill&quot; Qwilleran, signify the end and culmination of the series?  I hope not.  Those of us who live Down Below still have a need to believe in the existence of eccentric Moose County, 400 miles north of everywhere.  We enjoy visiting there every once in a while, even if the trip is made page-by-page instead of by car or boat.	2002-10-27

You often see those individual paperbacks on sale at nature center gift shops.  Each page features a single plant, animal, or object, and matches simple facts with realistic artwork.  These are the kids of natural items children will be most likely to find in North America.  Relevant basic activities are scattered among the entries.  My favorite section here is from _Birds, Nest, and Eggs_, because each species takes up a double-page spread, with the bird on the left-hand side and its identifiable nest and eggs on the facing page on the right.  The illustrations are beautiful.  Recommended for naturalists, educators, and parents -- anyone who works with young children to help them understand the natural environment around them.	2002-10-27

Because Kinsey Millhone is helping two old friends solve an 18-year-old murder, this mystery is more of an exercise in problem-solving than an action-packed drama.  And that's OK -- we don't need to see our favorite P.I. get beaten up *every* time she questions someone, do we?  As usual, the descriptions here are vivid and the characters are three-dimensional, believable, and suspicious.  Our heroes try to unravel the cold-case puzzle even though Real Life Issues of their own keep interfering.  What makes this episode even more interesting is discovering that the premise is based on a true crime.  Sue Grafton worked with local authorities to examine evidence, pursue leads, and to have an artist create facial replicas of the real Jane Doe whose dead body was dumped in a southern California quarry in 1969.  Though the author provides a plausible series of events throughout the course of the book, the actual murder remains a mystery -- as does the identity of the victim.  The book ends with photos of the facial reconstruction, in the hopes that someone will recognize the young woman and come forth with information.  Gosh, are we in San Jose (aka Santa Teresa), California, or Cabot Cove, Maine???  No matter.  It's still a good mystery.	2002-10-25

This sampler contains essays from nine of his books, from _The Run_ (1959) to _In the Company of Light_ (1998), as well as several of Hay's poems and his John Burroughs Medal acceptance address.  Here you will follow and see along with him as if on the same trail, gleaning tidbits of natural science in the process.  Shorelines and wetlands are the main areas featured -- mostly in New England, and often in Cape Cod -- though a few forays take us to Florida and to the rainforest of Costa Rica.  Read Hay's insights into the intricacies of salt-water habitats, and you're apt to see more the next time you go beach-combing yourself -- from the smallest creatures in the water to the larger ones winging above you.  Here you will also run across Hay's astute environmental observations and admonishments:<br /><br />&quot;Every life that touches on another, or becomes a part of another, keeps the earth's fluidity in being.&quot;  (&quot;Homing,&quot; from _The Undiscovered Country_)<br /><br />&quot;We ought to be tuning up to what is around us, but our own static is too loud.&quot;  (&quot;Listening,&quot; from _The Undiscovered Country_)<br />&quot;At times I think that all the plants, birds, fish, and every other living organism are waiting for our departure so that they can resume timeless engagement with the earth.&quot;  (&quot;Fire in the Plants,&quot; from _A Beginner's Faith in Things Unseen_)<br />This smorgasbord is a nice addition to any nature-lover's bookshelf and could inspire the reader to search out one or more of the featured titles to delve deeper into John Hay's work.	2002-10-15

The title of the book is a bit misleading, though.  While she talks about being a wife and mother and raising her four boys, and she describes her road toward becoming a successful actress, often the monologue returns to memories of her childhood.  Growing up Catholic in a western suburb of Cleveland, she went on to major in drama at Ohio State and then (of course) went off to The Big Apple to make it big.  There she subletted apartment after apartment and worked as a waitress, modelled shoes and wrote copy while trying to get auditions.  We follow her path (almost predictably) to Los Angeles and her eventual arrival on the _Raymond_ series.  She writes the way she talks, and some of the childhood stories are laugh-out-loud funny.  One of the most amusing scenes comes when the Heaton family hosts \\"a Negro couple\\" for dinner on the very same night in 1966 that the Beatles appear on _The Ed Sullivan Show_.  Those of us who grew up in the 1960s -- when entire neighborhoods were our playgrounds -- have similar moments tucked away in our heads.  If we could join in her conversation here, we'd soon be swapping stories and having a merry old time ourselves.<br />Ms. Heaton tells a few tales on herself:  she wet the bed until the age of ten, lost her mother to a brain aneurism when she was twelve, had plastic surgery several times.  And there's a lot she keeps to herself, too.  A first marriage is mentioned in passing, a few drug references are thrown in here and there.  And she tells no tales on her series co-stars, except when she talks about the cast's trip to NYC on September 10, 2001, in order to promote the new season.  The actress already had a commendable perspective on the entertainment business and her own success by that time.  What she lived through that week helped to reinforce it as well as her commitment to her family.<br />This book is a quick read that's not a \\"tell-all\\" but is definitely a \\"told enough.\\"cess by that time.

From his current home on the west coast, he thinks back to his youth and the spring creeks he and friends used to fish in southwestern Wisconsin. That small region is called \\"driftless\\" in geological terms; it's the only part of the state that escaped the flow of the last glacier and thus has more rolling hills and valleys than the rest of the central and upper Midwest. Leeson's reminiscences are supplemented with casual factual information about glacial and nonglacial geology, the science of meandering water, the differences between freestone rivers and spring creeks, the known history of fly-fishing, the Amish methods of sustainable agriculture, and concerns about private ownership of waterways. Interjected bits of natural wisdom provide food for thought: \\"It is no coincidence that the salinity of blood and seawater are the same.\\" Now there's a nugget to throw to the next person you see.<br />Throughout the book's journey, we remember along with him, back to youthful days and times spent with good friends. While the author admits he might not be much of a fisherman -- his first attempt at casting practice in his backyard snagged a small boy from the neighborhood -- he's good at sharing his memories and life observations with us. He paints scenes with words to give us landscapes based in text, not oils. Jerusalem Creek and Emerald Creek (sobriquets to protect their real identities) contained \\"trout of the usual two varieties: the kind we could catch, which were scarce, and the kind we could not, which were abundant.\\" Stream-side attacks by territorial red-winged blackbirds were not uncommon. Now living in Oregon, this displaced Cheesehead still waxes poetic about his homeland: \\"[T]hough the state may not be precisely in the middle of the country, the human heart too is somewhat north and east of center.\\"<br />One gets the distinct impression that Leeson wrote this book as a tribute to a brother now gone. Though the topic is not fully addressed, there are hints at loss and at having \\"a hole in your heart.\\" And that's OK, the way it reads. If he relayed his personal history to us over a few cold ones in a nearby tavern, we'd probably be polite enough not to ask the direct questions. But we'd always wonder what really happened. And here the reader is also kept wondering.<br />When Leeson and his comrades return as adults to fish in Jerusalem Creek, the memories and realities come full circle.

In 19th-century terms, this treatise is a modified travelogue based on a 13-day boat trip that Henry and his brother John took in 1839. By today's standards, contemporary editors and many an English teacher would decorate this manuscript with red ink and admonish the author that he strays too often and too far from the main subject. Bill Bryson's essays wander too, but he doesn't usually reach back and quote the Bhagavad-Gita, Homer, Chaucer, or Shakespeare. But whenever Henry takes in his surroundings, he is reminded of something else, and before you know it a serious discourse is off and running, and it has nothing to do with floating upstream or down. He expresses his opinions or offers his knowledge about fish, mythology, religion, poetry, reading, writing, history, government, traveling, waterfalls, friendship, love, life, nature, art, dreams, and science. He reminisces about a previous trip to the Berkshires and a sail down the Connecticut River. He breaks into poetry at whim -- sometimes his own words, more often someone else's. Along the way, the brothers paddle from Concord, Massachusetts, to the area around Concord, New Hampshire, and then turn around and go home. We meet some of the people they encounter along the way and get a glimpse of New England life during that time period. In some respects, the people and the land haven't changed much at all. We can see Thoreau's environmentalism when he talks about dams and their effects on the habits and habitats of fish -- concerns that are still with us today. We can laugh at his puns and enjoy his wordplay (i.e., \\"The shallowest still water is unfathomable\\" and Man needs \\"not only to be spiritualized, but *naturalized*, on the soil of earth.\\") Above all, we can explore these rivers and shorelines during a time period that we will never see personally, with the aid of a native naturalist who's in the habit of sharing his observations and thoughts.<br />Read _Walden_ first.

This volume is the multigenerational saga of the fictitious Bell family of Charleston, South Carolina.  Its timeline runs from 1720 to 1866 and thus covers a host of tumultuous times in the Low Country community.<br />_Charleston_ is divided into three \\"books.\\"  Book One sees Edward Bell fighting on the side of the American Revolution, both before and after Charleston's surrender to the British.  Those of us with northern upbringing and education tend to equate the Revolution with Massachusetts in April 1775, not South Carolina in 1781.  Either we never learned that Charleston fell to the British in that war, or we had no idea what that meant.  Of course, the battle of the colonists versus the loyalists divides the Bell family as well, and the rift seems to widen as the decades pass.  Book Two follows Alexandra Bell, her brother Hampton, and their cousins Ouida and Gibbes as they react to slavery issues and take sides in the ever-escalating debate between nullification and Unionism.  Standard history books will tell you that this period is technically pre-Civil War, but it's far from a time of peace and non-violence for the Bells and other Carolinians.  Alexandra moves north to join the abolitionist crusade while her brother and cousins go in different directions.  Book Three covers the constant Civil War bombing of Charleston and its eventual surrender to Union forces.  We trace the paths of the older Bell cousins as Alexandra comes back home, and son and nephew Calhoun Hayward spends time in several military prisons in Delaware and Ohio.  Even after the war is over, divisions continue.  Some residents are eager to rebuild and start over, and some can't get past a consuming blaming and hatred of Yankees.  Some are pleased the blacks are freed; others are afraid.  The extended Bell family and their friends are a microcosm of it all.<br />As with other Jakes titles, fiction interacts with reality, and the Bells end up meeting a number of \\"famous\\" people along the way.  This time, they're either military figures (Colonel Francis \\"Swamp Fox\\" Marion, General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, Jefferson Davis) or abolitionists (the Grimke sisters, William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass).  The author also includes the kind of historical detail we've come to expect from his writing.  Reading it thoroughly immerses one into that time period.<br />I enjoyed reading this book and am giving it only four stars because of its demands on the reader.  This is not frivolous stuff, and it won't appeal to everyone.  _Charleston_ takes time to digest, to remember characters and all the incidental faces that appear in the storylines, and to occasionally look up unfamiliar words.  (I personally can't wait to call someone an \\"ill-bred parvenu\\" or a \\"termagant,\\" and I might even run into an \\"Augean stable\\" along the way.) It's helpful that the volume is physically divided into three books with smaller segues between, and the last 200 pages go much faster than the first 300.<br />Jakes leaves a few threads hanging, and a sequel could be possible.

Thus, the book includes state parks, county forest preserve centers, and sites owned by private organizations. No other source I'm familiar with has done that for the Prairie State. Even spots like the Chicago Botanic Gardens, the Brookfield Zoo, and the Cahokia Mounds are listed here. Each entry includes a general description, a list of programs and events, regulations, hours, directions, contact information (formal address, phone number, and often web site), and begins with the highlights and what makes the place special. I've been to 18 of the 132 -- I've got some traveling to do, I guess -- and can verify that the details seem to be correct, as far as I know. I'm giving the book just four stars for two reasons: (a) the authors didn't include any sites managed by the McHenry County Conservation District and (b) the b&w photos are muddy at times and not necessarily indicative of the uniqueness of the sites. (A photo of a trail sign next to a path could probably be taken anywhere.) Still, this volume is a wonderful guidebook for any Illinoisan to own. Let's hope its publicity will help Prairie Staters to understand that Nature *is* alive and well here, and they don't have to go to Wisconsin or Michigan to see it. Now, how can we get the authors to do the same research for all the other states in the Union???  [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]	2002-08-05

It is the dream devoutly to be wished, and God help anyone who trys to buck border traffic on I-90 and I-94 on a Friday or Sunday afternoon. Carter follows this trend, and even though some of these essays show that his interest in nature begins in Illinois -- with a trip down the Des Plaines River and one through the Skokie Lagoons -- it's the title essay and his experiences with Wisconsin land ownership that are the most personal.<br /><br /> Door County is the armlike peninsula that stretches northeastward into Lake Michigan. It could be considered to be the Cape Cod of the Midwest. Carter was inspired to first visit that part of Wisconsin by the work of landscape architect Jens Jensen. Then Carter himself bought some property there, cleared it a little, and sat in the middle of it on a folding chair. Eventually he decided a homemade cabin would be more practical. In Thoreauvian style, he lets us in on the building process. And he shares his encounters with the animals and plants around him. His words are accompanied by the exquisite pencil drawings of Carolyn Kenney. The pictures alone are worth the price of the volume.<br /><br />It might be difficult to get hold of this book, but naturalists living in either IL or WI would benefit from owning their own copies.

It's a chance for us to dip into the lifestyle of small-town America (and Italy) and the sensual landscapes of the southwestern Virginia mountains as well as the Italian Alps.  It's encounters with unique and sometimes eccentric individuals who, in spite of their quirks or problems, endear themselves to us when they show they care about the people around them.  It's a study of changing relationships between parents and children, between best friends, even between good friends of opposite genders.  It's also a search for a personal sense of place:  finding the exact spot on Earth where you are supposed to live, what you're supposed to do, and who you're supposed to be doing it with.  And the ending leaves the door open for further adventures.<br /><br />_Milk Glass Moon_ is such an engaging and easy read that, if you've got the time, you can easily finish this book in just one sitting.  But that's almost cheating yourself of being able to spend valuable time with these intriguing characters.  Perhaps we should savor every moment.<br /><br />If Ms. Trigiani is scheduled to appear at a book signing near you, don't hesitate to go to see her.

One can't help but wonder why.<br /><br />The author advances his topic through general themes and the various ways in which Thoreau used walking: as the perfect transcendental physical and mental exercise; as the investigation of nature and the wider landscape; as a way to rid the mind and body of civilization in order to think straight; as a way to exhibit nonconformity and individuality; as a way to inspire writing or garnish income by surveying.  I find it particularly curious that only two pages are devoted to surveying, which was one of Thoreau's primary means of support and which got him travelling around his town, learning the nooks and crannies of Concord properties, providing the walking experience while allowing him to unearth natural discoveries along the way.  Surely that part of his life deserves more than a mere two pages of coverage, especially when he had to walk to do the job.<br /><br />Perhaps the casual Thoreauvian will pluck this book off a shelf because the title sounds as though it might be a guidebook for applying Thoreau's philosophies to our lives today.  Well, that gentle reader will be disappointed.  By changing one word in the title, the author could have given us a better expectation of the content.  If the subtitle instead read:  \\"Thoreau and HIS search for self,\\" then we would know that it's all about the famous naturalist's physical and introspective journeys, and not a model for our own.  Smith sticks only to literary analysis.  If he had gone that one step further -- both literally and figuratively -- and shown how Thoreau's experience can apply to our own search for self today, a person would have a real reason to pick up this book.<br /><br />For it is painfully obvious that Smith has most likely never seen the places Thoreau visited.  While Thoreau could claim, \\"I have traveled much in Concord,\\" the reader gets the impression that Smith can't say the same.  He sticks to literary analysis and never puts himself into the picture.  In a passage on page 106, Thoreau is quoted as having earlier traversed \\"a rocky hillside where the sweet-fern grows for a mile.\\"  The casual reader might be interested in knowing that sweet-fern still grows on the northern rocky shore of Walden Pond; and when you squeeze a leaf between your fingertips, a lovely spicy scent stays with you for the rest of your walk.  But Smith probably doesn't know that.  Instead he spends four pages of the final chapter mentioning articles and books written by those who actually HAVE attempted to walk in Thoreau's footsteps.  Thus this book appears to be written by someone who has READ quite a bit but has not DONE.  And yet Thoreau is quoted on page 182:  \\"The forcible writer stands bodily behind his words with his experience.  He does not make books out of books, but he has been *there* in person.\\"  Evidently Smith read and copied those words but did not heed their admonishment.<br /><br />The text itself saunters along.  It isn't broken by subheadings for emphasis or for easy reference, and no index is included, so its academic usefulness is limited.  This book is not designed in a way to be accessible to scholars, and it's not written with contemporary lifestyle application in mind.  So the question on the reader's mind is:  Why should we care? Or, Why am I reading this?  Hmmm.  Why, indeed.<br /><br />I should mention that I found Smith's list of sources moderately useful.  Some interesting titles about walking or about Thoreau appear in the bibliography, and they are worthy of further investigation.  So my investment in purchasing this volume was not a total loss.<br /><br />Here's the coup de grace:  A lovely ethereal photo of the North Bridge graces the cover, providing yet another temptation for the casual reader tobelieve that held within are the secrets of how we can use Henry David Thoreau's writings in order to live our lives today.  For of course the savvy Thoreauvian knows that while the North Bridge is indeed an historical symbol of Concord, Massachusetts, no bridge existed in that spot from 1793 to 1875.  Thoreau (1817-1862) would not have and could not have walked its expanse.  Ah, the irony.to believe that held within are the secrets of how we can use Henry David Thoreau's writings in order to live our lives today.

Jennifer Chiaverini has created a sequence of titles that do indeed share the same setting and some of the same individuals, but in a multidimensional way.  The characters take on different roles in each book -- some move into the foreground, and others move back.  The resulting stand-alone novels are not cookie-cutter episodes by any means.  _The Quilter's Apprentice_ provided the framework and introduced us to Sylvia and Sarah.  _Round Robin_ focused on the other members of the Elm Creek Quilters group, whom we had previously met only superficially.  _The Cross-Country Quilters_ followed some of the quilt campers to their distant homes and lives and then traced them back to Elm Creek.  Now _The Runaway Quilt_ returns the plot to Sylvia, but in a unique historical way.  As she reads an old family memoir and looks at the old quilts found with it, she and the readers are left to wonder if we can really ever know who our ancestors were and how they lived.  The information unveiled will probably surprise you as much as it does Sylvia.  Who would have thought that 21st-century folk could still be affected by the Civil War?  Maybe we all ought to go back and read _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ again.	2002-07-22

Keep the information in its separate realms of geology, botany, zoology, and anthropology?  Start in Alabama and work northward?  Go state by state, province by province, and look at the smaller specific mountain ranges?  Well, Scott Weidensaul has taken none of those approaches, thank goodness.  His is an education by general themes: basic geology (for it must start there), bird migrations, habitat specialization, forestry, mammalian zoology, archaeology, pollination, extinction, survival.  Each chapter has a pure focus; and yet all of the chapters somehow touch on all of these topics.  Weidensaul's conversational style has the reader walking through the woods with him, chatting seemingly aimlessly, all the time seeing and learning about the life that abounds.  Gems of detail sneak up on us while we read.  If you travel 1000 feet up, the habitat and ecosystems change as if you had traveled 100 miles north.  Wow.  And then there are the interspecies connections, some well-known and some new to us: squirrels and oaks, oaks and gypsy moths, migratory birds and fatty fruits, white pines and ship masts, bears and wetlands, fishers and porcupines, crossbills and spruces.  The natural world makes sense after reading this book.  Highly recommended for naturalists everywhere and mandatory reading for residents of the Appalachian states and provinces.	2002-07-21

This supplement to traditional field guides is divided into sections by animal type (mammals, birds, etc.) and provides such details as eating habits, favored habitats, longevity, home regions, and population distribution.  Fergus assembles factual information into a leisurely readable format and adds his own observations from time to time.  Here you'll find out why that dead shrew is lying on the trail in front of you, or how much food a red-tail hawk eats in a day.  Amelia Hansen's exquisite drawings depict many of the animals listed and are accurate enough and beautiful enough to be framed and hung on a wall.  The only omission is a visual sample of each animal's tracks, but other books can help you in that area.  I can't wait for the companion book on *trees* to be issued!	2002-07-06

He built a cottage at the edge of his property when he and his wife separated, and so he distanced himself from the trappings of civilization at the same time. Most of them, at least. Here he relates stories from his first year at the cottage, complete with woodland encounters with wildlife, bizarre and unique individuals, and unknown shapes and spirits. He doesn't spend all his time there: he works, he travels, he investigates a local computer company. Like Thoreau, Mitchell is no hermit. And there's so much Thoreau in this volume that when you finish turning *these* pages, you might very well find yourself reaching next for _Walden_. A thought-provoking and entertaining book.	2002-07-04

This book is an easy, enlightening read that will not only have you looking differently at your own neighborhood but also contemplating our traditional notions of time.  &quot;[W]e are the future of the past, and the past of the future.&quot;  (p. 200)  Certainly food for thought.	2002-07-02

For years, he kept a journal of catches, sites, times, water temperatures, and just about anything else you can think of to describe the days and the activities.  Here he's taken those figures and put the information in essay form.  The first half of this book follows his personal trial-and-error process over twenty years as he matured into an adult and an experienced fly-fisherman.  The second half is devoted to strategies of reading water, techniques of fly-tying, types of rods, and recommendations for what works best in given situations.  The \\"trout at the walnut tree\\" is the one who eluded Tate for almost the whole duration of a fishing season, and an entire chapter describes the many trysts that took place between the two.  Because he abhors \\"kiss-and-tell fishermen,\\" you won't learn the exact names and locations of his favorite fishing holes.  You *will* read about night fishing, dealing with a raging bull in a meadow, the ethics of catch and release, and being a good husband and father while maintaining a demanding hobby at the same time.  Even if you're not a sportsman, you'll find yourself entertained and will learn more about fly-fishing than you probably thought possible.	2002-06-30

Still, there are some interesting criticisms and assessments voiced here.  Don't expect a chapter-by-chapter Cliffs Notes analysis, but rather several opinions on the whole work or on specific themes.  The editor himself advises us \\"to recognize that _Walden_ is a carefully articulated, full-length book.\\"  So often we hear or read only snippets or key quotes, and we lose Thoreau's flavor and his descriptions that build up to his points.  Most of the selections in this book are positive, and some are absolutely glowing.  E. B. White says that \\"Thoreau, very likely without knowing quite what he was up to, took man's relation to nature and man's dilemma in society and man's capacity for elevating his spirit and he beat all these matters together, in a wild free interval of self-justification and delight, and produced an original omelette from which people can draw nourishment in a hungry day.\\"  Wow!  John C. Broderick claims that \\"_Walden_ itself might be regarded as a year-long walk, for as in his daily walk Thoreau moved away from the mundane world of the village toward one of heightened awareness and potentiality, only to return spiritually reinvigorated, so _Walden_ records an adventuring on life which structurally starts from and returns to the world of quiet desperation.\\"  Of course this is true; why haven't the rest of us thought of this?  Leo Marx focuses in on Thoreau's words about the railroad and the workers (and the riders) on it:  \\"The episode demonstrates that the Walden site cannot provide a refuge, in any literal sense, from the forces of change.\\"  Wow, again.<br /><br />This piece of literary criticism contains 8 major essays and 25 pages of random thoughts from others.  It can be enlightening to students of Thoreau and of the transcendentalist movement, though high schoolers may stumble over some of the vocabulary used.me of the vocabulary used.	2002-06-30

But they do, and Charles Fergus has hiked in all 61 of them. The natural areas he's talking about here are located in state forests and have few recreational amenities, so they're open only to foot traffic. Habitats range from the tidal waters around Little Tinicum Island in the Delaware River to the forested crest and tower at the top of Mount Davis in Somerset County, the highest point in the Commonwealth. Many of these areas gained governmental protection within our lifetime, and I'm sure other natives will learn about sites they never heard of before. Basic road atlases don't usually acknowledge these places. Fergus provides detailed directions for access, writes about the uniqueness of each site, and recommends the best seasons for visits. His commentary is accompanied by black and white photos and may include smatterings of geology, history, anthropology, botany, and zoology. Wildlife ranges from bears and bobcats to salamanders and the tiny critters they feast on. There are bird migration routes, sites for butterfly aficionados, many tall trees and rare plants. A path falls onto land where chips of indigenous tools can still be found, and another turns onto a trail made more recently by an illegal all-terrain vehicle. A map, list of resources, and list of forestry addresses contribute to the usefulness of this guide. Scanning just a few pages will have you reaching for your boots and daypack in no time.	2002-06-26

Thoreau, a Writer's Journal	Books	5	15	15	N	N	The best of Thoreau's journal	Because Henry David Thoreau's work is in the public domain, it's easy to run across any number of compilations of his most profound or most quotable words.  Perhaps these mini-anthologies are simpler to digest than, say, every single page of _Walden_, or every one of the 14 volumes of his _Journal_.  Let's face it:  most people don't get or take the chance to read either one.  So it's nice that Laurence Stapleton took the time to read the _Journal_ and select crucial parts for us to study.  Here Thoreau is at his best in describing his neighbors or his walks around Concord and his art of observing Nature.  His recordings are mostly made under what most people would consider adverse conditions:  in fog, in rain, in snow, or at night.  He notices phenomena reflected only in the water of a pond or the ice-covering of a wintry field.  He is a practiced \\"seer,\\" and his writing inspires the reader to see as well.<br /><br />His writing.  Of course!  This book is subtitled _A Writer's Journal_ for good reason.  Stapleton specifically picked out many entries where Thoreau ruminates about his own writing and the creative process.  To this end, this book reads like a 19th-century _Chicken Soul for the Writer's Soul_.  Anyone who writes can identify with considerations like these:<br /><br />\\"The best you can write will be the best you are.  Every sentence is the result of a long probation.  The author's character is read from title-page to end.  Of this he never corrects the proofs.\\"  (Feb. 28, 1841)<br /><br />\\"We cannot write well or truly but what we write with gusto.  The body, the senses, must conspire with the mind.  Expression is the act of the whole man, that our speech may be vascular.  The intellect is powerless to express thought without the aid of the heart and the liver and of every member.\\"  (Sept. 2, 1851)<br /><br />\\"Write often, write upon a thousand themes, rather than long at a time, not trying to turn too many feeble somersaults in the air,--and so come down upon your head at last.\\" (Nov. 12, 1851)<br /><br />\\"I wish that I could buy at the shops some kind of india-rubber that would rub out at once all that in my writing which it now costs me so many perusals, so many months if not years, and so much reluctance, to erase.\\"  (Dec. 27, 1853)<br /><br />\\"Time never passes so quickly and unaccountably as when I am engaged in composition, i.e. in writing down my thoughts.  Clocks seem to have been put forward.\\"  (Jan. 27, 1858)<br /><br />\\"The more you have thought and written on a given theme, the more you can still write.  Thought breeds thought.  It grows under your hands.\\"  (Feb. 13, 1860)<br /><br />(Is he speaking to *us* or to *himself*?) We also see publication notes of the two books released during Thoreau's lifetime, _A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers_ and _Walden_.  We read discourses and ramblings that will later become essays like \\"Slavery in Massachusetts\\" and \\"A Plea for Captain John Brown.\\"  The latter are served without any intrusion from the editor, so the savvy reader might need to brush up on pre-Civil War history to put the words into context.

I temporarily forgot that Aldo Leopold came to the field with a hunting background.  And even though he writes about being forever affected by the regretable dying fire in a she-wolf's eyes in _Sand County Almanac_, none of that feeling is conveyed here.  There's a lot of hunting in this book.  A lot.  Part II is one camping trip after another, with a fair amount of innocent animals providing food along the way.  If you're like me and would rather not witness the carnage, read just four or five of the selections:  \\"A Man's Leisure Time,\\" \\"Country,\\" \\"Natural History,\\" and all of Part III.  You probably won't miss anything crucial by doing so, and you'll get the gist of Aldo Leopold's ideas about conservation and the land ethic.  His philosophic musings make for worthwhile reading.

Guess the old adage about not being able to please everyone still holds true.<br /><br />Why not look at this slender volume as an interesting twist to a previous tale?  Or as a wonderful lesson in writing and in characterization?  To be able to create a _Who's Who_ citation of one of your characters:  how cool is that?  To be able to write fiction as if it were true -- and the occasional footnotes used here *still* make you wonder -- how marvelous is that?  Do you know how many people looked up the original _National Geographic_ article after \\"Bridges\\" and were severely disappointed to discover that there never was a photospread about Madison County, Iowa? (Can you imagine how many others will follow the citations in \\"Thousand Country Roads\\" to the same result?) What a wonderful compliment to the author!  Have you ever driven across Iowa on the interstate and followed the signs and seen the actual farmhouse where the \\"Bridges\\" movie was shot?  To be sure, there is magic surrounding both the storyline and the place.  Waller has simply extended the spell to include the West Coast and South Dakota.

The analogy is a quiet one whose applications do not escape the savvy reader:  motherhood, childhood, independence, tradition, nature, leaving relatives behind, beating the odds, finding your home.  The main characters are women of all ages, and the strong ones help the not-so-strong.  Hindsight tells you that the plot-lines are somewhat predictable, but it just doesn't matter.  The story will connect with you if you've ever visited Charleston and its nearby beaches.  It will touch you if you're a romantic at heart.  It will affirm your deepest beliefs if you consider yourself an environmentalist.  It will scream volumes to you if you're in your 40s and are considering a career and/or lifestyle change.  And you'd better find a comfortable place to spend the last 60 pages, `cause you ain't goin' nowhere.  As reviewer Harriet advises, you'd better have a full box of tissues next to you at that point.

The text is enhanced with copies of several original manuscript pages as well as individual photos of Thoreau and his family members.  Don't skip the editor's introduction, because that's where you'll learn who the contributors were and why they were asked to write something for this collection.  While this title isn't entirely a volume of literary criticism, some pieces fit that description.  Read _Walden_, and then read Walter Harding's \\"Five Ways of Looking at Walden.\\"  After _The Maine Woods_, read \\"Fanny Eckstorm's Bias\\" by Mary P. Sherwood.  Read Thoreau's tribute to John Brown, and then see Truman Nelson's \\"Thoreau and John Brown\\" essay.  And since this particular book was put together (and revised in 1966) during a time of unrest regarding American civil rights and Vietnam war protests, be sure to re-read \\"Civil Disobedience\\" and then read the comments made here by Martin Luther King, William Stuart Nelson, Martin Buber, and others.  The book ends with Stanley Edgar Hyman's review of the then-extant Thoreau biographies.  The result is an interesting combination of articles and tributes: some containing juicy tidbits of little-known information, and some offering opinions that are perhaps a bit tough for Thoreau fans and transcendental aficionados to swallow.  Enlightening and entertaining and worth paging through if you see it on a library shelf, but not as useful to students and scholars as other collections are.	2002-05-26

Even though the set was first published in the 1960s, the scholarly pieces of literary criticism found here can provide students with interesting perspectives from which to view an author's work.  This kind of book is not designed to be read from cover to cover; even the most devoted followers of Thoreau (in this case) are apt to find themselves reading the same paragraph a dozen times every once in a while, or perhaps even occasionally nodding off.  It's not a late-night page-turner. (!)<br /><br />Nevertheless, this title contains 16 entries that touch on themes in _Walden_, _A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers_, Thoreau's _Journal_, his poetry, and his views on individualism, simplicity, politics, and Indians.  All were written in the first half of the 20th century. Appropriately enough, the volume begins and ends with a poetry tribute to Henry David Thoreau:  Yeats' &quot;The Lake Isle of Innisfree&quot; and &quot;Letter from a Distant Land&quot; by Philip Booth.  The excerpts that appear here do not overlap with those found in _Thoreau in our Season_ or _Twentieth Century Interpretations of Walden_.  So if you've got a literature project underway, perhaps you'd better look at all the offerings on the library shelf.

Forget the book reviews -- they can wait until lunchtime.  I *have* to read Will Manley first.  He's the Dave Barry of librarianship, the Andy Rooney of bibliophiles, the Jerry Seinfeld of bookworms.  His comments are always on the mark and usually make me smile and nod my head in agreement.  Here, his observations about goofy patrons with bizarre questions and typical reference desk scenarios are accompanied by Richard Lee's funky illustrations.  The result is the kind of honest silliness that should first be thoroughly enjoyed by oneself and then immediately shared with colleagues.  Though this book is clearly one of specialized humor, anyone who works in a public service occupation will recognize some of the customer categories -- \\"Dorkus Completis,\\" \\"Studentus Moronis,\\" \\"Parentus Irresponsibilis,\\" and the rest.  If a layperson stumbles across these pages, let the outcome be that he/she learned that (a) librarians are people too and (b) that they have a good sense of humor.  It might be a strange and twisted kind, but it is humor nevertheless.  Thank you, Will, for encouraging us to laugh at ourselves.	2002-05-17

The writing is fine, the essence of Thoreau appears, the major life details are all there, and Krutch is obviously familiar with his subject matter.  But whenever he quotes the naturalist, he never includes specific citations locating those words.  How frustrating for any reader who is enticed here by a turn of phrase or an idea and wants to pick up _Walden_ or Thoreau's _Journal_ to find them for himself / herself!  If other sources or friends like Ralph Waldo Emerson or Ellery Channing are quoted, no further information on origin is provided.  We have no clue where Krutch found those communications.  He wasn't in Concord in the mid-1800s, so he must be repeating words written in other documents or published works.  For the casual reader, maybe this major omission is not a problem.  If you just want the basics of Thoreau's life and philosophies and writings, then maybe this volume is enough for you.  But with no citation notes and no credits and no bibliography, I found it wasn't enough for me.<br /><br />If you are sincerely interested in the man who is most often identified with Walden Pond and with the concept of civil disobedience, then pick up one of the classic biographies of him -- either _The Days of Henry Thoreau_ by Walter Harding or _Thoreau_ by Henry Seidel Canby.  Those two volumes are a little longer and more extensive than Krutch's (especially Canby's), but they will serve you better.  I believe they serve Thoreau better as well.	2002-05-06

If you're an avid nature fan yourself, you've probably read about some of these men in other books.  And yet, here each chapter is more than mere biography.  Vickery highlights personal details that bring these men to life again, and we see not just the individuals, but also the natural places that mattered the most to them.  We hear what they had to say about those places in their own words.  Coincidentally -- or, not -- each of the eight spent at least a little time in Vickery's native Minnesota, and so it is from an additional love of his own land that the author relates the stories.  Writers are always advised to write what they know, and that knowledge comes through in this book.  An engaging addition to the environmentalist's bookshelf.  Finding a used copy is well worth the search.	2002-05-06

Each of these writer-naturalists is most often identified geographically with the setting of his best-known work (i.e., Walden Pond or the Sierra Mountains). Each was intrigued by a vastly different habitat located north of his usual stomping ground -- and was so enticed by that wilderness region that he made multiple visits and took copious notes on everything he saw. For Thoreau, it was the forests and mountains of Maine, while Muir delighted in the glaciers of Alaska. Both made their trips by water with native guides but also with at least one old friend along for companionship. They later produced travelogue essays and / or lectures about their journeys, both describing miles and miles of terrain and the very few residents they encountered along the way. Both _The Maine Woods_ and _Travels in Alaska_ chronicle the discoveries made during three separate trips: Thoreau's adventures occurred in 1846, 1853, and 1857; and Muir's happened in 1879, 1880 and 1890. Both men died of a lung disease (tuberculosis, pneumonia) before making final edits on the third portion, the last journey, of each book. Both of the resulting books were put together by surviving relatives and were published posthumously. Eerie, isn't it?<br />That being said, my advice to the reader of Thoreau is the same as written in my review of Muir's _Travels in Alaska_: Don't read this one first if you haven't read anything else by him. Read _Walden_ and some of the shorter travel pieces before moving on to _The Maine Woods_. Here Thoreau is at once fascinated by the thickness of the forests and appalled by the devastation caused by the lumber industry. You'll follow him up Mount Katahdin and canoe along with him on lakes and down rivers. You'll learn about the kind of true camping that could be done only in the wilds of sparsely-inhabited country. You'll see lots of trees and plants and animals and hear some of Thoreau's opinions about nature and mankind. And you'll be pleased to know that everyone returns home safely in the end.<br />Thoreau was asked on his deathbed if he had made his peace with God. His retort was, \\"I did not know we had ever quarrelled.\\" Even though he told a friend that he would die without regret, these kinds of last-minute questions must have forced him to take quiet mental stock of the events of his life in search of something that didn't quite fit with his philosophy. It is said that his final words were \\"moose\\" and \\"Indian.\\" I believe that, with those utterances, he had finally realized his sole regret in life: that he had witnessed the killing of several Maine moose -- the last one, by his Indian guide -- and had done nothing to stop the slaughter. Whenever the hunters were thus engaged, Thoreau retreated to his botanizing and documenting the plant life in the area. He deliberately put blinders on at a time when he could have prevented the animals' deaths. And perhaps his own rationalizing behavior was not made clear to him until the end. For as he says here in the \\"Chesuncook\\" chapter, \\"Every creature is better alive than dead, men and moose and pine-trees, and he who understands it aright will rather preserve its life than destroy it.\\" That statement could be a personal chastisement, a reminder to himself.

Peter Fiore's exquisite paintings provide vibrant accompaniment to each quotation. The result is a beautiful \\"picture book\\" any Thoreau fan would be proud to own.<br />I'm not sure that its target audience should be very young children. If kids pull this one off the shelf, the meaning of the words will be lost on them, and the artwork that goes along with the text won't build the story on its own. Though full of the Walden spirit, this book isn't as engaging to the youngest readers as D. B. Johnson's similar _Henry Builds a Cabin_ or _Henry Hikes to Fitchburg_. Perhaps its best use would be as a multigenerational preface to Thoreau's work, with teacher-student or parent-child combinations reading the book together. _Henry David's House_ could introduce middle school and high school students to the literary and scientific portions of _Walden_ and could serve as a first step in their acquaintance with the author. Teens and pre-teens may balk at being read to, but they're also visual learners who are at an age to appreciate the presentation here. And if it inspires them to pick up Thoreau's classic to read for themselves, so much the better.	2002-03-25

Twelve-year-old Rachel Curtis is beginning to balk at the traditional female role being thrust upon her, and she also happens to be a talented artist.  She'd rather sketch the woodgrain pattern of a log than do household chores.  (Who wouldn't?)  She's encouraged to pursue her craft by a local teacher and by several famous residents, and although Rachel's family members are cautiously supportive, they cannot afford to send her to Boston, New York or Paris to study with an artist.  Rachel is lucky enough to meet Henry David Thoreau at his Walden Pond cabin, and he in turn introduces her to Margaret Fuller.  Through Margaret's connections, the young girl begins a correspondence study with an artist in New York. By the end of the book, Thoreau's made arrangements with the William Emerson family to house Rachel in the big city while she continues her personal study.  We're satisfied at the end of the book that Rachel will realize her creative dreams.<br />  What's missing here is an appendix that provides factual information about Thoreau and Fuller and indicates to the uninitiated reader that the two of them are not fictional characters.  Even D.B. Johnson provides such notes at the end of _Henry Hikes to Fitchburg_ and _Henry Builds a Cabin_, his picture books based on Thoreau's life.  Faigen should probably also take an opportunity to explain that many of the lines that come out of Henry's mouth here are quotes adapted from _Walden_.  Young readers could then be directed to read that classic if they were intrigued by his character's behavior and opinions in this book.  Since Margaret Fuller is the lesser known of the two celebrities featured, it would be a valuable service to the readers to tell of her good writing work and her fateful death at sea, since that would happen sometime in the next few chapters if Rachel's world continued.<br /><br />_Finding Her Way_ is still a fine introduction to the life of the times and the transcendental movement.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.<br /> Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.<br /> I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager.

It's a worthwhile read in its own right, don't get me wrong.  But read _My First Summer in the Sierra_ or a Muir biography like Michael P. Cohen's _The Pathless Way_ before you move on to this one.  Get a good dose of what the naturalist is like and learn some of his background, and then you'll be in the proper frame of mind to tackle _Travels in Alaska_.  Otherwise, this book is just one glacier after another.  And bless his heart, Muir wants to see them all.  And climb them and explore them and sketch them and hike their entire lengths and write about them ad nauseum.  He leaves his companions in his wake and puts himself squarely in the face of isolated danger over and over again.  Read this book first, and you'll think he's insane.  Know his roots in Wisconsin and his good work in California, and you'll be better able to appreciate what he thinks of and does in the Alaska of the late 1800s.	2002-03-02

Olson's essays convey the spirit and sense of place in what is now known as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area -- Superior National Forest in Minnesota and Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario.  North country life is special, and Olson obviously loved living there.  He writes with delight of seeing Northern Lights, portaging canoes, cross country skiing, hearing the echoes of loons calling, and witnessing the occasional mouse tobogganing off a tent roof.  Though the chapters are organized by seasons and begin with Spring, it is the essence of cold and snow and winter that carries the reader through the book.  Best to be read by a warm fireplace with a light snow falling outside and a mug of hot chocolate nearby.	2002-01-06

Thoreau and Muir appear often in works of this kind, and Powell is occasionally added and is best known for his trip down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon.  But what of Marsh?  This Vermont lawyer, legislator, and industrialist published the book _Man and Nature_ in 1864.  His travels to Europe and the Middle East were part of his enlightenment into the relationship between humans and Nature.  He was one of the first individuals to admit that \\"all nature is linked together by invisible bonds\\" and to see man as a \\"destructive power\\" in the scenario.  He recommended restoration efforts for the rampant deforestation in the northeastern America of the mid-1800s and suggested governmental control of such an endeavor, in spite of that institution's many failings.  For the biography of Marsh alone, Dorman's book is worthwhile reading.  But even if you think you already know the basics about the other three personalities, you'll learn something new here.  Dorman doesn't just rehash old information; he provides a fresh interpretation of their contributions, illustrating the societal influences that formed their belief systems, and connecting each man to at least one of the other three at least once.  A good addition to the 21st-century environmentalist's bookshelf.	2002-01-02

His motivation for writing such words seems to have been his neighbors' apathy and indifference toward the natural world, for &quot;A man sees only what concerns him.&quot;  And so Thoreau speaks of the beauty of purple grasses and of maples, elms, and oaks.  He doesn't mind the fallen willow leaves that land in his boat and doesn't clean them out -- he accepts them as extra cushioning for his seat.  One wonders what Henry would think now, when tourists are apt to drive to New England on fall weekends, just to see the leaves.  There's no earth-shattering revelations in this booklet.  It's just an easy read for a crisp and bright October day.	2002-01-02

(Read Wigginton's book, _Sometimes a Shining Moment:  A Foxfire Experience_, if you can locate it.)  In each instance, a well-meaning and hopeful young teacher was dropped into what seemed to be an almost impossible educational situation -- an isolated community with seemingly backward students, nonexistent funds for decent materials, and goals and textbooks that didn't come close to meeting students' needs.  In Conroy's case, the added strains of regional racism and administrative power games were too much to overcome, and he had to leave after serving a little more than a year there.<br />And yet, _The Water is Wide_ is a humorous book.  We laugh at the white teacher's ignorance of the Gullah children's lifestyles, and we laugh at the children's reactions to the facts he tries to teach them.  It's one \\"fish out of water\\" gag after another, so to speak.  We applaud Conroy's dismissal of the educational chain of command and we cross our fingers that field trips to the mainland will come off without a hitch.  We hope that the students will be better off than they ever were before his arrival; for this commentary on one year at one small elementary school stands for all the rest of us, across time, at all the other schools in the nation.<br />The most disturbing fact here is that those of us working in public education today can easily recognize practices that we still have to deal with:  superintendents as dictators; ineffective or intimidating school boards; administrators who rule from afar and never set foot in any classroom.  Most of us squeeze the living daylights out of the scantiest of budgets and rebel against the pressure to see the kids as testing statistics rather than human beings.  It's all right there, in Conroy's book, and it's still in our schools today.  So you can read his words and say to yourself, \\"Geez, at least we don't have it THAT bad,\\" or you can find yourself commiserating with him and saying, \\"Wow.  We're not that different.

Who's there?  And what's it like to live there?  Those questions and more are answered by Paul Brooks in this fine book.  He uses a humanities approach to uncover the history of culture, politics, education, literacy, and women's lives in this one particular area of New England.  And you won't run into just the usual familiar families -- the Emersons, Hawthornes, Thoreaus, and Alcotts -- but will learn of other folks of Concord as well:  farmer George Minott, lawyer Samuel Hoar, doctor Josiah Bartlett, and constable Sam Staples, to name a few.  One chapter is devoted entirely to the operation of Brook Farm, a utopian community founded by Dr. George Ripley that was beginning to struggle by the year in question.  Photos of key people and period illustrations augment the very readable text.

Nearly two and a half centuries after that land survey took place, William Ecenbarger travels along the famous border not only to reminisce about that task but also to document some of the lives that have lived there since.  It's not a pristine picture.  Race relations loom large in his findings.  Reverse Underground Railroaders snatched free blacks from the North and sent them south during the 1800s.  KKK activity seems to thrive along the line, even up through recent times.  For whites who are under the impression that civil rights and equality were successfully achieved by blacks either after the Civil War or in the mid-1960s, the accounts relayed here may be disturbing to read.  Jarring, but necessary.  Black and white photos of people, buildings, and places add much to the text, and the map at the end of the book is a handy resource to consult.  Though Ecenbarger seems to have a fascination with more of the negative stories than the positive (i.e., while he mentions Mercersburg, Penna., he doesn't note that PA's only president, James Buchanan, was born there), this book remains a real eye-opener to those of us who resided nearby and never knew the truth.	2001-10-19

The student, academically rated in the top 10% of his class, stared blankly back at me.  &quot;Mason and Dixon?&quot; I asked.  Nothing.  &quot;The Mason-Dixon Line?&quot;  Nada.  &quot;The border between Pennsylvania and Maryland?  The boundary between The North and The South?  The whole premise behind the Civil War?&quot;  Nope.  He had never heard of it.  The Line, I mean; of course, he knew about the Civil War.<br />Maybe I took it for granted, since I grew up in a suburb about 25 miles north of the Line, in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.  The Line was there, but nobody made a big deal about it.  I don't recall being taught anything about it, myself.  I made a mental note to someday rectify that omission.<br />When Thomas Pynchon's _Mason &amp; Dixon_ was released, I was ready and interested.  Ready and interested, that is, until I spied a copy in a bookstore, randomly opened it, and tried to actually read and understand the words on that single page.  Hmmm.  I returned the book to its display and allowed it to entice another potential buyer.<br />As soon as Danson's book came out, I was ready and interested in the subject matter once again.  And I believe I made the right choice with this one.  There's A LOT of trigonometry and technical information in parts, and all of the math teachers in my past wouldn't be a bit surprised that I sort of skimmed over those paragraphs.  But the extent of the politics and 18th-century science involved is intriguing.  Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon had to contend with scientific authorities and governmental offices on both sides of the Atlantic -- not to mention local hostilities between European settlers and native Indians.  In spite of a variety of challenges, they were ultimately successful in their mission and got little recognition (and even less pay) for their hard work in the colonial wilderness.<br />My favorite passages in _Drawing the Line_ were in the details surrounding the actual surveying of the PA-MD border, which had to be done in four separate phases.  I followed the text along with a road atlas in my lap and could envision some of the familiar terrain.  And I nodded at the descriptions of violent thunderstorms and crippling blizzards.  Been there, done that ... though certainly not while living in a surveyor's tent.<br />Reading this book will help to answer the inevitable teenager lament, &quot;When would ANYONE ever use trigonometry in real life?&quot;  And if you have a hankering to know more about life on the North American East Coast before the Revolution, here's a way to experience it without getting cold and wet.

The volume is arranged by geographic region, beginning in New England. The entry for each site includes photos and notes on architectural style, interior design, how long the author stayed there, who visited him/her, and what works were written there. A handful of authors are treated twice -- for example, Mark Twain is found in both Connecticut and Missouri, Edgar Allan Poe in both New York and Philadelphia, and Ernest Hemingway in both Florida and Illinois. True to the _Ideals_ layout style, the photos chosen are indeed lovely. One detraction is that the actual addresses, contact information, and driving directions are found in a separate section at the back of the book. A second possible problem is that the glued paperback binding might not stand up to repeated consultations during a long trip.

It's the same deal with Betsy Devonshire of Excelsior, Minnesota. After she inherits her sister's needlecraft store, Crewel World, she finds herself getting involved in the investigation of several local murders. And she ends up solving the mysteries. (see _Crewel World_, _Framed in Lace_, and _A Stitch in Time_) And even though Betsy is a newcomer to Excelsior, people are starting to turn to her in expectation of her quick work at locating criminals. The local police chief is still a bit leery of her ideas and techniques, but Betsy has conveniently befriended a female cop named Jill who can offer official help and insight. It works.<br />In this fourth episode, however, Betsy and Jill have ventured far afield to attend a Stitch-In in Naniboujou, Minnesota, along the Lake Superior shoreline. When the key speaker doesn't show up, both women become suspicious and start nosing around, and eventually they are the ones who find the body. Now, if you've read the other mysteries in this series, you shouldn't mind Betsy asking a lot of questions and following her conclusions. But if this is the first Monica Ferris book you pick up, I think Betsy might rub you the wrong way. You might think she's a butt-in-ski who has no business investigating a murder which shouldn't concern her. You might think it's pretentious of her to walk into an unfamiliar hotel and start asking questions. You might think it's a gutsy move to confront the victim's children and ex-husband with pointed accusations. And you'd be right, sort of. But read one of the other volumes first. You'll like Betsy a lot better, and you'll have more tolerance for her style.<br />I read all four of the Needlecraft Mysteries in one weekend and am ready for some more. Fans of this series would like Earlene Fowler's Benni Harper mysteries as well.	2001-08-29

Bean (Mentor Series)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	...and I'm not even a customer	Not an award-winner as a biography or even as a corporate history, but a worthwhile read all the same.  I picked up a copy on a whim at a used bookstore and was pleasantly intrigued enough to finish the whole thing.  Uncovered here are the habits and quirks of Leon Leonwood Bean, his stereotypical New England lifestyle and business philosophies, and the challenges the mail-order company faced from his death in 1966 to the time of this publication in 1985.  The most surprising -- and yet somehow, not totally unexpected -- fact that the reader takes away is the contradiction of the company mystique and the demographics of its typical customer.  It's rural Maine versus East and West Coast suburbia.  Wearers of the Maine Hunting Shoe or the chamois cloth shirt are more comfortable hunting for their kids on the soccer field sidelines or fishing for compliments at the local country club watering hole.  And their buying habits changed not only their status quo but also the daily life of residents of Freeport, Maine.  Marketing students may therefore find the latter chapters more interesting than the beginning biographical ones.  Maybe one of them will continue the study and write an up-to-date version of it, since L.L. Bean, Inc. is obviously still finding ways to survive.	2001-08-07

And after the technical descriptions comes the neat stuff:  how the flowers were named, and/or stories about the uses early settlers and native peoples had for the plant.  People are interested in details like that, and most guidebooks don't include them.  Not only do they give us a more personal connection to another species, but knowing such information makes it easier to remember and identify the flower.  Naturalists and volunteer nature trail leaders should try to snag a copy of this book for their reference shelves.  Just make sure to mark it so that it doesn't get permanently &quot;borrowed&quot; by a colleague!	2001-06-30

Reading professional journals, taking graduate courses, and networking with colleagues are the ways most teachers find out how to refine their techniques.  Andrea Fishman did it differently.  In the early 1980s, she got a chance to visit a one-room Old Order Amish and Mennonite schoolhouse for a semester as part of her doctoral work.  The resulting book details her ethnographic study and the changes she herself made in her own English courses upon her return to the classroom.<br />You need not know a lot about Amish society before opening these pages, because you'll quickly learn about the demands that special community has on an individual's life.  And even if you were raised in the &quot;Amish country&quot; of central Pennsylvania like I was, you may still find some surprises here.  Reading and writing are important parts of daily life for Amish people.  They read a variety of books and magazines and write letters and newspaper account about their congregations' activities.  Even if you're not a teacher, you can catch intriguing glimpses here.  One example is the circle letter, where each recipient writes an entire page about himself/herself, then sends it on to the next person in an eventual circle of friends.  Whenever the letter returns to the originator, he/she removes the previously written page and writes another...after reading everyone else's pages, of course.<br />Though the one-room schoolhouse environment has some merit to it, Fishman is far from saying that we should return to it.  Some things she saw mirrored her own practices so much that she questioned their relevance in a more contemporary and diverse classroom.  Some lessons were better; some seemed to stiffle student individualism -- but then again, the scholars and their teacher had to answer to their deeply-ingrained religious background.<br />Though published in the 1980s, this book still has ideas to offer to contemporary teachers interested in perking up their kids' literacy.  At the very least, it'll make them think.chers interested in perking up their kids' literacy.  At the very least, it'll make them think.	2001-06-30

Emblidge dovetails selections by well-known naturalists and writers with those of AT through- and dayhikers to create a unique collection of observations.  Some, like Thoreau, found themselves in the neighborhood of the path before it was even created.  You can follow the history of the trail, beginning with Benton MacKaye's first written public proposal in 1921.  Then the pieces mark an imaginary trip north from Springer Mountain to Mount Katahdin.  Simple maps and b&amp;w photos are included.  It's not Bill Bryson's _A Walk in the Woods_, but then, what is?

But it includes historical background about the Mennonites from their beginnings in Switzerland and the German Palatinate through their immigrations to North America in the early 1700s.  Aspects of typical daily life are detailed as well, such as building construction techniques, farming, furnishings, foods and cooking procedures, tools, and religious practices.  Even though the rooms can be imagined by reading the descriptions and studying the color photos, a floor plan would have helped those readers who haven't yet visited the house.  Still, anyone with Mennonite or Pennsylvania German roots should probably read this slim volume someday.<br />One chapter follows the ownership of the property, which remained in the hands of Herr descendants until 1969, when the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society was able to acquire it.  There was plenty of work to do; the structure had been unoccupied for more than a century.  Restoration even included matching the existing mortar with a mixture of cow manure and yeast!  Through the work of the society and many hours of volunteer labor, the site is now on the National Register and offers tours and educational programs.  You can visit it on the web at ...	2001-06-19

This book provides biographical information as well as a behind-the-scenes look at the activities of the Warner Brothers studio.  Readers will learn how the individual voices were created and will even see photos of Mel &quot;portraying&quot; the character as he talks.  One of the biggest secrets of all was that he disliked carrots.  He'd chew on them while recording Bug's lines, but the recording would have to stop while Mel spit out the remains into a wastebasket.<br />If you're a true fan of Bugs, Elmer, Porky, Daffy, Sylvester, Pepe Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, and all the rest, pick up a copy of _Chuck Amuck_ when you're finished here.  You'll discover more about Warner Brothers from cartoonist Chuck Jones in that volume.  And if you can, scarf around and find _Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies:  a complete illustrated guide to the Warner Brothers cartoons_ by Jerry Beck and Will Friedwald.

The words can be insightful and melodious.  Canada geese &quot;migrate, not flitting from hedge to hedge, but from latitude to latitude, from State to State, steering boldly out into the ocean of air.&quot;  Perhaps the most interesting passages are those of additional historic importance: his dated sightings of the passenger pigeons (or as Thoreau calls them, &quot;wild pigeons&quot;) that were plentiful in New England in the mid-1800s but are now extinct.  &quot;I frequently see pigeons dashing about in small flocks, or three or four at a time, over the woods here,&quot; he wrote on May 7, 1859.  Details are not for the squeamish, however.  Henry lived in a time when hunting was not limited to game animals, and dead bodies were often brought to him for identification or examination.  And he wrote about what he saw.  Nevertheless, if you like Thoreau, or if you're a birder with a life list, you'll appreciate this book.	2001-06-16

Here the reader will learn, in a casual and sometimes humorous way, the history of the Prairie State, what rocks and minerals it holds, and prevailing overall, how the glaciers impacted North American terrain during the Ice Age. Because the book proceeds regionally from north to south, natives and tourists alike can follow along by car or on foot. But even if you never visit Illinois, there are juicy tidbits for you to chew on and be surprised by. Like the fact that Illinois is NOT flat. Like the bizarre origins of the Streeterville neighborhood, which was created in the 1880s only after George \\"Cap\\" Streeter grounded a ship along the Lake Michigan shoreline and encouraged construction waste to be dumped around it to form a landfill. Or what happened to the Amoco Building when its pricey Italian-quarried marble sides were exposed to the extremes of Chicago weather. Or the fact that the kitty litter capital of the world may very well be located in the southern tip of the state. Sadly, the black and white photos chosen to accompany the text miss the mark in capturing the true beauty of the sites. You'll simply have to see the places in person.<br />The author continues to make numerous appearances at nature centers and society meetings throughout Illinois. His presentation style in likable, informative, and funny, and audience members walk away knowing more about geology than they would have guessed possible. If you get a chance to see him speak, take it. You'll find the time well spent.  [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]	2001-06-15

When our nature book discussion group chose it as a monthly selection several years ago, we had to scramble to find copies.  I was one of the lucky ones who got one, read it all, and underlined a whole slew of passages for later reference.<br />Here are some of my favorite quotes:<br />&quot;Man is everywhere a disturbing agent.  Wherever he plants his foot, the harmonies of nature are turned to discords.&quot;  (George Perkins Marsh, 1864)<br />&quot;Environment is to the would-be cultured man what air is to the animal -- it is the breath of life.&quot;  (Benton MacKaye, 1928)<br />&quot;When you have reached the edge of an abyss ... the only progressive move you can make is to step backward.&quot;  (David R. Brower, 1977)<br />Then the compiler adds his answer to the question &quot;Why do we love wilderness?&quot; by giving seven reasons:  scientific value, spiritual values, aesthetic value, heritage value, psychological value, cultural value, and intrinsic value.  His explanations make this selection the one I most often pass on to other people. (Roderick Frazier Nash, 1988)<br />My advice is to buy this book as a present for your favorite environmentalist friend.  Sure, you could go instead with _The Quotable Nature Lover_, a Nature Conservancy book edited by John A. Murray.  But _American Environmentalism_ puts those kinds of quotes back into context; the editor not only provides full text but also explains what was going on at the time of its writing.  Selections are arranged chronologically and are short enough to hold anyone's interest.  And we're not talking just Thoreau, Muir, Carson and Leopold here, as the excerpts above show.  There are names you might not recognize at first glance.  Amateur environmentalists can use this compilation as a starting point for further reading, as full citations are always provided.  Though it's not entirely current (1989) this book is still useful.<br />Give it to a graduating senior, or to anyone else who has the potential to save the planet.

First, read one of his own works -- like _My First Summer in the Sierra_ -- and then proceed to a tribute like _The Pathless Way: John Muir and American Wilderness_ by Michael P. Cohen.<br />Finish those two, and then you'll have the background information needed to appreciate _The Heart of John Muir's World_.  The author obviously read a ton of correspondence to and from Muir family members and friends in order to glean insights into the lives of everyone close to John, as well as John himself.  You'll find details here not common to other biographies, with a particular focus to the lifestyle the Muirs made for themselves in central Wisconsin.  You'll realize how close the Muir brothers and sisters were, in spite of eventually settling in as varied locations as Virginia, Kansas, Nebraska, and California.  You'll understand how all of them held an appreciation of nature beginning with the time that they grew up and worked on the family farm -- and that John's ideas about preserving wild areas began right there, too.  On three different occasions during his lifetime, John looked into buying and setting aside part of the Wisconsin landscape that he loved, so that it could be enjoyed by others as he had seen it as a child.  But either the deals fell through, or the current owners refused to sell.  In spite of those setbacks, a small John Muir Memorial Park now stands in Marquette County, Wisconsin, while John's larger contribution to us and to future generations is half a continent away, in Yosemite National Park.<br />If you're not content with simply knowing that he was a naturalist, the founder of the Sierra Club, and a major instigator for the creation of the U.S. National Parks system, you'll find more about John Muir's day-to-day world in this book.  And when you finish, you will understand that the subtitle &quot;Wisconsin, Family, and Wilderness Discovery&quot; refers to the three great loves of his life.reat loves of his life.	2001-06-14

So if you haven't yet ventured into Benni's life -- if you don't know anything about San Celina, California, or about its folk art museum or its police department or about Southern roots running deep in the life of a 30-something woman and her father and grandmother -- _Arkansas Traveler_ might be a nice place to start.  When Benni and her cousin Emory return to Sugartree, Arkansas, for a big church reunion (with their Hispanic partners by their sides), they find out that racism still lingers under the small-town surface and that the Civil War isn't quite over.  The black Baptist church and the white Baptist church in town are considering a merger but run into a few stumbling blocks along the way.  A black woman and childhood friend to Benni and Emory is challenging a white male incumbant in a local mayoral election.  Blood pressures are already being pushed to their near-limits when a young white man is murdered and fingers are pointed to a young black counterpart.  And Benni's inclination is to ask questions and find out the truth, and her inquisitiveness can only lead to possible danger, of course.<br />Food plays a major role in this offering, and I'm happy to say that when I finished the book, I walked to our local Dairy Queen and bought a cone in honor of Benni, Gabe, Elvia, and Emory.  Aw heck, I did it for myself as well.  Enjoy the reading!	2001-05-06

We then follow &quot;True Sport&quot; from Jack's hand -- and a flooded course creek -- to an eventual home with Kentucky caddy Billy Prescott at the turn of the century. The story is told in reflective manner by Billy's grandson John and takes its own unexpected turns.<br />Though this self-published novel would have benefitted from tighter editing and more stringent proofreading, the plot is intriguing and has its suspenseful moments. In _Field of Dreams_ / _Shoeless Joe_ fashion, the reader is never really sure what might be truth and what might be fiction. If &quot;True Sport&quot; were made into a screenplay, the result would combine _Tin Cup_ and _The Legend of Bagger Vance_, with a little _Caddy Shack_ thrown in for good measure. This book should appeal first to golfers and fans of the sport, and secondly to those looking for an entertaining light read.	2001-03-06

I also saw at least 11 spelling or grammatical errors; mis- or non-uses of dashes, hyphens, quotes, and question marks became too numerous to make note of.  It's surprising that a commercial publisher can let that much slip by these days.  For the reputation of the author, I sincerely hope the glitches are corrected if this title goes to paperback or to an additional printing.	2000-12-28

The book &quot;Shoeless Joe,&quot; on the other hand, provides more food for thought and additional storylines.  If you simply see the movie, you'll miss out on meeting Kid Scissons, the oldest living Chicago Cub, who rented his farm to Ray and Annie.  You won't know that Ray has a twin brother Richard who left home at 15, never to be seen or heard from again, until the time that Ray built his baseball field.  And though there are times when the novel's characters share the same script with their movie counterparts, there are many more instances when they don't.<br />If you are the kind of person who has to watch &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; at least once a year, then you should jump back a step and read &quot;Shoeless Joe.&quot;  Better yet, you should make the trip to Dyersville, Iowa, where the field and the farmhouse still exist and look just as they did in the movie.  If you can stand on that baseball field without any emotion or without a chill moving along your spine, then someone better check your pulse.	2000-12-02

Stephen King's autobiographical handbook on the craft is both entertaining and informative, especially to those of us who aspire to be novelists.  I'm probably one of the very few people on the planet who until yesterday had *never* read a Stephen King book, and I polished this one off in a single day.  Now I might have to go back and read some of his fiction just to see his writing patterns in action.  King's familiar tone here sounds a lot like a column his buddy Dave Barry would write, and why shouldn't it?  He can even talk about the 1999 car accident in a reflective manner.<br />The most helpful tips about writing and editing I picked up from this book are: (a) avoid using adverbs at all costs, and (b) let a finished book manuscript sit in a drawer for 6 weeks before going back to edit it.  I'll keep both ideas in mind as I finish writing my own novel.  Thanks for the guidance, Stephen.

This slim volume should appeal to a variety of folks -- from couch potatoes, to occasional vacationers who pile the kids into the SUV once a summer, and especially to those 'pavement adventurers' among us who travel  the interstates often.  No matter what part of the country you live in,  Larry McMurtry is apt to have driven through it and written at least a few  sentences about it.  I was fortunate enough to pick up this book just as I  was returning from a 10-day drive through seven states, and I thoroughly  enjoyed reading about stretches of road that I had just covered myself.  At  the same time that he shares his geographical experiences, McMurtry also  teaches you about the literature of that area -- books either ABOUT the  place, or BY the authors who live(d) in it.  What a nice surprise!  This  approach makes &quot;Roads&quot; a nice gift for travelers or simply for  avid readers as well.

I'm originally from Lancaster County and thus grew up knowing a fair amount about the Amish lifestyle.  This series (&quot;The Shunning,&quot; &quot;The Confession,&quot; and &quot;The Reckoning&quot;) weaves an  intriguing plot and can enlighten readers about a culture that is part of  our society and yet deliberately separate from it at the same time.  For  that element, I highly recommend these books.<br />However, the change of  setting for part of the story bothers me. I visit Canandaigua, New York,  several times a year, and it's a truly wonderful place.  I was initially  surprised and pleased that Beverly Lewis chose to have Katie / Katherine  move to that area.  But why use a real city without revealing the unique  personality of the place?  None of Lewis' characters ever mention the fact  that Canandaigua sits at the northern tip of one of the Finger Lakes.  The  lake is large, noticeable, a tourist attraction, and comes up in local  conversation at least once every few days, even if you can't see it from  your house.  Even during wintertime -- which is when Katie / Katherine  lives there in &quot;The Confession&quot; -- people talk about whether or  not the lake is frozen over.  Certainly an Amish woman with a farming  background would wonder about the presence of sea gulls around her new  home.  And she probably would be astounded by the size of Canandaigua's  Main Street, which has a wide grass median down the middle of it and  doesn't look anything like Lancaster, Pa., or any town she would have seen  before. (For those of us who watch TV and movies, the street resembles the  Bedford Falls of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life,&quot; but of course, Katie  wouldn't know about that.)  Perhaps Lewis should have created a  ficticious city in western New York, instead of doing an injustice to an  existing one.	2000-06-07

When a library board member is murdered outside the mission, Miss  Zukas is quick (once again) to help police in their investigation ... while  a prior public disagreement with the victim places her in criminal  suspicion as well.  If you've read any of the other titles in this series,  you'll enjoy following the continuing sagas of:  the weather in Bellehaven;  the bizarre antics of Ruth, Helma's artist friend; and the glowing embers  of the quasi-platonic relationship with Wayne Gallant, the city police  chief.  And those of us in the library profession can easily identify with  many of the quirks of the library staff and patrons.  &quot;Miss Zukas in  Death's Shadow&quot; is a quick and delightful read, and you might not  figure out who the murderer is until just before Miss Zukas does!	2000-06-05

If you are an animal-lover of any kind, you MUST read this book.  If the notion of nature and wilderness and Alaskan beauty and utter aloneness intrigue you -- but not enough to  run the race yourself -- you MUST read this book.  For the thousands of us  who will see the Iditarod only through Gary Paulsen's eyes, I say thank  you, Gary, for a terrific and emotional ride.	1999-11-28

I just finished reading this book during a subzero Midwestern winter, and I believe that was the best time to read it.  The cold leaps off the pages and gets into your bones, just like it does to the characters  in the book.  You're reading along very nicely, understanding the plot and  the players in it, when WHAM!  A startling announcement at a community  meeting throws you a curve.  An old man and a little girl are lost in the  woods.  And suddenly you're on a literary roller coaster, flying toward the  conclusion of the novel, unable to do anything but finish the darn book.  It's great!  Now I have to go read the other two episodes in the series.	1999-01-10

Shame on you, if you're a school or public librarian and haven't yet devoured these Helma Zukas murder mysteries!  The plots become even merrier with every fun-poking gibe at current librarianship.  In &quot;Final  Notice,&quot; Helma's aunt takes center stage as she visits Bellehaven from  her native Michigan.  Murder and intrigue come with her, and it's up to  Helma (as usual) to decipher who the culprit is before he/she can wreak  more havoc.  The running romantic sub-plot between the librarian and police  chief Wayne Gallant is a continuing saga with subtle nuances that reflect  real life experiences.  These books can be enjoyed by ANY mystery lover,  and not just those of us in the book-loaning trade.	1998-10-28
