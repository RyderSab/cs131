I found where at one time I looked forward with anticipation to each new release, I was now feeling obligated to read each new effort with little joy.<BR> One Door Away From Heaven is a welcome return to Koontz's earlier more engaging writing.  The characters are well drawn and engaging(although as is the case in most of his books children and canines are far too adult). While the book starts off slow it begins to pick up steam and by the end you will find that you don't want to put it down.  At times Koontz gets a little too preachy and practically hits you over the head with his message, but at least he has a message to get across.  With recent novels you had gotten the feeling that this was an author with nothing left to say.  With One Door Away From Heaven Koontz shows he still has a story or two to tell.	2002-01-02

He has managed to take a subject that is controversal and complex and turn it into an amazingly compelling novel.  I disagree with those reviewers that have stated that Patterson sides only with those characters that support abortion.  Patterson does a great job of presenting both sides of the debate while walking a tight rope between facts and preaching.  He never crosses over that line and he manages to engage the reader with yet another well constructed legal/political thriller.  The characters are well drawn and the many sub-plots as always ultimately come together to a very satisfying conclusion.  This book is the very definition of a must read.  Don't miss it.	2001-01-09

Caleb Carr is one of those authors.  Killing Time is a nice change of pace for Carr who previuosly has set his novels in the past.  Killing Time is set in the future, but the historical elements that always mark Carr's books are there.  The story reads very much like an H.G. Wells or Jules Vern novel, yet it is still original enough to really grab you.  Any fan of Caleb Carr will enjoy this book and hopefully others will give him a try.	2000-11-14

They are shorter books than her usual fare and I guess they are marketed as great stocking stuffers.  Lately, I have found myself enjoying Clark's books less and less.  They have become much too predictable and at best can be described as &quot;lite&quot; thrillers.  If this type of book appeals to you, you will enjoy Deck The Halls.  Loyal fans of Clark's work will find the usual elements that attract them to her books.  For those readers looking for something fresh and exciting, this book is not for you.  I have never read any of the books written by her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark(who she cowrote this book with), so I have no point of comparison on her end.  I will say that reading Deck The Halls does not inspire to go out and read any of Carol's other work.  This is not an awful book, it's just not an interesting one.  Any mystery and thriller fan will be able to predict all the action in this book by the time they've reached page fifty.  I realize that is actually a positive characteristic for avid Mary Higgins Clark fans.  The familiarity of both the plot and characters is attractive to these fans and the formula will produce another New York Times Bestseller.  For those who have never read Clark before this is not the place to start. Go back to one of her earlier works when her plots seemed fresh and new.  A true Christmas present from Clark would be to write a book as good as those early ones.  These books are an annual tradition I could live without.	2000-10-24

I also really enjoyed The Devil's Teardrop which did not feature the Rhyme character.  Speaking In Tongues falls into this latter category.  As far as I can tell it is a reissue of a novel that was actually released a few years ago and is being reisssued to capitalize on Deaver's recent surge in popularity.  The premise of the book is interesting, unfortunately some of the plot points require such a suspense of reality that it detracts from the enjoyment of the book.  The characters lack the dimension that Deaver usually provides and many times seem too cartoonish.  Any fan of the suspense genre will not be surprised by any of the action.  In other words we have seen this type of thing before and the writing is not engaging enough to make us forget it.  If you are a fan of Deaver's work you will probably get some enjoyment out of this book, however I would suggest waiting for the paperback.  I got to read and advance copy, but if I had paid over twenty dollars for the hard cover I know I would feel cheated.	2000-10-20

Easy Prey which was released earlier this year was by far the worst book yet.  That is why I was amazed to hear that Sandford was releasing another book so soon. I was expecting the worst.  However, I was pleasently surprised to learn that The Devil's Code was actually the third Kidd and Luellen book.  I grant you that this one was not as good as the first two(The Fool's Run and The Empress File) but it was still enjoyable.  This kind of book is exactly the kind of change of pace that all authors who write a series should write.  I agree with some of the other reviews that Lucas Davenport is a better character, but let's be honest have any of the recent Prey novels come even close to some of the earliest books like Rules Of Prey and Eyes of Prey?  Take this book for what it is, a very good departure form a great author.  The plot drags at some points but overall it is an interesting suspense story.  Now let's hope Sandford breaths some life into that other series or we all be hoping for more Kidd novels instead.	2000-10-17

Her last effort Black Notice, was without question the worst entry in the series.  This book is a nice bounce back, but it doesn't quite live up to the potential it shows at first.  After the first few chapters of The Last Precinct, I was convinced that Cornwell was going to reinvent Kay and take a new and fresh approach to the series.  Unfortunatley, the soul searching that Scarpetta goes through in the first few chapters does not lead to the resounding change I was hoping for.  Yes, it does seem that Cornwell is going to shake things up a bit just not as much as I hoped.  The plot of this book picks up right were Black Notice left off.  Somehow, the plot that seemed unrealistic and contrived in the previous book actually picks up some life.  It almost feels like Cornwell recognizes how badly conceived Black Notice's plot was and is using this book to flesh it out. Being a fan of Cornwell's work, I really wanted to like this book, and I have to say that I did.  It is an improvement over the last couple of efforts.  However, it is still not as good as the earliest entries in this series and if this plot was connected with a book that was not part of a series that I liked, I'm not so sure that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did.  If you have never read a Kay Scarpetta book before, do not start with this one.  If you are a Cornwell fan that vowed you would never read her again after Black Notice, give her another try.  The Last Precinct could be a fresh start for Kay Scarpetta, let's hope it continues.	2000-10-16

For some reason this does not come across as conceit.  Jeter is a truly likeable individual and I think it is great that he has written a book that can serve as an inspiration for teens and young adults.  So many of the sports stars out there today are horrific role models for today's youth. Jeter stands on his own as a respectful athlete who has not squandered his immense talent.  That being said, while this book is a must read for any sports fan under the age of eighteen I do not believe that adults will feel the same way.  I am a Yankee fan so I was able to find enjoyment from Jeter's stories about the great championship seasons of recent years.  However, others will probably find the story telling a little too simplistic. If you are looking for a tell all book about his relationship with Maria Carey you will not find it here.  If you are looking for a great gift to give to a young aspiring sports fan, this book is perfect.	2000-10-13

If Maury Allen wanted to write a book that provided an overview of his prolific sports writing career I'm sure that there would have been many interested readers.  However, he has chosen to write that book and disguise it as a book about the Yankees.  Sure, the focus of the book for the most part is on the Yankees, but Allen presents little that the average Yankee fan has not already seen.  He also interrupts the narration on the Yankees with stories from his personal experiences that have nothing to do with the Yankees.  There are no insights here for Yankee fans, which would be fine if he didn't promise a book about George Steinbrenner's years of ownership with the Yankees.  Don't waste your time with this book.	2000-10-13

It is a well written and gripping read.  Grisham's recent books have started to feel formulatic and predictable.  This book is exciting and is truly a page turner.  It will entertain you and make you think at the same time.  If you have read a more recent Grisham book and disliked it give this one a try.  It really is a great book.	2000-10-11

However, some of the most recent installments in the series have proven to be somewhat weak efforts.  M is for Malice is an example of these weaker efforts.  The mystery just never hooks you and if you have never read Grafton before you will find little to catch your interest.  Some of the earliest books in the series were among the best mysteries I have ever read.  The last couple of books have fallen way short of that.

The book itself was actually released over forty years ago but for the most part the story ages well.  Cop Hater was the first book in the classic series and it moves along at a quick and rapid pace.  A little too quick and rapid for my tastes.  Fans of the series will be overjoyed at the chance to relive this early book but for those of us who are reading McBain for the first time Cop Hater is just an average read.  There are some flashes of great writing but over all this book did not engage me.  Good interseting read but not great.	2000-10-10

Even though it has been many years since Parcells has left the Giants I have still followed his career closely.  I even found myself routing for the crosstown rivals when he became the Jets head coach.  Parcells does a good job conveying the ups and downs of his last season as an NFL coach and he adds enough insight to his years with the Giants and Patriots to make this book intersting to fans of both of these teams.  The Final Season just wasn't interesting enough to be a great book. Don't get me wrong it was a good read just not a great one.  Jet fans will probably love this book and Giant Fans will like it.  However, the average football fan will not find enough here to hold their interest.  Wait for the paperback.	2000-10-09

What surprised me was just how good this book was.  It provides valuable insight not only into the mind of King but on the writing process itself.  You will find yourself inspired to actually sit down at the computer yourself and finally put down those ideas that have been floating around in your head.  However, King does make it clear that writing is a serious job and that it is not for anyone.  His insight into the business side of the craft will prove to be valuable to any aspiring writer.  I always enjoy the &quot;note to the reader&quot; section that King often includes in his novels.  On Writing reads like one long &quot;note to the reader&quot; and is often funny and at other times quite touching.  King is amazingly honest about his own troubles and faults and the section of the book detailing his accident and road to recovery are inspiring.  Most of all the best thing about this book is that King's love of writing, reading and all things about books comes shining through.  What an amazing man.	2000-09-29

Patterson is one of them.  Each of his books are similar in theme, yet the story seems fresh each time.  Dark Lady is no different.  I am always fascinated with Patterson's ability to weave events of the past with their impact on the present.  Each of his characters is so well defined that we understand the reasons behind every move they make.  What makes Dark Lady so great is that it is not only an amazing character study, but a fantastic mystery as well.  Dark Lady may not be Patterson's best book(that title will probably always belong to Degree of Guilt) but it is an amazing read.  I am surprised by some of the other reviews I have read about this book that describe it as slow and boring.  I found it tense and absorbing and I was riveted starting on page one all the way to the great conclusion.  Read this book and all books by Richard North Patterson.	2000-09-28

This book flows so well and is so well constructed you would never guess that it is not one man writing it.  This book is not for the faint of heart.  If violence disturbs you, Headhunter is not for you. If you look past the intense violence you will find a great who-done-it mystery.  The book starts slow, but after the first hundred pages it takes off and you can't put it down.  The ending is a shocker, but you don't feel cheated.  I cant't wait to read more books in the Slade series.	2000-09-27

While this book is not a return to the greatness of the earlier Alex Delaware novels, at least it's a step in the right direction.  If not for a completely unrealistic ending, I would be giving this book four stars.  Kellerman does a great job of building up the mystery and unfortunately the payoff falls flat.

It of course helps to be a fan of the show and if you consider yourself a Survivor addict this book is a must-read.  My main complaint is the price.  For the amount of money they are charging for a trade paperback, you should get more book.  Maybe Mark Burnett would have been better served, if he had taken his time and done a better book, instead of trying to cash in quickly.

When I began to realize that King was going to spend  the majority of Wizard and Glass telling us about Roland's back story I  started to get disappointed.  That feeling quickly dissapeared.  Wizard and  Glass stands as a great story on it's own, one that can be enjoyed without  having read the three previous novels in the series.

Although I have noticed that all of the other reviewers of this book have  described the plot in detail, I will not.  Part of the excitement of this  book is watching the plot unfold and any decription will lessen that  effect.  This book is an exciting read and is actually quite scary at  times.

While I am a fan of Dean  Koontz's work, I found Fear Nothing to be one of his worst books.  Luckily,  a reader can read Seize The Night without having to waste their time with  Fear Nothing.  This book was a vast improvement and if not for a weak  ending I would rate it with four stars.  Someone needs to tell Koontz that  not all endings need to be happy.  Especially if you have created a  fantastic mood of dread and suspense in the first 300 pages of the book.   Overall, this is an enjoyable read.  If the trend of improvement continues  the third book in this proposed trilogy will be a great one.	2000-08-23

I find Ebert to be extremely knowledgable in  the areas of film and film making.  I also find him very funny when I have  seen him interviewed.  He has a dry wit and he is not afraid to say what he  feels about a movie.  When I heard that he would be coming out with a book  about movies that he hated, I was extremely excited.  It seemed like the  perfect forum for Ebert to show off both his knowledge and his humor.   Unfortunatley all this book offers is a reprinting of the reviews that  Ebert originally wrote, arranged in alphabetical order.  I wish Ebert had  picked about a dozen of these movies and devoted a chapter to each and  given an in depth account of each movie. Not only a description but an  analysis of what went wrong in the making of each.  Like a car wreck we  can't help but be curious about these &quot;accidents&quot;, and someone  with as much knowledge as Ebert could have offered an &quot;insiders&quot;  guide to how movies as bad as these get made.  For a great book on this  topic read The Devil's Candy by Julie Soloman.  It is a great account of  the making of the film version of Bonfire Of The Vanities(how Hollywood  took a great book and turned it into an unbelievably bad movie). The  reviews that are offered here are interesting and at times even hilarious.   I just wish Ebert had put more effort into a great idea.  Anyone could have  given us this book, Ebert could have given us better.	2000-08-23

I honestly  don't think that King has ever written a &quot;bad&quot; book.  Some may be  better than others, but even at his weakest King is better than 95% of the  popular writers out there today. The Dark Half is King at his best.  A  truly sacry book that delivers a message at the same time.  You don't have  to be a Literature major to analyze the point King is trying to make here  about the writing process, but that does not make it any less clever.  I  think that The Dark Half has gone under rated because it was released at a  time when King's domination of The Bestseller Lists was starting to peak.   Do yourself a favor don't miss out on this great book. You will not be  disapointed.	2000-08-22

Unfortunately, many times  I find his writing to be uneven.  One book will blow me away, and the next  will have me vowing that I will never read one of his books again.  Fear  Nothing falls into the latter category.  This book is just too boring and  predictable.  If this had been my first time reading Koontz, I'm not so  sure there would have been a second time.  If you want to read a Dean  Koontz book try Phantoms or Whispers.  Only after reading one of those far  superior books will you be able to forgive Koontz for this one.

Unfortunately in the end, that was my  problem with the book.  It was just like Hoag only not as well written.   The characters were cartoonish and I kept waiting for a plot twist that  never happened.  Putting those complaints aside, A Perfect Evil was an  entertaining read and I beleive that Kava shows potential for the future.   Let's hope that she finds a voice of her own, and in the meantime wait for  the paperback.  Even better, buy Tami Haog's Night Sins or Guilty as Sin.   Those are two mid-western suspense novels that are truly great.	2000-08-18

That is a  real crime because there are many writers that are better, among those,   Richard North Patterson stands as the best.  Degree Of Guilt is Patterson's  best book and it will litterally blow you away.  The characters are written  realistcally and the plot is complex but not confusing.  Once you start  this book you will never want to put it down until you reach it's  shattering conclusion.  Forget Grisham do yourself a real favor and try  Patterson, you will not be dissapointed.	2000-08-18

To say Along Came A Spider is an  exciting book would be an understatement.  The suspense is amazing, the  characters are great(especially the villain) and the plot twists are  unexpected.  This first installment in the Alex Cross series still remains  the best.  James Patterson really knows how to grab a reader and not let  go.  Along Came a Spider will turn you into an instant Patterson fan.	2000-08-18
US	50212508	R2CR3QDEKOKKNB	0375502548	684734174	Omerta (Godfather, Book 3)	Books	3	6	6	N	N	A Quick and Dissapointing Read	I was thrilled to learn that we would get to read one last book by the great Mario Puzo.  Unfortunately by the time I was done I almost wished that The Last Don had remained as the book that capped Puzo's career.   Omerta reads more like an outline for a movie than a novel and the  characters, while interesting, are painfully underdeveloped.  It would be  unfair to compare this book with The Godfather, so I won't bother, but even  taken on it's own merits, Omerta can only be decribed as a dissapointment.   It is a great story with great potential that is not met.  Wait for the  paperback.	2000-07-31
