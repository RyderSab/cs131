All the fundamentals of optics and lens design are explained in detail. Any serious photographer should read this book. They will understand the limitations of their non-Leica systems and be in an informative position to decide if they need the ultimate picture recording potential of Leica lenses. Until now, I was using a Nikon F4 with the 17-35 2.8 ED. The author has informed me that he tried the lens, along with the Zeiss (Contax) 17-35 2.8 and neither approach the capabilities of similar leica zooms. Is he crazy? Read this volume and you will understand why no system can match the build, optics and design of Leica. Most important, you will see that the way most lens tests are done in today's photo magazines are not worth much at all.<BR>Keep in mind, this is not a stunning picture book. Color photos are kept to an extreme minimum and are only used to make some point about optical capabilities of certain lenses. This book will no doubt serve as the ultimate leica lens buyer's guide. But remember, it is much more than that and Puts is one of the few people who can articulate lens performance into a fun and informative read. <BR>A soft cover version would be nice for those who can't afford the hard cover volume.	2003-11-29

Next to the hyper-realism of Tomelleri, these water color illustrations did not work. Also, several were drawn from photos and were not morphologically (especially morphometrically) correct. So what? some may say.     Everything changed when I picked up a copy of Trout of the World. The style has changed just enough to make a huge difference. Sure, some of the paintings still look like he was in a hurry to meet a deadline but on the whole, I loved it. This is what we Americans (and Canadians) needed. There are other \\"cool\\" salmonids besides the stuff we are used to. Again, photos from books such as Freshwater fishes of Japan have been used as source material but I don't care. Great lateral views of some amazing fish!     James Prosek has found the right balance of color, detail and morphological information. The overall design of the book is also lovely. The lenok and taimen pictures are priceless as are the weird browns from places you would think, well...shouldn't have browns.     I think he used my Russian longfin charr as a source for his illustration. Looks very similar to the one I did some years back in pen & ink. Anyway, all fish lovers, wildlife painters and fisherman will adore this book. ANd don't just look at the pictures, read it!    Well done Mr. Prosek. I'm mad about trout, again....    Update, October 2004  The text that accompanies each illustration is fantastic. The author meets with experts of most species featured in the book. Some are academics, while others are just, well...ordinary folks who have an obsession with a certain morph, form or species of trout. The varied personalities and the strange places the author visits in quest of these wierd trout make this an unforgettable volume.	2003-11-11

All my research is focused on sturgeons, but I have always had a &quot;thing&quot; for rockfish. I for one, feel this book represents the ultimate field guide. But unlike most field guides, it has a tremendous amount of information concerning each species as well as fisheries, stock trends etc..... <BR>If you need more information on rockfish than what this volume provides, go look it up in a journal! That is what journals are for. This book does a great job in summing up the basic life history aspects and description of each species. Also worth mentioning is the fact that this is one heck of a beautiful book! The photos are good to great and the distribution maps are nicely done. In terms of overall layout, we can all learn much from this volume. BRAVO !!!!!	2003-07-28

No doubt, this is the single most important book to own if you are interested in the history of the Spitfire and all its variants. But, it should be mentioned that this is a rather ugly book in the visual sense. The color illustrations are among the worst i have ever seen (artwork varies from terrible to good). An endless number of pages are dedicated to listing serial numbers and the printing quality of the b&w photos is poor. The text is interesting and offers so much more than most Spitfire books. If you buy this volume, i strongly suggest you also get a book like Spitfire:Flying Legend. This way, you will have the definitive text in one volume and great photos of numerous variants in another.<BR>For those (like myself) who are interested in line drawings of the aircraft structure, this book is splendid. Also worth noting that almost all the photos, as so-so as some may be, are of great value because they are not seen in other books. Lots of unique things in this volume. They should take this book to a graphics design bureau and let them put it together. The result wiould be a book costing $80 instead of $...but imagine what it could look like.	2003-06-26

If you are more interested in camouflage than the actual blue print of the aircraft, this is the book for you. The level of detail concerning insignia and variation in paint schemes makes this book fascinating. Remember, the goal of the artist was not to make super realistic lateral views. Rather, it is a chronicle on the creative camouflage applications by the Luftwaffe during WW II. I was somewhat bothered by the underneath wing cross not following the shape of the wing. Unacceptable considering all the work that went into these illustrations. No one checked for typos and word spacing problems either. Still, the two volumes of this series are the most important books of their kind. Aircraft modlers will go absolutely nuts over these books.	2003-03-15

Being a Nikon lunatic, i kept seeing the book at chapters and when the price was low enough, purchased it. If you want Nikon history, it`s all there, no doubt about that. I was more interested in lens information and performance. The text reads like a nikon pamphlet and gives some information about years in production and design changes. Certain absurdities resurface on almost every page. For example, the author writes about a certain zoom that the ranges of 28-35-50-80 are indicated on the lens. So what, every nikon lens ever made has that. Why mention it on some and not others?. Clearly, the author had to fill the lines and ran out of ideas. The text reads like something very (and I mean VERY) sensured by the nikon Corporation. Even lemon lenses receive a friendly write-up. Incidently, this book is way over-priced. A great buy if you can find it for ten bucks.	2002-12-31

I am shocked that since this volume has become avaiable, only a single review has been submitted. Being a fisheries Ph.D student and long time salmonid fanatic, this is the book I've been waiting for my whole life.<BR>The design of this volume is great. Have any of you ever looked at a book's layout? This masterpiece should be studied in a graphics design course. <BR>I specialize in scientific illustration (black & white technical stuff). Much of my work has been published in Dr. Balon's: Environmental Biology of Fishes and I dare say I have an eye for what's good within this field. While Tomelleri's early salmonids (see Fishes of the South central USA) are okay at best, the ones featured in this book are out of this world. Strangely, he includes some of his earliest works(p.71, p.261). These must have been added for sentimental reasons and have little value being included with the otherwise superb lateral views. <BR>I find it strange to see the reaction of people when I show them particular pictures from this book. They seem to get equal enjoyment from all the illustrations, mainly because of the flamboyent salmonid colors. No one picks up on the astounding progression in style/technique that Tomellerri has gone through over the years. Yet it is very evident indeed. No one has pointed out that while all the renderings are lovely, stuff like the pink salmon on p.43-45 represent the technical limit of what can be achieved with color pencil realism. My favorite? The Presidio trout on p. 121. I hate to say it, but the pictures (and book overall) are too good. Anyone can pick up a leica and enjoy its smooth mechanical functions but how many of us can appreciate the beauty of German industrial design and fine craftsmanship? This book suffers a similar fate. It will sell because we all love pretty trout, end of story. <BR>I can't stop reading and looking at this book. I fall asleep next to it and in the morning, look through it some more. Our family collects antique books and my love for books extends into other fields as well. This is the greatest of all my prize posessions. <BR>I enjoyed Dr. Benke's text. He is able to convey scientific information in a style that appeals to naturalists, fishermen and those of us within the sciences. I first came across his writings in the magazine Trout and like many of you, I fell in love with his AFS book on trout of western North America. Maybe the fact that I am fascinated by phenotypic plasticity and morphological variation within species has placed me in a situation to better appreciate what this book has tried to accomplish, but I hope not. I only wish that some of you can feel what I experienced when I first received my copy of Trout & Salmon of North America. This book beautifully articulates the complex and fascinating world of salmonids through stunning pictures and wonderful text.	2002-11-14
