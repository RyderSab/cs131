Cruz does a great job documenting many Eucharistic miracles throughout the ages, from the first days after Christ's Ascension to modern times.  It was amazing to me to read about all these miracles, including well documented cases of saints who lived on nothing but the Eucharist for years!<br /><br />This book is very faith affirming.  For those of us who believe in the Real Prescence in the Eucharist, this book is like \\"hard proof\\" to strengthen our faith.  For those who come to this book not believing, they may leave the book with a strong faith in the Real Prescence.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  My only complaint is I wish the author could do an updated edition [this one is close to 30 years old now] including modern pictures of the preserved hosts and more updated information.  Otherwise, this is just a fantastic and captivating book on many miracles involving the Eucharist.	2005-10-10

I already owned Kuharski's book \\"Raising Catholic Children\\", and enjoyed it.  I bought this book expecting it to be really focused on prayer and how to include prayer in our lives as mothers of busy, full households.<br /><br />But really, this book was more of a \\"re-hash\\" of what was already in \\"Raising Catholic children\\".  It was more of a biography of the author and her 13 children [which is interesting, but I'd already read and didn't need to buy a second book to read about it again].  I didn't see much that was new or that was related specifically to prayer.<br /><br />So, while it is an entertaining book that you will probably enjoy if you haven't already read her earlier book, it doesn't really have any new content or much specifically about prayer.	2005-10-10

Dr. Sears' L.E.A.N. Kids is just what it says - a total health program for children ages 6-12.  But it is also so much more!  The authors have tackled the growing problem of unhealthy, sedentary, and overweight children in our society.  Dr. Sears expresses a strong wish to help all children be lean - that means not skinny but healthy!  He has developed a total program to aide in this endeavor and it is excellent.<br /><br />Dr. Sears outlines a very thorough plan called the \\"L.E.A.N. Kids program\\" that helps kids become lean and healthy and avoid these health pitfalls of modern life.  His plan addresses lifestyle, exercise, attitude, and nutrition.<br /><br />While this book might be exceptionally helpful for the parent of a child who is struggling with a weight problem, it will be indispensable for ALL families who want their children to grow up healthy, happy and strong.  This book is relevant to parents of children of all ages - from a mom with a newborn, who will benefit from knowing all these things BEFORE bad habits set in, to the mother of a teen who needs to be guided away from junk food and video games and toward a fun, positive, healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />This is a great program and very inspiring.  After reading this book, our family made a few changes in our diet [though we learned about nutrition from Dr. Sears many years ago and already were eating pretty well!], but we made drastic changes in our activity levels.  We have begun running together as a family at a local track three nights a week, doing yoga with the kids, and working in other types of exercise in fun ways.  Our children LOVE it!  They are so glad mommy got this book!  We were surprised at the enthusiasm we got from our kids when we started the program - they WANT to do it.  Even our two year old is enthusiastically running a quarter mile at the track and is so proud of her little self!<br /><br />I am grateful for having read this book.  I feel like our children [and we ourselves] will be much healthier as a result.  As always, reading Dr. Sears has made a very positive impact on our family!nd we ourselves] will be much healthier as a result.  As always, reading Dr. Sears has made a very positive impact on our family!	2005-09-29

My kids just aren't going to eat Apricot fish, cube steaks with blue cheese, or Moroccan fish tangine, you know?  And I honestly lack the time to make fancy meals on the weekdays - if it has more than 5 or 8 ingredients, I'm not likely to cook it, unfortunately.  Maybe when my small children are older I could cook like this, but it is not happening right now.<br /><br />The second problem I had with this book is that most of the recipes center around meat - salmon, chicken, fish, etc.  We are a single income family struggling so I can stay home with our young children.  Our grocery budget would grow out of control if I made meat the \\"Main Dish\\" at every meal.  I could not afford to feed our family this way.<br /><br />My last dissappointment was that this book really is JUST a list of recipes with shopping lists.  I thought there would be more in the way of tips for getting home cooked meals done for your family, or tips on eating healthy, etc.  But no, its just a list of recipes w/ attached grocery lists and nothing else.  You could easily come up with something just as good on your own using the internet and picking recipes your family will actually eat and can afford.  There's just not much to this book.<br /><br />So, for me, this was a waste of money.  I know the author is trying to do a good thing and has her heart in the right place, but I would not use 80% of her recipes to start with [which makes the shopping list useless], and I couldn't afford to eat like she does even if I wanted to.  There are cheaper and better ways to eat healthy!	2005-09-29

The young squire in the book succeeds where all others fail by following the words of his \\"scroll\\" and keeping himself pure - thus saving the entire kingdom from evil.<br /><br />All of my children are captivated by this story - my boy and my  girls, from the 7 year old right down to the 2 year old.  This book makes it very easy to teach children about how God's laws are made to protect them and keep them happy - and about the importance of following God's laws.  This has quickly become a favorite book at our house and we give it as a gift to every child we know - which has delighted the children and their parents alike.<br /><br />I also highly recommend \\"The Princess and the Kiss\\" by the same author - another priceless aide in raising up our children for God.	2005-08-02

Do yourself a favor and skip this book - go buy \\"Raising your Spirited Child\\" or \\"Kids, Parents, and Power struggles\\" by Kurcinka.  She covers pretty much the same type of positive parenting suggestions, but more intelligently, less judgementally, and without the continuous \\"Zen Parenting\\" \\"militant pacifist\\" ramblings.  Besides, Kurcinka is more entertaining to read and just plain likable.  :)<br /><br />Bailey doesn't have any children, and that's the core problem with this book I think.  She can work with other people's children all day long for a million years, and it won't be the same as living day to day with a precious child and coping with hard discipline situations when you've had no sleep because you've been up all night with the child, or when you have several children all clamoring for your attention all at one time, etc.<br /><br />I honestly found myself *laughing out loud* at some of her suggestions - I can't see a \\"real\\" mother using these with a \\"real\\" child.  Truly, a lot of what she said just seemed silly.<br /><br />And Baily is VERY hard on and judgemental of any parent who has EVER done anything that is contrary to her specific method.  She has no compassion for what it is REALLY like down in the trenches of parenthood - because she's never been there.  Have you ever given your child a cookie to keep him quiet in the grocery store?  AH!  You've manipulated her and turned her into a compulsive eater who will use food to soothe herself forever.  Have you ever lost it and given your child a swat on the bottom?  [even knowing you shouldn't have?!].  AH!  You've turned him into a man who will \\"stuff\\" his feelings and be frightened of emotion and will alienate his wife anytime she shows emotion.  Etc, Etc, Etc.  Baily has a thousand ways in which she can tell you how you have ruined your child for life because you are such a rotten parent.<br /><br />She also characterizes just about every parenting method in the world as \\"violent\\" or \\"negative\\" - if you quietly ask your child to please finish their chore, she says you are coercing them and trying to force your will on them... um, OK, whatever.  Maybe so, but the cat still needs to be fed.  :)<br /><br />I am a huge proponent of gentle discipline and child-friendly parenting, but this book was just ridiculous in my opinion.  There are SUCH better books out there - from real, live parents who actually KNOW what they are talking about and can give advice  with compassion and empathy rather than judgement and condemnation.<br /><br />This book was a waste of my time.you quietly ask your child to please finish their chore, she says you are coercing them and trying to force your will on them... um, OK, whatever.

This book has made a radical positive difference in my life.  It has shown me how to order my life so that I am doing all the things I'm supposed to be doing, and doing them well.  Mrs. Pierlot's perspective on the meaning of our lives as wives, mothers, and children of God was astounding - and it seems so obvious now that she's pointed it out to me, but it never occured to me on my own. She teaches us how to prioritize and truly value all that we do.  My home has been a much happier, holier, and cleaner place since I read this book!<br /><br />I think every Catholic mother could benefit from reading this book.  Every Catholic mother could benefit from instituting her own \\"rule\\" of life.  I wish I could afford to hand these out to every mom who walks in the door at Church!	2005-07-16

The book is written to help these \\"busy parents\\" [what parent isn't busy?!  LOL!] fit \\"quality time\\" in for their children - and it is broken down into 5 minute or less things to do, half hour things, weekend things etc.<br /><br />I think this book would be really helpful to parents who didn't have much time to spend with their children.  But, for a stay at home parent or a homeschooling parent, it is essentially useless in my opinion.<br /><br />Most of the things that would be appropriate for a full time parent are things that a stay at home parent is probably already doing [common sense stuff].  The rest is not geared for those who stay home with their children.  [for example, the tip to \\"write a letter to your child's teacher on the first day of school and let them know you want to be involved even though you are a working parent\\".]<br /><br />So, personally, as a stay at home mother, I was dissappointed.  I feel like I spent money on a book full of stuff that either doesn't apply to our situation or is stuff that I already DO  intuitively with my children.	2005-05-19

I had positive expectations, but was very dissappointed.  The author is EXTREMELY negative about motherhood.  When she discusses the various stages of motherhood she really goes on and on about the negatives [and of course there are plenty of those] but she rarely if ever mentions the positive things about motherhood that make it SO worth it.<br /><br />Her chapter on pregnancy and birth were just depressing - not ALL women experience pregnancy as an unwanted, horrible thing.  Not ALL happily married women's first thought upon finding out they are pregnant is that they should have an abortion!  Not ALL women feel big, fat, ugly, and completely not sexy during pregnancy.  [OK, all of us may feel that way now and then, but many women have a basically very positive experience of pregnancy and birth].  And my word, her section on childbirth was alarmist at best - hysterical is more like it.  She likens mothers who have unmedicated childbirth to \\"barbary macaque monkeys\\" and sees nothing positive, good, or beneficial coming from childbirth [with or without drugs]. Forget about the \\"rite of passage\\", the great reward at the end, and all that good stuff - according to Murphy, its a losing proposition all the way around.<br /><br />Her chapter on the post partum time period would make a pregnant mom want to slit her wrists - she makes it sound like all mothers hate and resent their babies and spend the whole post partum period neck deep in post partum depression.  While post partum depression IS a very serious issue and one that needs to be compassionately handled by all involved, this picture she paints of post partum life is just plain bleak - all the sorrows are categorized at great length and none of the joys are mentioned at all.  Very sad and totally unbalanced.<br /><br />Her section on breastfeeding was especially terrible.  Did you know that breastfeeding is awful, painful, and really, really hard?  Apparently so.  I'm pregnant with my fourth, and breastfed my first three and I really didn't realize this at all.  Wow.  Needless to say, if you plan to breastfeed, just skip her horror stories.<br /><br />I finally put the book down without finishing it.  A complete waste of money.  I couldn't stand the negativism and I really wondered why on earth this woman had children to start with?  And WHO thought it was a good idea for her to edit Parents magazine?  My children are not parasitic, life destroying organisms that I have to manage so that I can find more ME time - they are amazing, loving, vital, excellent little people.  They make my life a true joy [and sometimes a real sorrow, but that's the rollercoaster of motherhood].  They are the best thing that ever happend to me, and I feel sad that apparently not all mothers feel that way.<br /><br />So, be warned.

The author does offer some good \\"thrifty living\\" advice throughout the book as well.<br /><br />However, some of this book is more radical than most people might be willing to follow.  We are a family with several young children - we aren't really up for moving away from all family, Church, and friends to live in a remote rural location.  Nor would we be willing to convert an old bus into a home for our family.  We aren't willing to give up basic utilities either.  And as far as squatting on someone else's land and hiding our camp... well, let's just say that's not very practical with toddlers.  :)<br /><br />So, I think this book may be somewhat useful to families who are trying to live a thrifty existence and avoid the consumer trap.  But at the same time, much of the advice may be too extreme for most people.<br /><br />Its worth reading though, and I found the author's wry, conversational style writing entertaining and easy to read.	2005-01-16

It is beautifully done - the illustrations are wonderful, the writing is excellent, and the story is done in such a way as to really touch you - heart and soul.  We use this book to teach both our daughters and son about purity and its importance.  This book presents this issue in a way that small children can understand and it builds a foundation that will be very easy for us to expand upon as they mature.<br /><br />What a gift this book is in a culture where we are surrounded and overwhelmed by the most impure of things!  We are teaching our children to disdain the cultural messages that surround them [and at this tender age, we protect them from those messages and images to the extent we possibly can].  We are teaching our children to follow God - the only thing that really matters.<br /><br />The Princess and the Kiss is a precious book - a story of the real value of purity [for both girls AND boys], told in such a way that it still brings tears to my eyes every time I read it - even after dozens and dozens of readings!<br /><br />This book has become our standard gift for Christmas and Birthdays for all the precious little girls and boys we know and love - and every single one that has recieved this book has *adored* it and their parents were very grateful.

Because of that I've purchased most of the books out right now on raising boys.<br />I found this book by Dobson to be interesting.  His chapters on the biological differences in boys and girls were very enlightening.  I also thought his chapter on the importance of fathers to families was excellent - and over due in the popular media.  [yep, Dads really ARE important to their children it turns out!]  In addition, I share Dobson's passion for having the mother in the home raising her children, especially when her children are very young.  It is THE most important job in the world, and its about time *somebody* recognized that.<br />His chapter on the mother's role in raising her son wasn't quite so good, seemed a bit shallow and under-developed.  The entire chapter devoted to &quot;preventing homosexuality&quot; seemed misplaced and a bit obsessive to me.  The book is sprinkled with references to homosexuality throughout and, frankly, I felt Dr. Dobson was a little over the top on the subject.  He's theories on the origins of homosexuality are a little unusual as well.<br />The book seemed very &quot;black and white&quot; throughout, and was heavy with statements that &quot;all boys do XX&quot; or whatever.  My son may not be the 'typical' boy [though he does run around hitting everything with his 'sword' and 'fighting bad guys'....], but he didn't really fit Dobson's rigid mold.  I think that while boys and girls *are* different, there is still a wide range of normal variation within the definition of 'healthy manhood'.<br />Over all, I felt this book was worth reading and found many of his points interesting.  Some of them were even helpful.  But this book is not the 'end all' of boy-rearing books, and probably not the best one on the market either.	2004-02-13

Day Care Deception is an excellent, well-researched, and hard hitting book that reveals the truth of the dangers of non-parental care and the importance of Parent-child togetherness.  It challenges our current cultural placations that day care is &quot;OK&quot; and that a parent's choice to put a child in the care of others does not damage that child.<br />The author discusses a surprising number of very well funded [some government backed] and well researched studies that reveal a huge range of ill-effects to children placed in day care.  He outlines how the research itself is manipulated and distorted to show 'positive' or 'neutral' outcomes, when the actual data shows very clearly that the outcomes are overwhelmingly negative.  The author also reveals a wide spread media conspiracy to keep these findings from the public to avoid causing anyone to feel 'guilty'.<br />Any parent considering how their child will be cared for on a day to day basis would do well to read this book.  In order to make good decisions, families need to know the *truth*.  Every parent wants the best for their child, and they need to have all the facts so that they can provide this to the best of their ability.  Robertson has written a very compelling and important book that all parents should be privy to.	2004-01-25

I bought this book because I LOVED \\"Simplify your life\\" by this author.  I found it very helpful.  This book, however, was mostly confounding and fairly depressing.  While St. James *did* seek out advice from her friends who had children, these friends apparently take a very 'hands off' approach to their kids.<br />The book opens with a scenario in which a mother has forgotten to pick up her child and the child is stranded somewhere late in the evening while she tries to figure out a way to get someone else to go pick him up now that she's home and needs to make dinner.  This did not bode well for the rest of the book [for those of us who don't routinely completely forget about our children and leave them alone in public places late at night....]<br />Much of the advice in this book falls into the category of \\"simplify your life with children by paying someone else to deal with the little brats\\".  There is much about how parents should put their children in day care all day [and don't EVER let your child think they have the ability to cause you to delay your departure because of their pathetic tears, etc, etc, etc] and then get a sitter to care for the children in the evenings so mom can have \\"Me\\" time and parents can have \\"Us\\" time.  Apparently, if you schedule 2 hours of \\"quality time\\" on Sunday afternoon with your kids, that's really all they need.<br />There was also a big push to teach the kids \\"self sufficiency\\" - as in, your 5 year old really can get his own breakfast so he  doesn't \\"bother\\" you.  I'm all for self sufficient kids and encouraging my children to be strong and independant, but too much of this book was geared towards forcing your kids to basically survive without any parental assistance or interaction - yeah... I guess that would be simplier than actually caring for your kids yourself.  At least until they turn 13 and get put in jail for shooting up the school or something.<br />There were a few good ideas in this book, but not nearly enough to warrant wading through all the bad parenting advice and depressing disregard for children's well being.  \\"Shelter for the Spirit\\" by Victoria Moran includes some great chapters on re-prioritizing and simplifying that are very child-friendly and would lead to strong parent-child relationships.  In my opinion, parents would do better to read what Moran has to say and skip this particular book by St. James.jail for shooting up the school or something.  <br />There were a few good ideas in this book, but not nearly enough to warrant wading through all the bad parenting advice and depressing disregard for children's well being.  \\"Shelter for the Spirit\\" by Victoria Moran includes some great chapters on re-prioritizing and simplifying that are very child-friendly and would lead to strong parent-child relationships.

Use Caution With Little Kids	This is a re-telling of a Russian fairy tale illustrated by KY Craft [far and away the best illustrator I've ever encountered].  This is a Cinderella type tale turned graphically gruesome.<br />We bought this book for our daughter's 5th birthday. She has several other KY Craft books and adores them all.  However when I recieved this one from amazon and opened it up my husband and I both worried that it was not appropriate for our children.  [They have enough nightmares as it is!]<br />While the illustrations are beautifully detailed and absolutely amazing [as always with KY Craft], the story is about a horrible witch, Baba Yaga, who eats people and lives in a house made of bones [graphically illustrated in great detail].  She has a hideous frightening appearance [also rendered in great detail] and the entire book is extremely dark and frightening.  This is definitely the stuff of nightmares and horror movies.<br />So, it was with much trepidation that I read the book to my 5 year old and 2 year old... I expected them to be very frightened.  To the contrary, they found Baba Yaga *fascinating* and LOVED the story... they want me to read it again and again.<br />As an adult I appreciated the level of detail and the amazing art work, but I was amazed that my young children could read this book and not be terrified.  They truly adore it though... who would have guessed?!!	2003-12-14

I started this book fully prepared to dislike it - I've read many others on this topic and ALL of them have recommended extensive child care for the kids, have supported long hours away from the children, and have been generally negative about how children 'get in the way' of your business.  I see working at home under those kinds of guidelines as no better than working outside the home - and maybe worse.  However, this book was very, VERY forthright in its intention - promoting work at home  so that one can spend more time doing what is most important - with spending time with family at the top of the list.  The author makes it clear that a work at home parent needs to set limits on how much time they work and that they need to remember that their families are their first priority and their whole reason for going this route.  She offers excellent tips on how to be a good, present and interactive parent while managing a very successful WAH business.  I was truly impressed.<br /><br />This aspect aside, this book is an amazing collection of facts and data and experience - it is VERY complete and thorough on the topic of putting together and running a home business.  She includes a massive number of resources. I feel this is the only book a mother who wanted to WAH would need to get started and do well.	2003-12-10

Gavin De Becker has compiled a very thorough, interesting, readable, and *essential* guide to keeping children safe in our world.  While there are parts of this book that may be unpleasant to read [nobody likes to read about bad things happening to children], it will instruct and prepare parents to keep their children out of harm's reach.  I found the book very empowering and have already implemented many of his suggestions.  This book also reduces fear in the sense that it helps parents seperate common yet improbable fears [child abduction by strangers]  from the very real fears that they may be turning a blind eye to [like molestation by a family member].  It helps parents understand what they need to do to prevent this kind of tragedy and yet also helps them seperate 'media hype' from reality.  I am extremely glad to have found this book and read it and I feel that my children are far safer because of it.  If every parent would read this book  our world would be a much safer place for children!	2003-12-10

This is one of the best books I've ever read [and I'm a book nut, so that's really saying something! :) ].  I picked this book up one evening and literally ended up staying up all night long to finish it - I couldn't go to bed until I got to the ending.  [I have several small children who get up at 5am, so this is not something that is normal for me to do].<br />This book is one of the best mysteries I've ever read - it is full of colorful, rich, engaging characters and the plot is just amazing.  You will care passionately about these people from the very first chapters of the book.  It is a &quot;coming of age&quot; story in some ways, but different from anything else I've ever read.<br />It is also a very important book because of the story it tells.  Our history is not always good and glorious and it is good to remember the dead and understand our past - it helps us all build a better future.  This book succeeds brilliantly in helping us do that without being preachy or heavy.<br />You will NOT regret buying this book!  I can say without hesitation that I *love* it.	2003-12-02

But this book was a big disappointment.  I have 2 children [a toddler and a preschooler] who are very poor sleepers.  I bought this book hoping for some help in getting them to sleep better.  It was useless to me, unfortunately.<br />This book contains a great explanation of how babies and children [and even grown ups] sleep.  It is very supportive of the 'family bed' or 'co-sleeping' and very 'attachment parenting' oriented.  This would be a wonderful book for an expecting or brand new mother who doesn't know what to expect concerning how her baby will sleep.<br />But if you already have a child who has a sleep problem, you will find very little of practical use here.  Dr. Fleiss promises to tell you how to get your child to sleep in a healthy way, but what he offers are very simplistic, common sense ideas that any half way intelligent parent would probably be using anyway.  [ie:  don't give your kid caffeine; dont feed your kid a whole bunch of junk food; don't let your kid watch TV right before bed; have your child sleep in a hygenic, insect free room; make sure your kid gets exercise; dress your child in comfortable clothes - or no clothes - for bedtime; don't give your kid drugs or alchohol to make them sleep!! etc].<br />For those of us already doing all these common sense things, there is nothing else suggested.  Dr. Fleiss assumes that any parent who does these things will have a child who sleeps blissfully all night [or as much as is age appropriate].  This simply isn't true in many cases.<br />He also includes some more strange things - for example, he tries to build a case that circumcision causing nightwaking.  First of all, there is no research that actually supports this.  Second of all, my daughter and my intact son are both horrible sleepers.  [And I know lots of circumcised boys who sleep great].  Third, if you are reading this book, you have probably *already* made the decision on whether to circ or not - and if you have, there's not anything you can do to undo it.  So this really isn't helpful at all.  He also maintains that non-flammable polyester causes cancer and so does television.  [I haven't seen any research to back these claims...while he may  be right, I'm uncomfortable that this is stated as 'fact' and not 'theory'.]<br />He also seems to go 'off the deep end' a bit in some of his other suggestions.  One thing I found particularly odd was the section on co-sleeping where he suggests just explaining sex to your children [because they can handle it at any age, no matter how young] and the kids will probably just leave the room when they see mom and dad start getting 'affectionate'.  Hello?  Not in my house anyway.... I think I'll allow my babies and preschoolers to hold on to their innocence a bit longer, thanks.<br />Overall, I did not find this book useful.  You might have better luck with _The No Cry Sleep Solution_ by Elizabeth Pantley if you have a frequent night waker of your own.  She offers concrete ideas and solutions that are completely lacking here.you are reading this book, you have probably *already* made the decision on whether to circ or not - and if you have, there's not anything you can do to undo it.

I bought this book because I have two children who wake very frequently at night and I am EXHAUSTED.  I am open to just about any suggestions to help them sleep.<br />But boy, I could never follow this woman's advice - I couldn't treat a dog like this, and certainly not my children.<br />This woman is recommending the same tired old 'cry it out' method [you don't need a book to explain this method - its pretty self explanitory].  But she seems awfully extreme to me, even for a Cry It Out proponent.<br />She actually writes that you should *expect* your child to cry until s/he vomits and then you should just clean it up 'as best you can' preferably without picking up the child!  [She also recommends making the crib with double sheets so you can just quickly rip off the top layer when your baby vomits as expected.]  The she says that babies and toddlers actually think vomiting is FUN and that they use vomiting as a tool to manipulate their parents.  This is the most bizarre and evil thing I think I've ever read!  My children certainly don't enjoy vomiting, and for them to be so upset that they vomit would mean that they were absolutely hysterical with fear and misery.  I would never intentionally inflict this on my child.<br />Other recommendations she makes seem just cruel to me as well - to turn on loud music, shower, or do other similar things so that you are not 'bothered' by your child screaming in misery and fear in their room; that 'head banging' all night long is normal and common behavior [maybe for babies who are traumatized like this it is - I don't see it in the babies and toddlers I know who have never been subjected to this kind of treatment], that crying for an hour or more is just fine, and not to check on the child too frequently lest s/he cry more to manipulate you, etc.<br />I was just appalled.  I couldn't ignore complete stranger who was in so much distress, let alone my own children.

Boy was I dissappointed!  This book is really more of a far left environmentalist manifesto than a practical help book.  It is just full of references to our evil, materialistic, and exploitative culture and our wanton destruction of Mother Earth.  I *am* an environmentally concerned person and consider myself pretty 'ecologically sound' in general, but this book was pretty extreme even for me.<br />Much of the content on 'how much are you really worth' and 'where does your money really go?' truly is common sense - we have been using this idea for years - our time IS worth much more than our money.  We did use some of the prinicples recommended in order to make it possible for me to stay home full time with our children. [We did that on our own, long before reading this book - it really was 'common sense'].  The book itself just wasn't that helpful to me.<br />This book would be useful to you if you are a hard core environmentalist type who would like to drop out of society and live off the land somewhere.  For the rest of mainstream society, this book has really very little to offer.	2003-03-29

I bought this book five years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.  I did not want to breastfeed.  I didn't know a single soul who had breastfed.  I thought breastfeeding was pretty weird and gross and had already told my husband I was going to bottlefeed.  After I read a lot of information on the benefits of breastfeeding in several different magazines and pregnancy/childbirth books, I decided I better look into it a little more.  I bought this book simply because I liked the title, and I have been SO extremely grateful ever since.<br />This book is very non-threatening and completely NOT militant!  I'm surprised by the reviews I see here saying otherwise - the author was so laid back and respectful, that it actually allowed me to open my mind to the possibility of breastfeeding.  If she had been some kind of militant breastfeeding person, I never would have read more than the first few pages - however, I found a funny, sincere author who tried to fairly present breastfeeding [both the advantages and the (often humorous) disadvantages].  I thought she was brilliant.<br />This book is a very \\"basic\\" breastfeeding book. It doesn't have all the level of detail of some other books [like \\"The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\" by La Leche League - a book that has EVERYTHING you'd ever need to know, but is definitely [obviously!] biased towards breastfeeding].  I think this book is a great basic guide for new mothers and a WONDERFUL place to start if you are just considering breastfeeding or trying to make that decision.<br />Incidentally, I did end up nursing my first child successfully, mainly due to this book.  My original goal was to breastfeed for 3 months, but it went so well that I ended up nursing her for a whole year!  I also used this book when I got pregnant with my second child and nursed him for a year too. Now I am re-reading it while pregnant with my third baby and I am STILL enjoying it!  This is money well spent in my opinion!	2003-03-23

It is very thorough and gives the birthing couple all the information they need to make informed choices about their birth.  I would say this is one of the best books available for preparation for Labor and Delivery and understanding all the decisions and issues Birth entails.<br />I do have a few complaints about the book, however.<br />1.  The book glosses over the pain most women experience during childbirth.  For most women [not all, but most], labor and delivery IS very painful.  A mother who is preparing for an unmedicated birth needs to be aware of this so that she can adequately prepare herself.  The Searses make birth sound more like &quot;pressure&quot; and &quot;discomfort&quot;.  I just don't think this is true for the majority of women.  For psychological preparation for the true *reality* of birth, I recommend _Birthing From Within_ by Pam England.  She does a much more honest job in preparing women for what the birth might really be like.  [She does not include much of the information the Seares have included here on the 'medical' side of birth &amp; the issues involved however; combining these two books would give the reader a very complete education].<br />2.  I must agree with previous reviewers that this book is somewhat biased against any medication during birth, as well as against hospital birth with an OBGYN in attendance.  However, that doesn't make the information in the book any less useful - it is wonderful and very complete.<br />3.  I also agree with other reviewers that the book is becoming a bit dated now.  It is time for a revision that would include and reflect the progress that many hospitals have made in the last decade.<br />Those issues aside, I still think this is one of the best books available on birth.  Its worth having for any pregnant woman.	2003-03-02

The authors provide a very Bible-based and scripturally backed method of childrearing.  We found this book absolutely indispensible as Christian parents.<br />The authors encourage parents to work with the nature of the baby/child God gave them [which only makes sense - God created babies the way they are for very good reasons!].  I felt very comfortable using their parenting and child care recommendations and I truly found their ideas in harmony with my faith.  We feel that using the suggestions in this book has helped us to become the parents that God wants us to be [well, on our good days at least! :) ].  We are also very pleased with the way our children are turning out.<br />This book provides a very interesting counterpoint to another \\"Christian\\" system of child rearing that was recommended to us - Gary Ezzo's \\"Growing Kids God's Way\\" [and the secular version \\"Baby Wise\\"].  For us, the Sears book was clearly more in line with our Christian faith and our beliefs about our divine calling as parents to God's own precious children.  I would recommend any Christian family read this book as a balance to the Ezzo books - regardless of which method you choose, you will benefit from understanding both sides of the issue!	2003-03-02

The author is a veteran of two complicated pregnancies involving extended bed rest and she has put together an amazing amount of information and resources in this book.  I wish I'd had this book for my first two pregnancies and am SO GLAD to have it for my third!<br />The author includes a huge amount of information and practical suggestions for coping with bed rest.  She gives great suggestions on how to get the help a bed rest mom will need and where to find the resources that might be available to help these mothers and their families.  She also discusses in great detail both hospital bed rest and bed rest in the home.<br />There is also a fantastic section on coping with bed rest when one already has other children [and how to help the children cope!], as well as a great section on fathers.<br />I would recommend this book to any mother facing bed rest in her pregnancy - whether this is her first pregnancy or her fifth!  This book is just overflowing with great information and is very encouraging and helpful.  It is also a very easy and enjoyable book to read.  It is very well written and worth every cent!	2003-03-01

This book isn't really about &quot;A Mom Like Me&quot;, nor is it really about homeschooling.<br />The author is an apparently wealthy mother of 10 homeschooled children.  [I say apparently wealthy because her husband is a well known lawyer and she employs a weekly housecleaner, yard person, and mother's helpers - not something most of our budgets will cover].<br />The book also has really very little to do with homeschooling - extremely little practical advice and only a couple of the chapters are even about homeschooling.  There IS a chapter on the religious beliefs that led this family to homeschool, and a very general, superficial [and not so useful] chapter on &quot;homeschooling a housefull&quot;.<br />Instead, this book is a very personal story of the author's life, her faith journey, and her religious beliefs.  She is strongly in favor of homeschooling, which one would expect, but she is also very strongly in favor of some other ideas - such as foregoing all family planning [including natural family planning] and &quot;letting the Lord determine her family size&quot; as well as the idea of the wife submitting to the husband.<br />The book includes a very detailed and personal story of her reproductive history, as well as how she and her husband came to their beliefs.  She includes very appropriate scriptural references for everything she suggests and puts forth very intelligent arguments.<br />While this book was not at all what I expected, I did find it interesting, easy to read, and compelling.  I may not agree with all of the author's viewpoints, but I can certainly see how she arrived at them and I can follow her spiritual logic.  I enjoyed the book thoroughly.<br />There was a slight shadow of arrogance running throughout the book that was a little annoying.  It was sort of a sense of &quot;this is how *I* do things and my way is the right way&quot;.  Sometimes it felt a little like the author was saying &quot;see how wonderful I am!&quot;  I didn't agree with all of her suggestions or the way her family handled everything, but I still found the book very interesting and thought provoking.;  I didn't agree with all of her suggestions or the way her family handled everything, but I still found the book very interesting and thought provoking.	2003-02-25

I've truly enjoyed some other books I've read on this subject and have found them very useful.  I had high hopes for this book as well, but found some really serious problems with it.<br />First of all, I was expecting a book on actual Natural methods of enhancing fertility [kind of like \\"Fertility, Cycles, and Nutrition\\" I suppose].  The first third of this book is about nothing but conventional medical treatment.  That's kind of annoying, but my real problem is that I don't think its even covered well - for example, she's listing \\"pros and cons\\" of all these different medical treatments and leaving out pretty important things [like mood swings and depression being a side effect of Clomid - pretty well accepted I think].<br />I also had a real conflict with this book as a Catholic.  [This may be irrelevant to many readers, but I'll include my concerns here anyway in case they are helpful to some].  She makes an erroneous and inflammatory comment about the Catholic Church in a section on \\"Emotional issues with Infertility\\" where she says that \\"some Churches are extremely hard on Infertile couples.  But there has been a breakthrough with the Catholic Church in that they have recently accepted a proceedure to open blocked fallopian tubes.\\".  [The Catholic Church is the only Church mentioned by name, definitely seeming to single it out].  The author comes accross as pretty negative towards the Catholic Church and insinuates that the Catholic church doesn't support infertility treatment.  This is actually untrue - the Church is *extremely* supportive of treatment for infertility [including surgery to open tubes, certain drug therapys such as Clomid, etc].  What the Church absolutely DOES not support or condone is proceedures where embryos are created and then destroyed - for *Catholics* that is Murder and it is unconscionable.  The Church also doesn't condon artificial insemination or cloning [which violate the God given nature of conception according to our religious beliefs].  She doesn't cover this at all and leaves the reader with the impression that the mean old Catholic Church just doesn't want poor infertile couples to get any help at all.<br />I had a real problem with the book morally - under her section on InVitro Fertilization she doesn't even mention the fact that routinely about 20 embryos are created and all but 2 or 3 are either destroyed or frozen.  She doesn't mention this as a concern or an issue in her \\"pros and cons\\" section.  I think that if she is truly writing an objective book trying to educate people she should at least be *honest* about the pros and cons - for many people, creating embryos you *know* you'll destroy IS a problem.  She also doesn't mention the high incidence of \\"selective abortion\\" where a woman may be implanted with multiple embryos and three or more \\"take\\" - then the doctor is likely to recommend selectively aborting some of the babies.  This is also fairly routine and is a moral problem for some people.<br />These issues are not a problem for many people, so this won't be relevant to them; but the moral issues are worth mentioning as fair warning to those with religious belief systems that don't support some of the things she's recommending.  Regardless of one's beliefs, her failure to mention these things at all is NOT a balanced or honest presentation of the procedures she's purporting to describe objectively.<br />Aside from the moral issues, I just don't think this book is very good - its not that well written [she wanders around in paragraphs and switches topics mid-stream and the book isn't edited very well].  It also doesn't really hold true with the title - it isn't really about \\"Natural\\" Fertilty Enhancement, it is trying to be more of an \\"all encompasing\\" Infertility handbook as far as I can tell, including much info on popular medical treatments.  In trying to cover*everything* she covers none of it well - including the sections on natural methods. I just don't find this book outstanding in any way unfortunately.In trying to cover *everything* she covers none of it well - including the sections on natural methods.

What I got was a book that wasn't so much about cooking as a manifesto of Evangelical Christian Stay at Home Motherhood.  Now, as a Christian Stay at Home Mother, this book kind of worked for me and I did actually enjoy reading it; however, if I were of a different background I would have found this book HUGELY frustrating!  It truly should be marketed as a book on Christian Motherhood - not as a secular book on Freezer Cooking.  [Although I think the subtitle &quot;More Mary and Less Martha&quot; is a clue, it isn't clear enough that this book is for a very narrow audience].<br />The book isn't really even about Freezer Cooking, although it does have some helpful chapters on that subject [though I was 1/3 the way through the book before I got to them].  It is more about Managing the home as a stay at home mother, instilling Christian values and faith in one's children, and being a frugal &quot;good steward&quot; of God's gifts.  The book is full of interesting stories about the author's family and experiences.  I found it very entertaining and helpful, though in completely different ways than I expected.<br />It is worth noting that this book appears possibly self published - the editing is very poor and there are many typos, mispellings, and my copy even had a whole section repeated in the book [pages XX-YY appeared twice as exact duplicates].<br />This book is more like reading a mother's journal or diary of her family life and religious life than it is like reading a book on cooking.  Which may be exactly what you want to read, but be forewarned if that's not what you are looking for!  I see that this author has released a new book _Mega Cooking_ - I'm curious to buy that one and see whether it is more of a &quot;real&quot; Cook book or not.	2003-01-02
US	52547679	R2LY0HMUKJVWGN	0440503744	895200780	Speed Cleaning	Books	3	136	147	N	N	Lots of Hype, But Less Real Substance	I was very excited about this book and the idea of learning to clean my house more quickly and efficiently.  When I read the author's intro and the comments included in the book [as well as the positive reviews here] I just knew I'd hit on a great cleaning solution.  Unfortunately, in reading the book, I found it really didn't live up to the author's build up.<br />For starters, the method really ISN'T very efficient.  The author strongly recommends a whole arsenal of cleaning solutions and cleaning devices/tools.  I just don't think the average home owner really needs all that stuff to do a quick and good job cleaning.  [I'd be lost just trying to keep up with all those things!]  I will note however, that all of these cleaning items are offered for sale on their website and catalog - a fact that is mentioned NUMEROUS times throughout the book [\\"buy our stuff!\\"].  The first time or two I read about their catalog in the book, I thought \\"how cool - one place to pick up all this stuff!\\".  By the 10th mention of it I was feeling a little like I'd paid for a book that was really just advertising for their company and products. [\\"No, really, BUY OUR STUFF!\\"]  I also thought the prices on the website were pretty ridiculous [way higher than I would pay to get the same stuff at Home Depot or someplace like that].  You would *easily* spend well over $$$ to buy all the products they tell you that you MUST have from their website/catalog.<br />Another example of why I don't feel this method is very quick or efficient - many long years ago I read a Don Aslet book [who I recommend!].  In that book he said something that has stuck with me for almost a decade - \\"don't scrub anything you can soak\\" [or something to that effect].  Practically speaking, this means that when I begin to clean, I soak things first.  If there are spills of food on the stove that have turned to rock, I pour a bit of water on it and let it sit for 5 or 10 minutes while I clean something else.  The same with dishes, etc.  I *NEVER* have to scrub - when I come back, I am able to wipe up the mess in one or two swipes with a paper towel.  VERY QUICK and energy and time efficient.  In contrast, Mr. Campbell spends pages and pages on how to scrub and scrape up a similar hardened spill/mess.  He recommends beginning with one scrubbing utensil and working up to another and then yet another and then moving to a putty knife type instrument and then an actual RAZOR blade [which would damage my kitchen surfaces to no end...].  Never once does he even mention the idea of just soaking the stuff so it wipes up easily.  I don't think that's very efficient personally.<br />Other things that bugged me about the book were that it seems really written more for commercial cleaning teams.  It claims to be written for the average homeowner, but most of the methods are truly suited to a professional \\"team\\" approach.  He spends a great deal of time describing how the team should split up the work, etc.  [I don't know about you, but I certainly don't have a set of friends that show up at my house every weekend to help me clean it...].  He runs a cleaning service in San Francisco, which he mentions repeatedly - I feel this book was really written for professional cleaners like him.  I also didn't like the constant high pressure sales pitch; and I agree with another reviewer that the \\"spanish summary\\" at the end seemed kind of useless - why not publish the whole thing in spanish?  Much more useful.<br />There WERE good things about this book - while I found most of the better suggestions to be \\"common sense\\", they might be really helpful to someone who has never done a lot of cleaning [maybe a young person out on their own for the first time] or for someone who doesn't feel that they are very \\"efficient\\" in general.  I also LOVED the chapter on the environmental impact of the cleaning products and found it very useful.  [Worth the price of the book in fact].  There is also a good chapter on hiring a cleaning service/housekeeper - although that chapter seemed very misplaced in this particular book [If I could afford a house cleaner, I *wouldn't* be buying this book to learn to do it myself!].  The book was also very easy and quick to read.<br />Overall I'd say it was worth the money, but not NEARLY as wonderful as it is hyped up to be!chapter on hiring a cleaning service/housekeeper - although that chapter seemed very misplaced in this particular book [If I could afford a house cleaner, I *wouldn't* be buying this book to learn to do it myself!].

I've read quite a lot of Dr. & Martha Sears' books and agree with some previous reviewers who have said that some of their  most recent releases are just rehashes of old stuff [something I began to find very frustrating!].  However, this book was well worth my money!<br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a well organized book taking a \\"bird's eye view\\" of childrearing - not getting so bogged down in babyhood, but looking at the long term goals and results.  I found the research quoted throughout fascinating and really enjoyed their synthesis of scientific study.  I liked seeing their logic on how their suggestions for raising babies, preschoolers, and elementary age kids on up are likely to result in the attributes I want for my own children.<br />I particularly enjoyed the chapters on Siblings [something they are obviously experts at after 8 children!], Raising Moral and Responsible Children, and Sexuality; as well as the numerous suggestions and ideas for raising older children.  This book is an excellent follow up to \\"The Baby Book\\" - what to do when the baby isn't a baby any  more!<br />Even if you are not the least bit inclined towards Attachment Parenting, this book would be an interesting read just as a counterpoint to your own philosophy.  I'm very excited to have found such a useful book!	2002-12-17

Ideas to simplify Christmas are *exactly* what I needed! And I did get a few good ideas from this book - maybe a handful. I agree with a previous reviewer who said the book has a lot of \\"Filler\\". It does.<br />But I almost felt depressed reading this book - obviously Ms. St. James really dislikes Christmas. The book was extremely negative about every aspect of Christmas, with the exception of encouraging outreach and giving to those less fortunate [something I actively support as well]. But she hates Christmas trees, Christmas cards, Christmas dinner, giving or receiving Christmas gifts [even suggesting that we are \\"burdening\\" our loved ones by giving them gifts]. She hates pretty much everything about Christmas and apparently doesn't celebrate it.<br />There is also a strong Pagan/Earth Religion undertone to the book. Christmas is a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Christ [or at least it WAS until it was hijacked by marketing executives...]. The author never once mentions the ostensible purpose of Christmas - Christ's birth. She does however have a chapter on celebrating Christmas for \\"Mother Earth\\", repeated mention of Christmas as \\"Winter Solstice\\" [a Wiccan/Earth Religion Holy Day], as well as another section on how to bury arrows representing prayers to the \\"Great Spirit\\". [I'm pro-environment myself, so I'm not discouraging the \\"be nice to mother earth\\" idea, but it was very awkwardly done in a book on this topic].<br />She is very \\"new agey\\" and apparently very non-Christian. While I have no problem with her personal religious choices, its kind of weird reading a book on celebrating Christmas by a non-Christian. Kind of like reading a book on Celebrating Hannukah written by an Atheist or something. I think some of the suggestions she makes might actually be offensive to more fundamentalist Christian readers as well.<br />Overall, I don't think this book was worth the money. I wish I'd taken in out at the library. It was still worth reading for the handful of good ideas I came accross, but overall it was pretty lame, slightly depressing, and gave me a weird vibe.  I think _Shelter For The Spirit_ by Victoria Moran has MUCH better chapters on celebrating holidays, and she is very respectful of all kinds of different religious beliefs [including Christian].  I highly recommend her book.his book was worth the money. I wish I'd taken in out at the library.

It is a very basic book, and for people who've already made significant changes towards more simple living, it won't be very useful.  But if you are overworked, stressed out, buried in clutter and feel you don't have a moment for yourself, pick up this book!  It would be a good place to begin.<br />Most of what the author recommends, our family already does.  Some of it IS common sense, but most of it is &quot;counter cultural&quot; and many of us wouldn't think of doing these things on our own.  I think she has some really good ideas.  She is also a good example of someone who has lived an extremely successful, hectic life and moved toward a more simple existence - without depriving herself of anything she truly values.<br />I agree with another reviewer that she's a little &quot;misanthropic&quot; - she does seem to consider people &quot;clutter&quot; and to be quick to recommend ditching the humans in your life.  While this can sometimes be good advice with certain individuals, I truly value my family, friends, and &quot;houseguests&quot; [which she implies are always &quot;unwanted&quot;].  I would not care for a life without these dear ones - simple or no.  Sometimes people are messy, and sometimes we do need to move on from damaging relationships; but in general human companionship is worth the &quot;complications&quot; in my opinion.<br />This is a good general &quot;beginners guide to the simple life&quot; and is also a very quick and easy read - good for mommies like me [and others] who have to do their reading in 5 minute snatches here and there!	2002-11-29
US	52547679	R11JLFBQQ2NJAS	0965498506	262706025	When Pregnancy Isn't Perfect : A Layperson's Guide To Complications In Pregnancy	Books	1	46	51	N	Y	Extremely Outdated, Poorly Researched, Highly Negative	After two complicated pregnancies involving months of bedrest, I was very excited to find this book to read as I go through my third pregnancy.  I was very, very dissappointed.  I am a Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator with extensive knowledge about pregnancy in general and very specific knowledge about my own two complications:  Pregnancy Induced Hypertension and Preterm Labor.  In addition to my own interests, I read this whole book hoping to learn more about other complications so that I could help my students who are experiencing these.<br />There are several things that make this book almost useless:<br />1.  The Research is EXTREMELY outdated.  The book, originally published in 1991 claims to have been revised in 1996.  However, checking her sources listed in the Bibliography, NONE of them are more recent than the 1980s.  In reading the whole book, I realized she obviously didn't update any of her research and the explanations and medical information she gives are so outdated that they are useless at best and possibly harmful at worst [some of the information she gives on Pregnancy Induced Hypertension is not only wrong, it would be dangerous for a pregnant woman to follow her advice].  10-15 years in the medical field is an *eternity* - things change so fast, new breakthroughs and research happen all the time and a book like this needs to either be kept accurately up to date or removed from publication.<br />2.  Even her original research was bad.  She is NOT an medical or scientific person, which could be really good for a book like this [we are looking for a lay person's explanation after all!].  However, she obviously had no real medical or scientifically knowledgeable person proof her book.  It is full of errors that make it hard to believe anything she writes.  For example, in the chapter on \\"when pregnancy IS perfect\\" she is discussing normal pregnancy and labor and delivery. She writes:  \\"When the baby's head can be seen through the opening of the vagina, it is called crowning - because it is almost always the crown of the baby's head that emerges first.\\"  This is not accurate.  Crowning occurs when the largest circumference of the baby's head is emerging through the perineum - when the vagina is stretched the most it will have to stretch.  This has nothing to do with when the baby's head can first be seen - which can actually be hours before crowning occurs in some cases, depending on how long the pushing phase lasts.  This is not a huge deal, but the book is FULL of little inaccuracies like this - my copy is just covered in highlights where I underlined what she wrote that was wrong.  It was very hard for me to take the rest of the book seriously when she made so many very basic errors.  Even the word \\"Foreword\\" is misspelled on the cover of the book - it is spelled \\"Forward\\".  Poor editing and not enough scientific understanding plague this whole book in my opinion.<br />3.  The book is extremely negative.  The author lost her twin baby daughter soon after birth after a highly complicated pregnancy.  She wrote this book as a way of coping with her grief and it shows.  The book is very quick to bring up pregnancy loss and neonatal/infant death, often in places where it is innappropriate.  I'm afraid that a pregnant woman reading this book would get a very skewed idea of her baby's chances of survival - the reality is that the VAST MAJORITY of complicated pregnancies end with a healthy child and a healthy mother.  I think that reading this book would only add undue stress and worry for a pregnant mother in a complicated pregnancy situation, and I myself found the book very upsetting and difficult to read at times.  [Even after having two successful healthy births after prior complicated pregnancies]. The reality is that babies do sometimes die.  But we don't need to dwell so much on that possibility - we need to acknowledge it, do everything we can to prevent it, and then move on.  Brooding over it doesn't help anyone.<br />What is good about this book?  There is an excellent chapter on \\"Pregnancy Loss:  When the Worst Happens\\".  It would be very useful to a couple who had lost a child.  However, I would NEVER recommend that a pregnant mother read this chapter unless there were very clear and obvious reasons to believe that her pregnancy was absolutely going to end in death of the baby.  For most mothers it would be an exercise in torture - upsetting to the extreme and not likely to be helpful in the majority of cases.<br />Other than that, I didn't find any positives to this book.  I strongly recommend against it and would suggest that a mother experiencing a complicated pregnancy get her information from her doctor and her own research from *reliable* and *up to date* sources.  As far as bedrest goes, there is a MUCH better book on this topic.  \\"The Pregnancy Bed Rest Book: A Survival Guide for Expectant Mothers and Their Families\\" by Amy E. Tracy is EXCELLENT.  Buy that one instead.  Personally I'm very sorry I spent the money on this book.it doesn't help anyone.  <br />What is good about this book?

This book is a great introduction to the family bed.  It includes guidelines for safe co-sleeping, scientific and medical reasons why cosleeping is so good for baby, enjoying a great sex life even during the famiy bed years,  and a section on 'trouble shooting' that includes a great explanation of why \\"crying it out\\" is a terrible thing to do to babies.  It also covers transitioning a baby/child to their own bed and a great section on dealing with criticism from others.  It is very \\"breastfeeding positive\\" and approaches breastfeeding as the \\"normal\\" way to feed babies/toddlers.<br />Some folks have raised a concern over the chapter on helping an older baby/child sleep through the night.  This book did include Dr. Jay's \\"10 nights\\" plan to get a baby/child over 12 months of age to sleep through the night [for 7 hours].  It is *extremely* well done and the authors make it very clear that they would prefer you just leave the child to his/her own time table and relax about the whole thing.  They state clearly that they are only offering this as an alternative for families that are seriously considering 'cry it out' out of desperation and they give a great explanation of why this method is FAR preferable to the Cry It Out stuff.<br />The plan is VERY gentle - the baby/child is never left alone, parents maintain physical and voice contact with baby [first by nursing, after 3 nights cut out nursing but use holding/cuddling, on 7th night don't pick up but touch and rub back while talking soothingly to child, etc].  I think this plan is very in keeping with what is reasonable for a child over 12 months - and very gentle and Attachment Parenting  oriented.<br />\\"Good Nights\\" is VERY clear that family bed, breastfeeding and constant physical contact for babies are extremely beneficial and desirable and \\"sleep training\\" of any kind is strongly discouraged for all children but absolutely discouraged for a baby under 1 year of age.  The book also recognizes that children have different temperaments and that parents MUST be able to work with their child's temperament and that this plan might not work for all children and should be _immediately_ abandoned if it seems to be having a detrimental effect on a child.  This book is absolutely great and extremely AP.<br />I know several families that have used Dr. Jay's sleep plan with their children and it has worked very, very well for them and for their children.  I think it is a very gentle way to encourage less night waking for families who truly are desperate with frequent night waking toddlers.  I am extremely reluctant to use any kind of sleep training with my night waking children [I doubt I ever will], but if I did, I would feel good as an AP parent using Dr. Jay's steps.<br />This book is perfect for any family considering Co-Sleeping and would also be wonderful for any family who is rethinking a decision to solitary sleep and/or \\"cry it out\\".have different temperaments and that parents MUST be able to work with their child's temperament and that this plan might not work for all children and should be _immediately_ abandoned if it seems to be having a detrimental effect on a child.

Using the suggestions in the book to ensure that your child is receiving the love s/he needs will help build a better relationship no matter what the child's age or the parental circumstances.<br />The only complaint I had about the book was the chapter towards the end on \\"anger\\" - it is very poorly written and terribly confusing.  I'm still not sure what the heck it was supposed to be about. But with that brief exception, this is a PHENOMENAL book that has the power to help you vastly improve your relationship with your child/ren.<br />I also recommend \\"The Five Love Languages\\" [for couples] too - a strong relationship with your partner is a precious gift for your child/ren.

Dr. Cohen's ideas completely changed the tone of our household.  We were going through a very difficult phase with our 3 year old that was turning into a downward spiral of negativity.  Nobody liked the way things were going.  We'd read a mountain of &quot;discipline&quot; books, none of which was helpful in our situation.  However, reading &amp; following through on Dr. Cohen's book helped us completely turn our situation around - we now have a very HAPPY, joy-filled and fun home.  Using the suggestions in this book I was better able to understand my daughter's behavior and I used many of his suggestions to connect with her.  She has literally *blossomed* under this treatment - she's just a fantastic, happy little girl.<br />I am SO grateful to Dr. Cohen - he has helped me to become a much, much better parent and has given us a whole arsenal of wonderful parenting tools to help shape our children in very positive ways.

I'm very interested in a sleep solution that will help my children sleep. We use \\"Attachment Parenting\\" and were told that this book was very AP oriented.<br />This book was not as helpful as I had hoped, and was not as AP oriented as I would have liked. My major concerns are these:<br />1. The author gives very strong encouragement to introduce a \\"lovey\\" to get baby attached to, so baby can be comforted by lovey instead of mom. She even goes so far as to recommend putting the lovey *between* mom and baby when nursing, cuddling etc. [very symbolic IMO!] This really bugs me... I feel so strongly that our babies should be learning to attach to people, not things. I am truly, deeply uncomfortable with the idea of trying to force my child to become attached to an object so that he will be comforted by that object instead of me.<br />2. While not anti-family bed, she does basically say in the second half of the book that if you are co-sleeping you will have more nightwaking. She has a whole section on \\"transitioning your baby to a crib\\" and comparatively little on helping a baby/child cosleep and sleep soundly. She also says something to the effect that you can cosleep as long as you want, but that you should be prepared to endure more night waking if you do cosleep. None of the benefits of cosleeping were covered at all. I really kind of felt like cosleeping was being blamed as a cause of night waking and I don't really think that's true - I've seen too much anecdotal evidence of my cosleeping friends who have children who sleep 10 or 12 hours straight right there beside them.<br />3. Similarly, breastfeeding is sort of pointed to as a cause of night waking. Yes, a breastfed baby does wake more often to eat. But this book places _no_ value judgement on breast or bottle feeding - never once does she even note \\"though breastfed babies wake more often to eat, many mothers feel that the benefits of breastmilk over formula outweigh this factor by a huge measure\\" or anything like that. A new mom reading this book could *easily* think \\"well, I should just switch to a bottle and then I'll get some sleep!\\". I'm so uncomfortable with that. [And there are plenty of breastfed babies that DO sleep through the night after they are through the newborn stage].<br />4. There is very strong encouragement to put baby on a schedule. She emphasizes a \\"flexible schedule\\". I really hate to point this out, but I've read _Babywise_ several times [\\"know thy enemy\\"] and Ezzo's language is almost identical - he emphasizes what he calls a \\"flexible schedule\\". In fact, several things in this book echoed Babywise to my brain, which may account for my discomfort [justified or not justified!]. Not that I'm totally against a schedule, but as an AP parent I really think it is more useful to watch baby's cues...<br />5. There is strong discouragement from holding a sleeping baby. Pantley says this is undoubtedly a cause of nightwaking and should only be done very rarely if at all [for \\"special moments\\", but not as a routine]. I have enjoyed holding both my children as they slept for naps - its one of my favorite things - and if I have to give that up to get them to sleep at night, then I guess I just won't be sleeping until they are off to college or whatever. In my mind, this book absolutely & strongly contradicts the AP tradition of carrying baby in a soft carrier much of the time.<br />6. I also didn't like the whole section on training your baby to go back to sleep in the crib without you. It outlines a bunch of steps that begins with \\"pick him up\\", later you stop picking up and just place a hand on his back, then you just speak to him, then you speak to him from outside the door but don't go in, etc. This sounds much like Ferber sleep training to me, just minus the crying [and taking longer to acheive the same goal].<br />7. I felt like the author gave a lot of lip service to the \\"needs\\" of babies and how and why they wake, etc in the first half of the book [I was truly impressed in fact].  But then she totally disregards those things in the second half of her book under her \\"solutions\\" chapters. She says she is giving ideas to \\"encourage\\" baby to sleep [which I liked], but in truth, I really feel that this is just another \\"sleep training\\" book, albiet a MUCH nicer alternative to the \\"cry it out\\" methods.<br />Some of her other ideas are very helpful, though we are doing almost everything else she lists already, to no avail.<br />This book gives a very good explanation of why it is not a good idea to let babies \\"Cry It Out\\".  I think it would be extremely  helpful to families that are struggling with that decision.<br />This review is not meant as a criticism of *anyone* who uses this method - different things work for different families.  I know that many families have had great luck with this program and are very happy with it.

Books	2	104	123	N	Y	Wretched - Just An Elaborate Bribery System	I bought this book hoping for some insight on dealing with our three year old and her normal \\"three year old misbehavior\\".<br />I really enjoyed the first couple of chapters and I definitely support the idea that parents should \\"be\\" what they want their children to \\"become\\".  I liked his admonition to focus on the positive behavior and not the negative.  I also gleaned some other good advice here and there throughout the book.<br />However, once I got into the book, it became obvious that his \\"method\\" is based heavily on an elaborate bribery system [including numerous detailed tables of rewards for different age groups].  There is actually a chapter called \\"Never Give Away The Ice Cream\\" in which the author chastizes a family for taking their children out for ice cream.  He says that *nothing* should ever be given to children unless it is tied to their behavior as an award.  Forget unconditional love; quality family time for the sake of family time; or teaching children to do the right thing BECAUSE it is the right thing - this method is a sure fire way to teach your kids that nothing is worth doing unless they are being PAID to do it.<br />In my opinion, following the advice in this book is a great way to raise superficial, materialistic, self-serving brats who are guided not by their conscience, but by an external reward system.	2002-01-31

I have to say that it is something of a dissappointment.  There IS some useful info in the book [how to prepare for cooking day & freezing tips, etc], but it could all be contained in a 10 page booklet, easily.  [Not worth [price]by any stretch of the imagination].<br />The book begins with a short intro explaining the theory behind OAMC that is pretty helpful and then moves into the \\"menu cycles\\", which are highly repetitive [to the extreme]. [The book includes 3 two week cycles and 2 one month cycles].  You get the same \\"preparation\\" pages before each cycle, and many of the recipes are repeated two and three times.<br />The recipes themselves are a problem - most of them are loaded with fat and rely heavily on prepackaged \\"convenience foods\\" to cook [ie:  velveeta cheese, canned soup, refrigerated biscuit dough, roll dough, pizza dough, jarred salsa, etc] .  There is one two week \\"low fat\\" cycle included, but even that relies heavily on the convenience foods and most of them don't look very healthy to me.  [many of them just substitute \\"low fat\\" or \\"fat free\\" convenience foods for the regular stuff].<br />For anyone who would like to have a more healthful diet or who would prefer to cook \\"real\\" food from scratch, the recipes are useless.<br />I am glad I bought this book just in that I now understand the theory and can use it to adapt my own recipes to a 2 week or 30 day cycle, but I really can't recommend that anyone buy this book - check it out of your library and take what is useful to you.  It really isn't worth the price.  [Or, search on the internet - you could probably find more useful information on OAMC that way for free without even leaving your home].	2002-01-15

I ordered the book based on the reccomendation of a friend, but found it not very helpful because many of the things suggested violate my moral &amp; religious principles.  Some examples:  strong encouragement to practice extensive masturbation, use of pornography, use of vibrators and sex toys, the authors' stated conviction that &quot;monogamy is boring&quot; [I haven't found it so, wish I had the time and energy to jump my hubby every single night], etc.  It also might be worth noting that both authors spent 10 years working in a sex shop selling vibrators and sex toys - they have a *very* permissive perspective on sex, in my opinion.<br />I expected more help in the practicalities - I haven't lost my sex drive, I just seldom have any energy or time to cater to it, which I find frustrating.  I expected more on how to balance life with children and less on practices that aren't an option for me.  I'd really have appreciated more suggestions on making an opportunity to enjoy sex with my sexy husband instead of advice to masturbate more often.<br />This is not a criticism of *anyone's* morals or sexual beliefs.  For a person with a different frame of reference, this book would probably be extremely useful.  But I do think it is worth noting that some women might find it less useful [or downright offensive depending on how strict their beliefs are].  Those buyers should beware - this isn't the book for you.	2002-01-13

This book is awesome!  First of all, it is *beautiful*!  The art work is amazing - all the illustrations are done in clay, but in a wonderful way I've never seen before.  The illustrations are bright, eye catching, and very engaging.<br />Second, the way the book is done makes it extremely versatile.  On your first look through, you can read the names of all the objects pictured.  In your subsequent use, you can ask your child to find the objects pictured in the margins in the picture itself.  ie: &quot;Donde esta la mariposa?&quot;.  We use this book not only for learning Spanish, but also for sharpening observation skills [like a &quot;search&quot; book or &quot;I spy&quot; book].  And my child has to know the meaning of the word I'm using [ie: Mariposa] to know what to find in the photo - it makes the whole process extremely interesting to her and she really, really enjoys our Spanish lessons!<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough!	2002-01-05

The first few chapters of the book are dedicated to &quot;convincing&quot; the reader of how great homeschooling is. This is fine if you are just beginning to investigate the possibility, but, having already decided to homeschool, I found those chapters a little annoying and redundant.<br />In my opinion, the author spends too much time on general &quot;homeschooling is GREAT! Rah! Rah!&quot; and not enough time on the issues of substance [like, how exactly DO you homeschool an &quot;early years&quot; child?]. I would like to have seen more meaningful information shared - like evaluations of curriculums, more of what did and didn't work for other homeschoolers, and more practical advice. [The author goes into some of this to a very superficial degree, but does not delve deeply into any of these issues]. The advice on teaching subjects was also very general, though it was still helpful. The section on using computers and the community as resources were very good.<br />The &quot;statistical&quot; chapter that was included that places all the survey respondents on a continuum based on their homeschool style in several areas was particularly bad. The statistics are given but no discussion of why different families chose these styles or what they like or don't like about them. The chapter was also somewhat confusing - not helpful at all to me. [And I usually find that kind of stuff fascinating].<br />Like an earlier evaluator, I also felt that this book was unrealistically positive about Homeschooling - I agree that Homeschooling IS a great choice and overwhelmingly better than the public school alternative. However, there ARE some down sides [mother burn out for one!] and I would have appreciated a more honest discussion of these issues. The reader can't make a good decision without ALL the information - including the negatives.<br />So, for someone just beginning to investigate homeschooling, this would probably be a great book. If you've already investigated it and have been convinced to homeschool, you may want to skip this book - you may not get that much out of it.stigate homeschooling, this would probably be a great book.

On the positive side, it has great information on feeding your family more healthfully.  I've incorporated many of the suggestions into our diet and we are much better off for it.  This book also gives really good basic instructions on wholesome food preparation [the section on baking is especially great].<br />However, there are some problems with this book.  My biggest issue with the book is that many of the recipes I've tried from it have just been (disappointing).  Its very frustrating to spend a lot of time and energy on a recipe only to get a finished product that is inedible.  [The whole wheat biscuits were like hocky pucks, a couple of the bread recipes were just nasty].  I have to wonder if these recipes were actually tested before they were included [I think not].  I *have* had good success with some of the recipes [\\"David's Casserole\\" has become a favorite standard at our house, along with several others!], but it has been way too hit or miss for my tastes.<br />This book would be worth buying just for the instructional parts.  You are also supporting a great organization - La Leche League International - when you purchase it.  However, just keep in mind that every recipe you try might not be the greatest ever.	2001-10-31

All of the recipes I've tried from this book have been phenomenal, and they've also appealed to my hard-to-feed picky eater [always a plus!].<br />I've given this book as a gift to many of the talented cooks I know over the years and they never fail to come back to me with profuse thanks - it is a wonderful book that I'd recommend to anyone who loves to cook!	2001-10-31

The recipes are delectible [which isn't always true of the whole grain recipes I've tried from other sources].  This cookbook uses whole grains without being pretentious too [if you know what I mean... ].<br />Ken Haedrich is very entertaining throughout the book - its actually a fun read [how often can you say THAT about a cookbook?].  He educates without preaching and conveys the wonder and peace of baking your own goods - it really is wonderful.<br />I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and my family has LOVED all the recipes I've made from it.

The author gives clear and concise descriptions of various OB procedures and interventions that are easy to follow.  She gives pros and cons of each [working within her own bias, which she does freely admit].  I think this would be an excellent book for any couple expecting an uncomplicated birth to read.  This is information that every pregnant woman *should* have access to in order to make good decisions.<br />However, there is definitely an anti-OB bias [which the author admits] and this isn't a book designed to make you feel all warm and fuzzy about a hospital birth.  Be aware of that going into this - the author raises very important but possibly disturbing points for those planning a hospital birth with an Obstetrician in attendance.<br />My only dissappointment with the book is that there was no chapter on assisted delivery [vacuum cap and forceps].  I would very much have liked to see a chapter on the pros and cons of these common procedures and their safety for mother and baby.  There is only one page that has a small bit of information on this, but no extensive discussion or gathering of the research data available. It seems a glaring omission from an otherwise excellent and complete book.	2001-07-31

I'm always looking for new ideas and approaches to increase our intimacy and our joy with our marriage.<br />I have to say that this book is pretty useless to me though.  I'm not a &quot;control freak&quot; kind of person; I don't criticize my husband or try to control him; I adore and respect him; and we have an extremely balanced and equal relationship.  This book seems to me to be mostly about women who *are* very controlling in their relationships.  I can certainly see how this book would work for someone in that situation - SURRENDERING the control would certainly help, probably in exactly the manner the author claims.  I just don't think every single wife out there is suffering from these control issues, and for those of us who aren't - this book won't help.<br />Perhaps I should have known when I took her quiz in the beginning of the book and scored almost as high as possible on the &quot;good marriage&quot; end of the scale that I wouldn't really benefit from this book.  It was still interesting to read though. [I do disagree with some of the parts about keeping secrets and such - that's always detrimental to a good marriage in my opion].<br />For a woman who is in a troubled marriage and who does have &quot;control issues&quot;, I think this book might be a good place to start looking for a new perspective.  It would certainly be worth checking out at any rate.	2001-07-19

My two year old daughter loves the book and it really helped her understand what is going to happen at our upcoming birth.<br />The book is told from the perspective of the youngest child, a little boy, who is seeing birth for the first time.  [His two older sisters got to see him born].  The language and action are very appropriate for a young child [I can imagine my daughter doing and saying the same things].  The illustrations are unusual and wonderful - different from any I've seen before, but very eye catching and interesting.<br />This book has been very helpful to me in preparing our daughter for the birth of her sibling.

Following the exercises in this book will help couples work through their &quot;issues&quot; and prepare for the best birth possible for them.<br />This book contains all the information a couple needs to have regarding labor and delivery, but it also teaches the couple to think for themselves and shows them the way to learn what is truly important for them as individuals.  I am extremely grateful to have had this book in preparation for my second birth and wish I'd had it for my first.<br />The only drawback to this book is that parts of it get a little &quot;new-agey&quot; and may not appeal to a more &quot;mainstream&quot; person; but you can easily disregard anything that's too &quot;out there&quot; for you and still benefit *hugely* from having read the book and used the parts that worked for you.<br />The chapter on pain coping techniques is particularly phenomenal with some completely new approaches that are extremely good.  I especially like the fact that the author is HONEST about the pain of labor [and doesn't imply that it is just &quot;discomfort&quot; and that any woman who has pain with labor is just not &quot;doing it right&quot;.  ugh!] Having acknowledged that labor IS painful, the author then goes on to give you some amazing ideas on ways to cope with that pain.

It is also much better than the other 'standard' pregnancy books you'll find.<br />This book is a complete and joyful guide to what happens during pregnancy - mentally, emotionally, and physically - to mom and baby.  It has a great index; so if a specific symptom doesn't crop up in the exact month they cover it, you can easily look it up in the back and read about it.  I found this guide very informative and supportive of everything I'm going through with my second pregnancy.  [I wish I'd had this book for my first pregnancy, instead of that wretched &quot;what to expect&quot; book].<br />My one criticism of this book:  the Sears' gloss over the pain that most women experience during labor.  I didn't find the segment on labor very helpful or realistic.  As a Childbirth Educator myself, I don't feel that anyone is doing pregnant women a favor by convicing them that labor doesn't hurt - that it is just 'pressure' or 'discomfort'.  The reality is that for most women, labor IS painful - often extremely so.  Women who seek an unmedicated birth need to prepare themselves to cope with and overcome this pain.  And regardless of whether a woman expects to use medication or not,  nobody is doing her any favors by misleading her about labor pain - she's not going to thank them when it hits her full on.<br />For preparing for labor and delivery, I *highly* recommend &quot;Birthing From Within&quot; by Pam England.  It is much more realistic in preparing you for the &quot;Real Thing&quot; - and it is geared to help every woman work through her own issues and concerns about birthing.  It is by far the most excellent book out there on labor and delivery.<br />Other than that small complaint - I think this is a *wonderful* guide to pregnancy - very supportive and comforting while being very honest.	2001-06-03

The author is definitely biased [against disposable diapers, which I expected; but she also seems to think that everyone should use a diaper service, or if not, wool diapers/covers.  She doesn't seem to give fair judgement to some of the other great products out there].<br />This author also made home washing of diapers sound MUCH more difficult than it really is [maybe this is because of the bias towards using diaper services?].  If I didn't already know a lot about cloth diapers, I'd be frightened off by her description of laundering.  In reality, washing cloth diapers isn't much more difficult than washing the rest of baby's stuff. It certainly doesn't have to be the ordeal described in this book.<br />The whole book seems very opinionated more than factual, and sometimes the author's tone got on my nerves. That having been said, I found the Product and Resource listing in the last part of the book extremely useful.  The only problem is that it is somewhat dated now [I think the book came out in 1997].  Several of the numbers I tried to call that were listed were disconnected at this point.<br />I'd say this book is worth having for someone who is considering using cloth diapers, but overall it could be much better.	2001-05-15

It is a thorough introduction to &quot;Natural Parenting&quot; [which encompasses to some degree &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot;].  While I don't necessarily agree with everything in this book [Personally, I disagree with the stance against vaccinating], I found the book very useful and have continued to refer back to it over the months that I've owned it.  It covers a broad range of topics [everything from pregnancy and circumcision to raising children with healthy sexual identies and positive teenagers] and I imagine I'll be using it for years to come.  It has the best chapter on circumcision that I've ever read.  I've already loaned it to a couple of friends who were trying to make a decision about circumcision - and both decided not to.  This whole book would be useful to anyone who would like to raise healthy, happy children in a more natural way than our current &quot;pop parenting&quot; society would have it.  I think this book would be a welcome addition to any parenting library.	2001-03-22

My two year old daughter *loves* this book - she'd have me read it 20 times a day if I were willing.  This is a great book for explaining pregnancy and birth to a small child.  I also love the fact that it portrays the mom giving birth in what appears to be an upright [squating perhaps] position - very nice.  [You see mom's breasts, but nothing indiscreet or too graphic.]  It also shows mom nursing the new baby, which is very nice as well.  This is the best book on &quot;where babies come from&quot; for young children that I've found.  Our whole family really enjoys it!  [even after about 957 readings....]  :)	2001-02-04

The illustrations are very colorful and vibrant.  I love the fact that she is learning about different cultures in a fun context.  We really enjoy reading this book togther and discussing the pictures and what the babies and mommies and daddies and grandparents are doing.  This is a truly wonderful book that depicts babies as a sweet part of daily life - not seperate from it.  This book also validates our way of life for our daughter [breastfeeding and carrying her in a sling].  Its a really nice book all the way around.  I look forward to reading it for years to come.<br /><br />Update 11/2010 - ten years later and we still read this book on a regular basis.  I am on \\"baby\\" #6 now, who is the current \\"two year old\\" and she loves this beautiful book just as much as the first baby did - and all the babies in between.  This is a timeless, wonderful book.  Buy it!  :)	2000-12-09

I feel like this book has changed me and changed my life - for the better!  This book is exactly what I needed in my life at this moment.  Victoria Moran has written more than a &quot;how to keep house&quot; book here - she has written a book that can help each of us fully enjoy our lives.  She gives wonderful insight on things we can do to change our lives from hectic, frantic, and stressed out to serene and full of joy.  Her suggestions are all &quot;DO-able&quot; suggestions - requiring nothing more major than a change of attitude.  I am so grateful to Ms. Moran for writing this book - it has touched me deeply and I feel that my life will be much more appreciated from now on.  I plan to sit down and re-read this book every year or so from now on to remind myself of what is REALLY important and to keep my priorities in line.<br />I loved this book so much that I just purchased eight copies to give every single one of my best girlfriends &amp; treasured family members - I wish I could buy a copy for everyone in the whole world!	2000-11-21

I wish I'd had it two years ago when we were just beginning to consider Homeschooling.  I think this would be the perfect book to start with for anyone who is curious about Homeschooling or is just beginning to look into it.  This is also the book I'm going to give to all of my child's Grandparents to try to help them understand it better.<br />While this is an excellent book for &quot;beginners&quot;, this book was also very useful to me even though I knew a lot about Homeschooling already.  I still got a bunch of good info and inspiration from this book.  I REALLY enjoyed it and I think I'll probably refer back to it for years to come.	2000-11-14

It is extremely informative and thorough, while managing to make nutrition very interesting.  It is easy to read and understand.  I've really enjoyed the fact that this book goes into such detail explaining why certain foods are great and others are bad - while holding my attention all the while!  I have found the book very easy to use as a reference when I've come back to it and it is full of very useful suggestions.<br />I'm not a really strict person when it comes to diet for my daughter - hey, I even let the grandparents give her chocolate and cookies sometimes.  But I do like the fact that this book gave me a lot of information that helped make me a better parent [nutritionally speaking].  I follow what works for us and don't worry about what I can't incorporate into our diet right now.<br />This book did not make me feel guilty - on the contrary it made me feel knowledgeable enough to make the choices right for our particular family.  I feel pretty good about our diet in general, and on occaision when I find our menu falling prey to too much &quot;convenience food&quot;, I go back and read a bit of this book and regain my motivation to work towards healthy food, regardless of how busy I am.  I'm really glad I have this book!  It is by far the most interesting and useful book on nutrition I've found.	2000-11-02

Books	1	36	38	N	Y	Not Fit For Sale	I practice Attachment Parenting and *strongly* support it.  Attachment Parenting has worked wonders in our family.  I bought this book because it was listed in my &quot;recommendations&quot; section on amazon.com and it sounded great [I bought it about a year ago before any of the negative reviews you see here were posted].<br />This is the worst book I've ever paid money for.  It is full of typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, sentence fragments - it is truly wretched.  I was so angry that I spent the price of the book plus shipping for it - I felt horribly ripped off.  This book is extremely poorly written and not worth the time it took to try to read it.  [It had so many mistakes in it that it was extremely difficult to even attempt to read].  A year later I'm still annoyed at the time and money I wasted on this book.  While the author seems genuinely passionate about the subject and is attempting to do a good thing in writing this book, I don't think this book is near the quality it needs to be before she takes people's money for it.  I strongly suspect that many of the positive reviews posted here come from friends or family of the author - I can't see how an objective reader could recommend this book to anyone in good conscience.<br />Attachment Parenting is a wonderful subject and fully worth reading about, but if you want a good [GREAT] book on the subject, do yourself a favor and skip this one completely - read &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; by Katie Allison Granju or *any* Dr. William Sears book.  Those are dollars and hours you'll be very glad you spent.	2000-11-01

This book teaches the Fertility Awareness Method - a way of using a woman's physical symptoms to determine [with great accuracy] when she is fertile and when she is not.  You can use this to either postpone pregnancy or acheive it.  My husband and I have used this for two years now with perfect results, and two of my girlfriends who were dealing with infertily conceived ONE MONTH after I explained this method to them.  [Both now have healthy babies to show for it!].  This book is well written, easy to understand, and very interesting!<br />I think every woman should have a copy of this book - it is criminal that we aren't even taught the rudimentary facts about how our bodies work!!  Every couple should have a copy of this book so that both partners can understand their fertility.<br />My one complaint or comment:  This book teaches you to use a barrier method of birth control during the Fertile Time.  I have a personal problem with that though - if you use a condom to have intercourse while you are FERTILE, you are going to reduce your effectiveness rating drastically because condoms are much less effective than using FAM and avoiding intercourse during the fertile time.  You can still get pregnant based on the failure rate of the condom [which is somewhere between 71-80% effective depending on the study your read] as opposed to the 99% effectiveness rating of FAM using abstinence.  Just keep that in mind.<br />I love this book - you'll never be sorry for buying this one!!	2000-10-22

We learned the method from the Couple to Couple League [who publishes this book].  It changed our lives [MUCH for the Better] and we love using NFP.  I tell everyone I can about how great NFP is and I think every single woman in the world has a right to know about it - FREE birth control that is HIGHLY effective without any negative side effects.  You just can't beat it.<br />That having been said, this book in particular is a great place to start if you are looking for information on the science and biology behind NFP and how it works, as well as all the study information on its effectiveness.  I must admit my husband and I were VERY skeptical at first, and this book gave us all the scientific evidence we needed to be convinced.  No other book I've found is as comprehensive as this one in explaining the science/biology behind NFP.<br />However, there are some problems with this book.  If you are not a Christian you will probably find the religious stuff annoying or useless.  The authors are devoutly Catholic, but they are writing to all Christians - so this book should be fairly appealing to anyone with a Christian belief system.<br />I also found the book organized poorly and the index in the back is totally inadequate.  It is frustrating to try to find specific facts in the book when going back to use it as a reference.  I think this book might be much harder for a lay person to understand without taking an actual class on NFP [which I would recommend anyway].<br />The bottom line - you can't beat this book for facts, figures, and scientific data, but you will also get a heavy dose of religion and a confusing layout.	2000-10-22

She had colic so severe [crying 10-12 hours a DAY for first 12 weeks!] that our Pediatrician told us &quot;This isn't colic, she just has a bad disposition.&quot; [UGH - we don't use him any more needless to say - and the crying stopped abruptly at 12 weeks].  After the colic passed, she continued to be a VERY &quot;hands on, high need&quot; baby.  She was quite a challenge to parent that first year.<br />Thank goodness I found this book!  I can still remember the first time I read it - the sigh of relief that I wasn't alone and the wonder at all the great ideas and suggestions in the book.  We put these suggestions to work in our parenting and followed Dr. Sears' advice to the letter.  Now we have an angelic two year old - she's a joy to be around.  She is now the easiest kid in the world to parent - the most easy going, friendly, and sweet kid you could imagine.  Now my friends all say how lucky I am to have such an easy toddler!  I think it is due in great part to Dr. William and Martha Sears and their wonderful insight and advice - their suggestions certainly worked for us!	2000-10-20

That having been said, I have thoroughly enjoyed this book [all THREE times I read it - and I'll probably re-read it again sometime when I need another lift].  I laughed until I cried reading this book and it ALWAYS gives me a fresh outlook on whatever stage I'm dealing with.<br />I don't advise using this book as your primary manual to caring for a Toddler.  There are much better books out there for that purpose [In My Opinion - &quot;The Discipline Book&quot;, &quot;How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk&quot;, as well as &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot;].  But if you could really use a laugh and help getting some perspective on these hectic, crazy toddler years - this is the perfect book for it.  [And what mother of a toddler couldn't use a laugh?!!]  I've read all of Vicki's books [and enjoyed them], but this one is my favorite.<br />It seems from reading the reviews that people either love Vicki or hate her.  I don't really understand the polarization.  I think she's simply a very funny person who doesn't claim to be *anything* more than she is - just one mom who has been there and is sharing one way of coping.  She repeatedly emphasizes that she's not a Physician, Psychologist, etc.  I don't think people should take her books so seriously - they are meant to be funny, and they succeed brilliantly.<br />One thing that does carry forth very plainly in her books though:  Vicki loves children very much and encourages us to parent with compassion.  You can't fault her for that - this world could certainly use a little more compassion.	2000-10-19

[With so many other rooms in the house, I'm amazed at some of the other reviewers who say they couldn't have a sexual relationship with their husbands... We've certainly not had that problem.]  Our family is a very close and happy one, and my husband and I love nothing better than waking up all cuddled up together with our sweet little toddler in the mornings.  I'd recommend the &quot;Family Bed&quot; [or &quot;Co-sleeping&quot;; &quot;Sharing Sleep&quot;] to any family that would like a close knit, loving, happy family unit.<br />That having been said, I kind of hate this book.  While I suppose it is something of a &quot;Classic&quot;, I dislike the author's language on the subject [she does seem to rant and rave a bit, which is unneccessary and annoying in my opinion].  I disliked her chapter on Sex [seeming to think it was unneccessary between spouses or that there was something wrong with wanting to have sex with your husband - as opposed to offering good advice on how to have a great sex life AND a Family Bed].  She also makes a couple of allusions to sex WITH children that made my skin crawl.  I found parts of this book very upsetting and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, regardless.<br />If you want some great books on Co-sleeping or &quot;Family Beds&quot;, check out &quot;Three in a Bed&quot; by Deborah Jackson, and &quot;Night Time Parenting&quot; or any of several other books by Dr. William Sears &amp; his wife Martha - I found these MUCH more helpful, sane, and constructive.	2000-10-17

This is a great place to find irrefutable support not only for the &quot;Family Bed&quot; but also for Attachment Parenting [or &quot;Natural&quot; Parenting].<br />I wish I'd had this book two years ago when my child was an infant.  Unfortunately I just discovered it a few months ago.  While I still enjoyed reading it, I would have gotten more out of it as a &quot;beginner&quot; co-sleeper.  My only complaint was that I wish there was more of the &quot;Practical&quot; section.  What is there is great, but I really feel like the author could probably write a whole book just on the practicalities of co-sleeping.  In fact, that's a book I'd *love* to see on the market!	2000-10-17

This book was also very encouraging and supportive of Co-sleeping, which is how our family sleeps.  This would make a great starting point for anyone considering Co-sleeping, or anyone frustrated with their child's sleep problems after using some of the more common &quot;sleep training&quot; methods popular in the USA today.  I got a lot from this book.<br />My one complaint, however, is that there really needs to be more practical information on making Co-sleeping work.  I'd like to see a book with more information on the daily ins and outs of co-sleeping and especially dealing with special situations.  We've been extremely happy with our sleep arrangement and with the way our daughter is turning out, but I would love to see something offering us more &quot;hands on&quot; support and advice for our Co-sleeping arrangement.

That having been said, I give this book [either loaned or as a gift] to every pregnant Girlfriend I have.  Its just simply hilarious.<br />This is NOT the book you use as your &quot;real&quot; guide to pregnancy.  You should have another book [I would suggest &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Dr. Sears] for that purpose.  But if you crave some humor and a great feeling of camraderie, this is a wonderful book for &quot;light reading&quot;.  I've read my copy several times and I know I'll re-read it with my next pregnancy.  It is a fun read all the way around.<br />I do get a little annoyed with a couple of things - the author was apparently a Size 4 when she got pregnant and she goes on and on about how &quot;fat and huge&quot; she got when pregnant [gaining 40 pounds].  Later in the book, you find out that she went all the way up to a [GASP!] size 10 while pregnant.  For many of us a size 10 is great on a non-pregnant day and I found that a little insulting.  [I'd never think of a size 10 as &quot;huge and fat&quot; personally].<br />I also thought she portrayed her husband as a jerk and not very supportive of her pregnancies.  This got generalized to all &quot;daddies to be&quot; in my opinion.  My experience [and that of many women I know] was that of having an amazingly supportive and enthusiastic husband/partner.  Some guys just don't get into the pregnant thing I guess, but I didn't like the general tone I got regarding daddies in this book.  [I think daddies are extremely important].<br />Other than those two beefs though, I thought the book was wonderful.  I laughed out loud non-stop and it was just generally a mood lifter for me [and for my Girlfriends who have read it at my suggestion].  I think you can really enjoy this book if you don't take it at all seriously.	2000-10-11

This book was wonderful!  It really motivated me to get organized.  I enjoyed reading it [it is &quot;easy reading&quot; - the author writes very well] and couldn't wait to get started organizing our family.  This book is exactly what I needed to get myself going.<br />One thing that really helped me was the chapter on throwing stuff away.  I never realized that I had such pack-rat like tendencies till I read this book.  I am now a firm believer in throwing stuff away [or recycling it, giving it to charity, etc] and our home is so much more uncluttered and nice to live in.<br />She has so many great ideas in this book that it would be impossible to list all the ways I've been helped by it.  She does have some ideas that didn't work for me [I spent a long time trying to organize my recipes and shopping like she suggested, but it just didn't work for me], but they might work for others.  I found this a great book to use on a &quot;take what works, leave what doesn't&quot; basis.

So, of course, I ran out and bought it the moment my pregnancy test was positive!  But, honestly, I didn't think it was that helpful.<br />The second chapter is titled &quot;Now that you are Pregnant&quot; and most of that chapter deals with &quot;what you may be concerned about&quot; which could also be titled &quot;everything that could possibly go horribly wrong with your pregnancy&quot; and it scared me half to death.  I think it increased the amount of worrying I was doing exponentially [which couldn't have been a good thing!].<br />I also thought the diet portion was pretty ridiculous.  I agree that we need to eat very healthily, especially during pregnancy.  I eat very well and I ate especially well when pregnant.  However, no human being I've ever met could [or would] stick to this diet plan.  It was so strict as to be useless, in my opinion.  I think people do much better with a &quot;eat well 90% of the time and let yourself fudge a little the other 10%&quot; kind of plan.  But the diet stuff DID succeed in making me feel really, really guilty for the duration of my pregnancy if I ate anything that was not whole grain, organic, and laced with a heaping spoonful of Wheat Germ.<br />I also didn't think this was a very good guide to the &quot;labor and delivery&quot; part of the pregnancy, which was a big concern for me.  This book was very &quot;medical&quot; in its outlook on labor and delivery and didn't go into very much detail about the process, really.  I found &quot;A Good Birth, A Safe Birth&quot; to be much more useful, as well as &quot;The Birth Book&quot; by Sears.<br />All in all, this would be a good book to have on hand as a reference, just in case there were problems with the pregnancy, but I wouldn't buy it as your primary guide to pregnancy.  For my second pregnancy, a friend recommended &quot;The Pregnancy Book&quot; by Sears and I found that MUCH more helpful honestly.ound that MUCH more helpful honestly.	2000-10-08

I was really impressed with the fantastic ideas and it was very helpful that the author broke everything down into easily achievable steps.  This is a GREAT book and I recommend it to anyone who is the least interested in playing in the dirt with their child!	2000-09-27

For any mother who is even just *thinking about* breastfeeding - this would be the book to buy! [And if you are already sure you want to breastfeed, this is the greatest book for you too!] <br />When I got pregnant with my daughter almost 3 years ago, I told my husband I was not going to breastfeed because I thought it was &quot;Icky&quot; and &quot;Weird&quot;.  [Its true - that was my opinion!  Nobody I knew had ever breastfed and I'd never even seen it done - it seemed really strange to me].  The more I read about taking care of my baby though, the more I realized I ought to at least investigate breastfeeding since it really is the &quot;superior infant food&quot;.  Of course I wanted the best for my baby, so I thought I'd better at least read a little about it.   I bought &quot;So That's What They're For!&quot; simply because the title was funny - I had NO CLUE whether it would be a good book to buy.  I was SO LUCKY that this is the one I bought!   Janet Tamaro brought me full circle from thinking &quot;Yuck!  Breastfeeding!&quot; to &quot;Wow, I think I would like to breastfeed for a couple of months!&quot;.   This book was so non-judgemental and universally friendly that it wasn't threatening to me [like some books would have been for me at that time].  It really put out the benefits vs. annoyances in a very straightforward and humorous way that appealed to me so much.  <br />The funny thing is, once my baby was born I *DID* breastfeed.  I had several serious problems in the beginning, but I worked through them and after a few weeks, breastfeeding went great. I met my original goal of 3 months and decided to keep breastfeeding until 6 months.  6 months came and went and I decided to go for the full year recommended as the minimum by the American Academy of Pediatrics - which I did!  My baby is so healthy and happy and breastfeeding was such a wonderful thing for us.I ended up nursing my baby well past her first birthday.   I've now become something of a breastfeeding advocate and have helped other mothers [friends, family, and complete strangers!] to breastfeed successfully since.  <br />I've read and re-read and refered back to this book countless times.  I feel like a large part of my success is because of Janet Tamaro and her book - if I ever meet this woman I owe her a HUGE THANK YOU!!!!  I'm so very glad I happend upon her book!	2000-09-27

This book is exactly what I needed - its full of fresh, creative, and wonderful ideas of things I can do with my child.  I pull it out on those days when we are both bored and driving each other crazy - I don't know how I would survive without it now that I have a busy, curious, and easily bored two year old around!  We have so much fun with this book and I highly recommend it to every parent out there!	2000-09-27

I quickly purchased my own copy from amazon.com after reading it.  It is an amazing book - it really did change the way I parented my daughter [for the better] and it also really REALLY worked for child spacing purposes.  I was fascinated with the information in this book [which I'd never read or even heard of elsewhere] and it was fun and easy to read.  I also really REALLY enjoyed being without periods for more than a year too.  :)  I think any breastfeeding mom would really benefit from reading this book!	2000-09-26

I read the first edition of this book when my daughter was about 8 months old and it helped me make the decision that it would be OK to keep nursing her past 12 months if I wanted to.  I re-read the first edition when she was about 14 months old for practical advice and reassurance.  I have since purchased the new edition [which is even better!], and I've returned to it many times over the last year.  I've used it as a reference whenever I had a question, and I just recently re-read the whole thing as my daughter's second birthday began to approach.  I've certainly gotten my money's worth out of this book and I recommend it to any mother who is contemplating nursing past the first birthday.	2000-09-24

I found that very interesting.  More than 90 pages of the book are devoted to how to wean a baby who is less than 12 months old - which might be helpful to many moms, but is useless to anyone who is nursing a baby older than that.  I found the book to be VERY honest and direct on both the pros and cons of weaning in each age category [0-4 mos, 5-12 mos, 1-2 yrs, 3 and older].  The author was very supportive of a mother's wish to wean [or not], regardless of her reasons and gave the facts about the benefits and costs of the decision in a very forthright and non-judgemental fashion.  She included a huge number of practical tips on weaning in different situations and for different reasons.  She offered information on every choice available without judgement - including some methods condemned by most Breastfeeding Advocates - such as weaning by &quot;abandonment&quot;, applying disgusting or pain-inducing substances to the breast to traumatize the baby out of wanting to nurse, and weaning by frightening the baby.  I didn't care for those methods, but she was certainly honest and thorough on ALL the options available.  She gave many, many tips on methods that might be more healthy for the baby as well, and I felt the book was very complete.	2000-09-24

Its easy to read and very interesting [and a pretty quick read].  As a mother who has made the choice to continue to breastfeed past the first 12 months of my daughter's life, it was really reassuring to find a book like this.  It gave me very practical information on how to decide when to wean and great ideas on how to achieve weaning when the time comes.  I also really enjoyed reading the stories of many other mothers and babies and how they achieved weaning.	2000-09-24

He states &quot;we almost managed to cause permanent harm with well-intentioned strategy of Dr. Sears&quot;.  I feel it is only fair to point out that based on the details of his review, he did NOT actually use Dr. Sears' strategy at all - they did not breastfeed or share sleep; and the babies were separated from mom and dad early on because they unfortunately had to go to ICU.  That means he didn't practice at least three of the five  most important tenants of Attachment Parenting [the other two tenants are baby wearing and responding to baby's cues - which he doesn't mention].  Therefore, while I do understand the frustration he feels, he can't, in all fairness, blame his children's issues on Dr. Sears or Attachment Parenting.<br />I have a wonderful friend who has used &quot;The Baby Book&quot; to raise two twin daughters with beautiful success and I know that many parents of multiples use Attachment Parenting with great success.  It does take more effort with twins certainly [as does *any* parenting style when you multiply the babies!], but it is definitely possible [and desireable for many families].<br />If anyone wants more information on breastfeeding and using Attachment Parenting specifically for twins and higher order multiples, check out &quot;Mothering Multiples:  Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More!&quot; by Karen Gromada.  The author herself raised her two grown twin sons using Attachment Parenting and the book is based on the experiences of hundreds of families who successfully used Attachment Parenting to parent their multiples.  It should be a very helpful book to anyone expecting more than one infant!  Combined with Dr. Sears' Baby Book, families should have a great beginning towards success.d with Dr. Sears' Baby Book, families should have a great beginning towards success.	2000-09-23

When I was pregnant with my daughter, we were overwhelmed by all the &quot;How To Parent&quot; Baby Books on the market.  I read just about every one I could get my hands on [everything from Dr. Spock to Ezzo].  Then a friend gave me a copy of Dr. Sears' Baby Book and I'm so grateful!!  We've used Dr. Sears' &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; with our daughter from the beginning with amazing results.  I have to admit that in the first few months of life it WAS a very demanding job - but I also feel now that the payoff was more than worth the sleepless nights and effort of those first few months.  We have a daughter who is now TWO years old - supposedly the &quot;terrible twos&quot;.  I was really dreading it because of all the horror stories I'd read about how awful two year olds are.  But now I refer to it as the &quot;Terrific Twos&quot; because my little girl is so SWEET!  She's a joy to be around - she's very polite [please, thank you, may I please... ] and very, very kind [are you OK mommy?  I love you mommy!  God Bless You Mommy].  She plays well with other children, shares her toys, and is very sweet to them.  She's so well behaved that I almost never have a care [unless she's sick or teething, then she's a little cranky, but I think all kids are].   She's obedient, gentle, friendly, confident, and just a blast to be around.  People stop me in grocery stores, shopping malls, and even in our Gymboree classes to tell me how amazingly well behaved she is, how sweet she is, and how lucky we are to have such a nice little girl.  I agree - we are EXTREMELY lucky.  But I also must say that I think Dr. Sears gets a lot of credit.  Following his methods made my husband a better father, made me a much better mother than I ever would have been, and has made our little girl everything we could wish for.  I'm so glad now that I didn't give in to outside pressure and continued to stick by Attachment Parenting.  I'm looking forward to a lifetime of joy watching my little Sweety grow up and I can very enthusiastically recommend this method to ALL new parents who want sweet, well behaved kids.	2000-09-22

Books	2	22	26	N	Y	Good Content - Terrible Editing	This is a pretty good book.  I agree with Ms. Frissell-Deppe's philosophy on childrearing and I think she does have a good &quot;over view&quot; of attachment parenting in this book.  The book is also a pretty quick read,  which is nice for new parents who don't have bunches of free time.   However, the editing and proofreading are terrible - the book is *full* of  errors (I've found errors on almost every page).  Sentence fragments,  grammatical errors, spelling errors, obvious key words left out of  sentences so that the reader is left wondering what exactly the author was  intending to say...   I haven't purchased a book this full of errors ever  before (and boy, I've purchased a bunch of books in my lifetime!).  This  book reads much more like a first draft than something that was edited,  proofread, corrected, and ready for sale.   Also, some of the &quot;real  life parent&quot; comments seem a little irrelevant or redundant (although  some are interesting).  I do agree with the author's premise and she is  obviously passionate about attachment parenting - and the book has a good  concept behind it. However, I also felt that the author came accross as  extremely defensive of attachment parenting and somewhat confrontational.   I think that the happy, healthy, well behaved children that result from  attachment parenting speak for themselves - there is no need for  defensiveness in practicing a truly *excellent* parenting style.  This book  needs several rewrites with attention to detail before I feel it is ready  for sale to the general public.  I was terribly dissappointed in the  quality of the writing.  The editorial errors made it difficult and  frustrating for me to read.  I wouldn't mind this if I had been reading the  author's personal web site, but since I *paid* for this book, I expected a  bit more.  I suggest a revision and then the author will have a darn good  guide to Attachment Parenting for the general public.  Until then, I'd have  to recommend&quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; by Granju.	2000-01-08

However, it is also gets pretty in depth into evolutionary science and biology.  I have enjoyed that quite a bit and  learned an awful lot, but it is definitely not light reading as far as that  goes.  It is more scientific than I expected, which I actually like a great  deal, but it is different from what I originally thought I was buying.  This book is less of a &quot;how to raise your child&quot; type book and  more of an &quot;evolutionary and biological cross cultural study of  infants and children and how different child rearing practices influence  personality and culture&quot;.  Which I found absolutely fascinating  myself.  I highly recommend the book - but with the caveat that you need  time to sit down and concentrate on it, which is hard to do with small  children around!	2000-01-01

If you would like to read a truly Biblical book on Christian parenting, please try &quot;The Complete Book of  Christian Parenting and Child Care&quot; by William and Martha Sears.  It  is based *strongly* in The Bible and is filled with great scriptural  references that I have found very helpful and encouraging.  &quot;Christian  Parenting and Child Care&quot; is truly GOD'S WAY, and it is fantastic.  My  daugher is a blessing to be with, a joy to all who meet her, and I  constantly receive compliments on how well behaved, friendly, and charming  she is.<br />I would be Afraid and Ashamed to meet my Lord and Savior on  Judgement Day had I abused the children he intrusted into my care in the  way that BabyWise suggests.

Some of the practices encouraged in this book are being proven to  be *dangerous* to babies by all the new &quot;cutting edge&quot; studies.   Most of the other practices advocated in this book, if not dangerous, are  just bad parenting. I read this book because it was recommended to me by my  instructors as something I should read to know what NOT to do with infants  and babies.   Please do your child a favor and skip this one.   Read  &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by Dr. William Sears [who is being widely  supported by the newest research into baby's brain and emotional  development, as well as general physical well being].  Or check out  &quot;Attachment Parenting&quot; by Granju.   This book it a quick fix for  &quot;convenient&quot; baby care which will eventually lead to some really  unhappy families.   There is no &quot;Easy Way Out&quot; with parenting -  you either do it right [which might be a little inconvenient at times - buy  why have a child if you want convenience?  Get a fish!] or you spend the  rest of your child's life making up for past mistakes and trying to do  damage control [probably unsuccessfully].   The happiest, healthiest, most  WELL BEHAVED children I know are the ones whose parents used Attachment  Parenting.  PLEASE think long and hard before you buy into this &quot;easy  answer&quot; method of screwing up kids.   I promise you and your child  will be happier if you do.	1999-12-08

We are attachment parenting our 13 month old and this book gives a multitude of information and sources for the &quot;cutting edge&quot; research that SUPPORTS attachment parenting. I will be showing this book to my family and friends who have criticized our sharing sleep and extended breastfeeding - it will be pretty hard for them to keep arguing when I have the *facts* to show them and the sources to cite. This book will help us tremendously in defending what we already know is right. Other books may be better for in-depth, detailed &quot;how toos&quot; on attachment parenting [&quot;The Baby Book&quot;, &quot;Nightime Parenting&quot; &amp; &quot;The Discipline Book&quot; -all by Sears, &quot;Mothering Your Nursing Toddler&quot;, and &quot;Three in a Bed&quot; for instance], but this is the best all around up-to-the-minute defense of attachment parenting I've read yet. The contact information on various helpful organizations is invaluable and I have already made great use of it. This book is definitly going into my baby-shower gift bags from now on!	1999-10-06
