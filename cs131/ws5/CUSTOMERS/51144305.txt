It contains lots of projects that are fairly quick to knit; most of the projects are scarves.  Most of the yarns used are the novelty yarns that are currently popular, and many patterns offer alternate yarns to use.  Although I've discovered one project calls for an elasticized ribbon yarn that is discontinued (good luck finding that!).  Many great small projects made in a few hours, to fun larger projects that might take a couple of weeks.  Great book for beginning to intermediate knitters.	2004-12-29

Vogue Knitting: The Ultimate Knitting Book is definitely an important reference for the beginning to intermediate knitter to have on hand, but tread carefully into the more advanced areas of the book, such as the section on designing your own sweater.  I'm currently knitting a sweater of my own creation and have been using the designing section for determining the increases and decreases throughout my project.  I find the instructions very confusing and somewhat lacking whereas better clarification is needed to determine the appropriate increases and decreases; try reading the instructions for determining the increases and decreases when you really need it, and you too, will be confused.  Making things a bit more complicated, are the couple of typos in the designing section, and when you design your own, every calculation is important to get right.  In the end, when things just get a bit too confusing, I just end-up relying on my knitting experience to get the portion of the sweater I'm working on to work out fine.    Aside from the questionable designing section, the rest of the book (most of it) has much to offer those new to knitting, especially with clear graphics and lots (hundreds?) of color photos to instruct and encourage creativity.  Some of the questions it answers are:  What is blocking and how do I do it? What do the international care symbols found on yarn labels mean? What do knitting abreviations mean? Why make a swatch for stitch gauge? What are some of the different methods of knitting? How do I add color? What are some stitch patterns? How do I correct dropped stitches? How is a buttonhole made? How do I cast on and bind off?    The book only very briefly covers novelty yarns which are so popular right now, and so it doesn't really get into how to incorporate them and mix them with other yarns into a project.    Here's an overview of the table of contents:  History of Knitting  Knitting Supplies:  Yarns and Tools  Basic Techniques  Understanding Knitting Instructions  Correcting Errors  Circular and Double-Pointed Knitting  Color Knitting  Blocking, Assembling and Finishing  Care of Knitwear  Stitch Dictionary  Designing  Embellishments  Modular Knitting Patterns  Traditional Knitting Patterns  Index    The Modular Knitting section takes a basic sweater pattern and gives the knitter the opportunity to swap out different styles of collar, sleeves and overall looks.    Traditional Knitting Patterns section is simply a collection of six beautiful and seemingly timeless patterns that many long-time readers of Vogue Knitting Magazine will recognize from past issues, some designed by Oscar de la Renta, DKNY, and Isaac Mizrahi.    I can't say that it is a \\"must have\\" book for every knitter's library, but it is definitely worth having.	2004-10-02

The Washington Popout Map is comprised of a total of 5 maps: a map of Old Town Alexandria (in nearby Virginia), an enlarged map of the Georgetown neighborhood, a map of Greater Washington (which covers about 85% of the city), an enlarged map of the downtown area and a map of the subway system.  I used the map extensively during my week-long visit to Washington, during which I rode the subway system everyday, and took a tour bus to Old Town Alexandria.<br />I get a Popout Map for most cities I go to that they're available for, mainly because if I am going to spend any decent amount of time in the downtown area of a major city I want something that is not as big as a standard road map, and folds quickly and easily.  Not only that, but traditional maps are big, even when folded, and in some situations I like to advertise too much that I am from out of town (i.e., lost).  The Popout Maps help me keep a low profile, tuck easily into a coat pocket when closed (folds to about 3.5&quot;x5&quot;), help locate the major tourist attractions (government buildings, museums, university, neighborhood divisions, historic places, and major shopping areas), as well as easy to read street names and a map of the city transit system.  It even has a small index of streets, places of interest, and a few phone numbers (museums, visitor's center, convention center, rail, subway, major tour companies, and airports).<br />No, the Popout Maps aren't going to get you everywhere in a major metropolitan area (e.g., the suburbs), but they are extremely handy and quick to use for the center of town.  It is helpful to have a standard map in your hotel room to cross reference when you want to travel out of the downtown core.  <br />The only downside to the Popout Maps, as with any map, is that they can tear easily if you handle them roughly, although when folded the cardstock of the outer cover is fairly durable.	2003-10-27

Jennifer Finney Boylan's book offers a look into the true story of the life of a transgendered person.  In it she recounts her struggles to be male, all the while feeling inherently female in the wrong body.  As a mismatched mind and body, the author gives the reader a sense of the confusion that results, that is, until the day James realizes that, he would be happier if he became a woman.  From childhood through adulthood, including marriage as a man to a woman and fatherhood, Ms. Boylan takes the reader through the process of hormone therapy and surgery to become Jennifer, all the while gently and lovingly working through the bumps of taking longstanding relationships along for the ride.<br />Boylan presents her life story with sensitivity, warmth and humor making it a very good read.  I recommend this book for its entertainment value and the opportunity it presents to educate the reader about this little known condition.	2003-07-30

I have a very fragile 1900 edition of Vitalogy and it's unfortunate that it is so old because it's great fun to look at.  I used to look at it as a kid and marvel at the strange admonitions it contains, such as warning against chewing gum since spitting your saliva is hazardous to your health.  Of course, I don't know of many people that chew gum and spit saliva at the same time, but it's pretty fun stuff to read.  There's also the warning against marrying someone with narrow nostrils, as it \\"indicates small lungs.\\"  How about \\"Red whiskered men should marry brunettes, but not blondes, the color of the whiskers being more determinate of the temperament than the hair\\"?  There are all kinds of remedies offered including the prevention of baldness (use French or German green soap--whatever that is).  Definitely a book for the coffee table.	2003-05-30

A Girl Named Zippy is a pleasant journey through childhood in simpler times in Middle America before the introduction of video games, cell phones, compact disks, and personal computers (and all that they stand for); even that good old stand-by, the TV, didn't feature very prominently in Zippy's life.  In these pages, you'll find the world from the viewpoint of a child, complete with eccentric grown-ups, childhood antics, pets, and the occasional creepy neighborhood kid (I could relate to that!).  There were pleny of slow spots, particularly when the details of some events were a bit too drawn-out, leaving me with the feeling that the book was just a bit overdone.  Still, nothing dramatic or shocking will be found here, nor the solution of world problems, just life-as-it-once-was for Haven \\"Zippy\\" Kimmel.  A good light read, and for that reason, A Girl Named Zippy is decent entertainment.	2003-02-01

If you feel stumped for ideas on how to design a bedroom, and you have a limited budget, Bedrooms will help release you from that in-the-box mentality that you get from strolling through one too many furniture showrooms that encourage you to buy a complete bedroom set.  Do not be fooled by the \\"(California Design)\\" in the title, this is not a book of California-esque bedroom design, rather, it's a book of interior design for the bedroom by a collection of California designers.  The designs covered range from minimalist, to grand, to traditional, to just plain homey.  Certainly, the numerous color photographs throughout represent people who, in most cases, probably spent a lot of money to have their bedrooms designed as shown, but it is not at all hard to imagine how to apply the same methods to your create own dream bedroom even with things you buy at a flea market.<br />From this book I learned that I could mix and match furniture, not just in the bedroom, but elsewhere, and utilize the eclectic \\"stuff\\" I already own to create a comfortable atmosphere.  You will not find a step-by-step guide in these pages, rather you will find lovely photos and frequently asked questions covered such as: Should a TV be in a bedroom and how? What can one do with a small room? How can I create a romantic bedroom? How can one design a room that will not look dated too soon? What paint colors are best for a bedroom?<br />Aside from the design-ideas aspect of Bedrooms, I just enjoy looking at the photos for relaxation.	2002-12-31

Learning from Hannah is a vehicle by which the author attempts to change our societal view that once you reach a certain age, you no longer have anything to offer, and the author achieves that goal.  It tells the story of two people who learn that the elderly have much to teach us all, if only we will listen.  The main characters also learn that life itself has much more to offer, beyond the next deadline for some distant project.  I applaud Thomas' effort and cause, which is why I give the book 4 stars.<br />From a story standpoint, it felt a bit preachy after a while, and sometimes repetitive; I found myself saying \\"I've got the point already.\\"  In short, I became a little annoyed with the overall story.  The writing seemed a little flat, but it was a good effort.	2002-12-31

This is a very thorough book and it will answer probably any question you'll ever have about African violets.  It covers anything from potting mixture composition to lighting, watering, pests (covered to the extent to give you nightmares), the various methods of propagation, hybridizing, and genetics.  Because it gets into the science of growing African violets, it is probably not for the person who has a passing interest in them.  However, I am one of those who love African violets and am relieved to have a source to go to get all of my questions answered.<br />It's a big book, and reminds me of a textbook in size and weight. It has 314 pages and 29 color photos.	2001-05-09

This is a wonderful book for the young writer, and I wish I'd read it when I was in school.  Ralph Fletcher encourages the reader to observe the world around her, document her observations, and use them as a foundation for future written works.  He has also incorporated the thoughts and poetry of many young writers, his own, as well as those of other established authors.  I think that many adults who've considered writing could also use this book as a starting point.	2001-04-11

Describing over 2,000 fuchsia cultivars and with over 700 close-up color photos of fuchsia flowers, this is a book for those who want to identify and add more plants to their garden.  It covers many of the more commonly found fuchsias as well as many of the more unusual ones to be sought.  The book is perhaps best for the connoisseur of fuchsias, or those who want to be (like me).  About 18 pages cover the history and care of fuchsias and I have found the information helpful.	2001-04-03

The Thyroid Sourcebook answered many of the questions I had when I was first told that I have an underactive thyroid; it was very helpful in guiding me towards a better understanding of what was happening with my body.  With the information presented in the book I was better able to ask the right questions of my doctors, who in turn gave me more informed answers.  I had a better idea of what to expect as I followed the various treatments I was subjected to when it was later determined that I had thyroid cancer.  I only wish that the author covered thyroid cancer a bit more, since it's kind of light on that.  However, this book is not the definitive source on thyroid disorders, and I don't think it was meant to be, rather it is a good guide for the patient and the patient's family.  If you want something that is more definitive, then perhaps a textbook on endocrinology is what you need.	2001-03-30

Zorn's book is a great book and it has really put me on the road to further improvement of my reading rate and comprehension.  He makes no absurd promises, but he tells you from the start that if you practice the methods he presents, you will get results, and that it's all up to you to keep at it.<br />I started at a pitifully slow reading rate of 169 words per minute with 60% comprehension and progressed to 468 wpm with 100% comp. by the end of the book. I found that my results were much better when I worked through complete chapters at a time (and every day), rather than stopping in the middle of a chapter, since the information presented in each chapter serves as a reading warm-up for the tests presented later in the chapter.<br />Throughout the book, Zorn encourages the reader to keep practicing and to not give-up.  I actually bought this book many years ago, and put it down, just certain that it would never help me.  I was wrong, this book has definitely helped and I hope to further improve.<br />Dr. Zorn , wherever you are, thank you!!!	2001-03-22

In The Poisonwood Bible, Barbara Kingsolver demonstrates her ability create a setting and a feeling; in short, she has a true mastery of words.  But The Poisonwood Bible just never pulled me in, and looking at other reviews, I can see that I'm in the minority on that note.  Maybe I missed something.  The story is about a family of missionaries (the parents and their four daughters) who travel to the Congo without a clue about the culture they've gone to live in for a year, and the expectation that it won't differ much from their home in the US.  While there, the jungle and the culture and the politics of the Congo change the family, rather than the family causing the change they'd come to create.<br />The way the story is developed is interesting, written much like a bible.  Every event is told from the viewpoint of each of the five female characters, interesting, but for that reason, I found the book slow moving and slow to get to the point.  It took until about halfway through the book for me to feel any pull to continue to the end, and when I got to the end, it was anticlimactic.	2001-03-07

This is a wonderful collection of classic Italian cooking, and much the way my grandmother used to cook.  It includes recipes for things she used to make but that I hadn't been able to find previously.  There are perhaps a couple of hundred recipes, and all of them are easy to follow.  The instructions don't carry on for pages, which is good, because I don't like recipes that are so lengthy I get overwhelmed. The author, who was raised in Abruzzi, includes insight with every recipe, answering questions about Italian cooking and cooking in general.  For instance, I could never understand how my earlier attempts at making pasta failed, until I read about the difference in egg sizes; now my pasta is great.  The book is interspersed with accounts of her childhood in Italy, adding a more personal feel to it.  Maybe the only drawback for the uninitiated cook is that there are no pictures of the recipes to entice you, but don't let that stop you.	2001-02-15

I was recently given this book and I find that it is a good book to get started in Asian cooking with.  Having cooked some form of Asian food for years now, I like the availability of the smattering of different cuisines it covers, and have found some recipes I had never seen before, like Tapioca and Taro Pudding (my current favorite comfort food).  I am not sure about how true it is to the various Asian cuisines it encompasses, and those who consider themselves self-appointed experts in Asian cuisine might turn their noses up at some of its recipes (the recipe for Potato, Broccoli, and Red Bell Pepper Stir-fry comes to mind), but for those who are new to this realm of cooking it might be a good book to start with.  Many recipes seem to have been developed for those who have little access to a decent Asian market, and that is certainly helpful to the beginner.  Only a few recipes call for ingredients that may be harder to find at a standard non-Asian market, but Ms. Wu offers substitutes.  A bonus is that the book is filled with color photos:  there are big photos of every recipe, helpful (though a bit small) photos of the ingredients, and step-by-step photos of the techniques used for each recipe.  My only disappointment is that Ms. Wu did not indicate the country of origin for most of the recipes, nor the correct name associated with them.  For instance, in looking for a recipe for a basic Vietnamese pho soup, I had to search the soup section page-by-page to find it under the name:  Hanoi Beef and Noodle Soup.  However, once I found the recipe and tried it, I was not disappointed; it was delicious.	2001-01-18

I found this book quite informative and useful in its information about many different aspects of visiting Bali.  The book provides wonderful cultural insights, historical background and detailed information.<br />The only major discrepancy we came across, for instance, was that the book said that Kuta has problems with tourists being hassled by street vendors, but when we went in April, we found that the main street in Kuta (where the Matahari Department Store is) quite the opposite.  It turned out that the officials had just recently come down on the street vendors and put a stop to harassing tourists there.  Instead, when we went to the center of town in Ubud, we were hassled a great deal by taxi/moped drivers to get us to hire them; this caught us off guard.<br />In response to concerns that the book isn't current on it's information, I feel that you shouldn't rely on a guidebook for prices, and that as a whole Lonely Planet Bali &amp; Lombok gives the information that you need to know.  It tells you in great detail about what there is to see and do, and where things are and how things work.  I mean afterall, by the time any book reaches publication, isn't a lot of the information out-of-date?  Otherwise, a book would never get published; it would be a newsletter.<br />I gave this a rating of 4 stars only because when we went to Bali,  we didn't travel enough of the country (and we didn't get to Lombok) to give the book 5 stars.	2000-12-31

Essential Bali &amp; Lombok is a lightweight book, with only 126 pages, and not quite small enough to fit in a pocket (it's about 7 inches long by about 5 inches), and due to it's size we didn't expect a whole lot from it, but we were pleased with it.  The book gives quick, brief descriptions of some of the primary things to see and do.  Certainly with it's the old publication date (1998), we didn't rely on it too much with regard to specific restaurants and hotels.  It was good to have an abbreviated source to refer to, and we used to it to find some of the must-sees, especially those listed in the &quot;10 Essentials&quot; sections.	2000-12-31

This book is a handy source for getting by speaking Bahasa Indonesia, the national language of Indonesia, and will serve you well if you go to Bali.  In Bali, they speak Bahasa Bali and Bahasa Indonesia, and as I have read in Lonely Planet Bali &amp; Lombok guidebook, apparently, Bahasa Indonesia is easier for the visitor to learn.<br />My husband and I used this book on our trip to Bali in April, and found it very useful.  We pleased many Balinese by trying to speak in Bahasa Indonesia, instead of expecting them to speak English.<br />This is a very small book (126 pages, 3.5&quot; x 5&quot;) and fits nicely in the pocket of the very lightweight clothing you will want to wear while in a hot, humid, tropical climate.  The book is organized according to topics (food, taxi, shopping, emergencies etc.), rather than alphabetically like a dictionary, and we found the organization helpful when we really needed it, like when dealing with vendors or when going to a cafe.  The only thing different that I would have liked to be added, is a small dictionary of Bahasa Indonesia at the back of the book to accompany the small English one.  Although we were not at a loss without and Indonesian dictionary.	2000-12-31

I have been regularly venturing into various Asian markets for many years, and although in doing so I have gained some knowledge of the basics of Asian cooking, there is still a vast amount I didn't know until I bought this book.  The Asian Grocery Store Demystified finally answers many of the questions I've had for years, but was hesitant to ask the store owner.  The book is based on the author's frequent visits to a Chinese grocery store, therefore other Asian cultures get a light treatment.  However, by itself Chinese cooking is vast and varied, and it would probably be impossible for any one book to cover the full range of food items to be found, so I give her credit for covering what she did, including various other Asian foods.  There are no photos, and I feel that the more uninitiated cook of Asian cuisine will be at a bit of a loss without them, but the author does a good job of describing much of what you will often find, and the random drawings help.  The book includes descriptions of the basic cooking utensils, cooking techniques, a brief glossary, and a smattering of recipes from different Asian cultures.  I particularly appreciate the author's encouragement of the reader to try food items that the stranger to Asian cuisines might otherwise wrinkle his or her nose to.	2000-12-01

I recently bought Fun &amp; Fancy Sushi after I discovered that I am sensitive to wheat products, much like an allergy.<br />Fun &amp; Fancy Sushi offers easy alternatives to the sushi one usually finds at a sushi bar in a Japanese restaurant.  If the thought of eating raw fish is worrisome, this is the book for you, because with the exception of fish roe, the ingredients are either vegetable, cooked fish or meat.  Many of the sushi recipes offered are balls of rice (the Japanese equivalent to sandwiches) with various flavorings added.  In addition, there are recipes for more elaborate and colorful sushi for parties.<br />Along with the recipes, the authors include tips on how to properly cook in a rice cooker, as well as historical information and regional variations.  The numerous color photos on almost every page are enticing and helpful.<br />My only warning is that this book is probably best for those who have tried to cook Asian food before, since there are a few things left out, like what kind of rice to use.  For instance, Uncle Ben's rice will not do, you'll need to use either the cal-rose rice or jasmine rice for these recipes to work.  Also, if you do not have access to an Asian market, and you lack some creativity, you might be puzzled by some (not all) of the recipes.  I've given it rating of 5 stars because I've looked at a number of similar books, and this one is the best I've seen.   It gives traditional and modern recipes without being too outlandish (one book I saw had a recipe for Nutella sushi).<br />Overall, it's a good cookbook and it will provide you with some healthful alternatives to a grilled cheese sandwich, as well as some fun additions to your party that will amaze your friends.	2000-11-03

Bonsai Miniatures offers a refreshing alternative to the fairly large bonsai that often require two people to move them and an equally large porch or patio on which to grow them.  The miniature bonsai (some as small as two inches in height) depicted in Zeko Nakamura's book open a whole world of possibility to those budding bonsai aficionados who have only a small deck on which to grow plants and who don't want to launch into a major undertaking.<br />Aside from creating miniature bonsai out of the standard bonsai plants such as cypress and Japanese maple, Nakamura suggests looking at other possibilities:  a common houseplant, a garden perennial or even a dandelion.  In this 62-page book, just enough information is provided to successfully create miniature bonsai, yet without overwhelming the reader with a lot of technical detail; the diagrams are equally sufficient.  Finally, the numerous color photos (31 in all) found throughout serve as inspiration	2000-10-18
US	51144305	R2BXVWLM9NAPFF	0804802823	255123578	The Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Highly technical and informative.	This book, beyond a doubt, has all of the information the serious bonsai artist needs to know.  A friend gave me this book when I first expressed an interest in bonsai, and it succeeded in intimidating me.  The authors provide very thorough details about creating bonsai, and take it to the level of science rather than art.  However, it is because of this high degree of detail that I was struck with how serious the art really can be.  I find it unfortunate that it is currently out of print, since it does cover bonsai in such detail.  I would tend to recommend Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes to the person who is quite dedicated to pursuing the art, and would not recommend it to a person with a more casual interest.	2000-10-18

Having been to SF a few times before (some years ago), I purchased this guide as my only guide for the city.  I didn't want to carry a big heavy book on my weekend trip and, more often than not, I found myself without the information I needed.  The typical questions any visitor might have go unanswered and the information is spotty.  For instance, the author gives a list of the primary local radio stations, including the radio dial numbers for them, but fails to tell the reader what some of the primary city bus routes are that run in and out of the center of downtown.  And yet, looking at the maps throughout the book, you'll see route numbers on many of the streets depicted, but these refer to bicycle routes, not buses.  Really, how many tourists are even going to think about riding a bicycle through probably the hilliest city in the world?  The most obvious thing that is lacking is any information about the one thing that any visitor wants to know about:  the cable cars (there is mention of the oldstyle electric buses or trolleys).  Look in the index under &quot;cable cars&quot;, and you won't find it.  The basics about the cable car system are missing:  what the cable car routes are, where does one get on the cable car (I knew that you can get on one at any stop if it's not full - good luck),  and how to pay for the cable car ride (the operater collects the fare or looks at your day pass just before the car leaves the stop).<br />The restaurant reviews are handy, but again, uneven.  My companions were eager to go to Fisherman's Wharf (one place I knew to be such a tourist trap that it was best left unvisited) and have dinner.  Once we were there, we found the guide lacking in any mention of the most obvious places to eat in the heart of the Wharf.  The author mentions one restaurant, Alioto's, but discounts the rest as simply not worth going to.  So we went to Fisherman's Grotto, which I was apprehensive about, but it wasn't bad, certainly not haute cuisine.  We were all pleased with what we ordered.  I tried the sand dabs, a type of small flat fish caught in the Bay, which were nicely prepared and very delicate: lightly floured and fried in a little butter.<br />On the plus side:  the maps are very handy, and easy to read.  I did like the way the book was sectioned-off into the different districts.<br />Overall, the book is best suited as a supplement to a more thorough guidebook, but not the primary source for your trip.  I just can't see how anyone can write a guide book to any city and fail to give information about key places that most tourists will want to know about.	2000-09-23

It was so thoroughly researched, I couldn't believe it was fiction. It's definitely not your typical mass market novel, but written much like a novel by Charles Dickens. This is a book of  quality, don't expect lurid details of sexual encounters, rather it's the  journey of a girl into her adulthood. As a woman, I couldn't believe  Memoirs was written by a man.	1999-09-03

It started out kinda quirky and entertaining, but then about one third of the way through, it began to fall apart. As I read on, the plot became less cohesive and it continued to unravel like a poorly knit sweater. The  romance part was dragged-out for a ludicrous amount of time ending with a  silly conclusion. About halfway through, I began to beg for the end. It's  good for a light read, but overall I thought it was insipid.	1999-01-19

I used this book (an older edition) on my first trip to New York City and I found it very succinct and helpful. If you don't want lengthy descriptions and lots of historical background, this the book for you. It  gets to the point about some of the &quot;must sees&quot; and  &quot;shouldn't miss&quot;, as well as warning you about some cultural  differences. The Essential series is also great because it's thin and  lightweight, yet some color pictures so that you can recognize some of the  sites you're searching the skyline for.	1998-11-17

Of all the houseplant books I've seen, this is the one book that covers almost any houseplant available, including some I've never seen. Within its 318 pages you'll find the plant descriptions are sufficient, but not overwhelming, the care instructions clear, and the photos and drawings (mostly drawings) very helpful. Recently, I was able to locate an old hardcover copy to replace my deteriorating paperback copy.	1998-04-30
