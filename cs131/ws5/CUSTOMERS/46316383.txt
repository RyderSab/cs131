I enjoyed making them with half of the kids in my family, and attacking the other half with my bepuppeted hand, just like the late (and apparently huge) Rod Hull did with Emu on Parky that time.  Really funny.  Though the wife sent me to bed without any supper.	2003-07-07

This book is an enormous help and reference to me whenever I have to do the family's teeth (I find it saves money - my wife does the haircuts), though there are some issues around acute temporomandibular disorders and chronic pain management that I do not feel are fully addressed.

Yalkowsky has written a gem here: quite possibly the best book on solubility in aqueous media I have read, and right up with the best on solubilization in the same. One of the interesting conundrums posed is: why do people float on the dead sea?

I tend not to build that many SANs these days, and restrict myself to maybe 30 a week or fewer, but I still find that this is enough to make me want not to think about them outside of this.

Electronic spurs come in for a lengthy discussion here, no less so spring-loaded saddles for when Dobbin plays rough.  10 gallon hats are converted to metric, in keeping with much recent progress on that side of things.  The book could have done with a better discussion of auto-lassos, which have developed a long way since their introduction a few years ago.  Cowboy builders (of whom there are many in my neck of the woods) will be pretty disappointed, though.  All in all, an excellent read.	2003-04-01

At the very least, it should suggest how to do &quot;turn on&quot; people in the sense of backstabbing - I mean, I am quite prepared to turn on my staff when cornered by senior management about why I haven't done something I said I would. (Needless to say, there are a few people reading these reviews who will know who I'm talking about.)  But no.  It means &quot;to switch on&quot; or &quot;engage&quot;.

Some of them are splendid, but some of them slightly cliched or bizarre. I, for one, would be happy never to go to Stoke-on-Trent again, especially since the scampi in the pub was off, no matter what the waiter said.  The Barnes wetlands centre is, admittedly, a decent visit for the family, though not necessarily a \\"must-see\\".  On balance, pretty good.	2003-03-26

Even for laser guns (non-conventional firearms, I prefer to call them), issues such as trajectory, wind-factor and motion are germane.  This book is, indeed, ballistics.	2003-03-26

But what he does do is take the FAQs that many experts might have in relation to boilers and answer them in a way that is comprehensive and - for the expert, at least - probably quite helpful.  <br />My own interest was in getting a slim little 85000 BTU combi with a 2 stage frost thermostat to protect against frost whilst minimising gas consumption, as well as a built-in expansion vessel for sealed system operation and an automatic bypass valve.  My question?  Simply, where to get one.  To be fair, PC wasn't so good on this type of question, dwelling more on the mechanical elements of energy efficiency and so on.  But for folk like me, there are always the search engines.  <br />(For the record, I think an inch is about a metre and a half.)	2003-03-26

Suffice to say, come Christmas Day, Jeffrey was in tears and the whole household was looking at me reproachfully.  <br />But when I locked myself in the lavatory for the rest of the afternoon to escape the sarcastic commentary from the assembled throng, I was absolutely rapt with it.

I was hoping that it would be a comedy slant on the trauma my mistress and I experienced following her botched surgical enhancement (a word to the wise: only go to reputable surgeons who use real silicon - plasticine is never likely to work).  Whilst it wasn't that, it did divert me from the constant earache she was giving me over the matter, and ultimately gave me the chance I needed to suggest that we should go our separate ways.	2003-03-25

I wanted to correct my grammar which weren't very good but Derrida did not help me he was talking difficult stuff.  <br />While my grammar was attacked however, Miss Rogers did concede my principal point, which was that Derrida, having constructed his own metanarrative, is as susceptible to wilful misinterpretation through the prism of other metanarratives as he inflicts on others.  Moreover, in some of Derrida's earlier essays, he specifically attacks Heidegger for misunderstanding what he means when accounting for his own form of deconstruction.  Yet it seems to me - and surely to most? - that the central tenet of deconstruction is this: that authorial intent cannot be guaranteed as ultimate meaning; and that ultimate meaning does not exist.  Vive la differance?  Or does he need a kick up the arche?<br />Miss Rogers gave me a B- for anyone interested.	2003-03-25

I bought this book recently, having had my interest piqued by dipping into the Harry Potter series that my youngest son Derek so admires.  I can certainly understand the appeal of playing Quidditch (though the rules remain as impenetrable to me as American Football - sorry US friends!) and of flying and so on.  However, Israel Regardie et al seem to be so into the arcane &quot;Ceremonial Magick&quot; esoterica that they miss the things that the common man like me would welcome - to wit, most of the tricks in the film &quot;Matilda&quot; and showing off at dinner parties.

I confess that I purchased this book in error, thinking it was something to do with the Norwegian tobacco industry (a market that I had assumed was untapped, and at that time my &quot;next big thing&quot;).  It's not hard to see, though, that our mistakes can be every bit as rewarding as our intentions.<br />Such was the case with this little book. Edwards's magnum opus compares favourably with its rivals that focus too much on the salmon end of things, without ever addressing the needs of the trout farmer (of whom I know many).  In particular, food and allocation of space (more realistically, water) are addressed, and so, too, is the correct spelling of the words &quot;fjord&quot; and &quot;gravadlax&quot;.	2003-03-24
