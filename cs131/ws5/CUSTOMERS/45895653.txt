Believe me when I say Borrowed Light is a must-read.<br /><br />The protagonist is a teenager named Callisto who finds herself more or less caring for her little brother. She is a smart girl who is growing up more quickly than she should. Unbeknownst to her family, Callisto is pregnant and plans on having an abortion.<br /><br />The title is so fitting for this book, coming from a great passage in which Callisto relates family members to celestial bodies. She is named after a moon, and, like that moon, feels that she borrows light from others, from family members who are suns and stars, who far outshine her.<br /><br />Borrowed Light will inspire thoughtful discussions in book groups or classrooms. What some may consider a \\"touchy subject\\" is handled with feeling and deliacy, with no judgment passed. Shine on, Callisto.	2005-08-22

As Rachel learns more about her charge Grace, she also learns more about herself.<br /><br />Finding Grace is an aptly titled coming-of-age story that I recommend to teens and adults alike. It was surprisingly poignant. Rachel is appropriately awkward at first, not certain how to act around Grace. She is also on that brink between being a kid and being an adult, having graduated from high school but not completely knowing what she wants to do next.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed Alyssa Brugman's debut, Walking Naked, I feel that Finding Grace was an even better story. My heart went out to each of the characters in turn, and the writing kept me wanting to find out more about all of them. I'm sure to read Brugman's future works as well.	2005-08-22

This story employs the \\"new person moves to town\\" plot - but it's far more complex than that.<br /><br />Anna, a high school student, is more than what she seems. She likes to write obituaries for people who are still alive - for every person in town, even though she's just moved there with her parents. She wears black clothes, black boots, dark makeup, offsetting her blond hair. She loves Lovecraft, making mix CDs, and discussing the codes Houdini and his wife shared. She can argue both sides of a debate with equal passion and knowledge, thus making it unclear which side she herself would support. She insists that people call her Anastasia.<br /><br />The narrator calls her Anna. He's a high school student as well. His name is unknown; it is unimportant. What is important is their relationship. He finds himself intrigued with Anna, despite her status as a \\"Goth,\\" and the two begin dating. Her ideas challenge him; her intelligence impresses him; and, seven months later, her disappearance baffles him.<br /><br />Author Gregory Galloway has created a stunning and haunting tale. Just as Anna herself, this book is hard to categorize. Many would call \\"As Simple as Snow\\" a mystery, but just as many might refer to it as a coming-of-age story. The writing is engrossing, placing the reader on the same page (no pun intended) as the narrator, trying to figure out Anna herself as well the codes she used. Readers will be looking for clues in the grand design while  falling for this strong, willful character and wondering why she left.<br /><br />It even has an appropriately creepy website, where you may download the mix CDs Anna created and watch a unique trailer for the book. If the trailer doesn't make you want to read the book immediately, I don't know what will.<br /><br />This isn't a run-of-the-mill mystery, nor a cautionary tale. It's a story about a boy, a girl, a town, a code. It's a story about that time in your life when you realize nothing is as simple as it seems. Once you realize that, you can't go back, no matter how hard you try. You can only go forward.nary tale. It's a story about a boy, a girl, a town, a code.

They were close and carefree as they traveled across the USA, living somewhere for a little while, until the itch to move had to be scratched again. Savannah does not know who her father is, but that's okay with her. Their family  of two suits her just fine.<br /><br />During Savannah's childhood, Alice went through a string of boyfriends. However, as Savannah is about to cross over into double digits, Alice falls for Jack. They get married, have a little boy, and plan roots. Suddenly, the family has doubled in size. The road trips end - and the abuse begins. Jack likes to drink. He does not seem to like Savannah.<br /><br />By the time Savannah is in high school, her stepfather has lost his job, her mother has lost the spark she once had, and her half-brother Henry has learned to listen in doorways before coming in the room, for fear of walking in on an argument. One night in the kitchen, it becomes too much for Savannah. She hits Jack with a pan (not to kill him but to knock him out), tells Henry to pack some things, takes the car keys and leaves with her little brother in tow.<br /><br />Stealing Henry is more than what the title implies. It is about family and about survival. The story impressively alternates between present day, following Savannah's attempt at escape, and 1986, when Savannah's mother was a teenager. The modern part of the story takes place over a matter of days, keeping up with the swift pace of Savannah and Henry as they go across the country.<br /><br />The characters and the stories they tell are memorable. The dialogue is realistic, especially that spoken by Savannah, who doesn't hold back. She is remarkably selfless. Her love for her brother and her mother shines in everything she does. When Savannah realizes that her mother is not who she once was, the revelation alone is heartbreaking, but the writing makes it even moreso.<br /><br />I highly recommend Stealing Henry, especially to those who love books by Sarah Dessen and Melissa Lion. Those who enjoyed Falling Through Darkness, Carolyn MacCullough's first novel, will not be disappointed by Stealing Henry. In fact, they may enjoy Stealing Henry even more. I know I did.s heartbreaking, but the writing makes it even moreso. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Stealing Henry, especially to those who love books by Sarah Dessen and Melissa Lion.

By the time she was a teenager, everything had fallen apart. Her father died. Her mother turned to alcohol. Her brother was sent away to live with relatives, but Zoe had to stay, for the sake of her mother - and her overbearing grandmother.<br /><br />Zoe finds a small house on Lorelai Street with a room to rent. It is owned by a kind elderly woman, and the rent is cheap, something she can afford on her salary as an afterschool waitress. She is at first hesitant to move out of her home, but when her mother does one more thing - the straw that broke the camel's back - Zoe gets out of there.<br /><br />What makes protagonist Zoe remarkable is that she does not lament her childhood nor blame others. She never whines about her situation. She never drowns in self-pity. She is a likable, fallible character.<br /><br />Set in modern-day and written in present tense, A Room on Lorelai Street is something which can be read cover-to-cover in one sitting. Not only that, but this book should appeal to teenagers and adults alike, reading it with different perspectives.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever struggled to make ends meet, no matter what his or her age or situation, will appreciate the numbers Zoe has to crunch, the sacrifices she has to make, and the consequences she must face. Congratulations to Mary Pearson on creating a character with heart and writing a book that will stick with readers years after they have finished it.	2005-07-23

While at her best friend's wedding, thirty-two year old Flora wishes to be sixteen again. Her wish is granted, but with a unique twist: she does not go back in time sixteen years and relive her teenagedom in the 80s, but rather in the present day.<br /><br />The writing was quite lively and made me laugh out loud many times. Pop culture references run rampant throughout the book. Flora is silly, serious, selfish and selfless in turns, realizing that she never really grew up, but that adulthood does have its good points.<br /><br />If you enjoy books or films that employ the \\"be careful what you wish for\\" / \\"wanting to be young again\\" plotline, and if you enjoy comedies, definitely check out this book. It's worth the read.	2005-07-20

After breaking up with her boyfriend, she thinks she'll have a quiet moment to herself, sitting near the frozen-over lake late at night. She sees a slightly older couple, who urge her to come with them to be safe. She stays put. They warn her about the thin ice and depart. Shortly thereafter, a couple about her age drives by on an ATV, loud and giddy, teasing her. Lonely and cranky, she doesn't pass on the warning about the ice.<br /><br />The next morning, she hears about their deaths on the news. She realizes she was the last person to see them alive - and that she might have been able to prevent their deaths. But she doesn't tell anyone that she was there, not even her mother, not even her two best friends.<br /><br />And things start to change.<br /><br />Soon, Hanna meets Will, someone else tied in with that night's events.  She gets involved with him rather quickly. Just as quickly, she finds herself drawn into a family with hearts on their sleeves and skeletons in their closet.<br /><br />Just Like That is highly realistic dramatic fiction in the vein of Sarah Dessen - and that is a high compliment coming from me.  It is a must-read book for anyone looking for a poignant story with true-to-life, flawed characters. When I make my top books of the year selections in December, Just Like That is sure to be high on the list.	2005-06-16

After taking a family trip to Boston and seeing the Declaration of Independence, Judy decides to write her own Declaration. She also makes a new friend in Tori, a bunny-loving British girl who collects sugar packets and becomes her pen pal. With a little help from her friends and her brother, Judy even stages her own Boston Tea Party! Along the way, Judy learns about history as well as responsibility.<br /><br />Judy continues to say \\"Rare!\\" when things are swell and \\"Roar!\\" when things are not-so-good. She also starts to use the happy exclamation, \\"Star-spangled bananas!\\"<br /><br />Megan McDonald has written another funny story for kids and adults to enjoy. As with the other Judy books, McDonald accurately captures the emotions and imagination of a grammar school girl. The reading level of Independence is right along the same lines as the previous Judy Moody tales: perfect for elementary school kids reading on their own, or for families to read aloud and share. The book also offers unique and cute illustrations by the talented Peter Reynolds.<br /><br />If you like the silliness of Ramona Quimby or the adventures of Katie Kazoo, you'll definitely like the antics of Judy Moody.	2005-05-24

Hailing from New York, Hava is a high school student that is both an Orthodox Jew and, in her own words, a little punk rock. She also happens to be an actress, though not completely by choice.<br /><br />Though the first chapter starts on the last day of school, the second chapter gives the reader some background: After being randomly discovered outside of a store, she's cast in an Off-Broadway play. Not thinking much of herself as an actress, she easily returns to her normal routine of friends, family and school after the play ends.<br /><br />On the last day of the school year, she is called into the principal's office. She thinks she is going to be scolded for acting out earlier that day. Instead, she is shocked by huge news: a new television comedy about a family wants her to play the older sister - and she starts on Monday. Immediately, her summer plans are out the window. She relocates to Los Angeles and has a total culture shock. The West Coast world is very different from her hometown, where everyone knew everyone. Hava discovers that living on her own isn't all that it is cracked up to be, and neither is the entertainment industry.<br /><br />Never Mind the Goldbergs is far meatier than it first appears. Hava is a fabulous protagonist. Her attempts to find a balance between her religion and her work feel real, with her actions never making her a saint, but never making her into a bad girl either. She tries to make good choices for herself. She never does something just to stand out and get attention, nor does she try to fit in and conform. She simply is who she is. She is a flawed, realistic character, and that's what makes it work. I definitely recommend this book.	2005-03-24

For two years, Michael attempted to protect his mother and repeatedly tried to get her to leave his stepfather. She refused to leave, even as her husband's temper flared and their home situation worsened. Finally, Michael ran away to work at a traveling carnival; shortly thereafter, his stepfather was dead and his mother was imprisoned.<br /><br />A year after he left, Michael comes back to Florida with the carnival and finds out that the jury selection is beginning for his mother's trial. She has confessed to the murder, and her attorney is discussing battered spouse syndrome. Michael must decide whether or not to speak up in his mother's defense and tell the truth about what happened in his stepfather's home.<br /><br />Michael's downward spiral is explained well without ever being heavy-handed. He had decent grades, football, friends and a social life, but as the abuse at home increased, he quit football so that he would have more time at home to look after his mom. After losing his jock friends, he reluctantly starts hanging out with a kid who is now known as a bit of a geek - but used to be his best friend in middle school. When Michael meets Kirstie, a dark-haired beauty a few years his senior, at the carnival, he discovers that he can have his own life - but at what expense?  When he returns to Miami a year later, he again must weigh his choices and decide what and who are the most important things in life.<br /><br />Nothing to Lose is a well-written book that deftly weaves in the protagonist's past and present, with each chapter simply labelled \\"Last Year\\" or \\"This Year.\\" It moves along at a steady pace, never breaking form nor dragging its feet. It is a compelling story that will keep the reader on edge until the very end.<br /><br />Alex Flinn has written three books thus far, the other two being Breaking Point, about peer pressure and popularity, and Breathing Underwater, about teenage dating and abuse. Though I liked all three of Flinn's books, I think her writing has greatly improved with the passage of time. Her first novel, Breathing Underwater, gets two and a half stars from me; Breaking Point snags three stars; and Nothing to Lose deserves four stars.

She has only one memory of her father: meeting him in an airport, where he gave her gingerbread and bough her a doll. She promptly named the doll Gingerbread and has carried it around ever since.<br /><br />Now a teenager, she still has the doll, as well as the yearning to see her father. Her mother has remarried, and though she gets along well enough with her stepfather and adores her younger half-siblings, she feels out of place - and feels the need to get out of that place.<br /><br />She finally gets the chance to visit her father, going across the continent to the other coast, only to find that she doesn't quite fit there either. Her father is distant and their relationship is awkward. She has half-siblings on her father's side, but they are older, grown, which pushes her into the unfamiliar role of the younger sister. Luckily, she hits it off with one of them: her half-brother Danny, who is extremely lovable and easily my favorite character in the book.<br /><br />The book moves along at a good pace, giving you more and more insight into the characters as it goes along. Secrets are revealed, bonds are made, promises are broken, but always in a realistic fashion. In other words, this book is not sappy nor melodramatic. It reminds us that just because you are related does not make you automatic friends, but it does not have to make you enemies either.<br /><br />I am looking forward to Shrimp, the sequel to Gingerbread, released in 2005. I also greatly enjoyed Rachel Cohn's juvenile novel The Steps, which also dealt with extended and estranged families, but with a younger protagonist and a touch more comedy.	2005-01-18

A serial killer whose targets young boys mistakeningly nabs a little girl and it throws his entire routine out of whack. The story takes place in New York in December 1996, beginning two days before Christmas, when the girl is first taken.<br /><br />The narrative, written in third person, shows us how each main character reacts to the situation. Emily Rose, the victim, is a very astute nine-year-old who has every intention of staying alive and running away. Her mother, Laurie, is worried sick at home and finds herself reliving her own past. George, aka The Chocolate Man, the serial killer, is obsessed with the number seven, repetition and cleaning. The detectives on the special Task Force that has been trying to locate The Chocolate Man for years are determined to find this man and child. Readers are also privvy to the thoughts and lives of various witnesses, neighbors, friends and strangers whose lives are somehow connected to those involved in the case. My favorite character is Emily Rose, who is aware of her surroundings and her situation. Her love for her mother, her vivid imagination and her passion for Nancy Drew mysteries help to keep her strong.<br /><br />It is written in a very direct style. Since you know from the start - from the book jacket itself - the identities of the kidnapper and of the victim, the story is more about the psychological impact on the murderer, on the child, on her mother.  The bulk of the story takes place in 24 hours - a day in the life of many.<br /><br />If you enjoy novels about missing persons and prefer characters with heart rather than characters ripping out people's hearts, give this book a try.	2005-01-10

The plot revolves around a family whose youngest daughter, Anna, was created to be a genetic donor for their other daughter, Kate. Now 13 years old, Anna is bringing her parents to court - for the right to be medically emancipated, so that she can make her own decisions about what she does or does not have to donate - just as Kate desperately needs Anna's kidney.<br /><br />Kate was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia when she was only 2 years old. Back then, the eldest child, Jesse, was 4. Now, Jesse is a rebellious teenager; Kate is 16 and in relapse; and Anna feels both taken for granted and invisible. The father, Brian, is a firefighter with an interest in astronomy; the mother, Sara, is a former lawyer who stopped practicing when she had children. Other main characters include Campbell Alexander, the lawyer Anna sought out to try her case, and a court-appointed guardian named Julia.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between characters, always told in first-person. The only main character who doesn't speak in first-person chapters is the one at the heart of it all - Kate. Other characters of importance include Campbell's service dog, Judge, though Campbell refuses to say why he needs him; Julia's twin sister, Isobel aka Izzy; and Sara's older sister, Zanne.<br /><br />It is an absolutely beautiful story. At first, I thought that being told from all of these points of view would hurt the narrative; soon, I realized, it helped it, as Picoult is able to establish a different 'voice' for each of the characters. The bulk of the novel takes place over the course of two weeks. Flashbacks are interwoven seamlessly, mostly through Sara's eyes, but also through dialogue as people discuss the past, glimpse photographs or reveal truths about themselves . . . and others.<br /><br />Read it.

After the death of their mother, two sisters become closer, with the younger sister looking up to her older sister more than words can express. Their father, though he loves his daughters, becomes more distant as he grieves for his wife, removes her pictures from the house walls, and throws himself into his thriving business.<br /><br />Fast-forward years later: The younger sister, Delia, is in middle school. She's a good girl, but doesn't have any notable hobbies - except for dancing. Suddenly, the local mainstream dance school with its yearly corny recitals are not satisfying enough for her, and she decides to pursue ballet exclusively. She enrolls at a prestigious school taught by a Madame who strictly adheres to the classic type of ballet instruction. As Delia's love for ballet deepens, she starts having her own life - and her own secrets.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Delia's older sister is getting kicked out of school after school due to her behavior. She is not a felon nor a threat to anyone, simply a free spirit who does not want to conform. She dresses in dark clothes that she reshapes and redesigns. She dyes her blonde hair black. She truly cares for her little sister, and still loves her father, but she too has distanced herself from her family, feeling as if she is the only one who truly remembers her mother. Sent off to a new school, she expects nothing, but surprises herself and everyone else when she ends up with a new interest - taming a horse that was said to be untameable.<br /><br />I recommend this book to a wide audience. This book is not just about ballet, nor solely about parents and children grieving over a loss, but rather about honoring those memories while making new ones. Each character finds something he or she is passionate about. The dynamic between the characters is realistic and the plot is interesting and familiar without being clich&eacute;.

The girl is Skye, whose reputation has been sullied over the years in high school; the boy is Matt, who thinks he is invisible to everyone but  Katy, his likeable, quirky younger sister. They attend the same high school but never speak - until she starts seeking him out.<br /><br />When Skye begins leaving notes for Matt to meet her privately, he can't resist. When she demands that their relationship stay a secret, he can't protest. When her requests turn sinister, he can't pull away.<br /><br />This short but sweet book is a page-turner.

He profiles not just the students but some of the teachers and parents as well as the principal. There are the popular kids; the audio/visual boys; the jocks, both female and male; the Homecoming Queen; the teen parents; all sharing their experiences.<br />The title is two-fold. The book begins with a passage by Lewis Carroll, whose classic work Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a coming-of-age tale in its own right. One of the boys profiled in this work attempts to get John Mayer, the singer / songwriter / guitarist, to perform at their school prom. Mayer has a song entitled \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" It is interesting to note that the student body had an interest in Mayer prior to his winning Grammy awards; in fact, the book shows his rise to fame over the course of the school year, as well as the band Maroon 5.<br />Happily, the focus of the book is not on songwriters or pop culture, but the experiences of teens. They offer drama, comedy and tragedy. Such is real life.<br />Wonderland is a very quick read and worth picking up. Never invasive, never an expose, this book tells it how it is. The writer never judges the actions of the teens; he lets their actions speak for themselves. Each chapter is named after a month, September through May. I would have liked to have read more about finals and graduation, rather than cutting off after the prom in May. However, I liked the last bit wrapping up what happened the summer and fall after the school year, and the fact that the author tied it into his own past and present experiences.<br />This study of a year in the life of high school students to shows that, when you get down to it, teenagers across the nation have more in common than they might think.

Since then, they have branched out, creating fiction and non-fiction books for kids of all ages.<br />The Mix-It-Up Cookbook introduces children to various basic recipes, such as pancakes, milkshakes, burritos, pizzas and macaroni. The colorful illustrations and straightforward instructions are both eye-catching and informative. The recipes are simple and the meals are healthy, not to mention yummy. Each recipe offers various ways to \\"mix it up.\\" For example, prepare some scrambled eggs, add them to a warm flour tortilla and voila - you have a breakfast burrito all ready to go.<br /><br />The book is also spiral-bound, meaning that it will lay flat on the countertop while you cook. This leaves both hands available to cut, mix and stir.  Rather than trying to balance ingredients, bowls and utensils in one hand while propping the book open with the other hand, show kids that both hands should be available to cook. That will further reinforce kitchen safety.<br /><br />From tossing a simple salad to setting the table, there are many ways to include all family members in mealtime. Get your kids in the kitchen and teach them how to be safe, how to follow instructions, and how to cook. Encourage them to make up their own fun dishes (within reason, of course) and you may soon turn your reluctant helper into a willing kitchen aide. Who knows -- you might have a future chef on your hands and not know it.<br /><br />Now, if you are feeling really adventurous, have your munchkins help you prepare next week's grocery list!	2004-05-19

Even better is the fact that it actually fits the book. Here, we find main character Anna attempting to write a screenplay for class based on THE GREAT GATSBY. The concept of \\"old money versus new money\\" as read in the classic story applies to Anna's new world, filled with L.A. teenage socialities whose cliques clash based on who your parents are and how much money they make.<br /><br />The majority of the first novel of THE A-LIST series took place in a mere 24 hours. GIRLS ON FILM plays out more like a normal book or show, following characters over the course of a few weeks.  Now that Anna is attending high school, settling into her father's house, making new friends and breaking new hearts, it is a more familiar scene than the quick-boom-bang wedding-party-holiday that was the debut. It is also a little less racy and a little more character driven than the first book. Fans of teen dramas on THE WB or the book series GOSSIP GIRL will enjoy this book and look forward to the next one.	2004-05-13

THE A-LIST follows a day in the life of New York teenager Anna, who visits her father for New Year's Eve. In the course of 24 hours, Anna's world is turned upside down. She finds herself kissing a college guy on a plane, falling for him, meeting girls her own age (and in her own money bracket) who are chic-er-than-thou, getting involved in a love quadrangle, attending a wedding, buying naughty clothes, boarding a boat, and more.<br /><br />In other words, it is like a Friday on a soap opera. If you enjoy the GOSSIP GIRL series or Dawson's Creek, you'll like THE A-LIST.  Quick read, guilty pleasure.	2004-05-13

These girls are wise (and rich) beyond their twelve years, valuing their designer clothes, sparkling homes, and precious cell phones above all else. At the top of the clique is Massie, a girl whose room is modeled after an all-white posh hotel suite.<br /><br />When her father's longtime friend has a stroke of bad luck, Massie's dad lets his friend, his friend's wife and his daughter stay in the guesthouse. This girl may be Massie's peer and new classmate, but, since she is clad in overalls and Keds, Massie is reluctant to make friends.<br /><br />What follows is a somewhat predictable but squeaky clean story, appropriate for middle grades to read. Think a G-rated version of Gossip Girl: money talks, clothes matter, but friendship and backstabbing are the main issues instead of dating and, ahem, other more adult things. In other words, if you like the movie Mean Girls, you'll like this book.	2004-05-13

Its followup, YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME, continues the trend, with the trendy New York high school characters making things more complicated and more sordid every step of the way.<br />At the core of the story is Blair, whose mother is getting married to man Blair cannot stand. Not only that, but he's bringing along his reggae-wannabe son, who is nearly Blair's age but not exactly in her social class. Blair's former best friend, Serena, is every photographer's dream - and every boy's dream as well. Blair's boyfriend is cheating on her with a freshman girl. Throughout it all, Blair wishes she was Audrey Hepburn and tries to get into college.<br />The buzz for this book series continues to grow, and so do the secondary characters. Thankfully, they get a little more fleshed out in this story. The mystery surrounding the identity of Gossip Girl, the chic chick online who always has inside information on the group, continues. She knows who's hot and who's not - and this book is certainly hot among teen readers.	2004-05-06

We, as readers, never see Ethan alive, and yet we do. He lives on in his wife's memories, her heart and her vivid dreams. Sophie thinks she is coping just fine - until she shows up to work in her pajamas and bunny slippers, causing her to lose her job (albeit it a cordial leave of absence rather than being abruptly fired).<br />This, then, is the jumping point of the novel. This is the catalyst for Sophie, making her get out of bed, get out of town and get on with her life. Such things seem impossible, even overwhelming at first, and she holds fast to Ethan's ring and striped ski sweater. She learns that others need her as much as she needs them. She gets closer to her best friend, both figuratively and literally, as she moves to Oregon. Sophie thinks signing up for the Big Brother/Big Sister program will get her a cute little girl to babysit; she instead gets a smart-mouthed smoker teenager named Crystal, whose tough exterior is slowly worn down by Sophie's gentle reassurances. Sophie may even learn how to get along with her mother-in-law -- and start dating again.<br />All the while, Sophie never, ever forgets the love she had for Ethan. The book is sweet, but never false. It kept my attention from start to finish. The realistic characters won my heart with their quirks, strengths and weaknesses. GOOD GRIEF is a fabulous testament to life, love and loss which can be appreciated by a wide range of adults.	2004-05-06

For example, Nate attends rehab and manages to go from addict to hero. This is not the same Nate we met in book one. Blair is as love-hungry as ever, falling for an older man, while her best friend Serena dazzles every boy and man in her path. Artsy outsiders Vanessa and Dan continue their pursuits in film and poetry, respectfully, while pining for each other.<br /><br />As with the previous books in the series, BECAUSE I'M WORTH IT teeters between being coy to being outright racy.

Set in the 1970s, the breakdown of a mother and the subsequent changes within a nuclear family are related to the reader in young Abby's unique voice. Her thoughts are what keep the book flowing so easily, using slang of the time period as well as the vocabulary and ideas of a young woman struggling to understand what is going on in her house.

The pictures are bright and eye-catching. The story is well-paced and well-done. It explains adoption to young children in a simple and loving way.<br />(Be forewarned, because this review is going to give away exactly who adopts Twitchy.)<br />Twitchy is a cute baby rabbit whose parents tell him that he is adopted. Prior to this revelation, he thought nothing of his mother being a cow and his father being a horse. The parents explain how his \\"bunnymom and bunnypop\\" had many children (sixteen, to be exact) so they (the cow and horse) took him in and raised him in a house full of love.<br />Initially, Twitchy does not believe them. When he looks at his parents' reflections in the water alongside his own, he sees the similarities - like their big brown eyes - and not their differences. Confused, Twitchy runs away. The parents search high and low for the little rabbit.<br />Finally, they hear something making soft \\"moo\\" and \\"neigh\\" sounds. They discover their son in an unusual state. Twitchy has attempted to look more like his farmyard parents by putting mud on his white fur to make it white, using clothespins on his floppy ears to make them small and folded, and attaching a twig to his tail.<br />The adults clean Twitchy up and tell him that they love him just as he is.  They emphasize that they ARE his parents, no matter what. Twitchy is content once more and they prepare to have their typical dinner, something all three of them enjoy: carrots!<br />If you are a parent or a schoolteacher, pick this up.  It is a wonderful way to introduce kids to the concept of adoption. It reinforces the fact that love makes you a family.

Millicent is eleven years old - and recently completed eleventh grade. Over the summer, she plans to take college courses and (unhappily) tutor Stanford, a boy who drives her up a wall. Her mother, thinking she needs more of a social life with kids her own age, enrolls her in a summer volleyball team. There, she meets a girl who recently moved to town and does not know of Millicent's collegiate status. What's a smart girl to do?<br />This hilarious book teaches young kids and adults like everywhere that it is okay to be smart. Millicent may feel much older than she is, mentally, but chronologically, she is still a kid.  By the end of the summer, she is a little more comfortable in her own skin and proud of who she is and what she's accomplished.<br />Pop culture tidbit: The audio book is read by Keiko Agena, known as Lane on Gilmore Girls.<br />I highly recommend this book to kids of all ages. (You too, parents and teachers.)  Kids reading comedic realistic fiction such as the Ramona Quimby series by Beverly Cleary, the Alice McKinley series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor or the Judy Moody series by Megan McDonald will certainly adore Millicent Min. I hope that Yee writes more tales, if not of Millicent, then of others. She has a real knack.	2003-10-06

It is a psychological thriller, but it is also a coming of age story. It is the story of a sleepy suburban town, but it is also the story of a young girl named Penny. Most of all, THE CREEK shows that not everything is strictly black or white. Instead, there are shades of gray. Even the most well-meaning person can do something horrific. Sometimes, the loss of innocence is horrifying in itself.<br /><br />Penny and her family moved to a new town a few years ago. Her father, a doctor, and her mother, young and well-liked by her kids and neighbors, are really good parents. Her brothers are younger than she is, Teddy being only a few years her junior and Sam being a baby.  Before they moved there, a kid named Caleb terrorized the town. He was rumored to have killed animals as well as other kids and rigged accidents in which people were severely if not mortally wounded. He was sent away for years.<br />The story starts with Penny and her friends on a summer afternoon. Everything seems well and normal. That is, until Penny spots Caleb, who has returned to town.<br /><br />As various pets go missing, the tension rises and the accusations begin to fly.  In spite of their parents' instance that they not go into the woods and not go to the creek, Penny, Teddy and their friends continue to hang out in their fort. The neighborhood's traditional softball games and block parties which used to be so safe and happy become shattered by tragedies. The routines that they used to have are now plagued by loss and fear.<br /><br />What is wrong? What is right? WHO is right? Penny struggles with these moral questions while simply trying to stay a kid and the only girl in a group of boys. She fights the changes that are happening to her, to her friends, and to her town. This is the summer that Penny turns thirteen.  This is the summer that she is forced to grow up.<br />THE CREEK has a very interesting take on gossip gone wrong. It incorporates growing up with childhood fears - which, perhaps, aren't so childish after all. Each character had a distinct personality, especially Penny, the heart of the story.  The point is never about redemption. Holm does not make Caleb have an emotional breakdown. He never begs and pleads to be forgiven. The point is, shall we say, much sharper than that.<br /><br />One of the best things about this novel is that it can take place in Anytown, USA and in nearly any of the past five decades. More and more teen books make too many references to show how hip they are, but by the time the book is published, what was hot a few months ago is now cold, and the mentions make the work feel dated.<br /><br />I highly recommend this novel. I look forward to reading other books by Holm. If you enjoyed THE CREEK, try Friction by E.R. Frank and The Crucible by Arthur Miller, both of which deal with hysteria within a community.es growing up with childhood fears - which, perhaps, aren't so childish after all.

US	45895653	R3FASQPEZQDMPD	0670035300	976305277	This Lullaby	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Perfect "Lullaby"	Last night, in spite of a migraine headache, I stayed up to finish THIS LULLABY by Sarah Dessen.  That is a testament to how engrossing her novels are.<br />The main character, Remy, does not believe in love after watching her mother go through marriage after marriage. Remy never knew her father, a rock star who wrote a song for her called \\"This Lullaby\\" which was a smash hit but included the line, \\"I will let you down.\\"<br />Remy is hesitant to get too close to people. Having seen so many men come in and out of her mother's life, she thinks that most people will hurt you and that most relationships are only temporary, so why get attached? She prefers to push them away instead - until Dexter stumbles into her life, pursues her and refuses to let her run away.<br />Though Remy is not a romantic girl, she's had her share of boyfriends. Though she may be cyncial, she is not cold nor a \\"loner,\\" enjoying the company of her three very different friends, Jess, Chloe and Lissa; her mother, a writer; and her older brother, who is slowly changing due to the influence of his prim and proper girlfriend.  Remy has a life, a job, a love for Zip Diet Coke. After working her tail off in high school and proving everyone wrong about her, she has a future at Stanford.<br />This book accurately shows how the summer between high school and college can change a person - and how, though others can influence you, you have to want to change in order for it to be true and beneficial.<br />I highly recommend all of Dessen's novels, with SOMEONE LIKE YOU and THIS LULLABY being the best of the bunch. Realistic and unpredictable, heartbreaking and heartwarming, THIS LULLABY is a must-read.	2003-06-01
US	45895653	R26IQNSQAG2YP5	0060012218	103393582	Geography Club	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Mark The Map	GEOGRAPHY CLUB, Brent Hartinger's debut novel, is a realistic coming-of-age story. It deals with a high school boy named Russel who realizes he isn't the only one at school questioning his sexuality. He along with a few others want to talk more about it, but are scared to speak openly or to create an Alliance that everyone would know about. Instead, they form the Geography Club, thinking that no one will want to join something that boring and that their secrets will be safe.<br />This very quick read takes an honest look at one young man coming to terms with who he is. The protagonist is not infalliable; the story is not preachy. You want to hug Russel once second and slap him the next as he goes through the ups and downs of high school. At times, he caves in to peer pressure; at others, he stands up for the truth.<br />Ultimately, this book is not about being gay or straight, being a boy or a girl, but about being who you are. We've all felt alienated at one point or another, and we've all felt alone when surrounded by people. This book should be an eye-opener for students and adults alike.	2003-04-07

I was struck again upon looking at the cover and seeing the photographed girl wearing a necklace which was the twin of my own.  The combined shocks made me immediately read the summary, which sounded like a typical coming-of-age story: Sari and Jess have been best friends for years, but upon entering ninth grade, Jess (the self-proclaimed sci-fi geek) feels like she is losing Sari (the prettier one).<br />However, this book is anything but typical. It is phenomonal. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. The work is much deeper than the title implies. <br />Jess is an artist and prefers sketching characters from her favorite comic book; Sari is far more into the high school scene, with status and popularity, and she falls very hard for a senior boy who is already in a committed relationship. This is no crush - this is an obsession, and the reader will truly worry about Sari as she lowers her standards and does things for a boy who is using her. Being a person who loves books set in the voice of the 'third wheel,' the person observing from afar, I found this book more powerful coming from Jess' point of view and applaud the author for chosing that writing style.<br />The book takes place over an entire school year, September through June, yet it moves along quickly and quite well.  After reading the book, I realized that the title was chosen not only to make people pick up the book, but to signify the space between - in this case, the space between the girls.<br />Highly recommended, especially for fans of Laurie Halse Anderson, Sarah Dessen and Carol Plum-Ucci.	2003-02-19

Set in Britain, this book revolves around Janet, a teenager who decides along with her best friend to enter the Dark Phase, or DP, of her life. She reflects on her dysfunctional family, her religious zealot of a grandmother, her free spirit aunt, the boy she likes, the things we do for love, her rival, the art and film industry, black clothing and hair dye.<br />If I had a nickel for every time I laughed out loud during the course of this book, I would be a rich woman indeed. The diary format is sure to please fans of Meg Cabot or Louise Rennison. Two thumbs up for this wickedly brilliant British gem.	2003-02-01

Written in first person present tense, it focuses on a teenager named Peggy. Middle name, Fleming. Her father is an amateur figure skater turned real estate agent and her mother is a very pregnant weather forecaster. Due to her father's career, the children all have been named in honor of famous skaters. The five year old twins are named Torvill and Dean. The quiet and thoughtful three year old is called Dorothy. That in itself is sure to crack up any skating fan - but wait, there's more.<br />Peggy, who opts to go by Fleming, has a very interesting summer. After getting into multiple car accidents - in which she remains unscathed, but sadly cannot say the same for the vehicles - she is no longer allowed to drive and gets a job at the local Gas 'n' Git to pay her father back. Meanwhile, she takes a French class taught by a string of unqualified substitutes, fights her attraction for the cute waiter at IHOP, befriends a girl named Charlotte with a wild streak and bickers with her co-worker, Denny, who has an obsession with U2 and often attempts to look, sound and act like his idol, Bono.<br />Anyone who has ever lived in a small town and dreamed of getting out of it will echo Fleming's thoughts about her city; anyone who has felt pressured to take care of their younger siblings will sympathize with her family plight. This book is all I have been talking about for days, and I will continue to yak about it until the cows come home.  With a solid ending that ties every subplot and character together, I give FROZEN RODEO a perfect score.	2003-02-01

I read Crazy Jack and, for whatever reason, did not like it very much the first time around.  A few months later, I picked up Sirena and did not regret it one iota. \\"Sirena\\" combines the Greek myths with sirens, nymphs and mermaids as well as Odysseus and Troy.  The mermaids are told that if they fall in love, they will become immortal.  Sirena, one such mergirl, distances herself from the school of nymphs she normally follows and ends up falling for a wounded man who was on his way to the war.  After a short while of tending to him without his knowing, she finally reveals her true nature to him and their relationship builds, slowly at first, then to a state in which they regard themselves as married. The book takes place over a few years so you do feel as if you get to know Sirena and fall into her normal daily pattern right along with her.  This book is the embodiment not just of the Greek myths, but of the saying: \\"If you love something, set it free. If it comes back to you, it is yours. If it doesn't , it never was.\\"	2002-09-22

Set over one thousand years in the future, this book finds the world's people not too far removed from our own 21st century folks - there are no aliens, no robots, no Jetsons-esque contraptions - except for the long strides made with human cloning, chromosome research and other genetic enhancements.  Those with bonus DNA and cultivated strengths are \\"Genhaunts,\\" and in an elevated position with regards to the \\"Originals.\\"  One young girl discovers there is more to her family's personal history and to the process and progress of society.  A good book for young readers interested in science or those wondering how cloning could happen.	2002-09-22

Told dominantly through journal entries and letters, the book  runs from January to December, following Jessica's life after her best friend Hope moves away.  Now she hangs out at school with three girls she really doesn't like, fights a crush on a drug-loving boy, and simply tries to make it from one day to the next.  This is a cute debut from Megan McCafferty that will certainly appeal to adults who have survived the high school experience and to the teens who are currently living it.  If you like a light comedy, if you liked The Princess Diaries or Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging, you'll enjoy Sloppy Firsts.	2002-09-22

It is all that I have been talking about since the moment I finished it.<br />At first glance, one might think Claire has it all. This high school cheerleader has a devoted best friend, a sought-after boyfriend and a group of elite buddies.  But if you look closer, you'll see not everything is as it seems. Claire's parents are divorced, her mother slowly turns to alcohol more and more, and Claire is in remission from leukemia, which took her out of school for a year.<br />Enter Lani Garver, the new kid at school. He is a few years older and quite a bit wiser than his small-town peers. At first, his long hair, slight build and tendency to giggle make his classmates think that he is a girl. He sets them straight but is still regarded as a freak by most.<br />Claire's path crosses with Lani's a few times in as many days. A whirlwind friendship begins that defies the teenage laws of who you hang out with.  With Claire as the protagonist, it becomes not just Lani's story but hers as well: her eyes being to open, and she learns - at times, the hard way - how the world works, how cruel some people can be, how kind others are.<br />This book is an amazing piece of work. It is a realistic anatomy of a hate crime that will make you think and leave you wondering about the state of the world.  It is an emotional experience.  I would not doubt that \\"What Happened to Lani Garver\\" will catch the attention of critics and book awards alike.  This is the very definition of a must-read.	2002-09-22

Carmen purchased a pair of jeans at a thrift shop quite some time earlier; before they go their separate ways for the summer, the girls vow to send the pants quite literally around the world, going from friend to friend. Each girl has her own storyline: Tibby inadvertantly makes a younger friend and tries not to be embarrassed by her first job; Lena visits her grandparents in Greece and paints to her heart's content; Bridget makes goals and wins over an older counselor at soccer camp; and Carmen tries to cope with the news that her father is getting remarried.  Personally, I found Tibby's story to be the most heartwrenching, but the girls and their trials were vastly different and will make the book appeal to a broad range of readers. Very enjoyable read, with more depth and realism than one might expect due to the title.  I definitely recommend this book to those who like movies and books about strong female characters and friendships, ranging from Have a Nice Life to Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood to Mystic Pizza.	2002-08-21

The Alice books are sweet without being sappy, real without being overdramatic. Alice is a quirky strawberry blond girl who is trying to figure out who she is and how this crazy thing called life works. However, Alice's original stories were for slightly older girls than the Judy Moody set, as they began when Alice was in junior high and continued into high school.<br />Luckily for younger readers, Naylor has decided to write three prequels featuring Alice in grade school. Starting With Alice features the protagonist at age 8, tackling a new town and the third grade with enthusiasm. Along the way, she makes some new friends, gets a cat, attends a wedding, attends a funeral, confronts bullies and continues to learn about the world around her.<br />I read this book cover to cover, with giggles and sighs in all the appropriate places. It was a delight to see Alice that young. I strongly recommend this and all of the Alice books to girls who like realistic books with a little bit of funny thrown in.	2002-08-21

I liked the original story but never truly loved it. I found this book to be a delightful presentation, putting it in a whole new light for me. Now I do love the story. Here, the token Sleeping Beauty is intelligent from the get-go. As a baby, she is granted her gifts by various fairies who attempt to out-do each other, each fairy trying to bestow a better trait than the fairy before her.  The parents fumble, the prince is a dud, and the princess rocks the house. Read it now. May it breathe new life into an old tale for you as it did for me.	2002-08-09

Quick read for all ages.	2002-08-09

Though all are lively and fabulous retellings of famous fairy tales, \\"The Princess Test\\" is one of the best. This sassy remake of \\"The Princess and the Pea\\" presents us with a fussy, fidgety, picky heroine who is prone to accidents and allergies. These traits hint that she above all people will be able to feel that pea underneath the multitude of mattresses when the time comes. This is a light, enjoyable book, great for the whole family to share or to treat yourself to on a breezy summer day.	2002-08-09

Several twists, actually. Instead of a heroine, we have a hero named Cinderellis. Instead of a prince, we have Princess Charming. Instead of a glass slipper, we have a glass hill which prospective suitors must climb on horseback. Instead of two ugly stepsisters, we have two not-so-bright brothers who never include Cinderellis in anything. Also, instead of waiting around for a fairy godmother, Cinderellis uses his potions and mixes - he's an inventor, you see - to make the perfect powder for the horse's hooves to stick to the glass. This inventive and heartwarming story gets two thumbs up from me. I love how smart these books are.	2002-08-09

All-American boy Jeremy loves his girlfriend Tara but is about to find out something about himself.  Danny is also a musician as well as a smart kid and class clown, but his bipolar medication is not letting him feel anything, good or bad, emotion-wise.  Jane has pressure from her parents and her friends to be the perfect student and the perfect musician.  Karyn has feelings for her best friend Reed, but is dating his older brother T.J.  Reed, also struggling with his thoughts about Karyn, is shining on the football field. Peter was in a car accident a month ago that left him paralyzed.<br />The seven were friends when they were younger. At Peter's 10th birthday party, something horrible happened - something which is revealed little by little as the books progressed - and some of the friendships dissolved. Now, as angst hits home with each teenager, they are starting to come back together.<br />The first novel, SHATTERED, serves as a good beginning for the series, starting with a party akin to that in 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU or other teen screen favorites. SHATTERED introduces you to each character in turn. By the end of the book, you feel sorry for Meena yet want to slap her back to reality.<br />These books are addicting. By being written in present-tense and leading you through the characters' lives on a daily basis for seven weeks straight, the books move quickly and hold your attention.  There is a little bit of something for everyone, with universal themes that anyone who has ever been in high school can relate to.	2002-07-22

Danny is the focus in book three, PUSHED.  This talented teen yearns to feel more emotions than his medication allows. The meds are having serious side effects, both physically and mentally. He is frustrated at his sudden inability to compose music and do other things that he used to love. Your heart can't help but go out to him as he tries desperately to reclaim his personality.<br />As another mini-tragedy strikes at the end of the book, you'll be on the edge of your seat and reaching for book four!	2002-07-22

The neighbors are friendly, if not a bit odd and a bit confused, repeatedly calling her \\"Caroline\\" by mistake.  The little girl is a self-proclaimed explorer, taking walks around the neighborhood no matter what the weather.  With both of her parents occupied by work, she counts the doors at home, and figures out how to open up a door which is supposed to open up to nowhere - more specifically, a brick wall...<br />Coraline's curious nature is akin to that of Alice (in Wonderland), Anne (of Green Gables) and other historical young heroines. Far from being a damsel in distress, Coraline is witty, intelligent and aware. Her 'White Rabbit' comes in the shape of a black cat who has no name; as he wryly explains to her, cats know who they are so they don't need names, unlike insecure human beings.<br />\\"Coraline\\" is a fantastic read for all ages, genders and critters. This is a book to read late at night when huddled under the covers with a flashlight. The gothic feel of this book will please long-time Neil Gaiman fans as well as fans of classic dark fairy tales.	2002-07-07

Though Eric's father left before Eric can remember, he did inherited his dad's chubby genes. In grade school, he befriended Sarah Byrnes, a girl whose face was burned (she claims from a pot of spaghetti) when she was 3. Now in high school, the usually witty and spry Sarah Byrnes suddenly stops talking one day and is placed at a psych ward.<br />Though the summary on the back of the book makes you think the plot revolves around Eric staying overweight for Sarah, it's not; he's shed some weight via sports, and that is simply one of the many events referred to in the book. The story is truly about Eric balancing the many aspects of his life: visiting Sarah; trying to find out what truly happened to her when she was young; catching the eye of a girl (Jody) he likes; enjoying his achievements on the swim team; and speaking his mind in an amazing class - Contemporary American Thought, called CAT for short - in which the kids openly discuss religion, abortions, peer pressure, and the like.<br />The debates in CAT class are worth getting the book alone. Combine those with a smart writing style, three dimensional modern teenage characters, multi-faceted plots and a climatic finish, and you have one eye-opening and engaging novel.	2002-06-04

US	45895653	R392RWHW5LUNM1	0061097497	113337875	Other Worlds	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Get the Geist	I had not read any of her works as either Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters before, so this was my introduction to her work. This mystery is actually two stories in one, with each story around 100-120 pages long. I preferred the first to the second; both dealt with families being tormented by a spirit of some kind or poltergeist activity. At the close of each story, the ghostly gentleman's club - including Harry Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - draw various conclusions. Thus there is not just one right answer, but instead various opinions and scenarios. Good work, quick read, fun for classic mystery / poltergeist fans.	2002-04-03

This cute fantasy read combines covered carts, a family of performers, ancient secrets revealed, and musical instruments that become magical.  The plot and characters were well developed for the first book in a quartet. I had already read some of Jones other fantasy works and, as with those, this book intrigued me. Your heart goes out to the children who are forced to grow up quickly and make difficult choices once their father is killed and their destiny is revealed. I look forward to reading the other books in the series.	2002-04-03

Topics include England, America, divorce, fairy tales, and skeletons in the family closet.<br />A man nearing 40 is getting a divorce from his wife and has to re-evaluate his life. He discovers a dark fairy tale book written by his mother, who killed herself when he was 6, and he has very little recollection of her. Tracking down his mother's friends and reading the stories help him learn about his past, his family and himself.<br />The writing style is very smart. The dark fairy stories within the book are killer and they neatly parallel what happened in the mother's past as well as the protagonist's present. The story starts off right in the middle of his moving out of his house, and then continues on a steady pace, building and spiraling until the end.<br />This book was right up my alley. I look forward to reading more works by Amanda Craig.	2002-04-03
US	45895653	RDOBRCAFOCDW6	0689845324	938743103	What's in a Name	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Field Day	I read the bulk of What's In a Name? in one sitting. The story is actually 8 chapters - 1 narrator per chapter - and set in a small town which is debating over changing its name. Each story has a character exploring his or her identity and the meaning of their popularity, sexuality, long term boyfriends/girlfriends, family, friends, school, future and so forth.<br />It was a very quick and enjoyable read. I enjoyed Ellen's writing style. The teens were thoughtful, not vacant; they spoke like kids but also didn't say \\"like\\" or curse every other line.  I only wish there had been one final wrap-up chapter to catch us up one last time with all of the characters we had met. However, I like the book as a hold and recommended to friends who liked small town coming-of-age novels.	2002-04-03
US	45895653	R3WX11DLOGDX6	0345435028	580214343	What We Keep	Books	4	1	1	N	N	It's a Keeper	I don't typically read mainstream fiction, but I'm glad I picked up this book. In the present tense, a 47 year old woman starts out on a plane trip to see her mother - she hasn't seen her in 35 years, since she was 12. It flashes back and forth to that eventful summer when she was 12 and her whole life changed and her trip now. Very smart work. If you like shows like State of Grace or The Wonder Years, or books like The Virgin Suicides or Beaches, you'll like this novel.	2002-04-03

I loved all of the characters, especially Momo - You'll want to sweep her up and adopt her! The little comments on daily life and work will make you stop and think. Anyone who is fascinated with the concept of time and/or  loves The Neverending Story - READ. THIS. BOOK.	2002-04-03
