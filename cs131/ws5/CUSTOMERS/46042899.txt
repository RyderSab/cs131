Although written in 1985, a few years prior to the internet being in every home, White noise is strangely prophetic. <br />The Gladney's go about there daily lives with TV's blaring in the background handing out curious bits of factoids. It would be difficut to call the Gladney's disfunctional, even though the children were products of multiple marriages of both parents. Even though they communicate well with each other they all seem a bit paranoid and therefore a bit off center. Jack Gladney is a professor of Hitler studies at the University and his wife Babbette is a housewife. The Hitler studies is farcical to the point that Jack is encouraged to dress and look like the Fuhrer. After a chemical accident,which forces the family to temporarily flee their home, their lives are forever changed. Babbette, preoccupied with death goes to some bizarre methods to ease her paranoia. Jack, after the toxic spill,  becomes convinced that he has acquired a fatal dosage of insecticide poisoning. He becomes suspicious of his wife and obssessed with the scientist who is experimenting on her. Even the chidren catch on to the paranoia.<br />Darkly funny, White Noise, is a good time and intersting study of modern Americana.	2004-04-03

I suppose that Christians are not nearly as fanatical as their Muslim counterparts.<br />Rushdie is first and foremost a very gifted writer. His 'pigeon english' dialogue is very funny and his prose can be very insightful. The Satanic Verses is a classic tale about good vs evil but it is hard to distinguish between the two.<br />Two Indians, one an actor and one an ex-patriot, fall from the sky into the Engish Channel. One is the fallen angel turned actor Gibreel and the other a mortal, Salludin, who wants to disassociate himself from his native India. As the two transform, Rushdie deals with subjects such as superstition, racism, and short sighted religous ideologies. If the reader can open up their imagination the The Satanic Verses can be like a magic carpet ride.	2004-01-25

However his direct style and story telling ability is still preferrrable to some of his British contemporaries.<br />The story centers around that of the ruling gentry and their contempt for anyone a little different from themslves. Interestingly enough Forster's most booring characters seem to be the Anglican clerics who are more interested in gossip and self importance that serving their constituents.<br />The novel begins in Florence admidst the many treasures that adorn that City and concludes in the beautiful English countryside. The hero, Lucy, is embarrassed by her own attraction to the Emersons's, Father and Son, who are clearly not of her class. She is encouraged by her stuufy cousin and a couple of old maids who are staying at the same hotel to avoid the Emersons. Mr. Emerson is a true romantic and his style is much to direct for their comfort and his quiet son George is much too gloomy.<br />Lucy is so taken off balance by young George Emerson that she cuts short her stay in Florence and flees to Rome and then home. At home she becomes engaged to a dull and pretentious man who her Mother and brother dislike.<br />By coincidence the Emerson's let a house from Lucy's fiance and Lucy is confronted with George.

Phillip Carey an orphan is raised by his Aunt and Uncle, an Anglican clergeyman. Phillip is ultra sensitive about his deformed foot and his Uncle's indifference.

He then takes his inheritance and goes to Paris to study painting. He discovers that he only has marginal talent and returns to England to study medicine.<BR>It is while in medical school that the most compelling part of the novel comes to life. Phillip falls miserbly in love with Milldred, an ill tempered and morally corrupt woman of a much lower class than Phillip. Mildreds descent into the abyss very nearly brings Phillip with her. Phillip finally finds himself when he befreiends a typesetter and his family and Phillip yearns for the simple and happy life that the family enjoys.<br />The novel is Dickens like in its deaths and depressive environs. The plight of a Paris classmate is the most poingnent of the various sub-plots. Phillip Carey is truly a Dickens like hero who chases forbidden love. The reader agonizes as Phillip is abused over and over again by Mildred. Of Human Bondage is worth the 800 pages.	2003-06-22

Yet where Dreisser wrote stylishly, Farrells's prose seems simplistic and crude and his dialogue filled with cliches. The Suds Lonigan story would fit in well with Dos Passo's USA trilogy. <br />From a social prespective is where Studs Lonigan gets its fame. Its indictment of working class Irish immigrants and the Catholic church must have been, at the time, very controversial. One can draw parralels of the life of Studs Lonigan and his ultimate fate to black youths in today's inner cities.  <br />The first book starts with the graduation of Studs from middle school. During the summer after his graduation the two most important acheivements in Studs'life occur- (1) he defeats a local tough in a fist fight and (2) he kisses the girl he idolizes. For the rest of his life Studs, tries to replicate those two events. <br />In Book 2 Studs effectively seals his fate by boozing and carousing, to the detriment of both his psyche and his health. By the end of Book 2, Studs' future prospects have all but been eliminated and his reputation in his own mind as a tough guy is ruined when he is beaten up at a party by the very youth that Studs had beaten up as a youngster. His attempts at finding a good woman are crude and ineffective.<br />By Book 3 Studs is demoralized and physically ill. His tough guy image is further depleted when his younger brother beats Studs up. Also in Book 3, the Depression has all but ruined Stud's chance to reach any kind of financial security. Even though Studs finds a nice girl who he plans to wed, he is too far gone in both spirit and body to recover.	2003-04-27

Not only was Conrad a gifted storyteller but he is equally adept at both charcater develpoment and descriptiveness. The Secret Agent is the story of a double agent who becomes a pawn,not only of the government he supposedly represents but with the British officials who have turned him. Trying to impress his handlers, he decides to plant a bomb that ends in tragedy for his own family.Conrad's portyal of anarchists as a bumbling lot with their own self serving agenda is the important point that is characteristic of all of Conrad's woks.<br />The Secret Agent is not a stylishly written as Nostromo and lord Jim and is a bit faster paced.

The rich Victorian language, the complicated sentence structure, and the unending paragraphs are just a few of the problems that the reader encounters.<br />The story is very well conceived and contains the same moral dellimas that are characteristic of other James' novels. The plot turns around a rich and naive American girl,( James seems to portray most Americans as either naive ar crude) who is dying and the schemeing couple who want to make the most of the situation. The story is further complicated by the love and respect that the deceivers have for the dying girl.<br />Good luck because The Wings of the Dove is both long and complicated.	2003-03-10

Humbert is a lecherous and insane middle aged man with a fettish for young nymphets like his 'Lolita'. His passion for Lolita is a sickness and should in no way be remotely compared to love.<br />Lolita is a comedy pure and simple. Read into it any more than that and you are missing the point.

Waugh is easily the most readable of the great British authors of the 20th century.'A Handful of Dust' is not as funny as 'SCOOP' but it is sharp satire of British society. The book has alternate endings and I prefer the one where Tony and Brenda reunite.<br />The story centers around the Last family, principally Tony and his wife Brenda. All the elements of the demise of a marriage are contained in this masterpiece - a stodgy husband, a cheating wife, and a tragic death. Beware ladies because the females in the novel are on a whole as weak and superficial a group as ever encountered. Waugh at the time of its writing was reportedly recovering from a failed romance and no doubt was influenced by a jilting fiance. Brenda Last,in particular, is a character you will love to dislike. Brenda's infatuation with the 'neer do well' mama's boy, John Beaver, stretches the reader's imagination.<br />Both conclusions are appropiate and you will be staisfied with either.	2003-01-12

Suppossedly she was a novelist/philsopher but,if 'Under the Net' contained any grandiose phillisophical theories, I must have missed them. But I accept the fact that Ms. Murdoch must have been one of the finest minds of her era.  I found the novel fast paced and easy to read and the humor, typical of the British, very subtle.<br />It was interseting that a female author would have a male protagonist and narrator. The hero, Jake Donahue, is a frustrated author turned interpretter of foreign novels. He is displaced from his residence by his landlady/lover and,in his attempt to find another place to live, he is reunited with an ex-lover and in the process is re-introduced to several other people from his past.<br />In the midst of Jake's search for his own self worth, he comes into contact with several intersting people in both the world of books and films.  In one of the most light hearted episodes, Jake and his cronies, Dave and Finn, manage to kidnap a dog film star and Jake becomes the aging dog's protector. Through his protection of the dog, Jake uncovers in himself a gentler side that he did not know existed.<br />Whether Jake's misfortunes are due to betrayl by his friends or by his own stubborness and laziness is not quite clear. However at the end the reader has the sense that Jake is truly a better person for all his travails.	2002-12-09

Younger workers and upcoming managers clash against older workers and management.

Dr. Copeland is a black physician suffering from TB who is estranged from his own family by his passionate devotion to protecting the rights of his race; Jake Blount, an alcoholic and border-line psychotic, who is tormented by his radical ideas of the rights of the working class, Biff Brannon a restaurant owner who is trying to come to terms with his own feelings following the death of his wife; and Mick Kelly, a sensitive teenage girl and daughter of the family who own the boarding house where the mute lives, .<br />The four feel a special kinship to the mute, Mr. Singer, because of the sensitivity that each one must sense in him. Singer listens to their stories and asks them questions yet he gives little advice. Singer himself is a depressed by the decline, both physically and mentally, and institutionalization of his constant companion, another deaf mute, whose fate ultimately has a profound affect on Singer and his four confidants.  <br />The book deals subtly with several different social issues-racial strife in the South, a teenage girl coming to terms with her emerging sexuality, labor unrest, and the effect of the Great Depression on the middle class.	2002-11-27

The trials and tribulations of the Compson family are told in 4 parts covering four separate days. The first three parts are narrated by the Compson sons-Benji, Quinton, and Jason-and the last part is written in third person.<br />Mr. Compson is a good man who drinks himself to an early grave. Mrs Compson is a proud southern lady who instead of dealing with her family's problems declares herself an invalid and escapes to her room. She leaves the child rearing to the servents. She is so vain that when she becomes aware of her youngest son's disbility, she changes his given name from Maury to Benjamin so as to not embarrass her brother Maury, who he was named after.<br />Quinton is an introspective loner who has trouble distinguishing between reality and fiction. Benji is a retarded man child given to fits and totally disregarded by his mother, his brother, and his neice. Jason is a cold and brutal racist, who blames his unhappiness on his family.<br />The sister Caddy is the only sibling who shows any love toward Benji. Her loose morals however eventually estrange her from the rest of the family. Caddy's daughter, also named Quinton, (ostensibly Faulkner's way of further confusing the reader) is left to be raised by her totally removed grandmother and her cold and brutal Uncle Jason. The girl Quinton, like the rest of the family, detests being in the same room with her Uncle Benji.<br />The servants, especially Dilsey, run the household. Dilsey is truly the only character with any strength. Luster, Dilsey's lazy grandson who takes care of Benji, provides some comic relief as he tries to avoid work like a plague.<br />Part 1 is narrated by Benji whose thoughts skip back and forth in time. Benji's incoherent thoughts are difficult to understand especially since Faulkner throws the reader right into the action without any explanation. One thing that the reader easily understands is that Benji truly misses his sister Caddy who he is constantly looking for both in thought and action.<br />Part 2 is narrated by Quinton and takes place in Boston on June 2 1910. Quinton, a student at Harvard, is not retarded like Benji but he is clearly disturbed. Quinton is fixated on the disgrace that has been brought to the family by Caddy. Quinton's devotion for his sister is filled with incestuos innuendos and he has a difficult time distinguishing between fantasy and reality. In my opinion this is truly the strongest part of the novel. Faulkner uses a watch with broken hands symbolizes Quintons quest to stop time.<br />Part 3 is narrated by Jason who is a racist bully who has clearly been damaged by his dysfunctional family. By default, Jason has become the Compson patriarch. Jason is resentful of the fact that the family spent their last savings to send Quinton to college and there was nothing left for him. He hates Caddy because she did not marry the man who promised him a job in a bank. He despises having to look after Benji and he hates the servants.<br />Part 4 concludes the story and deals with the stuggles of Caddy's daughter, Quinton, who learns that Jason has stolen money that Caddy has been sending regularly for Quinton's upbringing.<br />Although Faulkner can be difficult this an emotion charged novel that ranks close the top of the best of fiction written in the 20th century. Faulkner is difficult but unlike some of his contemporaries, Joyce for instance, he is not impossible.	2002-11-16

How it is included in the best novels of the 20th Century by the New York Times is beyond me. The book was begun more than 30 years before 1900. Although completed in 1872, it lay unpublished for nearly 30 years; presumably until such time as some of its anti-Victorian ideals would be more palatable to the British public.<br />The story principally centers around the life of Ernest Pontifex, an impreesionable and naive young man who is reared by devout Anglican parents. Their well meaning cruelty shelter Ernest and cause him to make bad decisions and derail his ambitions. As a result of the consequences of these bad decisions, Ernest learns to manage his own life and becomes a success despite his early failures.   <br />Although important in its time, the novel is brutally slow.	2002-07-24

In particular, Dos Passos chronicles the history of the labor movement in the US and the revolt of working class worldwide. <br />It is intersting to note that at the time that this book was written, Dos Passos was a frevent socialist/communist. By the time of his death, he had renounced the communist idealogies for a more conservatine viewpoint.<br />Although, the fictional prose is simplistic and the dialogue somewhat cliched, a powerful story is told. The world is seen through the eyes of several ordinary citizens, all with different backgrounds and from different classes. The characters lives interwave through important world events such as labor unrest, Mexican revolution, World War 1, and the Russian Revolution. <BR> <BR>Interwoven throughout the fiction are snippets that attempt to educate the reader. The 'Camera Eye' passages are newspaper headlines and attempt to capture the mood of the day. There are sections of Dos Passos's own thoughts of the day, some of them written as Dos Passos as a child might have seen them. My favorite sections were the short autobiographies of important citizens- among them Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Eugene Debs, Woodrow Wilsoon, and Emma Goldberg.<br />If you are lookiong for a passionate or suspenseful fictional story, this is not the book for you. But if you are intersted in history, especially American History, this book is excellent in capturing the mood of first third of the 20th century.	2002-05-27

Waugh's wit, unlike other so called British humorists, is funny even to a colonial like me.<br />Through a wonderfully hilarious mistaken identity, William Boot is sent to Africa by the daily newspaper The Beast on rumors that the country of Ishmalea is on the verge of revolution. Waugh's portrayal of Lord Copper, the newspaper magnate, Lady Stitch, and Slater,the newspaper's foreign editor, is very funny.<br />Boot is the newspaper's reporter of farm news and is flabergasted at Cooper and Slater's insistence that he go to Ishmalea to cover the revolution. He reluctantly agrees to go only because of the opportunity it presents to fly in an airplane.<br />Upon arriving in Ishmalea, Boot is united with foreign correspondents of other European and American newspapers. He quickly discovers that there really is no news to report and that for the most part the other reporters are making thier own news. Most of the stories are genrated by the infamous Lord Hitchcock who rarely leaves his hotel room.<br />While in Ishmalea, Boot meets a mysterious German girl, who he falls madly in love with. Boot reports on a mini-revolution that lasts about a day. For his good work, Boot is recalled home to a hero's welcome by The Beast.<br />Boot desires to return to his agrarian lifestyle much to the dismay of Lord Cooper who sends Slater to the country to persuade Boot to stay on at the Beast and to attend a banquet in his honor. Slater's visit to the Boot homestead is truly hillarious.<br />In a wonderful irony John Boot, the novelist that Lord Cooper intended to send to Ishmalea, is knighted for his work at the bequest of Lord Cooper and then sent to Antartica as a foreign correspondent.	2002-05-10

Binx comes from a wealthy New Orleans family and is idealized by his great aunt Emily who is the matriarch of the Bolling family. Emily though tries to micro manage Binx' life and he feels somehow unworthy of her adoration<br />Binx' problem is that he wonders what life is really about and in particular what is his own life is supposed to be about. His search for meaning takes him to see movies all over the metro 'Big Easy' and chase the skirts of the various secretary that happens to work for him at the time. Binx finds analogies to life in the various movies that he sees.<br />Adding to Binx'complications is his cousin Kate, who is an emotional wreck. Kate's emotions may or may not have been the result of the death of her fiance in an automobile wreck in which Kate herself was injured. Binx is counted on by the family as being able to help Kate through some of her more difficult times. Binx attributes his success with Kate as his ability to accept her mood swings without emotion; Kate is simply being Kate and her behaviour is typical and predictable if you compare it to how Kate acts.<br />At the spur of the moment, Binx and Kate go off together to a convention in Chicago and this really upsets Aunt Emily, who also happens to be Kate's stepmother. Emily and Binx are able to repair thier relationship as Emily finally decides to stop traeting Binx like the prodigal son and instead like a normal person with flaws just like everyone else.<br />Somehow this book misses its point and leaves a lot of unanswered questions. Is Binx' aloofness in any way a result of his war eperience? Do Binx and Kate really love each other or are they simply convenient for each other given their oddness? Does Binx truly achieve a repriesal from the malaise that he considered life to be?	2002-04-02

Books	4	2	5	N	N	Malcolm Lowrey Self-portrait	If you read an autobiography of Lowery you realize how close his own life parrallels that of Geoffery Firmin and to a lesser extent the brother Hugh. Malcolm Lowery was himself an unpleasant drunk just like his protaganist the Counsel(Geoffery). Lowrey also spent a considerable amount of time in and around the Mexican state of Oxaxaca and he spent some time as a seaman. More importantly Lowery eperienced the euphorias, the blackouts, and the hallucinations that the Counsel suffered.  <br />The action starts on the eve of the 'Day of the Dead' Mexico's annual day of mourning and celebration for the dead. M. Laurelle remembers the day exactly one year ago and the tragedy that occurred. The rest of the action took place during the previous years Day of the Dead. Laurelle is a childhood friend of Geoffery and the fromer lover of Yvonne. <br />At the time of the action, the late 1930's, Mexico and Britain have broken off diplomatic relations and the Counsel had been releived of duty. The Counsel stays in Mexico, deeply buried  inside the bottle. On this day his estranged wife Yvonne, an American born actress, arrives at the Counsel's hacienda to try to rekindle theit love.Also in Mexico is the Counsel's brother Hugh who harbors affection for Yvonne but longs to fight with his socialist brothers in the Spanish Revolution. <br />Hugh is in Mexico ostensibly to try to save his brother from self-destruction but it is apparant from his actions and words that he has give up all hope. He warns Yvonne that you can not make a pet of an armadillo as the armadillo will dig a hole and carry the person that is trying to tame it in the hole right after.(An obvious analogy to the Counsel).<br />Meanwhile, Yvonne arrives to find the Counsel in the same state as he was when she left- blind drunk. Throughout the day the Counsel drifts in and out of sobriety and his personality wavers between being contrite and antagonistic. The trio decide to travel by bus to another village where a rodeois being held. During the bus ride they spy the badly beaten body of an Indian and his horse (branded with the number 7 on its rump). They also witness a local thug who steals the dead Indian's possessions. They are outraged but due to the corruptness of the regional police, could do nothing. The incident bothers the trio just the same. The horse ironically appears again during the last two chapters of the book.<br />The Counsel who later in the day starts drinking Mexican whiskey (mescal)becomes quite belligerent and his obscenities force Hugh and Yvonne to desert him at a cantina. Hugh and Yvonne decide to hike the rugged volcano which results in tragedy. In the meantime the Counsel is accosted by local thugs who accuse him of being a communist. It is here that the Counsel meets the fate,that the reader knows early on,is his destiny.  <br />Under the Volcano is a very difficult read partly beacuse of Lowrey's brilliance and party because it is told through the eyes of a raging alcoholic.	2002-04-01

The ship collides with something in calm waters and is in imminent danger of sinking. Much to Jim's dismay the Captain and crew decide to abandon ship leaving the pilgrims to fend for themselves. Jim does what he can but in an impulsive moment of terror finds himslef jumping from the ship to save himself. Incredibly the ship does not sink and the passengers are rescued by another ship.<br />Rather than run away from his responsibilities like the ship's captain. Jim answers the charges of the maritime review board. At the inquiry, Jim becomes aware of the presence of Marlowe, the story teller in 'The Heart of Darkness'.<br />Marlowe recognizes something honorable in Jim and becomes interested in Jim's well being. The court ruling forbiding Jim to officer another ship for the rest of his life is not nearly as harsh as Jim's own self incrimination.<br />Marlowe assists Jim in finding work as &quot;water clerk&quot; and Jim drifts around the South Seas, never staying very long in one place. Marlowe persuades an old merchant friend to hire Jim to manage one of the remote trading posts that he owns. Jim is dispatched to an island in Malaysia to releive another man who is dishonest.

Carol's first impression of Gopher Prarie is that of a drab country town inhabited by drab people. Carol's attempts to bring both social consciousness and culture to Gopher Prarie is resisted by the residents.Carol is misunderstood and villified by the town's leading citizens. As a result she is drawn to the city's undesirables; particularly an anarchist named Miles Bjornstrom and a young tailor with whom carol has a flirtation with.<br />Carol's husband, Dr. Kennicott, is also perplexed by his wife's behaviour . Eventually Carol leaves her husband and moves to Washington DC to pursue a career away from Gopher Prarie. After a lengthy separation, Carol moves back to Gopher Prarie and resumes her marriage.    <br />This satirical look at both small time life and social reformation, is an interesting character study. Lewis' realistic style is simmilar to other American writers of his generation such as Dreisser and Sherwood Anderson. The sexual tension is affected by Victorian Age purity of the time but effective nevertheless.<br />The conclusion is rather depressing in that Carol finds herself submitting to Gopher Prarie as the residents of Gopher Prarie likewise submit to having to endure Carol.	2001-12-01

He could have easily portrayed Bigger as a misunderstood youth used and abused by the white establishment. Instead much to the dismay of intellectual blacks, Bigger is cowardly and brutish. The novel is important for the reasons that Bigger did what he did. <br />Hired as a chaufer by a rich and liberal white family, Bigger Thomas is treated warmly by the family. On his first day on the job, Bigger drives the daughter and her lover around town. The two young people treat Bigger as an equal and this terrifies him. Bigger can not understand their actions toward him and his fear turns into hate. Through a series of bad luck and equally bad decisions, Bigger finds himself on trial for a brutal murder. <br />The real meat of the novel appears in the brilliant court room summation made by Bigger's communist lawyer, Max.

The language is a bastardized English, combining the King's English, ancient Hindi,Persian and varoius regional dialects. Rushdie does his best at giving the reader a glimpse of just how complicated India is with its different religions and customs.The humor is very tongue in cheek and prevelant throughout. Rushdie uses variations of spelling and punctuation to accentuate his drama and humour.	2001-04-25

Dreiser leaves little to the reader's imagination as he explains every detail with percision.<br />Clyde Griffiths is a young man with ambition who longs for a better life than that of his parents, who are street missionaries. First he flees his Kansas City home after getting into some minor trouble. By chance, Clyde meets his wealthy uncle by chance and secures a job in the family collar factory in New York State.<br />Clyde, thanks to the family name, is quickly brought into the social scene of his new hometown. He develops a relationship with a co-worker (Roberta) but as soon as a young lady of wealth and social status (Sondra)shows favor to him, Clyde looses interest in Roberta. The affair with Roberta produces a pregnancy and the situation spins out of Clyde's control. Eventually Clyde's self interests outweigh his sense of right and wrong, resulting in tragedy. <br />From the first few pages you get a sense that Clyde's ambitions  will eventually be his undoing. Drieser leaves very little to the reader's imagination as he weaves you through 800 pages of intricate detail. At the end Clyde comes to terms with his deeds and confesses his sins to both GOD and himself.	2001-03-18

Women in Love was written with much more passion than The Rainbow, dealing with the realtionships of two sisters and their lovers.<br />The charcater's all seem to be on the verge of madness with their emotins running amok between love and hate for each other.<br />Lawrence was proported to be depressed by the treatment of his works by the censors. This book is not pornographic but it does have an implication of homosexuality that would have shocked the readers of 1918. I wonder about Lawrence's own sexuality as both the Rainbow and Women in Love lightly deal with homosexual relationships.	2001-01-07

About half way through I started reading it aloud and I have to admit that I admire James mastery of the English language. However the plot was dull and plodding and I neither liked nor admired any of the charcters.<br />The theme seemed to be that Americans were stuffy and dull while Europeans were cultured and cosmopilitan. From what I have read of James, he preffered Europe to his native America. I am assuming i will find the same theme in other James works.	2000-12-29
