This most remarkable literary duet tells at one time the story of the evolution of Adie Klarpol from discouraged commercial artist to inspired cyber-expresionist, and the devolution of Taimur Martin from confident teacher to abject political prisoner.<br />The simultaneous tales are intertwined, not unlike the famed double-helix, and it was not unusual to find the reader lost among the two strands, not firmly affixed to either.  I expect that this is one intent of the author as he ponders and prys at our concepts of perception and reality.<br />The vast constrast between the two states of being is emphasized by Powers' phenomenal grasp of the tools and methods of Virtual Reality, and by his heart-breaking comprehension of the destruction of a personality when isolated and abused with no apparent end.  The one experience being filled to overflowing with creative juices and ecstatic growth as a team of cyber-pioneers strives to complete their concept of ultimate human expression; the other being brutally and relentlessly drained of all possibility of sanity or life.<br />I am greatly interested in views of the near future and imaginative glimpses of what we may next become if only we survive the process.  Survival entails accomodating to the ever faster change that, while driven by commercial interest, revolutionizes our perception of our lives, ourselves and our relationship to all else on a daily basis.  We recognize from grim experience, that the tools and methods of this change can be at once beneficial and deadly.  Adie's growing realization of the dark side of her accomplishments, at first art and now weapon, forces a final convulsive transformation of her work into a possibility of redemption and hope.<br />Taimur's brutal descent into nothingness similarly unleashes a convulsive transformation into ultimate understanding.  I am still pondering the relationship that the author draws between the two.....<br />I agree with most reviewers, that Power's work is a strenuous read.  It is densely packed with image and emotion and too rich to be taken quickly or lightly.  The characters are all complex and worthy of our attention.  The ideas are important and gloriously expressed.<br />I am now recovering from &quot;Plowing The Dark&quot; in preparation for entering another Powers masterpiece.<br />Highly recommended.trenuous read.

Massucci has given us a fascinating look at the possible downfall of western civilization should an evil cybergenius get loose.<br />In this many level story the, now happily past, Y2K issue is used as a mask for a much more insidious plan to gain boundless fortune and power.  The main characters are that very evil genius, a 3 person highly trained and skillful special forces strike team, a number of top computer and biotech scientists, and Albert, the first functional biocomputer.  In addition, there are a great number of tough and/or brilliant, good and/or evil players who are all blown away using various interesting and/or grotesque forms of military armament and/or civilian fatal devices.<br />Despite some truly grotesque concepts that still haunt me, I must proclaim this a captivating adventure, beautifully wrought with real characters involved in a fascinating struggle to the death to save themselves, their friends and US.  It's a fast and consuming read.<br />Go for it!!!!	2001-07-14

I must say &quot;thank you&quot;!<br />I suppose that this genre is military action and I was fascinated by the wealth of real or imagined information about the methods and armaments of modern warfare that were incorporated into this exciting triple thriller.  The plots were well played out by very interesting characters, particularly the almost unbreakable Ice Trencrom.  I learned enough about his past and his motivation to want to meet him again in another undercover bout.<br />The story of a computer gone bad pretty much places this book in the realm of cyberpunk, but I think that persons not highly detail oriented with a strong curiosity about what specifically might get dumped on them if civilization crosses the dark line will suffer from data overload.<br />I liked it a lot!  It's realistic and pretty scary, fast moving and a very good read.  I hopefully await the forthcoming battle royal between Trencrom and the Hawkman - dont' disappoint us!	2001-07-10

I greatly enjoyed this Gibson novel; the only down side being the nagging feeling that it eventually had to end.<br />Exciting action and scenes peopled by a curious lot on the bleeding edge of a distopian society. I found them all interesting and followed their interwoven paths with relish. I particularly appreciated the Zen-like assassin who was just barely there as he so skillfully glided through the tale leaving a trail of bodies in his non-wake.<br />This is not a ponderable exposition; it is a brief tearing blazing no holds barred look into the marginal lives of the unfortunates drawn inexorably into a vortex of great change centered on the post-quake Oakland Bay Bridge.<br />There's plenty of Cyber, there's plenty of Punk; this one really rocks and I loved it!	2001-07-06

I also felt Smith's exposition on the nature of God and the angels to be overdrawn and yet another grasp for a way out of an interesting but failed plot.<br />Mind you, I did like the writing enough to just order 2 more of Smith's earlier and highly praised works, but I'd recommend letting this sleeping dog lie.	2001-06-27

I've spent many involved hours happily immersed in Vernor Vinges wonderful tales, but I was disappointed in &quot;A Deepness In The Sky&quot;.<br />The characters were unusual and interesting, but seemed only half there.  Just enough history was given to bring them to life, but they all remained sadly flat.  There was great but unrealized potential in all of them.<br />Similarly, I found the story interesting and seething with potential, but found it, too, sadly flat.<br />This is a long and interesting journey, but there are many better tales by Vinge and others that would be time and imagination better spent.	2001-06-22

I am blessed with forgetfulness in my reading so that even though &quot;Ender's Game&quot; which I read long ago blew all of my fuses and became one of my most recommended and praised books, I retained just enough of the earlier story to have it add some real spice to this one.<br />I must also say that even though I pretty well knew the expected ending to &quot;Ender's Shadow, I thoroughly enjoyed this parallel tale.  Bean is a fascinating character in his own right, and it was a pleasure watching him almost grow up in this book.<br />Card's gripping action and fine portrayals of all of his players always leaves me wanting more.<br />If you haven't yet read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (say what????), do yourself an immense favor and get it now!  I would definitely read that one before this later work.  If you have read it, I would strongly recommend &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; as an excellent provoker of memories of that book, but also one that stands up strongly for itself.	2001-06-08

I breathlessly trailed along with his characters racing towards their uncertain fates as their dark world of Manchester bubbled and squirmed under the influence of the Blurbflies that were inexorably saturating their consciousness.<br />And then, and then...... no biggy.<br />If you have the time, read this one for the trip, but not for the destination.	2001-06-08

This sequel continues the very strange tale of the main character Cley as he tries to make amends for his grotesque previous life and tries to understand life itself.<br />He has established himself in the remote settlement of Wenau as a healer, and feels that he is finally on a good path when his evil master Drachton Below attempts to destroy Cley and the town by infecting it with a deadly sleeping sickness.<br />Trying to return to Below to extract the cure from him, Cley learns that Below is himself infected with the same sickness and is slowly dying.  The only way left to find the cure is to make a perilous journey directly into the mind of Below where he will hopefully discover the answer before Below dies taking Cley with him.<br />As with &quot;The Physiognomy&quot;, the writing is gripping and extraordinary.  The concepts are totally new to me and add fascinating possibilities to the ongoing question of how reality may be truly perceived.<br />Fascinating characters clearly wrought, and an astounding plot expertly presented in stunning language leave me, as before, with an intense desire for MORE!<br />If you enjoyed &quot;The Physigiognomy&quot;, this sequel is a must.  I strongly recommend reading them in order as &quot;Memoranda&quot; relies heavily on the history of the previous tale.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-05-30
US	53084715	R3CDQBC45Q5AGX	0553580264	934920024	Tropic of Creation	Books	5	7	7	N	N	It doesn't get much better than this!	I am obliged to give one of my very rare 5-star reviews to Kay Kenyon for a deep, complex, exciting and most satisfying novel.<br />In this tale, failing starship Captain Eli Dammond finds himself on the desert planet Null where his responsibility is to investigate to wreck of another ship and to transport its crew to safety.  Although everybody is anxious to get the job done and to leave the inhospitable world, Eli feels that it is imperative for him to spend his last moments there making a quick exploration below the surface of Null in one of the many alien hexadron boring machines found on the surface.<br />Thus begins a wonderfully told and realized adventure of Eli's meeting with the ancient subterranean race of Ahtra.  The story is so masterfully told that we can clearly visualize and comprehend the complex alien culture, and understand their motivations in dealing with the problematic stranger in their midst.<br />While the story underground is evolving, life on the surface of Null is changing rapidly and catastrophically for the remaining humans.  The planet has its own bioligical imperitives at work, and human life is not a high priority.<br />In spite of the dark events that drive this story or, perhaps, because of them, the resolution of this gripping tale is uplifting and hopeful.  A fitting conclusion to a wonderful adventure.<br />I highly recommend Tropic Of Creation, and I anxiously await the next fine work by Kay Kenyon.	2001-05-20
US	53084715	RP6LMLA368BPO	0553578863	987904883	The Memory of Fire	Books	3	2	3	N	Y	Intense but not gratifying	I like the writing of George Foy enough to buy every one of his books that appears.  I thoroughly relished &quot;The Shift&quot;, found &quot;Contraband&quot; less pleasing and more difficult, and find &quot;The Memory of Fire&quot; to be even more so.<br />The characterization is excellent, as is Foy's wonderful use of language and his ability to evoke vivid and realistic scenes in which to place his action.  I enjoyed getting to know a great deal about Soledad MacRae; her personal experiences, her inner life as a musician, her relationships with Jorge and Stix and the other characters that crossed her path.  Foy made life in the Cruces very real in my mind, and I liked &quot;being there&quot;.<br />In spite of its intriguing exotic atmosphere, I found the novel wanting.  It moves very slowly, but jumps erratically between the time frames and places from which Soledad is escaping.  Even though the story gradually heats up to a violent action packed conclusion, I felt that I was getting ever more bogged down and plodding through it.  I wasn't carried along by its final energy.<br />I suggest passing on this one, and keeping an eye on whatever comes next from Foy.  I love his writing and hope that his next effort has more than atmosphere.	2001-05-06
US	53084715	RIM43AP7D5U1I	0553579959	205121642	Distance Haze	Books	4	4	4	N	Y	A compelling look into the heart of religious experience.	Nasir is obviously deeply attached to the question of dreams and their relationship to our experience of reality.  As in &quot;Tower Of Dreams&quot;, the primary character in &quot;Distance Haze&quot; is intrigued and confounded by his dreams, by their implications, and by the deep basic question of &quot;what is our reality&quot;.<br />Our writer hero, Wayne Dolan, is drawn out of his humdrum distressing life by a chance to get away to a hidden enclave of brilliant thinkers and scientists at the Deriwelle Institute where the issue at hand is the scientific basis of religion.  Numerous methods are being used to identify and quantify in a rigorously scientific way the origin of religious experience as it springs forth from our biological human brains.<br />This deep quest is set in an otherworldly beautiful environment on the coast of Lake Michigan.  Nasir's descriptions of life by the lake, of the numinous colors and feelings evoked by it is most wonderful. Dolan's sense of the lake as he approached it for the first time had me gripped tightly, and I reveled in his experiences of it.<br />Add to this palate the complicated relationships between Dolan and the members of the Institute, and his disturbing love affair with a woman from the nearby town of St. Clair.  Now throw in a heaping handful of Dolan's visionary experiences with an Indian advisor that visits him in his dream states, and with the charged atmosphere of the Institute and the environs of the Lake, and both Dolan and the reader are transported into the space between dreams and reality where they mix unimpeded, promise everything but answer nothing.<br />Although this is a complicated story with the deepest questions at its heart, it moves quickly and remains beautifully visual and sensual to the end.  A most intriquing end it is; thought provoking and satisfying enough to insure that I will be looking forward to the next dream-like experience that Nasir plays out for us.	2001-04-17

I suspect that the plot did not intrigue or excite, and the few days taken by the actual story seemed very long indeed.<br />I liked Jani Killian, the augmented mystery woman, but her capabilities and purpose were never clearly revealed.  Likewise, the somewhat renegade idomeni alien Tsecha was a curious and intriguing character, borne on tidbits of information about his peoples and history, but not fully realized.<br />This book feels like a promising appetizer to what I hope is a tighter and more satisfying second course.	2001-04-10

The concepts put forth in this plea for sanity in our world dangerously teetering into the new millenium are important and beautifully stated and played out by the characters in &quot;The Truth Machine&quot;.<br />It is a remarkable first novel.  The characterization is excellent and compelling.  The story is an equal partner to the ideas that abound.  There are several sub-plots that are almost as satisfying as the major theme about the societal impact of a device that compells truthfulness in all aspects of human interaction.  Pete's complex character and his relationships with women and with his life long friends David and Diana West are well portrayed as are his relationships and interaction with his demons Reece and Scoggins.  I even enjoyed the character of 22g CP-TLMos, the super computer reporter who relates the major part of this work.<br />My great regret is that we don't have our own phenomenally gifted Pete Robinson to create a Truth Machine for us and to usher in the new era of world wide understanding and communication.<br />This is a thoughtful, absorbing, highly readable and most important statement about our possible future or lack thereof.<br />Very highly recommended.	2001-03-28

They related as badly to each other as they did to me.<br />The destruction of most of humanity, and the residual longing generated within the minds of the survivors of the virus for contact with the senders of the virus message, felt like a shakey foundation for a story that meandered to an equally shakey conclusion.<br />I was not informed, I was not involved, I was not surprised, and I was not particularly happy to have spent the time that I devoted to this book.<br />Not a keeper.	2001-03-23

Cley, as we meet him, is a most unsympathetic and brutal personage.<br />Sent on a mission from the &quot;Well-Built City&quot;, fashioned by Master of the Realm Drachton Below as a massive mnemonic device to contain and stimulate his memories, to the backwater mining town of Anamasobia in the Northern Territory, Cley finds he is overcome by the circumstances and the curious inhabitants of the town.<br />His accelerating descent forces him to the island of Doralice where he is left to suffer in the hands of the strange Corporal Matters brothers and the true ruler of Doralice, Silencio the ape.<br />He is eventually released and continues on his path to redemption.<br />I definitely read through all of this adventure with sustained interest in the fate of Cley, the almost perfect Arla, the partially roboticized Calloo and the many other bizarre and extraordinarily imaginative characters, and the amazing circumstances in which they find themselves.  The book is dense with wondrous ideas and events that continue to amaze right to the end.  Given that, it is strange to me that the dark forboding feeling never completely leaves one.<br />There is much that is curious here.  As the Well-Built City is the embodiment of the mind of Master Below, so this book gives substance to the strange and wild and fascinating imagination of its author.  I wonder how far his excellent prose and style can take us.<br />I am definitely looking forward to reading Fords continuing adventures of Cley as he gradually recovers his humanity in a world far from our human experiences.<br />Dark, but highly recommended.	2001-03-09

His evocative details of life in the Middle East create a most realistic and delicious setting for his deeper concerns.<br />Likewise, his powerful concept of mining the collective unconscious for super potent images that will enhance advertising and strongly manipulate the unawares is an intriguing suggestion of what our future might well hold.<br />Our hero, Blaine Ramsey, is adept in both of these arenas, dutifully doing his job as a somewhat staid image digger until one particular image begins to dangerously control his awareness.<br />The characterization is wonderfully handled as Blaine seeks out the source of his distraction and gradually abandons his rigid constraints in the pursuit of the unobtainable Buthaina.<br />When the intense clash of personalities and events has finally run its course we are left with a touching sense of wonder, and much to ponder.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-03-03

It provides much to ponder that is relevant to our true lives and worthy of serious consideration.<br />Which ever you crave, good strong characters involved in high adventure, a glimpse of what the near future might hold, grist for your mind and heart to mull over, you'll happily find it here.<br />Highly recommended!	2001-02-24

They all change attitudes and even personalities at the drop of an opportunity.  And how many times did our Murphy bemoan her condition as a victim, unable to continue in her battle against the forces of evil, only to once again come to the fore and triumph.<br />The wondrous ship and space suit combination warp all concepts of physics beyond any possible rationalization other than the author's need for a thrilling and unlikely plot.<br />I didn't hate it, but I didn't much like it either.

Ruth is aware that any hint or idea from outside can drastically change the culture that she has discovered, but it appears that change has already begun with the invention, by farmer and narrator Yves Gundron, of a harness for his horse.  Before Yves embarked on his inventing, the carts of Mandragora had only one wheel, and horses were attached to them with a rope around their neck which inevitably led to death by strangulation.<br />Yves' family generously takes in Ruth, gives her a pallet on their floor, becomes central to the world shaking changes yet to occur.<br />This story is told in Yves' voice with occassional footnote explanations by Ruth. He speaks most poetically and reverently of the basic lives lived by the Mandragorans, of his relationship with God and with his many relatives past.  He is so well painted, as are Ruth, his family members and the characters of the town and the nearby &quot;city&quot; of Nnms, that we convincingly share his world view and his fears and feelings.<br />Although yet another tale of the &quot;fall from grace&quot;, I found this novel to be a touching, poetic and exhilarating read.<br />Very highly recommended!	2001-02-06

Little remains of the intensity of his &quot;Forever War&quot; experiences, and his main focus now is coping with his growing kids and his craving for a worthwhile future.<br />A rash attempt to escape the stolid civilization enforced by MAN and the Taurans by heading out in a pirated relativistic space ship suddenly turns strange indeed.  Instead of returning in the far distant future, they return only 25 years later to find a mystery that defies the laws of physics.<br />Like some of the other reviewers, I felt that the final chapters of this story were too rushed, but the ideas the Haldeman presents are stunning.  I just couldn't turn off that light, in spite of the grumbles next to me in bed, and I was completely absorbed and delighted as I read through to the last page.<br />Excellent realistic characters that we care about; a multi-level story with a great and curious ending.<br />Definitely a hit!	2001-01-31

George Turner's dark vision of human life on Earth after the catastrophic fall of civilization, so vividly and convincingly portrayed in his wonderful &quot;Drowning Towers&quot; and &quot;Down There In The Darkness&quot;, lives yet again in &quot;Genetic Soldier&quot;.<br />This novel tells of the return to Earth of the 300 person crew of the starship SEARCH after 700 years of travel between the stars in search of another habitable planet.  They have visited over 30 possible planets, found all inhospitable, and are finally driven &quot;home&quot; by a homesickness that brought them to the brink of mutiny and despair.<br />The crew has actually only aged about 30 years since most of the voyage time was spent in a time suspended cryogenic sleep.  And so it is that the far distant relations of the people now living on Earth seek to be readmitted into what has evolved into an alien culture.  Those who outlived the trials and terrors of the past have no place for the returning carriers of catastrophe and seek to force them to leave Earth once again and forever.<br />The gene Wizards of the old world, in preparation for the inevitable fall, had engineered a new humanity with strict adherence to a specific genetic plan that would produce beings most capable of survival in the coming dark ages.  One of these genetic classes is the Soldier Genetic with members bred to great endurance and fortitude.<br />It falls to our hero Atkins' Tommy, also known as Soldier, to deal with the unwanted visitors, and his struggle and eventual surprising triumph is the stuff of this tale.<br />Typically wonderful characterization by Turner, with complex and convincing players, makes this philosophical commentary on our present path a powerful and poignant statement.  Tommy finds himself trapped by his genetic constitution in a plot that surprises and intrigues.<br />I felt that the ending was perhaps a bit too convenient, but I also feel that Turner's message is important and should be carried to every ear.<br />Find this out-of-print book.

I also liked the glimpses of the possible future life on Mars and Earth, and the future of enhanced human appearance.<br />All in all I found this a bit off-putting but an interesting read nonetheless.	2001-01-21
US	53084715	R3M5ZGW2N4FIGS	0451457927	153972036	Call from a Distant Shore	Books	4	20	22	N	Y	Extremely absorbing and entertaining!	I found this, Stephen Burns second novel, to be not as intellectually compelling as his most excellent &quot;Flesh And Silver&quot;, but a most enjoyable and exciting adventure nonetheless.<br />A typical good guys vs the bad guys story, the good guys here are a group of six humans who are interrupted in their complex lives by a mentally deafening call for help that just can't be ignored.  The bad guys are all the rest who don't hear the call and can't believe their stories of an alien presence in dire need.<br />I loved the characters and the characterization.  Burns really brought them all to vivid and interesting life and compelled me to avidly follow their progress towards a noble and world changing goal.<br />This is only a mild social statement, not much science in the fiction, but it is a darn good read that started out a bit slow and then came to a screaming finish.  A great feeling of aaaahhhhh at the end.<br />Try it, you'll really like it!	2001-01-19

I was surprised at how much tension Danvers develops within the deceptively simple style of this book.<br />It does require that we, like Erik, suspend our disbelief for the duration, but I found it well worth while.<br />A fast but very pleasing excursion into another possible reality.<br />I recommend it.	2001-01-11

Time in virtual space passes at a much much slower rate than normal time.<br />The characters of this tale inhabit both the real and virtual spaces and times as they work out their own involvements with the impending &quot;Encroachment&quot;, and their attempts to avoid a catastrophic end to all life on Earth.<br />I stumbled along, enjoying the trip but not the struggle.  An interesting trip it was, but now on to lighter fare for a while.<br />Interesting but not an easy read.	2001-01-06

I am pretty much stuck on Festina Ramos, formerly an &quot;Expendable&quot; Explorer and presently a problematic Lieutenant Admiral of the futuristic Outward Fleet.  She's tough, sharp, well trained and effective, and gets herself into righteously outrageous situations and, happily, out again.<br />I felt that Gardner's previous Festina tale, &quot;Hunted&quot;, was not up to snuff, but this one had me fully in its grip!  We learn about the Ooloms and the Freeps in this one as well as the &quot;Peacocks&quot;, alien races all and vividly realized by Gardner.  A mysterious phenomena on the planet Demoth has felled most of the Ooloms and threatens more horrendous disaster unless our new heroine, Faye Smallwood, can survive and conquer the many forces aligned against her.  These include her own personal ghosts as well as vicious government agents and various other enemys.<br />I very much liked the personal side of Faye, her relationships with her human friends and &quot;family&quot;, with Festina and with her alien friends and coworkers.  Her personal development is a major factor in this story and is expertly handled by Gardner.<br />The action is enticing and exciting, driven by very interesting concepts and by characters that we really care about.  The frequently humorous style and dialogue enhances this energetic ride to a most satisfying conclusion.<br />HIghly recommended, and I'm definitely looking forward to more of this series from Gardner.	2000-12-26

I love experiences that test my concepts and perceptions of reality, and this book sits right in the center of that.<br />VURT, you must know, refers to virtual reality; an alternate experience just a feather's touch away.  In Jeff Noon's creation, the doorway between the worlds is a feather with which you stroke your throat.  The feathers are created and edited by beings existing in more than one reality, and different colors of feathers create different types of experiences.<br />Aside from the concepts which really got to me, I found the characterization and the pace and style of the writing extremely well done and engaging.  I liked all of the human and hybrid participants tearing wildly through this adventure.  I liked the tension that built up as they reaped the deserts of their actions, and I liked the conclusion that left me panting and pondering and wanting more!<br />No computers, but a heavy cyberpunk outlook and feel.<br />Wonderful!!!	2000-12-20

George Turner has an extraordinary way with characters and situations in a human culture rapidly on its way down.  This novel is an enthralling snapshot before it hits bottom.<br />No aliens, no hard sci-fi, just an appalling vision of a degraded society reduced to &quot;sweets&quot; and &quot;swill&quot;.  Turner requires few words to paint a dense and intense reality peopled with unlovable but heroic and respectable individuals.<br />The story is told in the several voices of its players, a well employed technique that permits insight into the otherwise obscure internal worlds of the actors.<br />The main plot is concerned with a relatively brief incident that becomes a fulcrum on which are balanced and revealed remarkable revelations of the past that led to this extremity and of the possible futures that inaction and lack of forethought might well bring.<br />A most thought provoking and worrying novel, an intense good read, a plea for wisdom and more than just being.<br />Read this book!!!	2000-12-15

They were described but not brought to life.<br />I therefore read through it to discover what happened, but was in no way gripped by it or compelled to become more involved in the story.  I never did understand the &quot;souls in bottles&quot; phenomenon and found it simply a mechanical device to support the plot.<br />The conclusion brought with it a feeling of hmmmmmm, okay.  I much prefer a resounding AHA! or at least some tugging at my feelings and understanding.<br />Interesting, merely interesting.	2000-12-04

The story is extremely well written and very absorbing, but it takes several great leaps and in so doing leaves the previous plots and major characters behind.  The second problem stems from the fact that the author was Australian and has incorporated a fair amount of Australian Koori lore and Australian vernacular into his tale.<br />That said, I found it a remarkable book.  Each &quot;section&quot; is very interesting in its own right.  Turner's dark vision of a future Earth is well rendered and gives considerable pause to reflect.  The characters are finely wrought, but I feel that the star of this effort is the concept itself.<br />The intense drama revolving around the &quot;cleansing&quot; of the Earth is as much a shock to us as it is to Gus, one of the few survivors from the bitterly difficult earlier times.  The ending of the story is a curious and curiously refreshing twist that speaks of hope and lifts us above the dark brew.<br />Not a simple read, but highly recommended.	2000-10-26

Beware that some of the details of her time at the Institute for the Criminally Insane are extremely grotesque and distressing.<br />Despite my reservations about these vivid descriptions, I found the plot and its characters to be totally involving and fascinating.  I liked Siggy immensely and was pleased and touched by her ability to cope and to grow beyond the circumstances that often threatened her.  I found the humans, the &quot;speedies&quot; and the rest of the other-than-human beings to be very well realized and so intriguing that they still pop up in my memory and welcome further contemplation.<br />A good story, good actors well drawn, strange twists and unusual space and time concepts, an exciting and gratifying ending.<br />I rarely feel that a book is worth 5 stars, but this one got to me and wouldn't let go.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-10-18

Lee Wood's &quot;Bloodrights&quot; begins in the small confines of a feudal wintery forest as we travel through it with Antonya and begin to learn about this curious young woman who may be a thief, a spy, or one of the Wierd.  She is remarkably strong, resourceful and self-reliant.<br />Our concept of her universe grows as we watch her deftly track and eventually capture the magnificent Defender Kerrick who, despite himself, is enlisted in her growing plans.<br />The action quickly rises as the two play out a scheme to overturn local kingdoms and consolidate them into a force sufficient to attack the Citadel itself.<br />The plot surges to new heights and then suddenly drops back before plunging upward yet again.  Surprises abound and keep us firmly in the relentless grip of this story.<br />Like a snowball that has turned into an avalance, events explode in deadly and unexpected ways until we finally pass beyond the turmoil and suffering to the hard won conclusion of this wonderful tale.<br />The many characters and circumstances are all finely wrought and intensely believable.  They are strong people at the limits of their abilities to act or to cope with the powerful twists of the fate that is testing them.  Their relationships are as fascinating as their personalities.  I was particularly intrigued by Antonya's connection to Kerrick and to Morgan the Assassin.<br />I found Wood's first novel &quot;Looking For The Mahdi&quot; to be an excellent read but was disappointed by &quot;Farraday's Orphans&quot;.  &quot;Bloodrights&quot; is an exciting and gratifying read and fully redeems my faith in Wood.<br />I highly recommend it!	2000-10-12

This book begins 50 years after Czerneda's fine story &quot;Beholder's Eye&quot; ended.<br />We now find Paul Ragem and Esen-alit-Quar living as partners of the trading company &quot;Cameron &amp; Ki&quot; on the fringe planet Minas XII.  Their comfortable and amusing life is interrupted when Paul takes the reluctant Es on a &quot;vacation&quot; trip.<br />We continue to meet wonderfully detailed alien cultures and to follow the amusing escapades of the hapless shape changing Es as she continues her dedication to understanding and protecting all sentient lives.  The fact that Paul shares the same goals is complicated by the desire of each to protect the other from the inevitable tribulations of their complicated life together.<br />I felt that this book started out slower than &quot;Beholder's Eye&quot; but came to no less satisfying a conclusion.  In each case, Czerneda has demonstrated her considerable skill at portraying remarkably different beings and cultures in a way that makes them comfortably familiar, intriguing and exciting to us.  Her plots are absorbing and her writing is eminently readable.<br />I'm decidedly looking forward to the next installment of Web Shifters!	2000-10-03

I found this story quite interesting right up to the intense conclusion which left me a bit cold.  I can best compare the feeling to finding one of those large jars that you might discover on the back shelf of an antiques store, filled with a murky liquid and with something not quite right floating in it.  An intriguing curiosity but I don't want to get too close!<br />The characterization was well done.  I loved Sam, the deaf super-hacker friend of the hero Freddie.  The polymorph, Lee, was very well done and quite believable (within the necessary and somewhat strained suspension of disbelief).  I had a problem with Freddie who was well written but was subjected to so many assaults on his friendship and understanding that he must have been superhumanly cool and compasionate.<br />And now to protagonist Lee, antagonist and devil Bonito, and polymorphism.  I've enjoyed other shape changing novels, such as those by Czerneda, but this one gave &quot;genuine&quot; insite into the nature of (Westerfield's) polymorphic beings, and the development of their bizarre abilities.  He dwells at some length on their insight into human anatomy and mannerisms, gained in various ways, necessary to convincingly emulate another human.<br />I guess that I was hoping for a simpler, more uplifting ending, but taking it for what it was I will certainly recommend this book to those seeking insight into yet another extraordinary possibility in the range of beings that might exist.	2000-09-22

Nyland's &quot;Signal to Noise&quot; is at times confusing, at times deep,  and at all times absorbing.<br />The &quot;good&quot; are his remarkable ideas  that truly provoke off-line (or off-book) pondering: the mysterious enzyme,  a trade from the alien Wheeler (and dealer?) and what it's effect might be  on different personalities; Jack Potter's forced mental implant and it's  effect on his psi capabilities; the &quot;gateway&quot; with the puzzles of  its power source and its capabilities.  Probably included in this short  list is Nylund's visualization of software code when Jack is absorbed in  the virtual reality wherein he is a supreme expert at synthesizing new  information from a complex of myriad data streams.<br />The &quot;bad&quot;  are the confused and confusing relationships between Jack and his 2 friends  and business partners, Jack and the ominous NSO governmental spy  organization, Jack and the alien Wheeler.  Each twist of the tale brings  surprising and dangerous changes to what we cautiously took as real.<br />The  &quot;ugly&quot; is the final result of Jack's new found ability to  communicate.<br />Don't be put off by all this.  I relished the characters,  all of them including &quot;Uncle&quot; Reno, the super-spy Panda, the gene  witch Zero and the entire rest of the cast.  They all took their assigned  roles and played them to perfection.<br />I highly recommend this intriguing  and thought provoking adventure.	2000-09-15

If you LOVE Gardner's female protagonist Festina Ramos (as I do) you'll  LIKE &quot;Hunted&quot;.<br />I found this book pleasant but somewhat slow  going until I approached the end where it picked me up and kept me  up!<br />Gardner again introduces us to several fascinating and well realized  alien races, the Balrog and the Mandasars, and he expertly weaves the  thought provoking relationships between them and our questionably  &quot;human&quot; race.<br />A basic question posed in different ways throught  the story is &quot;what does it mean to be used by others&quot;?  Is it  always bad; can it be beneficial to both parties.  We are constantly used  in our &quot;normal&quot; contemporary Earthly lives by the organizations  that we work for, that we join, that provide us information and necessary  professional services.  In this complex tale Gardner brings that question  to it's ultimate expression.<br />I continue to be fascinated by Gardner's  skill as a writer and as a creator of tangible and sensible realities that  include a wonderful panoply of possible different beings.  I liked  &quot;Expendable&quot; more than &quot;Hunted&quot;, but I will surely  continue to read everything that Gardner generously puts out for our  entertainment and deep consideration.	2000-09-08

I felt like I was bobbing in a troubled sea, waves and currents  increasing from many directions until they finally generated a great  concluding waterspout.<br />All of the curious characters are finely wrought;  John Orr and his dreams real and made up, his temptress Abberlaine Arrol,  the barbarian swordsman and his familiar, Andrea and her lover(s).<br />Not  unlike seeing some movies of late (&quot;The 6th Sense&quot; comes to mind)  I felt ready and needing to reread &quot;The Bridge&quot; upon its  conclusion.  To help settle the images, ideas and plots that it had planted  in my imagination, and because the delicious texture and pace of the novel  invites the wish that it wouldn't end quite yet.<br />I can't call this  CyberPunk, but it feels familiarly like it.  I can't say that it's  post-apocolyptic but it feels that way too.  Two of my favorite genres  disguised as the dark world of Iain Banks' &quot;The Bridge&quot;.<br />An  intense compelling read indeed!	2000-08-31

The main characters seem lost most of the time which explains why the reader was as well.<br />The extension  of the AR &quot;hotsuits&quot; to faster levels through the use of drugs  served no notable purpose.  The imagery was tattered and scattered.

I found that this book didn't live up to my expectations.<br />I relished the character of Morgan and hoped that he would prove to be more than he  eventually was.  Great potential but a ho-hum finish.<br />Sira was  interesting, but in an author imposed fog most of the time, and I felt that  none of the other characters were particularly sympathetic or  compelling.<br />The concept of the M'hir was new to me and I liked the idea  of the Clan that could exist in both the M'hir and our Earthly domain, but  the ability to travel through space to a remembered spot is not new or well  done.<br />I stayed with the story, waiting for a surprising or exciting  finale and felt let down.	2000-08-13

I found the concept of Bergmann Surgeons quite intriguing, that the  &quot;ghost&quot; pains of an amputated limb might be the clue to an  extended realm of sensation and action.<br />This forms the basis of the  complex and involving journey of Dr. Georgory Marchey back from his life of  drunken escape to total involvement in his new world and friends.<br />I found  the characters very strongly realized and I was kept up well beyond my  usual bedtime as I read on to the the gripping and somewhat sentimental  conclusion.  (I actually had tears in my eyes - that's how sweet it was!).  The evolution of Angel/Scylla and the relationship between her and Marchey  pulled me onwards as did Marchey's mental combat with Brother Fist.<br />My  gripes are few: I felt that the repetitive descriptions of Marchey's  drinking were a bit heavy handed, and Brother Fists contribution to the  total outcome seemed a bit simplistic.<br />Despite these qualms, I highly  recommend this read to all who love seeing a GOOD idea worked out with  strong characters who eventually triumph.	2000-08-03

I was certainly intrigued by Heyoka Blackeagle, the main character in this highly imaginative novel, as we follow him on his quest to understand himself and his place in both his birth and his adopted  civilizations.<br />The intense descriptions of the Hrinn culture with its  varied characters and unique mythos create an extensive and realistic stage  in our imaginations upon which the drama is played out.<br />As I read on, I  found myself staying up later and later each night until the truly  thrilling and satisfying conclusion that left me with much to ponder.<br />My  objections to this book are to the author's repetitive dwelling on certain  certain aspects such as the pain associated with Heyoka's leg wound, how  difficult and important it is for him to control his claws, how vile  certain things smell, that become somewhat tedious and tend to break the  spell.  I also feel that Heyoka's partner, Mitsu, was largely extraneous;  more of a problem than a strong contributor to the quality of the tale, as  were curious personal features such as his double thumbs and double rows of  teeth.<br />All in all, however, it was a very interesting exploration of some  possible alien cultures, and a satisfying story of self-realization.	2000-07-29

I found the basic concept of this book, that particularly ugly members of our future technocracy are considered expendable, to be patently untenable.  Perhaps that's just wishful thinking on my part and Gardner has it right -  alas!<br />As we progress in this, Festina Ramos' absorbing adventure, we  befriend a number of well fleshed out and interesting characters.  I admit  to feeling that the characterization, as the plot, was a bit heavy handed,  but I certainly enjoyed it.<br />Swept along in her discovery of the secrets  of the exile planet Melaquin, Festina gradually loses everything that she  holds dear.  She remains firmly rooted in her distinct personality,  however, and finally triumphs in a most unexpected way.<br />This book, like  many of my favorites, didn't end as I turned the last page.  Even now,  mulling over it to write this review, I am struck by new realizations of  the deeper purpose and meaning of Melaquin, that..... Noooooo, you'll have  to read it yourself.<br />Bravo James Alan Gardner, and thank you.  I'll  certainly look for more Festina and more Gardner.	2000-07-23

I very much like Sujata Massey's style, and I am quite taken with her main character Rea Shimura.  I also like the views that Massey gives us of Japanese life through the eyes of a Westerner.<br />I felt that this, her  third novel, was another pleasureable romp, following Rea as she gets  unwillingly involved in and solves yet another mystery.<br />I found, however,  that this tale did not fire my interest as her others had.  I enjoyed  meeting her friends again and watching a new man enter that circle.  I  liked the insights into Ikebana culture.<br />I only gave it three stars,  however, because I felt that the the lengthy build-up led to a surprising  but not particularly exciting resolution.  As I finally closed the book my  feeling was - Okay, hmmm.  Nowhere near a Wow!<br />I have no doubt that other  readers who, like me, anticipate the latest Massey story will want to read  this one.

The other reviews of &quot;Beholder's Eye&quot; give a good description of the plot, so I would like to focus on the nature and development of the main characters, Esen-alit-Quar and her recent friend Paul-human, both of  whom I found most compelling.<br />Czerneda has brought forth an entirely new  (to me) being within the universe.  In trying to understand the nature of  that being I felt that the story started out a bit slow, but as my  comprehension grew I became quite rapt and regretted that it was not  longer.<br />Most exciting was the &quot;personal&quot; growth of Esen as her  responsibility extended to the point at which she alone could meet and,  hopefully, quell the ultimate threat to her kind.  She takes numerous alien  forms along her path, each one remarkably well portrayed and fleshed out.  Her reluctant relationship with Paul Ragem inspires her to see and  comprehend herself in a deeper and more compasionate way, and to learn to  rely on her own personal understanding of her place in the scheme of  things.<br />All in all, this excellent book was very thought provoking,  compelling to the end, and it certainly whetted my appetite for more!	2000-07-12

Vinge has created several most intriguing alien races with totally non-human attributes.  The interaction of these being with the human protagonists is very interesting and well  done.<br />This novel about &quot;saving humanity&quot; takes place in a  universe with novel physical laws.  As one travels upwards from our  galactic plane, physical and mental processes are accelerated from the  slowness of the &quot;unthinking depths&quot; (where we presently reside!)  to the beyond where super mentalities exist.<br />The inadvertant  creation/release of such a super demon by unwitting humans leads to an  almost futile attempt to restore order.<br />You will surely be fascinated by  the lupine race living under &quot;medieval&quot; conditions, by the  ancient Skroderiders and by the mysterious &quot;human&quot; character Pham  Nuwen as they all play a part in the human's search for salvation.	2000-06-14

I found this story an amusing diversion from my usual diet of futuristic nanotech hard sci fi.<br />There's not much plot to support the single excellent premise of a company reaching back in time and creating immortal  operatives who then live into the future preserving cultures and artifacts  as they go.  This book is more like a few long stories linked by that  idea.<br />I was bothered at first by the lack of meat, but by the end of the  book I'd let myself settle for a big helping of between meal sweets.<br />I  would have loved to have a few of the obvious loose ends properly explained  or wrapped up.  Perhaps Baker will do so in a later book.<br />All in all, a  pleasant diversion, light and enjoyable.	2000-05-23

I found it extremely hard to get into, struggled to keep interested in it and, finally, felt rather let down by a lackluster and unimpressive  ending.<br />Were it not for the glossary, buried near the end of the book, I  would have found it totally incomprehensible and never pursued it to it's  disappointing lack of finale.<br />Unlike many of the hard SF books that I  have greatly enjoyed, I was unimpressed with the attempts to link the plot  to scientific theory.  The characters were minimally developed and popped  in and out of the story in a way that made following them most  difficult.<br />Oh well!	2000-05-21

I love looking at the excellent  photographs of early players, ephemera and banjos from the exhibition, but  my favorite part of the book by far is Jim Bollman's information packed  section entitled &quot;The Banjomakers of Boston&quot;.<br />This book has  proven a reliable and surprisingly complete compilation of hard to find  information.  I highly recommend it to banjo collectors, historians,  players of vintage banjos and anybody interested in the story of  &quot;America's instrument&quot; and how it came to be.	2000-04-04
US	53084715	RW62KS4MRBUYG	0441005667	204362253	Forever Peace	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Yet another possible future - a great read!	Darn it!  Here it is, 2:30 in the morning again.  Joe Haldeman's &quot;Forever Peace&quot; was too great a read for me to stop!<br />I've long been interested in issues around the man&lt;=&gt;machine interface.  Contemporary computers, keyboards and screens have remarkably extended our  intellectual reach to the robotic exploration of outer, local and inner  space.  We have developed formidable interpretive methods that enable us to  synthesize and deduce reliable information from often unrelated signals  spread over time, form and distance.<br />The ultimate realization of such an  extension of man and machine might well be Haldeman's &quot;soldier  boys&quot;.  In this exciting and suspenseful novel he has craftily  perfected this interface so that &quot;mechanics&quot; located great  distances from the soldier boy machines have complete sensory and  functional control.<br />Even more wonderful, he has humanized the interface  by linking the multiple minds, histories and realities of the several or  many persons that &quot;jack&quot; together.<br />His vision of the  consequences of such a linking, and how vividly he expressed it, fascinated  me. I found the characters and the concepts extremely interesting, intense  and believable.  The suspense built right up to a thrilling conclusion that  left me slightly breathless and just itching to sit down and say something  about it.<br />For readers who like to ponder our possible futures this is a  fine vision to add to their collection.	2000-04-02

Any one of these three aspects  would be sufficient reason to own the book.<br />The frequently startling and  personal photographs impart a very human feeling as we progress through the  story of the evolution of the banjo in American culture.  Amazingly, they  represent just a minor fraction of Jim Bollman's immense  collection.<br />Special praise is due Peter Szego for his magnificent  photographs of the wonderful early banjos from his own collection.<br />I find  it hard to remain objective as I turn the pages and imagine what it must  have been like to pose for one of those Dageurreotypes, rudely dressed,  banjo in hand, daring the photographer to capture my soul.  And again, when  I turn to that favorite Boucher or Fairbanks banjo and long to feel and  play it.<br />Well done, gentlemen, and thank you!	2000-03-17

It's a keeper.	2000-03-17

Published in 1984 and originally sold for $28, it is now long out of print and  frequently brings more than $200 at online auction and private sales.  The first half of this 168-page book is a highly illustrated history of  4-string resonated banjos entitled &quot;Banjos of the Jazz Age&quot;.  It  devotes sections to each important brand name, with historical charts  showing the introduction and characteristics of the various available  models.  Next follow a strong section on ukuleles and banjo ukuleles,  historical catalog covers from banjo manufacturers, and a short section on  classical 5-string banjos, primarily S.S.Stewart, Tsumura's favorite.  The following section on the Jim Bollman banjo collection, included because  of the importance of it's banjos not available in the Tsumura collection,  is a rare and enticing glimpse into the phenomenal collection by this  long-time zealous collector.  Thereafter follows brief sections on early  banjo related music covers, banjo recordings and postcards.  Finally there  are strong sections on Minstrel Era banjos, curios, and a very important  section on banjo related patents.  In all, it is one of the very few  compendiums of useful and necessary photographic information for the banjo  enthusiast, collector and player.  It is an aid to identifying and placing  specific instruments in their historical perspective.  It is a superb  &quot;dream&quot; book for those of us consumed by love of the instrument  and dreaming about our next favorite possession.  The only other books  of comparable importance in providing a visual understanding of the banjo  are Tsumura's gigantic tome &quot;1001 Banjos, the Tsumura Collection&quot;  (out of print and soon unavailable, at $500) and Webb's wonderful  &quot;Ring the Banjar&quot;, the highly illustrated and informative catalog  of the 1984 MIT Museum exhibition.  I highly recommend buying all 3  books, but if you can only choose 2, get Webb and then Tsumura's Red Book.e 1984 MIT Museum exhibition.

This 18 pound tome needs a bookstand to appreciate it, and a bib to prevent you from drooling on the pages.  It has 3000 exquisite art photographs of banjos covering their entire history from the most primitive through the most modern.  Although there is wonderful coverage of S.S.Stewart presentation 5-strings and other classic open back 5-strings, the bulk of the book is 4-string banjos, Tsumura's favorite.  Almost every notable brand and model is gloriously represented. This was originally published as an edition of 2500 and cost far more to produce than the $500 selling price.  It will probably become a collector's item.	1998-01-21
